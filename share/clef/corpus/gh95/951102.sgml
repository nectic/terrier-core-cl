THE Scottish Rugby Union has appointed Edinburgh-based Dunseath
Citigate Communications as advisers on PR and media relations. SRU
president Dr Iain Todd said the appointment reflected the heightened
profile of the game, particularly since the World Cup, and the greater
need for the Union to ensure that its vision for the future is
understood at all levels of the game.

SCOTTISH champion Peter Nicol, who has struggled to hit form following
a tonsils operation in June, has dropped four places to No.8 in the
world rankings announced yesterday.
It is the 22-year-old's lowest ranking since May last year. Nicol, the
No.2 to Peter Marshall for the whole of last season, is now the
fifth-ranked Briton, having been overtaken by Simon Parke, Del Harris,
and Chris Walker.
The two other ranked Scots have achieved personal bests. Oban's Martin
Heath, winner of the Philadelphia Open last weekend, has moved up three
places to 30, while Stuart Cowie has jumped up 12 spots to 62. Jansher
Khan remains No.1 with Australia's Rodney Eyles leap-frogging Marshall
to No.2.

REGULAR debate takes place on the impact which future advancements in
information technology may have on the workplace. However, little
attention has been paid to the revolution taking place in the world's
oldest ''new'' technology -- the telephone.
Admittedly, Sir Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the first
telephone back in 1877 has come a long way from those days. Indeed, the
ever increasing need for a whole host of businesses to talk to their
clients on a regular basis, often outwith ''normal'' working hours,
coupled with the need for higher levels of customer service, has led to
remarkable changes in the use of the common telephone.
These changes in turn are proving to have a very positive impact on
the Glasgow office market.
The evolution of the ''call centre'' is now upon us. Practically
everyone's life, whether on a business or a personal basis, has been
touched by the new phenomenon. Whether these are ''inbound'' services,
for example direct banking, helplines, insurance quotations, or
''outbound'' services such as telesales campaigns; all have one thing in
common -- they are staffed by a collection of well educated, pleasantly
mannered and enthusiastic individuals eager to please or to make your
life just a little bit easier.
The concept of the call centre may not be entirely new. However, much
of the credit for its steadily increasing expansion and success is due
to an initiative by the Glasgow Development Agency's business relocation
team.
Over the last two-and-a-half years the GDA team has been researching
the call centre market, identifying the key players and basically
getting to know what makes a successful call centre operation.
The culmination of this work resulted in a call centre conference in
July of this year, sponsored at Glasgow's Hilton Hotel, which attracted
239 delegates. Principal speakers included three of the country's
leading call centre consultants -- Paul Swainbank of the TSB, Anne-Marie
Forsyth of Network Scotland and Peter Massey of Aspen.
Evidence, if indeed any evidence were needed, that the call centre is
not merely a passing novelty but a serious business generator set to
stand the test of time.
The call centre phenomenon has taken off throughout the UK, leading to
new business opportunities and new jobs.
Many factors influence the location of a call centre operation, and
through the work of the GDA and several others, Glasgow is now at the
forefront of the call centre market.
So what does Glasgow have to offer potential call centre operators?
For starters, Glasgow offers a well educated, outgoing and
enthusiastic workforce. A combination of high achieving school-leavers,
graduates and mothers returning to work offer a unique blend of skills
not readily available elsewhere in the country.
Scottish Enterprise, through its network of local enterprise companies
and private sector support, has been proactive in establishing a range
of generic training mechanisms to meet the long term needs of the
market.
Generic training on offer covers all aspects of telephone skills,
customer service, team working, assertiveness and keyboard skills.
On the property front, Glasgow is able to offer call centre operators
an extensive range of premises. Unlike headquarters facilities, call
centre operators require a wide variety of properties. In short, there
is no single standard required.
Many call centre operators have opted for city/town centre properties
which offer convenient travel for staff, which is particularly important
where shifts are worked. Edge of town or out-of-town locations can often
offer a different, perhaps less costly, working environment.
Indeed, an examination of the 35 call centre operations already up and
running, very successfully, in and around the city, reveals a diverse
picture. Premises include large and small buildings, high specification
offices with raised access floors and air conditioning to converted
industrial units such as the one recently acquired by Kwik-Fit at
Tannochside, Lanarkshire, for their new car insurance operation. Each
one, however, offers its occupier the right mix of image, specification
and cost to suit their particular needs.
In addition to the early successes in attracting British Airways
Reservations Facility to Atrium Court, and the soaraway success of the
high-profile Direct Line Insurance operation, other recent notable
successes include the establishment of the BBC Radio Helpline. The TSB's
call centre, following the recent announcement of the proposed merger
between the TSB and Lloyds Bank, promises a further 500 to 600 jobs for
the city.

HOPE Springs Eternal could well be the retailers' adage. Reviews of
the Scottish retail market in previous years have portrayed the strength
of its indigenous retailers, the propensity of its public to shop, and
the overall buoyancy of this sector of the economy.
In the heady days of the 1980s, ''inflation-proof shopping'' was the
hackneyed euphemism which neverthless portrayed the truth of a confident
and expanding market.
National retailers exploited their concepts in every high street or
shopping centre from Inverness to Dumfries, mirroring the credit boom.
New opportunities were calculated in degrees of success: failure was
largely an unknown quantity. But where does the market lie now?
Often discussed in generalities, the retail market can no longer be
considered in the traditional boom-bust cycles of earlier retailing
generations. Retailing in the 1990s has become -- nationally -- a more
considered and sophisticated leisure pastime: considered due to the
financial constraints of a recession yet to recede, and sophisticated as
a result of greater public awareness, choice and indeed mobility.
This in turn has led national retailers to re-examine all aspects of
their operations, and to maximise wherever possible existing assets,
particularly those of a fixed nature, such as property.
As a result, a significant proportion of retail demand emerging during
the course of last year has arisen from home grown retailers, which,
together with limited new entrants to the Scottish field, have helped
boost an otherwise lacklustre market.
This, perhaps, is not so surprising. With institutional landlords
striving to achieve rental growth over the halcyon levels of the late
1980s, a more receptive attitude has prevailed both at a national and
local level, enabling companies such as Jeanster, Sports Division, Jean
Scene and Sports Connection to secure locations previously reserved as
the domain of the plc's.
Equally, such retailers have been able to adapt to the varying
customer markets as these have evolved, providing a sound footing as the
''nationals'' of tomorrow. Indeed, all companies noted have in the past
year become a Scottish export, with various forays into the Irish and
English markets.
In fairness, however, home grown retailers represent only part of the
picture. New names have suddenly appeared in shopping centres across the
country.
Like a carefully executed military operation, ''foreign'' ventures
such as New Look and Allsports have sought representation on a
comprehensive scale, providing competitive interest and localised (but
much welcome!) growth to the towns they have secured, and a filip to
property agents, developers and landlords in an otherwise fragmented
market.
Equally, quality locations continue to be the focus of many occupation
requirements, often to the detriment of credible and neighbouring
alternatives.
Thus Princes Street, Edinburgh, Argyle Street, Glasgow and the Bon
Accord Centre, Aberdeen, all continue to buck the trend, with
opportunities for exceptional rental growth and/or capital realisations
for the right product. More so than ever does ''location, location,
location'' apply.
Reading these words, the pessimistic retailer (does such an animal
exist?) might be forgiven for reflecting poorly upon future prospects.
But I believe there is every reason for optimism which, whilst not
recorded in the actual events of 1995, does represent a turning point
for the next five years.
Firstly, the overall consumer market requires, and has to some extent
by default achieved, a period of stability following the huge growth and
subsequently disruptive collapse of the eighties and nineties.
This year can be viewed as having provided that all important pause in
activity as aspirations have stabilised and confidence returned,
providing the footing for sustained growth.
Secondly, the take-up of vacant space, whilst low, has gradually
reached the point where key money is no longer a dirty word, and will
actually promote occupational movement. With trading either up or down,
this activity is essential to kick start the market, with its associated
returns on rental growth and thus investor/developer activity.
Thirdly, there are now a number of shopping centre projects in the
pipeline centred on the major conurbations which provide a clear focus
for the immediate future.
The Trinity Centre, Aberdeen, is to undergo a comprehensive
refurbishment, as is the current position with the Piazza in Paisley;
both the Gyle, Edinburgh, and Thistle Centre, Stirling, are to be
extended to meet anticipated retail demand, and Glasgow will, in time
for the Millennium celebrations, and after much speculation, be able to
enjoy its own John Lewis department store, forming the principal anchor
of the Buchanan Galleries.
And finally, but by no means least, it is appropriate to consider the
out-of-town market. Retail warehousing in Scotland has subsisted for a
period of time, much more so than the rest of the UK, but it is only of
late that we have witnessed developments with a quality of mix or build
as presented by Kinnaird Park in Edinburgh or Kingsgate Retail Park in
East Kilbride.
Recent developments include Berryden Road, Aberdeen, Great Western
Road, Glasgow, and Hermiston Gait, Edinburgh, and the success secured in
pre-letting these schemes has resulted in an outbreak of proposals from
Inverness to Greenock and Kirkcaldy to Hamilton.
Before the end of the decade, it appears every Scottish city or town
will have its own designated retail park to complement its in-town
shopping facilities.
Upon reflection it may just be that 1995 was the year that was.

IN early 1993 the Sun Alliance Group finally gave up its 15-year
ownership of Shawlands Shopping Centre, relinquishing a long held
ambition to see the area transformed into an up-to-date retailing focus.
Whilst the reasons given appear to have had little to do with the centre
itself, it provided an opportunity for a more entrepreneurial team to
take control, and there began a four-year process of realising its
potential which is now approaching its conclusions.
The Shawlands Development Partnership (SDP) was one of the very few
investment syndicates around at the time prepared to take on such a task
after so many years of dilapidation, inactivity and false dawns. It is
especially interesting to note that the lead investor is the
Glasgow-based Western Heritable Investment Trust. They still retain a
substantial residential portfolio out of the many homes built in the
earlier part of this century and are again involving the Clydesdale
Bank.
Historically, Shawlands shopping area has been regarded as one of the
strongest suburban locations and this has been constantly borne out by
the rental levels retailers have been prepared to pay. However, as the
1967 shopping centre has been gradually emptied of strong retailers in
preparation for upgrading, this reputation has been sorely tested given
that, in the centre alone, there are just 42 separate shops, which must
be close to half the total retail offer in the Shawlands area. Add to
this the grey concrete atmosphere of an earlier development era, the
no-go car parking areas, the grubby legacy of poor management and
accumulative vandalism, and one catches a glimpse of the task facing SDP
when it took control.
However, these challenges are very much in a day's work for SDP's lead
partners Melford Securities Limited, whose principal directors have been
in the retail property industry since before this centre was originally
built, and have in the last 10 years handled many varied and in some
cases very large retail developments. They are headed on this project by
David Kerr, who has a long association with Glasgow retail property.
The appointment of a building contractor is virtually the last stage
in a highly technical progress that has been going on for three years
and involves obtaining many local authority consents.
However, these are the peripheral issues on projects of this nature.
The main events having been buying out surplus tenants, particularly The
Burrell Hotel, rearranging others and conceiving a total refurbishment
that not only attracts strong traders but also falls in line with the
high standard now common-place and expected in Glasgow.
The new Arcade will be constructed to keep the link between the two
main thoroughfares of Kilmarnock and Pollokshaws Roads, but in a
dramatically improved manner. A population of 200,000 lives within a
two-and-half-mile radius, and demographically the immediate area is one
of young professionals and first-time buyers.
However, Shawlands draws from the surrounding affluent districts of
Newlands, Giffnock, Muirend and Clarkston, and overall the actual
expenditure of both convenience and comparison goods is considered to be
above the national average for the UK.
SDP found that whilst there is a great deal of strong retailing on the
south side in places like Rutherglen, Pollok and Newton Mearns (a centre
that Western Heritable used to own), Shawlands stood out as independent
from these despite its tired image.
SDP's total investment over and above the purchase cost in 1993 will,
by the end of next year, be in excess of #8m, well over half of which is
just on building work improvements. This is creating 27 new shops,
leaving 16 broadly unaltered but increasing the average size.
The great majority of these units are in the Arcade itself, which is
to be enclosed with a new glass roof and a range of quality materials
including original york paving stones. These enclosed areas give access
to 300 car parking spaces which until now have been little utilised due
to their condition. Refurbishment of this part is already complete
incorporating new circulation arrangements, high levels of lighting and
improved security.
Dawn Construction are the contractors who are due to complete their
work by July next year. Following the departure of Safeway, Kwik Save
(who recently took over the Shoprite store), are to be the food anchor
at the rear of the new arcade and relocation agreements with Farmfoods
and Boots have already been signed to support this.
Healey and Baker's Glasgow office and Molyneux Rose from London are
handling the marketing and leasing, and confirm that they are talking to
a wide range of tenants, a number of whom are or were previously
represented in Shawlands, and are the type of traders one would expect
to find in comparable centres in city suburbs. However, the developers
and their agents expect to tap a far wider market than just convenience
and service trades and have specifically targeted fashion, shoes and the
general household sectors for future lettings.
Despite the subdued levels of activity in the retail industry this is
a project that sets out to rejuvenate what is already there and
re-establish Shawlands to its rightful position with the Glasgow retail
hierarchy. SDP are supremely confident that this will be achieved, and
they will once again have created a robust investment for the future.

WHILE Scotland's Central Belt, Dundee and Aberdeen are obviously
regarded as key indicators of what is happening in Scotland's property
market, it is important not to forget Inverness, the heart of Highland
Region. Here the market can best be described as steady on the retail
and industrial fronts, and the office market is holding its own where
landlords are prepared to offer flexible terms.
Regarding offices, Beechwood is perhaps is the major current
influence. This new development on the outskirts of town has proved
especially popular, with lettings including Water and Sewerage and
Halcrows. Reflecting tourism's role as the single largest employer in
the Highlands and Islands, the Scottish Tourist Board has also now taken
up residence, with its offices sold on as investment.
Rentals for major occupiers at Beechwood are achieving around #10.50
per sq ft, but this new edge-of-town office opportunity is having an
impact on town centre office property.
Highland Health Board is also relocating to Beechwood, and disposing
of its surplus office property comprising the Hilton Hospital, currently
used as offices and residential land, Reay House on the Old Edinburgh
Road, and 26 Southside Road. The Hilton Hospital, a Victorian listed
building with some 14,700 sq ft of offices, also has three acres of
development land suited for low or high density development, the former
matron's house, and two staff cottages.
Reay House, the board's original offices, comprises in excess of 6000
sq ft with adequate parking, although still relatively central, and 26
Southside Road extends to approximately 2000 sq ft of offices.
Essentially, however, the demand for office accommodation in the town
has increased very little, and the attractions of Beechwood -- modern
purpose designed offices with computer trunking and car parking -- are
drawing occupiers away from the centre. But there are significant
lettings in the centre in spite of this -- for instance, 5250 sq ft of
offices in Academy Street let to the Children's Panel at #47,500 per
annum, and the recently completed assignment of 77 Church Street to the
Brook Advisory Council.
One factor which may well affect the market is that of charging rates
on empty properties, which has come into effect with re-valuation. What
we are likely to see now -- and this will be common across Scotland --
is that office rentals may drop as landlords attempt to ensure that
their buildings are occupied so that the burden of rates can be passed
on to the tenant.
On the retail front, the market is strong, particularly in the prime
locations of the High Street and Eastgate where there are very few empty
properties and rents are still showing growth. Good secondary properties
are also in strong demand in areas such as Church Street, where, for
instance, Granada TV Rental recently took a building at a rent of
#25,000 per annum. More retail space will also become available with the
welcome redevelopment of the fire-damaged Queensgate Hotel, which has
now commenced and which will, on completion, provide six shop units with
21 flats above.
Out of town, there is strong demand for non-food retail development,
since currently there is no specific retail park to support this.
Planning permission exists for Stratton Farm which, lying five miles
from Inverness on the east side, may be a little far out.
Tesco Supermarkets have also earmarked a site on the A96 Aberdeen road
two miles from the town, and although this is not identified in the
local plan, the devlopers are seeking consent for it.
Demand is being met at present by the Inshes and Telford Retail Parks,
and a possible extension to Inshes has been identified which would meet
increasing demand as well as cater for other community uses. Subject to
planning permission, this land may provide the solution, and although it
has not yet been openly marketed, considerable interest has already been
established.
Should these new developments go ahead, then it is likely that the
retail park rent barrier, which currently stands at around #9 per sq ft,
will be broken as new spaces become available.
Demand for industrial land, particularly on the Longman Estate, is
also still high, primarily because the council owns the bulk of it, and
will only consider long ground leases. Freehold land is attracting
premium prices, and even small areas can achieve very high prices -- one
site of less than 0.3 of an acre sold for a rate close to #200,000 an
acre, more than double the going rate.
Similarly, an industrial unit sold at 15 Harbour Road for #150,000
showed a rate of #3.00 on the industrial space, and #5.00 on the office
development -- a yield of 14%. Another notable development on the
industrial front is John Menzies new 17,000 sq ft depot on former Gas
Board premises at a rent of #3.75 per sq ft, with offers of over
#160,000 being sought for mthe company's former premises in Burnett Road
comprising some 11,000 sq ft and standing on 0.36 of an acre.
In general, then, the market is steady. This may not be boom time, and
rentals may not be significantly on the increase, but the heart of the
Highlands, in commercial property terms, is in good health.

THE explosive changes that have occurred in Glasgow's retail-driven
renaissance are now to have one further exciting twist. The range of
designers and retailers who have secured space in our colourful city is
second to none, and today it is hard to find a major sector of fashion
and quality retailing which is not represented in depth.
Glasgow boasts designers such as Versace, Armani, Katherine Hamnett,
Nicole Fahri and Paul Costelloe to name but a few, chains such as
Jigsaw, Whistles and Monsoon have flourished within the city for many
years and continue to be joined by other high-profiling fashion
companies, such as Racing Green, Esprit and Kookai.
While the level of unique and innovative independent retailers such as
Cruise, Ichi-Ni-San and Pollyanna still continues to add that special
flair to the city's retailing hierarchy the question that one must ask
is: is there room for more and undoubtedly, the answer is yes. The
Glaswegians' appetite for quality retailing and fashion appears to be as
elastic as their passion for football.
Glasgow's healthy retail activity has been one of the main driving
forces behind the city's continuing economic success and it is this
unique retailing platform which is now encouraging a new growth sector
for the city.
The exciting changes experienced in Glasgow's retailing hierarchy over
the past five to 10 years are currently having a major ''knock-on''
effect on the city's restaurants and bar profile.
Quality retailing requires quality catering; and until recently this
is one area where Glasgow has lagged behind the UK's other fashion
conscious cities. Some local entrepreneurs such as Colin Barr, Ron
McCulloch and Michael Johnston, through a variety of new food/bar
concepts, have already begun to recognise the importance of quality
food.
Shoppers in Buchanan Street today can encounter nearly every big name
in retailing. What they do not have, however, with the exception of
TGIF, is quality, ground floor restaurants and this is something rather
unusual when compared to the great fashion cities of the Continent such
as Paris, Milan or Barcelona. All these cities within their main quality
shopping boulevards incorporate a substantial number of fashionable
cafes, bars and bistros; after all even the fashion conscious have to
eat and drink.
The Glaswegian need look no further than the council's planning
department and landlords for the reason why. As one planner was recently
quoted: ''Class III restaurant consent does not come with tastebuds,
there is no planning sub division between fastfood and haute cuisine,
and unfortunately if we wish to protect the prime shopping streets then
there can be no exceptions.''
It will be interesting to see if this policy can be maintained over
the next few years, as already ''canny'' retailers are beginning to
recognise the unique benefits of the combination of catering and
retailing.
Princes Square in Glasgow has already highlighted the synergy of
successful catering, excellent service and lifestyle retailing.
Retailers within this development readily acknowledge that it is the
successful combination of fashion and food which results in longer
shopping spend times and ultimately higher levels of sales.
Already retailers in locations such as Bond Street and Regent Street
in London are finding ways around restrictive planning policy by opening
their own in-house restaurants, and following in the earlier footsteps
of companies such as Next and the department stores.
DKNY and Nicole Fahri have embraced this new concept by incorporating
a variety of restaurants and cafe bars within their stores. Nicole's,
which is Nicole Fahri's new restaurant concept, is currently run by
Alison Price Restaurants as a franchise concept, and is aimed at Ladies
who do Lunch.
Retailers install restaurants for a variety of reasons, perhaps their
store is oversized, but also by incorporating restaurants or bar cafes
they can produce income from a space which otherwise would provide
minimal returns.
So what does this mean for Glasgow? Undoubtedly, London's trends do
have an impact on Glasgow, and it is anticipated that a number of
retailers will incorporate bars and cafes within their stores or extend
into adjoining premises. It is likely that retailers will also form
closer relationships with breweries and/or local restaurateurs.
Already, department stores such as House of Fraser in Buchanan Street
have improved their catering offer to meet future competition. It is
rumoured that Harvey Nichols are currently considering several sites
within Glasgow city centre, and that it is their intention to
incorporate within their store a substantial food and catering offer.
Conran's anticipated opening in Glasgow's Merchant City of both a
Conran Department Store, as well as a variety of new and exciting
restaurant concepts, will mark the beginning of a new catering
experience within Glasgow.
Conran's recent success in the London restaurant market through his
opening of a variety of quality restaurants including Quaglinos, the
Chop House and Mezzo has resulted in a substantial ''shake up'' of the
London catering scene. Many smart Glaswegian restaurateurs in the city
are now re-addressing the catering needs of the people on the street,
which can only be good for the city's restaurant profile.
The proposed establishment of companies like Conran and Harvey Nichols
within Glasgow will undoubtedly encourage other catering operators to
follow, and a new gastronomic experience will be ours.

WHEN the Enterprise Zone experiment was initiated by the Government in
1980, the Scottish property market had little idea of what to expect.
Over the past 15 years Scotland has seen the designation of five
Enterprise Zones -- Clydebank, Invergordon, Tayside, Inverclyde and,
most recently, Lanarkshire. Enterprise Zones and the benefits which go
with them are now a familiar aspect of the commercial property market.
The designation of Lanarkshire in 1993 occurred in the wake of the
Ravenscraig closure and, not surprisingly, attracted a good deal of
attention. The various public sector agencies involved in the economic
regeneration of the area have been keen to attract new industry and
commerce and related job creation, and those goals are, of course,
shared by Inverclyde, Scotland's only other current Enterprise Zone.
While in the past there was little overlap between zones because of
differing locational characteristics, the issue of competition between
Lanarkshire and Inverclyde is one which some commentators suggest exists
to their detriment.
In terms of incentives, Lanarkshire and Inverclyde Enterprise Zones
offer identical packages. The key benefits of 100% first-year capital
allowances against UK Corporation or Income Tax, relief from general
rates for the designation period of each zone, and a streamlined
planning process, are common to both. Consequently any business looking
to locate where maximum incentives are available should have Lanarkshire
and Inverclyde high on its agenda.
However, speculative provision of industrial and commercial floorspace
within the Scottish Enterprise Zone market has been focused much more
upon Lanarkshire, and Inverclyde has had difficulty in attracting any
substantial interest since Lanarkshire became a direct competitor.
One fundamental difference goes some way to explaining this.
Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone is perceived to offer a better range of
sites, and by implication development opportunities, all with ready
access to the Central Scotland motorway network. Inverclyde, by
comparison, while accessible from the M8, is at its western periphery.
But more important issues lie behind the preferences of the property
development market. Inverclyde Enterprise Zone, with 11 sites throughout
the district, has undoubtedly benefited from the established industrial
infra-structure in the area.
Major electronics companies were established in the district long
before Enterprise Zone designation, and Inverclyde has been able to
target this rapidly growing industrial sector with some success. One of
the largest industrial units to be built within a Scottish Enterprise
Zone is the 300,000 sq ft computer configuration facility at Faulds
Park, Gourock, occupied by Mimtec to carry out contract work on behalf
of IBM.
This is a good example of an Enterprise Zone being used to stimulate
expansion of the local industrial base, since without the benefits of
Enterprise Zone status, projects of this type would just not happen
within Inverclyde, and might even be lost to Scotland.
None of the Lanarkshire Zone sites have attracted this type of
expansion project. Like Inverclyde, and indeed the other Scottish Zones,
much of the development to date has been speculative, the hope being
that the provision of modern, good quality accommodation will attract
new industry and commerce into the area.
This strategy has been successful, and Tannochside Park in particular
has attracted a number of companies already, which should serve as a
platform for future development. Clearly, there are no prizes for simply
replacing old and obsolete empty buildings with new buildings which lie
vacant. Securing occupiers and creating jobs is the key goal for the
public sector agencies involved in each Enterprise Zone.
Ultimately, occupation space requirements drive the development
markets both within and outwith Enterprise Zones. Historically, some
occupiers have been reluctant to consider Enterprise Zones as suitable
business locations. To some extent this is understandable -- Enterprise
Zones are perceived to be inherently unattractive locations where old
industries have receded, and general stagnation and desolation emerge as
key characteristics.
Lanarkshire has been more successful than any of the other Scottish
Enterprise Zones to date in addressing these perceptions. Substantial
sums have been invested in the provision of infra-structure and the
creation of development sites which, notwithstanding Enterprise Zone
benefits, stand comparison with many of the high quality industrial and
business park sites throughout Scotland's Central Belt.
This success has brought about a subtle change in the development
market. Occupiers are now increasingly alive to the benefits of
Enterprise Zone status, and are electing to have buildings developed in
Lanarkshire to their particular requirements.
Occupier interest in Lanarkshire is certainly stronger now than at any
time in the history of Scottish Enterprise Zones. The perception by
occupiers of Enterprise Zones as desirable locations must be considered
a major step forward. Lanarkshire's success should also be good news for
Inverclyde. The increase in occupier awareness of the benefits which
Enterprise Zones offer should signal a new phase of zone development in
Scotland, with substantially greater job creation prospects than in the
past 15 years.

The aim is to make significant improvements in the performance of the
construction industry and to reduce the cost of projects by at least one
third of current levels while improving standards
Private Finance Initiatives
LAST week's historic opening of the Skye Bridge will be remembered as
one of the earliest and most highly-publicised successes of the
Government's Private Finance Initiative.
As Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth said when opening the link
between the island and the mainland, there are many more opportunities
for privately-financed projects to be undertaken where Government
funding is not forthcoming.
PFI has had its critics, but to take a broader perspective, it is
clear that throughout all the OECD countries, high levels of personal
taxation and swollen state deficits are regarded as anachronistic. In
future, such levels of funding to secure popular infra-structural
developments will simply not be available; instead, privately-financed
projects will be seen as an important means of delivering overall
benefit to the community.
PFI has the wholehearted endorsement of the construction industry in
the United Kingdom, though, I admit, we have found the relatively slow
timescale of its overall take-up frustrating.
It is no secret that the UK construction industry has been hard hit in
recent years. Even after discounting the effects of the recession,
cutbacks in Central Government spending and deferments of proposed
construction projects resulting from local government reorganisation
have severely shaken the industry's self-confidence.
In the absence of other available development projects, therefore, we
salute PFI in the hope that it will lead to significant opportunities in
the near future. On the other hand, I am as aware as anyone in our
industry that many of our difficulties have been exacerbated by the
traditional approach of awarding contracts on the basis of the lowest
price compounded by over-capacity in the industry.
The industry has too often been characterised by a confrontational
approach, with the interface between client, design team and
construction company deteriorating to the point where only the lawyers
can benefit. Price, not value for money, has been the main criterion for
many less enlightened clients.
In a bid to bring an end to this destructive cycle, and to help put
into effect the recommendations of Sir Michael Latham's 1994 report on
the construction industry, Building the Team, there has been
enthusiastic backing for the Construction Round Table (CRT), which
recently brought out a document Commitment to Fair Construction
Contracts.
In addition to Miller Group, the CRT comprises the UK's major
contractors and clients including London Underground, the Highways
Agency, Power Gen, BAA and Marks &amp; Spencer. Significantly, it is the
clients on this group who have realised the need for a more effective
framework to procure their construction projects than has existed
hitherto.
The CRT document incorporates the concept of partnering to produce
value for money benefits for all parties within the construction
industry including its clients, and is one whose importance has finally
been recognised.
The CRT's aim is to make significant improvements in the performance
of the construction industry and to reduce the cost of projects by at
least one third of current levels while improving standards. This is
perhaps an ambitious goal, but I believe it accurately reflects the
extent of the current problems which face us.
Within the construction industry itself, partnering means that
clients, designers and contractors should work together to produce a
'win-win' situation for everyone involved.
Our commitment to partnering means dealing fairly with all parties
with which we contract in an atmosphere of mutual co-operation. It means
also recognising that all the parties engaged in a contract are members
of a team, and that contractual risks should be allocated between the
parties on a rational basis to the one best able to assess, carry and
manage them.
Another aspect of partnering relates to minimising changes to planned
works. In the past, where over-competitiveness could squeeze profit
margins out of the overall contract price, contractors frequently relied
upon changes to the contracted project work to generate profits.
This wasteful practice has placed our industry at a competitive
disadvantage to the rest of the European Community, which is much better
placed to plan ahead, train and invest in research and development.
There is little doubt that partnering and commitment to fair
construction projects can be highly productive. New Edinburgh Limited, a
joint venture company part-owned by Edinburgh District Council and the
Miller Group, is an excellent example of partnering, in this case
between the public and private sector.
Edinburgh Park, a 2.25m sq ft business park, and the adjacent
Hermiston Gait, a 200,000 sq ft retail park, are already home to
Scottish Equitable, John Menzies, British Nuclear, ICL and Sainsbury's
Homebase, and are generating positive returns directly for the council,
as well as creating an entirely new business district for the city.
By working together, in partnership with the council, architects and
other professional advisers, we have successfully developed a project,
on a value-for-money basis, where all its participants are seen to be
winners.
In Glasgow too, our involvement at Pacific Quay, owned by the Glasgow
Development Agency, is shaping up as an example of how, by close and
mutually beneficial co-operation, a private sector developer can act as
enabler to create a strategically important leisure and business-use
facility on previous derelict land close to the city centre.
The lessons, I think are clear: by working together with all our
colleagues in the industry and in harmony with our clients, we can not
only reduce the costs of construction projects by a significant amount
but also improve value-for-money.
The PFI, in conjunction with our industry's new commitment to
partnering, can deliver quality additions to the community store of
quality, high value-added construction projects.

THREE hundred years after being built, one of Scotland's most
important buildings has been rescued from dereliction -- its restoration
and redevelopment symbolising the economic regeneration of an area which
is tackling its problems by capitalising on its opportunities.
The future of Strathleven House, a Category A listed Palladian villa
near Dumbarton, is now assured with the completion of its external
restoration and with its internal shell ready for fit-out and finishing.
It now looks forward to an assured future as a business headquarters.
The exterior restoration was made possible by a partnership forged
between Dunbartonshire Enterprise, part of the Scottish Enterprise
network responsible for economic development, and Historic Scotland.
Both were major funders of the restoration along with Dumbarton District
Council and the Strathclyde European Partnership.
This critical stage was marked this week by an event at which the
project's funders outlined the sustained efforts and collaboration which
have secured the #1m spent to date, with commitments of a further
#500,000 to support the final phase, which will start once an occupier
has been identified.
Strathleven House is not only a building of national architectural
significance, it forms the centrepiece of the Vale of Leven Industrial
Estate. For Dunbartonshire Enterprise and its partners, this event
marked a turning point in re-establishing the estate as a competitive
business location just at the same time as the area is poised to seize
the economic opportunity presented by nearby Loch Lomond.
From its inception in 1991, Dunbartonshire Enterprise recognised the
strategic significance of the Vale of Leven Industrial Estate as a
business location and set about realising its full economic potential.
Polaroid (UK) recently celebrated its 30th year there, and sees a bright
future as one of Scotland's best companies. Allied Distillers' bottling
plant at Vale of Leven is one of the most modern in Europe.
Turnkey (UK) now occupies the former General Time/Westclox plant, and
these large space users, together with a diverse range of small to
medium companies, take up 1,000,000 sq ft.
The estate's strong occupier base, its landscape character, labour
catchment, proximity to Glasgow airport and conurbation, with its
position on the doorstep of Loch Lomond was the starting point. The
challenge was to adjust a historically poor local property market by
demonstrating demand and improving profile.
It was in that context and with strong partnership support that
Dunbartonshire Enterprise decided to invest #250,000 in an emergency
package of works to save and secure Strathleven House which had been
damaged by vandalism, fire, dry rot and years of neglect.
The building is owned by the Scottish Historic Buildings Trust who
buy, repair and find new uses for buildings of architectural importance.
It has championed the project for some years and its efforts have also
been rewarded with a commitment from Historic Scotland for over #1m of
funding.
Dumbarton District Council made a generous contribution relative to
its limited resources for listed buildings, and the restoration has been
strongly supported by Strathclyde European Partnership. All of this took
place under the umbrella of a local public/private joint economic
scheme, the Leven Valley Initiative.
In parallel with its catalytic role in Strathleven House,
Dunbartonshire Enterprise acquired an adjacent 24-acre site and obtained
outline planning consent for approximately 60,000 sq ft of Class 4
space. That site has since been prepared for development through
enhancement of the historic estate landscape, preliminary works to a
former stable block structure and creation of a water feature based on
the duck flight.
With the external restoration of Strathleven House the site is of the
highest quality and will be promoted for inward investment or indigenous
expansion. Strathleven House will be marketed similarly, both on a
stand-alone basis and together with the adjacent development site.
In selecting a new occupier for the house, DE and SHBT have the shared
objective of maximising economic impact. Although a number of
development options exist, it is probably that the final phase will take
place with the prior identification of a user which can support an
acquisition cost estimated at #750,000. Uses are likely to be
office-orientated, with obvious scope for headquarters, R&amp;D or training
facilities.
On the Vale of Leven Estate the challenge of stimulating a local
property market has been fulfilled by provision of two advance factory
units of around 25,000 sq ft. These, and a similar existing unit built
by the SDA, have been let or sold on terms which represent benchmark
delays locally. Businesses attracted to the estate in recent times
include Ashton Corrugated, Methode Electronics and Drampac.
With this confidence, and over 50 acres of good quality development
land, Dunbartonshire Enterprise in partnership with Scottish Enterprise
is now opening exploratory dialogues with potential private sector
development partners with a view to completing the estate's development.
Such development is likely to be on a pre-let or sale basis, and the
overall package will include infrastructure improvements and existing
occupiers will be fully involved in the process.
The plans for the estate compliment DE's wider strategy in the area.
The south western end of Loch Lomond is only two miles away and it's
here, at Balloch, that Dunbartonshire Enterprise recently announced its
proposal to work with the private sector and other public sector
partners to bring about Scotland's most exciting new tourism
development. That development, centred on the site known as Drumkinnon
Bay, has as its aim the establishment of Loch Lomond as a must-see
destination.
The overall concept embraces Balloch Castle Country Park, which will
be linked to the site by a pedestrian footbridge. The Loch Lomond
project will realise a vision set out in the Clyde Valley Regional Plan
in 1946 which said: ''Here should be the great reception point for
tourists; an area where they should be accommodated and introduced to
the attractions of the North.''
Although tourism is its main impetus, the Loch Lomond Project will
greatly enhance the attractions of the wider area as a place to live,
work and do business, with the Loch Lomond Golf Club next year hosting
the Loch Lomond World Invitational event, the area's brand image will be
promoted worldwide.
''With success stories like Polaroid and projects like Strathleven
House, the area can again look forward to being a competitive place for
business locations.
History of the house
Strathleven House was build around 1690 for William, Lord Cochrane,
and is thought to have been designed by James Smith. As well as its
significant influence on Scottish architecture and urban development,
the house has a colourful history.
Its owners included James Ewing, a former Lord Provost of Glasgow, MP
and West India merchant, who started the Necropolis project and was
Chairman of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce in 1818-19.
The architect, James Smith, became a Burgess of the City of Edinburgh
and Overseer of the Royal Works, represented Forres in the Scottish
Parliament of 1685-86 and had 32 children.
The interior woodwork, presently being restored off-site, is by
William Morgan, who worked on Wren's City churches and, in Scotland, on
Holyrood Chapel, Hamilton Palace and Dalkeith Palace.
In 1947 the house and its estate were purchased by the Board of Trade
as part of its efforts to promote new industry in the regions.
Under the management of the Scottish Industrial Estates Corporation
and then the SDA, the estate proved a successful location for large
scale inward investors including Burroughs, General Time and Polaroid.

WITH Ibrox, which had held 42,523 supporters, empty and almost silent,
it was time for reflection on two matches which have severely damaged
Rangers stock in Europe.
They still have two more to play in Group C of the Champions' League,
against Steaua Bucharest and Borussia Dortmund, but it is extremely
unlikely the Scottish champions will qualify for the quarter-final
stages.
Rangers manager Walter Smith forced a smile before he, too, left the
ground, and although in response to the suggestion that his team were
now out of contention in their group, he said: ''You never know, we'll
see.''
There was a lack of conviction.
The Juventus manager Marcello Lippi, was more forthright. ''Yes,'' he
replied when asked if he felt Rangers were now out of the running.
Lippi, however, was unwilling to say it had been easy for his Italian
champions over the last fortnight, but the 4-1 and 4-0 scorelines say it
all in any case.
''Juventus played the real game,'' he added, ''and everything went
well for us tonight. We played a complete game.
''Rangers played a completely different game here than in Turin where
they tried to defend, attacking only after they were two goals behind.
This time they tried to attack from the beginning, but Juventus
controlled the whole match.''
Smith agreed the last two weeks have been something of a
''nightmare,'' but by way of explanation, the manager added: ''It has
been that -- not just in losing goals, but also in the situation in
which we found ourselves when trying to select a team.
''I felt for the first hour we were always in it, but the manner in
which we lost the first two goals was disappointing.''
The loss of the third and fourth goals late in the match Smith put
down fatigue among his players.
''I always expected that to happen in the later stages because four or
five of my players were not fully match fit,'' he said.
Steven Wright was taken off in the first half and the extent of his
knee injury will not be known until sometime today and the keeper, Andy
Goram, who did not reappear after the interval, will be idle for the
next couple of weeks because of a hip injury.
Asked if these two thrashings by Juventus would force him into an
overhaul of his side, Smith bristled slightly and said: ''I can't have a
drastic overhaul of what I don't have. What you saw on the pitch was
what I had to work with.
''If I could just get a team on the pitch...''
Smith left the remainder unsaid, but the truth is Juventus would
probably still have won even if Rangers had been at full strength.
The Italians, simply, are better.
* RANGERS are quoted at 20-1 to qualify for the European Cup
quarter-finals by William Hill, who rate them at 500-1 to win it.
Juventus are 13-8 favourites while champions Ajax are 15-8, Real Madrid
11-2 and Borussia Dortmund 10-1.

Steaua Bucharest 0, Borussia Dortmund 0
BORUSSIA Dortmund held former European champions Steaua Bucharest to a
draw in a in Romania last night and boosted their chances of reaching
the quarter-final stages.
The Germans defended with great determination, especially in the
second half, to stay second in the group behind Juventus, who have
maximum 12 points from their four Champions' League games.
With two rounds of group matches to come, Dortmund have five points,
one more than 1986 European champions Steaua.
In the first half Steaua dominated the game and had several good
opportunities to score as they pressed forward. Defender Anton Dobos
twice headed over the bar, and striker Marius Lacatus and midfield
player Adrian Ilie looked on as good efforts just missed the target.
Czech midfielder Patrik Berger passed up Dortmund's best chance,
missing from close range in the second half. Michael Zorc also volleyed
wide from close range after an excellent pass from the best man of the
field, Andreas Moeller.
Steaua trainer Dumitru Dumitriu said later: ''We lost the chance to
win in the first half when our players missed far too many good
opportunities.''
But Dortmund manager Ottmar Hitzfeld was pleased with the result,
saying: ''Steaua dominated play in the first half but we got slowly into
the game and were lucky to end with a goalless draw.''
Moeller said: ''We can play much better and we must win the home game
against Rangers (on December 6) to make sure we get to the
quarter-finals.''

Building maintenance.
PROPERTY maintenance for most commercial and industrial organisations
has been a taboo subject throughout the recession. Maintenance has been
carried out only when a ''critical'' state of disrepair has arisen. The
luxury of making improvements such as refurbishing the staff canteen or
installing heaters in the warehouse has remained part of long term
improvement plans.
The norm in most organisations with a property maintenance department
is for informal maintenance to be carried out on an ad hoc basis by a
local builder. The builder will be asked to attend to a group of
maintenance defects at the request of the in-house manager. Often,
quotations will be obtained initially but the work is often delayed.
As a result, the decision for the work to proceed is often made once a
defect such as a roof leak becomes critical. Once on site, the builder
is asked to attend to other matters requiring attention. This is a
sporadic, unplanned maintenance approach, and consequently budgeting is
difficult, if not impossible, with expenditure usually greater than
anticipated.
The age and condition of the building may not be known, the reason for
the need for the repair is not analysed, and therefore a strategy for
future maintenance cannot be mapped out.
Often the property manager holds some of this information in his head,
and good builders can give helpful opinions and advice. However, with
personnel changes and with larger holdings of property, this information
can be lost. In the worst scenario, repairs continue because renewal is
too expensive and it is not budgeted for. The inevitable is being
postponed while repair costs escalate.
Setting up a proper maintenance programme is highly desirable. From a
detailed initial inspection of the complete property portfolio, data is
collected and logged to show the necessary repairs, cost, priority and
when it should be undertaken. Other pertinent information is also logged
to help the planning process. Items are then scheduled in priority, and
may be cross checked from one property to another to form the
maintenance plan.
There are five types of planned preventive and corrective maintenance
work to be considered, which are not always mutually exclusive, and
which together make up the basis of the maintenance plan.
* Cyclical or recurring maintenance: ie clearing out gutters and
redecoration.
* Immediate maintenance: apparent defects requiring repair in the
short term.
* Foreseeable maintenance: repairs identified as being necessary in
the medium and long term.
* Perceptive maintenance: delay of maintenance to building elements
until other planned repairs which would cause damage or disturbance are
complete.
* Recommend improvements: recommendations of when improvement and
refurbishments would be be carried out based on the client's initial
brief and long-term proposals for the property.
The management strategy in implementing the maintenance plan is
determined from the client's available funds. For example, if funds are
tight, high priority work can be planned for the first year while
non-urgent work can be deferred to the next.
Persistent neglect of a low priority item can make it a high priority.
The plan and the management process will accommodate this through
periodic inspection and update of the plan.
Where maintenance has been neglected, initial costs can be excessive.
However they do normalise over time, and the programme can be adjusted
to provide a uniform level of annual expenditure. This usually
highlights to the client the importance of planning and budgeting.
A formal maintenance plan which is implemented properly and managed by
a property professional will prevent sporadic and unexpected expenditure
and distribute work uniformly within the maintenance plan. It will limit
expensive ad hoc emergency repairs, and provide management with enough
data to form a strategic business plan.
The method of procurement can vary and the choice depends mainly on
the size and geographic spread of the portfolio as well as the degree of
management required.
Often the ''preferred'' local builder can compete in tenders for
suitable contracts, maintaining relationships established by previous
informal maintenance procedures.
Actual monetary savings in the long term are normally significant, but
are very difficult to calculate and do vary depending on the portfolio
size and geographic location. Equally as important, a comprehensive
building strategy is acquired and sound business acumen dictates the
benefits.

Rangers...0, Juventus...4
THE only consolation is that the suffering will soon be over. There
was that growing reality to cling to at the end of another hard night
for Scottish football in the big boys' playground.
By the time the lights were going out around Ibrox, the players who
live there were left looking more than a little beaten up. If nothing
else, Juventus have shown twice in a fortnight exactly how far Rangers
are still behind the real players.
The Italian champions have taken eight goals off Rangers for the loss
of only one -- in old-style European Cup football that would constitute
an 8-1 aggregate win -- and the premier-division side find themselves
wandering aimlessly, forlorn even, around the basement of Group C in the
Champions' League with a single point to their credit.
Injuries and suspensions have played a part in Rangers' troubles, but
the poverty of their play in Europe so far this season has been a
consequence of more serious problems. They may be the champions of
Scotland, and they are expected to collect their eighth successive
championship, but at the top level they are impotent.
Rangers were unable to play with enough flair or invention and could
not produce anything remotely like a decent passing game. Without a
fluent, clever passing style it is virtually impossible to succeed in
Europe. Certainly if you give the ball away too easily, you also concede
the advantage.
The Italians, who had been cruising at 2-0, scored two more goals in
the last couple of minutes, strikes which merely wiped away memories of
two earlier scoring opportunities which Walter Smith's side squandered.
Another serious failing. If teams like Rangers can't make the most of
the few chances which come their way in Europe, then they will always be
pursued by defeat and doubt.
Although the scoreless match between Steaua Bucharest (four points)
and Borussia Dortmund (five) in Romania leaves Rangers with a faint
hope, they simply don't look capable of beating Steaua at Ibrox and then
Dortmund in Germany. Even if they did, they would then have to hope
Juventus win their second games against each of the other clubs, but the
Italians, with 12 points from their four matches so far, would be
entitled to ease off slightly with their quarter-final place assured.
Gary Bollan was sighted for the first time this season when Rangers
emerged from the tunnel and the former Dundee United player was one of
five changes from the team which had been thrashed in Turin two weeks
ago. Paul Gascoigne, who again was anonymous, Charlie Miller, Ian
Ferguson, and John Brown, also started last night's match.
Juventus also made changes, with Gianluca Vialli, Gianluca Pessotto,
Alessio Tacchinardi, and Massimo Carrera on from the start.
When they scored after only 16 minutes there was a sense of deja vu
because Juventus scored their first goal in the Stadio Delle Alpi two
weeks ago after only 15 minutes, and went on to put the ball in Rangers
net three more times. It happened again as Rangers were reminded that
perspiration without inspiration would not stop Juventus for the entire
match.
Despite the Ibrox side's determined start, the first player booked was
Italian. Oleg Salenko was fouled by Moreno Torricelli and he was shown
the yellow card for the second time in this qualifying series which
means he will miss Juventus's next match.
However, in 64 minutes the fullback scored a splendid goal, his team's
second, and from then on it was all too much for Rangers.
Perhaps it would have been different if a Richard Gough header had not
been touched on to his right-hand post by Angelo Peruzzi or if Charlie
Miller had managed to score when John Brown's sweet pass put him clear
inside the box.
While Rangers were not short on spirit, they failed miserably to set
up a steady supply line to Salenko and Miller. Quality passes were not a
problem for Juventus as Angelo Di Livio demonstrated with a delivery
from the right into the middle of Rangers' box where Petric rose to try
to clear.
Unfortunately, he didn't fulfil his intention and missed the ball
completely. Alassandro Del Piero, who was only six yards from goal,
might have been astonished to find the ball at his feet, but he was calm
enough to make the most of his gift.
The stretcherbearers were summoned to remove Stephen Wright in 24
minutes after he had been hurt while trying to deal with Vialli and
Petric moved over to cover at right full back. Ian Durrant was released
from the dugout into midfield.
When Rangers returned after the break, it was without Goram, who
appeared to have pulled a muscle while clearing a pass-back midway in
the first half. Billy Thomson stepped in and had to make a good save
from Angelo Di Livio.
Rangers then surged forward and hit both of Peruzzi's posts inside a
minute. First, Gough's header from Ian Ferguson's corner was touched by
the keeper and on to his right-hand post and then from Paul Gascoigne's
corner, a Ferguson header hit the base of the opposite post.
However, the Turkish referee, Ahmet Cakar, awarded Juventus a foul
saying Ferguson had used a hand. The official was subjected to loud
abuse a little later when he refused Rangers a penalty after Salenko,
who had been tackled by Torricelli, went down inside the box rather too
elaborately.
Torricelli, with the poise of a thoroughbred finisher, ran on to a
wonderful Vialli pass to score his goal and silence the Ibrox support,
who again were stirred by some determined play.
Both sides made changes -- McCoist took over from Miller in 69 minutes
-- but it was the Juventus replacements who made their marks. Fabrizio
Ravanelli, on for Vialli in 69 minutes, scored the third goal in 88
minutes, and Giancarlo Marocchi, who took over from Alessio Tacchinardi,
scored a splendid fourth from long range.
RANGERS -- Goram, Wright, Bollan, Gough, Brown, Petric, Ferguson,
Gascoigne, Miller, Salenko, McCall. Substitues -- Durrant, McCoist,
Murray, Reid, Thomson.
JUVENTUS -- Peruzzi, Torricelli, Pessotto, Carrera, Porrini, Sousa, Di
Livio, Tacchinardi, Vialli, Del Piero, Conte. Substitutes -- Ferrara,
Marocchi, Padovano, Ravanelli, Rampulla.
Referee -- A Cakar (Turkey).

ONE word occurs over and over again in any discussion about property
markets -- and that is confidence. Whichever particular aspect of the
hotel market is being examined, the state of the confidence factor keeps
recurring.
The first rung of the hotel market is fuelled by house sales, and the
lack of confidence in the English house market has severely restricted
the number of buyers from south of the border competing for the smaller
hotels and public houses.
There is a seemingly endless war of words among players in the housing
market, with some building societies finding it difficult to remark upon
anything other than malaise and lack of activity.
Diametrically opposed to this are the views expressed by major house
agents, especially those in central Scotland, which produce reams of
evidence to show strong demand for houses, particularly in Edinburgh and
Glasgow.
Stability in the house market is essential. Invariably, those who
enter the hotel market raise a substantial proportion of the price from
the equity in their house, and if they make a success of their first
venture in a hotel or pub, then they frequently have an appetite for a
more ambitious and more complicated business. They move upmarket into
larger premises, and reap even more of the benefits associated with the
independence, profitability and satisfaction of running their own
business.
At any time this need for confidence is a fragile commodity, but
during the past few months a number of extremely promising signs have
suggested that confidence has returned, showing itself, for example, in
the successful imposition of closing dates for the sale of hotels. The
Kirklee Hotel, in the West End of Glasgow, attracted such strong demand
from both local and outside interest that the only way to separate
offers was to impose a closing date, and a very satisfactory deal was
struck.
Improved trading performance is stimulating confidence in the hotel
property market. In general, the leisure and hospitality trades have
enjoyed a refreshingly busy summer season, no doubt stimulated by good
weather and the publicity from events such as the Tall Ships Race for
Edinbugh, Braveheart for Stirling, and Rob Roy for the Central
Highlands. A wide range of hotels throughout Scotland are saying trade
has improved this year.
The recognised tourist areas, such as Loch Ness, Royal Deeside and
Loch Lomond, continue to attract purchasers for hotel and leisure
properties, both home grown and from abroad. Right across the price and
style ranges there has been good demand, shown in the successful sale of
the Clansman Hotel on Loch Ness, the Rowardennan Hotel on Loch Lomond,
and the Callater Lodge in Braemar.
Beyond the owner-occupied sector of the hotel market there has been
considerable activity amongst the corporate players. Regal Hotels plc
bought the Queensferry Lodge Hotel in North Queensferry for #3.8m,
believed to be the largest sale of a hotel in private ownership in
Scotland.
There appears to be reasonable demand right across the market. One or
two recent deals illustrate this, such as the sale of the Kinlochbervie
and Kintail Lodge Hotels in the wilds of the West Highlands, to their
more ''urban cousins'' such as Eden House at Cupar, or the Open Arms in
East Lothian.
Regardless of size, the most conspicuous thread running through all
these transactions is a combination of quality and good value. When both
characteristics have featured, there has been strong demand, reflecting
both confidence from the purchasers, and a determination by vendors to
complete a deal.
Financial support for the hotel market had been fairly thin until
recently. This does not appear to be a particularly significant problem
any longer, although lending sources are leaning much more heavily on
the calibre of the applicant and the existing trading performance of the
business than in the less controlled years of the late 1980s.
The Scottish hospitality and hotel market did not suffer from the
uncontrolled inflation which seriously affected the South-east of
England at the height of the property boom. Demand was far more
controlled and related to trading performance, and although there has
been a measurable fall in values, these are nothing like as severe as
those experienced south of the border.
The hospitality industry -- in its widest possible context -- benefits
from a relatively stable tourist and corporate market, and this has led
to predictable demand from which confidence in the market will grow.
As always, the market places great emphasis on quality and value for
money. Properties meeting these criteria are in demand from both private
and corporate buyers, and deals are being negotiated in all sectors of
the market.

IF someone had asked me 10 years ago to explain the concept of a hot
desk then my answer would either have been that it was either stolen
property or that their job was in some equatorial climate.
Nowadays the concept of a hot desk means something entirely different
and shows that the occupation of property is a dynamic and constantly
evolving process. Not only does this apply to the occupation of property
but also to building specification.
Office technology continues to change rapidly, with occupiers having
an increasing awareness of environmental issues. This means that any new
office building must be cost-effective, economical to occupy and
flexible enough to allow the building to change with the differing
business needs of the end users.
The British Council for Offices recently produced an outline
specification for the development of open offices and this provides
general guidelines for speculative office development.
At the present time, developers must look beyond the immediate needs
of the occupier and focus on the requirements of the funding
institutions, as they remain by far the most influential and important
sales point for completed buildings. This has, it has been argued, led
to an increase in office specification beyond that which is functionally
required.
In undertaking any development, the majority of the developer's profit
is realised in the sale of the completed and fully let development to an
institution. Many developers view the tenant's role in the process as a
means to an end whereby the building, once occupied, can be sold and
their profit realised.
In many instances, the requirements of the occupier are generally
ignored as the developer provides a building which will meet the funding
institutions' specification rather than providing a functional and
efficient working environment for the occupier.
In many instances, air-conditioning or mechanical ventilation is not
deemed by the occupier to be an essential item within the building.
Under service charge provisions, the tenant is responsible for paying
the running costs of these systems which have, in the past, proved
expensive.
The last 15 years have seen a considerable revolution in information
technology and building design has been amended to take into account
these changes. For example, floors have evolved from simply carpet
covered concrete structures to floors with three-compartment under floor
trunking which then became full raised access systems. Now there is a
flat wiring system which does away with the need to provide an
under-floor void.
Whilst developers have been able to take advantage of these changes to
provide better specified buildings with sophisticated systems, the
tenants, who signed 25-year leases in the early 1980s, still have 10
years to go until the 25-year term expires. This has resulted in many
instances in tenants having to spend considerable sums of money in
trying to adapt and upgrade older style buildings to accommodate their
new information technology systems.
The 25-year lease is an extremely emotive topic and one which is
meeting increased resistance from tenants as a result of their increased
bargaining position and a change in the market.
It was a landlords' market in the 1980s, with 25-year leases being the
accepted norm. With the service industry expanding rapidly, there was
unprecedented demand for office space, with tenants competing against
each other for the same property. Developers and institutions were in a
position to be able to insist that tenants signed up on 25-year leases.
The situation has now changed, and one of the most prominent features
of the market is the length of lease which tenants are prepared to
accept. Tenants frequently argue that they do not put forward more than
a three-year business plan and therefore do not see why they should have
to commit their company to a 25-year lease on premises which may not be
suitable for their long-term needs.
Information technology continues to have a major implication on the
way office buildings function and the specification required.
Tele-working, ''hot- desking'' and wireless/cable-free computer
terminals will have an effect on the occupational density of buildings
as well as the need for certain standard features such as full
accessible raised floors.
It is particularly those buildings which have fallen out of favour,
for example, Georgian townhouses or 1960s buildings, which may benefit
from this technology change, once more bringing them into functional
use.

IN terms of devolution and the Edinburgh office market, the first time
around was in 1707 when the Scottish Parliament devolved to London. Some
would say it's been downhill all the way since then, but who am I to
comment.
You can prove anything with statistics. One way is to put every square
foot of office space in Edinburgh into one bucket regardless of quality
and you come up with a total of 15m sq ft gross in 1980, rising to
around 18m sq ft today. This compares broadly with 20m sq ft in Glasgow,
18.3m sq ft in Birmingham, and 18.7m sq ft in Manchester today.
Historically, occupiers were concentrated in the Georgian New Town.
Gradually in the sixties and seventies the public sector and others
established space away from the centre on a sporadic basis in a variety
of locations.
Subsequently, devolution became an issue, with a referendum and
resultant expectations sparking development around 1980 creating an
over-supply which took several years to soak up.
By 1988, big bang had occurred and triggered a huge growth in
financial services, creating major occupational issues in Edinburgh.
Meanwhile, the New Town market took off, expanding west and north whilst
retaining institutional and banking HQs at its core.
Between 1988 and 1995 the New Town market overheated, creating
problems which still exist, and the drive for new, large top quality
space led to a polarisation of relocation, firstly to the west of
Edinburgh, secondly to the south-west end of the New Town, and thirdly
the current major move by the public sector to Leith.
And here we are again, 15 years later, with devolution again a live
issue.
Grouping sectors by date, firstly the public sector grew from 2.58m sq
ft in 1980 rising to 3.37m sq ft today.
Secondly the professional sector. A major jump from 550,000 sq ft in
1980 to 1.26m sq ft in 1988 rising marginally to 1.47m sq ft today.
Next, financial services. A dramatic rise throughout the period. One
million square feet in 1980 rising to 1.97m sq ft in 1988 and 2.8m sq ft
today with a further increase to 3.65m sq ft in 1997.
In terms of local trends, firstly the professional sector. The New
Town is the traditional heart. By 1980 the professional sector had
generally consolidated to the western end of the New Town and by 1988
had begun to spread north-east, further west of Charlotte Square, and
south to Rutland Square.
By 1995 we have definite proof that professional occupiers will cross
Princes Street to Saltire Court, and by 1997 we will have the
establishment of the new Exchange District. In summary, a positive
expansion over the 15-year period, but conservative in terms of location
until recently. But a logical extension of the central business district
and a real move from Georgian buildings to top quality workspace.
The public sector presents a very different picture. Prior to 1980,
the public sector had established core buildings in the central area,
but also in addition a number of large buildings in other parts of the
city.
By 1988 there was additional uptake of various empty buildings
developed speculatively for devolution, and the first speculative
development to the west of the city had taken place at South Gyle. Three
buildings of 91,000 sq ft subsequently let to three Government
departments. Better buildings and in an emerging business park location.
And today, the new Scottish Office at Victoria Quay, Leith. A green
and high quality, low energy building -- 303,000 sq ft plus 650 cars on
the banks of the Forth estuary.
Lastly, the financial services sector. Up to 1980 this sector had long
established headquarters in the east end of the New Town together with
steady acquisition of additional buildings in the same area, with one or
two exceptions, notably Scottish Widows, who in 1973 had started
construction of their pioneering development of 200,000 sq ft at
Dalkeith Road.
By 1988 owner occupiers in the financial sector were concerned at the
ratcheting impact of rental growth on the central area and the effects
of big bang. They started looking to establish large new complexes. At
the same time the local authority began to see the need for a new
business district in town plus a top quality business park out of town.
Hence, by 1995 we see the main players building for the next century,
and this in turn encouraging top quality speculative development
alongside.
In 1980 the Bank of Scotland occupied 333,000 sq ft of offices in 14
locations, including 145,000 sq ft out at South Gyle. Today the bank
occupies 578,000 sq ft in 24 locations and the South Gyle facility has
grown to 309,000 sq ft.
In 1980 the Royal Bank of Scotland occupied 286,000 sq ft in six
buildings. By 1988 they faced a real need to expand so they purchased 18
acres at South Gyle and completed Drummond House in 1992, 203,000 sq ft
plus 700 cars. A top quality, open plan building with a 6ft access
floor, floor-wired, opening windows and comfort cooling. They have
planning permission to double the size of the building.
Having said all that, the opportunity arose for the Royal Bank to buy
the 70,000 sq ft LES building earlier this year right slap bang in the
middle of the New Town.
Round the corner from that building, Scottish Equitable have had their
headquarters for 150 years. In 1988 they started looking for an
additional large site. They looked at central Edinburgh, Livingston and
Fife, but in 1992 they purchased 20 acres at Edinburgh Park, and are
building 270,000 sq ft plus 1000 cars with room for considerable
expansion.
The philosophy is, space and efficiency, natural light plus one car
space and a view of green fields for every employee in a sealed, fully
air-conditioned building.
In 1980 Standard Life occupied 230,000 sq ft in nine locations, by
1988 436,000 sq ft in 20 locations and today 765,000 sq ft in 31
locations.
In 1991 they completed their Tanfield development of 185,000 sq ft
north of the city centre, but still not enough space. Therefore, as part
of the new Exchange District, they are now building a further 266,000 sq
ft plus 103 car spaces for occupation in late 1996.
To return to Scottish Widows, they currently occupy 450,000 sq ft in
seven locations and are also now developing a further 357,000 sq ft at
Port Hamilton, again as part of their new Exchange District.
So what of the future? Out of town, there's Edinburgh Park with 130
acres adjacent to the 300,000 sq ft Gyle Shopping Centre, and in town,
the new Exchange District has one million square feet, the biggest
development in Edinburgh since the construction of the New Town. Saltire
Court, the pioneer building, 196,000 sq ft completed in 1991 and
purchased as a trophy investment in 1993 by the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority. In addition, Rutland Court home to fund managers Baillie
Gifford, 38,000 sq ft completed in 1991 and purchased in 1994 by MPI.
The Exchange will include both these developments, together with
Scottish Widows, Standard Life and the Conference Centre.
It also includes the Exchange Plaza development, a series of top
quality buildings now under construction giving the best space in town.
The first phase of 96,000 sq ft, No 1 Exchange Plaza is due for
completion and will be available for occupation in late 1996.
There is one other important issue. Sustaining the historic core of
the New Town.
That is of equal importance. All sectors continue to maintain a strong
presence in the New Town despite expansion to new locations. It is the
heart of the city. The traditional office core will be retained but on a
reduced geographical basis. There will not be a huge number of buildings
off-loaded by the financial sector and Charlotte Square will regain its
rightful place within a specific sector of the market.

Sir Henry Alan Walter Richard Percy, (14th Bt), 11th Duke of
Northumberland; born July 1, 1953, died October 30, 1995.
THE 11th Duke of Northumber-
land, who died on Monday at Syon House aged 42, was the eldest son of
the 10th Duke of Northumberland and his duchess, Lady Elizabeth Montagu
Douglas Scott, daughter of the 9th Duke of Buccleuch. He was a godson of
the Queen.
Belonging to one of Britain's most blue-blooded families, he was
directly related to six other dukedoms. His maternal grandmother was a
daughter of the 7th Duke of Richmond and Gordon. His maternal
great-grandmother was the daughter of the 8th Duke of Argyll; Lady
Elizabeth Percy, his aunt, was married to the 14th Duke of Hamilton &amp;
Brandon; Lady Diana Percy was married to the 6th Duke of Sutherland. His
mother's cousin was married to the 7th Duke of Portland.
The Percy family have been an influential and turbulent dynasty in
England ever since their founder, William de Percy, arrived from
Normandy with William the Conqueror in 1066 for the Battle of Hastings.
Richard de Percy was one of the chief nobles to force King John to sign
the Magna Carta in 1215, and Henry de Percy assisted Edward I of England
in his attempts to subjugate Scotland. In return for his support, Henry
was granted Robert the Bruce's forfeited titles and lands in the north
of England.
Harry ''Hotspur'' Percy, the soldier-statesman, inspired the excitable
character featured in William Shakespeare's Henry IV. The 6th Earl of
Northumberland was the lover of Anne Boleyn; the 8th Earl was a
supporter of Mary Queen of Scots.
Educated at Eton, and Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied history,
Harry Northumberland inherited the great estates of Alnwick Castle,
Northumberland, and Syon House in Middlesex, at the age of 35. The
fortune, although entailed for future generations, was considerable.
Estimated at over #200m in total, assets include Tottenham football
ground. At Syon, the walls are hung with a vast collection of old
masters, numbering among them Titians, Tintorettos and Van Dycks.
From an early age he had been fascinated by the cinema and
film-making. This led him to found a film company, Hotspur Productions,
investing his own money into its first production Lost in Africa, shot
in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Botswana, about a tourist party kidnapped by
ivory poachers. He was a regular guest at film premieres, and only last
week attended the opening of Haunted in London's Leicester Square.
Despite having been in ill-health for most of his adult life (he
suffered from ME, a renal illness, and depression), he took the
responsibilities of his title and inheritance very seriously, and was
deeply concerned for the welfare of all those who depended upon him.
A particular interest was the preservation of Britain's national
heritage, as evidenced by the care and attention he lavished upon his
own two great stately homes, notably Syon which has become one of
London's major tourist attractions.
He did not marry, but for a time his name was romantically linked with
a number of glamorous companions, including Barbara Carrera, the
Nicaraguan-born actress and former 007 girl. Athough shy by nature, his
shrewd intelligence, breadth of interests, and simple, unaffected charm
made him a much-loved figure by those who knew him well.
The dukedom now passes to his younger brother Lord Ralph Percy, a land
agent, who is married to Jane Richard, daughter of John Richard, former
chairman of the Scottish Stock Exchange, and Angela, Lady Buchan
Hepburn. They have two sons and two daughters.

Kenneth Dadzie, Ghanaian diplomat, born September 10, 1930, died
October 25, 1995.
KENNETH Dadzie, Ghana's High Commissioner in London and head from 1986
to 1994 of the Geneva-based United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (Unctad), has died in London from a heart attack. He was
notable for being the first African to hold a series of high offices in
social and economic fields within the United Nations.
Educated at Achimota College in the then Gold Goast, and Queen's
College, Cambridge -- where he took a degree in economics in 1952 --
Dadzie was known as a moderate but committed man with a refreshing
breadth of vision. He argued for the liberalisation of trade and
believed in open markets and progressive policies in the private sector.
Unctad, created in 1964 as an organ of the UN General Assembly, is the
main forum for debate between industrial and developing nations on
commodities, trade, debt, shipping, and economic development. But
Dadzie's years in the organisation were marked by a gradual erosion of
his powers as Unctad's role itself was diluted.
In earlier international roles, Dadzie had served as his country's
representative to the Security Council from 1960 to 1963, going on to be
Ghana's permanent representative at the UN office in Geneva while
serving as ambassador to Austria and Switzerland.
Continuing his association with the UN, he worked on decolonisation
issues with the Organisation of African Unity, and in 1978 became the
first director-general for Development and International Economic
Co-operation. When he was removed from this position by Perez de Cuellar
in 1983, African ambassadors to the UN complained about racial
discrimination and decided to monitor their countries' representation in
the secretariat.
Dadzie, who served more than eight years as Unctad secretary-general,
had returned to London to serve as Ghana's High Commissioner, a post he
had previously held. After a long-standing vacancy in the top Unctad
job, he was finally succeeded last month by Rubens Ricupero, a former
Brazilian finance minister.

Terry Southern, writer, born May 1, 1921, died October 30, 1995.
BEST known for his screenplays, which included Dr Strangelove or How I
learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, Terry Southern, was also a
gifted satirical novelist.
He was the author of Candy and The Magic Christian, a living legend to
his fans, and possibly the finest American practitioner of the art of
satire since Nathaniel West. He was said to be a shy, reserved man on
first acquaintance, but once he knew people his wit and generosity were
both expansive and he had a gift for mimicry to match that of Peter
Sellers.
Born in Alvarado, Texas, he served with the US army in Europe during
the Second World War, and, after graduating in English from Northwestern
University in 1948, went to the Sorbonne for four years.
In 1958 he published Flash and Filigree, and the follow-up, The Magic
Christian, about a millionaire who tests the cupidity of his fellow men
through a series of hoaxes, appeared the following year, establishing
his reputation.
The success of Strangelove led to a career writing film scripts --
Easy Rider, The Magic Christian, End of the Road, Barbarella, and The
Loved One among them, and he worked with directors as diverse as Tony
Richardson, Roger Vadim, Norman Jewison, and Otto Preminger. During the
seventies his career seems to have faltered, there were rumours of drug
and alcohol abuse, and although he continued to write scripts they were
not produced.
He worked in television, notably during the 1981/82 season of Saturday
Night Live, and in 1988 wrote The Telephone which starred Whoopi
Goldberg. His semi-autobiographical book, Texas Summer, published in
1992, occupied him for several years, and he also taught graduate
seminars at Columbia in screenwriting while living in East Canaan,
Connecticut.
He is survived by his second wife Carol, their son, and his longtime
companion Gail Gerber.

Brian Joseph Lenihan, TD, former deputy prime minister of Ireland,
born November 17, 1930, died November 1, 1995.
IN the Irish Republic no Hallowe'en had ever been so ripe for mischief
as that last October day five years ago when one of the country's most
durable and convivial politicians was forced to resign for protecting
his ruthless leader not too little but too much.
Now, still in the shadow of that troublesome feast, Brian Lenihan has
died, and Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail old guard looks both depleted
and crushed. Lenihan had represented the Dublin West constituency in the
Dail for the past 18 years. His sister, Mary O'Rourke is deputy leader
of Fianna Fail.
His fall from political grace in 1990, and his subsequent defeat in
the presidential election some days later, marked the beginning of the
end for Haughey's unscrupulous hold on power. The crisis for Lenihan had
been caused by his own conflicting statements on an issue gleefully
labelled Dublingate.
The central allegation was that in 1982 -- at a time of turmoil in
Garret FitzGerald's coalition government -- Lenihan had made a phone
call to the then president urging him to instal Haughey, the Opposition
leader, as premier without the necessity of a general election.
But in 1990, when asked about the incident on television, Lenihan
denied exerting any pressure by phone. Later, in that run-up to
Hallowe'en, he let slip, in a taped interview with a research student,
that he had indeed employed such tactics.
So, which story was true? A man of natural wit and charm, Lenihan
played for ambiguity, but in order to survive a no confidence vote in
the Dail, Prime Minister Haughey sacked his ''old friend'', then backed
him for the presidency in a charade of such cynicism it ridiculed any
notion of integrity.
Thus, with Mary Robinson's subsequent victory as head state, Lenihan
was doubly humiliated, but he was never the real villain of the piece.
The man who had been foreign minister three times and had held numerous
Cabinet posts over 40 years, was, in fact, regardedwith much affection
for his generosity of spirit, astute politicking on behalf of ordinary
folk, and the zealot's relish he brought to the drinking life.
He was 64 when he died but his first significant brush with death came
more than six years ago when -- as he openly admitted -- his ''old
ways'' caught up with him, and he underwent a liver transplant in
America. The operation was successful, and he seemed to have no problem
in schooling his gregarious nature to follow a no-alcohol diet. But in
pub parlance Brian Lenihan was always known as ''the acceptable face of
Charlie Haughey''.
A lawyer by profession, he was generally respected in Northern Ireland
as one of the few Southern politicians of his day, who voiced concern
beyond the nationalists' cause. Yet his humour and informality did not
always extricate him from thorny predicaments when dealing with
Unionists. His lack of reticence over a joint communique to be signed by
the British and Irish prime ministers, recognising the totality of
relationships between the two countries, so infuriated Mrs Thatcher that
she retreated from any mould-breaking proposals.
Yesterday Charles Haughey described his loyal colleague as someone
incapable of bearing a grudge, but it is ironic that, by sacrificing
Lenihan, Haughey had unconsciously ensured the dubious art of cronyism
was played out.
There always was anarchic bravado in Brian Lenihan, and long ago in
his Minister of Education days he would take off for a pub in Kilcock,
outside Dublin, when nothing much was doing in the Dail. One afternoon a
sudden Cabinet meeting was called, forcing his secretary to make frantic
contact. ''Is that Moriarty's?'' he asked. A voice replied: ''Yes.'' The
secretary continued: ''Is there a snug in the back?'' The voice
answered: ''There is.'' Hesistantly, the secretary inquired: ''And is
Brian Lenihan there by any chance?'' The voice replied: ''Speaking.''
Today, modern Ireland would testily demand to know what a Government
Minister was doing at a public house in the middle of the afternoon. But
in Brian Lenihan's case his harum-scarum quality was part of folklore,
and the country loved him for it.

FOUR British businessmen were found guilty of illegal defence sales to
Saddam Hussein, though how explosive devices can be termed ''defence
sales'' is one of those somersaulting exercises in semantics so beloved
of hack politicians and second-rate diplomats.
One of the businessmen Mr Grecian (I resist the temptation of
referring to 2000 and the millennium) claims to have been involved with
MI5 and MI6, and says he alerted them to Saddam's supergun project.
Whitehall documents detailing his involvement with British
Intelligence were withheld through public immunity certificates signed
by ministers. He pled guilty to illegal trading with Iraq, only after
being told his defence could not have access to information contained in
these documents.
The convicted businessmen are now in the Court of Appeal and the
documents concerned have now been released by a ruling of Lord Chief
Justice Taylor. The memoranda shows, according to his lawyers, ''that he
was condoned and encouraged in his activities''.
One of the documents revealed that intelligence officers had
considered ''blowing the gaffe'' about Mr Grecian's role in uncovering
Saddam's supergun. His fear that Saddam, given such information, would
have him killed is by no means far-fetched.
An officer in British Intelligence, in a note read out to the court,
and shown on British television, opines: ''If we are not too squeamish,
we might use this point to ensure his silence.''
Read that again. This is the opinion of an agent of the British state,
operating under the aegis of a minister of state, putting the
frighteners on a British citizen. More Mafia than Bull Dog Drummond,
with blackmail and threats to life as the modus operandi.
Did Government ministers read the documents? Why give immunity to
documents they haven't read? If they did read the documents why should
they ban their use by the defence? Having read the documents did they
sack the MI5 and MI6 thugs exposed therein? Should ministers of state,
if parties to a cover-up, and a miscarriage of justice, be allowed to
continue holding public office?
The crudity of Britain's spy industry is disturbing, but our spies are
daft. They were either daft and thus became spies, or were spies and
thus became daft. I think it was the former.
When we were kids the teacher asked what we wanted to be when we grew
up. It was a tough area where a cat with a tail was clearly a tourist.
Expectations were low. It was train drivers, etc. One kid wanted to
empty middens, he was already in training. But no kid stood up and said
''spy''. Our expectations weren't that low.
With ludicrous irony these dafties were employed by ''intelligence''
agencies. During wars intelligent people were conscripted into MI5 and
MI6. Compton McKenzie was conscripted into British Intelligence during
the First World War and was appalled at the intellectual level of the
''regulars''.
Years afterwards he expressed these opinions and was threatened with
dungeons dark. In the Second World War Malcolm Muggeridge and many
others were conscripted into British Intelligence and were appalled at
the intellectual level of the ''regulars''. After the war, when he tried
to write about this, Muggs was given laldy by the authorities.
The great wartime achievements of British Intelligence were spawned by
conscripts. It was conscript mathematicians and logicians that gave
allies the enigma decoding machine. The black propaganda and
disinformation which so bamboozled Hitler were products of the
conscripts.
Regulars such as Ian Fleming, more flash than substance, as were his
books, were in control between and after the wars. In the thirties
Cambridge University became a finishing school for the KGB. Upper-class
twits in the throes of booze and rampaging promiscuity were put in
charge of the shop. The inmates took over the asylum. But Britain wasn't
alone.
In most other countries the dafties were also into intelligence and
did infinitely more harm to their own countries than to its perceived
enemies. The KGB killed millions of Soviet citizens. Annihilated the
Soviet intelligentsia. Decimated the ranks of the General Staff just
before Hitler's invasion. The KGB was composed of brutalised numbskulls
who learned their trade butchering old Bolsheviks. Beria was a monster.
He had his henchmen bring him young Russian schoolgirls whom he raped
and killed.
The CIA put the wind up James Forrestal, an American Defence
Secretary, to such an extent that he dived out a high-rise window in his
pyjamas because he thought the Red Army was coming to get him. The CIA
backed fascist and neo-fascist dictators, losers one and all, throughout
the Third World. Millions were alienated.
They concocted lunatic plots to kill Castro with poisoned or exploding
cigars. It was like The Goon Show only dafter. The Bay of Pigs became a
joke throughout Latin America. J Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, tried to
grab some of the action. He too was a fruitcake, dressing in little
girly dresses to party with intimate pals from the Agency.
We should pension off these nutcases, in our post-cold war world,
before they try to justify their existence by inventing new enemies, as
witch hunters invented new witches. In today's world we have massive
provision of data about everything under the sun. Analysts able to
interpret this data can tell us everything we need to know.
Spies are obsolete, dysfunctional, and have an attitude problem. They
don't fit in with normal human beings. Attracted by the yahoo ribaldry
of Prime Minister's Question Time they might fancy a parliamentary
career. J Edgar Hoover would have slotted nicely on to the Tory benches
and added something to their parties. Anthony Blunt could have been a
Labour Whip, prepared to take the rough with the smooth, as a good whip
must. But it wouldn't work. They might end up in Government and we can't
have loonies running the country. Who says?

MAYBE I am the only Tory in the land who takes this view, but I feel
very sorry for Clare Short. She was asked her opinion about a serious
issue, the decriminalisation of cannabis, and responded by saying that
present methods of dealing with drug abuse were not working and that
such a move should be ''considered''. For that she was disowned by every
senior member of her party and paraded in front of the nation as a
wicked woman.
We saw pictures, obviously arranged for maximum effect, of her making
her way along to Mr Tony Blair's office. It was a public humiliation;
she was filmed as though she was going to a court martial, as she surely
was.
Have her in, Tony, and make sure the media sees it; that will stop any
others thinking they can express personal opinions. Can't you just hear
the spin doctors telling him? Caps off, face the leader, eat humble pie,
go back out and promise the pack you will never offend again. This is
your last chance, lady, one more slip and you are history.
God, doesn't the party of the people display such compassion? You do
not have to be a psychiatrist to appreciate that Clare Short is a caring
person who has passionate beliefs. There is no place for them in New
Labour. If the line is not toed they cut off your foot.
I have thought for some time that, behind the flashing teeth and the
empty rhetoric, there is a cruel side to Mr Blair's character. Anyone is
likely to be sacrificed on the altar of his ambition.
What was the mortal sin which Ms Short committed? She said the way we
tackle drug abuse is not working. Is it? Can we point to a solid success
story in keeping young people away from the misery they cause or are
there thousands of new recruits to the pill and the needle every year?
Ms Short suggested we could consider legalising cannabis.
My gut feeling tells me that would be a mistaken road to go down, but
I know and respect people who feel the opposite. In a free country
surely someone has the right to express a personal opinion, even a
member of the Shadow Cabinet.
If Clare Short made a mistake would not a decent fellow, a friend
even, put an arm round her shoulder and suggest caution? What sort of
man would make you pay in public? A man desperate for power, that's who.
On a related topic let me add my voice to those who think the jail
sentence on Graeme Steel for growing cannabis in his back garden at
Dingley Dell, or wherever he and his girl hang out, was ridiculously
harsh. There was not a scrap of evidence that he intended the drug be
sold to anyone else.
Like many another parent, and grandparent, you thank your lucky stars
it was not your kid. I send my sympathy to David and Judy Steel.
This week I have been dipping into Matthew Parris's new book Great
Parliamentary Scandals which Julia Langdon will be reviewing for you. I
was much taken by the foreword by David Mellor and the introduction to
his work by the author himself.
Mellor reminds us that Bill Deedes said recently that talented young
people he meets these days are going into the media and not politics.
''And why not? The media conveys an air of glamour which the public
finds deeply appealing, and who can doubt that opining on, or writing
1000 words about, a problem is much easier than trying to do something
constructive about it.
''The copious quantities of fame and wealth on offer to leading media
personalities must be infinitely more attractive to the young than the
cup of bile which top politicians are daily and publicly forced to
drink.''
Indeed. It would appear to be perfectly acceptable for Michael Aspel
to leave several wives and children yet still remain the popular host of
This Is Your Life, if Michael Portillo did the same he would not keep
his post for a week.
Mellor also touches on the great British joy in ''Schadenfreude'', the
pleasure we take in the humiliation of our ''betters''. ''Anyone who
doubts the damage this does should talk to a candid friend abroad. There
they see it as a sign of a peculiarly British immaturity confusing
public and private acts.''
Ironic, too, that since his own demise, Mr Mellor has probably made
more money from the media than he ever did as a politician.
Parris ponders on why so many politicians take such personal risks.
''Nobody without a gambling streak, a taste for uncertainty and a belief
in his own luck would embark on a Commons career. Statistically, most
must ''fail'' within their own terms which are (usually these days) the
achievement of high office. The hours and conditions are arduous and the
salary no more than than most MPs could have hoped to attract in a
career outside.''
He goes on to write: ''They (politicians) are attention-seekers. The
job rarely offers real power or influence. But it regularly offers
publicity. You may do little but you are somebody.''
And a very high price can be paid for that tag. He reminds us that not
all miscreant MPs are found out.
''I never was and nor were any of my gay Tory friends. The calculation
is not between safety and certain ruin but between safety and risk.''
In the world of Tony Blair and the bully boys there will never be any
skeletons in the Labour cupboard. His MPs will behave, they will say
what we tell them do, they will bark when I clap. Why do I have the
feeling that this will not produce a Government of the best and the
brightest? Why do I conclude that it would be much more fun to share a
bag of chips with Ms Clare Short than a dinner at the Dorchester with Mr
Tony Blair?

<TEXT>
FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
THE SFA have made a first move to investigate an incident involving
Airdrie's Sean Sweeney which occurred during last week's Coca-Cola Cup
match against Dundee.
It was alleged that Sweeney had kicked Dundee's Morten Weighorst
during the match, but referee Jim McCluskey missed the incident. And
Tayside police later confirmed that they would not take action.
However, the report of referee supervisor Bob Valentine has reached
the SFA, and the incident is included in his report. An official said
later: ''We are writing to Airdrie and the player to seek their
comments.''
Those replies will be placed in front of the disciplinary commitee who
will decide what further action to take in any.
But that was not the end of the troubles for Airdrie at the SFA. Club
captain Jimmy Sandison will miss the next two games through automatic
suspension.
He was due to be out of Saturday's match against Morton because of his
previous record. But he will now be on the sidelines the following
Saturday after being red-carded in the dressing room after last week's
league match against Dundee.
Referee Dougie Smith, in his report, stated that he had yellow-carded
Sandison during the game and again afterwards for his comments to a
linesman. The two yellow cards added up to a sending off.
* ADRIAN Sprott, who scored four goals last midweek, is looking
forward to Sunday's Challenge Cup final.
He netted all of Stenhousemuir's goals in their win against Berwick,
and said yesterday: ''That was a huge boost for everyone at the club.
The win helps our league position, and we can now concentrate on the
final.''
Manager Terry Christie added: ''Adrian was brilliant and even though
two of the goals were from the penalty spot, it was an outstanding
performance.''
* GARY McSwegan need think only of Dumbarton to stop himself -- and
the rest of his Dundee United team-mates -- from getting carried away
now that they have made it to the top of the first division.
McSwegan said yesterday that the memory of his debut at Boghead, where
the home side won 1-0, means his feet will remain firmly on the ground.
United manager Billy Kirkwood has gone out of his way to keep United's
surge to the top low-key, but McSwegan said: ''I will never need anyone
drumming it into me that we have achieved nothing so far in our bid to
get back to the premier division.
'I learned not to take anything for granted in this league the day I
made my first appearance at Dumbarton. Things couldn't possibly have
been any worse at Boghead.
''That defeat brought it home to us that you can be up one week and
down the next. It also taught us that you only get what you put in --
and I don't think we'll forget that in a long time.''
* DUNFERMLINE manager Bert Paton has brought a Finnish
internationalist centre half, 29-year-old Kari Rissinen from Helsinki,
on a fortnight's trial. The player, who has 14 full caps, is due to play
for his country against Russia on November 14.
His club, Finnpa, values him at #150,000. ''I have to see him play
before I can decide if I want him,'' said Paton. ''He certainly comes
highly recommended.''
* MONTROSE chairman Bryan Keith has backed Walter Smith's call for
small clubs to amalgamate. The Ibrox manager said earlier this week that
more clubs should follow the example of Inverness Thistle and Inverness
Caledonian by joining forces.
But Keith fears it will never happen because the supporters don't want
it. ''I have always advocated amalgamation as being the way forward,''
said Keith. ''We have four teams in Angus, but there is not enough
support for four.
''If we had an Angus United we could challenge at the top. That is
unlikely to happen. If the side played in Forfar, for example, the fans
of the other three clubs would turn their backs on the new team.''

<TEXT>
A WORLD famous fish and chip shop chain is to link up with an award
winning Scottish competitor to open a branch in the Scottish Highlands.
The Harry Ramsden's chain has unveiled plans for a new restaurant in
Inverness which will create more than 100 jobs.
The franchise for the #1.5m venture has been won by A9 Leisure Ltd,
which runs Smitty's restaurants in Aviemore and Grantown on Spey.
The new Harry Ramsden's in the Highland capital's Cameron Business
Park will be only the third in Scotland after Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Mr Alan Smith Sr, of A9 Leisure Ltd, said: ''Having obtained the
franchise, we had offers to exercise it in other Scottish towns but we
wanted to set up in the Highlands, and Inverness is the ideal
location.''
The Smith's family businesses have won five awards for quality in five
consecutive years and their Grantown operation has just been named as
Scotland's Fish and Chip Shop of the Year.
Mr Smith added: ''Apart from the obvious jobs boost, local suppliers
will have the opportunity to supply the Inverness outlet and will also
gain the chance to supply others in the group.''

<HEADLINE>Vauxhall car workers to ballot on pay strike</HEADLINE>

VAUXHALL's 9000 car workers are to be balloted on strike action aimed
at an improved pay offer and a two-hour reduction in the working week.
Union leaders who addressed shop stewards at the Ellesmere Port plant
yesterday will repeat the exercise at Luton today, spelling out their
opposition to an offer of a 3.5% rise this year and an increase based on
the inflation rate next September.
Voting begins tomorrow on a campaign of industrial action in support
of a ''fairer'' pay offer and a two-hour cut in the 39-hour week. Action
being considered includes ''seizing'' a shorter working week by walking
off the job each Friday lunchtime.
Mr Tony Woodley, national secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, said Vauxhall could afford to increase its pay offer and
cut hours. ''For the past 10 years, Vauxhall has been the most
consistently profitable car company in Britain. We're delighted at that
success, which has been achieved through the hard work of our members.''
Vauxhall said its offer was ''very reasonable'' in the light of the
stagnant car market and the current economic climate.
The result of the ballot will be known at the end of this month, by
which time Ford could also be facing a strike ballot unless it, too,
improves on a 3% pay offer and concedes a shorter working week.
With British plants producing most of the engines for General Motors'
and Ford's European assembly plants, any strike action could have an
immediate and widespread impact.
Rover, Ford's Jaguar subsidiary, Rolls-Royce Motors, and Honda already
operate a 37-hour week. German car workers, including those employed by
General Motors and Ford, work 35 hours.

Q. I HAVE noticed a bit of blood on the toilet paper when I go to the
lavatory these days. Can I safely assume that it's just due to piles?
A. No, I agree that most cases of rectal bleeding in males are due to
piles, but a minority are due to more sinister causes -- especially in
men over the age of 35. To be frank, cancer of the rectum usually
announces its presence by causing blood loss with the bowel motions. And
rectal carcinoma is very common in the middle and later years of life.
So really, anybody who notices red blood on the loo paper should go
and see the doc within a few days. I know it's embarrassing to have an
examination of the rectum -- but again and again I've known it to be
life-saving, because it has diagnosed a cancer at an early stage.
Incidentally, I've had several letters about piles, so I'll return to
that subject in a fortnight's time.
Q. I'M a man of five feet eight inches (1.73 metres). What should I
weigh? And is it okay if it goes up as I get older?
A. A man of your height should normally weigh around 11 stone, which
is 70 kilos, sir.
I'm afraid it's a myth that a man's weight should increase as he gets
older. Nowadays, medical opinion is that throughout your life, you
should try to keep your poundage to about what it was when you were in
your twenties.
Q. I AM 19, and I like to have just one cigarette a day. Am I right in
thinking that this couldn't possibly do me any harm?
A. Well, I reluctantly admit that you're absolutely right, young sir.
A single cigarette per day cannot have any significant effect on the
health of a fit man who has no chest or heart trouble.
But -- and it's one of those big buts -- the trouble with cigarettes
is that they contain the highly addictive drug nicotine -- the human
brain loves it. So in a little while, your brain may well start urging
you to have another . . . and another . . . and another. That's how many
folk started. Prenez garde.
Q. I NOTICED your advice in The Herald about keeping one's cholesterol
down. I have had angina for some years, and neither my GP nor the
specialist has ever said anything about cholesterol.
So would I be right in thinking that some doctors don't believe that a
person's cholesterol level matters?
A. No, you'd be wrong! If you have angina -- which is a lack of good
blood supply to the heart -- it's inconceivable that your doctors would
have omitted to check your cholesterol.
Why? Because a high blood cholesterol is one of the factors that can
cause angina and other heart problems.
But in your case, my guess is that your cholesterol is OK -- so your
physicians haven't felt it necessary to chat to you about it.
Q. I AM a businessman (43) and things have been really tough at work
lately. This is ''getting to me'' and I am feeling pretty miserable. To
my embarrassment, I sometimes cry when I am alone. There are days when
life just seems hopeless.
My wife wants me to go and see our GP, but my feeling is that a man
ought to be able to ''work through'' these things for himself. Would you
agree?
A. No I wouldn't! One of the biggest health problems with men -- and
particularly with Scottish men -- is that they won't go to the doctor
when they are clearly suffering from stress and strain.
Sir, to say that you are not well is the understatement of the week.
To go to your GP is not being a ''jessie''; it is simply the intelligent
thing to do.
So please, put your pride in your pocket and make an appointment to
talk to your doctor. Do get a move on -- before things get any worse.
Q. I READ about your theory that eating fried breakfasts -- instead of
porridge -- is responsible for Scotland's very high coronary rate. But
I've had a porridge breakfast all my life, and I recently took a
coronary. Please explain.
A. Well, there are all sorts of factors which cause temporary attacks
-- and in some people, you can't identify a cause at all. But taking an
overall view, the three things which are probably most significant in
causing Scotland's twentieth-century epidemic of coronaries are smoking,
lack of exercise and eating too much ''saturated'' fats.
Saturated fats are the ones you get in fry-ups and in meat, milk,
cheese and butter. Most of them are of animal origin.
Nutritionists say that we only need one tablespoonful of fat per day
in order to stay healthy. But most of us eat about eight times as much
as that. This is something akin to national suicide . . .
Q. I FEEL reluctant to write to you about this, but I have had one or
two episodes of impotence recently. I'm 23 and I wonder if this could be
due to a lack of male hormone.
A. Hormone deficiency is extremely rare in young men. Putting it
bluntly, if you have to shave each morning and you don't speak with a
soprano voice, it's wildly unlikely that a young fellow like you is
lacking in male hormones. In your age group, impotence is much more
likely to be due to tiredness, anxiety, or drinking too much alcohol.
(Shakespeare was absolutely right in Macbeth when he said that it
''increases the desire, but takes away the performance . . .'').
I'd like you to go to a GP or a Family Planning Clinic for a check-up
plus a chat about how you can avoid this problem in the future. I'm
certain that they will be able to reassure you that you have no hormone
deficiency, and are not ''lacking'' as a man in any way at all. Good
luck.
Q. I TOOK a bit of hard knock playing rugby a week ago, and am still
limping. Is it necessary to go to a doctor with this kind of thing, or
does everything usually clear up all right in the end?
A. A rough general rule is this. If an injury which got you on a
Saturday hasn't cleared up by the Monday, then it's time to seek help.
This may not necessarily have to be from your GP; if you have access
to a physiotherapy practice or a sports injury clinic, then it may be
well worth contacting them.
Osteopaths are good with sports injuries too, though you must make
sure that the person you consult is properly qualified. Unfortunately,
there are still plenty of folk who call themselves ''osteopaths'' but
have no real training. Genuine, trained osteopaths have the letters MRO
and DO after their names.
* IF YOU have a query about your health, write to Dr David Delvin at
The Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. Dr D cannot reply in
person, but will try to respond in this column. Your name will not be
published.

BACK, once more, to Hamilton's Bell College of Technology, where it
looks very much like war, what with Principal John Reid calling in the
local CID to discover who has been making ''serious allegations'' about
the running of the establishment in anonymous letters to the media.
As it happens Watson, here comes another of the bally things, and a
curious missive it is, first apologising to the principal for anything
said previously that may have turned out to be, er, entirely wrong, then
setting out terms for a truce. Or is it surrender? The writers (''a
concerned group'') of the unsigned note, admit that unsigned notes were
''on reflection . . . probably not the best way to air our grievances''.
Then comes the really odd bit.
''We guarantee to desist from any further mailings providing the
police vendetta by the principal is called off forthwith. If the
principal is agreeable to this truce he should, as a signal of
agreement, park his car facing outwards on the 8 November, 1995.''
Meanwhile, following this ''final communication'', we find in a
separate envelope a series of allegations involving the wage bill for
Bell Innovations Ltd, a college offshoot, and remarks on Scottish Office
efforts to investigate salary rises for senior managers there which are
not, to put it mildly, the sort of thing you publish this side of the
law courts.
Mr Reid's angry advisers say he is the victim of a vicious smear
campaign and deny the allegations. As one Bell to another, however, we
say Hamilton's pride is plainly not a happy place.
On good authority
TRUST Private Eye to get it right. Well you would, wouldn't you, what
with its matchless reputation for accuracy and the loving care and
attention it has always given to the facts? Thus in its latest issue the
scandal sheet dishes the dirt on Scottish quangoland, telling it like it
very possibly may or may not be with regard to the North of Scotland
Water Authority, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and George Kynoch MP.
You'll remember Mr Kynoch. A rising star. Or as the Eye styles him
''the secretary of state for Scotland, George Kynoch''. Wasn't he the
one appointed by Prime Minister Heseltine?
The wicked web
ANYONE who ever wondered what happened to the National Front will be
as intrigued as we were to learn that the merry patriots have split
again, with some re-emerging as (do we love this, or what?) ''the
National Democrats''.
More to the point, they are crawling all over those areas of the
Internet with even a passing interest in politics.
Sadly (for them at least) virtual fascism doesn't seem to be quite
taking off. To say that some respondents have been insensitive to the
call of blood and nation is to say the least of it. Take, for an
example, a recent exchange.
Q: ''Is it true that the National Democrats is the new name of the
National Front? Are they trying to smarten up their image by associating
themselves with democracy? If so, I don't think anyone will be fooled.''
A: ''Seemed to work for the Liberal Democrats . . . ''
Also extraordinarily active, meanwhile, are a mob calling themselves
Third Way, another group with delightful views on race. Thanks to the
wonders of technology they now boast a Scottish Internet contact address
which, in the interests of justice and fair play, we aren't going to
give you.
Unhealthy sign
THEY don't write headlines like this anymore, and for a very good
reason.
From the Dunfermline Press comes one of the sickest we've seen in many
a week.
The story: ''Dunfermline MP Rachel Squire has voiced her concerns that
health chiefs have already made up their minds to deny the town a new
midwife-led unit''.
The headline: ''MP fears baby hopes will be still-born''.
We make that nothing out of 10, guys.
Going for broke

PURELY in the interests of science, you understand, David Weeks,
neuropsychologist and therapist at the University of Edinburgh, has been
hunting out the most eccentric city in America.
Actually, he has been plugging his new book, Eccentrics, a Study of
Sanity and Strangeness, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and selling it to the
locals by telling them they boast the highest per capita population of
what are politely known as ''nonconformists'' in a country famous as the
natural home of the not-at-all-odd.
To our mind it is a novel approach to marketing to tell prospective
customers they're a bunch of weirdos, but we are neither
neuropsychologists nor therapists. It was interesting to note, however,
that Weeks has based his rankings on the number of responses to posted
inquiries he has received from different areas over the past 10 years.
Ask yourself: a letter arrives from thousands of miles away inquiring,
doubtless terribly politely, ''Are you plain daft?'' What sort of person
do you think would be first to whip out the Biro and fire off a
response? Our money's on the one who says he's second cousin to the King
of Siam.
Weeks himself has said he's not sure whether Minnesota placed high in
its number of eccentrics because people in the region felt ''more
comfortable'' identifying themselves as oddballs, or was just the result
of earlier reports of his study getting more play in the local media.
In defence of his research techniques, however, Edinburgh U's hero
last week told the Minneapolis Star Tribune: ''It is an unusual way of
sampling an unusual population . . . I couldn't very well knock on
10,000 doors and ask: ''Are you eccentric?'' Sending off 10,000 letters
is, of course, the sensible way to do it.
Can't wait till he starts on Dundee.
Answer the call
FINALLY, doesn't it do the heart good to know that, hoaxed or not, the
Queen was ready to do ''anything she could'' to keep Quebec in Canada?
It's called ''being above politics''. Couldn't happen here, now could
it?

SHINTY
OBAN Camanachd's Gordon MacIntyre is set to complete a remarkable
come-back by playing against Glasgow University on Saturday, his first
game since losing an eye seven weeks ago.
MacIntyre has asked the Camanachd Association to reconsider their ban
on facial protection so that he can wear an ice hockey helmet and visor
in the match.
The association's executive will look at the helmet, and it is likely
they will overturn the ban.
''I intend to play,'' said MacIntyre. ''I would like to think that no
obstacles will be put in my way. I am looking forward to playing and am
being realistic about my prospects. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work,
but I feel I deserve the chance to prove to myself that I can come
back.''
Kingussie and Glasgow Mid Argyll, with six straight wins between them
in the new premier league, are the clubs of the month for October.
Kingussie's first team, who lead the championship at the half-way
stage by three points, have secured the first prize of #100 for their
three straight wins. They are the only club left in the top flight with
an unbeaten record. Their second team leads north Division 2, and also
are unbeaten, with four wins and a draw from five games.
The Badenoch side are favourites to pick up the first national premier
league title.
Glasgow Mid Argyll, with four wins on the trot -- three of them last
month -- have clinched third place in the league and the #50 Marine
Harvest runners-up award.
Manager Burton Morrison said: ''We have benefited from one or two
positional changes and with a lot of hard work and the settled side, we
are now beginning to reap the benefits.

A new community project aims to help the so-called macho sex forget
ancient hang-ups. Ann Donald sits in on a wide-ranging discussion
REAL men don't eat hummus or quiche or fat-free yoghurt or fresh
vegetables. According to the group of ''real men'' -- witness the beards
and the tattoos -- sitting around with mugs of tea in hand in a
converted Glasgow shop, that old chestnut took a nosedive months ago.
For as well as debating the lack of nutritional food available in
their local supermarket, the candid and informed conversation also
embraces male sexual performance, suicidal impulses, cirumcision, and
depression.
Behind the group, a large board bears witness to an earlier
brainstorming session they conducted. Words like ''anger''
''bereavement'' and ''PMT'' have been scribbled down. After our two-hour
interview, the group nip outside for a smoke.
This is no pseudo Iron John meets Jesus-sandal-wearing New Man out in
the woods for a collective primal scream scenario. This is the real
thing -- the Danny Morrison Health Project, the first of its kind
outside London to be set up and run by local men aiming to improve the
physical, mental, and emotional health of their male neighbours.
Having received enough funding from the Scottish Office and the Health
Board for the next year, the project opened its doors for business last
month. Although their premises, tucked away in Drumchapel's shopping
precinct are temporary, co-ordinator Tommy Riley and colleagues are
fired up to start making inroads on their crucial objectives.
''First, we want to establish this place as a drop-in centre for men
wanting to ask any health questions,'' he says, gesturing to the
rough-and-ready space. ''Another thing is to carry out a health-needs
assessment for Drumchapel men and publish a survival pack that will deal
with every health issue wee Johnny is likely to encounter from the day
he's born to the day he dies. How to check for things like male breast
cancer, testicular and prostate cancers. The final aim is to get more
men involved with family planning.''
Alhough all involved concede it is a massive task, their joint
commitment, knowledge, and enthusiasm has been spurred on by the
staggering lack of information on male health. It was while Riley was
training as a health volunteer with Drumchapel Community Health Project
(with which this project will work in tandem) that he observed this at
first hand.
''In the health library there was everything a woman could ever want
to know about her body, but there was nothing, absolutely nothing, for
men.''
Suitably fired, Riley enlisted Morrison, after whom the project is
named, and friends culled from Drumchapel Men's Issues Group, which also
promotes discussion of pertinent health and social issues, and together
they drummed up local and official support culminating in a grant of
roughly #30,000.
An ardent supporter of the project is Pauline Craig, health visitor
with Drumchapel Community Health Project. For despite the recent flurry
of health/lifestyle magazines aimed at men, the disturbing statistics
for the average Scottish male's health indicate that it will take more
than a magazine article on executive stress or six sex tips to make a
dent in the national male psyche.
As Craig points out, more men die annually of prostate cancer than
women of cervical cancer, while men are twice as likely to die of
suicide, violence, and accidents than women. Yet it is men who are often
left by the wayside when it comes to health education, with most
information ending up on women's laps, given their traditional role as
carers.
Craig attributes this to the old macho cliches that determine a man as
invulnerable and strong. ''Men aren't very good at coming forward and
saying they have a problem,'' she explains. ''What we have to do is show
men that this is their issue and encourage them to take responsibility
and not leave their health up to chance or their partner to take care
of.''
The well-catalogued social conditions intrinsic to Drumchapel with its
high unemployment, poverty, and poor housing, inevitably filter
downwards to affect the individual's health. And, as with the rest of
the country, there exists a support network for women but nothing for
men.
According to Craig, depression is chronic among many of the men she
consults. ''They just don't know what to do with themselves,'' she says.
''And how that translates is in lack of self-esteem, suicide, and
domestic violence.''
To this list Riley and his colleagues add alcoholism and addiction to
prescribed tranquillisers which, they say, leads to agoraphobia. ''The
amount of alcoholics I know who are on prescribed liquid Temazepam is
unbelievable,'' says one. ''Guys suffering from depression are pumped so
full of tablets for so long that they become so zombified that they're
scared to leave the house,'' says another. ''It's tragic, the number of
them in Drumchapel.''
Craig and the project members believe their word-of-mouth and
open-door approach gives them a crucial credibility and insight, since
everyone involved with the project has experienced personally the same
problems.
''It's going to be an uphill struggle to get men to come forward,''
says health volunteer James McConnell. ''But we've been there, seen it,
done it as regards depression, suicidal impulses, breakdowns.
''We might not have the piece of paper saying we're qualified health
professionals, but we've been practised and experimented on and there's
a wealth of expertise between us all. We're rebuilds, and we want to
apply ourselves to the situation other people are in.''
McConnell, though, stresses that a list of professional experts in
specific fields will be on hand, to which men can be referred and to
complement the project's experience.
As well as providing a friendly and informative counselling service,
free complementary therapies such as aromatherapy, shiatzu and Tai Chi
are to be offered as a viable long-term alternative to tablets and
tranquillisers.
The A-Z survival pack, couched in no-nonsense layman's language, will
be updated regularly and the confusion over male sexual education will
be addressed, with speakers such as sexual therapists invited along to
offer advice.
As part of this wholesale body and soul overhaul, the project has set
its sights on a nearby building it aims to transform into a cafe selling
wholesome food at a price local people can afford.

CHECK-UP
* RESEARCHERS at Glasgow University have the overweight taped. They
say waist circumference is an accurate measure of obesity and one that
can be easily tested. Men with a waist circumference of more than 102cm
(41in) and women with a waist of more than 88cm (35in) are overweight
and should consider dieting. In the light of these findings this simple
measurement could be a useful tool as a health check, reports Monitor
Weekly.
* LACK of central heating can almost double the risk of strokes during
the winter. A study of 49 stroke patients aged 35 to 74 showed that they
were more likely than the control group not to have centrally heated
homes, says a recent report in GP, the doctors' magazine.
Another study based on elderly people in Glasgow, Paisley, Coatbridge
and Airdrie has led researchers to conclude that around 1000 people die
annually from hypothermia, well above the official figure of 300, says a
report, Urban Hypothermia In The West of Scotland, published in the
British Medical Journal.
* OVER half the waking hours of a 17-month-old baby are devoted to
play. When a child is ill, access to toys and games can be a source of
comfort during a period of pain, confusion and anxiety.
Now research has shown that toys and play can speed up the healing
process. Those children who receive this special attention, and play
regularly while in hospital, remain in a better state of health once
they return home.
But greater awareness of the very real benefits of play in hospital is
required, says the British Toy and Hobby Association, if children are to
enjoy the full advantages that access to toys and play can bring.
Research has also shown that it is more intellectually stimulating for
children to have several inexpensive toys rather than one or two costly
items.
* IF you, or your partner, suffer from snoring you will know how
disrupting it can be. A heavy snorer is likely to wake up several times
during the night, causing the sufferer to be over-tired, irritable and
often incapable of functioning properly.
Edinburgh doctor Elizabeth Scott says she has found a natural way to
stop snoring without drugs, operations or gadgetry. Basically it
involves special breathing exercises and she recommends singing for 20
minutes a day, which will help widen the upper throat and strengthen the
soft palate. She explains her methods in The Natural Way to Stop Snoring
(Orion, #4.99).
* STRESSFUL events before the age of two double the risk of diabetes
developing in later life, says a recent report in GP magazine.
Researchers believe that these findings strengthen evidence that stress
is a trigger for diabetes because of its effect on the auto-immune
system. Negative events include the separation of parents, their serious
illness or injury, hospitalisation or death, and moving house more than
twice.
* WOMEN who are thinking about taking hormone replacement therapy to
protect their bones from osteoporosis but are worried that it may
increase the risk of breast cancer may find a new booklet helpful. It
covers women's concerns in detail. Copies at #2 are available from the
National Osteoporosis Society, PO Box 10, Radstock, Bath, BA3 3YB.

ONCE the suffering and death of a child was accepted as a sorrowful
but almost inevitable part of life. Before the development of
antibiotics and vaccination, their bodies were specially vulnerable to
infection.
Today, a child's death is seen as a result of exceptional misfortune.
It's felt as a betrayal. In a way that would have seemed
incomprehensible to earlier generations, and must seem so still to the
inhabitants of most Third World countries, we take a child's right to
life so much for granted that we regard an early death almost as a
defiance of natural law.
So when we were told that the National Health Service, one of the few
remaining sources of national -- if wounded -- pride, had declined to
spend #75,000 trying to prolong a 10-year-old's life we were outraged.
A wealthy benefactor stepped in to pay for Jaymee Bowen's -- Child B
-- leukaemia treatment. Now, although her health authority is
part-funding fees at a private clinic, her father is forced to hawk her
story, pillage her private pain, to pay for further care. It is a
repulsive prospect. What choice is there? Is money now the only real
measure of life's worth? And its distribution to be decided by those who
have it?
But, before we are overwhelmed by indignation at Jaymee's fate, we
might recall the case of Laura Davies, the child from Eccles, born in
April 1988 with a bowel outside her body. She spent the first year of
her life in hospital, fed a liquid diet through tubes and attended by
two surgeons and a high-powered medical team. She survived,
miraculously, beyond her fourth birthday but needed a multi-organ
transplant, an operation no-one had survived for more than a year. Her
British doctors advised that nothing more could or should be done.
Looking at the uncomplicated faces of her parents you saw tigers
fighting for their wounded cub. Helped by funds raised in a public
appeal, they took her to the US where, for #1m, two massive operations
were carried out. She died in November 1993.
In all such cases, several questions are asked: will treatment
significantly improve the child's chances of survival? If the child
survives, will it enjoy an acceptable quality of life? Is the suffering
caused by the treatment justified? And can the treatment be afforded? In
debates about health service rationing, these are sometimes treated as
if they were distinct questions for which there are objective answers.
In reality the questions are inseparable and the answers subjective.
In Laura Davies's case, the answers to all the questions according to
the medical assessments were no. In the last painful months of her life,
even her weary parents had second thoughts. Yet public support for her
cause was enormous.
Nobody can quantify suffering or quality of life. No computer
programme can balance a 2% chance of survival against the pain of six
months' chemotherapy. Nor can it balance the merits of a #75,000
operation for a child against the 30 ulcer operations that would cost
the same amount. That's why arguments over whether Jaymee's fate were
decided on clinical or financial grounds are spurious.
Rationing of health care has always existed, by waiting-list or by
price. But the choices have become harder. Advances in medical
techniques allow life-saving procedures that would have been impossible
just 10 years ago, but only at enormous cost. Some decisions look
simple: if you want rid of the tattoo on your backside, pay for it
yourself. Other decisions are heartbreaking.
The US state of Oregon consulted the public on priorities to be given
to 709 medical conditions and their treatments. The top 587 were to be
funded. Babies weighing less than 1lb 1oz don't get funding. It sounds
brutal. With a week in intensive care costing around #4500 are similar
limits debated here?
Politicians, of course, prefer to bury the arguments about rationing,
pretending that all decisions made by doctors are purely clinical.
Health priorities deserve an open public debate. But nobody should
pretend that decisions are ever cut and dried.
I write this in the week that an old friend buried his daughter. She
was born with cystic fibrosis, and fought every step of the way to live.
Nobody -- did they? -- counted the cost. Gillian lived 18 fulfilled
years. She made it to university. Along with her parents she fought too,
for changes in the treatment on offer to others who inherited the rogue
gene.
Ninian and Janet Reid and her brother Alasdair know precisely the
value of Gillian's life. Do we know what the cost of living is? More
importantly, do we trust others to put a price on it?

THE head's splitting, the muscles are wrenched, the tongue's mashed
and normal levels of self-esteem are slipping again. ''Had one of your
'bad' days?'' ''Another of your 'wee turns'?'' Euphemism is the order of
the day. This, after all, is not what you might describe as a socially
acceptable condition.
Epilepsy still carries an immense social stigma. Let's face it --
people are scared. With an epileptic fit there can be a sense of
revulsion in addition to a combination of inadequacy and fear.
This is a condition which some are born with, and some ''grow into''.
According to the medical profession, there is not a particularly
noticeable pattern in those developing epilepsy beyond childhood.
Fit, attack or seizure, with all the medical terms having such cruel,
even violent undertones, it's little wonder that the euphemisms come in
so handy. This is not a pretty condition and the medical terminology
offers an infinitely more realistic, if socially rather repulsive view.
The sufferer can ''come to'' on the pavement with a smashed head; or
know they are about to have an attack in the middle of an important
meeting, or wake to discover a blood-stained pillow and the effects of
incontinence.
All these and more, offer the sufferer a fairly constant sense of
anxiety and often a subsequent fear of going out, going to work and even
of going to sleep.
In medical terms, it's clear that the sensations just before the onset
of an attack (for those who aware of them) are extremely distressing.
There can be sudden strange smells, tastes, a sense of falling or
flashing lights. There is, above all, absolute confusion, a sense of
complete other-worldliness in which reality is jumbled to the extent
that even relationships are confused.
Only rarely considered, however, are the feelings of epilepsy
sufferers between attacks in the course of normal life. These are
varied:
* Fear -- of an attack in public, of injury, even of death during an
attack.
* Embarrassment -- at its sheer violence and ugliness.
* Discrimination -- which despite all equal opportunities policies, is
unfortunately still prevalent.
* Side effects of drugs -- a wide and fairly unavoidable range in some
form or another.
* Social inadequacy -- the loss of a driving licence or the inability
even to learn to drive.
At the very least, there is a general slowing down of the whole
metabolism, fatigue, dizziness, loss of concentration and sometimes
depression.
Taking a woman's perspective on the problem, a type of domino effect
emerges. In pregnancy for example, there's an exaggerated form of the
natural fear of falling and causing injury to the baby as well as to
yourself.
In fact, actual statistics show only a relatively small increased risk
of deformity in the babies of women who suffer epilepsy. In my case,
despite medical advice to the contrary from an extremely wide range of
medical experts, the still-birth of my twin baby boy, will always be
blamed in my own mind, on the two fits I experienced during pregnancy.
As a mother, there is also the fear and subsequent humiliation of
having an attack in public while in charge of small children.
Conscious of the public's general lack of knowledge and
misunderstanding of epilepsy, the Epilepsy Association of Scotland
launched The National Rose Campaign last month. This is an initiative to
heighten awareness, gain much-needed funds and above all to attempt to
rid the condition of its Victorian stigma.

AFTER six years of negotiations with Labour in the Constitutional
Convention, the Scottish Liberal Democrats (SLD) can now sit back and
reflect on a job well done. For, despite considerable difficulties, the
SLD has stuck to its task within the Convention and delivered a
consensus position on devolution through partnership with Labour, local
government and the trade unions -- and a position that has taken Labour
further than was thought possible in 1989.
Despite occasional internal squabbles the party has also managed to
convince its own supporters of the importance of the Convention and the
necessity of reaching an agreement with Labour over constitutional
change.
The SLD's role in the Constitutional Convention has never been easy.
In an ideal world the party would have occupied the middle ground within
the Convention between a minimalist Labour Party and a maximalist SNP.
However, the SNP's departure in 1989 not merely upset the SLD's hopes
of advancing its constitutional preference as an acceptable middle way,
but also deprived the party of a useful ally in negotiations and made
the Convention a contest between an electorally dominant Labour Party
and a much weaker Liberal Democrats. This had paradoxical effects.
On the one hand the SLD was in bed with an elephant, through Labour's
numerical dominance in the Convention. But, on the other hand, the SLD
was in a strong position. Without its agreement, the Convention would
fail, making it necessary for Labour to satisfy SLD demands and
aspirations in key areas. This reality gave the party some leverage
within the Convention throughout its existence.
The SLD certainly had issues to pursue in the Convention, though they
often involved a degree of give and take -- something which was often
difficult to sell to party activists.
The best example of the willingness to seek consensus and compromise
came with the adoption of an additional member system to be elected
proportionally by party lists. The party accepted this compromise, even
though it had originally argued for a special system called STV plus,
which would have established a purer form of proportional representation
than that agreed by the Convention.
However, it was the party's ability to determine the actual effects of
the electoral system in relation to the number of MSPs in a Scottish
parliament that really gave life to the principle of proportionality.
Without a sufficient number of MSPs the additional member system would
have been disproportional, and eventuality that was dealt with
comprehensively in numerous Liberal Democrat submissions to the
Convention.
To some extent the SLD's role in the Constitutional Convention was out
of tune with the strategy of the federal Liberal Democrats over the past
few years. While Ashdown stressed equidistance, Bruce and then Wallace
stressed consensus and co-operation with Labour through involvement in
the Convention.
It is significant that the SLD was allowed to exercise its autonomy in
this way -- without observers or opponents remarking upon radically
different Liberal Democrat strategies north and south of the Border.
The gap between the Scottish and federal parties has now been closed
with Ashdown's abandonment of equidistance, a situation which suits the
Scottish party very well: a Scottish political culture which has become
anti-Conservative was never going to be well-served by a policy that
asserted that the Liberal Democrats were as close to the Tories as to
Labour.
Despite problems over proportional representation, gender
representation and entrenchment, the SLD stuck to its task in the
Convention. It held its ground, negotiated in good faith and did a great
service to the principles of consensus politics and cross-party
co-operation. The party has certainly given Labour a better
constitutional position than it had before 1989, but the gains for the
SLD itself are hard to see.
Six years of hard work in the Convention have not yielded electoral
success for the SLD. Despite the party's strong performance in the 1995
unitary elections, it remains burdened by a relatively static level of
support in opinion polls and in danger of losing some of its Westminster
seats at the next election.
In 1992, support for the Liberal Democrats declined by 6.1%,
threatening Russell Johnston in Inverness and Malcolm Bruce in Gordon
among others. Indeed, the party's support has slipped at successive
General Elections since 1983, when the Alliance gained 24.5%, to lie at
13.1% in 1992.
The combined effects of the Blair factor and low national opinion poll
ratings seemed to be propelling the Liberal Democrats towards losing a
number of Scottish seats -- which will have catastrophic effects on the
party's Westminster aspirations.
There seems to be little prospect that the electorate will reward the
SLD for its efforts in the Convention -- which will be viewed, with some
justification, as a great injustice within the party itself.
After all, the SNP left the Convention in 1989 and its vote rose at
the 1992 General Election and at the 1994 European election. The Liberal
Democrats stayed in the Convention and fought their corner but gained
disappointing results in 1992 and 1994.
Recently, Jim Wallace talked up the role of the party as a form of
insurance policy -- with voters asked to support the SLD to make sure
that Labour delivers on constitutional change. This suggestion appears
optimistic. It is difficult to see voters turning to the Liberal
Democrats to lever Labour into delivering on home rule in the tradition
of Archimedes -- the SNP is historically more suited to that task and
will probably pick up the votes of those seeking to put pressure on
Labour over devolution.
Therefore, the Scottish Liberal Democrats' constructive political role
within the Constitutional Convention over the past six years seems most
likely to go unrewarded by the Scottish electorate -- a poor reward
indeed for its active promotion of consensus politics.

HOCKEY:
GREAT Britain continued their excellent pre-Olympic qualifying
tournament form at Bisham Abbey yesterday when they beat Russia 4-0 in
the second Test, having won the first 5-0 on Tuesday.
Once again Scottish players had a major influence in Great Britain's
triumph. Two of the goals came from Pauline Robertson, while Susan
Fraser had a hand in three.
Fraser set up the opening score in 17 minutes. Her shot at a penalty
corner came off the bar and was diverted over the line by Robertson
before Jill Atkins converted a second corner two minutes later, with
Fraser setting up the chance.
Midway in the second half Robertson converted a cross from Jane
Sixsmith, who completed the scoring, with Fraser again the architect.

GOLF
SAM Torrance continues his marathon schedule when he heads a strong
British contingent at the Sarazen World Open starting here tomorrow. He
will be playing for the thirteenth successive week when he tees it up at
Chateau Elan in the scenic countryside about 70 kilometres from Atlanta.
''Each of these events I'm playing has its own importance, and I can
get myself up for every one of them,'' said Torrance, who goes straight
from Georgia to Asia for three more tournaments, starting with next
week's World Cup.
Despite enjoying the most successful year of his career, Torrance
believes his best golf is still ahead. ''I don't think this year is the

WHATEVER else he achieves in football, and there could be plenty to
come, Jimmy Nicholl will recall one moment in Munich with a wonderment
that he may well not again experience.
It was roughly 8.45pm on Tuesday in the Olympic Stadium, home of the
Bundesliga leaders, when he stole a glance at the giant electronic
scoreboards that glowed in the dark behind each goal. They read: Bayern
Munich 0, Raith Rovers 1.
Nothing much in anybody's Scottish football life will top that, even
if it was a scoreline that lasted only eight minutes, and Nicholl, from
the beginning of his team's maiden voyage into European football, has
been aware of the fairy tale aspects of Rovers' adventure.
He confessed, for instance, that he had a good look around the Olympic
Stadium before the kick-off, marvelling at its futuristic bearing, and
also stood on the touchline as his players came out, just to get the
''feel' of the occasion.
''Everything I had wanted for these players when we made it into the
UEFA Cup came true,'' he said. ''We were never going to win it, were we?
so what I wanted was a big occasion, a big stadium, a good crowd, and a
good show. I got the lot.
''There are times when you are a manager you forget what it was like
to take part in these games, and in any case with a big club you can get
a bit used to it and take it for granted. If I could, I would taken a
picture of that scoreboard. Who knows? Something like this may never
happen again.''
If most of his players also were on a high after having put up such a
decent show in the 2-1 defeat in Germany, they will know that they have
done their personal chances of progressing to other pastures and greater
rewards no harm. In fact, Nicholl acknowledged after the squad landed at
Edinburgh yesterday that an English club has been waiting for Rovers'
exit form Europe to come back with a bid for one of two players.
''The club say they will take either one and I expect them to be
speaking to me next week.'' Nicholl would not identify players or club
but Bolton Wanderers are believed to be the team, and Tony Rougier and
Colin Cameron the players.
Bolton have made inquiries about both, but may be willing to settle
for a #750,000 bid for one. That would seem likely to be Cameron on
Tuesday's showing, when he was much more effective than the man from
Trinidad and Tobago, although Rougier has impressed on other occasions.
Either way, Nicholl, who negotiated a #900,000 deal when Stephen
McAnespie went to the same club a few weeks ago, is in no hurry to sell.
The McAnespie cash, plus the takings from their European meeting with
Bayern have put the club in a more comfortable position, although the
rebuilding of the stadium will take priority for investment.
Nicholl also will have worked out in his mind where and how he will
replace one or more of his team with the aim of maintaining their rise
in the five years since he took charge. The manager will be the biggest
target for any major vacancies elsewhere in due course, but he diverts
that kind of speculation by insisting that he is on a contract until the
end of the year.
For the moment he will try to haul himself and his players away from
the sounds and sensations of the European big-time and re-direct them to
the domestic scene. ''We have to think about finishing high enough in
the league or even winning the Scottish Cup to get ourselves back into
Europe. What else can we do after this?'' They certainly had a very
special night to tell the grandchildren about.

THE Prime Minister did not set up the Nolan Committee because he had
some vague ideological hankering after more open and honest government.
It was established because there was serious and continuing evidence
that the conduct of some MPs, a majority of whom were Tories, fell far
short of the standard expected by both Parliament and people. It is
useful to remember this as the argument over what to do about Nolan
rumbles through the House of Commons before emerging in what will
undoubtedly be a revealing debate on Monday. The committee examining the
Nolan recommendations has agreed on a new ban on MPs tabling questions
or engaging in paid advocacy for outside interests. It is split between
the Tory majority and the Opposition members on the timing of the
reforms, but more particularly on Labour proposals that MPs should make
public their earnings from outside consultancy work. Why this should be
such a stumbling block for the Tory MPs involved is something of a
mystery. By agreeing to the ban on advocacy, even if they wish to
restrict its operation until a new Parliament, the Tory members of the
committee hoped to defuse demands for public knowledge of the sums of
money which they make from outside consultancies. They believe that if
disclosure on consultancies and clients is made, there is no need to
detail the amount which is paid.
There are several reasons why this is wrong. It ignores the fact that
the advocacy ban does not go as far as many MPs would like us to think,
and it flies in the face of the spirit of what Nolan was trying to
achieve and the information which is necessary for us to be reassured
about the conduct of our elected representatives. It breaches the spirit
of Nolan because anything which seeks to hamper or hinder the aim,
shared by both Lord Nolan and Mr Major, for transparency in Government
is clearly avoiding the core issues. A ban on advocacy is all very well,
but as Sir Teddy Taylor (who will vote in favour of the more stringent
Labour amendments on Monday) has said, it does not cover letters on
behalf of clients or meetings on their behalf with ministers. The exact
sum of money is also relevant. If an MP receives #10 per annum for his
consultancy with the Incorporated Association of Ratcatchers we, and
they, can be sure that he is not exerting himself much. If the
Ratcatchers pay him #5000 per annum we can be assured that they are up
to something and that he is energetic on their behalf. The knowledge of
the sum of money paid for services is obviously important in assessing
how and in what manner the MP conducts himself.
All of this is of considerable importance for Mr Major who is clearly
having some difficulty in imposing his views on his party. Lord Mackay's
proposals on divorce south of the Border are in difficulties and an
escape hatch on cost grounds has already been prepared for that retreat.
Mr Major made clear his wish that Nolan should be implemented, but the
committee's majority decision is obviously a response to back-bench
hostility. What is in danger of being forgotten is voter hostility. The
image of politicians is not high but nobody interested in functioning
democracy should take heart from that. Standards of behaviour must be
improved and be seen to be improved. Anything which dilutes that aim
should be rejected and it is Mr Major's duty to make this clear to his
party.

Paris manager aware of Celtic's 'extra man'.
PARIS St Germain arrived in Glasgow yesterday and appeared to hand
Celtic an immediate advantage when their manager, Luis Fernandez,
admitted that he worried over the prospect of walking out onto Celtic
Park tonight.
As he installed his players in their luxury hotel at Clydebank,
Fernandez demanded that they remain silent and refused to allow
interviews. The reason for that ban soon became evident as Fernandez
spoke for his squad.
''We know,'' he said, ''that tomorrow night we will be asked to walk
into hell. The Celtic manager, Tommy Burns, said we would face a night
of hell and we know that this will be true. It will be up to the players
to face that.
''We know about the Celtic supporters -- we saw some of them in Paris.
Now we will see them all, and the team has to be able to handle that
hostile atmosphere.
''My own view is that we have been to hell before in other grounds in
Europe, and we have come through these experiences. No doubt this will
be more difficult because of the fervour of the Glasgow supporters, but
we do have a one-goal lead and we will try to add to that from the
start.''
Fernandez believes that the way forward for his team in this European
Cup-winners' Cup second-leg clash is to try to kill off Celtic early in
the game.
''We do not want to sit on a one-goal lead,'' he said. ''That is
dangerous. What we have to do is go all out from the start and look for
a goal which will finish the tie. If we scored it would mean that Celtic
would have to score three goals, and they will not do that against us
even on their own ground.''
Fernandez believes that the single goal his team was able to score in
the Parc des Princes two weeks ago was crucial. It now allows them the
luxury of trying for an away goal, which he clearly believes will carry
the tie beyond the reach of Celtic.
While the Parisian side were relaxing yesterday afternoon, Celtic
manager Tommy Burns was fretting over the fitness of one of his most
important assets, the German, Andreas Thom.
It had seemed on Tuesday that Thom was going to be ready. But,
yesterday at Seamill, the injury had caused him further pain. There is a
burst blood vessel in his instep and Burns admitted: ''This is now
causing us some concern again. Earlier we thought that the problem had
cleared but it has flared up once more. Andreas will require further
treatment though we hope that he will be ready to play.''
Part of the treatment was that remedy which has helped so many Celtic
players through the years -- a paddle in the Clyde. Thom was to have two
stints at that yesterday and will probably have another this morning to
see if the healing waters can work for him.
Simon Donnelly has shaken off the virus which had struck him down at
the start of the week, and Thom was the solitary doubt for Burns last
night.
The German will be an influential figure if he plays, and he
recognises the importance of this game for the Parkhead club. ''I want
to play because I want to help Celtic create a new reputation in
Europe,'' said the German. ''When I was with Bayer Leverkusen we had a
lengthy run in this same competition and it lifted everyone at the club.
''The same will happen here and I believe that it can happen here.
Paris St Germain are a good team but we matched them two weeks ago in
France, and we will do better in front of our own supporters. They are
going to be so important.''
The role of the fans has never been stressed as much as it has been
over this game. Burns has talked of their fervour. Thom of their vital
contribution. And Fernandez and his players of the intimidating presence
they will bring to the tie.
There is no doubt that the people who have paid their money to make
this a sell-out will play their part. It is up to the players to match
their passion and protect that with the patience which their manager has
preached all week.
Celtic have a very real chance to reaching the last eight of this
tournament. If they can score early then the French side could collapse.
What they must avoid is carelessness in defence.
One mistake by the men at the back could wreck their dreams because,
like Luis Fernandez, I think that three goals would be too much for
Celtic on the night.
However, to score two is not beyond them and two should be enough to
take them into Europe's elite and restore their flagging continental
reputation.
* EVERTON manager Joe Royle insists his side can upset Feyenoord if
they rediscover the spirit which brought them success at Wembley last
season.
After a goalless draw at Goodison, Everton will need Dutch courage to
topple Feyenoord. ''I am quietly confident,'' said Royle. ''But we must
show the passion that has not always been there this season. It is a big
night for the club and a big chance to get our season going again.''

pilots of Spain's national airline Iberia. The financially-stricken

flights. The pilots, who plan three more 48-hour walkouts before
November 14, are demanding that pay cuts needed for a #650m rescue
package be annulled. Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock has still not
given the green light to the EU to bail out the airline.

I HAVE read Jill Crawshaw's series of articles with a mixture of
interest, despair, and surprise (October 30, 31, November 1).
I am surprised to read yet another no-hope article about what is a
very important industry to this country. It puts me in mind of the
highly critical and in most cases exaggerated reporting on other British
industries which people start to believe. As a result these industries
have practically ceased to exist.
Certainly self-appraisal should lead to improvement, but was Jill
Crawshaw, a perhaps over-sophisticated writer and traveller, the best
person to do this?
Her tone is patronising. Was she briefed to write an unbiased report
on Scotland's tourist facilities or was the intention all along to pick
holes and upset the natives? I read her quotes (English, French, and
Latin dictionaries in hand) and bits about all the other wonderful
places she has been, and can only conclude she's an awfully intellectual
lady telling us mere punters what it's all about.
My interest stems from the fact that I represent a group of small B&amp;B
guesthouse and self-catering operators, namely the Renfrewshire
Accommodation Group. Apart from our own small initiative in banding
together to pool our efforts as a group, we have received valuable help
from Renfrewshire Enterprise in hospitality and tourism training.
We know there is room for improvement and are doing a lot about it,
long before Jill Crawshaw came down to earth to tell us mortals what
sloppy sods we are.
As suntans are going out of fashion and wonderful film epics are
providing free publicity worldwide, Scotland is becoming the top of the
alternative hols pile. There is a vast core of people in this wonderful
industry that she has obviously missed out on, who will make success
happen.

I HAVE read with great interest Jill Crawshaw's article (October 30)
and I look forward to the sequels.
Thank God some one is brave enough to stand up and say what a lot of
the travel-trade profession knows to be true but hides it behind a
smart-look facade. I have for long made myself unpopular with the trade
because I believe that a large number of hotels and accommodation
establishments in the Highlands simply under-service and over-charge
their guests.
There is regrettably a small or perhaps not so small proportion of
business which thinks, ''Short season, get as much revenue for as little
output as we can''.
Jill Crawshaw should carry on the good work and blast these people off
the face of the tourism business. They do nothing to encourage repeat
business in the Highlands and that's our life-blood.
Having said that, there are some excellent businesses in the
Highlands. They are mostly small family units where it is of
considerable importance that their guests come back and back again. I
know personally of many that fall into this category.
As for Jill Crawshaw's comments on the tourist board, I say well done.
It is about time that someone put a sharp boot under their rear end.
They have come up with a grading classification scheme which is
excellent then they totally let it down because they simply look at the
contents of a place. They pay no attention to whether or not the bed may
be 25 years old or split new.
The local area tourist boards simply do not train their staff to a
level that we in the hotel trade would expect them to considering the
fees they charge.

WE were somewhat disappointed to read Jill Crawshaw's article on
Mallaig and its environs (October 31). While we cannot comment on the
reception she received at the Inverlochy House Hotel, or at Arisaig, we
are currently staying at Mallaig on business and find the welcome here
friendly and inviting.
Perhaps she did not appreciate when entering Mallaig that it is a busy
and important fishing port and as such storage facilities are necessary.
If she looked further than the port and round towards Knoydart, she
would have seen some of the most beautiful scenery in the west coast.
We are in Mallaig twice a year both in winter and spring and certainly
always look forward to renewing old friendships.

AS a businessman dependent on tourism for my livelihood I was sorry to
read about Jill Crawshaw's experiences (October 30 and 31).
However, her comments on Mallaig are unfair; yes, the welcome sign
does have a backdrop of buildings but these are new stores recently
built for the fishing fleet and small factory units which are being let.
The large recently painted fuel tanks are adjacent to the railway
station to allow decanting of fuel, again for the fleet.
Mallaig is not a typical pretty cove with one or two part-time
fishermen mending nets for the camera, surrounded by holiday homes, but
is one of Britain's major fishing ports.
If she had stayed during the week she would have had an unrivalled
experience watching all types of qualify seafood being landed, and then
seeing it processed in the fish factory.
Over the last few years, many people and organisations have spent much
time, effort, and money transforming dereliction left over from the days
when Mallaig was Europe's major herring port into thriving visitor
centres such as Mallaig Marine World and the Heritage Centre.
New buildings have been landscaped into the town to serve the
community, the tourist, and the fishing fleet alike.
I suppose it is always easier to be negative and, while we must take
on board some of her complaints, surely a more balanced article could
have been published.I am sorry her welcome was not typical, but I wonder
if the response she received from people was purely a mirror image of
her own.

CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE
ROUND-UP
BLACKBURN manager Ray Harford was upset on two counts last night after
his side's failure to beat Legia Warsaw ended their hopes of reaching
the quarter-final stage of the European Cup.
The defeat was bad enough for Harford, but Polish taunts that his side
lacked bottle for the challenge on hand went too far. ''It's not about
spirit, it's technique,'' he claimed.
Rovers had to win to stay alive in the qualifying group, but a
last-minute miss by Alan Shearer rendered their final two games, against
Spartak Moscow and Rosenborg of Norway, academic.
''We had our chances, enough chances but we didn't put them away,''
said Harford. ''We've got better -- at least a little bit better. We're
taking a little more care with our passing -- we're still not great,
very good or good even, but it has improved each game.''
In Switzerland, European champions Ajax were held 0-0 by Grasshoppers
of Zurich in Group D. This was the Dutch side's first slip after 15
consecutive victories in the Dutch league and European Cup and leaves
the group open with the second-placed team facing Juventus in the
quarter-finals.
Real Madrid also were held to a draw, 1-1 away to Ferencvaros, with
young striker Raul Gonzalez salvaging a point for the Spaniards after 74
minutes.
Florian Albert put Ferencvaros ahead after 36 minutes. The Hungarians,
recovering from successive beatings against Ajax and Real away, are
still alive six points adrift of the Dutch side but only three behind
the Spaniards.
In Denmark, Laurent Guyot was quick to give Nantes the lead against
Aalborg in their Group A match, and Nicolas Oudec made sure for the
French champions after 67 minutes. Panathinaikos and Porto drew 0-0 in
Athens.
* LENS scored three times in the first 11 minutes last night on the
way to a 4-0 home success against Chernomorets, of Ukraine, in a UEFA
Cup third-round tie in France, a win which takes the French side through
on aggregate.
They now joined Bordeaux and Lyon as French clubs to advance to the
final 16 teams in the competition. Strasbourg meets AC Milan tonight in
an attempt to make it four, although the Italian club has a 1-0
advantage.

How do I make more money? A new series of business breakfasts run by
Allan Gormley and a team of fellow industry experts at KPMG may help you
find the answers by sharing the problems
THERE are four main issues which all organisations face: money,
technology, people, and relationships.
Money -- how can I make more? Technology -- how do I use it to maximum
effect? People -- how do I motivate my workforce? Relationships -- can I
trust my partners?
* Money: It is a measure of both success and failure but oddly enough
organisations can never have enough. Whether as a large quoted
multinational or as a small single operation run from the garden shed
money dictates how and when we do our business.
Our goal, therefore, is to make money either for outstanding success
or for survival. Now that both the recession and mini-recession are over
(officially that is) this should be simple. So why are so many
organisations finding it difficult?
You can consider putting up your prices, pass on the increased costs
of raw materials, research and development, or labour, and ask the
consumer to pay a price which will provide a reasonable margin and allow
you to make money.
However, for most of us this is not possible because today's markets
are consumer-led, price-sensitive, and open to worldwide competition,
and most of us simply do not have the leverage to materially impact the
markets in which we operate.
So what can we do to increase working capital or cash flow?
We need to look internally rather than externally -- increase the rate
of innovation; decrease the time to market; reduce the supply chain;
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our staff.
In effect we need to review and redesign our own internal business
processes. What the gurus call BPR or business process redesign.
BPR, however, falls into a number of categories. Business
transformation which crosses functional boundaries will have the biggest
impact and the biggest benefits. But it also carries the biggest risk.
Departmental reorganisation is less risky, dealing with a smaller
functional area.
Workplace reorganisation provides scope for the smallest improvements
and consequently the least benefits. In many cases BPR becomes a
compromise with new technology.
* Technology: Harnessing new or existing technology is a prerequisite
for organisations needing increased efficiency to reduce their internal
costs and maintain their competitiveness. There is an enormous variety
of new technology in which to invest, all of which claims to have some
business benefit.
The other important factor concerning new technology is the rate of
change. Managers are often concerned that new technology is out of date
before it is implemented.
The important question is not so much the technology itself. The
question is how the tool can be used effectively within your
organisation to provide the information which empowers management to
make vital decisions. This is equally true of new systems, new
machinery, or improved communications.
* People:While new technology is one important factor in increasing
the productivity and efficiency within an organisation, it is the staff
themselves who will be responsible for the success or failure of the
business.
Their ability to accept change and to use the information afforded by
new systems is crucial.
Training and education provide staff with an opportunity not only to
come to terms with change but also provide the business with the
opportunity to listen to fears which may cause a much needed and
technically sound project to fail.
New technology brings the need for new skills. And this means that
management has to decide whether to reskill or recruit staff who can
provide the new opportunities for the business. In reality the decision
is usually a mixture of both, allowing business knowledge to be retained
while introducing new ideas.
* Relationships:All business is concerned with relationships, both
internal and external. As consumer markets become bigger it is no longer
acceptable for an organisation to provide only a small part of the
overall service or product. Consequently, external relationships in the
form of partnerships or joint ventures are playing an increasingly
important part in uniting today's business community.
One crucial factor in relationships is the ability to communicate --
not only technically by using compatible systems but also by discussing
ideas and information with other partners. This requires trust and is
one of the main reasons partnerships fail to provide the anticipated
benefits.
Important in any partnership is understanding both what you bring to
the relationship and your role in achieving the overall goal.
That goal, of course, is to make money.
It is with these issues in mind that we at KPMG are running a series
of breakfast workshops early next year. They have been run successfully
in London but this is the first time they will have been held in
Scotland.
The breakfast forums will allow management from different
organisations to discuss the type of issues they are facing and to
establish what others in similar or different markets are doing to
manage those particular issues.
Our experience in London is that directors attending the breakfasts at
the Ritz are keen to share their problems and solutions with others. The
same should apply in Scotland. We hope to see you there.

technology unit and comes from an industrial background.

A SHIFT towards acceptance that future financial support for
agriculture will be more dependent on environmental and social issues
was indicated yesterday by the National Farmers' Union of Scotland.
Union president John Ross, initiating a debate on environment policy,
forecast a gradual move from support based on current levels of
production towards the achievement of other objectives.
''Protection of the environment will be a major influence on future
farm policy,'' he told a council meeting at Ingliston. ''Only a fool
would ignore the message, the clear signals, given in the reformed CAP.
It incorporates a new focus -- a new emphasis -- on environmental
objectives.''
John Scott, convener of the union's hill farming committee, laid down
a marker that whatever changes were envisaged he would still expect
substantial support for farming in Scotland's less-favoured areas.
There would be a need for both social and environmental support, he
said. It was already acknowledged by governments throughout Europe that
targeted support, directed at those most in need, would be the way to
achieve cuts in CAP budgets, he added.
Mr Scott was rebuked by the union president when he used the
environment debate to express his fears about support for farming in a
devolved Scotland. He suggested that a UK Treasury, which he described
as hell-bent on reducing expenditure, might not be prepared to make Hill
Livestock Compensatory Allowances or Environmentally Sensititve Area
payments at the same level north of the Border if Scotland had its own
tax raising parliament.
He called for a high level committee to be set up within the union to
study the implications of constitutional change.
Mr Ross responded by emphasising that the NFUS was politically
neutral. ''Whether or not there is a devolved parliament in Scotland is
a matter of individual choice and it would be wrong for the union to
take sides in that debate,'' he said.
''As far as I am aware there is no political party saying they will
come out of Europe and the bulk of support for agriculture is European
Union support. The union will have discussions with whatever political
party is in power.''
If there was a need to discuss changes in the administration of the
country, the committee to discuss it would be the union's General
Purposes Committee, he emphasised.
The environment debate demonstrated abroad acceptance that farmers and
conservationists were likely to be working more closely together, but
there were some signs that old wounds had not healed entirely.
Ian Morrison, from Caithness, recalled that in his county
environmentalists had been described as ''green fascists''. Some changes
which had been implemented as conservation measures were now being
reversed. ''Someone once said it is difficult to be green when you are
farming in the red,'' he said.
0  The union leadership will draw up a working paper on future
environment policy in the light of yesterday's debate. That will be
discussed at branch and area level before a final version is brought to
the union's annual general meeting in Ayr for approval as a policy
document.
''We must get our thinking moving so that we, the farming community,
are in the driving seat,'' said John Ross.

BRIAN Wilson's article on events at the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama was overdue in highlighting the Victorian values
espoused by the management (October 27). As a former employee, staff
representative, and victim of the regime there (one of many), I welcome
the public spotlight being brought to bear on Mrs Fowler and her ilk.
Of greater and possibly more significant concern are the wider
questions: who runs the RSAMD and in whose interests do they govern?
Why is Scotland's premier higher education institution for the arts
seen as the personal preserve of a coterie of city businessmen, and to
whom are they accountable?
The silence from them is deafening. There are many former employees,
who have since exited stage left, still interested in what now
transpires and a wider audience among the general public awaiting the
final act.

AS a regular user of ScotRail's Glasgow-Aberdeen service, I'm used to
hearing all manner of excuses for trains being late. But the reason for
a 30-minute hold-up at Perth recently takes the biscuit. According to
the platform announcement the train had ''run out of fuel''.
Here's hoping a privatised ScotRail has no plans to diversify into air
travel.

IT'S important when The Herald covers medical stories such as tackling
suicide in the Highlands that it doesn't alarm or confuse its readers
with inaccurate reporting (October 20).
The conference in Inverness did not recommend that there should be a
reduction in the prescribing of Prozac.
What the Highland Health Board does recommend in its 15-point plan for
reducing suicide is the reduction of the prescribing of anti-depressants
that could be toxic in overdose. One of the advantages of Prozac is that
it is less toxic, and is the preferred anti-depressant for many GPs,
psychiatrists, and patients.
The spotlight on Prozac is unsettling for those who are prescribed it,
and, I'd have thought, exasperating for GPs who, like their patients,
will be bemused or alarmed by your inaccurate reference to it.

THE Savoy Hotel group has sold its Lancaster Hotel in Paris for #9.66m
to a consortium of French investors.
Savoy managing director Ramon Pajares will use the proceeds to
refurbish the London hotels and particularly the Savoy -- which needs it
-- and Claridges.
A marketing campaign to sell the Lancaster was launched last year in a
difficult Parisian tourist market. So to obtain near twice net asset
value for the property which made just #88,000 pre-tax in 1994 seems an
astute deal.

MARGARET Vaughan's profile of Mrs Helen Liddell seemed to lack true
objectivity in its treatment of the latter's involvement with Robert
Maxwell (October 25).
Maxwell, she wrote, ''turned out to be as fake as his Bri-Nylon hair .
. . Hindsight being a wonderful thing, when the old tyrant disappeared
overboard . . . (Mrs Liddell) was scalded with criticism for having
taken the Maxwell shilling''.
This implication -- that no-one could have doubted Maxwell's integrity
before the post-mortem revelations -- is quite misleading, as I am sure
Margaret Vaughan knows.
Maxwell was exposed as a fraud in the 1960s, and during the last 20
years of his life the unsavoury and unscrupulous manner in which he
conducted business was apparent to anyone who took an interest in
current affairs.
He avoided terminal public disgrace only through an endless series of
threats and legal actions.
Hindsight, therefore, has nothing to do with it. Maxwell had been
rumbled for years; only the details were lacking. The most interesting
question, to which the article gives no answer, is why a self-proclaimed
socialist chose to associate with this most sordid of capitalists.

JOHN McCaffer, one of rugby's most respected administrators and a
member of the SRU committee has resigned. He has done more for the lot
of the player than many others.
Last week in the Herald he said that he thought that the Five Nations
could be sponsored, and the Calcutta Cup could be a separate entity
outside the Five Nations and trademarked. The Diary understands this
prompted a phone call from the RFU to the SRU, and some wailing and
gnashing of teeth.
We just hope that the two things aren't related. Or are they?
''Scottish rugby needs a barney like a hole in the head right now,''
McCaffer told us. ''It would be a breach of my undertaking to the SRU if
I were to give my reasons, and very ungracious of me. I am still going
to enjoy my rugby.''
Honest to goodness. The world is supposed to be all about free speech.
Totalitarian states, where free speech is suppressed, are usually
crushed into dust like all of the other useless enterprises in the
world.
* GHK are to lose their best player, wing forward Ian Sinclair, to
Watsonians in the October player reshuffle. Sinclair shares a flat with
the Edinburgh club's scrum half Jamie Weston. ''He goes with the club's
best wishes,'' said GHK director of rugby Andy Little. ''I think he is
pound-for-pound the best wing forward in Scotland and we will miss
him.''
* NEWS from south of the Border reaches the Diary that, in true North
of England style, the food served to both the Scottish and Russian teams
after their Rugby League World Cup game at Featherstone was ethnic. The
official post-match food consisted of mushy peas and faggots. In the
pursuit of truth we will try to find out for you who the faggots were.
Perhaps they were specially brought up from Harlequins.
* WE SAT beside Phil Anderson, the president of Dalziel rugby club, at
a dinner on Friday night. ''Do you have a problem with needles?'' he
asked, just as we were tucking into our steak pie.
''No,'' we lied, wondering where this was all leading and then feeling
queasy when he pulled up his kilt and jabbed a syringe into his left
thigh. Our man is a diabetic.
Leaning to my left I pointed out what was happening to George McNeill,
the former professional sprinter, now assisting Jim Leishman at
Livingston, and brilliant after-dinner speaker. ''Oh my God,'' said
McNeill. ''Where does he think he is . . . the Paisley dinner?'' Thanks
for a great night, folks.
* MURDO MacLeod was good value at the same event. He told of a meeting
he had with an unnamed manager -- aw, what the heck, he said it was
Billy McNeill -- where the newly signed MacLeod was hoping to talk terms
with the great man. ''I'll tell you how it is,'' said McNeill. ''Monday
morning training, afternoon golf.
''Tuesday morning training, afternoon bookies. Wednesday morning
training, afternoon off. Thursday morning training, afternoon pub,
thursday night we see the women.''
''Er, Mr McNeill, I thought we were here to talk football,'' said the
fresh-faced MacLeod.
''Look,'' said McNeill. ''Are you gay or something?'' ''No,'' replied
MacLeod.
''Well, you won't enjoy Fridays, then, will you!'' replied McNeill.
* IN THIS month's Scottish Rugby magazine Rob Wainwright, the Scottish
captain, says that his worst rugby memory was sharing a room with Damian
Cronin. The latter, it appears, was the only person in the world who
found it possible to come into Wainwright's room at three in the morning
with a kebab, leave the meal uneaten, and then fall asleep and start to
snore immediately. Told you dreadful things happened on rugby tours.
Mind you, captains should be sorting these things out.
* MICHAEL Curle, of Waysiders Drumpellier, tells us of a dreadful
occasion that befell the club's over-50s team, aptly and rather cleverly
called the WD 40s, who were a man short just prior to leaving for a
tussle with the Stirling Wolfhounds. The Wolfhounds are a tough and
ornery bunch.
Like the evil, grown men they are, they commandeered a young lad
called Graham Moffat to play on the wing. Our young friend hadn't played
rugby before. No-one should have been too surprised therefore when, in
the enthusiastic throes of scoring a try, our newcomer crossed the
22-metre line, the try line, and then the dead-ball line, before running
on to a nearby pitch on which there was a game taking place -- all
without grounding the ball. The boy claimed the only rugby player he had
ever watched was Roger Baird.
''He said he didn't know he was supposed to touch the ball down over
the line,'' says Curle. ''It goes without saying that we weren't too
happy at the wee laddie. We normally fine folk for misdemeanours --- and
this was no exception. He had an expensive day did the boy.''
In the opinion of the Diary, this sums up ageism, cruelty, money, and
authority. Well done, lads!
* WE GIVE you an insight into the Peter Wright sending-off at Gala on
Saturday. It was eventually because he uttered one little four-letter
word at the bottom of the ruck when Ken McCartney gave the decision
against him. Contact the Diary and tell us what you think that little
word was. Now, it shouldn't be too difficult.
* AND finally, spare a thought for young Simon Hardie, of Bishopton,
who was forced to wear a blow-up sheep tied to a certain part of his
body after a recent game with the wild lads of Kintyre. Simon was last
seen lying under a car on Sunday morning. The driver claims to hold all
title to Simon after giving the nearest farmer a tenner for the sheep he
thought he knocked over. See this sheep-watching, it's very bad for you.

James Freeman reports on the undercover campaign against drug barons
THE threat to the lives of undercover officers infiltrating major drug
trafficking networks is very real. The Crown in Scotland was not
indulging in histrionics when they yesterday sought to have policemen
give evidence anonymously and hidden from the public in the High Court
in Glasgow.
The officers involved in giving evidence from behind the screens are
likely to come from England, and that may well be the key point in the
move to conceal their identities.
At the level of major drugs busts, there is now widespread
co-operation between forces north and south of the Border and increasing
liaison through the Scottish forces' own intelligence service allied to
the National Crime Intelligence Service which has a Scottish arm. If
current negotiations bear fruit the NCIS will, probably within a year,
have an enhanced presence here.
Co-operation is growing by the day to combat the now-global nature of
drug trafficking.
The drug squad officers attached to Scottish forces invariably go
up-front and give evidence in court -- often in courtrooms where the
public benches will harbour a who's who of the local drug trade,
listening and watching and filing away knowledge, the better to avoid
the pitfalls of detection in future. That is the price we pay for living
in an open, democratic system where justice is seen to be done.
In very major cases the police will have their own people in court
taking note of who is taking note, and so the intelligence game goes on.
In England, the price can be much, much higher. The advent of the
criminals' own database is very recent and the news has become common
knowledge among senior echelons of the police only in the past few
weeks, but there is no doubt that it is real.
The threats are also real, although no undercover officer has yet paid
the ultimate price, which might be expected if his or her infiltration
of one of the major trafficking organisations were discovered.
Infiltration or undercover work in Scotland is often undertaken by
officers from one of the central or regional resource units rather than
by regular drug squad officers who may be well known to a wide range of
criminals. It would not be unusual for Scottish officers to be seconded
to work undercover in England should the need arise to infiltrate a team
of Scottish criminals operating in one of the major English centres.
That co-operation also works the other way round.
The major difference is that the rules of disclosure in England are
now so sweeping that it is practically impossible for the Crown to have
the identity of an officer, or, for that matter, a vital police
informant, concealed from the defence. In a number of cases the police
themselves have withdrawn cases, allowing criminals to walk free, rather
than expose the identities of undercover officers or informants.
This galling experience has led to widespread discontent in English
police circles and to a degree of bitterness against the legal
profession in particular. The feeling has grown among the rank and file
that the criminals have been given the edge, thanks to the lawyers.
One English source has told The Herald that the so-called database run
by the criminals, which is computerised, may well derive much of its
information from criminal defence lawyers who are either constantly in
court, or about the courts, on behalf of clients and who daily monitor
the police witnesses who appear against them.
Information may also be reaching the criminals through people working
for the legal profession on the fringes, such as precognition agents or
private investigators. At the bottom end of the criminal legal trade
there is often little love lost between the two sides. Another likely
source of detailed information on undercover men could be bent police
officers, and senior people admit it is idle to pretend these do not
exist.
The officers directly in the firing line are likely to be men and
women from the Metropolitan Police's intelligence and undercover unit
where, it is widely recognised, the real expertise exists to target the
Mr Bigs, despite the fact that most police forces tend to go their own
way in this matter, partly from chauvinism.
Wherever the undercover cops come from their actions are subject to
guidelines laid down by the Home Office in England, the Scottish Office
here and the chief constables in the respective jurisdictions.

SCOTTISHPOWER has reshuffled the responsibilities of its executive
directors following the appointment of corporate affairs director Mike
Kinski as chief executive of its newly acquired subsidiary Manweb.
The boardroom reshuffle gives ScottishPower chief executive Ian
Robinson, 53, specific responsibility for generation, power systems and
energy supply.
Duncan Whyte, the longest serving member of the board and the only one
who has been there since privatisation in 1991, becomes executive
director for strategic development.
This is an effective promotion for Mr Whyte, who was once considered a
contender for the top job at ScottishPower before it went to Mr Robinson
in March.
Formerly responsible for energy supply, he now takes charge of
corporate strategy and new ventures, along with the non-core areas of
telecommunications and retailing.
Mr Whyte, 48, will also deal with international activities. This
recognises his leading role in preparing a bid for the Australian power
distribution company United Energy, which was dropped when ScottishPower
decided in July to go for Manweb instead.
Finance director Ian Russell, the man who steered through the
successful #1100m bid for Manweb, now takes charge of projecting
ScottishPower's public image as well.
Mr Russell, 42, adds information systems, corporate affairs and
procurement to his portfolio.
Ken Vowles, 53, will continue to supervise electricity generation
under the eye of the chief executive. But he also takes on fresh
responsibility for safety, technology, gas, and environmental matters.
Mr Kinski, 43, retains responsibility for personnel issues in
ScottishPower's 8000-strong labour force for the time being, despite his
move to Manweb's headquarters in Chester.
He is expected to impose to sharply reduce the 3000 workforce of the
new ScottishPower subsidiary, which distributes electricity in
Merseyside and North Wales.
* JOHN Baker, chairman of National Power, Britain's largest
electricity generator, is taking up a post as non-executive director of
drugs company Medeva.
Mr Baker is also a non-executive director of Royal Insurance and
chairman of the World Energy Council.

A SCOTS fertility specialist last night called for a national register
of voluntary egg donors after the activities of an agency offering up to
#1100 for human eggs were exposed.
The heads of licensed clinics are banned from buying eggs under laws
regulating fertility treatment. But a legal loop-hole has meant the
London Gynaecology and Fertility Centre in Harley Street can refer women
who want a baby to an agency which pays ''human hens'' to provide eggs.
Eggs sold by donors are implanted by clinic head Professor Ian Craft
for a fee of #4000.
Details of the loop-hole emerged following an investigation by BBC1's
Here and Now programme and broadcast last night.
A shortage of eggs means that women may have to wait up to five years
for a donor. The programme shows a nurse from the centre telling a
potential client that she can ''speed things up'' by going through an
organisation called Hope.
Mrs Katherine Bristow runs Hope from a house in Par, Cornwall, and has
around 80 woman egg donors on her books. Would-be parents pay Hope #250
to register and a further #850 for eggs from a donor.
However, mother-of-two Mrs Bristow said: ''We are not making any
money. We are just helping people who need help. We are doing very
important work helping a lot of people. If people think that is
ethically wrong, then that is up to them.''
Dr Robin Yates, director of the Assisted Fertility Unit at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary, said payment was not illegal if the patient brought
forward her own donor. Normally donors were paid expenses.
''The whole question of egg donation is a difficult one. Our programme
is limited by the number of ladies coming forward to donate, and I think
more people would come forward if they knew how to go about it.
''The whole idea of a central register of donors would be a very
attractive one. Having only four centres in Scotland, we could very
easily set up a system where there was one centre collecting the eggs.''
Dr Yates's unit carries out approximately 20 procedures a year
involving donor eggs. Typical cases include women who have been treated
successfully for cancer but at the expense of the loss of their ovaries,
younger womens who have suffered premature menopause, or where
conventional IVF has proved unsuccessful.
''Donors are altruistic ladies who have completed their families, but
they have to be under 35 years of age -- so that leaves you a pretty
small window,'' he said.
Patients who come for IVF treatment in Glasgow with their own donor
are referred to the Nuffield Hospital -- which collaborates with the
Royal and Glasgow University in the city's IVF programme -- to have it
done privately.
To have it done on the NHS entails waiting in the queue for an
anonymous donor to become available.
''It is done totally anonymously at the Royal Infirmary. I am happier
with the concept of anonymity. You avoid the kind of problems that might
arise later if the donor and patient know each other,'' said Dr Yates.
Ms Ruth Deech, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority, which regulates treatment, told the BBC programme: ''Clearly
one does not want egg donors that are motivated solely by the money,
because then there might be a problem about medical abuse.''

THE jockeying for position to see who will succeed John Ross as
president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland began in earnest
yesterday, writes ROBERT ROSS.
First to declare himself as a contender last week was livestock
convener Stewart Whiteford. Yesterday it was the turn of animal welfare
convener George Lyon to intimate his candidacy under ''any other
competent business'' at the council meeting.
Mr Lyon promised ''a modernising agenda, seeking to build on the
politcal strengths of the union to enable it to face the major
challenges and opportunities which lie ahead as we move into the next
century''.
Senior vice-president Sandy Mole made no formal statement but
comfirmed at the lunchtime press conference that he would be seeking
election.
Aberdeenshire's Maitland Mackie, a former vice-president, also
indicated, after the meeting, that he would be prepared to stand if he
were asked by a group which shared his views on the future path the
union should take.
Mr Mackie's comments came in the wake of the debate on the setting up
of a new public affairs division at union headquarters.
While supporting the new division he argued that the union as a whole
had to have an operational plan which was well equipped to manage
change. A business plan setting out the purpose of the union was
required, he said. ''We need to decide what areas of work the union
should be in and how best to use our #1.5m resources to deliver the
purpose of the union.''
Union president John Ross gave Mr Mackie a blunt response: ''The
purpose of this union is to defend the political and economic interests
of its members.''
Mr Mackie came back, however, insisting that a mission statement for
the union could not be drawn up ''on the hoof'' from the top table.
''There is a huge amount of work to do in small groups to set this union
on the road effectively and efficiently for the next 10 years,'' he
said.
The council agreed to a 4% increase in dues for next year plus a #10
payment to cover the funding of the new public affairs division.

LOCAL government is important to us all. Whether it is helping to
educate our children or caring for our elderly, its activities affect
our daily lives far more directly than those of central government.
Local government is unglamorous and largely unloved but its ability to
deliver high quality services at good value for money is vital to our
wellbeing. Despite all the criticisms levelled at councillors, the vast
majority of them offer sterling public service for little or no personal
profit; they are our democratic representatives and accountable to us
unlike the quango state. We can turn the local government rascals out in
a way we cannot do to health board appointees or the men and women who
now control our water supplies.
Today the Great and the Good -- the power brokers and the opinion
formers among our local politicians will all be found at The Herald's
''Challenge of Change'' conference in Edinburgh. Councillors by and
large like conferences and on this day in November they have plenty to
talk about. Behind them are months of unprecedented upheaval as regions
and districts have begun a forced metamorphosis into the 32-strong
structure of unitary councils decreed by the Conservative Government.
Less than four weeks ahead are the financial realities of the national
Budget with the fledgling councils caught up in the wider power play of
an unpopular Government determined to squeeze public spending and
deliver tax cuts.
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch intends to offer a
review of the process of reorganisation from the Scottish Office
perspective when he addresses The Herald's conference. Our own review
would suggest that the standards of behaviour by some of those involved
have not been of the highest order. The exercise of disaggregating large
regions like Strathclyde and Lothian and flattening the two-tier
structure into one has offered many opportunities for region v district
power grabs and the settling of old scores when it has come to making
senior staff appointments. Labour occupies the Establishment role in
Scottish local government and its leaders must ensure its local
representatives never again act in a way which lays them open to
damaging claims of dispensing unfair patronage and jobs for the boys.
With the Conservatives denied power in any of the new councils, Labour
can afford to act generously towards Opposition groups who should be
allowed to make a real contribution to the running of the authorities.
An equal responsibility lies with Scottish Office ministers to try to
raise their rhetoric above petty points scoring and conduct a meaningful
public dialogue with local government.
The early days of Mr Forsyth's tenure looked promising with his
apparent desire to give responsibilities back to local councils and
perhaps remove budget capping. But at the moment it has all ended in
tears with ever more strident attacks from Mr Forsyth and Mr Kynoch over
what they perceive to be too many councillors being paid too large
special allowances and the engagement of too many highly paid officials
to run over-bureaucratic structures. Unfortunately the economic omens do
not look auspicious for a future rapprochement. Everyone knows it is
going to be the tightest of spending rounds with a forced shift from
national to local taxation to help the Government fund tax cuts. In many
cases council reserves have been spent to keep council tax down in an
electoral year and they face a third year of funding staff pay rises
from efficiency savings. A huge rise in council tax bills will be the
worst possible public relations start for the new authorities and for
the Government which created them.

ROB Wainwright will, indeed, captain Scotland against Western Samoa at
Murrayfield in just over a fortnight's time, but the side he will lead,
with three new caps plus that old stager A N Other included in the
ranks, has about it more than a whiff of experimentation.
The cap debutants are Stuart Reid, Jim Hay, and Rowen Shepherd at,
respectively, No.8, hooker, and full back.
It could be argued that new right winger Michael Dods could be added
to that list because, despite a couple of cap outings in weakened
Scotland sides against Argentina last summer (both at full back), his
only previous experience in front of a Murrayfield crowd lasted all of
60 seconds as a temporary replacement for Gavin Hastings against Ireland
that same year.
Reid's promotion to the senior side at the age of 25, after an
apprenticeship which seems to have gone on forever and which has
included five A caps, three B caps and captaining the Development side
in the second Test against Zimbabwe this summer, is richly deserved
after a season of barnstroming displays.
However, his elevation has come at the expense of Bath's Eric Peters,
who had such a good Five Nations but who, perhaps, did not quite come up
to the standards he had set himself in the spring during the World Cup
in South Africa. His omission, nevertheless, represents a major
surprise.
Yesterday, SRU director of rugby Jim Telfer said that Reid was in the
side because he had been playing ''very well'' and not because Peters
was suffering from a surfeit of second-team rugby at Bath.
''In fact, Eric has, maybe, played more first XV rugby this season
than he did last season when he was a regular for Scotland. We have
weighed up the two players and at the end of the day it comes down to a
selection choice,'' he said.
Reid, a policeman in Edinburgh, was, of course, delighted by his
selection but he, too, had not altogether expected it to come at the
expense of Peters. ''I thought that if I had a chance at all then,
maybe, it would have been at blind-side wing forward, but perhaps there
would have been concerns about the blend there.
''I've had a nerve-racking night. Jim Telfer phoned me, but I was
working and didn't sleep much waiting for the letter to arrive this
morning, because I didn't know whether he had phoned to say I was in or
out. Now that I'm in the side, I have to make sure that I stay there
and, more importantly, that we win,'' said Reid.
The A N Other listed in the team-sheet is keeping the tight-head prop
berth warm for Peter Wright. The Boroughmuir captain, sent off while
playing against Gala at the weekend, is expected to know his fate within
a matter of days.
Telfer also confirmed yesterday that the appointment of Wainwright as
captain was, initially, being done on a one-match basis. ''I'd like to
think, though, he will do it well and we'll see how it goes after
that.''
Wainwright declared: ''There has been a lot of speculation but now the
selection is out of the way, I can get on with the job. It is a huge
honour and a huge responsibility.''
He has captained Scotland B and was to have been in charge in
Argentina last summer before injury intervened. He added: ''I've not got
a great deal of captaincy experience, but I'll be hoping to learn as I
go along.''
In another novel twist, no replacements have been named for the match
and none will be named until after the A team have played the Samoans at
Hawick on Sunday, November 12 just six days before the Murrayfield Test.
The Samoans, weakened as they are by defections to rugby league, will,
none the less, represent no mean opponents for Scotland and for the
other sides who play them. They arrive in Edinburgh today just before
the make-up of the Scotland A team is announced. Team:
R J S Shepherd (Melrose); M Dods, G P J Townsend (both Northampton), A
G Shiel (Melrose), K M Logan (Stirling Co); C M Chalmers, B W Redpath
(both Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath), J A Hay (Hawick), A N Other, G W
Weir (Melrose), D F Cronin (Bourges), R I Wainwright (West Hartlepool),
S J Reid (Boroughmuir), I R Smith (Gloucester).
Referee -- T Henning (South Africa).

BRITISH Assets Trust, the flagship of fund management group Ivory &amp;
Sime, appears to be back on track after major surgery.
Although the #673m investment trust failed to attain its objective of
achieving a total return in excess of the All-Share index in the 12
months to end-September, it did generate a greater return during the
nine months which followed shareholder approval of its controversial
restructuring plans late last December.
For the 12 months, British Assets' total return of 16.6% trailed one
of 18.5% on the All-Share. However, in the nine months to September, its
total return of 17.1% was ahead of its benchmark index's 16.7%.
Ivory &amp; Sime director Gordon Neilly said yesterday: ''One swallow
doesn't make a summer but I think we are heading in the right
direction.''
After shareholders approved British Assets' restructuring plans back
in December, Mr Neilly acknowledged that the clock had been ticking on
the Edinburgh-based fund management group's handling of its flagship
trust.
However, approval to convert 16% of British Assets' Ordinary shares
into non-income growth shares has enabled the trust to move to a
significantly less-demanding yield and focus on capital growth as well
as income.
The yield on the portfolio, relative to that on the All-Share, was
reduced from 116% to 106% between January and end-September.
A fourth interim dividend of 1.27p takes the total payout to 4.555p,
up 4%. With the retail price index advancing 3.9%, British Assets has,
therefore, made good on its promise to produce real dividend growth for
Ordinary shareholders.
Earnings per Ordinary share leapt from 4.1p to 4.62p, finally covering
the dividend, as a result of the conversion of some Ordinary shares to
growth shares.
British Assets' story is similar to that of its #386m sister trust,
Investors Capital, which last week signalled it was back on form after a
parallel restructuring. British Assets' 65% stake in Investors Capital
will be reduced to zero during the next five years.
During the 12 months, British Assets' net asset value advanced 11.4%
to 110.15p, while the All-Share rose 14.7%.
The UK accounts for 65.6% of British Assets' portfolio, with 19.5% in
North America, 6.6% in continental Europe and 6.8% in the Far East.

DISAPPOINTING interim results from superstore group J Sainsbury were
expected but, coupled with cautious comments, they led to the shares
sinking 21p to 403p.
In the six months to 23 September group pre-tax profits inched up just
1.5% to #450.9m. Sales were 11.1% ahead at just over #7000m, but on a
like-for-like basis taking into account higher than expected food price
inflation of 4.5%, sales dropped.
Profits growth was held back by costs associated with introducing its
Savercard customer loyalty card in more than 200 stores, equivalent to
0.3% of sales, initiatives to improve customer service, more store
refurbishments and higher marketing and advertising expenditure
associated with the ''Everyone's Favourite Ingredient'' campaign.
Chairman and chief executive David Sainsbury remains sceptical about
the long-term benefits of customer loyalty cards in food retailing. He
sees such cards ''as a tactical rather than a strategic marketing
tool''.
He added that while these changes were costly in the short term,
''they contribute to a sustainable basis for growing trade''. However,
he added that the sales performance has ''not been good enough''.
Product innovation is seen as playing an important part in the
rejuvenation of Sainsbury's supermarkets. More than 500 new products
were launched in the first half including Indulgence ice cream, ranges
of Thai and Oriental ready meals, Indiana Gold lager, speciality
sausages and fresh salad dressings. A further 300 products were
reformulated or redesigned.
Customers are highly price conscious and so in September Sainsbury
extended its small range of economy own brands to sixty products. These
provide low prices, basic quality and have a unifying turquoise and
yellow design.
At the opposite end of the market, Sainsbury has an excellent
reputation for its own brand goods. It has taken on the big premium
brand manufacturers and produced its own range of products which
significantly undercut the well known brands. It has already had great
success with its Classic Cola drink and Novon detergent range.
At the beginning of October its premium pet food sub brands Paws for
cats and Scout's for dogs was introduced. Just recently the TOPS range
of dental products was launched.
Sainsbury's retail subsidiaries, notably the Homebase DIY business,
continue to prosper, providing a welcome counterbalance to the
supermarkets business. Homebase continued to outperform in a difficult
DIY market. Texas Homecare, acquired at the start of the first half,
performed worst than expected and lost #7.5m. Sales were 12.5% below
last year but they are now on an improving trend and Texas is breaking
even.
Range integration with Homebase starts this month with all stores
transferring to the Homebase livery in the first half of next year.
The #290m acquisition price for Texas is currently the subject of
arbitration. Sainsbury isseeking a discount in view of the company's
performance . Sainbury remains convinced of the long-term potential of
the business, particularly in view of the stricter planning environment.
In the years ahead, the group Sainsbury expects a significant increase
in cashflow.
Sainsbury's cover has been 2.5 times in the past. In future, the
company hopes to pay dividends 3% higher than earnings per share growth
per annum.

South Schools 0, President's XV 21
A SOLID display by their powerful pack earned the President's XV
victory over South Schools in what was effectively a trial match last
night at Poynder Park in Kelso. But other than some effective forward
play, the selectors who met after the game to pick the teams for the
Scottish Schools trial would not have gained a great deal of
information.
Among the President's pack likely to feature in the trial are Torquil
Gordon-Duff, the Gordonstoun loose-head prop, one of five forwards from
the Morayshire school.
Assuming that Fergie Gladstone, who packed down alongside Peter
Phillips, the son of Princess Anne, is an automatic choice, the only
other Gordonstoun player who has a good chance of trial selection is Tom
Lightoller, who varied his game at stand-off splendidly to test the
South defence fully.
The President's XV led 7-0 at half-time through a try by right wing
Tony Politakis from driving play by the pack. Stand-off Lightoller
converted and added the extra points to second-half tries by
Gordon-Duff.

TWO other top-level departures at Dunedin Fund Managers resulted in
the intervention of its major shareholder, British Linen Bank Group, and
the subsequent resignations of the investment management house's
chairman and deputy chief executive.
It was revealed yesterday that the resignations of board members Nigel
Barry, head of Edinburgh-based Dunedin's Pacific operation, and Peter
Tait, head of the European arm, proved to be the final straw as far as
British Linen was concerned.
After the bank finally stepped in late last week, deputy chief
executive Alan Kemp resigned with immediate effect. Chairman Hamish
Leslie Melville, who is also chairman of the National Trust for
Scotland, will leave in two months.
The departures of Mr Kemp and Mr Melville were announced on Monday but
those of Mr Barry and Mr Tait, which prompted British Linen's decision
to bring Dunedin to heel, were not made public at that time.
British Linen deputy chief executive Sandy Nicol confirmed yesterday
that the chain of events which led to the bank's intervention had begun
with the departure of Dunedin investment director Gordon Anderson, who
was replaced by Richard Muckart from rival Ivory &amp; Sime in July.
It is believed that Mr Barry and Mr Tait intend to join Mr Anderson in
setting up a new fund management operation. It is unlikely they would
have made this decision without being relatively confident of taking
some of Dunedin's US pension fund clients with them.
British Linen's intervention also followed the resignations of two
senior members of Dunedin's marketing team in Chicago, although the bank
yesterday said the departure of one was unrelated to the other
resignations within the fund management group.
Mr Nicol said: ''We felt we had to step in. It very quickly became
apparent that the resignations had resulted from clashes in management
style among the senior management of Dunedin.''
The loss of so many key personnel must be a major blow to Dunedin,
which with #5600m of funds is the second-largest investment management
group in Scotland next to Baillie Gifford.
British Linen chief executive Eric Sanderson, who has stepped into the
breach until a new executive chairman is found for Dunedin, now has the
unenviable task of persuading clients not to move their funds.
Dunedin is the largest manager of North American money in Scotland. It
manages nearly #2000m for US pension funds, which could switch their
allegiance almost overnight, possibly to a new operation set up by
Dunedin rebels.
Mr Sanderson, who has been devoting his time to the Dunedin situation
during the last few days, flew to the US yesterday.
He may be trying to stem any bleeding of North American funds by
reassuring Dunedin's clients there that it still has a strong team in
spite of the string of departures.
Mr Nicol said: ''We believe that the team that is (still) there is
just as good as any team we have ever had.''
Dunedin also manages nearly #2000m of investment trust funds and
almost #1000m for the Bank of Scotland's pension fund. The remainder of
funds under management comprise venture capital, unit trusts and private
client money.
British Linen Bank, a subsidiary of Bank of Scotland, holds a 50.5%
stake in Dunedin, with the remainder owned by its Edinburgh, Worldwide,
Income Growth and Smaller Companies investment trusts.

Scotland Under-21 25,
New Zealand Youth 16
SCOTLAND scored a convincing and satisfying victory over their New
Zealand counterparts at Riverside Park, Jedburgh, last night with a
cohesive display which was revenge of sorts for the 25-21 Murrayfield
defeat in 1988, when last the two sides met.
In a game strewn with penalties, which made a nonsense of any plan to
play continuity rugby, the young Scots maintained the progress made last
season, when the Under-21 side defeated Wales and logged their first win
at this level since 1986.
Never mind the fact that the Scots were outscored 2-1 on the try
count, they were by far the better side.
The highlight of the Scottish display was a sparkling try six minutes
into the second half by Nottingham winger Steve Reed. The ball was
transferred at pace via Beveridge, Gilmour, and Bulloch before Reed
touched down.
The Scotland stand-off Chris Richards, on his home patch, was the main
provider of Scotland's points with a personal haul of 20, from six
penalty goals and a conversion.
Graeme Beveridge, the young Boroughmuir scrum-half, was once again one
of the most influential players afield and went a long way to enhancing
his already growing reputation. The Scotland skipper Graham Dall, plus
Gordon Bulloch and Scott Murray, were also prominent in a strong
Scotland pack.
New Zealand's points came from tries by flanker John Thomas and lock
Norman Maxwell, plus two penalty goals from stand-off David Holwell, but
this was a fine performance by the young Scots.

UNSCRUPULOUS food wholesalers are undermining the Scottish smoked
salmon industry by falsely labelling other inferior types of fish as the
genuine article, according to the Scottish Salmon Smokers' Association.
The association says #50m to #100m of cheaper Norwegian smoked salmon
and Danish smoked trout is sold each year falsely labelled as Scottish
fish.
Norwegian smoked salmon is 20% to 40% cheaper than Scottish smoked
salmon and is generally regarded as being less delicate in flavour.
Since every #100,000 of lost turnover represents at least one person's
job in Scotland, the association reckons this fraud could be costing the
local salmon industry between 500 and 1000 jobs.
Association member Andrew Lane, who is managing director of Loch Fyne
Oysters near Cairndow, said he believed half the slices of pink fish
sold as Scottish smoked salmon in the UK and abroad were counterfeit.
''It is a bit like selling ersatz whisky,'' he protested.
The association, whose members sold #57m of genuine Scottish smoked
salmon last year, accused some dishonest UK producers of colluding with
wholesalers to perpetuate the fraud.
''Business has reached such a brazen level that first-class smokers in
Scotland are now being approached by fraudulent dealers inviting them to
participate in deception,'' it said.
However, association chairman Andrew Bing declined to give details of
specific cases where he believed this had happened.
Mr Bing, who is smoked salmon manager at Montrose fish merchants
Joseph Johnston, appealed for government action to clamp down on
counterfeiters.
Sales of counterfeit Scottish smoked salmon were particularly
prevalent in Continental Europe, especially in France and Italy, he
added.
''I think this problem is outside Scotland where people are trading on
the good name that we have and labelling their packs up as Scottish even
if they have never seen these shores,'' he said.
Mr Bing urged the authorities to fight mislabelling of Scottish salmon
with the same energy they devote to protecting Scotch whisky.
Noting that 40% of all smoked salmon sales take place during the
run-up to Christmas, he said: ''The vast majority of smokers are
enjoying most of their sales over the next eight weeks.''

BRIAN Moore's 64-cap England career could be over after manager Jack
Rowell yesterday discarded him for the Test against world champions
South Africa on November 18.
Moore was omitted for a couple of low-key autumn internationals during
the 1990s, but his absence for England's biggest home match under
Rowell's reign is ominous.
Uncapped Bristol hooker Mark Regan takes Moore's place, but Rowell has
stayed with known quantities in other areas of the team, including
finally reappointing Will Carling as captain.
Rowell, who replaces retired half-backs Rob Andrew and Dewi Morris
with Mike Catt and Kyran Bracken as well as recalling flanker Andy
Robinson after six years, said of Moore: ''He asked if he has a future
in the set-up and I told him to rediscover his form.''
Regan, who has represented England at all levels below Tests,
declared: ''No-one is going to take this shirt off me. I have fought
like hell to get it and I intend to earn more.''
Rowell hesitated until the last minute before officially renaming
Carling as leader, but still lavished praise on him yesterday. ''Carling
has relaunched his form,'' said Rowell. ''In my time as manager he has
improved as a captain. He is playing some of the best rugby of his
career.''
If Carling stays in charge to the end of the 1996 Five Nations'
Championship, he will have led his country in a world record 59
internationals.
Jonathan Callard is restored to full-back after being dropped --
despite match-winning goalkicking performances -- when England were
tryless for three matches two seasons ago.
Rowell's other change is the selection of Wasps centre Damian Hopley
out of position on the right wing, with World Cup wings Tony Underwood
and Ian Hunter both injured. Team:
J B Callard (Bath); D Hopley (Wasps), J C Guscott (Bath), W D C
Carling (Harlequins), captain, R Underwood (Leicester); M C Catt (Bath),
K P P Bracken (Bristol); J Leonard (Harlequins), M Regan (Bristol), V E
Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C Bayfield, T A K Rodber (both
Northampton), B B Clarke, R A Robinson (both Bath). Replacements: P R
DeGlanville (Bath), D Pears (Harlequins), M Dawson (Northampton), G C
Rowntree (Leicester), R G R Dawe (Bath), L Dallaglio (Wasps).

YOUR report, Algerians unheard of since deportation, depicted the
plight of, among others, Gordana Vasic who was having difficulty finding
a job which would utilise her linguistic and librarian skills (October
26).
I am happy to report that, after a year on the Wise Group's employee
status programme, where unemployed people are given training, work
experience, and a real wage, Gordana has found a job with the University
of Strathclyde Library which matches her skills.
Her success in finding suitable employment offers hope to other
refugees trying to integrate into Scottish society; that, with a
considerable amount of hard work, it is possible to find a job that
matches the skils and experience they amassed in their native countries.
It should also present a reminder to employers that refugees possess
skills and experience which can be of real value to them.

WHITBREAD is now the most rapidly expanding retail group in Britain
with more than two new outlets being opened each week and the rate
accelerating. This has come through in half-time turnover, which has
risen 8.5% to #1327m. Half of the rise is due to these openings and the
rest to organic growth.
Pre-tax profits moved ahead a similar proportion to #158m,
disregarding asset sales, with a powerful performance from Whitbread
Inns and from restaurants and leisure.
The #197m acquisition of David Lloyd Leisure made no contribution, nor
did the #183m purchase of the 16 Marriott Hotels. Mr Lloyd said
yesterday that he was looking to open a new club at Hamilton, with
building beginning next year, and possibly one in Bearsden. Meanwhile,
he is waiting for planning permission for an opening near the Gyle in
Edinburgh. The existing Renfrew club now has 3700 members.
Altogether Whitbread opened 53 new outlets in the half year to August,
with a total of 110 planned for the full year. These will cost about
#200m out of planned expenditure of #300m -- the balance goes on the
refurbishment of the existing assets.
Throughout the business, it is a story of increasing market share in
almost all activities.
Whitbread Inns, which is seeing a new Brewers Fayre opened each week,
raised profits by 13% to #67.2m thanks to rapidly expanding food sales,
while restaurants and leisure added 15.2% to #35.6m. That was despite
another disappointing performance from Pizza Hut where margins have been
eliminated by competition -- it has taken an #8m promotion campaign to
try to clawback business to adequate levels of profitability.
In contrast, the Travel Inns saw occupancy and achieved yield well
ahead -- a 300-bedroom unit is being built off Lothian Road in
Edinburgh.
The 2890-strong pub estate held level in profit terms despite a 5%
fall in actual outlets. It is planned to reduce the number to 2200 by
the end of next year, with about two thirds of the surplus properties
already on their way out to pub companies and the like.
Bad debts in the tied estate are running at about #5m annually.
Hot weather had less of a beneficial impact than expected on the
brewing side. It ran short of capacity and had to resort to imports of
Stella Artois and Heineken as well as contract bottling.
Whitbread achieved its highest ever UK beer market share at 13.9% with
overall volume ahead by 6.3%. The highly competitive take-home sector
jumped 14.2%.
Given the strength of its brands, it seems unlikely that chairman Sir
Michael Angus and chief executive Peter Jarvis will now consider selling
off the brewing activities. They may instead be inclined to go the other
way.
Not only is there the perennial question of Allied Domecq's Carlsberg
Tetley being sold off, but both Vaux and Greene King are believed to be
open to any reasonable offer for their brewing activities.
Debt is insignificant with gearing at end-August of just 12.5%.
Market reaction was to push the shares ahead by 9p to 629p where they
yield a likely 4.4% on a probable dividend total of 22p after the
interim was raised 7.5% to 5.75p. Profits excluding exceptional items
should improve to about #280m for a price earnings ratio of about 14.5,
which is cheap for such a high quality stock.

A REVOLUTIONARY health centre, which paves the way for patients to
receive complementary medical treatment from the NHS, has opened in a
former Aberdeen mansion.
The Total Health Centre will offer a wide range of treatments
including an alternative approach to traditional medicine.
It is planned to instal a doctor's surgery and dental practice early
next year.
A spokesman for the centre said it was hoped that GPs would take
advantage of the facility by referring patients for treatment not
normally available on the NHS.
Centre director Lynne Boyd claimed it was the only centre in the UK
offering homeopathy, hypnotherapy, acupuncture, herbalism, massage,
aromatherapy, and a relaxation floatarium under one roof.
''We are a Scottish registered charity which uses its profits to
subsidise patients referred by social workers who could not otherwise
afford the treatments. It will be a health farm in the city.
''We aim to treat the cause of ill health, rather than just the
symptoms. We will care for the mind and spirit as well as the body.
Don't underestimate the feel-good factor. We encourage the body to
assist in its own healing.''
A spokesman for Grampian Health Board said it did not encourage
doctors to pay for complementary medicine.
However, GPs in the region have had a say in the design of the centre.
Professor Edzard Ernst of Exeter University said that although legally
doctors can refer patients for complementary medical treatment such as
osteopathy, the services are not yet widely available on the NHS.

I READ with interest Jill Crawshaw's article on Scottish tourism
(October 30). I have been briefly in my native city and country for the
month of October to celebrate my father's eightieth birthday.
It is difficult to convey fully my disappointment and frustration in
tracking information on a return bus or train/bus trip from Glasgow to
Jedburgh.
However, I present to you the series of events that should never have
occurred with the hope that your excellent newspaper can influence the
mystical powers that be.
First I visited Strathclyde Transport in St Enoch Square. ''Sorry,''
was the reply, ''we only do Strathclyde.''I was given a phone number for
Lothian Transport. I phoned and was told to phone Edinburgh Regional
Council, but I had no success. I walked to Queen Street station but they
only had railway information.
I walked to Buchanan Street bus station but had no success, although I
was given a directory inquiry number for a bus company in Edinburgh. The
line was engaged.
I remembered seeing a tourist information sign in St Vincent Street so
headed off. They had the information I needed and gave me a photocopy,
almost illegible, of the Edinburgh-Jedburgh timetable but only gave me
rough directions from Waverley Station to the bus terminus.
The train ride to Edinburgh was excellent and I headed off to the bus
station with a Big Issue seller keeping me on course.
At the ticket office I waited in the queue, then was told the office
was for long-distance not local buses. The office sign says: ''Tickets
-- all destinations''. I was annoyed and the sales person became stroppy
but he directed me to another office. There I was told I could buy my
ticket on the bus.
The bus took us all the way to Kelso. When I asked the driver if there
was a connecting bus to Jedburgh, he said I should have changed at St
Boswells. No-one had told me to change. The driver then said I could get
a bus after 3pm -- over an hour later.
But I had arranged with my Jedburgh friend to go to Hawick for the
Hawick-Stirling County match. I phoned and told my friend's son the
predicament. He ran to the Jedburgh bus terminus to advise his father of
our Kelso rendezvous. We were 20 minutes late for the start of the game.
What chance does a foreign money-laden tourist have?

FIRMS can splash out another #25 per head on Christmas parties for

The Inland Revenue yesterday said it had raised the tax-free limit
from #50 per head to #75, although the ceiling covers any other parties
thrown by companies throughout the year as well.
The tax-free limit on gifts from a business contact has also been
raised from #100 to #150 a year from each donor.

IN your report, Scottish MEPs split on notes (October 26), the
Nationalists accused Scottish Labour MEPs of voting against Scottish
banks being allowed to print their own notes within a single European
Currency.
The report by Mrs Randzio-Plath was on the Commission Green Paper on
the practical arrangements for the introduction of the single currency.
This was the European Parliament's view on the broad strategy to be
adopted for the various implementation stages of Economic and Monetary
Union. It was not a report on the minute detail of every nut and bolt
for EMU.
Therefore it was the wrong report in which to start insisting on who
or what should be printed on the backs of the various notes. This does
not rule out at a later date when Parliament gets round to discussing
the finer details of EMU that banks will not be allowed to print notes.
It is not surprising that the Nationalists once again confuse a
serious debate on implementation with nationalistic trivia in which they
only highlight their inadequacies on the greater European stage.

THE telecoms arm of ScottishPower is paying #10m for the right to
launch and install a branded radio-based domestic telephone service
across much of Scotland, in a drive to bypass and undercut British
Telecom's existing hard-wire alternative.
ScottishTelecom, launched last November, has signed a cooperation
agreement with Ionica, the Cambridge-based telecoms company, which is
pioneering fixed radio access as an alternative telecoms technology in
the UK.
While Ionica will continue to roll out the new service south of the
Border from next March, ScottishTelecom has taken over the licence north
of the Border. It will, within the next 15 months, launch a volume
service offering, according to its managing director Rod Matthews,
savings on BT bills of ''at least 15%''.
Subscribers will have to install a small hexagonal dish on their house
or business premises which provides the radio link into
ScottishTelecom's existing fibre optic cable network, in which it has so
far invested #40m. The system, which is digital, will be fully
integrated into other telephone networks worldwide.
ScottishTelecom also announced yesterday that it is moving into the
mobile phone business, by becoming a service provider to Vodaphone. It
will market that service from this New Year to larger corporates and,
through ScottishPower's retail outlets, to the general public. The
ScottishPower subsidiary will also become a strategic network supplier
to Vodaphone, currently BT's number one customer.
In a third strategic move, ScottishTelecom has signed a deal with COLT
Communications, to create a fibre optic link between Scotland and the
City of London. That service, claiming savings of 26% against comparable
BT rates, will be aimed primarily at the financial community.
Since ScottishTelecom's existing fibre network is primarily focused on
urban Scotland -- central Scotland with spurs through Dundee to Aberdeen
and south through both Ayrshire and the Borders -- the planned radio
telephone service will not be universally available.
Mr Matthews expects to be able to cover ''close to 50%'' of Scotland's
population at launch, rising to 75% ''in a small number of years''. But
more rural communities, including most of the Highlands and Islands, are
likely to be excluded, where topography and the sheer cost of extending
the fibre optic network render the investment uneconomic.
The maximum functional distance between house dishes and nodes on the
cable network is said to be around 18 kilometres. But that distance can
be shortened significantly in hilly terrain. But Mr Matthews did promise
further extension of the cable network, which he described as already
the most powerful anywhere in Europe.
The key for ScottishTelecom is the opportunity to provide a rival
domestic phone service which does not depend on the existing BT
connections to people's homes. That creates the opportunity to cut
tariffs significantly without compromising quality.
One outstanding issue is number portability outwith the BT system,
something Mr Matthews hopes can be resolved within the year. He added
that market research indicates a saving of 15% is the minimum needed to
persuade subscribers to change their number. ''We will certainly beat
that,'' he said.
Despite the Vodaphone deal, ScottishTelecom is continuing its minority
stake in Woodend Communications, an existing service provider aimed at
the small business market. Woodend was created by the team behind DX
Communications, the fast-growing service provider run by Richard
Emmanuel. ScottishTelecom has an option to acquire Woodend outright in
the future.
* TWO Scottish companies, one in Livingston, one in East Kilbride, are
collaborating to provide customers with a telecoms service which the
user can choose to access from personal computer or telephone.
Integrated Communications Scotland of Livingston and Locland Computer
of East Kilbride are pooling their expertise to provide a fully
integrated service.
They will use American software which will, if required, convert
text-based e-mail messages to speech. ICS officially opened a new
headquarters in Livingston yesterday.

Elizabeth Buie examines the vexed issue of Britain's position in the
World Prosperity League.
LABOUR launched its Budget offensive yesterday, taking out a full-page
advertisement in The Times proclaiming that Britain had slipped from
13th to 18th in the World Prosperity League in 16 years of Tory
government.
''If you'd slumped to 18th, wouldn't you get new management?'' was the
question posed by Labour.
The Tories responded with alacrity. Angela Knight, the Economic
Secretary to the Treasury, attacked Labour's figures, which were based
on GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per head at purchasing power parity,
provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
''Their selective use of figures hides the truth. The independent
OECD's recent report on the UK said: 'UK performance in 1994 was
impressive'. That is the truth. Gordon Brown (Labour Shadow Chancellor)
is playing with numbers again. In the real world, manufacturing
investment is up 11% on last year. Investment in plant and machinery is
up 14%,'' she said.
Then the Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine weighed in. He said
that Britain was at the top of the world prosperity league table at the
end of the 19th century but had been in persistent decline. Labour was
wrong to try to make party political points out of this trend, he said.
To compound the economic misery, both the European Commission and the
TUC published studies this week showing social security support for
British jobless as almost the worst in the European Union.
Only the Greeks and Irish apparently give less support to unemployed
people than the British, mainly because means testing, which is
particularly popular in Britain, is seen as a way of saving on the
social security budget.
But are we simply being manipulated by ''lies, damned lies and
statistics''? Does it really matter if Italy has supplanted Britain on
the prosperity league table, or if Singapore and Hong Kong have
leapfrogged us in recent years?
According to Dr Madsen Pirie, president of the Adam Smith Institute in
London, virtually all figures are used by one side or the other for
political propaganda.
What matters to people, he believes, is if they are doing better or
worse than before. If the Tiger or so-called New Tiger economies of
South-east Asia are growing quicker than ours, that is a sign that they
started lower than us and are simply closing the gap quicker.
''Actually there has been an unprecedented increase in living
standards compared to what they were before. People's own standards of
living are better and are getting better faster than they ever did
before. So what is the meaning in comparing that to Singapore or Hong
Kong?
''When you are considering how well a country is doing, you look at
several factors: GDP, income per head, and then small things like the
number of telephones, washing machines, video-recorders and central
heating,'' he said.
People had tried to maintain that Britain had plunged into poverty
because there was a bigger gap between rich and poor, said Dr Pirie.
Poverty was not defined in that way, he said, but according to people's
ability to get enough to eat, and decent accommodation.
Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics, Lord Desai
said that while actual income had gone up, there was no doubt that there
had been a growth in inequality affecting the lower quarter of the
income group. He added: ''Our average growth is not as good as other
countries, which is why we have fallen down the league table.''
Nevertheless, although the OECD table on prosperity does interpret
average incomes, it does not reflect the gap between the rich and the
poor. America, in second place, illustrated this, he said.
However, in Britain's case, according to Lord Desai, the Government
may not be right in claiming that different people have now dropped into
the poverty class.
''We know that it is the elderly and single mothers with children that
are the people who are poor, and they are stuck there. They are not
going to get out of there -- that is the central point,'' he said.
It is a point backed up by John Hills, one of the co-authors of a
report into income and wealth earlier this year by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation inquiry group.
Its key findings were that the gap between rich and poor has widened,
that this gap is damaging the social fabric, and that the problems are
becoming concentrated on particular groups and areas.
But he also warned that any snapshot of figures could be misleading,
for it may compare one country's slump and boom statistics with another
country's boom and slump figures. While one nation is emerging from
recession, another may still be floundering at the bottom.
The relevance of Britain's social security support performance
compared with its European partners lies in the long term -- the
creation of an unskilled, uneducated group, ''an economic drag anchor'',
which will inevitably mean a huge social and economic cost, said Mr
Hills.

Newcastle aim to rival England's top two.
GARY Armstrong and Doddie Weir, along with England's Tony Underwood,

Sir John Hall's ambitious Newcastle.
But while Underwood, the England World Cup and British Lions wing,

revealed that they had signed only Courage League registration forms.

''The Press reception we received has been amazing and has simply
bowled us both over. I haven't experienced anything like it before.
''Signing the registration forms, which we did last week, in itself
means nothing and I have previously signed forms for West Hartlepool but
didn't join the club.
''However, I must say that I have been very impressed by what I have
seen today. The facility at Kingston Park, Newcastle's ground, is
extremely good and Sir John Hall has plans to build a new 25,000-seater
stadium.
''But I have to stress that nothing is yet certain. Signing the form
has given us the option of playing here later in the season -- no more
and no less. Gary and I still have to sort out terms with Rob, and we
also have family and business commitments to sort out before I can think
of signing a contract for Newcastle.''
Armstrong, who at 29 is already one of Scottish rugby's all-time great
scrum halves and a British Lion, was equally cautious. ''While I signed
league registration forms for Newcastle, that is all at the moment, and
I have not made any formal commitment,'' he said.
Armstrong confirmed that if he did leave Jed-Forest he would continue
to live in Jedburgh and travel down -- Newcastle is only an hour away.
However, Weir, who lives in Edinburgh, where he works for brewers
Carlsberg Tetley, would probably have to move. ''My girl-friend
Katherine lives in Bellingham near Hexham, so I know the area well and
travel down on a regular basis,'' Weir said.
Andrew is in no doubt about the importance the two Scots have in his
plans, saying: ''I played with Gary in the 1989 British Lions tour to
Australia and he is quite simply a world-class scrum half, while Doddie
as a utility back-five forward is a huge signing for Newcastle.
''Both have a wealth of experience, having played for Scotland at
international level. When the Lions tour again in 1997, I fully expect
Gary and Doddie to be in the travelling party.''
If Armstrong and Weir do finally decide to join Newcastle, they will
team up with another Scottish cap, Peter Walton, the flanker who has
signed from Northampton and is expected to be back to full fitness by
Christmas following a successful knee operation.
Other new signings by Andrew in the past month include the Irish and
British Lions prop Nick Popplewell, former England No.8 Dean Ryan,
scrum-half Steve Bates, who will be joining the coaching staff and not
as a player, England A centre Graham Childs, and Richard Arnold, a
powerful Kiwi back-row forward who has recently gained an English
qualification.
But when asked whether he had also targeted Weir's Melrose clubmate
Graham Shiel, the Scottish international centre, Andrew would only say:
''We have been looking at players from all over, not just names but
players who can fit into this club.
''Once the players we have newly signed are eligible to play for
Newcastle alongside our present squad, we will be one of the three
strongest sides in England alongside Bath and Leicester.''
Underscoring Andrew's words, Sir John Hall said: ''Professional rugby
is here to stay and it is something the game has got to get used to at
the top level.''

STOCKBROKER Brewin Dolphin is planning to open a Glasgow office
shortly under the name of its Edinburgh offshoot, Bell Lawrie White.
A 10-strong institutional sales and corporate finance team is to join
the company from Greig Middleton in Glasgow and negotiations are
underway to recruit a private client team from another firm in the city.
Brewin Dolphin is seeking office premises and the new operation is
expected to open for business in a few weeks. Managing director John
Hall commented: ''We hope to build a reasonable presence within a
relatively short time.''
Bell Lawrie has some institutional business but is mainly a private
client firm, as is Brewin Dolphin as a whole.
Mr Hall explained that the Glasgow recruits will be the group's first
corporate finance team. The staff concerned joined Greig Middleton when
its parent company, King &amp; Shaxson, bought Allied Provincial in August
for #16m. Greig Middleton has more than 300 employees in Glasgow.
Brewin Dolphin is aiming to expand its network of branches, possibly
through acquisition.
Bell Lawrie was a strong performer for the group in the first half of
the year, being resistant to the downturn in business volumes which
affected other firms. However, Brewin's profits were still 21% lower at
#2m for the period.

WEIR Paper Products has set up a #10m paper recycling venture to
supply feedstock for its paper mill in Alloa, ending its dependence on
waste paper bought in at wildly fluctuating prices.
A new subsidiary called Weir Recycling will collect waste paper from
contracting companies and local authorities all over Scotland, sort it
and reprocess it at a special plant next to the Kilbagie Mills paper
factory.
Weir Recycling will create 70 new jobs by the time it is fully up and
running at the end of this year and will end Weir Paper's need to buy in
waste paper from other collectors at prices that range from #70 to #250
a tonne.
The company says it is offering factories, schools and offices an
environmentally friendly way of disposing of their waste paper, which in
most cases it collects free of charge, but does not pay for.
''We are not just trying to sell a service, we are trying to advise
people on how to deal with a problem in their own and the environment's
best interests,'' said general manager Fraser Mathers as Weir Recycling
was formally launched yesterday.
A fleet of half-a-dozen trucks will collect waste from contracting
suppliers such as Weir Pumps in Glasgow, the Wood Group in Aberdeen and
Edinburgh District Council and take it to a sorting station in
Grangemouth.
Once sorted, it will be taken to Weir Recycling's plant in Alloa which
can reprocess up to 45,000 tonnes a year.
This plant mixes waste paper with water to create a pulp which is
strained through filters before chemicals remove the ink. The resultant
clean pulp is then used as raw material in the adjacent paper factory.
Weir Paper Products is owned by Australian-based Pratt Industries.

EVIDENCE of fading price pressures in the manufacturing sector have
improved prospects of an interest rate cut after the Budget if economic
activity remains slow.
There was no sign of an immediate change in rates yesterday after the
regular monthly meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George. The next
meeting has been scheduled for December 13, two weeks after the Budget.
The latest purchasing managers' survey showed a sharp drop in the
prices index to its lowest level since November 1993. The index fell
from 57.5 in September to 52.5. This shows that input prices are still
rising but at a much slower pace than earlier in the year. The peak
reading of 78.2 was taken in April.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said the sharp fall
in the rate of increase in prices was caused by ''the continued
alleviation of supply constraints for many goods, such as paper,
plastics, and steel, while import prices have been steadied by the
stability of sterling''.
Growth in activity in the manufacturing sector remained lack-lustre.
The seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index registered 50.5,
compared with 50.4 in September. It was the 35th successive monthly
increase, but the index was well below its mid-1994 peak of 61.6. This
indicates only marginal growth in the manufacturing economy.
There was also evidence from the survey that delivery times were
improving for the first time in two years as manufacturing growth
slowed. The Suppliers' Delivery Times Index rose to 50.4 from 48.8 in
September. Generally weaker demand meant that, in most sectors, more
manufacturers' requirements were met more quickly.
On the downside the employment index registered the first drop in
manufacturing employment since September 1993. The index fell back from
50.8 in September to 49.8 as more firms released temporary labour or
announced redundancies on the back of a downturn in trade.
The institute's director-general, Peter Thomson, said: ''During
October industry saw significant alleviation of price and capacity
pressures.
''However, this has been due to a slowdown in activity rather than
increased capacity and better supply. This was reflected in the first
drop in employment levels for nearly two years.''
James Capel's Adam Cole made the point that the prices index was a
barometer of input rather than output prices. But he said: ''Taken
together with the CBI prices series (which measures output rather than
input prices) this is further evidence that a peak in factory gate price
inflation is close.
''On activity the survey showed little change from the sluggish
picture painted by the previous month's data.''
Mr Cole noted that the purchasing managers' survey was more
pessimistic than the CBI industrial trends, which enjoys a solid track
record.
In its report for the meeting between the Chancellor and the Governor
the Treasury stuck to its recent line that the monthly data were mixed,
but it pointed out that October's CBI industrial trends survey showed
output expectations for the next few months running ahead of recent
growth.
Third-quarter gross domestic product data confirmed ''continued growth
at a slower pace than last year.''
Meanwhile, September's credit figures, published by the Bank of
England yesterday, showed stronger than expected growth in personal
borrowing.
Net consumer credit rose from a revised #518m (#535m) in August to
#608m. The feature was a jump in credit card lending from #117m to
#192m, suggesting that consumers had taken on debt to finance higher
purchases of clothing and footwear, the feature of September's otherwise
drab retail sales figures.
But the credit data also provided further evidence that the housing
market was still in the doldrums. New mortgage commitments fell from
#4539m in August to #4337m. In the third quarter, mortgage commitments
were 5.5% lower than in the same period of last year.
The Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage provider,
reported that house prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% last month
after a revised increase of 0.4% (0.3%) in September. In the year to
October house prices fell by 1.8%.
The society repeated earlier calls for special measures to stimulate
the housing market in the Budget. It instanced the abolition of stamp
duty.
An earlier report from the Nationwide Building Society suggested
prices fell by 0.3% last month and were 3.9% lower than in October 1994.
* THE Bundesbank is not likely to cut official interest rates at
today's council meeting but analysts said yesterday that anticipation of
another eventual rate drop in the current business cycle was growing.
No rate action by the central bank will likely draw criticism from
German companies that have been calling for a reduction in rates in a
bid to weaken the strong mark and to boost German competitiveness.
The mark has soared against the currencies of key trading partners,
reducing expectations for 1995 economic growth because German products
have become more expensive against foreign competitors.

Washington
THE Bosnia peace conference opened today in an air base in Ohio, with
the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, laying down the four
objectives that must be attained.
Bosnia-Herzegovina must continue to exist as a sovereign state with
recognised and settled boundaries; the settlement must take into account
the special multi-ethnic status of Sarajevo; the human rights of
everyone in the region must be guaranteed, meaning that refugees must be
allowed to return home or receive compensation, and war criminals must
be brought to justice; and lastly, Eastern Slovenia must be returned
peacefully to Croatia.
These are all key issues, hotly contested by the parties, and will be
the subject of intense negotiations in the days to come. Just before the
conference opened, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the presidents of
Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Bosnia all issued statements that flatly
contradicted one another.
On the matter of war crimes, for instance, the Bosnian Government has
insisted that it will have nothing to do with the Bosnian Serb leaders
Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. Furthermore, they must be
brought to trial for ordering the massacres at Srebrenica and elsewhere.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia represents the Bosnian
Serbs but he can hardly expect Karadzic and Mladic to surrender to their
enemies and face probable execution.
The Bosnians are also demanding the return of Muslim towns that were
captured by the Serbs, and whose inhabitants were driven out.
As for the Serbs, they insist that Bosnian Serbs must have the right
to secede and join ''Greater Serbia''. They have conceded the principle
that their share of Bosnia should be no more than half, but disagree on
which half. They want some of the land they lost in fighting this summer
to be returned, and also demand that Gorazde be handed over to them and
that they obtain half of Sarajevo.
The Croatians are only marginally less dogmatic. They intend to
dominate the new Bosnian federation, and the strains between them and
the Muslims have been papered over, not resolved. Mr Christopher noted
their chief demand when he said that Eastern Slavonia should be returned
to them. This is the region, around Vukovar in eastern Croatia, that was
captured by the Serbs in vicious fighting in 1991.
Mr Christopher opened the conference, sitting with the three
presidents and the Russian and EU representatives. Other members of the
contact group, Britain, France, and Germany, are also taking part. Later
the chair was handed over to his deputy, Richard Holbrooke, who has led
American mediation efforts.
''We're embarking today on a process that may well be the last, best
chance for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' said Mr Christopher.
''I hope that some day Dayton, Ohio, will be remembered as the place
where the killing was finally brought to a halt.''
In his speech, the Secretary repeated that this was the last chance
for peace in Bosnia. ''We're here to prevent a wider war that would
undermine European security at a time when the whole continent should
finally be at peace,'' he said.
''The talks that begin here today are the best chance to achieve peace
since the war began. If we fail, the war will resume and future
generations will surely hold us accountable for the consequences that
would follow. The lights so recently lit in Sarajevo would once again be
extinguished.''
The Secretary also addressed the American people, who are deeply
sceptical of the president's intention to send American troops to police
the peace. He repeated that unless there is peace, there will be no
American involvement.
''If and when a formal agreement is reached,'' he said, ''but only
then, the United States and its partners, including Russia, will provide
military personnel to help implement the peace.''
The House of Representatives voted on Monday to deplore any American
involvement, demanding that the president obtain Congressional consent
before sending in American troops. The administration replied that the
resolution was unhelpful.
Mr Christopher said that there would be no American troop deployment
without peace, but that there would be no peace if Nato and the US were
not ready to police it. The Nato forces must also have ''a clear exit
strategy'' and there must be a plan for the economic recovery of Bosnia.
The three regional leaders, who arrived at the base last night,
offered some words of optimism.
''We cannot revive the dead. We cannot revive the 17,000 children dead
in Bosnia. But we can get justice here and that justice means a fully
functional Bosnian state, integrity, sovereignty, justice, and
democracy,'' said Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.

BRITAIN'S imports are rising at a slightly faster rate than her
exports, leading to a widening trend in the trade deficit according to
latest data from the Central Statistical Office.
Seasonally adjusted the deficit in August came to #1300m, against
#1100m in July and #900m in June. In the three months to August the
visible deficit came to #3300m, up from #2800m in the previous three
months.
Between the same periods, exports rose by 2.5%, compared with a 3.5%
increase in imports. The deficit with other European Union countries is
holding steady at about #300m a month but the deficit with other
countries widened to #1000m in August.
In particular the trade position with North America has worsened, with
exports dropping by 7% in the three months to August compared with the
previous three months while imports rose 10.5%. Economists hope that the
trend will be reversed as economic growth in the US picks up.
The 1% increase in total exports in August was entirely due to a 2%
rise in shipments to the European Union. The volume of imports and
exports, excluding erratic items like ships, aircraft, precious stones
and silver, edged up slightly to record levels in August.
Prices for both exports and imports both fell in the month, by 1.5%
for the former and 1% the latter. In the three months to August, export
prices rose 3% and import prices by 1%, leading to an improvement in the
terms of trade. Overall, Euopean Union prices rose much faster than
non-EU prices for both exports and imports.
Other figures released yesterday showed that foreign visitors to
Britain in August reached a record 2,870,000, an 11% increase on the
same month last year. But their spending was only a little higher at
#1465m and there was still a #575m deficit, with spending by UK visitors
abroad at #2040m showing a marginal fall on 1994.

ST Mirren footballer Barry Lavety was welcomed back to Love Street
yesterday but it was made plain to him that he might still face
disciplinary action as a result of taking drugs.
The player ended his six-week stay at the Castle Craig drug
rehabilitation centre on Tuesday.
However, his return to playing in the black and white jersey was
celebrated in style when he scored three goals against Hamilton on
Tuesday.
Later, the player read a short statement apologising for the affair
and thanked club, family, and friends for support and understanding,
after traces of the drug ecstasy were found in his sample during a
random drug test.
St Mirren chief executive Bob Earlie stressed the 21-year-old had not
been let off the hook. Instead, he will be monitored closely and random
drug tested, be sent back indefinitely to the drug clinic near Peebles
once a week for counselling, and have to report twice a day to the
Paisley ground for training and coaching duties.
Stressing that the club condemned Lavety's behaviour, Mr Earlie said:
''Barry has spent the past six weeks tracing the origins and
consequences of his actions. We are assured he has done so in an open
and honest manner.
''We are assured that he is wholeheartedly committed to change his
lifestyle and begin the task of rebuilding his football career.
''No-one is more aware of the difficulties that lie ahead than Barry,
and he is under no illusion that, if there is a repeat of this incident,
disciplinary action of the severest kind will be taken against him.''
The executive did not rule out the possibility that the player could
still face some form of disciplinary action.
He refused to comment on the extent of Lavety's drug taking and said
officials were still to receive a full report from specialists who had
been treating him.
The 29-strong squad of Love Street players have all been tested, every
one of Lavety's team mates showing a clean bill of health.
In the meantime, Lavety will have to assist community coach Tony
Fitzpatrick in sessions with young people at the ground's new fitness
centre.
It is expected he will make a statement later urging youngsters to say
no to drugs.
Tony Higgins, of the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association,
used the occasion to confirm that Scotland-wide random drugs testing of
footballers would be introduced soon.
He admitted there were concerns over drug use in the sport and that it
was recreational, not performance-enhancing substances which were
causing most alarm.
Police fear that drug barons could attempt to infiltrate sporting
circles and befriend individual stars to then use them as role models.

SPECIALIST support services group BET reported interim profits at the
top of City expectations, up 12% to #65m before tax.
Profits were boosted #5m by contributions from acquisitions which
helped margins to improve to 7.6% compared with 6.6% previously. There
is thought to be scope to further boost margins to around the 10% level
seen in the early 1990s.
The star performer in the group was the business services division
where operating profit rose 64% to #17m, helped by a #5m contribution
from two acquistions.
The distribution division was hit by destocking at US chemical
companies and profits dropped 24% to #12m despite a 7% rise in sales to
#199m. A better performance is expected next year following some
restructuring in the business.
BET said the group's focus would remain on tighter cost control and
marketing initiatives. As the group becomes more specialised it will
increasingly seek higher prices.
The company, headed by chief executive John Clark, remains on the
lookout for further acquisitions. BET is keen to upgrade its portfolio
of services and reduce the proportion of low growth businesses.
The active acquisition programme coupled with higher capital
expenditure pushed debt up to #114m at the end of September compared
with #17m a year ago. Gearing is currently 38% but the company would be
comfortable with a rise to 50%. There are no plans for a rights issue.
Following publication of the good results, BET shares were quoted at
129[1/2], up 3[1/2]p.
* ANDREW Cohen's Betterware doorstep catalogue group saw only a
marginal improvement in trading in the first 28 weeks with overall
turnover flat at #31.7m and pre-tax profits ahead by only 2.9% to
#4.08m.
Sales were down slightly in the UK although margins were helped by
last year's cost cutting. Trading in both France and Spain have shown
shown significant growth although Germany appears to have been difficult
with trading only at a modest level.
The company has been challenged on its trademark in some countries
although that will not affect the home delivery business in Britain.
The balance sheet remains strong with net cash of #8.1m following upon
the sale ofthe majority of the company's premises at Curdworth.
A maintained interim dividend of 0.85p will be paid on January 3.

Stewart Lamont argues that the Home Secretary had good reason to order
the exclusion of the Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon from
Britain, and many families may come to regret that the order has been
overturned.
THOSE of you who thought the Home Secretary had draconian powers to
exclude undesirables from visiting Britain must be somewhat puzzled
following the decision by Mr Justice Sedley to overturn Mr Howard's
exclusion order aginst the founder of the Unification Church, Sun Myung
Moon. I certainly find it puzzling.
If ever a man should be aware that he is not welcome it is the founder
of the Moonies. Since the inception of his cult in 1954 it has attracted
adverse publicity and criticism -- mostly from families who have been
detached from their loved ones once they have fallen under its spell. It
has never been out of the top 10 most hated groups identified by
anti-cult organisations.
Let us not be naive enough to think that the Moonies are blissfully
unaware of the criticisms against them, nor that Mr Moon, who has served
a prison term in America, would not know that his religion and its
methods are considered pernicious.
This country exercises legal control over sales practices which are
considered to be dishonest or shady. It would not be unreasonable if
someone known to be selling dubious timeshare property were denied entry
to Britain. Why then bother protecting someone who sells bogus
timeshares in eternity?
My objections to the Moonies have nothing to do with their doctrine.
They are entitled to believe the earth is flat or that Mr Moon is the
new messiah. In fact, they only believe the latter, and teach that God
is about to bring history to its culmination via a new trinity
consisting of Himself, the Lord of the Second Coming and his earthly
bride. This turns out to be Mr and Mrs Moon.
His followers are encouraged to assist in this process by filling the
world with ''holy children''. Hence the rush to hold weddings such as
the one three years ago at which Moon presided; 40,000 couples were wed
in Seoul, South Korea, and half as many again via satellite hook-ups
around three continents.
This would be no more obnoxious than the mass baptisms which take
place in the fast-growing Christian churches of Africa, were it not for
one thing -- these are arranged marriages. Most of the couples had not
met until a day or so before the weddings. For marriage to be taken
seriously in either a legal or religious sense it must surely be
something more than blind-man's buff played by thousands of people in a
football stadium at the behest of a convicted fraudster.
Let us also take up the ''charity'' work through which many of the
Moonie converts are recruited. It is done through MFTs, mobile
fundraising teams, who sell plants and trinkets. They tell people it is
for charity. It is actually for the Unification Church or -- more
sleekit -- for one of its various arms. This dishonesty would not be
acceptable for any proper charity; why should it be tolerated when
indulged in by a self-styled religious group? Furthermore, the
collectors are nothing better than slave labour. Such practices would be
regarded as pernicious if they were adopted by hamburger chains.
Let us look clearly at the exclusion of Mr Moon on non-religious
grounds. Let us assume that a convicted felon with links to right-wing
American groups of dubious worth wishes to come to Britain to promote
his organisation which raises funds by pretending it is a charity and
also arranges mass weddings between couples who have scarcely met. Would
we regard his exclusion by the Home Secretary as a denial of human
rights? I think not.
The problem of cults is not an easy one to deal with in a free
society. Drafting legislation which will define a cult is hard. Proving
that mind control has been exerted is equally difficult.
Even the family break-ups which are the stuff of cult activity are not
the kind of thing which can be outlawed. Rebellious teenagers join Hells
Angels? Is that not the kind of thing which would fall into anti-cult
legislation, and which most of us would think is better left outside the
law? However, there are two things which can be done.
The first is to resist any attempt to see the distinction between
cults and religions as purely semantic. Proper religions do not prevent
parents from seeing their children. They donate their charity to the
needy, regardless of whether they belong to the cult, and they allow
followers to leave without coercion and to criticise from within. Cults
do none of these things, and while they cannot be forced to do them,
they should at least be denied equality with proper religions under the
law.
The second thing is to act with whatever powers are available to curb
the activity of the cult or its leader. Michael Howard used his
political power on this occasion wisely. What a pity the Judge has made
Moon a martyr.

LLOYD'S of London last night announced an investigation into possible

It said the findings on Tuesday of the judge, Mr Justice Creswell, in
the case brought by almost 2000 so-called Names against a number of
professionals working in the market raised a ''prima facie'' case that
there may have been misconduct which could lead to disciplinary action
against a number of individuals.
''In view of the public interest in this matter, Lloyd's
investigations committee has decided that it is appropriate to announce
that the matters raised by Mr Justice Creswell's judgment are being
investigated,'' added Lloyd's in a statement.
''These investigations will follow Lloyd's established procedures and,
consistent with natural justice, no further announcement will be made
until the investigation has been completed.

Who should bear the cost of long-term care of the elderly? Jennifer
Cunningham examines a problem which grows more acute with the years.
ARADICAL market-forces solution to the pressing social and political
problem of how to pay for long-term care for the very elderly will be
proposed during a debate in Edinburgh tonight.
Eamonn Butler, director of the Adam Smith Institute, will suggest that
the division between health care and social care should be scrapped,
with individuals paying their own costs, supported by a safety net of
welfare provision.
The large numbers of elderly people anxious and angry at the prospect
of losing the house they have scrimped and saved to buy and leave to
their children in order to pay for nursing home care has prompted Age
Concern Scotland to hold a public debate on the subject. The charity's
director, Maureen O'Neill, said: ''It is time that these issues were
publicly debated, because as a country we have never voted on how or
whether long-term care should be funded. Decisions are now being made on
moving people from fully-funded NHS care into means-tested community
care without any discussion. Yet these people feel they have contributed
via National Insurance to publicly funded care in their old age.
Dr Butler believes that a system in which those who can afford it buy
social insurance provision would release public funds to provide more
generously for the most needy. ''The root of the immediate problem is
that the health care system is free under the NHS while the community
care system is not and the line between the two is distinctly fuzzy. The
solution is that both must be free or both must be paid for,'' he said.
He suggests an extension of the GP fund-holding system in which they
would control access to community care as well as medical care. ''We
would then have a multiplicity of providers, which would have the effect
of bidding up the quality and bidding down the cost of services,'' he
said.
To cool the political hot potato of ''people like my mum, who have
never had a credit card in their lives, been thrifty and bought their
council houses and now find that they are entitled to nothing, while
people who spent their money have their care paid by the state'', he
suggests allowing them to sell their homes, invest the capital and use
the interest to pay for care. It would have the benefit of leaving the
capital sum intact to pass on to offspring, while contributing to the
cost of care, which would be topped up when necessary by welfare
provision.
''The proposal that the capital exemption should be raised from #8000
to somewhere between #50,000 and #100,000 would cost billions. My own
view is that people should finance the cost of their own care. It is
quite outrageous that someone in a house worth #500,000 should get free
care if they transfer that asset to their successors. There are people
who have saved for a rainy day, but when that rainy day arrives, their
offspring decide they don't want to pay,'' he said.
In the long-term he would like to see a shift in pension rules to
allow the cost of care to be drawn as part of pension.
Private insurance schemes are largely unknown in the UK, because of
our system of National Insurance. ''The idea is gaining ground, but is
riddled with loopholes and barriers to receiving care,'' according to
Tessa Harding of the National Institute for Social Work. She will argue
that it is too expensive for most people, especially those who need it
most. They include the ill and disabled people, who are specifically
excluded. ''In the US, it doesn't work. It meets only 1% of the
long-term care costs,'' she said.
She will argue that using public sources to pay for long-term care
spreads the risk and provides greater security and that it could be done
either through the tax system or through a national social insurance
scheme with payments specifically for long-term care. ''We all pay
something, but not everything, and we all have the security of knowing
that support will be there when we need it,'' she said.
Eamonn Butler, however, predicts that in the long-term there will be
more insurance policies for care costs. ''They could have tax-free
premiums and the roll-up should also be tax-free. Although it is true
that some people would pay premiums from which they would not benefit,
but the orginal state pension was designed so that most people would be
dead before they could collect it. It was an insurance policy rather
than a savings policy.''
Tessa Harding warns: ''One in four of us will need some form of
long-term care during our lifetimes. Over a period of 20 or 30 years,
every family in the country is likely to experience the need. It is in
all or interests to sort out the fairest, most efficient, least wasteful
way of paying for it. Whatever we choose will reflect our values as a
society. The news that lack of a proper funding system has forced the
Church of Scotland to close four homes brings home just how little time
we have left.''
* The Great Debate takes place in New Parliament House, Regent Road,
Edinburgh from 5.30-8pm tonight.

JAPAN attempted to smash what it considers to be the misconception
that it is a closed economy in Glasgow yesterday.
The Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), which is financed by
the Japanese Government, was on a mission to educate Scottish businesses
about new export opportunities in the ''changing'' Far Eastern economy.
More than 20 delegates, most of them from Scottish manufacturing
companies, attended a seminar in the Grosvenor Hotel which was held in
conjunction with the Scottish Council Development and Industry (SCDI).
Another seminar is being staged at Stirling University today.
Jetro's visit is a precursor to an SCDI-led trade mission to Japan,
involving nearly 40 Scottish companies, later this month.
Hideo Kimura, professor of economics at Tokyo's Sophia University and
Jetro's guest speaker, said he would be telling Scottish companies that
''there happens to be a country called Japan with a wide open door''.
However, he added that Japan did not need to buy from Scottish
companies. It was up to them to adapt their products to meet the needs
of Japanese buyers.
Meanwhile, Robin Veitch, executive chairman of Cumbernauld-based
mackintosh manufacturer Traditional Weatherwear, talked about his
experience of the Japanese market at yesterday's seminar.
Explaining the reasons for Jetro's visit, director of public relations
Ken Katayama said: ''The role of Japan now in the world is to promote
mutual understanding and promoting free trade promotes mutual
understanding between countries.
''Japan has an image of being closed, which is completely untrue.''
According to Jetro, manufactured products account for the bulk of
Scottish exports to Japan, with the relative importance of traditional
exports like Scotch whisky diminishing.
Highlighting the fact that Japan's unemployment rate remained below 3%
and the efficiency of Japanese industry, Professor Kimura forecast that
his country's economy, in the doldrums at the moment, would return to
strength.

Damascus
MORE than 40,000 Palestinians shouting anti-Israeli slogans demanded
revenge at today's funeral of assassinated Islamic Jihad leader Fathi
Shqaqi.
Mourners at the martyrs' cemetery in a Palestinian refugee camp near
the Syrian capital Damascus blamed the Israeli secret service Mossad for
his death in Malta last week.
Israel has welcomed the assassination but has not confirmed or denied
any part in it.
New Jihad leader Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, speaking for the first time
since his appointment, vowed to continue Shqaqi's hardline policies in
the fight against Israel and its peace deal with the PLO.
Shqaqi was gunned down by unidentified men in Malta last Thursday
while he was on his way to Syria from Libya, where he had talks with
Colonel Gaddafi.
His body was flown to Damascus yesterday aboard a chartered Tunisian
plane.
In the Iranian capital Iran, thousands of Iranians shouting ''revenge,
revenge'' held an anti-Israeli rally to mark the death of Shqaqi.
It was art of a national day of mourning to coincide with Shqaqi's
funeral.
Speakers at the rally said his murder would draw more Palestinians to
the fight against Israel and against its peace process with the PLO, and
this would be the best revenge for his death.
However Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a leader of the largely sidelined
radicals, said Muslims should take revenge by killing US and Israeli
leaders.
''Leading figures of the White House, international Zionism, and
leaders of the Zionist state (Israel) and especially (Prime Minister)
Yitzhak Rabin and heads of Mossad are all mohareb -- those who wage war
on God -- and it is up to Muslims, inside and outside of Palestine, to
destroy them,'' said Mohtashemi.
Speakers were interrupted by chants of ''Death to Israel and America''
and the demonstrators cheered as an Israeli flag was set on fire.
Meanwhile, Muslim Hizbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon today killed
two Israeli-backed militiamen and wounded five Israeli soldiers in
machine gun and rocket attacks which they said were to avenge Shqaqi's
murder.
Lebanese security sources said Hizbollah suffered one dead and three
wounded in clashes which erupted with the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army on the last active Arab-Israeli frontline.
Israeli security sources said four Israeli soldiers were wounded when
guerrillas fired at their post and a bomb exploded near a patrol at
Braachit on the edge of Israels security zone in the south of Lebanon.
A fifth soldier was hurt in another incident, they said.
Israeli and SLA forces retaliated with heavy artillery fire on several
Hizbollah-held villages and areas north of the buffer strip. There was
no immediate word on casualties.--Reuter.

Colombo
SRI LANKA'S army has pushed to the gates of the northern Tamil
stronghold of Jaffna, but fears rebel ambushes and chemical weapon
attacks if it pounces on the city.
As the country waited for the army to make its move, state television
announced today that schools across the country were to close for up to
a month for fear of reprisal attacks.
Schools in Colombo were placed under guard last week after rumours of
possible attacks on them by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE),
who are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in majority
Sinhalese Sri Lanka.
Aid workers say the army could move into Jaffna city within hours if
it wanted to after a mass exodus of more than 100,000 rebels and
civilians left it a virtual ghost town.
''They may have tried to depopulate Jaffna so that they can use
chemical weapons when our troops move in,'' said a senior military
officer.
The rebels used chlorine gas to attack troops in 1990 during a failed
attempt to overrun an army camp, but caused no harm. The officer said
the army was taking the chemical weapon threat seriously and had
distributed gas masks to some of the troops.
Although soldiers were close to the outskirts of the battered city,
their advance would be slowed by minefields, booby-traps, and ambushes
laid by the LTTE, he said.
A senior Western relief worker in touch with colleagues in Jaffna said
the city looked almost empty with the army just to the north.
''It could be in Jaffna city within hours today,'' he said. ''The LTTE
has left Jaffna city. Apparently they're not ready to fight in Jaffna.
This is good for the people, but it has triggered an exodus of civilians
and we're trying to ensure their safety.''
Three army divisions of more than 21,000 men backed by tanks,
artillery, and aircraft have pushed south from their Palaly airbase and
now stand less than 3[1/2] miles of the city centre.
The offensive launched on October 17 is the army's biggest against the
Tigers, fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the
north-east of the island nation. More than 50,000 people have died in
the 12-year war.--Reuter.

ACTION, not words, aimed at bringing Nigeria back to democratic rule
by the Commonwealth heads of government when they meet next week in
Auckland was called for yesterday in London by the Commonwealth
Secretary General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku.
Presenting his annual report, he refused to specify what kind of
action but clearly it could involve at the very least, some kind of
sanctions, and at the worst, expulsion from the Commonwealth.
It will be the first time the heads of government have discussed the
crisis in Nigeria and they are likely to set out a timetable for the
regime in Nigeria to observe. The military dictatorship has promised
elections in three years' time but that is considered far too slow.
The crisis has worsened this week by the death sentence passed on
Tuesday upon leading Nigerian author Ken Saro-Wiwa and three other
activists of his movement for Ogoni people's rights. Chief Anyaoku, a
former Nigerian Foreign Minister, said there was ample legal room to
overturn the sentence. If not, Nigeria should brace itself for possible
Commonwealth retaliation.
At the 1991 Heads of Government Meeting in Harare, a declaration was
passed setting out the principles Commonwealth member states are
expected to adhere to. Nigeria is not alone in flouting them, but it is
the worst case. Chief Anyaoku said what was required was credible action
which went well beyond rhetoric.
Three Commonwealth countries -- the others are Sierra Leone and Gambia
-- were under military regimes which showed every sign of internal
tension and serious cases of the denial of human rights, he said.
All three faced worsening social and economic conditions as well as
the prospect of real internal conflict unless their people were speedily
given democratically elected government. The Commonwealth had to face up
to the question of what it could do to promote greater adherence by
member states to the commonly avowed fundamental values set out in the
Harare declaration.
Nigeria is not the only issue which the heads of government will be
discussing next week. The French nuclear testing in the Pacific will
feature on the agenda, as will the situation in Cyprus and Sri Lanka.
Unusually, the Foreign Secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, will not be
attending the Auckland meeting. He is going on a tour of the Middle East
on Sunday and his place will be taken by the Overseas Development
Minister Baroness Chalker.
The meeting opens tomorrow in Auckland and the heads of government
spend Saturday and Sunday in retreat at Queenstown on the South Island
before returning for the final session on Monday.

Washington
PRESIDENT Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress spent two hours
today arguing over the budget and the national debt, and neither side
gave ground. This brings the danger of the United States defaulting on
its obligations one step nearer.
Under current law, the ceiling on the national debt is $4900bn. That
limit will be reached in a few days, and unless Congress agrees the
Treasury will then be unable to pay the money it owes on its existing
debts or to finance the continuing operations of the government.
It is not clear just when the Treasury will default. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said recently that the last date was November 7,
but he may have a few days' leeway. He has to find a $25bn payment on
November 15, and another huge payment on December 1.
Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, said before the meeting with the
president that he would not accept any increase in the debt ceiling
until the president signed the budget. The president's spokesman said
this morning that Mr Clinton would prefer the country to default to
accepting the huge cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and other programmes that
the Republicans in Congress have approved.
The budget has passed both houses, in rather different versions. The
two have to be reconciled, and the final version will then be sent to
the president, who has promised to veto it.
Hard-liners among the Republicans say they will not agree to raise the
debt until Mr Clinton has accepted their terms. Mr Clinton insists that
there can be no linkage between the two issues.
In a few days the Treasury is going to run out of money. The United
States has never defaulted on its debts before, and some Wall Street and
other experts insist that to do so would be catastrophic and might cause
immense disruption in world markets, and might even lead to a
replacement of the dollar by the yen or the mark as the main currency of
international exchange.
Others are less apocalyptic, noting that these conflicts over the debt
ceiling are a regular feature of politics in Washington.

BOWLING
KENNY Logan and Alex Marshall had mix fortunes in Hong Kong yesterday,
scoring a win and a defeat in the classic pairs.
The Scots played well in their sixth-round match against Hong Kong
international pair, Bill McMahon and David Tso, winning 19-14, but they
then found the unbeaten South Africans Donny Piketh and Neil Burkett too
strong, the Africans winning 17-12.
However, the Scots are in fourth place in the 12-country table and on
course for a place in Saturday's knock-out quarter-finals.
With Logan in better form than of late, the Scots were always in
command against McMahon and Tso after having moved 3-1 ahead on the
second end. They moved to 19-8 after 18 ends and conceded six shots over
the last three ends but still finish 19-13 winners.
In their afternoon clash with the South Africans, the Scots just lost
out after a great tussle. The opening 14 ends were confined to singles.
At that point the South Africans led 8-6 and on the next two ends they
struck a decisive blow, with counts of 4 and 2 pushing them 14-6 ahead
and they went on to win 17-12.
Scotland, who had started the day in third place, dropped to fourth
after Wales notched up two wins over local sides.
South Africa look certain of a place in the knockout stages as they
hold a four-point lead over New Zealand and Wales, with the Scots a
point further back.
In the other section, Channel Islands duo Adrian Welch and David Le
Marquand also are unbeaten and they hold a four-point advantage over
Zimbabwe and hosts Kowloon Bowls Club, with England's John Ottaway and
David Ward moving into fourth place.

AN 18-year-old girl was murdered in 1975 when carrying Fred West's
baby because she was pushing into family life at 25 Cromwell Street, it
was alleged yesterday.
At the time, Mrs Rosemary West was being taunted by her husband over
Miss Shirley Ann Robinson's pregnancy, Mr Brian Leveson, QC,
prosecuting, declared at Winchester Crown Court.
''It was extremely humiliating and you would remember it from that day
onwards,'' Mr Leveson told Mrs West, 41.
Howver, she insisted it had not happened like that.
''She was pushing in on your family life?'' he persisted.
''No, sir, I would have asked her to leave.''
''Your life would have come tumbling down if Fred West had gone off
with Shirley,'' counsel continued.
''No, sir,'' said Mrs West.
She denied that Miss Robinson was in exactly the same position Mrs
West was in when she first met Fred West and he was married to his first
wife, Rena.
''The girl was pregnant, sir. I would not kill a baby. I would not
kill anyone. It took a really sick mind to do that,'' said Mrs West.
''By this time your were perfectly used to it,'' Mr Leveson insisted.
''To what, sir?''
''Killing people.''
The remains of Rena West and her Scots-born babysitter Ann McFall were
recovered from separate fields some distance from Gloucester. Mrs West
is not blamed for these killings.
She is accused of murdering 10 girls and young women, including Miss
Shirley Ann Robinson.
Mrs West was in the witness box for the third day yesterday. She was
asked about the joint sex attack on 15-year-old Caroline Owens in 1972.
''It is the one mistake I made in my life,'' said Mrs West. ''One I am
certainly regretting now.''
She added: ''I am going to pay dearly for the one mistake in my
life.''
Mr Leveson said he was not talking about a mistake. He was talking
about a whole course of conduct.
Mrs West said that indecent assault was not attempted murder. In the
current trial, she was not accused of assault but murder.
Mr Leveson insisted the accused was not going to pay for one mistake.
He pointed out that, like many of the victims, Caroline Owens's face had
been taped during the assault.
Mr and Mrs West were each fined #50 in 1973 for that attack.
Prosecuting counsel demanded: ''Caroline Owens was the start of your
career of sexually abusing girls.''
''No sir,'' Mrs West responded.
Asked about another victim, Linda Gough, Mr Leveson pointed out that
just as was the case with Miss Owens, she had been taped. He asked the
accused if she had seen the photographs.
''Unfortunately, sir,'' she replied. It was, however, nothing to do
with her. It had been Fred who was responsible. ''I was never involved
in killing her,'' she said.
Asking about Carol Cooper, another victim, Mr Leveson wondered if that
had been another mistake. ''It was Fred, not me,'' said Mrs West.
She insisted that she had never seen Lucy Partington, another victim
who was gagged. Asked if she wanted to see these photographs, Mrs West
replied: ''No, I have seen enough of that horror, thank you.''
Four months later in 1974, Therese Siegenthaler went missing. She had
also been bound and gagged, Mr Leveson said. This was to keep these
girls quiet. ''Not just for a few minutes, but for lengthy and prolonged
abuse,'' Mr Leveson added.
Mrs West insisted that she was not involved in the killings of Shirley
Hubbard, Juanita Mott, and Alison Chambers.
The Crown counsel turned to the evidence of her stepdaughter, Anne
Marie Davis, who had told the court she was sexually abused by both her
father and stepmother when she was eight. It was abuse that was to
continue for years, she told the court.
Mrs West denied emphatically that she had sexually assaulted her
stepdaughter.
She did, however, admit taking her to public houses when she was 12 or
13. She explained that Anne Marie was drinking anyway -- ''she was a
good drinker'' -- and she was taking an interest in her.
''I thought she would be safe with me,'' Mrs West said.
She denied she had laughed when Fred West raped Anne Marie in the back
of his van after one visit to a pub. She did, however, admit that she
went out with Anne Marie and found ''a fellow'' for her on one occasion.
At that time she was 12.
''She was grown up for her age,'' said Mrs West.
''After what you have done to her, that is not surprising,'' counsel
added.
Mr Leveson described how young girls, lost souls in care, would flock
to 25 Cromwell Street looking for a shoulder to cry on.
Mrs West agreed that the house was full of people like that at one
time.
Asked why she had given different accounts to various people over the
disappearance of her own daughter, Heather, in June 1987, when aged 16,
Mrs West said that a lot of what was said had been gossip and rumour.
''It's been done a lot in this case,'' she added.
Mrs West said that she was the one in the spotlight. ''Fred West is
dead and I have got to take responsibility for what he done.''
Mr Leveson said that it was not a case of everyone dumping blame on
her. It was a case of her dumping everything on Fred West.
''I did not get mixed up in murder, especially my own daughter,'' she
added. She admitted she had not gone to the police, Salvation Army, or
any other organisation in an attempt to trace Heather.
Mrs West said that she heard from Fred that Heather had been seen
locally and she often went out with her children hoping to come across
her in the streets of Gloucester.
''Were you hoping secretly that it would all have been a bad dream and
that you had not been involved in killing her and she would walk round
the corner?'' Mr Leveson asked.
''Is that the lie you have been living?''
''No, sir,'' the accused replied.
Mr Leveson asked if Heather had died because, ''she was going to blow
the whistle''?
Mrs West replied: ''I don't know. Fred killed her, sir.''
A witness, described as Mrs B, told how in 1960, when she was 15, she
had been raped on two separate occasions by Fred West. The first was
when he had given her a lift and took place near the gate to a field.
He was alone during both attacks.
Under cross-examination, Mrs B agreed with Mr Leveson that at the time
Fred West had wanted to marry her and had tried to give her a ring with
stones in it. No violence and no threats were involved in either attack.
The trial continues.

TENNIS
JO DURIE ended Scottish interest in the singles at the national
championships at Telford yesterday when she defeated Michele Mair in the
second round of the women's event.
Earlier, the 24-year-old from Edinburgh had struggled past qualifer
Louise Latimer 4-6, 7-6, 6-3, and recovered from a 3-1 deficit in the
first set to level at 3-3, but Durie, a winner of the title seven times,
confirmed her class when she won eight of the next nine games to
complete a 6-3, 6-1 success.
America-based Scot Philippa Palmer and qualifier Jennifer Duncan fell
at the first hurdle but produced creditable performances against tough
opponents.
Palmer, 28, led 5-2 in the second before going down 6-3, 7-5 against
big-serving Amanda Janes, 17-year-old daughter of former Wimbledon
finalist Christine Truman, while 19-year-old Duncan kept No.7 seed Lucie
Ahl on court for more than two hours before bowing out 7-6, 6-4.
Miles MacLagan, beaten by Jeremy Bates in last year's final, joined
Ross Matheson on the first-round casualty list when he lost his opening
match to teenage prospect Jamie Delgado.
The 21-year-old Scot, winner of last week's British Tour event at
Taunton, dropped his serve in the fourth game and trailed 5-2 in the
first set before reeling off the next three games for the loss of just
four points. The Berkshire teenager then held serve to lead 6-5, and
broke MacLagan in the twelfth to pocket the set in 47 minutes.
The fifth-seeded Scot took an early break in the second set and went
on to establish a 5-3 lead, but he failed to convert a set point on his
own serve at 5-4, and Delgado broke back in the tenth game and again in
the twelfth, clinching his 7-5, 7-5 victory on his fifth match point.

JOCKEY Frankie Dettori, who will be in Australia next week for the
Melbourne Cup, has five mounts at Edinburgh today.
His presence at the Musselburgh track for the final Scottish Flat
meeting of 1995 will ensure a big crowd.
Dettori partners Sheikh Mohammed's Santillana in the maiden race, and
the two-year-old should improve on his last performance when third at
Newmarket in September.
Julie Cecil has Flying Fishing, partnered by Ray Cochrane, and the
race could develop into a tussle between those two.
Frontiersman, who runs in the Ladbroke On-Course Handicap, also is
ridden by Dettori. Trained by Bill Watts the three-year-old has not
raced since mid-July when third to Imperial Bid at Newcastle.
Linda Perratt's Northern Spark, 12-1 winner for the Cree Lodge yard at
Newcastle on Monday, turns out again tackling slightly longer distance
than last time, but carrying seven pounds less.
Northern Spark cost just 2000 guineas at Doncaster in September was
the first leg of a 168-1 double for Perratt who is convalescing after an
operation to have two discs removed from her spine.
She runs Diet in this handicap over an extended mile, and that can
only be to give the nine-year-old one more race before the curtain falls
on this season.
The feature race is the November Handicap over one mile seven
furlongs, in which Richard Quinn rides Merit for Paul Cole. On the all
weather at Lingfield last month it beat Loki, the 9-2 favourite in the
Elm Handicap.
The three-year-old, owned by Prince Fahd Salman, is almost certain to
start favourite in this company.
Gay Kelleway has a good strike record at Musselburgh and her
four-year-old, Opera Buff, winner of a maiden at Nottingham, is not
without a chance.

ATHLETICS:
LAST week, Diane Modahl opened the back gate of her home in suburban
Manchester, and set off into the adjacent park for a gentle 20-minute
jog. It was just two weeks since the birth of her first child, and these
were the first tentative steps on a road which she hopes will go some
way to restoring normality to her life and set her on the road to the
Atlanta Olympics.
Though cleared in a British court of misconduct, that hope may be
premature. So, also, may be the jubilation climaxed by today's
publication of a book*, outlining the former Commonwealth 800 metres
champion's role at the centre of the biggest doping controversy to hit
British athletics.
Branded a drug-taking cheat, and a liar for having the temerity to
challenge the guilty verdict, she turned down #250,000 from the tabloid
media and fought to clear her name. She believes she has done so, but
the world body refuses to reinstate her.
Serialisation rights, and the sale of exclusive pictures with her
daughter Imani -- the Swahili word for hope -- mean she and her husband,
Vicente, will probably not have to sell their home. But it has been a
close call, for legal costs are estimated at #250,000.
''We stood to lose our savings, our house, everything we owned,
including what was most precious of all: our reputations,'' says Diane.
But one athlete who remained loyal, British 400m champion David
Grindlay, offered to buy a terraced home for them if they were forced to
sell their renovated two-storey home.
Yet given the weight of evidence which she outlines, it seems
astounding the case ever got as far as it did.
Of its nature, her view is one-sided, but it spells out how the
International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory in Lisbon, which
conducted the tests on which she was condemned, breached Olympic
guidelines.
Urine samples are not supposed to be tested if they exceed an acidity
reading of 7.5. Modahl's sample had degraded so much that the acidity
had increased from five to nine by the time it was tested. This equates
to a ten thousandfold increase in bacterial contamination.
No sample should be analysed without evidence of a contemporaneous
chain of custody. Every handler of the sample, from the original testing
officer, and including couriers and receptionists handing it on, to the
scientist analysing it in the lab, is supposed to sign, and time and
date an accompanying document. Otherwise there is no proof that the
sample analysed is that of the donor. This custody sheet was never
produced in Modahl's case (a retrospective summary was offered),
representing a second definitive reason why the test should have been
abandoned.
Modahl tells how her imminent scientific team conducted original
research which showed that unrefrigerated samples -- as hers was stored
-- could, in defiance of accepted theory, increase hormone levels.
These revelations not only helped win her case in the UK courts, but,
now detailed publicly, blow a potentially lethal hole in world dope
testing proceedures.
Modahl traumatically tells of the ''frightening and humiliating''
experience of her body being invaded by strangers, as they checked for
cancer. Instead they found polycistitis, which can produce inflated male
hormone readings. But research into the condition was inadequate for it
to be deemed conclusive proof of innocence.
Since the book was printed, the IAAF have confirmed they are to take
her case to arbitration. Though the decision was taken three months ago,
it was last Thursday before the IAAF communicated that decision
officially to the Modahls.
Inevitably, costs will escalate again. As Modahl chillingly concludes:
''To all my fellow athletes, I wish you luck when you give your next
urine sample . . .''

HUNDREDS of Scots suffering from the side-effects of steroids have
claimed they were never warned by their GPs about the drug's dangers.
They claim steroids have caused them to endure crippling illnesses
like the bone-crumbling disease osteoporosis, as well as angina,
diabetes, cataracts, weight gains, and skin disorders.
Now they are joining an estimated 2000 other victims in Britain who
are taking legal action against the medical profession, claiming they
were not informed of the side-effects.
Several of the Scottish cases are highlighted on the BBC's Frontline
Scotland programme being shown tonight.
One of those is Mr Bill Coutts, a former PT instructor from
Livingston, West Lothian, who is so crippled by osteoporosis that he is
forced to use a wheelchair.
The once fit 55-year-old claimed he had never been warned of the
potential effects of a steroid when it was prescribed in 1981 for his
asthma.
Mr Coutts said yesterday: ''I only found out by accident what they
were when I had to inject the drug myself on holiday. In the packet
there was a list with all the side-effects, none of which had ever been
mentioned to me.''
Another case highlighted in the programme was Mr Jim Hart, who died in
June after steroids irreparably damaged his immune system.
The family of the 67-year-old from Tranent, East Lothian, noticed the
changes in Mr Hart only weeks after he started taking the drug. A year
later he was dead.
After receiving hundreds of letters telling similar stories, Mr Hart's
daughter, Yvonne, is starting a campaign to make people aware of the
dangers of steroids.
Miss Tina Manuel, a solicitor with Glasgow firm L and L Lawrence who
are dealing with over 60 steroid cases, said new clients were coming in
constantly.

Johannesburg
SOUTH Africans today voted in their first all-race local government
elections, completing the destruction of an apartheid system that had
turned the country into an international pariah.
''Last vote to freedom,'' the Johannesburg Star newspaper said in a
banner headline.
Election officials reported little trouble around the country where
some 13 million people were registered to vote for nearly 700 councils.
Final results are expected by Friday.
President Nelson Mandela did not vote today. Local elections in Cape
Town, where he is registered, in KwaZulu-Natal province, and in a number
of rural areas were postponed over demarcation disputes.
Blacks in poor, violent townships around Johannesburg expect quick
action by their new councillors in providing basic amenities such as
sewage disposal, clean water, and a decent environment.--Reuter.

Moscow
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin does not look well, his top aide
admitted today after visiting his boss in hospital for the first time
since his heart attack last Thursday.
His comments took the edge off official comments suggesting that the
64-year-old Kremlin leader was set to resume running Russia from his
hospital bed.
Yeltsin's wife Naina and other Kremlin officials had said on Tuesday
that he was improving.
Today, however, senior aide Viktor Ilyushin said: ''Unfortunately the
hospital atmosphere has left its impression on the external face of the
Russian President and I cannot say that he looks well.''
He added that Yeltsin himself was aware his latest heart attack was
''not a joking matter''.
On doctors' orders, the meeting in Moscow's Central Clinic Hospital
lasted only 10 minutes.
It represented Yeltsin's first talks with any of his Kremlin staff
since the heart attack, the second in less than four months.
Until today doctors had barred any access to Yeltsin except for family
and security guards in a move which contributed to speculation that his
condition may be more serious than Kremlin officials have been
suggesting.
No pictures or television footage of Yeltsin have been released since
he was rushed into hospital.
Doctors say he will be under close medical supervision until the end
of this month and will be confined to bed until the end of this week.
Ilyushin said the Kremlin leader had discussed with him financial and
international issues and initiated legislative action on Russia's
proposed civic code.
The brief bedside summit came as preparations for next month's
parliamentary election were thrown into chaos with claims of foul play
by the Central Electoral Commission.
The crisis provoked Yeltsin to issue his first order on Tuesday since
falling ill. He demanded that Central Electoral Commission chairman
Nikolai Ryabov explain its ban on several parties from taking part in
the election to the State Duma.
Today Yeltsin's press service said the Commission had complied and
supplied him with the necessary documents.
It quoted Yeltsin as saying he was confident that the Supreme Court
would deliver judgments ''in full accordance with the law''.
Russia's leading liberal bloc, Yabloko, today appealed to the court to
overrule the decision barring it from the vote.
The judges have three days to rule on the issue, which has stirred a
political storm in Moscow and cast doubt on whether the election will be
democratic or even take place.
The Central Electoral Commission said at the weekend that Yabloko, led
by Grigory Yavlinsky and one of the strongest contenders in the poll,
had broken election rules by dropping six candidates against their
wishes.
Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Medvedev said the president was
anxious to ensure that all groups were being treated equally according
to the law.
The Derzhava Party of Yeltsin's arch foe Alexander Rutskoi is among
five groups so far barred from taking part in the election.--Reuter.

SEX, seduction, emotional manipulation -- and more sex. It's amusing
how Christopher Hampton's treatment of Les Liaisons Dangereuses gets
away with so much hanky-panky. Throw on a few elaborate period costumes
(and throw them all off again later), set it among the aristocracy of
far-off pre-Revolutionary France, and watch an otherwise prudish British
public lap it up.
If they're not doing it, they're talking about it; if it's not the
real thing, it's innuendo. But the appeal of the play goes a lot deeper
than titillation. It's a rattling good yarn, like an intellectual game
of chess, with virgin pawns being sacrificed by dissolute kings and
queens in the hope of seducing noble knights.
Sweeping across the play is the regal relationship between the
Marquise de Merteuil (a feline Briony McRoberts) and the Vicomte de
Valmont (a smooth-talking Graham McTavish) whose extended courting
ritual provides the structure from which to hang any number of minor
intrigues and corruptions. It's as fascinating as gossip.
And the play is compelling because it's about the way we deceive each
other -- if not to such a hedonistic extent -- in order to get our own
way. Valmont turns this into an art, but it only takes one seduction for
the convent girl Cecile (Gail Watson) to begin lying to mother and lover
alike.
I'd have liked to see more sexual chemistry in Richard Baron's
production, which isn't afraid to be sexually explicit but could pay
more attention to the animal magnetism that bubbles under the fine
clothes and genteel speeches. But the show sails by with clarity, humour
and, after a delicate, vulnerable performance by Hilary Maclean
(Tourvel), more than a little poignancy.

FOR workaday Scottish daftness, the Aberdonian trio of Buff Hardie,
Steve Robertson, and George Donald have been the boys for almost 40
years. And despite their imminent retirement, the threesome commendably
retain the innocent optimism of old-time undergraduate revue-members.
Their gleeful enthusiasm breathes new life into venerable gags --
imagine yon lucky nightwatchman warming his hands on a brassiere instead
of a brazier! Their witty wordiness extends beyond the employment of
ripe, criminally under-used Doric terms, too. On the downside, however,
there's a student smugness to some of George Donald's songs.
Similarly, there's irritation in Scotland The What's repeated
parodying of TV shows. In failing to exploit the theatrical potential of
the very stage upon which they stand, the trio saddle their show with a
static look and a second-hand air.
Tuesday's audience were there to enjoy Scotland The What's comedy, not
to analyse it, though. They laughed a lot. Laughter-of-recognition?
Principally at recognising local place-names, but also at being
presented with a universal truth, too: the human race is essentially an
idiotic three-legged one with a tendency to run round in circles.
Steve Robertson transmits this message with mischievous likeability,
whether he's being the regimental parrot of the Gordon Highlanders or a
querulous granddad. He's also a better Andy Stewart than Andy Stewart
frequently was.
Gentle satire is Scotland The What's forte, but there was a sombre and
affecting note in their depiction of the real deprivation which is
currently blighting the rural Aberdeenshire which their comedy has long
mythologised. Their farewell show runs until November 25. Haste ye back,
Scotland the Wha-ha-ha-ha-ho-ho-hee-hee . . .

Moscow
THE next Russian Parliament could be a den of thieves if nothing is
done to stop criminals using elected office to protect themselves from
prosecution, a top businessman claimed today.
''Together we can stop the criminals from prising their way into
Parliament,'' Vladimir Shcherbakov said in an appeal to political groups
to follow his Labour Union bloc in giving up their right to immunity if
they are elected.
Shcherbakov, a former Soviet Labour Minister turned rich businessman,
told a news conference that dozens of potential MPs were accused of
crimes ranging from tax evasion to corruption.
He quoted the Central Electoral Commission as saying more than 80
people with a criminal record had applied to stand in polls to the State
Duma lower house scheduled for December 17.
''There can be no doubt that the real situation is 10 times more
serious than the commission's official statistics describe,'' he said.
Shcherbakov, 46, whose party links unionists with industry leaders,
said the bloc had voluntarily relinquished its members' immunity to
prosecution and was urging others to do the same.
Russian law protects deputies and people running for election from
prosecution unless the Duma votes otherwise.
Shcherbakov told how police in St Petersburg had arrested a man for a
traffic offence, but apologised when they discovered he was an MP.
''It is not just a disgrace, it is a shameful issue for Russia. How
can anyone believe in the intellect of MPs and in their honesty?'' he
said.
Shcherbakov also cited the case of Sergei Mavrodi who was kicked out
of Parliament last month, paving the way for his prosecution as the head
of the MMM pyramid fund accused of swallowing up thousands of
shareholders' savings.
Asked if he feared people might take advantage of any decision to lift
MPs immunity, Shcherbakov said: ''This may be dangerous for single MPs,
but it is much less dangerous for Russia than turning parliament into a
den of thieves.''
In 1993 Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Russia had become a world
''Mafia power''. He declared an all-out war on crime and corruption,
saying crime had reached such a scale that it could pose a bigger threat
to stability than political conflict.
However campaigns have failed to halt a rise in gang murders,
protection rackets, corruption, and business chicanery, which have
flourished since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990.
Last month Yeltsin said that there had been a ''marked
intensification'' of efforts by criminals to shield their activities
behind parliamentary immunity.--Reuter.

BURUNDI'S government accused its own army today of massacring 253 Hutu
villagers in a raid on a remote northern province.
A statement from the president's office faxed to Kigali in Rwanda said
the villagers were killed last Friday by Tutsi soldiers chasing Hutu
rebels.
It said soldiers had acted without the knowledge of Burundi's military
authorities after a rebel attack.
The troops also set houses ablaze and burnt down a commercial centre,
the statement said.
Presidential cabinet chief Mames Bansubiyeko also put the blame on the
military.
There is an uneasy co-existence between Burundi's coalition
government, led by the majority Hutu tribe, and the army, which is
dominated by the minority Tutsis.
Tens of thousands of people have died in two years of conflict between
the army and Hutu rebels, who control land in the north.
Despite moves towards pluralist politics, the Tutsi army has refused
to open its ranks to members of the Hutu majority. Militias from both
sides now threaten to torpedo the collaboration between the government
and army.
Neighbouring Rwanda has a similar ethnic mix. Last year an estimated
one million Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered in a
genocidal campaign instigated by the then Hutu-led government, army, and
militias.--Reuter

Michael Tumelty meets Joseph Swensen, an explosive choice as the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra's new principal conductor
BACK in January, an unexpected bomb exploded on the Scottish music
scene. It went off in a concert by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. The
incendiary device was Beethoven's Eroica Symphony, and the man with the
finger on the trigger was a conductor called Joseph Swensen.
Swensen had never been to the SCO before as conductor. He had been to
Scotland in his capacity as an international solo violinist. But what
happened that week in Scotland is still being talked about.
No Eroica like it had been heard. At the hands of Swensen, who erupted
acrobatically and volcanically into the music, the stupendous
performance recalled directly the musical revolution that formed the
background to the composition itself, nearly 200 years ago.
Swensen was dynamite. The SCO played out of their skins -- one of the
players remarked that he himself didn't know they could play so
ferociously. It was electric enough for Roy McEwan, managing director of
the SCO, to confirm the reactions of his own orchestra, then immediately
set off in hot pursuit of Swensen for future engagements.
McEwan and the SCO, taking a hell of a risk, went the whole hog, and
yesterday announced the appointment of Joseph Swensen as principal
conductor. The post begins next autumn, and will run for an initial
period of three years, with Swensen in residence for six weeks in his
first season, and eight weeks in each thereafter.
McEwan, announcing Swensen's appointment yesterday, said that with the
quality of orchestras now beginning to pursue Swensen, he thinks that
the SCO have got him ''in the nick of time''.
Swensen, who is 35 and New York born, has had a very public career
with a private agenda that he chose not to reveal until about seven
years ago.
Of Japanese and Norwegian parentage, Swensen has been steeped in music
since birth. His mother (the Japanese side) is a pianist, and his father
a clarinettist. Young Swensen himself was a multi-instrumentalist by his
teens, having learned to play all the band instruments (except oboe)
that his father taught at a school in a crime-ridden area of the Bronx.
His specialities however were piano, for which he was accepted by the
Julliard School at the age of seven, and violin, which he had been
playing since five, and which became his major subject at the Julliard
when he was 10.
There was no formal launch to his career as a violinist, said Swensen,
in Scotland this week to conduct four concerts with his new band. ''I
was asked to play the Mendelssohn concerto at 13, which was not part of
my plan,'' he says. ''Little by little the concerts multiplied, then
came the recordings, and before I knew it I was travelling all the time
as a violinist.''
All the while his highly successful career was developing, however, he
nursed his private agenda, which he had outlined to his father when he
was only nine. All Joseph Swensen wanted to do was conduct. Following
his father's advice, he let it lie and focused on a playing career, but
the young violinist was never in any doubt about what he wanted to do.
''Playing the violin was just part of my education,'' he says. ''I
thought perhaps it was a good idea to do it because I'd meet a lot of
conductors. Now one of the reasons I'm a conductor is so that I don't
have to meet other conductors.''
Swensen as violinist had as rough a time with inept conductors as most
soloists do. ''It was frustrating until I realised that I could probably
learn more from the really bad ones than the good ones: what works, what
doesn't work; though that kind of education is a limited one.''
Joseph Swensen, who switched full-time to conducting in 1991, has
little time for conductors who are into ''the power trip, the career,
the profile, and the ego''.
He is quite clear on the function of a conductor. He is a catalyst.
''There's a key to every orchestra's potential; if the conductor can
find the right lock to open, then magic is possible.''
Note the emphasis. This man, evidently, is of a very rare breed of
conductors who realises that much of the secret lies within the
orchestra itself: ''Every conductor must be the servant not only of the
music, but also of the orchestra. And by the time we get to a concert
this orchestra -- the SCO -- can play no matter what a conductor does.''
Swensen is unequivocal about them: ''Of all the orchestras I've worked
with this is the one where I can be completely natural; it's a kind of
chemistry, not entirely unlike meeting someone who becomes a good friend
or a lover.''
He well recalls that famous Eroica performance himself: ''It was one
of the highlights of my musical life. When you have something like that
after such a short time, then the possibilities for other experiences,
for growth, become very exciting.''
And he's convinced that the huge success of that performance, which
was like an enormous catharsis, was to do with intimacy. ''Most of us
are afraid of intimacy,'' he says. ''But intimacy is the missing element
in the musical experience more often than not.
''It's like leaving yourself open, like becoming completely yourself;
as soon as you've done that, you're at your most vulnerable. And once
you can allow yourself to be vulnerable, you can release the musical
potential and allow the orchestra to do it.''
The sense of mutual trust that is implicit in such self-exposure, is,
one suspects, the key to Swensen's success. It will certainly be tested
in his period of tenure with the SCO, during which he proposes to
undertake the full range of repertoire -- ''I love the whole spectrum,
from the driest Stravinsky to the most pornographic Wagner -- including
some of his own music (Swensen also composes) and contemporary Scottish
music, beginning this week with James MacMillan's first major orchestral
work, Tryst.
* SCO/Joseph Swensen -- Tonight: Ayr Town Hall, 7.30pm; Tomorrow:
Music Hall, Aberdeen, 7.30pm; Saturday: Queen's Hall, Edinburgh, 7.45pm.

<TEXT>
TELECOM regulator Oftel accused Labour of promoting a monopoly in its
groundbreaking deal with British Telecom to connect schools, hospitals,
and libraries to the information super highway.
Oftel director general Don Cruickshank said institutions should be
given a choice over which company links them to the Internet.
Labour had pledged to allow BT to sell home entertainment services
such as films and game shows to domestic customers in return for the
#15bn hook-up.
The deal formed the centrepiece of Opposition Leader Tony Blair's
Brighton conference speech last month.
However, Mr Cruickshank said that while recognising the goal of
linking the institutions to the super highway was correct, he disagreed
with free cabling being provided by BT alone.
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 last night, Mr Cruickshank said: ''We can
deliver a mechanism of universal service but it will not be monopolistic
and should not be a monopolistic supply by BT.''
He added: ''I think schools should have a choice. They should not be
obliged to hook up to BT.''
Labour spokeswoman for trade and industry, Mrs Margaret Beckett, said
she was surprised by Mr Cruickshank's comments. ''It is complete
nonsense to suggest that Labour is promoting a monopoly,'' she said.
''What Labour is doing is promoting competition by lifting the
prohibition to allow BT into the market for cable companies.
''It is Labour that wants to open up the market to competition, it is
the Government that is preventing it.''
Mr Cruickshank told Radio 5's The Financial World Tonight programme
that he had been on holiday at the time of Mr Blair's Brighton
conference speech.

FOR one day only next year, Sunday, June 2, cinemagoers throughout the
United Kingdom will be able to go to the pictures for #1 to celebrate
the centenary of the cinema. Announcing the cut-price birthday party,
which will be held in some 700 cinemas nationwide, Lord Attenborough,
chairman of Cinema 100's national council, said yesterday in London that
the aim was to ''bring the celebrations to the people.''
He said that on March 7 the ''Premiere of the Century'' would be held
in the Empire, Leicester Square, exactly 100 years to the day since the
first English cinema opened on the site. A brand new film would be
premiered, and he promised the premiere, attended by international stars
from past and present, would be the most spectacular movie event ever
seen.
The launch of Cinema 100's programme took the Scottish organisers by
surprise. Their plans are still to be finalised, and were not due to be
unveiled until early next month. They will include a gala at the
Festival Theatre in Edinburgh on April 13, the date the first film in
Scotland was shown there 100 years ago.
Glasgow will hold its celebrations on May 26 in the MGM Cinema,
Sauchiehall Street, the site of the ice rink in which the first film was
shown in 1896. Mayfest is being extended a day to accommodate the event.
The Cinema 100 programme, launched yesterday in London by Lord
Attenborough, is a nationwide event, but the details he gave showed a
marked English bias. Scotland is doing its own thing, and one of the
highlights will be the screening at GFT of a silent film, The Italian,
made in 1915, directed by Reginald Baker who came from Bothwell, which
is being restored by the Library of Congress.
The film, long unseen, even the organisers have yet to see it, is said
to have provided visual references for Coppola's The Godfather.
The 50th anniversary of the Edinburgh Film Festival next year will
also provide an opportunity to celebrate the centenary with a double
birthday party. Edinburgh is Britain's oldest film festival, the leading
showcase for international films in Britain, whatever the
Johnny-come-lately London Film Festival and the television film pundit,
Mr Barry Norman, may claim. The director, Mark Cousins plans to make
full use of the occasion.
There will be a retrospective of films released in 1947, the year of
Edinburgh's birth, and a season of films, made for the cinema and
television, which have changed the world.
Other events during the year are -- Scotland, the Movie Book by David
Bruce, which will cover the history of cinema in Scotland; a series of
black and white shorts from the Scottish Film Archive to be shown in
local cinemas; an exhibition, Behind the Scenes, which will tour cinema
foyers; Centenary Reels, a short film contest run in conjunction with
Scottish Television, aimed at giving young film-makers a start; a
multi-media show at the Tramway in October involving performers from the
Netherlands and France sponsored by Glasgow's Department of Performing
Arts and Venues; and a special film education programme for Scottish
schools.
In addition 30 commemorative plaques will be erected throughout
Scotland, although the omissions -- a 150 names were submitted -- may
cause controversy. Among those honoured are Donald Crisp, Duncan Macrae,
Finlay Currie and George Singleton.
Lord Attenborough said the events would reach beyond cinemas into
schools, galleries and concert halls, television, postage stamps,
records and the radio. The BBC is planning a series of programmes on
Radios 3 and 4 of plays based on famous films, features and stories
about the cinema.

HE dedicated the show to Ruby Constance, the new-born daughter of
''the most famous dykes in London'' and he proved to be a jewel himself,
with his bright, shiny prose. He favours a simple, brisk style, full of
detail yet unfussy all the same, and he delivers his work with a
singularly cool lack of pretension, peppering the completely absorbing
passages with laconic ad hoc asides, interrupting one evocation of a
fussy female to confide: ''That's my sister-in-law.''
This one-off Glasgay! reading by writer/performer Neil Bartlett packed
out the Stalls Studio. ''Are you sitting comfortably,'' he inquired
ironically of the squashed-up audience. Then he began, and we forgot our
discomfort and savoured his economic distillations, of love, of lust, of
friendships and of family.
Thoughtful and precisely observed, his writing bristles with wit. In a
passage from his novel Need to Catch Him As He Falls, the character Boy
is offered advice about desire, symbolised by a longed-for frock: ''If
you can't buy it, steal it. If you can't steal it copy it. If you can't
copy it buy a postcard of it. And if you can't afford the postcard . . .
sort your life out.''
His body is a temple to vanity and hedonism. Some unnecessary costume
changes -- a leather jacket removed, a T-shirt stripped off, a
long-sleeved shirt shrugged on -- revealed a muscled torso but he drew
deep on fags throughout. He read out the passages in a voice soft with
insinuation but his creativity, his command of language and of
relationships, rang out loud and clear. How he sparkled.

Theatre
It's a very long time since I read Alasdair Gray's epic novel. The
complexities of its structure, the names of characters and plot lines
had not stayed in my memory. A fine situation, I felt, to come fresh to
TAG's production, ending its run, begun at the Edinburgh Festival, very
aptly, in the city which spawned the novel.
In any case, an adaptation takes on its own theatrical life, when it
hits the stage. It should be judged in its own right, independent of its
previous existence. So, did Lanark, the play, cut it as a piece of drama
?
Staged in a cold, harsh world of ramps and platforms, stark shadows
and sickly yellow and purple lighting, director Tony Graham, with
designer Angela Davies, opted for a minimalist- Expressionist angle on
the piece.
On-stage musicians, and two opera singers in the cast, providing an
almost continual musical under-score, took us further down this path.
Graham and his creative team were giving us the universal odyssey,
replete with the big themes of love and death.
What they missed (and, admittedly, something had to be left out in the
adaptation) was the tangible sense of place, the very Glasgowness and
quirky specificity of the novel, the things that make it linger in the
mind.
Despite some lovely moments of pawky Glaswegian wisdom and a clutch of
fine performances, the production ultimately had little substance,
coming across as a somewhat bland, rootless and superficial reworking of
the Expressionist nightmare vision of man's helplessness in an
overwhelming mechanised society.

William Russell views the best and worst film-makers can muster with a
sleazy thriller, a feel-good Parisian romance, and an enchanting story
of companionship
THE heights and depths of present-day film-making are in evidence this
week. The heights are achieved by Michael Radford's utterly beguiling Il
Postino, about the friendship between the exiled Chilean poet, Pablo
Neruda, and a young Italian fisherman who became his postman, and how
this unlikely relationship liberated him from the limitations of his
poverty stricken background.
The depths are plumbed by Jade, William Friedkin's appalling, sleazy,
sexually over-explicit thriller about corruption in high places, a film
which both lends a new meaning to the F-word and leaves a bad taste.
Hollywood's reputation is saved, however, by the third film of the
week, Lawrence Kasdan's flibbertigibbet comedy, French Kiss, in which
Meg Ryan, the Doris Day of today, goes to France and meets Kevin Kline
playing what one can only call a Frog who would a-wooing go.
But the damage done by Jade is considerable; we expected better of
Friedkin, who has some distinguished films to his name. Linda
Fiorentino, the memorable, murderous femme fatale in The Last Seduction,
plays the wife of a wealthy San Francisco lawyer (Chas Palmentieri) who
becomes a murder suspect after a wealthy socialite -- she was his last
visitor -- is found brutally murdered with her fingerprints on the
murder weapon. The brew is made even richer by the discovery of
photographs in his safe showing the governor of California (Richard
Crenna) up to no good with a woman.
The assistant district attorney in charge of the case, the dreary
ginger-topped David Caruso from NYPD Blue, a former lover, still carries
a torch for Fiorentino and withholds vital evidence from the police.
Glossily photographed and lavishly set, this big-budget film contains,
to be fair, a couple of thrillingly photographed car chases, something
of a Friedkin speciality -- his past work includes The French
Connection.
The problems start when Joe Eszterhas's woefully constructed plot
starts to unfold. The socialite, a degenerate, uses his luxurious beach
house as a place for rich and powerful men to have sex with the
prostitutes he provides, photographs their activities, and blackmails
them. One of them, a no-holds-barred lady who takes her sex every which
way, is the Jade of the title. One could live with that, but Friedkin
shows too much of the sexual perversities Jade gets up to with her
customers for anyone's peace of mind, and the film salivates over the
goings on.
If Miss Fiorentino performed anything like what she appears to
perform, because it is no surprise to discover she is Jade, she should
be ashamed of herself. But so should everybody connected with this
expensive, dirty film.
I have not given the ending away by revealing that Fiorentino is Jade,
in case you wish to see for yourselves, because Eszterhas's plot has
more twists than that, although you will be wasting your time and money.
In Lawrence Kasdan's French Kiss, Meg Ryan plays Kate, an American
Francophobe school teacher engaged to Charlie (Timothy Hutton) who,
because she is afraid of flying, refuses to accompany him on a business
trip to Paris. Once there Charlie falls in love with a French girl, and
jilts Kate who refuses to accept the situation, and conquers her fear of
flying and the French.
And who should be sitting next to her on the plane but Luc (Kevin
Kline replete with worn black leather jacket, several days growth of
beard, endless packets of Gauloises, and the funniest French accent
since Clouseau) some sort of jewel thief cum vine smuggler who hides his
loot in Meg's bag on the grounds that customs will not bother with her.
You can pretty well take it from there. Kate loses bag, passport, and
money, Luc has to find the bag and his jewels, a comic French policeman
(Jean Reno) gives chase, Kate meets Charlie, Kate realises it is Luc she
loves after all, and everyone lives happily ever after.
These daft goings on occur in front of the usual tourist spots
photographed in glorious Technicolor and the result is neither good nor
bad. Maybe Miss Ryan is getting a little long in the tooth for such
jejune goings on, but that did not stop role model Doris carrying on
past her sell-by date, so no doubt it will not stop her.
French Kiss delivers what it sets out to achieve -- harmless, if vapid
entertainment.
There is much meatier, and wholly more satisfying, fare delivered by
Il Postino. In 1952 Pablo Neruda, who had been exiled by the Chilean
regime, was given sanctuary by the Italian government, but on condition
that he lived on one of the remote islands off Naples. The local
postmaster, overwhelmed by the mail this illustrious resident was
receiving, advertised for help and the advertisement was answered by
Mario Ruppolo (Massimo Troisi), a young fisherman desperate to escape
the tyranny of the sea.
As the daily visits increase the two men become friends, and Neruda
(Philippe Noiret), intrigued by the young man's natural love of words,
introduces him to poetry, teaches him the use of metaphor -- a
scandalous state of affairs as far as the beloved's aunt is concerned --
and encourages his interest in politics and the world beyond the island
which is a prison to them both in different ways. As Mario's horizons
are enlarged he begins to have opinions of his own and is transformed
from gangling swain into a man of firmly held, carefully thought out
views.
He adopts his friend's communism, realises what charlatans the local
politicians are, forever promising and never delivering. And when,
tongue-tied and shy with love, he wants to woo Beatrice (Maria Grazia
Cucinotte), the pretty niece of the dragon lady (Linda Moretti) who runs
the seaport bar, he turns to Neruda for help.
Eventually Neruda's exile ends, he leaves the island, and the story
takes a darker turn when the demands of life as an international
celebrity and a Chilean politician take prominence over his friendship
with Mario. When eventually Neruda and his wife Matilde return to the
island, it is too late.
Friendship has its obligations and he has failed in his.
Massimo Troisi, who died aged 41 from heart disease immediately after
completing the film, although not particularly well-known abroad, was an
extremely popular Italian comedian in direct line from the great
Neapolitan actors and directors like Eduardo De Filippo and Toto. He
gives a charming, heartwarming performance, catching Mario's naivety,
his bashfulness, and his growing confidence to perfection, as well as
showing his stubborn refusal to admit, after Neruda has left, that maybe
his beloved friend has forgotten him.
He is a simple man, but not a simpleton. Noiret, one of European
cinema's greatest actors -- he was Alfredo, the old cinema projectonist
in Cinema Paradiso -- is simply magnificent as Neruda.
The film was directed by Michael Radford who became friends with
Troisi when setting up Another Time, Another Place 13 years ago in
Aberdeenshire. He wanted the Italian to play one of the prisoners of
war, but Troisi refused, unwilling to brave the Scottish climate. When
he was thinking of making a film of Antonio Skarmetta's novel, Burning
Patience, about Neruda and Mario he turned to Radford. Radford
questioned the wisdom of an English director making an Italian film, but
Troisi replied -- ''We are trying to make a film of which our sons can
be proud.'' They did.

FORTY years of dance-making -- from radical stand-still in the fifties
to last year's funny capers to looney novelty tunes -- can scarcely be
compressed into one, or even two, mixed bills. So this current
anniversary world tour by the Paul Taylor Dance Company comes across as
more like a sharing of favourite or significant moments from a family
album.
There's the sunny day -- Aureole -- when Handel's music is like a
frisky breeze that makes everyone want to kick up their heels, act giddy
and carefree as if optimism could really be a safeguard against daily
woes.
And there's that day on the beach -- Spindrift -- when the sense of
happiness was as changeable as the weather. When a wash of overcast
steeliness left the suddenly solitary man aware of life's transience,
its fickle camaraderie that ebbs and flows like tides.
Set to Schoenberg's String Quartet Concerto (after Handel) this is an
exquisite piece, full of subtle light and shade. The dancers, costumed
in strong pastels -- coral, yellow, turquoise, bone -- have an elemental
insouciance about them as they gather and depart like capering foam on a
wave while, singular and yearning to be a part of their, indeed any,
togetherness is the singular man who is cast up in their midst.
Likewise Company B -- danced to the evocative strains of the Andrews
Sisters -- is brightness shadowed by reality. As the girls and boys get
together in a series of sassy, utterly intricate and demanding solos and
ensembles, there come bleak reminders of when this music was current:
bodies will suddenly fall to the floor, a silhouetted line of men will
march away, the piece itself will close with a melting, drifting apart.
The bugle boy is calling the men to war and dance how you may it's not
to be avoided.
As for Profiles, this is the album shot which shows the mood
experimental. Four figures morph-like in flesh coloured unitards offer
stark near-hieroglyphs that semaphore the mobility of their bodies as
well as the flexibility of their moods and relationships.

CLYDE FC and Cumbernauld Development Corporation confirmed last night
they were involved in a wrangle over service charges for Broadwood
Stadium in Cumbernauld which the football club occupied in February,
1993.
Both parties said it amounted to a ''run of the mill'' landlord and
tenant dispute and dismissed a suggestion it could lead to eviction for
the second division club.
Club chairman John McBeth said: ''There is no money being withheld.
There is a dispute about what the levels of service charge should be.
The corporation is using the stadium as much as the club is. I am
confident the matter, which is purely technical, will be resolved.''
Mr Donald McLean, an officer with CDC, confirmed confidential
discussions had been held with the club's officials. ''I don't think it
would be appropriate to say anything further at this stage. I would be
very surprised if the matter led to Clyde being evicted. There are
always things to be sorted out between landlords and tenants but they do
not always necessarily end up with evictions.''
Part of the problem appears to stem from the development corporation's
need to ''clear its decks'' before being wound up in December next year.
At that point, ownership of the #10m stadium is likely to be passed to
the new North Lanarkshire unitary authority, with Clyde remaining as
tenants in the 6000-seat ground. The second phase of end stands will
cost #2m.
Broadwood, used seven days a week by the local community, has a
gymnasium, five-a-side pitches, full-size synthetic pitch, and bars and
restaurants.

CLAIMS by Scottish Nuclear's former director of safety that
privatisation of the nuclear industry is fraught with danger were
attacked in the Commons yesterday by Energy Minister Tim Eggar.
The Herald disclosed two weeks ago that Captain Richard Killick is to
go before a Commons committee to say he fears that low morale,
overworked operators and the rush to reduce costs before privatisation
pose a threat of a ''significant reduction in safety.
The issue was raised in the Commons yesterday by Labour MP David
Hanson (Delyn), who said that the Government should at least abandon the
privatisation while it looked at safety concerns.
Mr Eggar told him: ''I read about Captain Killick's allegations and I
asked for a full report. At no time while he was employed by Scottish
Nuclear did he ever raise these concerns with the company, nor with the
Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations, nor with the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate, nor with my department.
''It is only since he left the company that these concerns have
surfaced. If he has genuine concerns about safety, the first place to
take them is the NII, but he has chosen instead to go to the Member for
Cunninghame North (Mr Brian Wilson) and to the press. It is very
irresponsible for him to have raised this in the way he has.''
Mr George Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley -- Lab.) followed
up Mr Hanson's attack, questioning why the Minister had been so
dismissive of Captain Killick's remarks, bearing in mind that he had
spent a lifetime in the industry.
Mr Foulkes said that if, in the circumstances, the Government pressed
ahead with this ''crazy privatisation,'' it would be ''further evidence
of a frenetic lurch to the right.''
Mr Eggar told him: ''I would take Captain Killick's comments more
seriously if he had raised them with Scottish Nuclear or taken them up
with NII. Scaremongering about the nuclear industry is highly
irresponsible and this House should have no part of it.''
On a point of order later, Mr Wilson protested to the Speaker: ''It is
absurd to suggest that a constituent cannot approach his own MP and
raise matters of public concern rather than go to a Government intent on
legislation that he thinks will cause problems.''
Captain Killick said last night: ''This will not alter anything at
all. I firmly intend to go the Trade and Industry Select Committee
(currently conducting an inquiry into nuclear privatisation) and say my
piece. Nothing I have said is in any way changed by what Tim Eggar has
said about me.''

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson will tell The Herald's
Challenge of Change conference in Edinburgh today that the temporary
ceasefire after the appointment of Michael Forsyth to the Scottish
Office has been cruelly shattered.
In little more than 100 days, Mr Forsyth, according to his Labour
counterpart, has gone from being a listening Scottish Secretary to being
a shouting Scottish Secretary. He has lurched to the Right along with
the rest of the Tory Party.
Mr Robertson will argue that the ''increasingly hysterical and
targeted attacks'' on local government by Ministers are nothing more
than an attempt to soften up Scotland's councils for yet another round
of Tory spending cuts in the Budget.
He will claim that the Scottish Secretary has begun to take revenge on
Scotland's councils following the Tories' failure to win control of a
single authority in the local polls earlier this year.
''The attacks are a smokescreen designed to divert attention away from
Michael Forsyth's real agenda, which is to make Scotland's councils pay
for the Tory wipeout at the polls,'' Mr Robertson will say.
He will also denounce as ''a con trick'' Mr Forsyth's expressed desire
to return powers to local authorities.
The conference will also be addressed by Scottish Local Government
Minister George Kynoch, who recently has attacked some councils for
employing too many highly-paid senior staff and creating old-fashioned,
top-heavy internal structures.
Another keynote speaker is Cosla's Labour president Councillor
Rosemary McKenna.

GREENOCK and Port Glasgow MP Norman Godman called yesterday for
fairness in terms of shipbuilding orders.
He claimed that yards in Scotland were being affected by the use of
shipbuilding intervention funds by countries such as Italy and Spain,
and pointed out that in recent years the number of yards on Clydeside
had declined from 32 to three.
While Kvaerner Govan recently had won an order, the three remaining
yards were in a ''perilous condition'' and he called on the Government
to do more to help British yards.
Junior Trade Minister Ian Taylor said that efforts were being made to
ensure there was a fairer basis for international competition, and told
the House: ''We must do more to improve the competitiveness of ships
bearing the Red Ensign.''

PEERS broke with centuries of tradition last night and backed plans to
set up a register of their financial interests.
Despite warnings that it would change the character of the House, the
Lords agreed to follow MPs' example and publish an annual register.
The move, approved without a vote, comes after Lord Nolan's report on
standards in public life.
In a four-hour debate, the overwhelming majority of speakers backed
the proposals put forward by Lord Griffiths' sub-committee on ways of
ensuring high standards of conduct.
However, Tory Lord Campbell of Alloway, arguing against a register,
said it would involve ''a fundamental change of principle as to the
nature of the House and the way it operates''.
Senior Tory Lord Boyd-Carpenter also said it was ''wrong and foolish
to introduce a complex and complicated system of registration,'' which
would undermine the tradition that peers speak on their honour.
Introducing his sub-committee's report, former Law Lord Lord Griffiths
was cheered when he told a packed Chamber: ''Lords should act always on
their personal honour.
''Lords should never accept any financial inducement as an incentive
or reward for exercising parliamentary influence.''
The register will be less comprehensive than that required of MPs and
will not include any details of payments. However, it will cover
arrangements, such as consultancies, where peers accept payment for
providing parliamentary advice or services.
Lord Griffiths said that while about 30% of MPs were shown to be paid
parliamentary consultants, only a fraction of peers, perhaps 1% or 2%,
were in the same position.
Lords Leader Viscount Cranborne said the change represented a very
substantial departure from the custom of the Lords, but the status quo
was not sustainable in the current climate.
With Lord Nolan present for the debate, Lords Opposition leader Lord
Richard welcomed the committee's report and recommendations.
He warned: ''The public perception of politicians, particularly in the
Commons, now seems to be at an almost all-time low.''
Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, said
he had ''mixed and cautious'' feelings about the issue: ''But some
change in our procedure is inevitable and probably desirable.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday announced a review of
flood prevention legislation. The review will consider whether councils
should be obliged to provide a level of flood prevention to property in
their area.
The Government may be able to introduce legislation at some point in
the new session of Parliament, beginning on November 15, possibly with
all-party support.
The move was was warmly welcomed by representatives of families in the
south end of Paisley who had to move out of their homes during floods
last December.
Mr Gordon McMaster, Labour MP for Paisley South -- who led a
deputation from the south end's action committee to the Scottish Office
in London yesterday -- said: ''This means that the four hundred or so
families who have returned to their homes after having their lives
devastated can do so safe in the knowledge that such floods are unlikely
to happen again.''
Mr Forsyth said: ''Many councils have already carried out work to
protect local people from the misery of flood damage to their homes but
there is no compulsion for them to do so.
''Others do not have a good record and have failed to defend areas
which have a history of flooding.''
He criticised Strathclyde Regional Council, which he said had wide
powers to protect non-agricultural land in Paisley from flooding but had
used them only once to carry out a prevention scheme.
Mr Forsyth said he was pleased to hear that the council agreed
directly to spend significant sums on works of maintenance and repair
and on studies for flood prevention schemes.
However, he added: ''It is a matter of regret not just to me but to
their taxpayers as well that they have chosen not to promote any
flood-prevention scheme which would address the underlying problems once
and for all.
Mr Forsyth asked Mr McMaster to discuss the future role of local
authorities with Strathlcyde.
The Paisley MP said that while the Minister had given the Paisley
deputation what they had asked for, the Government would have to provide
councils with the resources to carry out new flood prevention duties.
At present, although regional and islands councils have permissive
powers to carry out flood prevention works they are not obliged to do
so.
The main responsibility lies with the owner, either though providing
their own defences or insurance or a combination of both.
A spokeswoman for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said
last night that she could not comment on individual councils.However,
she added that when water and sewerage functions transfer to the new
authorities next April, the new Scottish Environment Protection Agency
will have the powers to designate flood protection schemes.
''The difficulty in producing schemes are that the pros and cons of
spending have to be considered, bearing in mind Government restraints on
local authority spending,'' she said.
Mr Forsyth's announcement was condemned by the Scottish National
Party. Ms Roseanna Cunningham, MP for Perth and Kinross -- another area
which has suffered severe flooding in the past -- claimed that Mr
Forsyth was ''trying to pass the buck without spending a cent''.
''There has been a need for Government action on the issue of flood
prevention for many years now. But the actionn that was needed was not
the hand-washing exercise which Michael Forsyth has embarked on.
''Forsyth wants to ensure that, in future, local authorities take the
lead in flood prevention. But he has made no mention of any extra cash
to enable local authorities to meet this new responsibility'', she
added.

''There have been a number of unsubstantiated allegations made and, in

WRANGLING over the Budget started early yesterday when a keynote
speech by Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown to business leaders was
combined with a Labour newspaper advertising campaign and news
conference designed to focus attention on the ''under-performance'' of
the economy rather than the Tory agenda of tax cuts.
Mr Brown pledged to pursue the Government up to the General Election
over the reversal in Britain's economic fortunes despite the North Sea
oil industry.
Mr Brown insisted: ''The real issue for this Budget is not the Tory 1p
or 2p down or the Liberal 1p or 2p up, but by how much we can end the
chronic under-investment in our economy.
''Only by investing in our future can taxes be kept low and public
services strong.''
Unveiling his alternative plans, Mr Brown said Labour would:
* Double tax allowances for new investment in plant and machinery for
12 months.
* Introduce a two-tier capital gains tax to encourage shareholders to
hold assets over the long-term, rather than scrap the tax as John Major
wants.
* Create incentives for long-term savings through Tessas and PEPs with
long-term tax advantages.
* Use its proposed windfall tax on the privatised utilities to raise
the VAT threshold for small businesses which are prepared to take on
extra employees.
* Create a new task force to encourage investment partnerships between
the public and private sectors.
* Introduce measures to improve training through individual training
accounts, a new University for Industry and an obligation on employers
to make a proper contribution towards training.
Financial Secretary to the Treasury Michael Jack said: ''Gordon
Brown's proposals on tax are a dance of the seven veils. He lets one or
two slip, but he won't show us the complete package.''
He claimed Labour would have to increase taxes in order to pay for
their programme and challenged Mr Brown to ''come clean'' on whether he
would raise corporation tax.

THE Government's plans for pre-school education vouchers were given a
guarded welcome yesterday by the Scottish Consumer Council.
In its response to the consultation paper on giving parents a voucher
worth #1100 to ''buy'' a place at a nursery or playgroup, the council
says the scheme could succeed.
It believes the proposal, greeted with scepticism by nursery
providers, playgroups, local authorities, and some parents' groups,
could expand pre-school education, provided some key issues are
addressed.
Ms Deirdre Hutton, chairman of the council, said: ''There are many
issues to be investigated before we can be satisfied that giving parents
vouchers will create the sort of provision that will benefit all
pre-school children.
'' We need to be certain that the market in which nursery provision
develops is fair and open so that the benefits of competition can be
realised.''
The Government wants to create a market to meet the demand for places,
with local authority and private nurseries and playgroups competing for
the vouchers.
However, critics have argued that places will not increase because
there is no provision for capital expenditure.
The council points out that expenditure per place varies from about
#670 to more than #3000 between local authorities. Therefore, a
realistic value for vouchers cannot be decided.
It argues that local authorities must be given the same borrowing
facilities as private companies if there is to be a level field in the
market for vouchers.
The council also expressed its concern for children with special
needs.
''Early support for children with special needs is vital and we
believe should be explicitly included,'' the council stated.
There should also be consultation on provision for children for whom a
record of needs is opened and for others considered to be at risk.
0 The Government says it has had sufficient positive responses from
local authorities for a pilot voucher scheme next year, ahead of full
implementation.
Critics argue that the pre-five expertise built up by local
authorities should not be exposed to the vagaries of the market.
The Government expects an #1100 voucher to buy a part-time place in a
nursery and up to a full-time place in a playgroup.
Parents would be able to top up the value if they used the voucher in
the private or voluntary sector but local authorities would not be able
to charge more than #1100.
Opponents say that less well-off families dependent on council
provision would be put at a disadvantage compared with those which would
be able to put the voucher to the cost of private nursery education.
According to the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, most parents want
local authorities to be responsible for their children's pre-schooling.

A DELEGATION of Tory MPs is due to meet Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay at
Westminster tonight to throw their support behind his controversial
plans for divorce law reform. The delegation includes former
Conservative Minister Peter Bottomley.
A spokesman for Lord Mackay's department 0 said the delegation was
understood to be supportive of the Lord Chancellor's proposals to reform
the divorce laws.
The meeting comes amid widespread concern within the Tory Party --
said to have spread to the Cabinet -- that such a controversial measure
as the Divorce Reform Bill should be introduced in the Queen's Speech,
in the run-up to a General Election.
The future of the Bill could be raised at today's Cabinet meeting.
Government sources have so far insisted they remain ''confident'' that
the Divorce Bill would be in the legislative programme to be announced
in the Queen's Speech on November 15.
At the same time they have effectively left themselves a get-out, by
pointing out that the Speech's contents may have to be revised in the
light of the forthcoming public spending settlement.

THE Child Support Agency costs eight times as much to run as it saves
the taxpayer by helping lone parents off benefit, the Liberal Democrats
claimed yesterday.
At the same time, complaints about it are increasing, the party said.
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown told reporters at Westminster:
''We are the only party that is committed to repealing the CSA
legislation and replacing it with a family court system, with a
beefed-up collection agency.
''It is now clear that the CSA is costing more than the Liable
Relatives Unit it replaced.''
He said more constituents were coming to him with complaints about the
CSA, ranging from ''injustice'' to bureaucratic delay, than about any
other issue.
Social Security spokeswoman Liz Lynne added: ''The CSA is the white
elephant of the 1990s.
''It costs #192m a year to run, and it is saving the taxpayer less and
less.
''In the financial year to April, 1995, only #24m was saved by the CSA
collecting the maintenance payments.''
She said Government figures showed that in the calendar year 1994,
8818 people were taken off Income Support because increased maintenance
payments lifted them over the benefit threshold.
By the end of August this year, only 2939 people had been removed from
the benefit.

POLITICS again resembled football yesterday. There was more trouble on
the terraces, this time from where you would expect it.
''Try to behave like the adults you are supposed to be'' referee Betty
snapped as hooligans from the rival supporters clubs swopped insults
from the terraces below the gangway.
Betty threatened to send Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley -- Lab.) out of
the ground for some ripe abuse, but she also showed the yellow card to
the Tories opposite.
Both groups, as is often the way during matches, were concentrating on
enjoying old animosities, rather than watching the play.
The Opposition took over the role of sports writers. They had been
ready to sack the current manager of Britain United for three years now.
Now they produced another reason why ''Major must go.'' The Prime
Minister must vie with Terry Venables for the prize of most endangered
species of the year.
The reason, as it often is when the hacks turn against a manager, was
our position in the league. Britain United had dropped from 13th to 18th
place in the world prosperity league, they chorused.
Well, not chorused. But hardly a Labour MP rose without reciting this
statistic like a gloomy mantra. They know it must be right, because
Labour had taken an advert in The Times saying it was.
In 1979 when Honest Jim Callaghan ran the team we were 13th they
shrilled, forgetting that the sports writers then had called that season
United's ''Winter of Discontent.''
Now we had plummeted to 18th. There it was. If this is a two-up,
two-down league, we are left under Major's direction with only Sweden
and New Zealand standing between us and relegation to the second
division.
If it's four and four, then we and Singapore look as if we are for the
high jump. Wait a minute -- Singapore? And look at who is topping this
league -- Luxembourg, apparently the Rangers of world prosperity.
The Trade and Industry Ministers' response to these calls for
managerial and boardroom sackings followed the usual lines of soccer
press conferences before the old guard actually leave. The lads have
actually been playing blinders. Iceland -- in seventh place -- have had
all the luck going. We've been playing some beautiful football even if
we haven't been winning enough matches.
Mr Ian Lang, an assistant trainer, complained at the critics were not
looking at the good points in our performance. But what the Labour hacks
wanted was performnce, investment in new players, a new supremo.
Mrs Margaret Beckett said that under the present lot Britain United
simply wasn't competitive enough. Remember, when Callaghan was running
the team they were 13th.
How many fans, one wondered, would be satisfied with a promise to take
the team back to 13th place. And indeed when club members vet a new
board they have to be inquiring about what is really on offer.
The alternative management have not actually promised to take the team
back into 13th place. Their prospectus says ''The Tories would settle
for 18th best. New Labour will not.''
One can just hear manager Blair and trainer Brown asserting a couple
of seasons ahead that 17th place is not so bad when you consider the
surprise late run by Formosa Orient and Monaco Villa.

LABOUR MP George Galloway is confident he will beat off comfortably a
selection challenge in the new Kelvin seat when his current Glasgow
Hillhead constituency is redrawn, according to his supporters.
Mr Galloway declined to discuss the matter yesterday, saying he was
forbidden by the selection procedure rules to comment. Challenger Shiona
Waldron said she was unable to take calls during working hours at her
office in Dumbarton, where she is a procurator fiscal-depute.
Supporters of Mr Galloway said the latest challenge to the MP was
''10% the laudable aim of putting more women up for selection and 90% a
continuation of the civil war in the constituency dating back to 1986,''
between the more working class districts and the more affluent
middle-class areas.
The MP was previously challenged by Mrs Tricia Godman, wife of
Greenock and Port Glasgow MP Norman Godman. This time, Mrs Godman is
understood to have proposed Ms Waldron's nomination.
Ms Waldon first came to public attention as convener of the board of
managers of Jordanhill School in 1988. In April that year, she stressed
that there was no conflict between the teachers on the board and head
teacher Alastair Cram.
Within six months, the board had suspended the headmaster for a second
time and a month later Ms Waldron submitted her resignation from the
board and from her job with a voluntary services organisation in Glasgow
to take up law studies.
Now she has emerged as a challanger to Mr Galloway, being put forward
by the women's section of the new constituency party and winning by 42
votes to 19 the nomination from the Hyndland/Hillhead branch on Tuesday
night.
However, Mr Galloway's supporters say he will comfortably win the
other two constituency nominations when the Anderston/City branch meets
on Monday and Scotstoun/Broomhill meets the following evening.
If the MP gains two-thirds support by winning these two branches, the
executive committee and general committee have the power to order him to
be selected unopposed.

FRESH attempts are to be made to remove John Lloyd, the man who has
admitted planting bombs on ''symbolic targets'' in South Africa 30 years
ago, as Labour's candidate for the Tory-held marginal seat of Exeter, it
emerged last night.
Mr Lloyd, an anti-apartheid activist, also has admitted that after
being tortured by the South African authorities he gave evidence against
a fellow campaigner John Harris.
Harris was subsequently hanged for planting a bomb in Johannesburg
railway station, killing one person.
Mr Lloyd, 54, who has been a councillor in Exeter since 1981 and who
fought the seat unsuccessfully at the last General Election, continues
to claim that he has always been open about his past.
Now, Tribune, the left-wing weekly newspaper, is publishing an article
by Ray Eisenstein, who has himself served a prison sentence in South
Africa for anti-apartheid activities, saying that Mr Lloyd could have
saved Harris by retracting his evidence.
Mr Eisenstein writes: ''The Lloyd case is no longer a battle between
stray South Africans, dating back longer than most can remember.
''It is now a matter of British politics about the integrity of our
potential politicians.
''It is up to the Labour Party to make its decisions. How New Labour
handles this issue will give an early indication of its moral fibre as a
government.''
Tribune says that new pressure is being put on Labour's general
secretary, Tom Sawyer, urging the leadership to scrutinise the case
again.
Meanwhile, Dr Brian Mawhinney, the Tory chairman, already has called
on Labour leader Tony Blair to disown Mr Lloyd as a candidate.
The party leadership has made clear that it will ignore Dr Mawhinney's
demand.
Mr Lloyd was unavailable for comment last night.
* At the last General Election, Mr Lloyd came second to the Tories who
held the seat with a majority of 3045.

A SHINTY referee yesterday told how a player he had sent off struck
him on the face with a shinty stick.
The 47-year-old referee, Mr Donald MacFadyen, claimed Lovat team
skipper Roddy Munro thrust the sharp-pointed caman at him.
Mr MacFadyen, of Holm Park, Inverness was giving evidence in the first
day of Munro's trial at Inverness Sheriff Court.
Mr Munro, of Glendoe Terrace, Inverness, denies charges of assault and
breach of the peace at Balgate Shinty Pitch, Beauly, on February 18 this
year.
Mr MacFadyen told Sheriff James Fraser he was the official at the
Lovat versus Fort William match. Fort William were 6-0 in the lead with
20 minutes to go when Mr MacFadyen penalised Mr Munro for taking an
illegal shy. He told the court that Mr Munro disputed the decision and
then swore at him.
Mr MacFadyen said: ''According to the rules of the game, he had to be
sent off for using foul and abusive language.
''I was waiting for him to leave the field so I could restart the
game, when he turned round to face me. Then he walked towards me and was
two or three metres short of me when he raised the club with the point
facing up.
''He then lunged at my face and said, 'Take that, you bastard.' I
moved my head backwards but he followed through and caught me above the
lip.'' he told the court.
Mr MacFadyen admitted there had been friction between himself and Mr
Munro prior to and during the match.
Defence agent Bob Forrest suggested that the referee had made a wrong
decision and that his client had protested by saying: ''You are a bloody
clown.''
Mr Forrest then suggested that Mr Munro had pointed his stick at a
player who the match official had earlier not punished with a red card.
Mr Forrest asked if it were not the case that Mr MacFadyen feigned
injury to ''make life difficult for Mr Munro''.
Mr MacFadyen reacted angrily, saying: ''That is absurd.''
Trial continues on November 14.

A 56-YEAR-old Edin-
burgh man yesterday admitted carrying out sexual assaults on teenage
foreign tourists visiting the city.
Kevin Drumgoole met the young men, offered them a place to stay, and
plied them with drink.
He videoed himself carrying out sex acts on the teenagers, who
appeared oblivious to what was going on.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court, Drumgoole, of Milton Street, admitted
seven charges involving sexual assaults on youths.
Six involved named teenagers between 14 and 17. The seventh charge
covered a further 20 incidents involving unknown youths captured on
video.
The charges covered more than three years between June 1991 and August
1994.
Sheriff Richard Scott deferred sentence until November 22 for a
background report and psychiatric report. He told Drumgoole, who has a
previous conviction for a sex offence, that the offences were
''serious'' but released him on bail.
Depute-fiscal Neil Allan described Drumgoole as ''predatory'', preying
on the young and inexperienced.
He said that in five of the charges, when the victims were traced to
Germany and Holland and interviewed, they were unaware of what had
happened to them.
One said Drumgoole was his friend and he did not want to get him in
trouble. He was shown a video and changed his mind.
Mr Allan said Drumgoole usually met youngsters at Waverley railway
station and told them he had rich and famous friends.
Mr Allan said medical experts who viewed the tapes said the boys' lack
of reaction was consistent with their being intoxicated.
Defence counsel Robert Henderson QC said Drumgoole attended
psychiatric treatment three days a week and had been receiving treatment
for the past 14 years.

A YOUNG mother yesterday relived the horror of a fire which claimed
the lives of her six-month-old daughter, her friend, and her friend's
two children.
Ms Sharon Reid, 20, told a fatal accident inquiry she had been staying
at Ms Elizabeth McPhillips's house in Annan, Dumfriesshire, in February
this year when she was woken by her own son, Stefan.
Ms Reid found that part of the living room of the house, at Shawhill
Court, was ablaze. A chair and clothes, which had been drying on the
fireguard in front of the gas fire, were burning.
She shouted upstairs to Ms McPhillips, then went out with Stefan to
raise the alarm and came back in seconds with a neighbour.
Ms Reid told the inquiry she tried to get back into the blazing house
but was beaten back by flames and pulled back by the neighbour, Mr Jason
Fairbairn, as the fire and dense smoke engulfed the building.
Ms Reid and Stefan, of Springbells Road, Annan, were the only
survivors of the fire which destroyed the house and claimed the lives of
Ms Reid's daughter, Sophie, Ms McPhillips, 17, and Ms McPhillips's
children, John, nine months, and 21-month-old Sarah.
Ms Reid told the inquiry, before Sheriff Kenneth Barr at Dumfries,
that she had been staying at the house after Ms McPhillips had been
having trouble with her former boyfriend, the father of her children.
She had talked in the living room until about 2am with Ms McPhillips.
Sophie, Stefan, and John McPhillips were also in the room, and Sarah was
upstairs.
She was woken between 5am and 6am by Stefan, and fed him, and they
went back to sleep. During this time, she had spoken to Ms McPhillips,
who had gone upstairs to get more clothes to dry.
She discovered the fire when she was woken later by Stefan. Ms Reid
said she fetched Mr Fairbairn but they got only about half way down the
hall.
''The flames were shooting out of the living room door into the hall.
They were blowing out the door and I tried to get into the living room
but Jason pulled me back. Sophie was still in there. My hair was
singed.''
Ms Reid said she could hear Ms McPhillips shouting from the room next
to the bathroom.
Mr Fairbairn, 21, a dairyman, said that, at about 10am, he heard a
loud bang from next door. There was knock at the door and Sharon Reid
told his mother the house next door was on fire.
''I saw smoke coming out of the guttering and we entered the hallway,
which was smoky, and there was smoke coming down the stairs.
''I got to the living-room door, when there was an explosion. There
was a bang, a popping bang, and I believed it was the windows.
''Then there was a gust of flames and smoke . . . I was hit full in
the face. It put me on my back. Sharon was behind me and there was no
way we could get any further.
Mr Fairbairn said that, along with Mr Mark Bremner, of Hillview
Crescent, Annan, he tried to get into the house but they could not.
During evidence by fire investigation officer Stuart Irving, of
Dumfries and Galloway Fire Brigade, most of the family and relatives
left the inquiry while a video of the scene was shown and explanations
given.
Station Officer Irving said the cause of the fire in the investigation
report indicated that children's clothing on the nursery fireguard had
ignited and spread to a chair.
At first, they thought there had been no carpets. However, it had been
revealed that there was carpet in the living room where Sophie and John
died and in the upstairs bedroom where the other two victims were found.
Inquiries revealed that a cheap Belgian carpet made from polypropylene
with foam backing had been laid in the two rooms where the victims were.
''It burns like a candle, produces molten material but then burns.''
The inquiry continues today.

THE creator of Rab C Nesbitt, Ian Pattison, and Colin Gilbert, the
long-serving head of the Comedy Unit at Queen Margaret Drive, are
leaving BBC Scotland, it was confirmed yesterday.
They intend to set up their own Glasgow-based independent production
company. The move, which has been the subject of speculation for some
time, is completely amicable and will not affect BBC Scotland's
programmes.
Filming of a new series of Rab C Nesbitt, starring Gregor Fisher, was
completed within the last few weeks and it will be broadcast across the
network early next year. If a further series is commissioned, it will
almost certainly be made by the new independent for BBC Scotland.
It is understood that Mr Gilbert, who has been responsible for all of
BBC Scotland's comedy output over recent years, has secured a deal to
make a new series of The Baldy Man, again starring Fisher, for the ITV
network. This is part of the reason he has decided to sever his ties
with BBC Scotland. To remain would have caused a conflict of interests.
Meanwhile, a new network comedy series created and written by Mr
Pattison for BBC Scotland, The Bad Boys, is currently filming in the
West of Scotland. It will not be affected by the move. Nor will plans to
make a series of the writer's most recent one-off sitcom, Atletico
Partick.

THE future of the historic Prestonfield House Hotel in Edinburgh is in
doubt unless the owners can build a 25-bedroom extension, the district
development control committee was told yesterday.
Prestonfield House Hotel Ltd says the hotel, which has only five
bedrooms, breaks even because of weddings and other functions. Unless it
can increase bedroom space, the future of the hotel is in doubt.
Prestonfield House dates from 1687 and was built as a country house
for Sir James Dick, Lord Provost of Edinburgh. It is Category A listed.
The interior has several rooms of outstanding architectural quality
and, coupled with its original contents, including paintings and
furniture, it is regarded as being of outstanding architectural and
historical importance, not only to Edinburgh but to Scotland.
The committee was told that discussions had been going on between the
owners, architects, district planning officials, and Historic Scotland
since 1992. Several plans, including a separate building sunk into the
garden, had been considered.
The Cockburn Association and Scottish Civic Trust were both concerned
that the proposed extension was ''too bulky and massive''. The Royal
Fine Art Commission for Scotland described the plans as ''disastrously
wrong''.
The committee agreed to continue the matter to allow for a visit to
Prestonfield with a view to finding a formula that would allow the hotel
to continue in business and protect the character of the building.

THE perils of getting a new driveway are highlighted in the latest
edition of the consumer magazine, Which?
It says today that many companies offering to lay drives are guilty of
sharp or illegal practice. The Boys from the Blackstuff are alive and
well, concludes the magazine.
The Consumers' Association, asked three people to get price quotations
for various types of materials. The quotes showed variations of
thousands of pounds.
Which? says the worst cons include:
* Tricksters who claim to have a ''left-over load'' going cheap;
* Hard-sells which last two hours;
* Companies giving very high quotes, then big ''discounts'';
* Firms demanding payment before the work begins;
* Warranties which are not backed by insurance.
Mr Paul Kitchen, Which? senior editor, said: ''These are shabby
tactics. There are some cowboy operators who are just walking up to
people's doors and conning vast amounts of money out of them.''
Which? urges consumers to get at least three written quotes from
established firms, preferably from those recommended by satisfied
customers, and check their credentials.
Meanwhile, the magazine also analysed the cost of overdrafts to users
of the main banks and building societies.
The Bank of Scotland is highly rated for customers who occasionally
have a small overdraft, or overdraw without authorisation, while the
Royal Bank gains merit marks for those with a small overdraft, and for
its gold account.

ON November 16 if the House of Commons approves, Sir Gordon Downey,
aged 67, will take up his appointment as the first Parliamentary
Commissioner for Standards at an annual salary of #72,000 for four
working days a week.
He will be responsible for maintaining the Register of Members'
Interests and monitoring the operation of the new Code of Conduct. He
will be paid more than double the salaries of the Members of Parliament
over whom he will keep a careful eye.
This is like paying the company night watchman twice as much as the
sales director. It emphasises the extraordinary fix that MPs have got
themselves into following the sleaze allegations of recent months and
the setting up the well-intentioned but sometimes misguided Nolan
Committee.
Of course, we want to be held in higher regard by the public. Most of
us believe strongly that the reputation of Parliament, as the highest
court in the land, should be in better order.
It is ironic that our postbags have never been fuller, our attempts to
solve the daily problems of constituents never so numerous or so complex
at the same time as a recent Gallup survey showed that ''64% of the
public thought that most MPs make a lot of money by using public office
improperly''.
I doubt very much that this problem, and serious problem it is
perceived to be, will be solved by ''requiring agreements and
remuneration relating to parliamentary service'' to be publicly
disclosed as Nolan and the Labour and Liberal parties want.
Of course, what we MPs receive from the public purse is public
knowledge and our salaries from January 1 will go up from #33,189 to
#34,085. But, beyond that, a number have contracts entered into with
private employers as consultants.
These have been registered with the Registrar of Members' Interests
according to the present rules. It would be wrong for the rules to be
changed retrospectively in regard to existing contracts. If there is to
be change, it should begin at the start of a new Parliament.
But the much more fundamental question is why there should be special
rules for MPs' sources of private income (as opposed to public money)
which do not apply to anyone else in the land. Some have said to me that
disclosure will help MPs to regain the trust and confidence of their
electorate.
On the contrary. Disclosure of MPs' outside earnings will, I believe,
simply lead to jealousy and divisions. Why is X getting #10,000 for his
consultancy when Y gets #20,000? Does it mean that Y is twice as
competent, or that he only spends half as much time on his constituency
business as compared to X? The bitter questions will be endless and the
voyeurs will crawl forever over the detail.
This is not the right way to proceed if, at the heart of the issue, is
the question of the public's trust in their parliamentary
representatives.
We do not want a House of full-time politicians. Six hundred and fifty
professional robots, all spending hours in planning their next
parliamentary intervention, would mean a growing lack of knowledge of
the outside world.
In my view, Parliament must decide that, after the next election,
professional earnings from sources not connected with Parliament -- as
lawyers, doctors, directors, or journalists -- will continue, but
consultancies will be banned and parliamentary salaries will at least be
increased to the level of the new Parliamentary Commissioner.
Ministerial salaries will increase proportionately so that Ministers
will earn more than #100,000 a year and the Prime Minister at least
#200,000. There can be no justification for the Prime Minister earning
less than half the salary of the chief executive of any medium sized
British company or the editor of any major newspaper.
Now, the world may say that the politicians should not enter the
Commons to make money. True enough. But it is also correct to add that
there is no security of employment for an MP. You can be out on your ear
after five years' hard service.
It is a foolish nation that does not think it worthwhile removing
some, not all, of the financial pressures on its parliamentary
representatives.
In the 21 years I have been an MP, we have never grasped the nettle of
increasing our salaries to a level anywhere near those available in
other professions. We have become too frightened of the bad publicity.
I am leaving the House at the next election, so I can say without
self-interest how strongly I feel this must be rectified for the future.
My profound wish is for MPs to re-establish their reputation in the
community. Telling the world about our private incomes is not the
solution. Paying the rate for the job is the right way.

TWO black waitresses failed in a racial discrimination claim yesterday
after alleging that comedian Bernard Manning made them the butt of
racist jokes during a performance at the hotel where they worked.
Miss Freda Burton, 24, and Miss Sonia Rhule, 31, told an industrial
tribunal in Nottingham that 500 men at a Round Table dinner cheered as
Manning made sexist and racist jokes about them. Guests at one table
continued the abuse and insults after the performance at the Pennine
Hotel, Derby, last November.
Tribunal chairman David Sneath said the hotel could have done more to
stop the pair being exposed to the racist jokes but did not find it
responsible for discrimination.
After the hearing, Miss Burton said she was disgusted with the
decision: ''It is a white society at the end of the day. What chance do
we stand? Bernard Manning will just do it again. He will love the
publicity. But I am proud of what I have done.''
The pair said they had not received an apology from Mr Manning or
Derby Round Table.
Miss Rhule, now studying English at Derby University, said: ''What
happened was wrong and I hope this has not been nice for Bernard
Manning.
''Even hooligans have better manners than those people at the hotel
that night. I have not really lost. At least we stood up for ourselves.
I am proud of that.''
Mr David Edwards, who represented the hotel, later said that staff had
sympathy with the women for the abuse they had suffered but were happy
with the decision.

A RECORD 2.87 million tourists poured into Britain in August -- the
highest figure for any month -- it was announced yesterday.
Buoyed by record temperatures, the overall increase means 1995 could
be a record year for foreign visitors.
The Scottish Tourist Board also disclosed that overseas visitors spent
14% more last year when compared to 1993 -- a rise fuelled by campaigns
in France, Germany, and the US.
Across the UK, August visitors spent #1460m -- a record for the month
-- compared with #1430m in August 1994, according to figures from the
Central Statistical Office.
The August influx means that more than 15.72 million overseas tourists
visited Britain in the first eight months of the year -- 11% more than
in the same period last year.
The figures mean the record annual total of 21 million set last year
should be comfortably overtaken.
Foreign tourists have spent #7520m so far this year -- 12% more than
in the January-August period last year.
National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley said: ''These figures
are hard evidence of our success in attracting visitors and the boost to
the economy and potential for more jobs which tourism can bring.''
The Minister also confirmed she would address the CBI conference on
November 14 when it will debate the tourist trade for the first time.

THE MAN who dismissed a plethora of presenters at Scotland's newest
radio station was out of the door himself yesterday.
Scot FM announced that its managing director Tom Hunter had resigned
''for personal reasons'' but the alacrity of his departure suggests
deeper disagreements with its new owner Grampian Television.
The Herald understands his leaving was prompted by a meeting in
Aberdeen on Tuesday between Mr Hunter and Scot FM chairman Donald
Waters, also chief executive of Grampian TV.
In a brief statement, Mr Waters said: ''We are grateful to Tom for all
his hard work in establishing Scot FM. We wish him all the very best in
his future career.''
The station was launched in September last year with Mr Hunter at the
helm of operations. He hired many personalities, including Margo
MacDonald, Kaye Adams, Donnie Munro, Bruce Findlay, and most recently
Alison Craig.
They and others all left soon after their appointments. Although Mr
Hunter exuded considerable charm, there were many who objected to his
managerial style and the manner in which he sacked people. This prompted
some letters to the Scot FM board.
The arrival of the controversial disc jockey Scottie McClue helped
boost weekly listening figures to 350,000 in May this year and were
praised by chairman Sir David Steel.
However, Sir David was replaced by Mr Waters soon afterwards after
Grampian acquired the 35% stake in Scot FM.
Heavy start-up costs at the radio station cast a shadow over
Grampian's annual profits and there were further ructions in the
North-east when Scot FM won the commercial radio franchise for live
reports from Scottish matches. Unfortunately, its broadcast area does
not extend to the North-east and its rival NorthSound is a sponsor of
Aberdeen FC.
Grampian's director of television, Mr Bob Christie, was brought in
yesterday to act as temporary replacement, pending the appointment of a
new managing director.
Mr Richard Findlay, managing director of Radio Forth, one of the main
rivals to Scot FM, said yesterday: ''Despite all the difficulties with
the station, we always had a good personal relationship. Tom is a
talented man and I am sure he will get another job.''
Mr Hunter was not available for comment yesterday at his rented home
at Sandport, Leith, nor at the executive flat nearby which he had
recently purchased.

THE General Medical Council heard angry denials yesterday from a
psychiatrist that he had revealed confidential information about a
patient's multiple problems -- including compulsive blood-letting -- to
colleagues for use in a research paper.
Mr Alastair Palin, a consultant at Royal Cornhill Hospital, Aberdeen,
told the council's professional conduct committee that it had been
implied that he was in the habit of ''going behind patients' backs''.
He had been accused of providing detailed information about
pre-registration doctor Ms C to another consultant, Dr John Eagles, and
registrar Jon Parkin, knowing that they were going to use it in a paper
on Blood-letting in Bulimia Nervosa.
Reports had also claimed that he provided this information,
subsequently published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, without
obtaining 26-year-old Ms C's informed consent.
Dr Palin told the committee: ''A lot of my patients will be worried
that I may have gone behind their backs. It did not happen then and it
does not happen now.''
The doctor said he believed he had received informed consent from Ms
C, now 30, in the presence of her key worker Mrs Sally Hill, for her to
be interviewed by Dr Parkin.
Dr Palin's version of events was backed by Mrs Hill. She said she and
the doctor had spoken to Ms C about the article on problems such as
bulimia and blood-letting and that she had agreed to be interviewed by
Dr Parkin.
Cross examined by Miss Rosalind Foster, counsel for Ms C, Mrs Hill
agreed that the patient had ''multiple and serious problems'' although
she did not know that the blood-letting had started only when she was
admitted to Cornhill.
Mrs Hill agreed it was important for informed consent to be obtained
from a patient -- yet there was no word of Ms C's consent in her medical
notes.
Dr Palin, whose address was given as Royal Cornhill Hospital, denies
providing the other two doctors with information about Ms C for a paper
for publication in the Journal without obtaining her informed consent.
He also denies that the information he provided enabled Ms C to be
identified.
Dr Eagles, of Binghill Park, Milltimber, Aberdeen, and Dr Parkin, now
of Noel Road, Islington, north London, deny disclosing information about
Ms C without obtaining her informed consent and providing information in
the paper enabling her to be identified.
Ms A and Ms B, the other women referred to in the paper, were Dr
Eagles's patients and he had been told by Dr Palin that Ms C had similar
problems.
They agreed that Ms C should be asked if she would be willing to be
interviewed and had agreed.
Miss Foster, in summing up the case against the doctors, said all of
them were to blame, in different ways, for the article which had caused
Ms C such distress.
The hearing continues tomorrow.

GLASGOW artist Helen McLean yesterday urged the Glasgow Royal Concert
Hall to explain why her 125ft mural had been dumped under the stage
after she had been led to believe there was no money to put it on
permanent display.
Miss McLean was supported by senior Tory Councillor John Young, who
said the director, Mr Cameron McNicol, should say why Miss McLean's work
had been treated in such a manner.
Their call followed a disclosure in The Herald that an aluminium
framework for Miss McLean's work had been erected in the concert hall
while holes had been drilled to take four other frameworks.
This flies in the face of what Miss McLean had been led to believe.
She said: ''I was told by Mr McNicol that they could not afford to hang
the mural because their publicity budget had been cut. Yet it appears
that everything was there to hang them.''
It also emerged that the cost of dumping the mural under the stage is
nearer #18,000 and not #7000 as first believed.
The Herald understands that aluminium frames alone cost nearly #3000.
They too have been dumped under the stage.
Last night, Mr Young, leader of the Tory opposition on the new City of
Glasgow authority, said he sensed something dubious in the art world.
''It it interesting that they appear to have spent all this money yet
it would seem that their budget won't go any further. Surely a joinery
firm would have put them up free of charge. Mr McNicol should come clean
and explain himself.
''Where murals are concerned, things seem to go wrong at the concert
hall.''
Miss McLean, 30, who studied fine art at Lancaster University, is the
third artist has been hit by the murals jinx. She said: ''I want the
concert hall to lift the curtain and reveal the real story. My mural was
meant to go on public show, not to be hidden under some stage.''
The Herald revealed last week that her 120ft-by-8ft mural,
commissioned in October 1993 on the theme of transport, had been dumped
below the stage after being in a cloakroom for 20 months.
She did the work in consultation with Mr McNicol.
Last night, a concert hall spokesman denied Miss McLean had been
promised the mural would go on permanent display.
He said the true cost of the mural was #10,000.
He added: ''The plan is to put Miss McLean's mural up on March 1 next
year and provisionally it will be up until the end of August.''
Five years ago, Lenzie artist Ian McCulloch's murals were removed on
the orders of Councillor Pat Lally. Three weeks ago, Peter Howson
contributed a mural, only to discover it was the wrong configuration for
the alloted 10ft-by-8ft vertical space.

THE family of murder victim Thomas Currie, found dead last week in
Musselburgh yesterday made a plea for help in tracking down those
responsible for his violent death.
The body of the dead man, who it is believed suffered head injuries
was found in the Long Close between Hercus Loan and Market Street.
Mr William Currie said that although his 54-year-old brother, an Elvis
Presley fan and lookalike, could at times be a pest he knew of no-one
who would have wished to harm him.
Detective Chief Inspector Roger Orr, heading the investigation, said:
''Musselburgh has a reputation as being the Honest Toun. All I would ask
is that those responsible for maintaining that reputation come forward
and give us the assistance we need to help crack this murder.''
Mr Orr said the unemployed man was seen on at least two separate
occasions at a bus stop outside Skippers public house in the company of
two male teenagers, one wearing a distinctive back to front baseball
cap.
He was later seen around 12.15am in nearby South Street, again with
two males, both described as being in their early 20s and wearing
baseball caps.
Mr Orr, who said there was no clear motive at this stage, said there
was an hour when his movements were unaccounted for.

THE largest Highland estate on the open market has been sold for #3m
to an heiress of the giant Swedish packaging firm Tetra Pak.
Corrour Estate, extending to 48,210 acres, has been bought by Lisbet
Koerner, whose family founded the multi-million pound company, and her
husband Joseph. They will be absentee landlords.
In July, The Herald revealed increasing Scandinavian interest in
owning a piece of Scotland -- and that Far Eastern interest also was
soaring.
Last week, Glenavon -- a 41,000-acre estate in the Cairngorms --
changed hands for #6.1m in a private sale by a member of the Wills
tobacco family to a Malaysian businessman. He is also an absentee laird.
Corrour, one of the most remote and unspoilt areas of Inverness-shire,
about 30 miles from Fort William, was sold by Pollok and Corrour Ltd, a
private company offshoot of the Maxwell dynasty which has held control
of Glasgow's Pollok estate for more than 700 years.
It is accessible only by the West Highland rail line, which runs
through Corrour station, or by a 12-mile hike over rough paths.
The sale of yet another tranche of Scotland again has raised concerns
over land ownership and tenure.
SNP land spokesman Rob Gibson said it showed ''how wide open Scotland
is to being bought over by anyone from anywhere''. He said it was
ironical that Sweden was counted among the many countries which insisted
upon resident qualifications before holiday homes, let alone land, could
be purchased.
Nationalist MP Roseanna Cunningham, who is raising the political
profile of land issues, said of the Corrour and Glenavon sales: ''The
issue is not where the buyers come from but where they live in relation
to the land they own.
''Many buyers rarely live or work within the communities that they can
have such a big impact upon. It may be that nothing will change but it
must be of concern that large areas can be used by absentee landlords as
occasional holiday destinations.''
The selling agents for Corrour stressed that all estate workers would
be re-employed by the new owners, both professors who lecture at Harvard
University in the US.
It is understood the couple plan to make a visit with their two young
children next spring.
Herald inquiries suggest that Scandinavians own well over 150,000
acres in Scotland, with the figure growing all the time.
They include the Aage V Jensens Fonde, Denmark's largest environmental
and forestry foundation; the Danish Lego corporation family, and even
the Swedish Government, which owns an estate in Argyll.

AFTER a marathon round of sometimes acrimonious negotiations the
Select Committee on Standards in Public Life has published its
recommendations for tightening up the rules governing the behaviour of
MPs.
The Government claims the changes, if agreed in the Commons on Monday,
will mark the most substantial reassessment of parliamentary standards
since the war.
Like the court of the ageing Louis XVI, the latter years of this
Conservative Government have been dogged by a sense of unstoppable
decay. The headline writers dubbed it sleaze, and an unhappy string of
Tory MPs -- at least 17 to date -- duly provided the evidence, paying by
resignation for behaviour which the media and public opinion have judged
unworthy of an elected parliamentarian.
Monday's debate has its genesis in the aftermath of the 1992 David
Mellor affair, when the then Cabinet Minister was forced to resign
following revelations of an affair and claims that he violated rules
governing ministerial conduct by accepting a free holiday from the
daughter of a PLO official. The persistence with which he clung to
office, culminating in the ignominy of his ''from toe job to no job''
departure, was taken as proof of an unhealthy laxness in political
standards.
The following year, at the party conference, John Major announced he
would lead the Tories Back to Basics, and reinforce their image as the
party of morality and probity. The policy proved to be a disaster from
the start.
Like a provoked bull, the media produced revelation after scandalous
revelation, of Ministers producing illegitimate children, of
parliamentary private secretaries participating in suspicious housing
deals, and of Tory MPs accepting cash for asking parliamentary
questions.
In October last year, under intense pressure, Mr Major announced the
formation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life under Lord Nolan.
Its terms of reference include ''to examine current concerns about
standards of conduct of all holders of public office''. The outside
income of peers and MPs, cash-for-questions, and the role of lobbyists
were among the first issues to be examined.
Last May the committee published its first report, which included its
own list of the Seven Principles of Public Life: selflessness,
integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty, and
leadership. It also recommended that MPs be banned from using Parliament
to represent outside bodies, and that they disclose fully outside
contracts and remuneration.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats welcomed Lord Nolan's
recommendations, and called for their full implementation. Tory MPs,
however, were divided. Many questioned the effect of full disclosure,
claiming it would hit Tories worse than Labour because more Tories had
outside commercial interests.
When the report was debated in the Commons in May, the Government
announced that it would accept most of the recommendations, but came
under fire from back benchers on disclosure. The Prime Minister was
faced with demands to reject part of the work of a committee he
appointed to restore public faith in the political system.
He finessed his response by accepting Lord Nolan's findings as a
whole, but left it up to the Commons to decide how to respond to the
recommendations concerning parliamentary procedure and the conduct of
MPs.
The 11-member Select Committee on Standards in Public Life was duly
appointed, with a Tory majority, and chaired by Leader of the House Tony
Newton.
The committee's first report recommended the appointment of a
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to monitor MPs' behaviour, the
creation of a new committee on standards and privileges to replace the
existing Select Committee on Privileges, and a new code of conduct for
MPs. But a decision on the question of disclosure was deferred until
yesterday.
When this was debated in July, the Government rejected Labour demands
for immediate action on disclosure.
Following Parliament's return in mid-October, the committee's final
sessions were perturbed by rumours that chairman Tony Newton was caving
in to pressure from the Cabinet and back benchers to reject Nolan's call
for full disclosure. He was also criticised for accepting demands from
some Tories that implementation of the changes be postponed until after
the next election.
Yesterday's final report shows he had his way on keeping the amount
MPs earn hidden. In some cases it reaches hundreds of thousands of
pounds.
Last night Mr Newton argued that the ban on advocacy, which prohibits
MPs from using Parliament to further the cause of their paid outside
interests, was a far tougher measure than that proposed by Nolan.
MPs will no longer be allowed to table questions, or motions, or
initiate debates on behalf of whatever special interest they might
represent.
They would, however, be able to participate in a debate concerning
their clients, but only after declaring an interest.
The Government's failure to seize the nettle and accept the need for
an MP's outside earnings to be fully transparent has angered a small but
possibly influential group of Tory MPs, who may now vote with Labour and
defeat the Government when the report is debated on Monday.
They argue that Parliament's standing could be severely damaged if it
fails to reform itself.

A MAJOR security inquiry is expected to be launched at 10 Downing
Street after two men are reported to have gained entry and taken
photographs.
A newspaper report claims that the anti-terrorist net around the Prime
Minister was broken during yesterday's incident.
One of the men had been working inside Number 10 during rewiring and
redecorating work through the summer, the Sun newspaper reported.
He should have handed in his ID pass but kept it for several days. He
was a familiar face to police guards on duty outside.
When he returned, he was accompanied by a friend with a camera and
after they got in, he took photos of the rooms, the paper claimed.
Police chiefs are reported to have denounced the stunt.
Security at Downing Street was tightened six years ago at the height
of an IRA terror campaign.
The Prime Minister now has police protection and high-tech security.
In another recent report, a Daily Mirror journalist described how he
spent 48 minutes stalking the Treasury, Cabinet Offices, and Number 10
Downing Street.
The reporter said no-one demanded any identification at any time and
no-one checked if he had any kind of permission to be there.
He was able to take photographs outside the door of the Prime
Minister's private quarters at Downing Street.
''I posed for a snap outside the Treasury office of Cabinet Minister
William Waldegrave,'' said the Mirror reporter.
''I even managed to have a look around one of No 10's junk rooms
where, if I'd wanted, I could quite easily have left a bomb.
''I wasn't searched, quizzed or screened. If I was a terrorist, I
would have thought I'd died and gone to heaven.''
A Downing Street spokesman said: ''We are satisfied that the Prime
Minister's security is satisfactory.
''Any evidence of an alleged breach in security should be give to us
to investigate.
''Any breach found to have taken place will be immediately
investigated and any necessary action taken.''

SUTHERLAND Estates yesterday withdrew its application to increase
rents for crofters -- in some cases said to be by nearly 1000% -- after
the intervention of the Countess of Sutherland whose family were
prominent in the Highland Clearances.
The case for the rent rises, the first in 11 years, was presented to a
hearing of the Scottish Land Court in Tongue earlier this week by estate
factor Mr Christopher Whealing. He had based the increases on
calculations of the number of sheep each croft could sustain and their
value based on local lamb sale prices.
This had resulted in a proposed rent of #5 for each sheep that a croft
could hold and in one case this meant a rise from #61.41 to #1435.
The increases had affected crofters at Borgie, Skerray, and Tongue.
Mr Wheeling said yesterday: ''I have just heard from Lady Sutherland
and she has decided that we should withdraw our application to the land
court for rent increases in light of the strength of feeling against the
increases and method of valuation.
''We will now withdraw, if the court has no objection, and we have no
plans at present to go with another application. Lady Sutherland did not
want to have rent increases that the crofters could not afford to pay.''
Mrs Betty MacKenzie, grazings clerk at Skerray, said: ''This is great
news. We are absolutely delighted, but the matter will not rest here.
They will be back for another rent increase but we won't be caught in
the same way. When this proposal came out, we were caught totally
unawares.''
Ms Pat Rodin, area president of the Scottish Crofters Union, also
expressed delight. ''We had been determined to fight this. We had
expected increases of 200%, perhaps 300%, because of the 11 years since
the last review, but were totally gobsmacked by what was proposed. The
proposal seemed to have been based on prices at an unusually good sale
at Lairg -- but we send to Forsinard.''
The land court, which had heard from Mr Whealing that the increases
were needed to cover factoring costs on the 20,000-acre Tongue Estate,
had been adjourned for three months to allow the crofters to take legal
advice.
The court would then have inspected the crofts and given its ruling
six to eight weeks later. That now appears unnecessary because of the
Countess's action.
Meanwhile, in Dornoch, the divisional planning office is still taking
objections to a planning application lodged last month to remove the
statue on Ben Bhraggie of Lady Sutherland's notorious forbear the first
Duke of Sutherland. It would be replaced by a large Celtic cross.
* The new Highland Council is to take the lead in tackling issues of
land reform and control in the Highlands and will try and conduct the
fullest review of human and environmental needs since the Crofting
Review in the 1950s or the Napier Commission over 100 years ago.
Dr Michael Foxley, newly elected chairman of the council's land and
environment committee, said yesterday that councillors had been
encouraged by Scots Secretary Michael Forsyth's recent proposals to
transfer the control of Scottish Office owned croftland to local
crofting trusts, and his call to private landlords to follow his
example. His new committee would pursue these matters with him.
The new council had unanimously adopted a policy statement which
committed it to supporting and helping change the pattern of Highland
land and seabed ownership toward a more local, egalitarian system.

UNDERCOVER drugs squad officers will be allowed to give evidence from
behind screens and use false names to protect their own lives and the
lives of their families a judge ruled yesterday.
The unprecedented security measures were agreed after the judge heard
that organised criminals in London have set up a database to collate
information about police officers working undercover.
The two drugs-squad men are due to give evidence at a trial involving
four accused at the High Court in Glasgow.
Lord Sutherland was told at the High Court in Edinburgh that two of
the witnesses on the indictment are serving police officers using the
false names of Vittorio Salesi and Martin Clark for undercover
operations connected with the forthcoming trial.
Both officers are still engaged on other covert police operations
using assumed names and the Crown claims that if their true identities
are revealed, both they and their families would be in danger.
The Crown says that if the officers have to give evidence in view of
members of the public and the press, the risk will be increased.
Lord Sutherland was informed that people involved in organised crime
in England had set up a database in London in which all the information
discovered at trials about undercover police officers was collated in an
effort to discover their true identity.
Mr Iain Bonomy QC, Advocate-depute, argued that it would be in the
interests of justice for the two policemen to give their evidence
without revealing their true identity, personal details and details of
their police service, and for their evidence to be given while concealed
from the press and public by means of screens.
Miss Frances McMenamin, defence counsel for one of the accused, said
she could not object to the Crown request on the basis that there would
be any prejudice to her client but she argued that the Crown was using a
sledgehammer to crack a nut.
She argued that, in the past, the press had never abused its position
by disclosing by photographs or detailed information the names and
addresses of police officers involved in undercover drugs operations.
She said a direction from the Bench for the press to be circumspect in
its reporting of the evidence of certain witnesses would be taken on
board by the media.
Mr Dennis Crawley, counsel for another of the accused, said that his
concern about the arrangements suggested by the Crown was the impression
it would create in the minds of the jury.
It seemed to him that what the Crown wished to achieve could be done
by closing the court for a short period. The jury need not even know
that this had taken place.
Mr Bonomy stressed: ''I do have reliable evidence to indicate the
seriousness of the danger and the organised way in which the danger
would be present to these witnesses.
''That goes as far as organised criminals in London setting up a
database into which even the height and general description of witnesses
is fed with a view to their identity being used for future criminal
purposes.''
He argued that closing the court would be a more extreme measure than
what was being suggested by the Crown. The courts were open to the
public and the public and press should be allowed into court to hear the
evidence being given whether or not they could see the witness.
What was being suggested was a mechanism that interfered as little as
possible with normal courtroom procedure.
Lord Sutherland said nothing that had been put before him suggested
there would be any material prejudice to any of the accused by the
arrangements proposed by the Crown.
These steps seemed to him to be perfectly reasonable in a situation
where the police officers were acting under cover and the press and the
public would still be able to hear their evidence.
He agreed that the two police witnesses should use pseudonyms when
giving their evidence and that it should be given while they were
concealed from the press and public.
While the steps taken by the Crown in this case are believed to be
unique in a criminal case, members of the Special Air Service (SAS) were
allowed to give evidence in a civil case at the Court of Session in 1993
shielded from the public gaze by 7ft-high screens. They were referred to
in court only by their initials -- for example, soldier T.
They were giving evidence in a #30,000 damages action by a Peterhead
prisoner, John Devine, who claimed that the SAS used excessive force
when they freed prison officer Jackie Stewart in October 1987 after he
had been held hostage for six days.
A jury took 30 minutes to reject Devine's #30,000 claim.

A BRITON, who has come to the aid of a badly injured African girl, has
been told by hospital executives he cannot take her out of Gambia for a
much needed operation unless he pays #5000 to their ''charity''.
Bradford builder Mr Terry Thornton heard about the plight of
eight-year-old Sira Jarjue while on holiday in the country earlier this
year.
Sira's arms had been fused to her chest after she fell on to a fire at
her home. Mr Thornton brought her back to Britain for two operations at
St James' Hospital in Leeds.
After three months, Sira returned to Gambia, but she needs a final
operation to allow her use of her left hand.
Mr Thornton said Gambian hospital executives have told him he cannot
take Sira out of the country again unless he pays them. He claims
figures of up to #5000 have been suggested.
''I know that if we can get her over here again we can give her the
use of her hand. If we don't, it's such a waste,'' said Mr Thornton.
''The technology is here and so many people are behind me. But the
hospital in Gambia thinks I'm rolling in money and they say that only if
I give them something for their charity can Sira come back.
''They say I've been using her for my own gain but how can I have
been? I've got no money. I've spent all I had on Sira.''
Mr Thornton raised #2000 for Sira's three-month stay. He spent half on
her and gave the other half to St James' Hospital, where surgeons
operated on her in their free time.
A spokesman for the Royal Victoria Hospital in Gambia's capital,
Banjul, insisted the #2000 Mr Thornton raised should be donated to the
hospital's trust for Sira.
''We also need a very urgent letter from the doctor in the UK saying
that Sira can go back. There isn't a problem,'' he added.
The spokesman said the money would be used to pay for air fares for
Sira and a nurse, but Mr Thornton claimed the hospital has told him he
must pay the air fare -- which he is happy to do -- and donate the cash.

YES
THE only certain issue stemming from the Nolan Report in Parliament
this week is that the Government, and in particular the Whips, wish that
it had never been written. The issue is certainly a serious one for the
Conservative Party. The considerable majority of declared ''interests''
are in respect of Conservative MPs and so some fear that if the
disclosure proposal is rejected, that they will be accused of seeking to
hide what some commentators regard as dirty washing. On the other hand,
if the proposal is accepted, Conservative MPs and of course some MPs of
other parties will require to declare their outside income which could
become a vehicle to attack them with in election contests.
So it is little wonder that Conservative MPs are angry, sensitive
and,in some cases, outraged. Some have told me that it would be
embarrassing and unfair if they were obliged to declare all their income
to a public which cannot fully appreciate the relatively low level of
parliamentary salaries or the relatively high expenses involved in being
an MP.
Others have argued that the public do not fully appreciate that it is
because of the superior intelligence, knowledge, and experience of
Conservative MPs that firms, organisations, and lobbying firms prefer to
employ them rather than inadequate Labour MPs.
Feelings are running high. One Minister I met on Tuesday told me that
he was furious that the Government had already decided to appoint a
supervisor of parliamentary standards at a salary twice the level of MPs
and to select for the job a retired civil servant of 67 years of age who
had already had a high pension.
So what can reasonably be done. My belief is that the standing of
Parliament has declined so much in recent years that it would be foolish
and shortsighted to do nothing. When I was first elected to Parliament
some 31 years ago I can well remember my mother and other relatives
being thrilled that I had been elected to an institution of the highest
standing.
Last year I was quite taken aback by one of my children telling me he
would have been rather embarrassed to say that his father was a
Conservative MP.
Of course, my children may indeed be unrepresentative, but I think
that most MPs would understand the basic problem. Parliament's powers
have faded away to such an extent that Westminster is becoming largely a
focus for the expression of opinions. In addition, the establishing of
lobbying firms has created a whole new range of opportunities for
additional income for MPs.
As Nolan has stated so clearly, the primary object of MPs is to
represent their constituents and if, in addition, they decide to act as
an advocate of a special interest it is important that not only should
the interest be declared, but that the amount of salary should be
declared.
It is far from certain how democracy will be strengthened by such sums
being disclosed, but as the committee's recommendation was unanimous and
as the public appear unlikely to understand the logic of rejecting the
recommendations, my belief is that there would be merit in accepting
Nolan in principle if the alternative is a further decline in respect
for Parliament.
However, my one caveat is that any such plans must not come into
operation until the day after the next election. It would be unfair to
MPs who have taken on a position in Parliament and taken on additional
work on the basis that the details of such arrangements would not become
public if we were to insist on Nolan being implemented immediately. If
we delay the decision, MPs who do not wish to reveal can simply decide
not to stand for re-election.
If, however, we do nothing at all my fear is that many Conservative
MPs will be denied the opportunity of being re-elected.
There is the widespread view that the Conservatives have somehow
become a party of sleaze. Any problem which exists is a limited one. And
I also take the view that there are some sleazy aspects of the other
parties as well.
However, the best way to protect the majority of MPs would be to have
the cloud of secrecy lifted. If there is nothing to hide, why should it
not be disclosed.

A MAJOR security inquiry is expected to be launched at 10 Downing
Street after two men are reported to have gained entry and taken
photographs.
A newspaper report claims the anti-terrorist net around the Prime
Minister was broken during yesterday's incident.
One of the men had been working inside No 10 during rewiring and
redecorating work through the summer, the Sun newspaper reported.
He should have handed in his ID pass but kept it for several days.
When he returned, he was accompanied by a friend with a camera and
after they got in, he took photographs of the rooms, the paper claimed.
Security at Downing Street was tightened six years ago at the height
of an IRA campaign.
In another recent report, a Daily Mirror journalist described how he
spent 48 minutes stalking the Treasury, Cabinet Offices, and No 10.
The reporter said no-one demanded any identification at any time.
He was able to take photographs outside the door of the Prime
Minister's private quarters at Downing Street. ''I posed for a snap
outside the Treasury office of Cabinet Minister William Waldegrave,''
said the Mirror reporter.
He said he could easily have left a bomb. ''I wasn't searched, quizzed
or screened. If I was a terrorist, I would have thought I'd died and
gone to heaven.''
A Downing Street spokesman said: ''We are satisfied that the Prime
Minister's security is satisfactory,'' adding any breach would be
investigated.

EXCLUSIVE
HOOVER'S new owner at Cambuslang wants voluntary redundancies and
introduction of short-time working at the plant before Christmas.
Suppliers have been told that contract quotes for next year should be
frozen at 1995 levels -- although payments for deliveries could be put
back by almost three months.
Unions at Cambuslang yesterday confirmed talks with management over
the cutbacks.
The firm's Merthyr Tydfil plant has already been put on a four-day
week, blamed on a stock surplus caused by a slump in demand for white
goods.
A spokeswoman for Candy, the Italian washing-machine firm which bought
Hoover in May, said the firm was ''looking at ways to reduce a high
stock level as a result of the industry-wide reduction in demand in
Europe and elsewhere.''
However, she confirmed an unspecified number of voluntary redundancies
at Cambuslang was being sought.
The firm has also deemed it inappropriate to fund the staff lunch,
pensioners' lunch, and children's party at Cambuslang this Christmas.
Union convener Peter Brannan said talks are under way on a short-time
working week.
He said discussions had been amicable so far. However, he added that
since the takeover around 300 jobs had been shed at Cambuslang and
another 100 at Merthyr Tydfil. He stressed: ''Unions will resist
compulsory redundancies.''
Hoover lost millions of pounds when a 1991 free flights' promotion
flopped and, two years ago, the Cambuslang plant staved off closure at
the expense of a plant in France.
Candy, which bought the firm for #106m and now employs 900 at its
Scottish base, pledged to expand the business on takeover. Its
spokeswoman added: ''Since then, the economy has not taken off as
thought.''
She confirmed suppliers had been informed that the firm's starting
point for negotiations on 1996 contracts was that prices should be fixed
at 1995 levels.
It had also proposed changes to payment times for supplies. In some
cases, the proposals suggest that Candy, currently meeting bills within
45 days, will not now pay up until 120 days after delivery.
The spokeswoman said Candy wanted to start the New Year with ''a clean
sheet and it was prudent to take measures now.''

HOME Secretary Michael Howard suffered another embarrassing reverse in
the courts yesterday when a High Court judge ruled his decision to
exclude Unification Church founder, Sun Myung Moon from Britain was
unlawful.
The Home Office, however, insisted the judge's ruling did not mean the
ban on the Reverend Moon entering the country would be lifted.
Last night, it remained unclear whether the Rev Moon would be allowed
to make his planned three-day visit this weekend and give a speech to
1200 followers in London.
Mr Justice Sedley declared that Mr Howard's decision last Friday, was
''unlawful by reason of procedural unfairness''.
He allowed an application by the Rev Moon for a judicial review of the
Minister's personal decision to block his visit.
In a statement, the Home Office said: ''The judge did not quash the
Home Secretary's decision to exclude the Rev Moon from entering this
country. Consequently Rev Moon has no right to enter the UK.''
The statement continued: ''If Rev Moon wishes to make any
representations to the Home Secretary these representations will be
considered.''
It went on to suggest the judge's decision had been unexpected.
''The Home Secretary acted under the 1971 Immigration Act. It has
never been the practice to invite representations from those excluded.
This is the first occasion on which the courts have held that such
representations should be invited.''
The judge ruled that the Minister did have the power to exclude the
75-year-old Korean-born leader of the controversial ''Moonies'' from the
country on the grounds that his presence ''would not be conducive to the
public good''.
The judge said: ''I consider there was want of fairness in failing to
afford the applicant (the Rev Moon) an opportunity to know why it was
considered . . . it was contrary to the public good to let him come
here.''
Mr Howard acted after taking account of ''widespread public concern''
about the church's effect on families and the extensive publicity which
the church would receive through Rev Moon's visit.
However, the judge ruled that Mr Howard had departed from the
long-established legal duty ''to listen fairly to both sides''.
Mr Michael Beloff QC, for the Home Secretary, told the court that Mr
Howard would ''use his best endeavours'' to reconsider his decision.
Mr Howard was refused leave to appeal against the ruling but can still
apply to the Court of Appeal direct to challenge it.
The Home Office was ''considering'' the judgment last night and it was
thought that the possibility of an appeal was being looked at carefully.
After the High Court hearing, Mr David Coombs, solicitor for the Rev
Moon, said: ''We are absolutely delighted with this decision. It is yet
another chapter in the continuing saga of unreasonable and unfair
actions against the church.''
However, the judge's decision was met with disappointment by one vocal
critic of the Rev Moon.
Mr Ian Haworth, general secretary of the London-based Cult Information
Centre, an educational charity specialising in cults, said: ''I'm upset
that on a mere technicality the decision of the Home Secretary has been
deemed to be unlawful.
''The Moonies cannot claim they have won any kind of major victory.
Nothing has been said to suggest that the Home Secretary was not right
to try to ban Mr Moon.''
Sir Ivan Lawrence, chairman of the Commons home affairs select
committee, said the court's ruling was of only limited significance.
''He did not quash the Home Secretary's decision and there is no
suggestion that the Home Secretary acted beyond his powers.
''What he did is to point out that the Home Secretary should have
faxed a letter to Mr Moon telling him that he was minded to refuse his
application and to let him have any representations,'' he told BBC Radio
4's World at One programme.

A CHURCH of Scotland eventide home in Dunbar is to close.
St Andrew's Eventide Home in the East Lothian seaside town's High
Street, sits beside its impressive #1m parish church, rebuilt and
restored after it was destroyed by fire in 1987.
Hotelier Norman Hampshire, who represents Dunbar on the new East
Lothian unitary authority pledged immediate action in a bid to save the
home, which he said was ''close to the hearts of the people of Dunbar''.
''It has come as quite a shock. It is something we did not expect. We
hopefully will try and arrange a meeting as quickly as possible with
officials from the Church of Scotland to see if anything can be done to
reverse this decision. It is a well respected home in the community and
everybody will want to save it,'' he said.
Secretary of the local community council, Mrs Cathy Acton described
the move as ''very worrying''.
''There are very few homes in Dunbar for elderly people to stay within
their own community. It is very sad.''
Businessman and former regional councillor, Mr John Stephenson -- who
lives only a few yards from the building, which is home to 23 residents
-- said he was saddened by the decision.
''It fills a need in the community for people, particularly people who
are left on their own. They can be looked after to a very high standard
and still be part of the community.
''I have visited a number of times and found the staff to be very hard
working, often working against the odds, but nevertheless very
professional,'' he said.
The Church of Scotland established the home for the elderly in the
town in the early 1970s, from two converted guest houses, bought for
#14,000 in 1971.
A spokesman for the board of social responsibility said a decision had
yet to be taken over the future of the prime site building but it was
likely it would be put on the market.

POLICE have launched a massive hunt for a dangerous mental patient who
has gone on the run armed with a shotgun.
Dale Morris, 29, went missing from a hospital in Leek, Staffordshire,
on Tuesday night. Police have refused to give details of how he escaped.
Morris was being treated after being put under a hospital order by a
judge at Stoke Crown Court on October 19 for having a loaded air rifle
in a public place despite being the subject of a firearms prohibition.
Staffordshire Police said Morris should not be approached by the
public under any circumstances. They confirmed he was in possession of a
firearm and ammunition.
Police have used a helicopter and dogs in the hunt so far.
Hospital chiefs said he had been transferred from prison just four
hours earlier after showing signs of ''bizarre behaviour''.
He had been released from a three and a half year prison term for only
two months when he was arrested in June.
He had been resident at Blakenhurst Prison in Reading waiting to be
transferred to the Menzies Unit of St Edwards Hospital in Leek under a
six-month renewable court order under a section of the Mental Health
Act.
Mr David Pearson, the mental health general manager for North Staffs
NHS Trust, said Morris was due to undergo a psychiatric assessment to
determine his mental state and had been under the closest level of
visual supervision with a nurse watching him constantly.
He said: ''At first he seemed to be compliant and quite happy to be in
hospital rather than prison. At around 8.30pm he made a dash and managed
to avoid restraint by nursing staff. He left the hospital premises,
which are in a rural location, and went off into the darkness.
''I would have to point out that this is not a prison and not a locked
facility. We are not a secure unit although we do treat the full
spectrum of mental disorders from depression to psychosis.''
He is described as 5ft 6ins tall, of athletic build with short dark
curly hair and a London accent. When last seen he was wearing a black
suede bomber jacket, dark T-shirt and jeans.

A TEACHER at a Stirling primary school is to face trial accused of
assaulting three boy pupils.
Stirling Sheriff Court confirmed yesterday that lawyers for teacher
Thomas McGhee had tendered not guilty pleas in his absence to three
charges.
Mr McGhee, 40, of Buchan Drive, Dunblane, is accused of assaulting the
boys inside and outside a classroom at the school on August 23.
The charges allege that he seized an eight-year-old boy by the
clothing, pulled him out of the classroom, seized him by the face,
squeezed and lifted him by the face. He is alleged to have grabbed two
nine-year-old boys by the clothing, pulled them from the class, banged
their heads together, before pushing and slapping one of the boys and
throwing the other against a wall, striking him on the chest. The
charges allege that, as a result, one of the nine year-olds was injured.
Trial has been set down for November 15.

SCOTTISH know-how is being used to help defuse a floating ''nuclear
time-bomb'' anchored in a major city's harbour in Russia.
Yesterday, the Scot who clinched the technology transfer deal said
that European taxpayers' cash would finance a study into the
''potentially catastrophic'' condition of the ship Lepse, in the port of
Murmansk on Russia's Arctic coast.
The 61-year-old converted cargo ship is a safety hazard to the
half-a-million people in the city, because she is literally a floating
atomic dustbin.
The Lepse has two water-filled holds containing dangerous,
badly-twisted radioactive fuel rods, damaged in a nuclear ''melt-down''
accident on board the world's first atomic-powered icebreaker Lenin,
which was kept secret from the Soviet people when it happened in 1960.
The contract to devise a solution for the Lepse problem has been won
by Britain's AEA Technology, in a joint-venture with the state-owned
French nuclear company SGN.
It will make use of know-how in the remote-handling of highly
radioactive materials from Dounreay, where the soon-to-be-privatised arm
of the UK Atomic Energy Authority employs 300 out of a total of 1400
workers.
At Dounreay yesterday, Mr Neil Buchan, 38, who has just returned from
Murmansk, said that the 61-year-old ship contained other tanks holding
potentially hazardous wastes.
The engineering graduate of Aberdeen's Robert Gordon's University, who
is now AEA Technology's Scottish marketing manager and clinched the
deal, said: ''Two Dounreay engineers should complete a detailed
examination of the ship and its contents using remote viewing devices
over the next few weeks.
He added: ''The contract team intends to provide the Russians with a
firm plan within six months for decommissioning this ship and for the
safe removal of the nuclear wastes, using as much local labour as
possible. The Russians are concerned about what would happen if another
ship collided with the Lepse. She has been anchored since she was taken
out of service 14 years ago.''
Yesterday, Scottish-born Shaun Birnie, Greenpeace International's
Amsterdam-based nuclear researcher, doubted whether Dounreay and the
French partners were the right people for the task.
He said: ''Dounreay has its own potential catastrophe right on its
doorstep with its waste shaft containing an unknown cocktail of
radioactive wastes, which are too dangerous to leave alone and too
lethal to move, except at vast expense. They should be cleaning up their
own mess first, but instead they are actually proposing more radioactive
contamination by aggressively seeking international reprocessing
contracts.''
The Lepse was one of two vessels used to refuel the former Soviet
Union's six-strong fleet of automic-powered icebreakers, owned by the
Murmansk Shipping Company.
These have been described as the only successful nuclear-powered
merchant ships in the world because their submarine-style reactors
allowed them to work throughout the winter keeping key Arctic seaways
open.

THE Government was under increasing pressure last night to order a
halt to gas pipeline operations in the North Channel, as fears grow over
munitions dumped in the area.
Following the publication of photographic evidence that the problem
appears to be worse than originally admitted, a call was made in the
Commons for an emergency debate on the matter.
Despite the rejection of the debate call by the Speaker, a cross-party
group of MPs is determined to intensify the campaign for full
information to be made available.
As British Gas resisted calls for a voluntary cessation of work on the
pipeline between the Galloway and Antrim coasts, the MPs called on
Environment Secretary John Gummer to instruct a prohibition order to be
placed on the company.
The campaign, which has been running for several weeks after the
discovery of thousands of phosphorous sticks on Scottish beaches, was
stepped up yesterday after the leaking of survey footage showing
munitions and other identified objects right next to the pipeline.
A munitions expert claimed that some of the objects appeared to be
mines or depth charges and said that they would be volatile after long
immersion in sea water.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, called
for the debate yesterday and accused Ministers of passing the buck. He
said later: ''Now the evidence is overwhelming that the pipeline has
gone into an area where munitions have been dumped. British Gas keeps
trotting out this line that the objects in the area are safe. Who has
come to that momentous decision?''
He added: ''The time has now come for the buck to stop and for
Ministers in the various departments concerned to take responsibility
for what is rapidly turning into a scandal.
''First of all, we were told it was defence, then it was industry, now
we learn it is environment that has the responsibility for prohibiting
this work. I have tabled a question to John Gummer and will be seeking
an urgent meeting with him.
''In the meantime, a group of us will meet Energy Minister Tim Eggar
next week.''
Mr Jim Willison of British Gas said last night that the offshore work
on the natural gas pipeline between Scotland and Northern Ireland would
be finished in weeks and there was no intention to stop working. He
added: ''Work on the pipeline by contractors for Premier Transco is
nearing completion and the trenching work is being carried out to sink
the pipeline into the seabed.
''All the relevant permissions and licences are in placeand indeed we
were in discussions a number of weeks ago with the Ministry of Defence
and the Health and Safety Executive over the discovery of debris on the
pipeline route. This turned out, after expert appraisal, to be inert
ordnance and we were given permission to go ahead.''
He added: ''At every stage of pipe-laying operations, procedures have
been agreed with the authorities and work would not have been allowed to
continue if there was a risk to the health and safety of construction
personnel or the public.''
Mr Willison declined to comment on suggestions that the pictures used
by media organisations yesterday had come from the Premier Transco
survey and added: ''I have seen only a grainy fax of the pictures.''
Argyll and Bute MP Mrs Ray Michie said: ''There can be no doubt now
that the operations by British Gas must cease at once, until a full
independent survey can be conducted.''
Mr Brian Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, said: ''A lot of people
are being economical with the truth over this affair. The fact that this
includes Government Ministers is outrageous.''

A YOUNG Scot has been jailed for life by a court in Thailand for drug
trafficking, it emerged yesterday.
Brent Fraser Stirling, 26, from Perth, intends to appeal against the
sentence.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office is concerned about his health and are
hoping the authorities will move him to another prison. Stirling was
sentenced on Tuesday at a hearing in a provincial court in Songkhla in
southern Thailand.
He was arrested last December in a joint operation organised by Thai
police and agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration at a
shopping centre in the town of Hat Yai, close to Thailand's border with
Malaysia.
Police said at the time that Stirling had been found with 599g of
heroin and cocaine. DEA officials were said to have posed as buyers when
Stirling allegedly turned up with 400 small packages containing the
drugs.
Life sentences in Thailand usually mean a prison term of 25 years.
Stirling has until the end of this month to appeal.
He has been held on remand in a prison in Songkhla, about 600 miles
south of the Bangkok capital. British Consular officials in Thailand are
hoping he will be moved to Bangkok central jail where conditions are
better.
A Foreign Office spokesman yesterday confirmed Stirling intended to
appeal against the sentence.
He added that Stirling's parents, who had flown out to Thailand for
the trial and sentencing, would be returning home soon.
Some reports claimed Stirling had pled not guilty at his trial and
that he had said the drugs belonged to someone else who had asked him to
keep them for him. However, the Foreign Office said he had pled guilty.
It is understood that if the life sentence remains in force, Stirling
could transfer to a British jail after serving a minimum of eight years
in Thailand.

STEPHEN Fry opened his heart yesterday and explained why he walked out
of the West End play, Cell Mates. He admitted he had seriously
considered taking his own life.
Ultimately it was the thought of hurting family and friends which
pulled him back in the days when he was alone in Europe. He has since
undergone psychotherapy in the US.
The comedian and actor spoke frankly to journalists for more than half
an hour before he was reinstalled as Rector of Dundee University.
He said he was feeling much better and was now starting to work with
cameo roles in TV and film. He was also getting back to writing.
Looking slim and fit, having lost two stone and started going to the
gym, and with his once dyed blonde hair now a brown colour called
Chocolate Kiss, he said he was ready to take on the future.
However, he would not be working and pushing himself as much as in the
past.
The pressures of working non-stop in entertainment for so long had
contributed to him reaching ''crisis point'' when he got bad reviews in
Cell Mates.
It was a general feeling of complete unhappiness.
''When you get just a complete sense of blackness, a void head view
that somehow the future looks an impossible place to be, and the
direction you're going seems to have no purpose.
''There is this word despair which is a very awful thing to feel,'' he
said. Asked if he had contemplated suicide he said: ''Yes, of course, if
one is honest, yes absolutely.''
He refused to describe the crisis moment, saying it could be something
he would write about in the future.
''It seems a rather negative thing that the only reason to consider
carrying on having a pop at living is so other people don't get upset
but it is a good enough reason. One is reminded of the Dorothy Parker
line, 'you might as well live'.
''I hasten to say I do not feel that kind of black at the moment.''
He would now be continuing to live in Britain and concentrating on
writing.
Asked by reporters if he now accepted that his thoughts of suicide
were a ''gross over-reaction'', he agreed.
''Of course it is a gross over-reaction. It is a symptom of neurosis,
it is an absurd thing to do.''
He added: ''You look at your life and say it is hopeless when in fact
it is not hopeless. You've got friends, enough money to take time to do
things, far luckier than many other people. It was an absurd
over-reaction. There is no ignoring that.''
He refused to be drawn into the circumstances surrounding Cell Mates
because of legal action taken by the producer, who is suing him for
#500,000 because of the closure of the play when he left.
However, he did say he would be fighting the action because otherwise
it would financially ruin him.
He criticised the producer for taking the action:''He does not accept
medical reports which made it quite clear that I was not a well
person.''

<HEADLINE>Advertising budget is doubled months after cuts leave an alarming shortage of frontline troops. About-turn as Army recruits again</HEADLINE>

THE Army's annual advertising budget has been increased from #9m to
#17.5m, as it fights to increase recruiting because of an alarming
shortage of frontline troops -- just months after swingeing cuts.
A senior defence source has told The Herald that drastic measures are
needed, because it is obvious that reductions under the Options for
Change and Front Line First reviews have been too deep. Under these
reviews, the Army's numbers have been cut by nearly 40,000 to 112,000.
To fight the battle, the Army's advertising budget has been nearly
doubled and much of the increase will be used to win the hearts and
minds of potentially one of the service's most intractable opponents --
mothers reluctant to let their offspring join up.
''Our research shows that mothers are the key to the recruitment of
young soldiers and we have to get our image right,'' the defence source
said. Increasing recruiting was the top priority at the moment. ''We
have to ensure all our battalions are fully operational.''
In an embarrassing about-turn on cost-cutting measures, the Government
has already announced that 400 Gurkhas due to be made redundant next
year will be reprieved, to help the Army meet the dramatic shortfall in
recruits. A #1400 cash bonus is to be offered to soldiers to persuade
them to stay on for three years.
However, the Army will still be undermanned by about 2000 soldiers
next year, predominantly in the infantry, Royal Artillery, and Royal
Armoured Corps.
To combat this, defence chiefs are also looking at halting the closure
of the Army's 126 recruitment offices, reinstating the Junior Leaders
system of early training for promising 16-year-olds, and reversing
apprenticeship cuts.
Commanding officers of battalions are to be given an extra #1.5m to be
used specifically for recruiting in their local areas.
Army units, such as the Royal Engineers where recruits learn a trade,
are fully manned in comparison to the frontline battalions.
The Army plans to emphasise the skills acquired in the frontline
units, which can be turned into respected National Vocational
Qualifications, and improved resettlement packages to allow soldiers to
boost their qualifications in their final six months.
''Mums are keen to see their children learn a trade so that they find
a job easily when they return to Civvy Street, and we have to take
account of that,'' said the source.
The decision to disband the Junior Leaders system, which made up a
third of all recruits, has proved costly in recruitment terms and could
be reinstated.
It took promising 16-year-olds straight from school and put them on to
intensive leadership courses, with the aim of producing future senior
NCOs and regimental sergeant-majors.
As they were earmarked for early promotion, they tended to remain
longer in the Army, thus saving money and reducing recruitment needs.
Although the Government announced last month that it was to go ahead
with plans to close more than two-thirds of its 126 recruitment offices
and concentrate promotion in JobCentres, many are likely to be saved.
Defence chiefs now admit that the JobCentre scheme does not work well
enough to meet recruitment needs.
Similarly, numerous apprenticeships axed under cash-saving projects
are expected to be reinstated, with plans for a central tri-service
apprentice school now under consideration.
An Army recruiting sergeant in Glasgow said they had parked an
ad-trailer outside The Herald's offices in the hope that we would pick
up on the story.
He said: ''People have seen the amalgamations and disbandments and
have been under the impression that we are not recruiting, but we are.
The trailer will go round the West of Scotland to recruit the teeth
arms, which is what we call the frontline troops.''

THE Government has agreed to pay Assessment Services Ltd #1.95m to
take the National Engineering Laboratory in East Kilbride off its hands,
prompting condemnation of an unacceptable ''sweetener'' from Labour.
In the sale, which was completed on Monday, ASL, a subsidiary of
Siemens Group, will take over NEL's assets and its 223 staff and receive
the subsidy, which could vary slightly based on final estimations of the
assets' value.
The company was chosen, over two rival bids, to take over the
laboratory in August.
The Department of Trade and Industry announced in April last year that
it planned to privatise its research laboratories but it is understood
to have discovered resistance from the private sector.
The Government defended the decision as the best solution for NEL but
Shadow Industry Minister Adam Ingram claimed it amounted to a subsidy at
the expense of the taxpayer.
Mr Ingram said: ''In their desperation to off-load their
responsibility for Government-led research and development, the
Government has now descended to a new low. There can be no justification
for using taxpayers' money in this way.
''The only interpretation which can be placed on this decision is that
it is a sweetener to the new owners of NEL.''
SNP trade and industry spokesman Andrew Welsh MP accused the DTI of
''playing fast and loose with the public purse'' over the proposed deal.
He said: ''They are quick to hand out money to private companies but
slow when it comes to investing in the public good.''
Mr Ian Taylor, the Industry Minister responsible, said: ''This
represents a highly satisfactory outcome for Government and for NEL.
ASL's strengths complement those of the NEL and they propose to build on
all of its activities to enable it to compete successfully in world
markets.''

Major limits Nolan plans.
inal bid to curb the 'sleaze'
THE Tory ''sleaze'' factor in politics is to be put to a final test on
Monday in the Commons over the Nolan Report.
The Prime Minister will propose a ban on ''paid advocacy'', but is
still resisting a full disclosure of MPs' sideline earnings.
The former involves cash payments to MPs for speaking up on behalf of
parliamentary lobby groups, the latter publication of full details of
income from consultancy work.
Labour leader Tony Blair declared last night Mr Major has caved in to
a revolt by some of his high-earning back benchers and that he has
failed to implement as promised the recommendations of the independent
committee.
''This was a big test for the Prime Minister and he has failed it,''
Mr Blair said. ''This shameful episode exposes the Conservative Party
for what it is: not a political party running the country in the
national interest but a vested interest, a faction looking after
itself.''
On Monday night there is to be a series of ''free'' votes on the
issues.
There is heavy unofficial whipping on both sides to ensure full
attendance for this high-key confrontation between Mr Major and Mr
Blair.
The Labour Party, out-voted in the all-party Commons Select Committee
reporting on Nolan is insisting that MPs' outside earnings should be
made public by means of income bands: up to #1000; #5000-#10,000; and
thereafter in bands of #5000.
Today Government motions and Labour amendments will be tabled for
Monday's debate.
The Government insisted it is implementing the Nolan Report and going
further in establishing a total ban on what it calls paid advocacy in
the Commons chamber and in Bill committees. Henceforth MPs may be
advisers but not advocates.
At the same time a Parliamentary Commissioner is to be appointed who
will regulate and advise MPs in specific detail on what they can and
cannot do.
Mr Blair sees a big loophole for MPs who take on consultancies without
having to declare their earnings from them.
There are already five Tory back benchers threatening to vote with
Labour. Last night ex-Cabinet Minister John Biffen, a former Leader of
the House of Commons, was joined by Sir Teddy Taylor and three other
Tory back benchers, in saying they may have to vote against the
Government for full disclosure of MPs' earnings on the sidelines.
However, their intentions could be balanced by Ulster Unionist MPs who
may not vote.
The Prime Minister wants to bring to an end the ''sleaze'' factor that
has dogged his Government since 1992. Two Tory back benchers have been
suspended from the Commons for up to three months as punishment for
their paid lobbying and Ministers' conduct has been brought into
question forcing resignations, as in the case of former Northern Ireland
Minister Michael Mates and ex-Trade Minister Neil Hamilton.
On Monday night Mr Major hopes to draw a line under this unhappy last
three years which have brought Parliament into disrepute.
In another aspect of the wider issue, Harrods owners Mohamed Al Fayed
last night addressed the privileges committee in its inquiry over the
Guardian using Commons headed notepaper in a fax sent to Mr Al Fayed's
Ritz Hotel. Mr Fayed, who arrived in a Harrods van, refused detail his
evidence in the affair, which concerned ex-abinet Minister Jonathan
Aitken.
Yesterday the all-party Select Committee on Standards in Public Life
reported to the Commons. The key proposal that MPs' earnings from
outside interests should be disclosed was defeated by the casting vote
of its chairman, Commons Leader Tony Newton.
The Select Committee report rejected calls by the Nolan Committee to
distinguish between the various kinds of lobbying organisations for
which MPs work. Nolan was particularly concerned about MPs who work for
lobbying firms with multiple clients, because it is difficult to
ascertain the clients which the MPs are ultimately representing.
The Commons Select Committee states: ''Having wrestled with this
problem at great length and in exhaustive detail, we have been driven to
the conclusion that the Nolan Committee's attempt to regulate merely the
types of outside bodies with which Members should be allowed to have a
paid relationship will not work.
''The difficulties of definition, and therefore of enforcement, are
simply too great. Our alternative approach in fact goes significantly
further than the Nolan recommendations. It would address Members'
relations with both single client and multi-client consultancies.''
The vote will be on this key question of whether MPs should have
outside interests apart from their regular professions, and if they do
whether they should be made to disclose how much they earn from them.
Labour wants such earnings to be deposited with the new Parliamentary
Commissioner and disclosed. Mr Major is resisting disclosure on the
grounds that it is too complicated and would need law to enforce.
Mr Biffen said: ''I want to try and outflank the public anxiety about
political standards, and therefore I think that your non-parliamentary
income is a matter of public interest that out-weighs the hitherto
legitimate concern about privacy.''
With Mr Blair determined to keep the Tory ''sleaze'' factor in front
of the public, Labour will cast the Tories as determined to defend their
right to keep their earnings secret.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Demorat leader, said: ''Mr Major's
reputation is on the line. He made clear that he wanted to see the Nolan
report adopted in full, and it is his own party now which is blocking
that.''
He added: ''Parliament's reputation is at stake.''

THE public is turning away from whisky because of the soaring cost of
a bottle of Scotland's national drink, it was revealed yesterday. Sales
in the UK tumbled by 2.5m bottles in just six months following the
Chancellor's decision, last December, to increase duty by 26p.
Last year, 130 million bottles of whisky were sold in the UK.
The knock-on effect has led to the closure of four distilleries in
Scotland and the loss of more than 100 jobs, unions and industry experts
claim.
The greatest cost, however, may have been to the Treasury which has
lost #54m in excise duty receipts in the six months since April. The
measure, imposed by Mr Kenneth Clarke following the decision to drop
plans to raise VAT on domestic fuel, was supposed to raise an extra #25m
for the Treasury.
Union representatives from the whisky industry, which directly employs
14,000 people, met with the general council of the STUC in Glasgow
yesterday to call for measures to reverse the slump in the whisky
market.
Mr Richard Leonard, STUC assistant secretary, said the unions had
expressed genuine concerns about the future of jobs in distilleries and
bottling plants.
''The mini-Budget increase has badly depressed demand for whisky in
the home market,'' he said. ''The latest Custom and Excise figures show
the Chancellor shot himself in the foot when he slapped the increase on
spirit duty.''
Mr Leonard said the STUC would be writing to the Chancellor asking him
to reverse his decision on the tax increase in this month's Budget.
''With 14,000 people employed directly in the industry and over 30,000
more in Scottish-based suppliers of raw materials and services, we are
anxious to see a boost being given to the industry in the Budget,'' he
said.
Mr Campbell Evans, of the Scotch Whisky Association, confirmed that
excise revenues had fallen by more than #50m and said that duty was paid
when whisky was removed from bonded warehouses and not when bottles were
sold across the counter -- hence retailers might be sitting with large
numbers of cases in store.
''There is a significant drop in what is leaving the bonds and we
believe the market is down 2.5 million bottles. We don't think there is
any doubt that the increase in duty is the cause.''
''In 1992, tax went up by a similar amount and in the full financial
year #80m was lost. The message is clear and consistent to the
Chancellor and is coming from the industry, independent bodies, and now
the unions.''
During trade questions in the Commons yesterday, SNP parliamentary
leader Mrs Margaret Ewing pointed out that 45,000 jobs in Scotland were
dependent on the industry and argued it was time that excise duties were
put on a level footing with the rest of Europe.
She wanted representations made by the Department of Trade and
Industry to the Treasury.
Trade Minister Phillip Oppenheim said there were wide-ranging contacts
at all levels with the Scotch Whisky Association and told Mrs Ewing: ''I
expect the Chancellor, who has been known to enjoy the odd glass of
whisky himself, will take your comments into account at the end of this
month.''

<HEADLINE>Government blamed as Kirk closes four homes for elderly</HEADLINE>

Kirk's funding crisis hits the elderly
FOUR Church of Scotland homes for the elderly, with 84 residents and
65 staff, are to close, with warnings that more could follow.
Five years ago, the Kirk first warned the Government this would happen
unless more funding was made available.
Its board of social responsibility claimed the Government was the
''core sinner''.
''The people who will suffer most are the older people who will lose
their home and the staff who have been caring for them.''
The four to be closed are Blair House, Trossachs; St Andrew's, Dunbar;
Cliff House, Aberdeen; and Edinburgh's Varrich House, which has lain
empty for some months now with no money available for renovation.
Detailed discussions with residents and their families are under way to
find the best alternatives.
The board said it was taking the step reluctantly and at the same time
indicated ''with great regret'' that unless central and local government
improved the financial position more would go.
This would be needed to reduce the deficit, this year estimated at
#2.4m, for care of elderly people.
Age Concern Scotland reacted with dismay at the announcement which
comes on the eve of its ''Great Debate -- Paying for long-term care for
older people'' at New Parliament House in Edinburgh, sponsored by The
Herald.
''I am very sympathetic to the situation the Kirk finds itself in,''
said Ms Maureen O'Neill, its director. ''If voluntary organisations are
expected to play a role in providing good-quality mainstream services,
their real costs have to be met. They should not be treated as a cheap
option.
''Age Concern Scotland calls on the Government to provide an immediate
injection of funds and to draw up a coherent strategy for long-term
care.''
Mr Ian Baillie, the Kirk's social work director, said the board, like
many voluntary organisations which for many years had worked and
supported services provided by local authorities, had been ''badly let
down''.
The Kirk was caught between Government saying it had given the money
to local government to deal with the financial care gap, and local
authorities denying this position.
The board, which cares for 1042 residents in 43 homes, said it had
been warning the Government its funding of Scotland's poorest older
people who need residential care would lead to closures of homes managed
by the voluntary sector.
''Over the past five years, the board has used in excess of #10m of
its reserves to meet the difference between the Government fee of #197
per resident per week and the board's weekly care cost of #310, and it
could no longer carry this debt.
Although funding responsibility for new residents passed to local
authorities in 1993, the Government figures applied to residents in care
before that date, and had been used by councils as the ''bench mark''
for the fees they were prepared to agree.
''Only Lothian Regional Council and Shetland Islands Council have
improved on these rates in a manner which has made an impact. All other
local authorities have increased the Government rate only marginally,
thus adding to the debt incurred by the board.''
It said it would continue to press for changes to prevent any further
closures.
Mr Baillie said: ''The bottom line is while the Government is the core
sinner, most local authorities have failed to follow the example of
Lothian and Shetland.''
The Rev Bill Wallace, board convener, said: ''Nothing can compensate
for removing an old person's home for financial reasons not of their
making. I am pleased the board has been able to show its Christian
concern through its use of reserves even although this commitment has
prevented building improvements and new developments.''
A Cosla spokeswoman said the Government had ''inflicted a very severe
financial regime'' on local authorities over the past few years.
Councils were having to look at closing their own old peoples' homes
which did not meet the standards they set and for which there was no
money available to rectify this.
A Scottish Office spokesman said the Government recognised there was a
''care gap'' situation and in the current financial year approximately
#14m had been identified for Scottish local authorities to help address
the problem.
