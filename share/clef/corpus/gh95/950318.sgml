THE rather rosy picture painted by Andrew Turner, director of
Grant-Maintained Initiative, does not bear out the facts as they stand
on opted-out schools in England and Wales (March 16).
There are about 24,000 schools in England and Wales and of these just
over 1000 have opted out. About one-third of these schools came from
three local education authorities which were formerly
Conservative-controlled councils, and which were clearly working to the
agenda set by the Government, which was to remove local authority
control over education.
At the moment in England and Wales there is an outcry from parents who
now feel that they have been duped into opting out as the Treasury is
cutting back the amount of money available to them.
At the start, the political will and finance was in place to entice
people to opt out, but where you had the strength of a local authority
to protect services in times of financial stringency, you do not have
this for a small group of parents trying to run a schools and who have
listened to the promises made to them. This makes them very easy to pick
off from a distance by the Government.
The most important point is that in times of trouble you cannot opt
back in again. Once you are out you are out, and parents in England and
Wales are now having to fight to maintain the educational standards that
they had when they were under local authority control.
Who wants to work full-fime during the day and then take on the
responsibility of running an educational business at night when you have
a family to look after and a home to run?
Scottish parents have proved that political dogma has no place in the
education of their children. They want stability and moderation, not
uncertainty and educational extremism. That is something Mr Turner may
have a problem coming to terms with.

BRIAN MEEK LOOKS DOWN MEMORY LANE
* 1971. Twickenham. I was there. In my mind's eye I can still see
Chris Rea scuttling in near the posts for the try which took the score
to 15-14 in England's favour. We still had to kick the goal.
Up sauntered PC Brown. The ball was placed, his back was turned, his
nose was wiped, then biff, and it was all over.
Years later, PC and I sat in a London theatre and he told me how he
had felt at that famous moment. ''I had waited my whole life to kick
that goal,'' he declared. ''As a kid I used to pretend I was taking the
vital penalty against the English -- though at that stage I thought the
sport would be football.''
''Obviously, I enjoyed being part of the first Scottish side to win at
Twickenham since the war,'' Rea told me recently. ''Yet, in a way, the
more remarkable fact is that we beat them again at Murrayfield the
following Saturday.''
Yes, and a lot easier, too. This was the special game to mark 100
years of competition between the countries, and Scotland, who went on to
win 26-6, had scored a try, conversion, and a penalty before the
kick-off time.
For some reason Welsh referee Merion Joseph started proceedings three
minutes early. John Frame scored in about 12 seconds, PC converted and
landed a penalty. It was still not three o'clock.
* 1983. Twickenham. I was there. So was Roy Laidlaw, the magnificent
Jed-Forest scrum half, though he was feeling a wee bit sore when he
arrived.
Roy had been relieved of the Scottish captaincy, which had been handed
to Jim Aitken. ''It had been felt that leading the side had affected my
game. I thought our poor results that season were more due to the
absence of John Rutherford from the field, and Jim Telfer from coaching.
''Make no mistake, Jim Aitken made a fine captain and he was a bit
more flamboyant than me. But I was determined to prove a point and to
win my spot on the Lions' tour to New Zealand.''
He did both. Laidlaw was the outstanding back, capping his display
with a crucial try as Scotland raced to a 22-12 victory.
Tom Smith, the big Gala lock, had a try-scoring debut. He went over
from a lineout, with David Leslie at his side and Jim Aitken's boot on
his backside. The new skipper was determined to make an impression!
Tell me, Roy, how can we win today? ''We have to win a fair share of
possession and we have to use that ball to our best advantage. Nor can
we afford to give away early scores.
''I am not pessimistic. They will start favourites and that is right.
''Yet our lads have improved with every game. England have not played
for a month and that is not what they would have wanted. We will see
what the English full back and wingers are made of.
''Bryan Redpath is a key man. He could take some of the pressure off
his backs by kicking well. It is going to be some day.''
* 1995. Twickenham. I am here. Go for it, Gav.

SO very far, and so very good. The Five Nations' Championship trail
began back in early February, and today at Twickenham, Gavin Hastings
and his Scotland side have the chance to make history and grab for
themselves a mighty slice of rugby immortality.
The victory over Canada at Murrayfield on January 21 was but the
taster for what was to come. The tide turned then, and the grim run of
nine games without a win was brought to a shuddering halt.
Scotland manager Duncan Paterson has shepherded his side each step of
the way along the Five Nations' trail. Yesterday, as the Scots trained
at the London Scottish ground, Paterson cannily observed that as the
championship campaign had developed, they had taken just the one
tentative step at a time.
''With each match, the steps have been getting longer. Twickenham
represents the final step,'' he declared.
Today, there is no greater prize to be had in Northern Hemisphere
rugby. Just as in 1990, when the Scots vanquished the English at
Murrayfield, both sides have within their grasp the Grand Slam, the
Triple Crown, the Calcutta Cup, and the championship.
Hastings, too, was eagerly mindful of the glittering purse that lies
in store for today's victors.
''Coming to Twickenham with the Grand Slam in our sights is a unique
occasion and it is the biggest game that any of us have ever played in.
That includes the four of us who played in the 1990 match.''
The challenge facing the Scots is enormous. Leave aside the physical
hurdle posed by Will Carling and his English juggernauts.
The historical precedents, too, weigh heavily against the Scots.
England have won 10 Grand Slams to Scotland's three, and Scottish sides
have won only twice at Twickenham since the war.
Today, though, the history books can be consigned to the back shelves.
When Scotland won in Paris four weeks ago, they had not done so since
1969. That is the positive attitude which the Scots will take with them
on to the Twickenham turf this afternoon.
They will take with them, too, the game plan devised by coaches Dougie
Morgan and Richie Dixon, which they believe has the capacity to halt the
lilly-whites.
The coaches and the players expect the big English back-row of Rodber,
Richards, and Clarke to charge hard and fast at Scotland's midfield
backs.
The Scottish strategy, based initially on offensive defence, will be
to tackle, tackle, and tackle again. No-one, Dixon declares, has yet
rattled England's teeth.
To succeed Scotland must achieve parity in the set-piece. The Scottish
scrummage should hold, but at the lineout England have a towering
advantage. Martin Johnson, at 6ft 7in, is an imposing enough figure, but
Martin Bayfield, at 6ft 10in, is in the stratosphere.
At the tail of the line, too, with Rodber, Clarke and Richards
measuring up at 6ft 4in to 6ft 6in, England have a towering advantage.
All of which represents a tall order for Weir, Campbell and the Scottish
back-row trio. They will, though, seek to ensure that, on the English
throw-in, mayhem rules and that scrum half Kyran Bracken would rather he
had stayed at home.
Scotland possesses power and pace in the threequarters. Scott
Hastings, fulfilling the Ian Jardine role at inside centre, brings
experience and knock-'em-dead tackle power to the equation.
It is probably asking too much of Gregor Townsend for a repeat of the
ethereal break and pass which led to the captain's Parc des Princes try,
but the Gala youngster possesses such pace and footballing skill that,
if he is on song, he could be the key to Scottish victory today.
Expect, early on, some towering garryowens from Craig Chalmers. The
English back three, Mike Catt and the Underwoods, are fickle defenders
and it will be interesting to note how they cope when turning to
retrieve with, all the while, the sound of Scottish hoofbeats pounding
in their ear drums.
The Scotland winger Kenny Logan, for one, is particularly keen to ask
some tricky questions of his opposite number Tony Underwood.
Scottish preparations for today's game have gone well. There has been
no grandiose talk of derring-do, just a calm and reasoned reckoning that
they have earned the right to play England in this winner-take-all
shoot-out.
Scotland enter today's epic encounter as the underdogs. They don't
mind. As Paterson, says, they love it. On paper, the Scots stand little
chance of crowning a glorious season with all the prizes that the game
has to offer. But, as the wise man said, we're not playing them on
paper.

THE disappearance of rural petrol stations and post offices must be
tackled by the Government as it draws up new policies to help rural
Scotland, council leaders insisted yesterday.
They also warned Ministers to listen to the views of people living in
rural communities and find out what was important to them.
Cosla's rural affairs committee vice-convener, Mr Andrew Tulley, said
the threat to rural filling stations was typical of the kind of issue
which must be dealt with in the White Paper promised for the autumn.
Speaking at a meeting in Edinburgh, Councillor Tulley said: ''We must
continue to work to ensure that customers do not suffer more
disadvantages in the future with rural petrol stations becoming a thing
of the past and consumers forced to travel many miles to their nearest
fuel supply.''
The committee also discussed the difficulties faced by rural post
offices and agreed Cosla should continue to press the Government to
develop proposals for giving the Post Office greater commercial freedom.

SOUTHAMPTON manager Alan Ball has named Bruce Grobbelaar in his squad
for the meeting with Nottingham Forest at the City Ground, but refuses
to reveal if he will replace David Beasant, who deputised in midweek
when the Zimbabwean internationalist emerged from 32 hours in police
custody following their probe into bribery claims.
Ball said no announcement will be made until half-an-hour before
kick-off in line with normal team procedure.
Meanwhile, Southampton have signed Sheffield Wednesday striker Gordon
Watson in a #1.2m deal in time for him to face Forest.
Hans Segers is set to win a place on Wimbledon's substitutes' bench
for the home match with landlords Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.
Segers, also questioned this week by police investigating match-fixing
allegations, has been pencilled in as back-up to keeper Neil Sullivan.
* BARCELONA have suspended Bulgarian internationalist Hristo Stoichkov
for a fortnight after publicly criticising his team-mates and coach
Johan Cruyff.
Stoichkov claimed Cruyff had made serious errors in the transfer
market, questioning the wisdom of letting Denmark's Michael Laudrup and
Brazilian Romario leave the club.

THE bottom fell out of Nigel Mansell's full-time Formula One comeback
yesterday with confirmation that he is too big to fit comfortably into
the cockpit of McLaren's new MP4/10 car.
Mansell's hopes of retaining the title he won in 1992 could be
handicapped by any lead established by Benetton's Michael Schumacher or
Williams' Damon Hill while he sits out the first two championship races.
Fellow Briton Mark Blundell will now partner Finland's Mika Hakkinen
in the Brazilian and Argentinian grands prix while a new chasis is
built.
''Mansell had a seat fitting in the factory and professed himself to
be quite comfortable,'' said McLaren spokesman Norman Howell. ''But
driving a car at 200mph is quite different from sitting in a factory
doing a seat test.''
Williams opted for Scot David Coulthard ahead of Mansell -- but
Coulthard said yesterday he was disappointed not to be facing Mansell.

STEVE Archibald found the target the last time he played at Broadwood,
even if it was the only goal that the East Fife player-manager has
scored this season. The Fifers could do with some more of the veteran's
magic this afternoon, as they are running out of Saturdays if they still
harbour notions of gaining promotion.
Very shortly, one suspects, it will be apparent that East Fife are
certain to remain in the second division, and other clubs will begin to
make enquiries about their players. Midfielder Ronnie Hildersley may
well be one who will be lured elsewhere.
Today's opponents, Clyde, will expect to be involved in the promotion
race for much longer, but there was no doubt that they suffered a
setback to morale, as well as their goal difference, when they went down
4-1 to Morton in midweek.
The Greenock team visit Brechin, the bottom club, who held out at
Broadwood for 85 minutes last week but will probably not stay on level
terms for as long today.
Dumbarton, who took five goals off Stenhousemuir during the week, are
back on home ground against another promotion-chasing outfit, Berwick,
who have a good record at Boghead. The game is subject to a morning
inspection.
And what of Stenhousemuir? This time last week their stock was high,
with an excellent chance of promotion to the first division and a cup
run which had taken them to a quarter-final against Hibs. A few days
later and suddenly they have conceded nine goals in two games.
This afternoon they must visit Stirling Albion, who surely must
consider that they have to win home games to have any chance of
promotion.
Forfar seem to be marching on towards the third-division title and,
being unbeaten at home, are unlikely to be stopped today by Caledonian
Thistle.
Promotion contenders Alloa have the doubtful pleasure of having to
visit the team of the moment, Arbroath, who have won five straight games
under John Brogan.
Montrose have run out of steam but must try to take at least a point
off Ross County at Dingwall, where a morning inspection will take place,
while East Stirlingshire should stay in the hunt by beating Albion
Rovers at Coatbridge.

STAY cool, calm, and you will collect. Dundee manager Jim Duffy's
outlook is similar to the way he still plays as a sweeper -- the
second-last line of defence who has to take the pressure off his keeper.
And with the battle now joined for promotion -- the Dens men,
Dunfermline, and Raith Rovers are level on points, with Airdrie close
behind and St Johnstone still striving to be part of the final equation
-- then the team which plays for the gain and takes the strain will see
premier-division football next season.
The relegation issue is just as vital, and with top meeting bottom in
one of those fixture situations thrown up well in advance by the
league's computer -- nine out of the 10 teams are fighting for
something.
Hamilton Accies are the odd squad out, and could be termed as the
Grand Old Duke of York's men -- when they are only halfway up, they are
neither up nor down.
But back to Duffy and Dundee, who will have to do without defenders
Noel Blake, Mark Hutchison, Mike Teasdale, and keeper Paul Mathers
because of injury. Duffy said yesterday: ''I suppose I'm a bit like Ivan
Golac was, down the road at Tannadice. Yes, I feel responsibility to the
club, the players, and the fans, but I don't feel the pressure.''
John McQuillan, Paul Tosh, and Andy Cargill are back in the squad to
face an unpredictable Clydebank side, who have Scott Murdoch and Craig
Thomlinson suspended, and Craig Flannigan injured.
Leaders Dunfermline still have half a first-team squad either injured
or suspended as they travel to Firhill to meet an Accies side playing
for pride. The Firhill pitch will decide once more whether or not anyone
plays at all.
Raith Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl, with Shaun Dennis and Steven
McAnespie suspended, will have to reshuffle his team for the first time
for several weeks. And he doesn't think that will be too bad, with David
Kirkwood, Dave Narey, Ronnie Coyle, and Gordon Dalziel -- who scored
four times in a midweek reserve match -- all ready for a recall against
Stranraer at Stark's Park.
Stranraer are missing four suspended players -- three of them
defenders -- in Kenny Brannigan, Nigel Howard, John McCaffrey, and
Darren Henderson.
Ayr United manager Simon Stainrod, still on the hunt for points to get
clear of the relegation zone, reckons that nine from the remaining nine
games might be enough to keep his side in the first division. Airdrie,
still on a roll after their Scottish Cup success, will contest three of
them at Somerset Park.
St Johnstone travel to Paisley with Peter Davenport doubtful because
of a flu virus, while St Mirren will be without the suspended David
Byrne and Steve Watson. Substitutes Jamie Fullarton and Barry Lavety are
not bad cover in anyone's book.

<TEXT>
ANGRY may not be quite a strong enough word to sum up Chris Eubank's
mood in the countdown to his fifteenth WBO super-middleweight title
defence in the rural setting of Millstreet tonight.
It was taken as no Irish joke when his latest challenger, Dubliner
Steve Collins, riled him at a news conference six weeks ago when he
accused his opponent of forgetting his roots -- and Eubank is still
seething about it.
In Eubank's last defence, against Henry Wharton in December, he turned
in a top-class display to keep his title without a trace of controversy.
Eubank has a list of narrow squeaks but is less vulnerable with Puerto
Rican judges at ringside -- to date, nine Puerto Ricans have scored
exclusively in the champion's favour -- and two more will compile the
points this time.
''If Steve wins the fight, it does not mean he'll get the decision,
especially against Eubank -- I should know,'' said Ulsterman Ray Close,
who drew and lost to Eubank in controversial finishes.
Collins, one-time Boston-based holder of the WBO middleweight crown,
is widely experienced and his three career defeats have been against
world champions Mike McCallum, Reggie Johnson, and Sumbu Kalambay.
But Collins has not fought before at the 12st super-middleweight
limit, and has not met a truly front-ranking opponent for a couple of
years, although he is very resilient, and has never been stopped in 31
bouts.
''Eubank's negative style bores me. I have no fear of him after going
with a true great like McCallum,'' said Collins. He would dearly love to
give Ireland the title to climax the St Patrick's Day bank holiday, but
he is not a big puncher and must base his strategy on outworking his
opponent.

EXCLUSIVE
SCOTTISH Nuclear, the state-owned operator of the Hunterston and
Torness power stations, is fighting an intense private battle to avoid
being taken over by its larger southern rival, Nuclear Electric.
If that were to be the outcome of the Government's nuclear review --
and Nuclear Electric is now lobbying hard to ensure that it is -- the
jobs of 350 staff at Scottish Nuclear's East Kilbride headquarters would
immediately come under threat.
Nuclear Electric is, in turn, fighting off a proposal that ownership
of its eight ageing Magnox stations should be transferred to British
Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), in preparation for NE's privatisation in 1996. It
wants to continue running the Magnoxes, under licence to the Government.
But, as part of its campaign, Nuclear Electric is now urging Ministers
to add the two Scottish stations to its existing portfolio of five AGR
(advanced gas-cooled reactor) stations, and the new pressurised water
reactor, Sizewell B.
It believes that would give the business the kind of critical mass
needed for a successful share offering, and to be able to compete
effectively in the international marketplace for nuclear power.
If that were to happen -- and there is mounting Scottish concern that
Mr Michael Heseltine's Department of Trade and Industry is coming round
to the idea -- Scottish Nuclear's corporate structure would be rendered
redundant.
Up to 350 of a total of 1850 jobs, a major Scottish headquarters, and
the new cost-conscious culture -- built up by Scottish Nuclear since the
privatisation of the rest of the electricity supply industry -- would be
lost.
Both Scottish Nuclear and the Scottish Office are understood to be
urging a rival privatisation scenario in which Scottish Nuclear takes
over the running of two of Nuclear Electric's AGRs.
That would create two competing nuclear businesses of similar size and
would, its advocates argue, offer the best prospect of a successful
privatisation.
There are suggestions that the Treasury may favour this model.

ALTHOUGH unconfirmed by association president John McDougall, it
appears that a move to expel the Clyde club from the national governing
body will now be withdrawn before it is voted on at tomorrow's general
meeting of the SARA.
Clyde's debts for last season had not been paid and as a result, the
expulsion motion was tabled by the executive committee. Sources from
outwith the association have confirmed that Clyde have paid the money
that was owed, so it would appear that the association's sledge-hammer
tactics have worked.
On a less contentious note, Matt Smith, the American who is
development officer for FISA, the world governing body, will address
tomorrow's meeting on details of how the sport is being expanded.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns is close to settling new contracts with
some of the players whose current deals end this summer, but he is not
optimistic about signing a new player before the end of the month, when
the transfer deadline is reached.
''It could still happen, but it is difficult when teams don't want to
let players go at this stage of the season,'' he said.
Those seeking new deals include Brian O'Neil, Tony Mowbray, Mark
McNally, and Paul McStay. ''I would hope to have them sorted out within
the next week or so. It is not something we have been chasing every day,
but we have had talks with two or three of the players.''
McNally has been on a monthly-contract basis all season, but McStay is
coming to the end of a long contract, while Mowbray has already
indicated he wants to stay.
O'Neil is suspended for the next two games and Burns brings in McNally
and Rudi Vata to the squad to face Partick Thistle at Hampden.
Vata, the versatile Albanian, has not had a chance to show his worth
to the manager but could come into O'Neil's place but there are other
options, like McNally, or even a switch for Tommy Boyd with Peter Grant
moving to full back.
Grant was left out of the midfield in the cup-tie last week for
tactical reasons, but Burns would not say whether he would be recalled.
He has seen a fresh buoyancy in the dressing room since the cup win
over Kilmarnock. ''The atmosphere the supporters created, and the fact
that we won, has given the players a fantastic lift,'' he said, ''and
they know there is a lot to play for yet. As well as the cup semi-final
to come, we are only a point behind Hibs and we want to finish the
season with a flourish.''
He appreciates the determination being shown by Thistle as they chase
survival points. ''They work hard for each other and make it difficult
for any team.''
Thistle should have everybody available from the midweek draw with
Motherwell, although Wayne Foster has been recovering from a virus.
Manager John Lambie, who admitted during the week that his players were
a bit leg-weary after the succession of tough games they have faced,
will think about changes if only to bring in fresher legs.
Rangers manager Walter Smith, who would not comment on any of the
speculation about players he is intending to sign, has Trevor Steven and
Alex Cleland fit again, but Craig Moore and Charlie Miller are
suspended. He is not interested in revenge talk about Hearts, their
conquerors in the cup. ''The only motivation we need is the
championship. That should enough for anybody.''
Hearts will still be without suspended Craig Levein, but Jim Bett is
back after his ban, while Kevin Thomas and Brian Hamilton face fitness
tests. The match is subject to an inspection at 9am.
Aberdeen take on Hibs at Pittodrie as they continue to battle against
relegation, but the good news for caretaker manager Roy Aitken is that
he has his most experienced pool available since he took over. Striker
Duncan Shearer is fit again, and defender John Inglis back after
suspension.
''The situation we are in will be a test of character and requires
experience,'' said Aitken. ''I will be looking for the older players to
handle it. At our best, we are as good as any team in the country but so
far have not been nearly consistent enough.''
Hibs will have Pat McGinlay back after suspension.
Kilmarnock and Falkirk could put on the best show of the day, if their
3-3 draw the last time they met is a guide. Killie will have Tom Brown
back after suspension while Falkirk will have David Weir and Paul
McGrillen available after their enforced absences.
Dundee United also are in the danger zone, and caretaker manager
Gordon Wallace's first test is at Fir Park against second-top
Motherwell.
Fir Park manager Alex McLeish was due back from Holland last night
after having watched PSV Eindhoven defender Michel van der Gaag, whom he
hopes to sign for #400,000. With Chris McCart out for two weeks at least
after a cartilage operation, McLeish might want the Dutchman quicker
than he had planned.

RONNIE O'Sullivan took only 90 minutes to reach his first ranking
event final of the season at the Kloster Thailand Open yesterday in
Bangkok.
O'Sullivan defeated Canadian Cliff Thorburn 5-0, compiling breaks of
88, 80, 69, 33, and 58 in successive frames.
''I've put a lot of hard work in at the practice table out here and
it's paid off,'' said O'Sullivan, who will face the holder, James
Wattana, in the 17-frame final.
He added: ''I gave Cliff every respect because he is a class player. I
also didn't want to get involved in a tactical battle because had I
done, I would probably have come out second best.''
O'Sullivan, who defends his British Open crown next month, paid
tribute to fellow Englishman Tony Knowles for his help in Bangkok.
He said: ''It gets a bit lonely when you are on your own all this way
from home but Tony volunteered to stay on with me when he lost in the
first round a week ago.
''It was a great gesture from one of the few genuine players I know in
the game today.''
Thorburn, who appeared in his first semi-final for four years,
observed: ''Despite the scoreline, it was a pleasure to play against
someone so talented as Ronnie.
''I hadn't played him before but I have watched him in action and
three years ago I said he was Stephen Hendry, Steve Davis, and Willie
Thorne rolled into one.
''He is from a different world as far as this game is concerned. He is
unbelievable and so forceful at the table.''
Wattana joined O'Sullivan in the final after beating Mark
Johnston-Allen 5-1. The local player, gaining in confidence after a
disappointing season so far, fired in breaks of 88, 63, 51, and 50 to
reach his third Thailand Open final.

WITH sleeker curves than Cindy Crawford and more pulling power than
Sydney Devine on a wet Monday night in Saltcoats, the famed Chevrolet
Corvette is probably the world's ultimate sports car.
If you don't believe it, why not slip along to the new national museum
which opened recently in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to mark the car's
distinguished history?
The museum, which cost $15m, is expected to draw more than
half-a-million visitors from around the globe each year, making it one
of Kentucky's most popular tourist attractions.
The venture was funded through a consortium of public and private
sources including Corvette club members, dealers, suppliers, and owners
world-wide.
Set on a 33-acre site alongside the General Motors assembly plant that
builds the Corvette at a rate of 480 a week, the museum features more
than 50 Corvettes spanning its long career.
Fans of the 1960s cult television show, Route 66, will instantly
recognise one of the many features in the museum. A scene has been
specially created with a 1961 Corvette convertible and a vintage
Harley-Davidson motorcycle to underscore the era's romance with the open
highway.

I WAS with the team in their hotel, and for an old poofter like me, it
was easy to realise how emotionally charged a gathering of Scottish
rugby players can be as they count down to the Twickenham showdown. How
I wish I had been preserved for ever at the age of 27.
Emotion, nerves, pride and confidence are a potent mixture that brings
out the best in people who have reached the top, and humour inevitably
surfaced as Scotland's best waited . . . and waited. You find out what
people are really like at times like these.
Iain Morrison had a twinkle in his eye. ''I like Kenny Milne's
quote,'' he said. ''Kenny says that with the Calcutta Cup, Five Nations,
and Grand Slam all at stake then surely we're bound to win one of them.
You know, this English back row is so big and so good that, frankly . .
.'' His voice tails off in a whisper lost in laughter. Rob Wainwright
convulses.
''We've nothing to lose,'' says Wainwright. ''Except everything you
mention and, of course, a World Cup slot if we're really bad.''
''Do you know,'' says Morrison, warming to the task, ''that the
hardest player I ever played against only had one arm? He was a real
nutter.''
''Are you suggesting,'' asks Wainwright, ''that Ben Clark is,
therefore, at a disadvantage? See that Iain Morrison, he's a really
arrogant sod.''
''Arrogant English sod. That's what they say. I can't sleep in these
dammed hotels, they're too hot,'' says Morrison.
Humour is a release. It is humour laden with tension, humour filled
with expectancy, humour to make your stomach turn as you realise that
these 15 men carry the hopes of a small country, humour that makes you
plead that success will grace them on Saturday. Yes, this afternoon. The
humour of men going to war.
I instantly learn, of course, that Iain Morrison is not arrogant.
In another hotel room, Craig Chalmers and Kenny Logan plan for the big
day. Their voices are hushed tones of complexity. Gavin Hastings takes
his meal after a scamper up the stairs. People in the hotel watch and
stare. Stewart Campbell walks by blocking out the light. He has a hard
job to do in this game. Derrick Patterson, on the bench, joins the
back-row for some chat.
It's an old cliche, but the run-up to an international is a joy in the
days prior to the game as the team plans, catches up on all the gossip,
and enjoys its own special company.
Saturday mornings are different. Saturday mornings are a time of
self-examination. Are you good enough? Is the team ready? What do the
baddies in the opposition have up their sleeves? Will you get carted
off, injured, ignominiously?
Chalmers, now an old head with 40 caps, admits he will have nerves.
''I wake up at seven-thirty, tossing and turning, chewing the game over
in my head,'' he says. ''I'll do my boots, anything to keep busy.''
Many Scottish teams have frozen on the day at Twickenham before. Only
two wins since the war.
''We won't freeze,'' says Wainwright. ''There's just too much at
stake. We must use the tension and adrenalin to our advantage.''
There are hints that, having arrived at this Grand Slam epic after
having furnished the international table with the most attractive rugby
seen from a Scottish team in years, there may be a change in emphasis
for this game. ''We have a few things up our sleeves,'' says Chalmers.
''We might see little changes, we will do a few things differently.''
Peters thinks long and hard. ''We have been focusing on what we have
to do well for this game,'' he says. ''The English are good. Yes, I know
some of the lads in the opposition well, but I haven't talked with them
about the game at all.''
Wainwright gets a little more technical, still fighting not to give
any secrets away. ''We have to remain unpredictable, attacking close and
wide, but we may have to tighten it up against them,'' he says. ''We
might have to ruck more, but still keep it open if it is on to pass to
players in space. Most importantly, the front five have been getting us
possession and space. They are the really important ones.''
Craig Joiner pokes his head into Chalmers' room. Joiner, still only
20, has the task of marking Rory Underwood, and he is sure to be tested
early on by Rob Andrew's boot and Underwood's surges as they search deep
into his soul to see if he is yet made of the stuff that can make light
of war with rules.
I fancy that Joiner will be tested for security under the high ball, I
fancy that Logan will be tested for sheer speed by Tony Underwood, and I
fancy that Gregor Townsend and Craig Chalmers will have to cope with
straight running back-row men later this afternoon.
I see the English trying to win by a combination of pulverisation and
the odd flash of show-off, if they can, on their own pitch. They will
want to run in tries.
The Scots will want to win, any way, any how. They have done so much
this season in the face of all the criticism levelled at them, and I've
played my part in that, that I could not find it in my heart to be
savage with them even if they should lose. They are good people. You can
see it in their faces.
They came down to England with a game plan, a belly full of fight, and
self-belief. Later today, we'll find out if that will be enough.

TRACEY Craik, an Oxford-based Scot, continued her fine recovery with a
closing-round 71 yesterday to earn her players' card for the American
Express Tour at the qualifying school at La Manga, Spain.
Craik, with a 15-over-par aggregate of 303, earned a top-40 place with
five strokes to spare, but Jill Kinloch, on 309, missed out by one shot
following a 74, while Lindsey Irvine was a further stroke behind.
It was a good fightback by Craik. In the second round she fashioned a
much-needed birdie at the sixteenth to narrowly make the cut.
On Thursday, despite strong winds, she leapfrogged 30 places with a 73
which she followed with a 71 yesterday.
Craik had been one over for the day after having dropped a shot at the
fifteenth. But she struck a No.5-iron to eight feet for a 2 at the short
seventeenth before holing from five feet for another birdie at the last.
Kinloch and Irvine had outside chances of making the top-40 until the
closing holes. Kinloch dropped two strokes in her last five holes, while
Irvine dropped three over the same stretch.
Kirsty Speak, from Lancashire, was involved in a six-way, sudden-death
play-off for the last two places which went to Sweden's Marie Pettersson
and Deborah Eckroth, from the United States, who birdied the first extra
hole. Qualifiers (British and Ireland unless stated):

Afternoon tea is turning into a sparkling occasion in the salons of
Edinburgh, as Margaret Hughes discovered between glasses of fizz.
Balmoral Hotel, Edinburgh
Caledonian Hotel, EdinburghAFTERNOON tea is a treat most of us reserve
for high days and holidays. For an afternoon spent in self-indulgence it
is hard to beat the satisfying tinkle of china cups on saucers and the
smell of freshly brewed tea.
However, in the Palm Court of Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel during March,
afternoon tea has an added sparkle; in fact, a celebration of chocolate
and champagne.
The Palm Court is situated just off the reception area of the hotel;
with its glass domed ceiling, opulent furnishings, and tropical palms,
you could almost have stumbled into a grand hotel of the colonial era.
The waitress explained that if I did not want the glass of champagne
or chocolate cakes that were being served, I could just have some
scones. I quickly assured her that I never turn down chocolates -- or
champagne for that matter.
The afternoon tea, served from 2.30pm to 5.30pm at a cost of #10.75,
was huge, comprising four finger sandwiches, toasted chocolate brioche,
two chocolate scones, a chocolate cake, and strawberry tart. (Lunch
costs #7.50.)
First, the afternoon tea sandwiches. The smoked salmon was deliciously
smoky between two layers of fresh brown bread, the roast beef was a
little rare, but came in a nicely carved slice and soft white bread. The
egg mayonnaise was just right, and the ham with mustard very tasty.
On to the next treat. Closer examination revealed chocolate chips
rather than sultanas in the scones, and even at my greediest I could
never have managed two. The strawberry jam was sweet, the fresh cream
thick -- not the aerosol variety that falls flat in minutes. The toasted
chocolate brioche was delicately crunchy and delicious, eaten with no
accompaniments.
By this stage I could feel my sugar level rising, but determined to
have at least one bite of everything I attacked the strawberry tart with
a fork. The strawberries were fresh, sweet, and a welcome break from the
chocolate, the pastry light and crumbly. The small chocolate cake was
topped by scrolls of dark chocolate, and on breaking through the crisp
shell I discovered a sweet chocolate cream topping a crunchy chocolate
base.
I could manage only a mouthful; any more and I would have been in
danger of having consumed my annual quota of chocolate in one afternoon.
The tea was rich, full-bodied Assam, and the waitress offered more hot
water if I needed a top-up. The champagne was deliciously chilled, and
just as I thought I had had my fill of treats, the waitress arrived with
a dish of chocolate-covered Brazil nuts.
Further along Princes Street is the Caledonian Hotel, which has
wonderful views of the castle.
Traditional Afternoon Tea in the lounge, at #9.25, was a selection of
finger sandwiches, scones, pancakes, pastries, and cakes -- champagne is
also available with the #14 Celebration Tea. I chose the former.
The sandwiches were not substantial, but more than sufficient; the
smoked salmon was good and the brown bread fresh. The egg mayonnaise was
a delight, and the cucumber was thinly sliced between the softest white
bread.
I decided the Scotch pancake would be a pleasant change to scones.
Deliciously milky, with a scrape of butter it melted in the mouth. The
scone was topped with coconut to give a slightly crunchy texture.
The strawberry jam was a little too sweet and a little too ''solid'',
but the cream was thick and whipped to just the right consistency. The
strawberry crowning the tart was quite large and sweet, complemented by
the smoothness of the cream nestling in a light pastry cup.
The small fruit pastry was also very sweet, but the pastry was light
and although initially I thought it was a little bit on the small side,
it was just enough. The rich fruit cake was served in a thick slice and
was by turn crumbly, crunchy, and spicy.
I had decided on Earl Gray tea; the scent of Bergamot was strong and
the tea was delicate and plentiful. Service was extremely good, the
waitress again offering more hot water if I needed a refill.
RECOMMENDED
Cameron House Hotel, Loch Lomond, Alexandria, Dunbartonshire. Tel:
01389 55565.
GOOD Scottish food and wonderful views over Loch Lomond and the
surrounding countryside are just some of the highlights. Choose from a
simple bar lunch in the Marina Clubhouse or a gourmet meal in the
Georgian Room.
With the emphasis on Scottish produce, expect a feast of beef, lamb,
salmon, and seafood from the kitchen of Michelin-starred chef Jeff
Bland.
Puddings lean towards the traditional -- truly memorable is the bread
and butter pudding.
Sheraton Grand Hotel, 1 Festival Square, Edinburgh. Tel: 0131 229
9131.
THERE is a good choice of eating in this beautifully furnished hotel
that affords excellent views of Edinburgh Castle.
For an informal meal, the Terrace Restaurant is a good choice -- there
are themed nights, Sunday brunches, and food is prepared in the open
grill.
If you prefer something more formal, the Grill Room offers an
excellent choice.
The influence of French chef Jean Michel Gauffre is evident, but the
emphasis is on good Scottish produce. Highlights from a previous visit
include salmon, served with nettles, and a fruity Ecclefechan tart.
The Granary, 10 Kilmarnock Road, Glasgow. Tel: 0141 632 8474.
THIS hugely popular bar and restaurant on the city's south side can
become seriously busy in the evening, but if you are lucky you will find
a vacant table where you can try some  Mexican delights.
There is chicken in a dark, bitter chocolate sauce, a Mexican chicken
salad, and a choice of burritos and enchiladas.
If your taste runs to the more traditional, there are also burgers and
steaks in a variety of sizes.
Portions are large and service is prompt.

THE future of Alan Davies as Wales' coach goes on the line today when
Ireland arrive at Cardiff Arms Park for the Five Nations' Championship
wooden-spoon showdown.
With three successive defeats coming on the back of the November loss
to South Africa, Davies must be fearing for his future.
And to make matters worse, Davies saw his hand weakened considerably
yesterday when Swansea full back Tony Clement dropped out of the side
that has failed to find the form that clinched the championship last
year.
British Lion Clement failed to come through a training session after
having taken a knock in Thursday's work-out, raising fears that he has
suffered a recurrence of the concussion that kept him out of the clash
against Scotland.
His place has again gone to Bridgend's Matthew Back as Wales look to
end a dismal run which has seen them fail to win in last six meetings
against the Irish in Cardiff.
The form of half-backs Robert Jones, winning his fifty-second cap, and
Neil Jenkins will be vital if Wales -- and coach Davies -- are to
survive for the summer's World Cup with their integrity intact.
Jones' performance at Murrayfield one of the few bright spots in the
26-13 defeat by Scotland, but Jenkins wants to banish ''the worst memory
of my rugby career'' after having missed six penalties against the Irish
in Cardiff two years ago.
But the match is about more than just the Five Nations wooden spoon,
with the countries scheduled to meet again on June 4 in Johannesburg in
the group stages of the World Cup.
Ireland have had their injury problems in the run-up to the match, but
skipper and hooker Terry Kingston, leading his country for only the
second time, declared yesterday that his men are ready for the
challenge.
He said: ''I am not looking at it as the wooden-spoon decider -- more
a build-up for the World Cup.''
Wales -- M Back; I C Evans, captain, M R Hall, N G Davies, W T
Proctor; N R Jenkins, R N Jones; M Griffiths, G R Jenkins, S C John, P T
Davies, G O Llewellyn, A Gibbs, E W Lewis, R G Collins.
Ireland -- J Staples; R Wallace, B Mullin, P Danaher, S Geoghegan; E
Elwood, N Hogan; N Popplewell, T Kingston, captain, P Clohessy, G
Fulcher, D Tweed, A Foley, P Johns, E Halvey.

AFTER the havoc inflicted by the ferocious wind on the opening day of
the Portuguese Open Golf Championship a semblance of order was restored
in the second round yesterday.
Thankfully, more docile weather allowed the competitors to play shots
instead of merely holding on as best they could for survival.
Miguel Angel Jimenez, who resumed his interrupted first round on the
thirteenth tee one over par, made 14 birdies in 24 holes over Penha
Longa's precipitous 7000-yard course. Having tacked a 66 to his initial
68 for 134, 10 under par, Jimenez held a three-stroke lead over Italy's
first Ryder Cup player, Costantino Rocca.
But few players, if any, put the weather's improvement to better use
than four of the Scottish players. Most notably, Adam Hunter equalled
the Irishman Paul McGinley's 65 as the round's lowest score, an
improvement of eight strokes, to share third place with two Essex
professionals, Mark Davis and Paul Curry.
Gary Orr's 69 was nine strokes lower than his first effort and granted
him the chance to make the 36-hole cut when the qualifying figure is
determined this morning. And Paul Lawrie and Gordon Brand Jr had
respective scores of 67 and 68, for both of them an improvement of eight
strokes.
In halves of 33-32 Hunter had six birdies, including three in the last
four holes, two of them at short holes, but his most productive gain was
the eagle 3 at the 484-yard sixth where, down the diminished breeze, he
hit a No.5-iron shot to 18 inches -- the same club he hit to one foot
and 10 feet for the 2s near the end.
Lawrie, who last week consulted Richard Cox, the Edinburgh sports
psychologist who has been working with Scotland's rugby squad, made a
concerted effort not to get ahead of himself. The result was six
birdies, half of them at long holes, although, ironically, he
three-putted the other for par.
Brand put his resolute finish on Thursday to real purpose, especially
with his inward half of 33, three under. He made four successive birdies
from the twelfth, mostly the reward for the accuracy of his short and
medium iron shots. Orr succeeded in throwing himself a lifeline with
birdies at two of the last three holes.
Brian Barnes, who had to play 31 holes in his fiftieth year, took two
in a bunker to bogey the last and finish on the same total as Orr. But
Andrew Coltart, 10 over after three holes, withdrew with a stomach
upset. Stephen McAllister, seven over with six to play, also pulled out
to join Mike Miller and Ross Drummond, five and six over, on the
sidelines.
Jimenez's advantage would surely have been greater had he not hit two
wayward drives and bogeyed the sixteenth and eighteenth, confirmation
that even without the reinforcement of rough weather the course's own
defences were quite capable of punishing the misdirected shot.
The Spaniard, who missed his first three cuts this winter after a
lengthy rest, next month plays in his first US Masters tournament,
joining Colin Montgomerie and David Gilford as the only European
professionals not to have won the title. The advice of his two
compatriots who have won, Severiano Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal,
is: ''Stay calm.''
Like every other candidate who has not previously played in a Ryder
Cup team Jimenez insists on talking down his prospects, although he is
currently tenth on the points table. Rocca, by contrast, feels it is
important to retain his place, even if the impact on Italian sport
continues to be negligible.
Davis and Curry, both of whom have had experience of winning, were
round in 67 and 70 respectively -- not perhaps as spectacular as
McGinley's 65, which included six of the eight birdies he had in
covering 23 holes and an eagle 2 at the 354-yard thirteenth where, into
the light breeze, he holed a 135-yard No.8-iron shot.

BRITAIN'S Laura Davis shot a four-under-par 69 to share the lead with
five other players after the first round of the Standard Register-Ping
tournament in Phoenix, Arizona.
Defending champion Davies was joined by veteran Beth Daniel -- bidding
for a thirty-second title in 17 years -- along with 21-year-old amateur
Wendy Ward, Carolyn Hill, Lauri Merten and Tina Barrett. The 6483-yard
Moon Valley County Club is made for big-hitters like Daniel and Davies.
The latter's 280-yard average off the tee is the longest in the LPGA.
Davies had three birdies and a bogey on each nine. She bounced back
from the first bogey on the sixth hole by hitting a No.3-iron shot on to
the par-5 eighth and two-putting from 15 feet. She then made up for
bogeying the twelfth, where she two-putted from 12 feet, by sinking a
birdie putt from five feet on the next hole.
Davies said she was driving as well as ever, despite keeping a rein on
her instincts to go for all the par 5s in two. ''I know myself,'' said
Davies. ''I've just got to back off a little bit. I've been in plenty of
backyards and dog bowls on this course. I've been in swimming pools.''
* JOHNNIE Walker announced yesterday that they will withdraw as title
sponsors of the self-styled World championship after this year's event
has been played from December 14 to 18 at the Tryall Club, Jamaica. The
company will, however, continue to support the Johnnie Walker Classic in
Asia, the Ryder Cup match and other local events round the world.
The tournament, which will have been played five times, carries a
total prize fund of almost #1.6m. It has a field restricted to fewer
than 30 players, but has not always been supported by those who
qualified for it. Greg Norman and Nick Pryce have been absentees, and
Jose Maria Olazabal has never competed.

ROBINSON HOLLOWAY in Florida
THE chances of finishing the second round of the Nestle Invitational
dwindled to absolutely none the moment the first bolt of lightning
struck the Bay Hill section of Orlando.
When lightning suspended play yesterday afternoon in the middle of the
second round, the defending champion, Loren Roberts, had moved into the
lead, having dodged the bad weather to shoot a seven-under-par 65 and
reach 11 under par for the tournament.
Two strokes back was Davis Love III, making another attempt to win a
tournament and earn an invitation to the US Masters. Love, who has just
two more weeks to try if he does not win at Bay Hill, shot a 66,
birdieing the last three holes.
Former Scottish Open champion Jesper Parnevik was the highest placed
non-American in the tournament, his second-round 72 leaving him at five
under par, six strokes behind Roberts. Bernhard Langer was a stroke
further back at four under after a 69.
Ian Woosnam three-putted three times yesterday and shot a 74 that
brought him right to the cut line at one over par. Sandy Lyle ended his
round by two-putting from four feet to miss the cut by one stroke, his
71 leaving him at two over par.
Nick Faldo began yesterday by playing the first five holes in two over
par to drop to one over when he was called in by the lightning siren.
Colin Montgomerie was at even par for the tournament, one under par
through 14 holes, while the two Spaniards needed the post storm greens
to be truly soft and forgiving, with Jose Maria Olazabal at three over
par through four holes and Seve Ballesteros six over for the tournament
with six to play. Leading aggregates (American unless otherwise stated):
133 -- L Roberts 68, 65.
135 -- D Love III 69, 66.

EDITH Macarthur, dubbed the Queen Mum of Scottish Theatre, when asked
about her heroes and heroines, said: ''It is such a hard old world, I
like people who have charm, who have eased suffering, not caused it.
People who move one to thought, tears or laughter, especially
laughter.''
Who had she in mind for her hero? ''I have a list,'' she said in a
voice that brooked no dissent. ''It consists of Shakespeare, Burns,
William Wallace, Mozart, Stephen Sondheim, Arthur Miller, Placido
Domingo, and Alan Bennett, whose book, Writing Home, I am currently
reading.''
She also names the late Sam Wannamaker for his part in the Globe
reconstruction in London's Southwark.
''The Globe is so wonderful, you must go and see it -- I had never
been on that side of the river before -- It is a great concept, a
wonderful project, and, as you can see, my most recent enthusiasm.''
I asked about Shakespeare, because her career has not included a great
deal of his work. ''Like Burns, he is incomparable'' she said.
However she has personal heroes too. ''I think of a great friend, who
died three years ago, George Young, minister of St Bernard's
Stockbridge, as one of my heroes.
''His widow, May, would be among my heroines. She has had such a busy
life -- a job, two children, and a manse always open. She found time for
everyone and everything. Of course most people would say their heroine
was their mother, and I would too.''
Her other heroines? The list includes St Margaret of Scotland, the
Bronte sisters, Emmeline Pankhurst, and RL Stevenson's mother, Margaret.
She explained: ''If you look at the old photographs of the Stevensons,
surrounded by all those natives wearing sarongs in Samoa and there she
is, dressed like Queen Victoria, sitting in a stiff black dress with a
little white cap and her hair scraped back, hands folded in her lap.
Imagine her in all that heat . . . '' a true heroine!
For wit, she cites Jane Welsh Carlyle, wife of Thomas, whom she
discovered through a Tom Fleming stage play in which she recited Jane's
letters at the Edinburgh Festival 20 years ago.
Then there's a few contemporary actresses, from 95-year-old Evelyn
Lane -- ''She should be a dame'' -- to Dame Judi Dench. She also has a
passion for the character of Miss Jean Brodie, a part she has
understudied, but never played. She has just finished playing the
headmistress, Miss Mackay, in the West End opposite Patricia Hodge as
Brodie.
Macarthur declares: ''You know, I was in the original production of
Jean Brodie in 1966 at Wyndhams.
''I played a nun and I was Miss Brodie's understudy. Vanessa Redgrave
created the part, and when she left, it was taken over by Anna Massey,
and after a few months she left to make a film, and then it was
Elizabeth Sellars, the first Scottish actress to play her, and after her
Pauline Jamieson.''
She had hungered after the star role of Jean Brodie, but her leading
players then were never off and she never went on. ''That was a long
time ago when I was in my prime!''
What next? ''I haven't the faintest idea,'' she said. ''But if someone
had asked me that question this time last year, I would probably have
said the same thing.
''Something will turn up. It always does. I am going to stay down in
London for a couple of weeks. I have enjoyed the run -- so many old
friends have come to see me.''

Lady Claire Macdonald never ceases to be amazed that the bedraggled
sheep near her Skye home deliver such succulent meat.s
BEING originally from North Lancashire, I used to think the best lamb
in the world came from the fells -- until I married Godfrey and tasted
Scottish lamb. I'm sure that New Zealand lamb is as good as the Scottish
variety, when it's eaten in New Zealand, but here in Scotland there is
no doubt at all in my mind which is the best. And the appreciative
comments of our hotel guests bear witness to this, so it isn't just my
partiality!
The lamb legs we roast here for the guests are large -- they weigh
about 6lbs on average, and, therefore, are far from being early lamb,
which is what we shall be able to buy any time now in the shops. I feel
that meat and poultry -- I do not like baby poussin -- develop flavour
with maturity.
When I see the poor black-faced sheep that graze around Kinloch and
elsewhere struggling against torrential rain, it amazes me that such
utterly delicious meat comes from these animals.
But back to an altogether more cheerful aspect of lamb, which is on a
plate. Lamb is a sweet meat, particularly the meat from around the
shoulders and neck. Although we just serve roast legs of lamb to our
guests, there are a number of dishes to be made using less expensive
cuts.
One of the best and most underrated stews is Irish Stew, made from
neck of lamb. I like to add chunks of black pudding, onions, carrots,
and potatoes. Cooked long and slow, this is a most satisfying
combination of flavours. It has the added advantage of being that most
useful family dish -- a meal in one container. And, like all stews and
casseroles, it benefits greatly from being made, cooled, and reheated;
somehow the flavours all meld so much more than if the stew is eaten
after the first cooking.
Lamb goes very well with a number of ingredients -- rosemary is the
herb that springs immediately to mind -- and most vegetables, but
especially onions and leeks, tomatoes, mushrooms, many dried fruits such
as apricots and prunes. Lamb is also the best meat of all for cooking
with spices, and, therefore, for making into curries.
A dish that is hardly ever found in restaurants these days, although
rather more often found in homes, is boiled mutton with caper sauce. I
trim off as much fat as possible before simmering the meat in water with
vegetables packed around -- this gives good broth for soup. Capers are
usually so vinegary that I rinse them in a sieve under running water,
then pat them dry and soak them in milk for 20 minutes or so. T
This makes the creamy white sauce (with half mutton broth and half
full-fat milk) so much nicer. I add a grating of lemon rind, too -- I'm
not sure whether this is strictly accurate, but it doesn't matter,
really, because the taste is what counts.
Lamb chops are endlessly useful. They are not cheap, but worth buying.
With cutlets, which I think of as the ones that are long bone with a
disc of meat at the end, you are relying on a mound of vegetables to
make up the quantity and substance of the meal. The loin chops are the
larger amounts of meat with much less bone.
Be careful when you grill: the chops will toughen under such strong
direct heat -- have the grill about halfway on. If you snip -- with
scissors -- the fat around the edges it helps to prevent the meat from
curling up. On the occasions when I grill lamb chops I like to serve a
vegetable in a creamy white sauce as an accompaniment, with baked jacket
potatoes.
Leeks, onions, cauliflower, or cabbage (the last two in a white sauce
well seasoned with grated nutmeg) are all good in sauce. And herb
jellies, either rosemary and apple or thyme and apple, dress up the
grilled chops.
One of my most favourite lamb chop dishes is the grilled chops cooked
further in a tomato sauce, served with a puree of peas and mint -- not
only do the flavours go so well together, but it looks so attractive on
a plate.
LAMB CHOPS WITH BAKED POTATOES AND LEEKS
Serves 4
4 lamb chops
2 leeks, washed and trimmed, and sliced thinly
2 onions, skinned and sliced as thinly as possible
4-6 potatoes, depending on their size, peeled and thinly sliced
[1/2] pint dry cider
salt, freshly ground black pepper
5 fl oz double cream
Lightly oil an ovenproof dish. Mix together the sliced leeks and
onions, and put half on the bottom of the dish. Cover with a layer of
thinly sliced potatoes and put the chops on this. Cover with the rest of
the onions and leeks, and put the rest of the sliced potatoes on top.
Season with salt and pepper and pour over the cider -- you can
substitute stock if you wish -- and bake the dish in a moderate oven,
with a butter paper over the top of the potatoes, or a lighly oiled
piece of baking parchment. Cook in oven temperature 350[DEG]f,
180[DEG]c, gas mark 4 for one hour. Then take off the paper, pour the
cream over, and continue to cook for a further 10-15 minutes.

Leisure is now the preferred deity of many. Thousands flock to
cathedrals of consumerism or pursue relaxation with a vigour which
matches the rest of the week. Are we witnessing the end of the the day
on which it was ordained that we should rest? Or will Sunday survive in
another form? Leila Farrah considered the various uses pf the seventh
day. Here is her report.
AS Jean Rhys wrote: ''The feeling of Sunday is the same everywhere,
heavy, melancholy, standing still.'' The first day of the week until
1971, Sunday's restorative if soporific nutrient was balm to the
overloaded, but anathema to youth desperate to prolong the rise of
Saturday night.
And ''standing still'' is no longer relevant as we gamble,
shop-till-we-drop, and frantically pursue ''quality leisure'' on a day
traditionally dedicated to worship and family.
9.30am STRONG sunlight over the city and the Belmont Street
building-site pipes up threateningly for its morning performance,
Sabbath or no. Comatose drivers blink behind their sunguards and folk
scamper smiling down Byres Road in quest of Safeway and the Sunday
papers.
10.10am PATRICK Grant, Accident and Emergency consultant at the
Western is today ''feeling hellish'' from a cold, but not expecting a
repeat of Friday's hatchet-attack victims. Sunday casualties tend to be
the sports-injured, the elderly, mishap-prone children, and those with
worsening primary-care problems who missed a visit to their GPs on
Friday.
In the Accident and Emergency corridor, social worker Caroline smarts
from acute ear pain; a young girl wrings her hands in the aftermath of
an epileptic fit, and a large man is writhing from suspected
peritonitis. Off to X-ray is Julie who yesterday went over her
mountainbike's handlebars.
In the doctors' room, lengthy forms are filled in by Drs Murray, Orla
and Rachelle who'd rather be hillwalking, watching rugby, or doing up
the front bedroom. Nurse Frances starts the day feeling sorry for
herself ''until you see the other faces driving to work on the
motorway''. ''You can tell your readers that we're here from 8am until
8pm on Sunday,'' adds Carol.
In Resuscitation, a wailing Fiona regrets the eve's steaming Gay
Gordons and resulting fractured wrist now being reset with a dull crunch
after form-filling, deep needle-insertions, and cuffs to isolate
circulation from a huge syringe-load of local anaesthetic.
12.40pm THE ambulance on Hyndland Road is called to attend a suspected
miscarriage, as they drop me at One Devonshire Gardens, 1994 Hotel of
the Year and favourite watering-hole of Billy Connolly, Lulu, and Andrew
Neil.
In the navy and marbled drawing-room, five genteel ladies sip drinks
and pore over menus. Their conversation, too, is genteel and takes note
of Shelter thrift shops and ''dress shops in working-class areas''.
A young man attentively plumps off their imprints from tartan cushions
as they rise to #25-a-head lunch amid Renaissance tapestry wallpaper,
Stargazer lillies, ribbon-tied napkins, and an embarras of glasses and
cutlery.
Over crab and coriander timbale and shank of lamb, front-of-house
manager Claire lists celebrity guests and explains that not all classes
would find this setting a comfortable one to lunch in.
Whereas the Sunday joint remains a must for cannabis users, demand for
the meat variety has declined. ''I put it down to the emancipation of
women. The days are gone -- quite rightly -- when my mother would stay
in all day and prepare joint and vegetables,'' says Clydebank butcher,
farmer, and meat wholesaler Geoff Christie.
The pot of Sunday soup made with boiling beef eaten afterwards with
potatoes is also defunct as the consumers move away from fattier cheap
meat.
2.30pm THE Barras under sunburst skies with its 2500 full and
part-time workers, and teeming droves of shoppers. Throughout the 17
markets and 1000-odd stalls rises the universal sound of kids winding up
their parents. Everything seems luminous, fluffy baby bonnets, tomato
sauce on chips, silk bouquets, boudoir curtains, and fluffy snakes.
Tom Joyes and Stan Ridett, marketing manager and company secretary,
are in every weekend to oversee the running of the markets, aided by
burly workers and a state-of-the-art security camera system, installed
after the Icehouse stabbing last year.
In the spartan, Barras Barber Shop, Sidney and John still average 40
heads per Sunday after 27 years, although car-boot sales have taken away
business. ''Traditional dry cuts here, no unisex, that's a con.''
Started by her mother, Sally's stall has been going 47 years and is
spread with luminous Madonnas, candles, Italian prayer cards, crystal
rosaries. St Patrick's Day cards are shifting well, and at the stall
over the way little girls try on ornate communion dresses to a wall of
rapt mothers.
3.30pm TRONGATE is Saturday-thronged, with an invasive cacophony of
sales calls and 1970s disco straining from dodgy speakers. The Scotia
Bar jumps with the Blues Poets' Sunday residency, and serious Sunday
drinking. Up the way, Argos cashes in, the four-and-a-half hours'
trading equalling a full Monday's takings.
''Saturday shopping can be tremendously unpleasant,'' maintains Cliff
Percival at Marks &amp; Spencer. ''Sunday is for a family shop and we see
strong trade in young fashions, home furnishings, and menswear with
partners being able to give opinions about purchases.''
With Sunday trading an established part of the landscape as thousands
flock to supermarkets and other cathedrals of consumerism, what premiums
and incentives do employers offer to staff given the unsocial hours?
In formal company agreements, the Union of Shop, Distributive and
Allied Workers (Usdaw) continues to press and ensure that its members
who work on Sunday are paid double time. Existing employees can choose
whether or not to work the Sunday, but new recruits can have Sundays
scheduled automatically into their working week.
''Too many people chasing too few jobs means a drop in hourly rates
for those not represented by unions,'' says Pat McCormick of Usdaw,
which recently toured Job Centres, noting a drop in hourly rates since
the abolition of the Wages Council in 1993.
The Britain-wide Keep Sunday Special campaign was supported by Usdaw,
Care in Scotland, the Women's Guild, and the Church of Scotland, its
main concern the social aspect of Sunday trading with parents asked to
work on perhaps the only day they would otherwise spend with their
children.
The Scottish steering committee recently disbanded, explains Bob
Burnett, former retail co-ordinator for the campaign, ''because of a
Government hell-bent on creating what it sees as an open environment
which is really only so for the larger businesses like supermarkets. You
get a 'doughnut syndrome' with a ring of supermarkets outside the city
drawing business away from its centre''.
We should look also at the flipside of Sunday trading, says Morag
Gillespie of the Low Pay Unit, as the only possible time for mothers to
work to maximise income when partners can look after the children in the
absence of affordable childcare for low-wage workers.
3.30pm Trongate. Up the road, McDonald's is littered with bargain
hunters, children on overdrive, and parents tired and emotional. The
mood is everywhere. ''Why don't you run out in the middle of the road?''
snaps the bus driver, picking up five giggling girls. The Faifley bus
heaves with bulging carrier-bags and attached owners, their faces drawn
by the exertions of acquisitiveness.
A well-heeled guest and lady from One Devonshire are ''doing'' the
Kelvingrove along with an average of two or three hundred Sunday
visitors. A weekly dose of beauty this, with marbled seascapes, smoky
storms, shimmering Turner suns, and the poised serenity of Renaissance
virgins from ''The Art of the Church'' gallery where Veneto's St
Catherine Crowned resembles a Woodstock child. Rembrandt's Carcass of an
Ox almost slides off the canvas with its ridges of subcutaneous fat.
4.00pm EMOTIONAL traumas do not recede with deference to the day. The
hi-tech offices of Social Work Stand-By Services, Partick, handle
weekend crises and 80,000 referrals are processed every year, many from
fragmenting families.
From the last shift's case notes, today's workers are alerted to a
clinically depressed teenage girl, a schizophrenic causing anguish in
the home; a custody battle between separated parents, the husband
absconding with his four-year-old twins, and a 10-day-old baby needing a
daycare worker.
Jim, a 13-year-old, has fled from home where his father has assaulted
him. He intends to abscond to London but social worker Maggie persuades
him to wait with local police.
Inside Aitkenhead Police Station is a symphony of ringing phones. With
26-years' experience between them, Maggie and Audrey speak to Jim behind
closed doors, and drive him back to his mother on the South Side. He
threatens to walk if his father visits. ''Let's try and sort this out
permanently. Your dad is your dad and we've got to seek his views
although we might not agree with them,'' urges Maggie, who keeps an
emergency supply of safety orders in her car.
A few streets away in a council bedsit smelling of incontinence, an
89-year-old woman, Mrs Ross, has no immediate family nearby and is in
bed with crippling arthritis. She is suffering most of all from
loneliness. ''I'm away up the stairs and leave you with these nice
ladies,'' chirps her neighbour; Audrey holds the invalid's hand and
chats for 40 minutes.
''A Christian is a man who feels
Repentance on a Sunday for what he did on Saturday
And is going to do on Monday''
(Thomas Ybarra)
WITH Leisure now the preferred deity of many on Sunday, the ratings
war is on. Statistics for Church of Scotland worshippers shows a fall
from 1,133,515 in 1971 to 732,963 in 1993. Bishop of Motherwell Joseph
Devine, mentions that 270,000 church-goers in 1993 represented some 36%
of the 750,000 total Catholic population of Scotland.
Dr Geoffrey Scobie, social psychologist and Episcopal clergyman,
believes towering stress levels now have no chance of respite. ''The
advantage of Sunday was that it closed everything down, but its demise
means leisure activities like rock-climbing can be highly-stressed and
that freedom is being taken away from people who've been asked to work.
''The suggestion remains that people are still interested in the
non-materialistic side of life. Although society is secularised, people
are religious in a non-formal way as with cults and astrology.'' Or, as
French union activists once put it: ''The price to pay is very clear --
the enslavement of one half of the population to satisfy the consumer
demands of the other.''
''I speak only for our Church where there is a technical obligation to
attend which younger people don't experience,'' says Father Willy Slavin
of St Alphonsus RC Church, London Road, who says he finds an old-style
service gets a better response from his flock.
''The pattern of the Mass remains unchanged but the reason it's
survived for 2000 years is that everything else changes within it.''
5.45pm EVENING mass is full with many congregants Barras stallholders.
(St Alphonsus provides change for the marketeers.) Framed by filigree
spires and emerald-green dressed altar, Father Slavin expounds
passionately on the ''stupid habits that people have picked up through
affluence''. Lent is upon us.
Prayers for the unemployed and those exploited in their work are
punctuated by the gurglings of babies and toddlers.
In the manse kitchen Margaret savours the lentil soup and bemoans the
uncaring times. ''People used to have time on a Sunday, for themselves
and others. Not any more.''
Outside, frost gathers on the ground as refuse men sweep up the litter
mountains. Gallowgate echoes with raucous female pub singers, humming
power-lines, and the whine of low-flying planes.
6.20pm GAWPING at an indigo sky en route to the Cathedral, I fail to
anticipate the preferred Sunday entertainment of the youth looking down
at me from a High Street wall. With perfect aim, he hurls a glue-dipped
stone at my head. It finds my ear, sticks, and deafens me.
After an unscheduled visit to the Royal Infirmary evensong's poignancy
eludes me for all the towering vaults and angelic choral voices.
7.00pm ''SUNDAYS are all about chilling out,'' breathes Carina, joint
owner of vegan cafe The Bay Tree, Great Western Road, where I restore
self and Beano-style ear with an all-day breaky.
In Woodside Methodist Church's Gothic library, members of The Late
Late Service, a young Christian group, are gathering. Formed in 1991 by
Christians not finding worship meaningful in a traditional church
context, many are artists, musicians and songwriters.
Ponytails or shaved locks for the men seem de rigueur. There's the
monthly Celebration Service and Quiet Service using meditation and
drawing from Celtic Christianity in worship that's right-on for Jesus,
with discussion, dance music, and multimedia, although this is the
calmer Education Night.
''We see ourselves as post-modernist in reconstructing many different
sources from Greek Orthodox liturgy to rave graphics and using more
senses than the Church normally allows. We dance as we would in a
club,'' explains tonight's animateur, Andy Thornton. Sunday night is an
easier time for reflection than 11am, he holds; Saturday night and
Sunday morning are about going out and staying up late as both the
employed and unemployed have more pressure in their life and need a
release valve.
11.00pm AS punters emerge ashen from the final gory moments of Shallow
Grave, Odeon manager Neil Gemmell's 12-hour shift ends. This is
valuable, and recently challenged turf for the registered Big Issue
vendor... Steve, his face the image of a wet Sunday,''I've only sold
seven copies so I won't be staying in a B&amp;B tonight.'' His Sunday lunch?
A piece of fried chicken from a generous cinema-goer.
11.40pm WHILE my own Sunday closes with the ritual game of pool, Ruth
Robb of Net Trust goes on outreach to the prostitutes who work the East
End and whose seventh day is marked by a stinging awareness of their
chosen -- or unchosen -- profession.
''It brings home the fact that their children are in care or adopted.
Normally, they'd be putting their kids to bed and that's when they're
working. Sundays are a sad day for them.'' It's also the week's most
potentially dangerous time with clients tending not to be office workers
and fathers (many pick-up cars have baby seats) but single men addicted
to excessive sexual services.
1.OOam MONDAY morning stalks the psyche as the once cherished Sunday
slips into a homogeneous weekday pattern of work, obsessive consumerism
and determined leisure. So how was yours?

FEW footballers are able to take charge of their own destiny, but Jim
Bett has had a better try at it than most. If there is such a thing in
Scotland as a Europlayer, the man who was born in Hamilton 35 years ago
would just about fit the bill, and his regular flitting between
Scotland, Iceland, and Belgium has been almost entirely of his own
volition.
Bett is his own man, a player who decides where he plays, with whom he
plays, and how long he stays. It requires a singular strength of
character as well as an independent mind to carve out a career on those
terms, but it also helps if you can play a bit. No-one has ever accused
Bett of failings in that department.
He has played for Airdrie, Valur, Lokeren (twice), Rangers, Reykjavik,
Aberdeen, and now Hearts, none of whom would complain about his
contributions. Bett also won 25 caps for Scotland, but it was he who
determined when he would stop playing for his country, just as he has
done with each of his clubs.
Nor is it the case, as is perhaps perceived, that he took so much
umbrage at the publicity following a late night restauraunt incident in
Italy involving himself and Maurice Johnston during the World Cup in
1990 that he told Andy Roxburgh he was not interested any more.
In fact, much more typically, Bett told Roxburgh that he was fed up.
''You get to a point when you turn up and don't get a game that you feel
it is not worthwhile. Even when I did get on to the park, he played me
out on the left, where all I did was mark the other right back. It
didn't do much for me and both my club and I had told Andy that I didn't
like playing there.''
He had believed that he would have been the man to take over the role
in central midfield played by Graeme Souness . . . ''but Roxburgh had
his own men, and it soon became clear that I wouldn't get that
position.'' Eventually, in Italy, he reckoned he could live without the
hassle and, as is this man's style, decided enough was enough.
That individualistic approach has been prominent throughout a career
that began with Airdrie when he was 17, but took a bizarre switch to
Iceland after a few months. He had played for Airdrie Boys' Club in
Iceland when Valur asked him to come over, which he did, but lasted only
a couple of games before a scout from Lokeren, watching another player,
seized his chance to take the young Scot to Belgium.
''I was a bit homesick and it was a bit different for Scottish boy to
go abroad to play but it was a big challenge, and exciting, too. We had
a really good team, with a lot of internationalists. I learned a lot
playing with them.''
He was there for 18 months when John Greig, Rangers' manager at the
time, showed interest and, not for the last time in his career, Bett
made a big decision. He had been a Rangers supporter as a boy in
Hamilton, but confesses to being able to see them only a couple of
times. ''The Accies were nearer and I can remember going to see them
after school.''
Greig was, and remains a fan of the Bett way of playing, although when
he first appeared at Ibrox his Continental approach -- pass the ball
back rather than punt it upfield -- was a bit radical for some fans.
''Rangers were really a sleeping giant at that time,'' he recalls.
''They didn't spend much money on players and and the wages were not
great. We did win the League Cup and the Scottish Cup, but we were never
championship challengers. Graeme Souness and David Holmes changed all
that, but I was away by then.''
He was to get an offer to join that partnership in due course but,
after three years at Ibrox, Bett decided it was time to unhitch the
horse and mosey on down somewhere else.
''I had always kept in contact with Lokeren and when they asked me to
come back, I liked the idea. Three years with a club is quite a long
time.'' He spent two years in Belgium, where he could now speak Flemish
. . . ''It is not difficult to learn.''
When his time was up, Bett reckoned he should return to Scotland, and
when he surveyed the scene, he suspected Aberdeen would be the place to
go.
''They had been winning everything in Scotland and, if I was coming
back, I thought that would be the place to go.'' Rangers, under Jock
Wallace, asked him to return, as did a few English teams, but when the
Bett mind is made up, the job is done.
He stayed there until last year, but was tempted briefly to move again
to Rangers when Souness showed interest. However, he had grown to like
the Aberdeen life-style. Two Scottish triumphs and two Skol Cup
successes were highlights of his Pittodrie days, by the end of which he
was becoming a little disillusioned with the modus operandi in the
north.
''I felt the style of play had changed and in the premier league, some
of the games were just battlefields. At 34, I didn't think I needed that
and after nine years I was due a change. I had always wanted to go back
to Iceland anyway.'' His wife, Audur, is from that country and he has
made friends over there from frequent visits.
''I joined Reykjavik and it worked out well, because we won the cup,
the first time they had done it in 26 years.'' The Icelandic season,
perhaps not suprisingly, lasts from May to September, but he had to
return early for a cartilage operation in August, when Tommy McLean, now
manager of Hearts, invited him to sign on month-to-month.
Bett was to please yet another manager with his skills, and in due
course signed until the end of the season. He has enjoyed it, too, even
if it means being back in the hurly burly of the premier division. ''At
least Tommy tries to get us playing football,'' he says, ''and here we
are in the cup semi-final.''
If they get to that Hampden finale, Hearts will be comforted by the
fact that, in Bett, they have a man with as much, if not more,
experience of cup finals than anybody in the country. On his count he
reckons he has been in 12 finals during his career but that does not
mean he would not get as much kick out of making it one more time.
His arrangement with McLean allows him to stay in Aberdeen and train
''two or three times a week'' in Edinburgh. In a sense, he will be
completing a large circle when he plays against Airdrie. It was on April
23, 1977, that he played his first Scottish League game . . . for
Airdrie.
''They will give us a hard game,'' he said, ''but I am sure we will go
into it in the right way. Hampden is a big park and hopefully we will
get a bit of space to play.''
Would the final provide a fitting climax to the Bett career? ''I
haven't thought that far ahead, to be honest. When you get to 35, you
don't look too much in front of you.'' He is determined to keep playing
as long as he enjoys it, but does like the idea of one day in the future
to stay in the business, ''but somebody needs to ask you.''
He is not planning to go back to Iceland this summer, but has not made
any decisions about the future as yet. Whatever happens, this phlegmatic
character will not suffer any sleepless nights. His fun these days is
watching his three sons play the game.
Two of them, Baldur (14) and Callum (13) were born in Reykjavik, while
Brynjar (11) was born in Belgium. ''They have spent most of their lives
here, though, and feel Scottish.'' They are diplomatic, retaining their
backing of Aberdeen, but cheering on dad at Tynecastle on a few
occasions.
Unlike many other individualists on the park, Bett Sr remains very
much a singular character off it. It has not proved much of a handicap
so far.

With recent outbreaks of lynch law fresh in the public mind, Ian
Weddle examines its brutal and tragic history
TWO young women were recently jailed, one for setting fire to a child
molester and the other for slashing a wife beater. These recent cases
have revived public debate about the role of vigilante groups in modern
society.
However, it would be misleading to suggest that these cases represent
the beginning of some new communal backlash against liberal sentencing
policies by the courts, or the start of an underground vigilante
movement in the West of Scotland.
Such action has a long pedigree in Glasgow and not all of it
honourable.
It was in Glasgow in 1922, that the first of only two cases of
reported lynchings in the United Kingdom this century was recorded.
The case made legal history, and caused political and social uproar
throughout the UK, and also shocked most Glaswegians. For many, lynching
was seen as the preserve of Wild West outlaws or the Ku Klux Klan in the
Deep South of America, but certainly not something the people of the
East End of Glasgow would become embroiled in.
As recently as 1988, lynching was defined (by N P Warren in the
publication Justice of the Peace) as: ''The unlawful killing of a person
suspected of a crime, such that the suspicion provides the motive for
the offence.'' However, the word was derived from the exploits of one
Captain Charles Lynch (1736-1786) who presided over kangaroo courts in
Virginia.
Lynch sentenced those who appeared before him to whippings not death.
However the term lynching developed with American history, and in
particular the Civil War.
Before the Civil War, 300 people were hanged or burned by mobs in the
South. They were mainly anti-slavers and 90% were Europeans. Following
the Union victory in 1865, the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution was
passed abolishing slavery. After that almost 80% of all ''lynchings''
took place in the South where between 1882-1962 a total of 4736 people
were lynched -- three-quarters of whom were black.
In Britain, by contrast, lynching has always been very rare. But when
it does occur it seems to follow the ancient tradition of the hue and
cry: the hot pursuit of a criminal suspect by a crowd which forms
spontaneously. In the recent Glasgow case of the woman jailed for
setting fire to the child molester, eyewitnesses reported, according to
The Herald account of the case, that the woman went to the man's house
and: ''Before he could shut the door she threw petrol in his face. He
then heard a whooshing noise and saw his door and hall engulfed in
flames. When he tried to douse the fire with water, his petrol-soaked
hair and left hand were set alight. He tried to escape by breaking a
kitchen window, climbing out, and clinging to a drainpipe two floors
up.''
''There was a lot of ill-feeling in the neighbourhood and a hostile
crowd gathered below, shouting abuse''
(The Herald, October, 1994).
The Glasgow lynching of 1922, reflected, and indeed almost mirrored
the 1994 case so graphically highlighted by the media at the time. Both
cases involved the issue of sexual abuse towards children and mob
justice. However, there were two important difference between the cases,
apart from the 72 years that separated them.
The victim of the 1922 lynching was innocent, and unlike the 1994
child molester, did not survive the fury of the mob.
The story begins on the September 4, 1922, when 33-year-old Robert
Alexander Stewart, a ships' cook, disembarked at Ayr Harbour. Exactly a
week later he would be fatally injured, for no more obvious reason than
taking his ''honorary'' nephew for a ride on a tram car.
The nephew was five-year-old Alister Sinclair. Alister's mother had
died and he was looked after by the Stewart's sister-in-law. His father
lived with Stewart in Ibrox and they had been friends for several years.
On the fateful day that he was attacked, Stewart had taken the little
boy across the city to see his father.
The trouble started for Stewart once they got on the tram car. Almost
at once the conductor became suspicious of the pair, because the man was
respectably dressed, and the boy was clearly from a poor working-class
background, being bare-footed and shabbily dressed.
The conductor alerted a woman passenger -- a rather formidable, and
very large middle-aged woman, by the name of Mrs Reid. Mrs Reid sprang
to her feet and began bawling out ''kidnapper'' and ''pervert''. She
snatched the boy from his seat and dragged him away to the lower-deck.
The conductor was now convinced that Stewart was a child molester and
tried to prevent him from leaving the tram. However, when the tram
slowed down, Stewart managed to jump free.
Unfortunately for him, the conductor blew his whistle, and a voice
from the crowd yelled out ''kidnapper''. The shrill peep of the whistle,
and the hysterical Mrs Reid, signalled the death sentence for the
bemused and terrified Stewart who was then pursued by a gang of passing
youths.
The gang caught up and cornered Stewart in a close near to Dalmarnock
in the city's East End. They then proceeded to savagely beat and kick
him, and when he was near to death, they made a noose from a clothes
line and hanged him from a close gas-lamp. By the time the local police
constable arrived Stewart was unconscious and almost dead.
He was taken by horse-drawn ambulance to Glasgow Royal Infirmary,
where he died within a day. Medical evidence would later show that death
resulted from a massive head injury following multiple blows and
strangulation.
The Glasgow Police were initially ''messed about'' in their
investigations by the available witnesses. As the press at the time
reported, the police were ''groping in the dark''.
After a few days, however, they arrested two men -- James Stevenson
and Robert Caskie -- in connection with the ''outrage''. The two men
lived near the scene, and were at that time believed to have been the
leaders of the crowd. The men were duly charged with murder by assault,
a crime which carried the death penalty. They were brought before
magistrates at Glasgow Eastern Police Court, and remanded in custody to
appear before the High Court on December 29, 1922.
The two men were subsequently found not guilty by the trial judge,
Lord Alness, who stressed the lack of corroborative evidence against the
accused men. Following a retirement of only 15 minutes, the forewoman of
the jury announced a verdict of ''not proven'', and the prisoners were
released.
According to the court report, an unidentified woman had said the man
had kidnapped ''a wee kiddie'' and ''deserved a good kickin'''.
It was unfortunate for the victim that public paranoia about child
molestation was abnormally high in Glasgow in 1922, following a series
of kidnapping cases the previous year. The lynching also highlighted the
recurring role of women as the avenging angels of supposed male
sex-offenders.
The 1922 case should serve as a reminder of the indiscriminate
brutality of mob justice, and the personal and social costs of vigilante
retribution.

LIZ McColgan's well-documented exploits -- climaxed by a world
cross-country medal, world 10,000 metres title, and fastest debut
marathon, all within a year of the birth of her daughter -- earned her
the justified reputation as one of the iron women of world athletics.
Indeed, as the hype intensifies pending her comeback in London a
fortnight tomorrow, it may be tempting to conclude that she is the only
Scot of note at the distance.
The truth is that the women's marathon is Scotland's most successful
event at senior international level. The pre-selection of Karen Macleod
(Edinburgh AC) for the world championships in Gothenburg this summer was
topped this week when Trudi Thomson (Babcock-Thorn Pitreavie) and Alison
Rose (Edinburgh Woollen Mill) were included in the UK team which
contests the World Marathon Cup in Athens three weeks tomorrow.
Fifer Thomson, in particular, has a curriculum vitae which reveals a
will and drive rivalling that of McColgan, establishing her as an
equally inspirational figure.
For the 36-year-old did not take up the sport until after the birth of
her third daughter. A 20-a-day smoker, rheumatoid arthritis victim, and
bulimia sufferer, weighing 13st, she was unpromising material for an
athletics champion when she first began running in 1990.
Yet in less than five years, she has become a world force in
ultra-distance running. Eighth on her debut, helping Britain to silver
at the 1993 world 100 kilometre (62[1/2] miles) championships, she has
since improved dramatically.
Last year, she finished runner-up for the world 100k title, in Japan,
with a time of 7hr 42min.19sec., surpassing Leslie Watson's Scottish
record. When established, that had been the world best.
Thomson's enthusiasm for competition, particularly given her arthritis
problem, merits that tired adjective, amazing. Witness the following
extract from her racing diary last year:
March 5: Won, Cupar five-mile race; 13: Won, Inverness half-marathon
1-19-36; 20: Club five-mile handicap.
April 2: Fifth, Two Oceans 35-mile race, South Africa, 3-55-17; 17:
Eighteenth, London marathon 2-47-31. 24: Won, Lochaber marathon 2-52-12
(course record).
May 1: Won, St Andrews half-marathon 1-18-30 (course record); 4: Won,
Sri Chinmoy five miles; 7: Won, Edinburgh-North Berwick, 22 miles
(course record); 11: Won, Troon 10,000m; 14: Won, Penicuik 10,000m. 30:
Third, Inter-county 20 miles, 2-04-03.
''I race a lot, because I don't know how long I'll be able to keep
running,'' she says. ''I want to enjoy it while I can. I was really ill
with arthritis, triggered during the pregnancy of my first daughter,
Nikala, 12 years ago.
''I've suffered a lot of pain, but I think it's helped my running,
because I've developed a high-pain threshold. I was on anti-inflammatory
tablets for years. On wet days, I still suffer particularly badly. But a
change to a vegetarian diet, and lots of cod liver oil, iron, calcium,
and vitamin C, has helped a lot.
''I won't give up racing. I'd compete in a wheelchair if I had to.''
Yet arthritis has perhaps been the least of Trudi's problems. ''I
started smoking at 11, and was on 20-a-day from the age of 18,'' she
says. ''Once I started running, it took me four years to give up. It was
harder than the training.
''Worst of all, I was a bulimia sufferer. I was in misery for years. I
weighed 13st before. Now I am just over eight.'' The condition, a
pathological eating disorder, is sometimes linked to anorexia.
''I would wake and go for a run by 6am, before my husband woke, and
pretend I hadn't been out. Then I'd swim for a mile, and go straight to
a step aerobics class. I'd have another run in the afternoon, and
another step class. At night I climbed on the exercise bike, and would
pedal for an hour, doing my knitting.
''It was stupid when I think back, but I couldn't help myself. If your
physique doesn't fit the image of the endurance runner, people can make
very unthinking remarks, and trigger problems.''
Thomson has lost count of the marathons she has done ''perhaps 30,''
but has now eased off ultra training, concentrating on developing pace
with the help of former Scottish steeplechase record-holder, John
Linaker.
Both she and the 27-year-old Rose are looking for personal bests in
Athens. Rose has run just five marathons, but has lowered her best each
time, including last year's European championships in Helsinki, having
been called in at one week's notice.
Rose used to follow the carbohydrate-loading diet and routine of
taking on of copious quantities of water before races. ''But it didn't
suit me,'' said the Edinburgh physiotherapist. ''I had terrible cramp --
until Helsinki. I stopped the diet, and though not properly prepared,
felt better than ever before. I hope this time, having had good
preparation, I can go even faster.''
A place in the Europeans was only partial consolation for missing the
Commonwealth Games. Rose, fifth in the World Student Games marathon, and
her coach, believed she had done enough to qualify for the 10,000 metres
in Victoria. But by holding a place open for McColgan to defend her
title, Rose was ruled out. ''There were tears at the time, but I'm not
bitter,'' she says.
* THE Scottish Athletics Yearbook, published this week, reveals
encouraging signs of recovery, particularly in the younger age groups.
Outdoors last season, six senior women set nine native and national
records and six senior men did likewise. There were 22 junior records.
There have been 42 Scottish records indoors this winter -- eight of
them by Melanie Neef, who was denied two further marks, at 200m, because
there were only two people in the race.
The 224-page yearbook, the most comprehensive produced by the Scottish
Association of Track Statisticians, will be available at meetings this
year. It can be obtained by post from Colin Shields, 21 Bogton Av,
Glasgow G44 3JJ (#4, including post and package).

DESPITE the withdrawal of backing from Edinburgh District Council, the
Great Britain v USA athletics international will go ahead, even if not
at Meadowbank.
The July 27 meeting, as revealed yesterday in The Herald, has lost
#50,000 of capital support, but the British Athletic Federation insist
it will take place somewhere.
''We are contractually obliged to provide six televised meetings, and
as this was one of them, it will take place in some form,'' said BAF
spokesman Tony Ward yesterday. ''It is most unlikely to be Edinburgh. We
are now considering alternatives including Gateshead, Sheffield, and
Birmingham.''
Switching the event would further damage credibility of athletics in
Scotland. It is the third televised event -- after the Princes Street
Mile and Aberdeen international road series -- to be axed in recent
months. In addition, July's Scotland v Israel, Turkey, Wales, and
Northern Ireland track match has been moved to Wales. A #50,000
shortfall in Scots funds forced budget slashing.
Glasgow, with no facility capable of hosting international athletics,
this week approved a #1m application to the National Lottery for funding
an all-weather track at Scotstoun. Upgrading of Grangemouth, extending
Britain's first all-weather track (in 1966) from six lanes to eight, is
scheduled for later this year.
* THE third-placed boys' team in the Glasgow Primary Schools
cross-country championships on Thursday was St Brigid's, Toryglen.

SCOTLAND wrapped up one of their best performances in the home
international indoor championship when they crushed England 131-89 in
Nottingham yesterday, giving them the title for the fifth successive
year.
England opened up an early 18-shot lead. The Scots hit back, and by
the close of the tenth end, had edged 53-49 in front.
Over the next five ends, they counted 49 shots for the loss of just 10
to take a 102-59 lead, and they protected their advantage to finish
42-shot winners.
Showing the way for the Scots was Commonwealth gold medallist Richard
Corsie, who counted 24 shots for the loss of just one from the sixth end
to beat world outdoor champion Tony Allcock 29-7.
Prestwick's Robert McCulloch added a 21-14 win over world indoor
singles title holder Andy Thomson, team captain Angus Blair beat Wynne
Richards 28-19, Alex Marshall beat Gary Smith 21-15, and Willie Wood
just held on to beat John Bell 17-16.
England's consolation win came from David Ward who beat Robert Provan
18-15.
Ireland were left with the wooden spoon when they were edged out
109-111 by Wales.

SCOTLAND'S national team embark on a month of tough racing this week,
a period for which many have been aiming to peak to stake their claim to
a British Alpine team place for next season.
The KPMG Scottish A Squad skiers -- the full-time athletes based in
the French Alps near Les Arcs and Tignes -- have a short circuit of
European FIS (International Ski Federation) races in which to compete
before the British Land British National Ski Championships begin in
Tignes next weekend.
For the first time, the national championships are followed the next
week by The British Land British Junior and Children's Championships in
the same resort. They return to Scotland for the Scottish Seniors FIS
Championships at Nevis Range by Fort William.
With a new coach this season in Canadian Chuck Auclair, their new
Alpine base, and a demanding training regime to introduce a new chapter
of technique developments, it has been something of a learning season
which has produced some excellent results already.
Scottish national coach John Clark said yesterday, on the eve of his
departure for France: ''Several Scottish skiers, I feel, should have
already done enough to merit a place on the British FIS team and we'll
be telling them just to go to the National Championships, ski flat out,
and, at their best, they should be able to beat some current British
team skiers.''
Glasgow's Kirsteen McGibbon, 19, has recently been training alongside
the Hanson and Robertson British Women's FIS team and underlined her
peaking form by winning an FIS Giant Slalom last week. Aberdeen's Tessa
Pirie, 16, has made excellent progress this season. and has skied to
similar ranking results to British team girls.
Clark believes Pirie has the ability to cause a few upsets to the top
British team seeds in the Junior (under-19) Championships.
Of the Scottish men, 17-year-old Michal Pilarski, from Falkirk, is
another who has already beaten marks set by British team skiers of his
age this season. He is in Norway this week after having been selected
for the World Junior Championships and is tipped as a title contender in
the British Junior Championships.
Edinburgh's Ross Baxter, 16, won the East of Scotland FIS
Championships making good world-ranking points.
''At the end of the day we have some excellent young talent and a
set-up which we've now proved can produce results and is as good as the
British team have,'' added Clark.

A TIE between Thorniewood United and Forth Wanderers scheduled for
today has been stopped following court action in the past couple of
days.
The dispute involves Shotts Bon Accord and the Central Region Junior
FA, who fined the club #500 and disqualified them from the MBM Cup for
having failed to play Thorniewood in a second-round tie.
Bon Accord declined to play on the grounds that eight of their players
were suffering from flu, and medical certificates were submitted. But
the Central FA challenged the validity of the certificates.
On Thursday, Court of Session judge Lord Cullen granted the club an
interim interdict against the Association, preventing Thorniewood's tie
in the next round from going ahead. The Association yesterday were
refused a recall of the interim interdict.
Frank McGarvey, assistant to Shotts manager John Clark, said last
night: ''We're just looking for justice to be done.''

CHELTENHAM closed its doors yesterday for the season after an
exhilarating week, but although Norman Williamson and Kim Bailey proved
the men to follow with success in the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup at
the Festival, owner Graham Roach also enjoyed himself.
He landed his second big prize in the space of 48 hours when
heavily-backed Bear Claw took yesterday's feature race. The gelding's
short-head success in the sponsored novices hurdle final topped up
celebrations for the Cornish food manufacturer after Viking Flagship's
success in the Queen Mother Champion Chase.
Bear Claw was backed down to 3-1 favourite from 7-1 -- despite facing
24 rivals -- and justified the confidence with the help of a superb ride
from Jamie Osborne.
Approaching the last the race had developed into a straight fight
between Treasure Again and Bear Claw. Treasure Again held a slight
advantage half way up the run-in, but Osborne really got going and Bear
Claw stuck his neck out to get up on the line.
''He should make a cracking chaser,'' said trainer Oliver Sherwood,
''and I'd like to think we'll be back for the Sun Alliance Chase.''
Trainer Kevin Bishop landed the biggest success of his 16-year career
when Hill Trix hit the jackpot in the Pure Genius Chase. The son of Le
Moss stayed on up the run-in for Anthony Tory to beat Flashthecash, who
did himself no favours when clouting the last fence in the lead.
Yesterday's day was so successful -- attracting a crown of 16,835 --
that a proposal to establish an official four-day Cheltenham Festival in
1996 is to be considered.
* THE Midlands National may not compare with the real thing at
Aintree, but the going can make it a major test of stamina, writes Robin
Cook.
Riverside Boy has plenty of stamina and has turned in two fine
performances this season, runner-up in the Greenalls Gold Cup and the
Anthony Mildmay. With those races in mind Martin Pipe's veteran has
sound credentials, but he has not won for more than a year and is long
past the average age of recent winners in this event.
It may pay to oppose him with Arthur's Minstrel, who looked as if he
might have collared Willsford before for falling at Newcastle. In his
two previous races he battled on in close finishes, just getting the
edge at Sandown over Clyde Ranger who had Mr Boston seven lengths
adrift.
There may be each-way value in The Committee, fourth in the Grand
National that never started.
Toogood To Be True has run into placings in decent company, including
third place behind Morceli in the Dipper Chase, and the Ladbroke Chase
offers more modest competition.
Beauchamp Grace offers a form line on most of her rivals in the mares'
chase. On that showing Grey Power comes out on top. Mary Reveley's entry
had more in hand than the winning margin would suggest, and has since
shown steady improvement. However, Irish raider Storm Front may prove
better than the local talent and can defy top weight to add to an
impressive hat trick of wins in the mud.
Strath Royal was unlucky recently at Doncaster. He was well clear and
had the race sewn up before the second last fence got in the way. His
opportunity to make amends comes today in the Arthur Stephenson Chase at
Newcastle.
* THE point-to-point meeting scheduled for Lanark this afternoon has
been postponed due to adverse weather conditions. It is hoped that the
card will go ahead in two weeks.

DESPITE travelling with defective steering and brakes for nearly 100
miles over some of the world's most inhospitable terrain, Scotland's
David Milne has not lost his taste for sled-dog racing.
Scotland's first entrant in the Alaskan sled-dog race, the Iditarod,
mushed his huskie team into the Bering Sea town of Nome in twenty-third
place late on Thursday night.
''At one point, I had to chop down a tree to make repairs to my
sled,'' said Milne yesterday. ''I'd to run with damaging steering, and
no brakes, coming down near-vertical mountain slopes, and through rocks,
ice, snow and raging rivers. It was not so much exhilarating as
terrifying.''
He was third rookie to finish from the line-up of 58 teams which
started the 1150-mile test of endurance, and even yet, many teams are
littered down the Arctic wasteland trail, back toward Anchorage.
An administrative hiccup at one of the later check points cost Milne
several hours, and the chance of a top-20 place which would have brought
him a minimum of $6500.
The 32-year-old Dundonian finished in 11 days, 8hr, 7min, 34sec, a
time which has won many previous races. ''When I arrived in Unalakleet,
there was nobody to direct me to the straw for my dogs, and it took me
hours to bed them down,'' he said yesterday.
The total cost of Milne's bid has been in excess of $20,000, but
because of sponsorships, and being employed by former five-time winner
Rick Swenson, it has cost the Dundonian accountant not much more than
$2000.
He finished with nine animals of the 16 with which he started, the
others having been dropped off as they became sick or tired. ''But they
are all OK now,'' said Milne.

Familiarity breeds a delightful contentment for Kenneth Wright who
finds himself quite at home when he goes off in search of the crack in
dear old dirty Dublin
NO city with any image to talk about is really like its image, like
its history, like anything you've read about it -- including this thing
-- but some are closer than others. As with a veteran showbiz act on a
comeback tour, pestered to do the old familiar routines -- some will
oblige with good grace, some will oblige resentfully, and some will tell
the audience to naff off and buy the video -- great cities have
different attitudes to the obligation of living up to themselves.
London hates its audience; London is a neurotic old has-been queen
prowling the theatre for an unattended door through which to do a runner
with the night's takings. It's been your privilege just to share the
same building with her, whistling fretfully in the stalls while she dips
her face in a bag of drugs backstage. Thanks for the money, suckers;
goodnight. Paris is still game enough to put on a show, if a little
haughtily; an ageing vedette embarrassed by the vulgarity of her
admirers but true to the principle that the show must go on, proud that
after all these years she can still attract a full house. Quaint and
cuddly Amsterdam is an ancient ingenue, a perpetual debutante: she can't
quite believe that she's famous and certainly doesn't have a clue what
for, and she'd be shocked to the seat of her little white bicycle if you
told her.
But Dublin . . . dear old dirty Dublin, as Brendan Behan was wont to
apostrophise her, is still the gamest old trouper ever to tread the
boards of tourism. A lot of water has flowed under the Ha'penny Bridge
since she made her name, and she knows the numbers so well she can do
them in her sleep -- and usually does -- but she isn't too proud to get
out there and shake a leg, even if it must occur to her now and again to
wonder how the old routine still draws them in. But then she likes the
old routine herself: the pubs, the history, the literature, the
promiscuous fondness for offhand conversation that Dubliners and
Glaswegians call the crack. She'd still be doing it for her own
amusement if nobody came to watch.
McDaid's in Harry Street (off Grafton Street), an old literary boozer
unspoiled by progress and nowadays popular with students and the young
team in general, is one of the countless places where the show goes on;
I made it my base of operations, it being handily situated for the
hotel. Energetic and pleasant young barkeeps distribute pints of
Guinness (yes, it does taste better over there) and general conversation
with equal readiness, but most appealing about them is their willingness
to collude in every tourist's fondest illusion, the fantasy that you
didn't just walk in at random with an enormous neon sign over your head
reading I Am A Tourist. This consists of refraining from the deadly
questions Are you over here for long? and Where is it in England that
you come from? This discretion implicitly accords an
honorary-Dublinerhood that is soothing to the traveller who hopes, if
not to conceal his status, then at least not to be reminded of it too
forcefully.
This, I think, is what I like best about Dubliners: they don't
practise tourist apartheid. In no other European city I know is there
such a feeling of being allowed to blend in; almost the only people who
will manifest a consciousness of your position are the city's
distressingly plentiful beggars, mostly children -- many in their
Confirmation or First Communion outfits, for added pathos -- who can
spot a rubberneck at 100 yards. (It is not easy to refuse a 10-year-old
girl who promises to remember you in her prayers. I need all the prayers
I can get.)
As for literature and the arts, Dublin wears its learning lightly.
Pubs named for allusions to James Joyce, Flann O'Brien, or Brendan Behan
are encouragingly few; the attitude of Dubliners generally is that sure,
we knew their fathers. Typical is the nickname of the fountain in
O'Connell Street, depicting Joyce's Anna Livia, the feminine spirit of
the Liffey that flows through Finnegans Wake, sitting in what looks
terribly like an avant-garde bathtub: Dubliners call it the Floozie in
the Jacuzzi.
History is everywhere in Dublin, handled with the casual familiarity
of a city that has no shortage of it. A Tourist Board booklet details 16
easy walks around places of interest, and it is my shame and sorrow that
I never used it more than for a visit to Trinity College to see the Book
of Kells, and a stroll to the Post Office to read the 1916 declaration
of the Easter Rising and inspect the British Army's bullet-holes in the
wall. But I only had four days in Dublin, and it has a lot of fine pubs,
full of the crack, that needed exploring more urgently.
There was Mulligan's, where I went looking for Dublin's most renowned
newspaper columnist, Con Houlihan of the Irish Press, directed there by
the man who cut my hair at the Trinity Street barbershop. ''You'll know
him easy . . . Con went to the States for three weeks for the World Cup
and never took off his anorak while he was there.'' He wasn't in
Mulligan's that night, but his anorak was behind the bar.
There was the Palace Bar, another old newsmen's hangout and scene of
the brilliant Flann O'Brien's ferocious, poisonous drunk jags; there was
the Brazen Head down by the quays, a claimant to the title of Dublin's
oldest pub and one of the many bars through which J P Donleavy followed
Gainor Crist, the original Ginger Man of the rowdiest and roughest of
Dublin's rowdy novels.
And then there was the Ormond Hotel, also down by the quays, that has
a plaque on the wall that proudly claims the honour of having been the
scene of one of the more disreputable episodes of Joyce's Ulysses; it
isn't every hotel you'd find so willing to proclaim its earlier life as
a house of ill repute.
It was a long Sunday afternoon in the lounge and a folk group was
giving it lashings, kicking off with innocuous items like The Irish
Rover and Danny Boy, but as the afternoon wore on -- never forget that
Ireland is a foreign country, and one that won its independence through
violent resistance -- sliding into Republican ballads like The Wearing
Of The Green, Four Green Fields, Sean South, and The Men Behind The
Wire.
At the bar I got talking to a young son of Erin who had got to Dublin
from County Meath via the building sites of London. ''D'ye support the
IRA?'' he asked me. Cute as a Christian, I told him I was all for peace
in Northern Ireland, and, at the heel of the hunt and with common
consent, for a 32-county united Ireland. ''Good man yourself,'' he said.
''You'll have a pint, and whatever your wife is having. You poor
Scottish fellas don't even have the sea to separate you from England.''
The afternoon wore on.
In all of these places I enjoyed the comfort of strangers and rarely
felt much of a stranger myself. But it must be an Irishism made flesh to
have to report that the place where the crack flowed most freely was in
a tiny jazz cellar in Anne Street South (off Grafton Street), and from
the mostly French-speaking Algerian proprietor at that. La Cave is a
find that has to be passed on: a narrow room with a bar, six or seven
tables -- one of which is removed at night to make room for the band --
and a menu that offers a startlingly good lunch or dinner for eight or
nine quid.
Late on Saturday night, the joint was jumping with about 200 young
Dubliners of all styles and cultures, and getting to the lavatory
necessitated a degree of intimate contact with most of them. Latecomers
took a refreshment on the stairs, while in the corner two guitarists and
a drummer stepped lightly through sprightly improvisations on
traditional Irish comeallyez like Take Five and I've Grown Accustomed to
her Face. Krimo (the owner) and I drank Cuban rum till the small hours
and talked about Dublin and enjoyed the heat and the cool of the place,
the two of us honorary Dubliners both.

LET's say you are the human resources manager of an Insider 500
company. It is a successful business hungry for young management talent.
And you're worried -- worried about where that talent will come from in
the future.
Suddenly you have begun to notice that today's top graduates, the MBAs
and other early-to-mid-20s ambitious types, are not so convinced they
want a career with your business.
Sure, if you set out your stall at a university careers day or a jobs
fair, there is the usual crush of the unemployed and the unemployable.
But hardly any people show up now of a calibre and a competence that
would have you reaching for an engagement form.
You've also noticed that when you do get a bright youngster in for an
interview, more often than not the cheeky so-and-so is interviewing you.
They ask questions that make it clear they are wondering whether working
for your company will fit in with their desired lifestyle, and whether,
in fact, they risk having to subjugate their lives to a corporate agenda
that involves perpetual travel and ridiculous hours.
''Goodness me,'' you say to yourself. ''What on earth is going on out
there? Don't people know that unemployment will continue rising for the
foreseeable future, and that there is little prospect of the jobs
business becoming anything other than a buyer's market?''
Well, yes, they do. But there is a little more to this issue than
first greets the eye. The first -- and rather obvious -- conclusion is
that working for a large company is no longer the magnet it was until
quite recently. That is due to a combination of sociological and
economic reasons.
Five years of down-sizing and re-engineering have led to an unhealthy,
unhappy employment scenario with more pressure being piled on fewer
people. As I suggested here a couple of weeks ago, this situation
combines with rampant job insecurity to make some people -- particularly
those bright souls who expect to have a degree of control over their
lives -- cautious about committing to such organisations.
The second reason is that increasingly those same achievers are aware
there is another side to business. If they are good enough to hold down
fast-track jobs in aggressively run large companies, they are probably
good enough to start and build their own businesses.
If this works they will have more job security than the most
paternalistic company could ever offer -- and if it doesn't they will
probably still be able to land a good job.
A third reason is the continuing pull of professional careers. There
is a new trend for people with good track records in law or accountancy
firms, investment banks and consultancies to switch to top jobs in
business and industry.
Recently in Scotland we have seen Ian Adam, senior partner of big six
accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, move to the FD's desk at Christian
Salvesen, Ian Bankier, former high-flying corporate lawyer with McGrigor
Donald, become chief executive of whisky producer Burn Stewart, and
Touche Ross insolvency partner Fred Goodwin appointed deputy chief
executive of the Clydesdale Bank.
It is instructive to look at the situation in the US where business
trends generally anticipate those here. It is no secret many Fortune 500
companies have lost their lustre as places to work.
A recent survey showed that just 1% of 1000 adults questioned would
freely choose to be corporate managers. Most preferred either a career
offering more independence, such as medicine or law, or to start their
own businesses.
This trend is particularly marked among graduates of the top US
business schools. For example, less than half the class of '94 of
Stanford Business School opted for jobs in companies employing more than
1000 people, compared with almost 70% four years previously. Some
manufacturing companies no longer bother to attend university recruiting
sessions because of the poor response.
Given that most companies, even the larger ones, now recognise that
their futures depend entirely on the quality of their people, isn't this
serious? Some do recognise that it is and have responded by playing the
game to its new rules and out-sourcing consultants and other
independently employed people to fill key jobs on a project basis.
However, over here I suspect that only a very small minority of large
companies have sized up this looming issue and are prepared for it. I
don't give too much for the long-term prospects of the rest.

By A Correspondent
THE National Farmers' Union of England and Wales appears to be moving
closer towards accepting the idea that farm aid schemes should be
de-coupled from production. Such a move would fix their position closer
to the Scottish landowners' Federation viewpoint than the Scottish NFU.
The English NFU's latest thinking on this front was revealed during
discussion of their Real Choices publication -- aimed at setting out
options for the industry in the face of world trading changes and an
expanding European Union -- at a meeting of their council in London.
The draft spells out and expands on the original conclusion that
farmers face two stark choices in the future: tighter input quota
controls such as land set-aside, or decoupling subsidies from
production. Under GATT rules there is a nine-year ''peace clause'' on
decoupled or production neutral subsidies.
It concludes: ''Decoupled payments could provide an opportunity for
the development and support of innovative environmentally sensitive
farming practices which would not be possible under a regulatory regime
alone.''
But it adds there could be problems for certain areas of Britain and
some branches of farming -- notably livestock production in the less
favoured areas -- through sticking to this route alone. Nevertheless it
believes the conclusions should find majority support among other
European farmers unions.
Union President Sir David Naish made it clear the union was not saying
that quotas should be swept away. They had short-term advantages for the
industry and particularly for those who held them. But they also created
major problems and farmers should be aware of the implications for their
businesses if they were wound up.
The draft document, entitled ''Taking Real Choices Forward,'' rejects
the notion of repatriation or nationalisation of the common agicultural
policy and cites the distortions to trade already caused by some
national aid projects such as the illegal French aid to pig farmers.
There has been no final approval of the new document. It will be
discussed at area and branch level and subject to a final decision at
the union's June meeting.
Sir David also made it clear the union remained firmly committed to
the full resumption of the lawful trade in live animal exports.
''We have succeeded in our attempt to press the European Commission to
bring forward its planned investigation into alternative, welfare
friendly veal rearing systems'' he said. At the same time, a working
group under former union president Sir Simon Gourlay was conducting an
in-depth probe into animal welfare conditions on both sides of the farm
gate. This was also expected to be completed in time for the June
council.

YOU are unlikely to have seen many investors recently rubbing their
hands with joy over how well their shareholdings in France have been
doing. Measured by the index of leading shares, the Paris market is
bobbing along at not much above the lowest levels of the past year or
so. There are, however, glimmerings of interest now being shown in
French shares although the approach of the May elections does inject an
element of uncertainty.
UK broker Smith New Court, for instance, says: ''The French economy is
undoubtedly picking up.'' It predicts growth of 3% in gross domestic
product this year followed by 2.8% next year. And it feels sentiment
could be boosted by greater certainty over future economic policy once
the elections are out of the way.
Recovery, a word to make investors' ears prick up, may, therefore, be
in the air.
Although French property has suffered heavily in the recession, Smith
New Court now feels this could be a good time to pick up shares in
French Property Trust, an investment trust managed by Clan Asset
Management. Analyst Charles Cade, writing with the share price at 69p,
comments that the discount is almost 17%, adding: ''We believe that the
trust is now an attractive bet on a re-rating of French property shares.
Predicting the timing of this recovery is difficult but there appears to
be relatively little downside.''
The trust was launched in April 1990 to specialise in the shares of
French property companies. Unfortunately, that was just in time to catch
the Kuwait invasion, a sharp rise in interest rates and the deepest
recession the French property market has seen since the Second World
War. Since the market peaked in 1990/91 real estate values in Paris have
halved and rents have fallen by 40% to 50%.
With all that going on, the trust has not done too badly with a net
asset value of 82.8p a share, a drop of 23% in the past year.
There is plenty of bad news around still. Smith New Court admits:
''The French property market remains in deep recession with huge
over-capacity of office space.'' There are, in fact, some five million
square metres of office space vacant in Paris, which is five times the
level of new demand. That is due to a spate of building between 1988 and
1990 when the banks were willing to lend to developers holding out the
prospect of high margins.
The main buyers of commercial property in France are insurance
companies, banks and private investors but all are ''heavily overweight
in the sector'', the broker says. The banks last year started writing
down the value of their property holdings by around 50%. This may not be
enough and the chances are that there are more write-downs to come, but
these are not expected to be on the same scale.
Then, of course, there are interest rates. French rates could be
increased from their already high level if the Bundesbank tightens its
monetary policy. Looking at this scenario it is easy to see why the
broker comments: ''Sentiment is still extremely bearish.''
It's enough to make an investor lock up his or her cheque book. But
what about that word recovery. The broker says: ''There are signs that
the French commercial property market is close to the bottom.'' It
maintains ''substantial upside exists even with static property
prices''.
Looking at central Paris, it says that vacancy rates have reached a
plateau and there is some evidence that rental levels are stabilising
for good quality properties. Admitting that statistics in this sort of
market are not always reliable, it believes that ''if the market is not
at the bottom then it is extremely close to it''.
In central Paris it may take 12 to 15 months before there are
widespread rent increases and the glut of offices in the suburbs is
likely to take years to clear. On the supply side there have been no
major new projects started in France for more than two years without a
pre-let or forward sale agreement.
There is also a possibility of the Government offering subsidies of
around Ffr1000 per square metre to convert vacant offices into flats.
''There is still a shortage of residential accommodation in central
Paris and a significant amount of lower quality office space could be
taken off the market'' if this happens.
It is every investor's ambition to buy at the bottom. Could we be near
that point with this trust? Over to Mr Cade who comments: ''Sentiment is
so bearish that some people cannot ever envisage a recovery in the
Parisian commercial property sector. We believe that this is a sign that
it may now be the right time to invest in French property shares, since
all the bad news is already factored into their price.
''What is certain is that the shares of property companies will rise
well in advance of any recovery in property prices.''
The trust has 23 holdings. Nearly 40% of these are in companies with
high-quality properties, many of them in the prestigious area around the

Working out asset values of property companies is seldom an exact
science. But the broker says many French property companies are now on
large discounts which can range up to 50% or more. It argues that these
discounts offer ''considerable scope for an increase in share prices
even with stagnant property prices''.
Looking at the trust itself, it says that although the net asset value
based on share prices is roughly 83p a share, the estimated net claim on
the underlying assets of the property companies is around 115p to 120p.
That indicates what sort of potential could be there.

FARM WORKERS, aware of the 31% increase in farm incomes reported last
month, are preparing a substantial pay claim for submission to the
Agricultural Wages Board in a few weeks time.
Mr Hugh Wilson, agricultural officer of the Transport and General
Workers' Union will negotiate the claim. He said yesterday ''Farmers
have had an exceptionally good year. It has been said they are awash
with money.''
The farmworkers' eventual aim is to close the gap between their
existing wage level and the average wage for production workers in
industry. The production workers current average is #303 a week compared
to #145.10p for a general farm worker.
Mr Wilson said that the union would argue that after a period of
rising farm incomes it was time to award employees a substantial
increase. ''One of the better rates is for shepherds -- a very skilled
job -- and that is #187.90p,'' he said.
He acknowledged that some farmers paid '' a bit more'' but insisted
that there was a lot of leeway to be made up.
The union will also be pressing for casual workers to be paid at the
same minumum rates as permanent employees. ''The current hourly rate for
casuals, who could be involved in strenuous physical work all day, is
#2.79p, he said. ''The cleaning lady in the local school will get
#3.51p, and that is not a good rate.''
On holiday entitlement the farmworkers will be seeking an increase
from 20 days to 25 days.
The demand will also include a call for double-time payments when
public holidays are worked and a five-hour reduction in the current
45-hour working week.

A FRENCH satellite firm has shown European Union farm ministers how
cameras in space can crack down on subsidy swindles costing millions.
Spy-in-the-sky satellites help an army of EU farm inspectors check for
fraud in the set-aside scheme that rewards farmers for leaving 12-15% of
their land idle -- and their use is being extended, Toulouse operators
said.
The firm's computers can blow up a jumble of meaningless blotches into
a picture of a single farm, showing tell-tale crops as thin black
stripes.
Set-aside discrepancies are just one part of the EU's farm fraud
problem, which costs Brussels billions of pounds a year. Checking
returns is one of the biggest administrative headaches.
Ironically, France is one of the countries using high technology the
least. Europe's biggest farm producer tracked only three sites by
satellite in 1994, while Italy, long accused of being lax on fraud,
monitored 10.

The Stirling Stone Group's whole history could be squeezed into a few
grains of time, compared with the antiquity of the materials -- the
sheets of polished marble and granite, and the great lumps of standstone
-- awaiting processing in its yards
Catcastle Buff, Coreshill, Clashach, Dunhouse Buff, Pilhough,
Stainton. The names of the natural sandstones used in modern
construction ring with an enchanting poetry all their own.
Add in Capao Bonito, Grigio Perlo, Botticino Classico and Rosa
Norvegia. The mystique grows as the names of a multitude of marbles and
granites from around the world, which increasingly complement sandstones
in modern structural finishes, run off the tongue.
These materials reflect a craft of great antiquity, but one which is,
after the concrete brutalism of the sixties and the modular excesses of
the seventies, enjoying something of a renaissance.
Just look around you. Office blocks, shop frontages, court and other
public buildings. There are plenty of examples of how sandstone,
granite, marble and slate finishes are being rediscovered and redefined
to meet the requirements of modern construction techniques and to fulfil
the needs of the restoration business.
That should spell big new opportunities for companies which have both
the sources of supply and the design and craft skills to meet this
burgeoning demand. Since the craft appears so traditional, you might
expect all the specialist stone companies to be equally venerable.
Not so. I visited one major Scottish stone company this week whose
whole history could be squeezed into a few grains of time, compared with
the antiquity of the materials -- the sheets of polished marble and
granite, and the great lumps of standstone -- standing, awaiting
processing in its yards.
The Stirling Stone Group, which takes its name from the town in which
it was planted by its founders, started its seventh year of trading last
January. It came to my notice because of the role it has played in the
unfolding story of the receivership of another, older Scottish stone
contractor. Toffolo Jackson, the well-known marble and terrazzo
specialist based on Glasgow's south side, was almost as old as the
century when it went down in January, thanks to sub-contracting bad
debts.
Stirling tried to buy parts of the failed group, principally its
marble cutting equipment and the company name. It was outbid by a
company from London which wanted the whole lot. But Stirling has now
sprouted a new business, Toffolo Stirling, employing the skills of the
grandson of the original Toffolo, Randolf Laing and his colleague Eugene
Brown. Between them, Laing and Brown had accumulated 70 years'
experience at TJ.
Toffolo Stirling will specialise in marble, granite and slate,
creating customised finished panels for installation in front offices,
shopfitting, kitchen work surfaces, bathrooms and all the other places
where non-standard panels are needed. ''Standard panels for major
construction projects are never going to be produced on saws in this
country,'' said Randolf Laing. ''But the kind of market we are targeting
throughout the UK is more than capable of being produced here.''
The new business is to have, subject to planning permission, a
facility close to Stirling Stone's existing two yards. ''Our task is to
get back to what the Toffolo Jackson of old was very good at,'' said
Laing. But why is Stirling Stone giving him this break?
He and Stirling's managing director, Harry Turnbull, have known each
other for more than a decade. Before creating Stirling with three
colleagues, Turnbull was MD of a Balfour Beatty stone subsidiary, based
at Shotts. He took it to a major player, with six quarries, a new
drawing office, and refurbished workshops.
But, between Christmas and New Year 1987, he resigned and, with three
colleagues, set out to do his own thing in stone. ''We had no work. We
built what you see here from scratch without a single penny of public
support,'' he explained.
There was a #60,000 start-up loan promised from the Coal Board, but it
was never drawn down because one of the very first jobs Stirling landed,
erecting Portland limestone cladding in the atrium of BP's London
headquarters, Britannic House, ended up being worth around #1m.
Before that, in the very earliest days of Stirling Stone, it was Laing
who pointed out to Turnbull that McAlpine, the main contractor on the St
Enoch's Centre development in Glasgow, was looking for someone to lay
French limestone flooring in the centre. The fledgling Stirling got the
job and never looked back.
Before the creation of Toffolo Stirling, Turnbull's group had grown
into five distinct businesses, each with its own focus and a degree of
independence under its own MD. ''Overall,'' he explained, ''the
objective has been to bring the traditions of the stone business
together with modern management techniques and build a different kind of
company.''
Stone Design exemplifies that determination. It offers a pre- and
post-tender consultancy service, sourcing and selecting natural
materials -- corridors and rooms in the Stirling offices are lined with
samples of more than 600 different marbles -- and producing working
drawings, stone by intricate stone, using the latest CAD technology.
Stirling Stone Management concentrates on new build contracts,
supplying and attaching natural stone cladding to buildings with the
kind of stainless steel fixings which have revolutionised the mason's
art. If you didn't fix the cladding to modern building frames in this
way, Turnbull pointed out, something would eventually have to give.
Modern structures move and flex in ways very different from the
all-stone structures of old.
Among the contracts carried out so far are the Scandic Crown Hotel in
Edinburgh, the drum structure at Strathclyde University's new graduate
business school, the new housing department on Ingram Street for Glasgow
City Council, and Edinburgh's new Sheriff Courthouse, the biggest
contract to date.
Of the other group companies, Stirling Stone Restoration does what the
name implies. It targets the stone requirements of restoration projects.
It is currently working on Strathclyde University's Ross Priory on Loch
Lomond and on a Bank of Scotland building in Lerwick, where the group
has a satellite office.
Stirling Sealants advises on how stone surfaces can most effectively
be sealed, while Natstone, in London, a 1992 acquisition, is being
transformed from a pure sales operation to a full contracting business.
As one of the four main stone players in the UK's biggest construction
market, that London evolution makes a lot of sense.
''We quarry, we design, we install. We do everything,'' said Turnbull.
''We have strong links with the main marble quarries and processors in
Italy. We are the only UK member of the Marble Institute of America.
''We have a world-wide database on sources of material. And where most
companies do their working drawings in an ad-hoc way, we have
systematised the process. Every piece of stone we produce is a precise
piece in a jigsaw, each piece is quite unique. When we put them on
pallets and deliver them to a site, they can be installed like a Lego
kit.''
Toffolo Stirling adds yet another arm to the group. Until now,
Stirling's only contact with the genral public was a small showroom, the
Marble Factory, behind its main office block, displaying worktops,
fireplaces and other items in solid stone and offering glimpses of the
marble and granite processing plant next door.
Toffolo Stirling aims to recast that approach on a much more ambitious
scale. But why, if Turnbull failed to buy the Toffolo Jackson name from
the receiver, create a new business with part of the same name? Is it a
spoiler?
''This is a brand new business,'' insisted Stirling's MD. ''We are not
trying to suggest we are Toffolo Jackson. We are again marrying
tradition with all our up-to-date knowledge and skills to create
something different. It's a simple as that.''
Being outbid was not, perhaps, that surprising. The Toffolo Jackson
site on the south side of Glasgow lies in a strategically-prime area. It
is one of the failed group's principal assets. It will be interesting to
watch what happens to it in the months ahead.
Harry Turnbull's admiration for Randolf Laing is tangible. ''Randolf
is unique. There is real warmth in this building for what we are doing.
I'm sure Randolf Laing and his team will make it work.''
For his part, Laing is relieved at an outcome which both presents him
with a fresh business challenge and looks like leaving Toffolo Jackson's
creditors happy too.

They have scaled greater heights than most and now they are writing
their life stories. Jack Webster talks to Tom Weir and W H Murray, men
who have inspired countless others to lift their eyes to the mountains.,
WITH the dark side of the mountains much in the news, it is easy to
forget that other side that inspires and exhilarates the thousands who
reach for legitimate adventure. In every respect, climbing has broadened
our horizons.
There are few better witnesses to that fact than Scotland's Grand Old
Men of the Mountains, Tom Weir and W H Murray, who have not only
explored the Himalayas together but, by coincidence, are currently
producing their life stories. Both are into their eighties.
Tom Weir is the pawky little Glaswegian whose popular writing and
television series have made him a familiar figure around Scotland. His
''autobiography of sorts'' as he calls it, Weir's World, is currently
selling like iced-cakes in the shops.
The more reserved, intellectual W H Murray is well through his
much-awaited life story, writing in longhand before transferring it to
an old portable typewriter at his picturesque home on the shores of Loch
Goil.
The universal opinion, well conceded by Tom Weir, is that Murray is
the finest author of the mountains that Scotland has produced.
But if he is a distinguished writer as well as mountaineer, he has a
claim to fame that has never been properly recognised. As people like
Weir will tell you, it was W H Murray, along with his friend Michael
Ward, who suggested the route that would bring the conquest of Everest
-- and who allowed Edmund Hillary to accompany them on the preliminaries
which led to his success of 1953.
Sadly, Murray was not even invited to be part of the Sir John Hunt
expedition that finally conquered the world's highest mountain. But,
characteristically, he was too much of a gentleman to speak out.
Born in 1913 and left fatherless by the First World War, Murray left
Glasgow Academy to join the Union Bank of Scotland, gaining his first
taste of the Scottish mountains in 1934.
''I climbed the Cobbler at Arrochar on a beautiful spring day,'' he
recalls ''and could see those mountains to the north, all snow-covered
and looking like a vast plateau of wild land with no sign of habitation,
all ready to be explored. From then on I was hooked.''
A generation of climbers had been wiped out by the war and, compared
to now, the Scottish mountains were more or less empty.
With crampons still 40 years away, it fell to Murray and half a dozen
contemporaries of the 1930s to devise new ways of cutting foot-holds and
hand-holds in the ice. A shorter axe was among the brainwaves that
turned the Scottish method into an international one.
The Second World War turned Bill Murray into a captain in the Highland
Light Infantry, fighting in the Western Desert before capture at Mersa
Matruh. Held at first on the Adriatic coast of Italy, he set eyes on the
Gran Sasso and started thinking about his beloved Scottish mountains.
He began to write what would become a classic of its genre. But how is
this for an inauspicious start?
''There was no paper, so I had to use toilet paper,'' he remembers.
''I was about three-quarters through the book when we were moved to a
prison camp in Czechoslovakia, so I stuffed the toilet paper into my
tunic.
''But we were searched by the Gestapo, who wouldn't believe it was a
book. They thought I was keeping a record of German troop movements so
they confiscated my manuscript and I never saw it again.
''Once we were settled in the camp, however, the Germans wanted to
divert us from thoughts of escape and I managed to get an exercise book.
I started all over again and found that more memories came back the
second time. So I was indebted to the Gestapo!''
Glad to be back home alive, he quickly gave up his bank job and
decided to write for a living. The book that began on toilet paper was
published in 1947 as Mountaineering in Scotland, still regarded as a
masterpiece. In that same year, the author found his delightful pad by
Loch Goil, from which his output has stretched to 20 books in the past
48 years, ranging from novels to The Story of Everest.
Murray began to explore the Himalayas with his colleague Michael Ward.
Some routes had been closed with China's invasion of Tibet, but still,
they noticed, that forbidden land of Nepal was opening up.
''We asked for sponsorship from the Himalayan committee of the Alpine
Club and the Royal Geographical Society, but their reports said this
route was impracticable. When we persisted, however, they officially
backed us, though not with money.
''The News Chronicle offered #40,000 if reporters could come with us,
but we turned that down. Instead, we took the #5000 offered with no
strings by the Times.''
They asked the experienced Eric Shipton to lead the expedition in the
autumn of 1951. Shipton agreed, though he did not share the hunch of
Murray and Ward that Nepal was the way to go.
When New Zealand heard of the British plans, they asked if their team
could join. So, with Murray as deputy-leader, the team headed off on the
adventure of a lifetime -- in the direction that he was advising.
''The priority was to find if there was a route and climb as far as we
could. There was always the dream that we might reach the summit,'' he
reflects. ''We got to 20,000ft, looked across to Everest, and there it
was -- the route which would surely lead to the top, plain as a
pikestaff.''
There would still be difficulties, including a crevasse, which would
be better crossed in spring than October. But at least they saw what was
required -- a lot more rope and aluminium ladders.
Back home, they prepared for the expedition of 1953, when the military
experience of Brigadier John Hunt would be preferred to Shipton's
leadership. Edmund Hillary was the recommended New Zealander (some
thought Riddiford was a better climber) and Michael Ward, who had been
at school with Hunt, was chosen as the doctor. That left Murray out of
it.
''Yes, I was sorry I didn't have the chance,'' he says quietly. ''I
would like to have been there.''
Instead, Murray was elsewhere in the Himalayas when he bought a jar of
honey wrapped in a newspaper. It was that paper which brought him the
news that Everest had been conquered two weeks earlier!
''I had mixed feelings,'' he says. ''I was delighted that the route we
suggested had been the right one. But I had a sense of disappointment
that there was no longer a highest point left to climb.''
Having written the broader story of Everest, leaving room for a
chapter on the 1953 expedition, he at least had the consolation of
having the very first book on the market, though Hunt himself was to
write the fuller story. Murray confirms that neither Hunt nor Hillary
ever acknowledged their debt to him.
At 82, having survived a near-fatal illness, he lives quietly at Loch
Goil with his wife, the poetess Anne B Murray. The climbing days are
over; the autobiography is on its way.
Meanwhile, at 80, Tom Weir is signing autographed copies of a life
story that has the couthy touch of a Springburn childhood (he too was
left without a father in the Great War): the Band of Hope; grocer's
apprentice with the Co-op; mother working as a wagon-painter at
Cowlairs; forming his own dance-band and giving sister Molly some
microphone experience before she was whisked off to fame by Carrol Levis
Discoveries.
In that age of self-improvement, Weir looked towards Ben Lomond and
dreamed of the mountains and their mystery. Safely through the war, he
found himself on the first post-war British Expedition to the Himalayas,
led by W H Murray in 1950, sailing from Tilbury to Bombay with people
emigrating to Australia -- and meeting many of them two years later on
the way home.
Weir philosophises about the joys of climbing: ''Everyone has to be
confronted with a danger element, pitting your judgment and skills
against the route. When you pull it off, there is a feeling that life is
better than before. Looking around from the mountains, you find a form
of happiness that can be found in no other way. There is a kind of drug
factor.''
Unlike many, however, Tom Weir never saw himself as an Everest-type of
climber: ''I would rather aim at a lower peak and see what's around me.
I'm more interested in that whole kaleidoscope of what lives there, the
people, the birds, the flowers. If you cut it all down to just getting
to the top, you lose 99% of what is important.''
That doesn't mean he has not diced with death. In the Scottish
mountains he survived a 600ft fall in an avalanche and a more serious
accident that squashed his spine in 1970.
Like Murray, Weir has lived from writing in the post-war years, based
at Gartocharn, by Loch Lomond, from where he makes his morning climb of
Duncryne Hill (463ft) and prepares for other adventures of a more
testing nature.
Blessed with good health, he has spare energy to sound off about the
absence of national park status for Scotland's natural assets. He is
appalled there is no management plan for Loch Lomond and has no great
hopes of Scottish National Heritage, headed by Magnus Magnusson.
These two octogenarians, Tom Weir and W H Murray, are treasures in
themselves. At least their writings should guarantee them a place in the
heritage of the nation.

THIS week divorced women and war widows won a victory in their fight
for improved pensions. Two amendments to the Pensions Bill now going
through Parliament will give divorced women better rights to a share in
their ex-husbands' pensions and war widows the right to a better deal if
they remarry.
The Government had already accepted that divorced women needed to be
given rights over their former husbands' pensions. However, it proposed
making husbands responsible for paying their former wives. This raised
the spectre of CSA type battles with elderly women forced to chase their
ex-husbands through the courts when they refused to pay.
A Labour amendment proposed by social security spokeswoman Baroness
Hollis, which was passed by just five votes, hands the job of paying the
pensions of divorced wives to the pension fund itself. This will
increase administrative costs but will undoubtedly be much fairer.
At the moment war widows lose their tax-free pension of #140 a week
when they remarry. The amendment proposed by the 24-year-old Lord
Freyberg, whose grandfather won a VC in the First World War, will allow
them to reclaim their pension if their second husband dies or they
divorce.
Unlike in England, where wives have no legal right over their
husband's pension, Scottish law has long recognised that a husband's
pension should be taken into account in any financial settlement.
However, every divorce settlement is different and it is hard to get
firm evidence that women on this side of the Border actually get a
better financial deal on divorce.
Scottish women do not currently have the right to a slice of their
former husband's pension when he retires as proposed by the amendment to
the Pensions Bill. Instead, it is valued at the point of divorce. This
is a complicated actuarial calculation and involves all manner of
imponderables such as rates of inflation and investment return and the
husband's future employment. It is not uncommon for actuaries to be
employed by both sides. A lump sum value is put on the pension which is
then added to the assets to be divided.
Unless the couple have investments, this can mean the wife gets a
larger slice of the family house or regular payments over many years.
In practice, this may not be very different from what happens in
England. There, women who agree to clean break settlements with no
maintenance for themselves, or who have custody of children who need to
be housed, are usually compensated by getting more than half of the
family home.
Colin Pettigrew, a leading Scottish divorce lawyer with Borland
Montgomerie Keyden, says there are problems with the current system as
it operates here. However, he is not in favour of what is being
proposed. ''I think it will be impossible to administer. I do not
believe that the pension companies will relish the additional
administrative burden of paying out to former wives. In any event,
people often lose touch after divorce, companies get taken over or go
into liquidation. Imagine the difficulty women would have claiming
pensions 20 or 30 years after a divorce.
''If the husband's pension is worth a lot, dividing up the assets can
leave him with no money at all to buy a new home. In some circumstances
the court often utilises its power to order regular payments over a
period of time or to postpone payment of all or part of the lump sum.
When people don't own their home, the pension can be the couple's only
asset and yet it can't be divided. In these circumstances, particularly
if they are nearing retirement, the postponement I've talked about may
be until then.''
But are any of these solutions really dealing with the problem of
making sure divorced women get enough money to live on in retirement and
are adequately compensated for the years they may have spent looking
after a home and children?
Giving wives a share of their former husband's pension at retirement
is attractive if new foolproof systems of pension tracking can be
developed, but this will require Government or industry funding.
The disadvantage of making an allowance for the husband's pension in
the divorce settlement is that there often isn't enough money in the pot
to compensate the wife sufficiently.
Giving her a bigger share of the family home won't necessarily mean an
improved income in old age. A better solution is to change the law to
allow pension funds and personal pensions to be physically split at
divorce. This could be done on the basis of transfer values with a share
going to each person.
The wife's share would be invested in her own pension scheme and she
could add to it if she wanted to. The husband's would be transferred
back into the pension fund. If he was in a final pay scheme with
benefits determined by the number of years spent in it, the effect would
be to reduce his years in the scheme.
This is the solution favoured by the pension industry itself. A joint
Pensions Management Institute (PMI) and Law Society working party
recommended this approach in a report in May 1993. Richard Malone of the
PMI is still hopeful of persuading the Government to adopt this approach
in time for it to be incorporated into the Pensions Bill.
''The Pensions Bill was introduced to increase pension fund security
in the wake of the Maxwell disaster. Help for divorced women was only
included recently, but the matter is now firmly on the agenda and at the
front of people's minds, so we are still lobbying for pension splitting
at divorce as the best way of delivering a fair deal to women.''

FOLK singer Ronnie Browne will have more than a passing interest in
today's Grand Slam rugby clash between Scotland and England at
Twickenham.
Not only, as half of the former folk duo the Corries, will his heart
flutter with that little bit of extra pride when he hears Flower of
Scotland echo round the stadium, but he will also be wondering -- if we
get the right result -- whether he will be asked to do a third
commemorative painting to mark the occasion.
Browne, who divides his time between portrait painting and singing,
has already completed two paintings of previous Grand Slam victories for
the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been sponsoring all of Scotland's
Murrayfield matches since 1982.
To mark the 1984 triumph his painting The Turning Point portrays the
moment when Jim Calder scored the decisive try against France with the
tally at 12 points each.
The 1990 event is captured in Underdog Rampant which shows Scottish
Captain David Sole leaving the pitch after the victory over England.
Although the Royal Bank of Scotland has no financial connection with
today's game, Alwyn James of its corporate communications department
admitted that should Scotland win, it would seriously consider
commissioning a third painting.
Browne, not wishing to tempt fate, told me: ''I will be glued to the
television set, and if Scotland wins, and if the bank decides to
commission another painting, and if they ask me, I would be delighted to
do another.''
Browne, who recently completed a portrait of Scott Hastings and his
wife Jenny with their child Corey, has not been ignoring his other
career.
The finishing touches are now being put to the video to go with his
Love Songs Album which will be released in October.
''There are 16 tracks, and the filming is being done on the West
Highland Way,'' he explained.

APRIL 6 marks the start of the last tax year in which the Inland
Revenue is responsible for the calculation of tax liabilities. From
1996/97 as well as completing a tax return, anyone liable to tax not
collected in full under PAYE will also be required to assess their own
liability and to pay the relevant amount on the due date without any
prompting by the Revenue.
Failure to do this accurately and on time will be expensive -- tax
paid late attracts an automatic interest charge plus a fixed penalty
surcharge, and there are also fixed penalties for late filing of a tax
return.
The British tax system is very complex, so to make it possible for the
average person to comply with the new arrangements, the most radical
overhaul of the system ever undertaken is gradually taking place. The
aim is to achieve simplification of the system by 1996/67, but to arrive
at this involves changes which will mean even more complication in the
period leading up to self-assessment.
This is exactly what has happened with the changes introduced to deal
with taxing the profits from land. These come into effect from 1995/96.
Typically, profits from land are represented by rental income, but if
you receive an income from allowing land to be used for car parking,
advertising billboards or other such purposes this is also caught by the
changes. So, too, is income from renting furnished property. And
landowners and farmers are likely to be deeply affected by the new
rules.
Put at its simplest, such rental income will in future be taxed in the
same way as profits from any other business. This means accounts will
need to be prepared on an earnings basis, taking into account income due
and deducting expenses as they accrue. This is quite different from the
current system, and paying tax on rental profits worked out on the basis
of cash payments received and paid will stop.
For many, the change is more apparent than real. For example, if you
collect rent on fixed days in the year and have largely fixed deductions
from it, there is likely to be little practical difference in the amount
subject to tax.
For others, though, the change will be very significant indeed. Some
landowners have for years included rental profits separately in their
business accounts. The new requirement is that they must be worked out
for a period of account that is the same as the tax year. In other
words, the accounts must be drawn up to April 5. But not many business
accounts are drawn up to this date.
Farmers, in particular, often find it an inconvenient date because of
the difficulty in counting their stock, especially livestock, when young
animals are just being born. Typically, they prepare accounts of their
trading profits to another date.
As a result, people in this category will have to prepare two sets of
accounts to different dates, or change the date of their trading
accounts to April 5 as well.
Changing the accounting date of trading profits has disadvantages
under the new self-assessment system, but keeping two accounting dates
also gives problems. For example, if you claim a deduction for the wages
of a handyman which relates both to work done on rented property and on,
say, the farm, splitting the wages paid will require close attention.
If you have borrowed money through a bank loan to purchase property
which you rent out, you will have been able to deduct the interest from
the rent received, provided the property is let or available for letting
at a commercial rent for at least 26 weeks in the year. This rule is
quite restrictive and has been abolished from 1995/96. Instead, interest
can be deducted if it is a legitimate business expense paid wholly and
exclusively for the purpose of the rental business.
Other deductions from rent must also meet the test that they are
wholly and exclusively incurred for the purpose of the rental business.
The good news for those who rent furnished property is that a deduction
can, if you choose, still be made for wear and tear on furniture
equivalent to 10% of the rent charged.
Even if you rent more than one property, you are treated as carrying
on one business, so if allowable deductions exceed rents received on any
one property, the excess can be deducted from other rents. Losses can be
carried forward indefinitely for offset against future profits of the
rental business.
The special rent-a-room rule, under which you can rent out
accommodation in your home and receive income of up to #3250 free of
tax, is not affected by the changes. Equally, holiday letting, which is
already treated as a trade, is not affected.
The new rules come into effect for 1995/96. Although the old rules,
whereby rents are taxed as they arise, continue to apply to 1994/95, you
may need to give careful thought to what you put in your tax return for
this year. One consequence of the change is that profits or expenses may
be taken into account more than once when the change is made from the
old system to the new, or they may not be taken into account in either
year. There are no statutory transitional years to bridge the gap.
The old rules have been subject to all kinds of variations in practice
in the past which have been accepted over many years, resulting in the
correct amount being subject to tax even though they did not strictly
comply with the legal position. Any such agreements with the Revenue
will lapse, including agreements to treat rents arising in an accounting
period not co-terminous with the end of the tax year as being taxable in
that year or the following one. This especially applies to furnished
property.
If you applied the strict statutory position up to now, you can work
out your rental profit for 1994/95 and add or deduct any receipts or
payments that fall into the gap or are taxed twice.
If you used a non-statutory basis, the Inland Revenue will look for
you to produce accounts from the end of the period taxed in 1993/94 to
April 5 of this year. It will tax an average of 12 months of this
period. This means thinking ahead to your position in 1995/96 and making
the adjustments now. If you don't check your position you may lose out
as the strict statutory rules will be applied to both years.

He was the antithesis of today's rap artists with their negative,
destructive messages
A touching portrait of Curtis Mayfield, one of America's great
performers, is to be broadcast next week
EVERY now and then you'll be driving round with the radio on and some
DJ, usually an old one who has not yet been sacked by Radio One, will
play it. It starts with a strident, brass intro which takes your breath
away, makes you shiver no matter how many times you hear it. And then
Curtis Mayfield sings and, for three minutes at least, everything is
fine with the world. Move On Up is that kind of song. It is also a sad
reminder of a tragedy which robbed the world of one of its greatest
musical talents.
In September 1990, Curtis Mayfield was tuning up to play an open-air
benefit concert at Wingate Field in Brooklyn. As he walked on stage, his
guitar strapped around his shoulder, there was a sudden gust of wind. It
brought down a lighting scaffold on top of him. Mayfield remembers
little about it. He came to lying on the stage, unable to move his arms
and legs. He was rushed to hospital but no amount of treatment could
improve his condition. His spine had been snapped. Today he remains
confined to a wheelchair, paralysed from the neck down, a quadraplegic
with no hope of recovery. He is unable to sing and he cannot write down
even a note of music.
Now, for the first time, a documentary has been made about Curtis
Mayfield. Omnibus (Tuesday, BBC1) traces both his career and the
influence he had on black soul music over a 30-year period. For producer
Anne Elleston and writer/presenter Caryl Phillips it is a labour of
love. They are acutely aware of the contribution which Mayfield made to
popular music.
''I got the idea to make the programme when I read an article about
Mayfield in Rolling Stone,'' explained Elleston. ''I've always been a
great fan of his music but I hadn't realised that he had been involved
in that accident. I also didn't realise how many current artistes were
re-recording his music and that he had been so influential.''
She then approached black writer Phillips (who was short-listed for
last year's Booker Prize) whom she knew shared an interest in Mayfield's
music. He was able to persuade the performer to give his first major TV
interview since his accident.
''The tragedy is that he can't write because he doesn't have the power
of his hands and yet he remains an immensely resilient character with a
wonderful spirit,'' added Elleston.
The documentary is a sincere and often touching portrait of one of
America's great performers. In a remarkable career which spanned 30
years he was a singer, a songwriter, a guitarist, an arranger, a music
publisher, and an astute businessman.
Mayfield, now aged 52, was born and brought up in Chicago's notorious
Cabrini Green area. He bought his first guitar at the age of eight and
wrote his first hit song -- Gypsy Woman -- when he was 12. He was
greatly influenced by his early exposure to gospel music and, before he
left school, he was already attempting to make the classic synthesis
between the sacred and the profane, between spiritual music and soul.
His career really took off when he formed the vocal group, The
Impressions, in the early 1960s with his childhood friend Jerry Butler.
Their role models were performers like The Coasters and Sam Cooke.
Indeed, Mayfield took his distinctive high tenor, almost falsetto, vocal
style from Cooke.
Butler, still a solo performer but now more closely associated with
Chicago politics, says of him: ''People say that Curtis is perhaps a
black Bob Dylan. I would say that Bob Dylan is a white Curtis
Mayfield.''
In the late 1960s Mayfield left the Impressions and embarked upon a
solo career. It co-incided with the rise of the civil rights movement in
America. Much of his work, songs like People Get Ready and Choice of
Colours, were taken up as, not so much protest songs, but more as
anthems for the movement. His songs were acutely political but they were
also very positive. They were an inspiration to a generation, capturing
the optimism of the time and preaching the virtues of black
consciousness.
His prolific output also touched on other issues which were important
to blacks. There was a disproportionate number of blacks and poor white
Americans sent as cannon fodder to Vietnam. Mayfield reflected upon
their plight on their return from the war with songs like Back To The
World and We Got To Have Peace.
By the time Mayfield started making solo albums, in the early 70s, the
black perspective in America had changed. The Martin Luther King era was
over and blacks had begun to develop an attitude. According to Caryl
Phillips, this was best illustrated by the so-called ''blaxploitation''
movies of the time, like Shaft and Superfly. Mayfield agreed to write
the music for Superfly but he was uncomfortable with what he perceived
to be the movie's glamorising of the drugs culture. It was, he said,
like ''a cocaine advert''. So the songs he wrote for Superfly were like
a counterpoint to the message of the movie, uncompromisingly anti-drugs
poems like Pusherman.
Throughout the 70s his lyrics raged, not only against drugs, but also
against the increasing violence of the black community and about
homelessness in America's urban housing schemes, the projects. He was,
in effect, the antithesis of today's rap artists with their negative,
destructive messages. The irony is, of course, that many of these young
performers were greatly influenced by his music. Indeed, the last thing
Curtis Mayfield recorded before his accident was a re-working of
Superfly with rap star Ice T.
Today Mayfield is confined to a wheelchair in his home in a quiet
suburb of Atlanta, a home he shares with his second wife and six of his
11 children (songs were not the only thing at which Curtis was
prolific).
In his interview, Phillips asks him about the frustration of not being
able to write or perform. Although he can converse he cannot sing; his
diaphragm does not function properly. He replies: ''At the moment I'm
just keeping it all to myself. I hope in the very near future, with the
hi-tech technology and voice computers, that I can find a way to get
back to writing and preparing compositions.
''I have ideas but if you can't jot them down then they fade like
dreams.''
Does he get lonely? ''Of course I get lonely, simply because of not
being able to get up and out of here. I've been an independent person
all my life. But things could always be worse,'' he says.

THE Laidlaw Group is delighted to have signed a sponsorship deal with
Hearts Football Club which saw 11 players being presented with the keys
of brand new Fords.
The deal must have given the company's operations director, Tom
Fairgrieve, added pleasure as he was once a Jambo player himself.
Fairgrieve signed for the Premier League side away back in 1968 as a
lad of 16. He played in midfield and made several first team appearances
before leaving Tynecastle in 1971.
The new sponsorship deal will be worth #100,000 to the club over a
two-year period.
John Catney, general manager of Laidlaw Strathclyde, assured Business
Diary that it was purely coincidental that Fairgrieve was a former
player, and that he had not influenced the company's decision.
But Catney immediately revealed a slight prejudice when he joked:
''There are clear benefits for both parties. Hearts get to rationalise
their vehicle fleet, and we get good seats at the Scottish Cup Final --
which we have no doubt Hearts will win!''
Hearts' semi-final opponents Airdrie might have a slight disagreement
with that statement, while no doubt Hibernian are confident they can
take care of Celtic in their semi-final and go on to lift the Scottish
Cup.
The professor
and the passport
PROFESSOR Ross Harper will have to be careful where he goes on his
world travels as president of the International Bar Association.
Recently he became the owner of a second passport after discovering
while in Japan that he required a visa for a trip he was making to
Nigeria, three days after his return from the Far East.
He was issued with a second passport but warned that many countries
object to travellers possessing more than one such document. Rather
ominously, the passport office added that in one country it is a
criminal offence -- but it did not mention which one.
Professor Harper received his second travel document plus visa when it
was sent by special courier to Vienna, where he was squeezing in a visit
between Japan and Nigeria. He then entered Nigeria with his two
passports keeping his fingers crossed that it was not the country which
put you behind bars if you were caught with a second passport.
Business Diary checked with the passport office which revealed that
the country in question is Saudi Arabia -- so Professor Harper should
steer well clear of that destination, or he might be seeing more Arabian
nights than he bargained for.
Winning chance
for revellers
THE Red Balloon Ball on May 6 in the Glasgow Hilton in aid of the
British Lung Foundation could turn out to be more like a night at the
casino, as revellers try to win a #58,000 Mercedes Benz 280SL
Convertable.
All you have to do to win the car, which was donated by Vardy
Continental of Glasgow, is come up with six sixes in one throw of the
dice. The cost of one throw will be #2.50 and if you cough up #5 you can
have three attempts.
Ball organiser Alan Hogerth of the British Lung Foundation joked: ''We
don't know what the odds are on someone winning the car but it is
certainly a lot better than their chance of winning the National Lottery
jackpot, and we hope that someone wins the prize.''
He expects around 450 to attend the ball, but there are still some
tables of 10 available at a cost of #400.
Money raised will go to the British Lung Foundation, the only UK-wide
charity which raises funds for research and treatment of all lung
diseases.
If you are interested in throwing the dice, or even having a ball,
contact Alan Hogerth on 0141 204 4110.
Any bids for a
good cause?
WITH the help of generous antique dealers and Scottish artists, the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund has put together an antiques and fine art
auction which will be held at Prestonfield House Hotel in Edinburgh next
Thursday evening. Viewing starts at 6.30pm and the auction kicks off at
8pm.
The charity has been assisted in staging the event by Phillips
Auctioneers and Justerini and Brooks wine merchants.
Eighty lots will go under the hammer, including a 19th-century
Japanese bronze hand mirror and an oil painting by Scottish artist Lucy
Ross.
Tickets costing #10 can be obtained from Hazel Wilson at the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund on 01786 479137 or you can pay on entry. The ticket
includes a catalogue and free wine to ensure a pleasant evening.
Have breakfast

MORE on charity. The Scottish Council for Spastics is delighted with
the response to its business breakfast with Tom Farmer of Kwik-Fit to be
held at the Glasgow Moat House on March 23.
More than 120 will be attending the bucks fizz breakfast which starts
at 7am, and the charity hopes to raise more than #7000 from the event.
However, it still has a handful of tables left, and Wendy Robbins would
really like to put up the House Full sign.
If you fancy starting your day listening to Tom Farmer telling you why
''Business Can Be Fun'', why not give her a call on 0131 337 9876?
Learn to cash

at the Moat House Hotel in Glasgow.
Paul Blanchet, senior business affairs adviser from the World Bank in
Paris, will give those attending advice on how Scottish companies can
take advantage of the Bank's funding of projects which amounted to
$20.8bn in 1994.
Closing date for registration is March 29. If you are interested in

HARD on the heels of selling its scientific instruments division for
#202m, Fisons has found a buyer for its pharmaceutical research and
development activities.
The Swedish Astra group is buying the activities centred on
Loughborough and Rochester in the US and the price is exactly the same
as the scientific instrument division fetched. The deal nearly completes
the fundamental reshaping of Fisons, which has been dogged by problems
in recent years.
It just has the laboratory supplies side to dispose ofand Fisons chief
executive Stuart Wallis yesterday disclosed that talks were under way
with a number of interested parties.
The business has sales of around #500m so its disposal will realise a
further few hundred million. All Fisons will have left after selling
these divisions plus the horticultural products business will be the
marketing of pharmaceuticals developed by others, on which it will
concentrate.
After the latest sale, the group will have a fighting fund of about
#200m, according to Mr Wallis, in order to buy licence agreements,
royalty rights and joint-ventures.
''We can now do the sort of things we have needed to do for years but
never had the funds,'' Mr Wallis added. He has moved quickly to change
radically the shape of the group since his appointment six months ago.
It was felt the drugs research programme was too small to justify and
its concentration on respiratory complaints will make it fit well with
Astra's similar activities. The deal will raise the Swedish company's
research spending by over #50m a year. It includes facilities worth
#115m, where 1100 people work.
However, 200 will be retained by Fisons which is retaining rights to
certain products, delivery devices such as inhalers and respiratory
compounds currently in development.
It will also retain intellectual property rights over the active
ingredients in its Intal and Tilade preparations and will receive
royalties on the net sales of all products derived from patented
entities in research and compounds which it currently has in exploratory
or full development.
The effect of the sale will be to reduce Fisons' #70m research bill by
one-third this year and by two-thirds thereafter, while allowing the
group to retain the fruits of its research into respiratory products.
Astra president and chief executive Hakan Mogren commented: ''The
addition of a significant number of skilled scientists in the UK will
substantially raise our capacity for both exploratory, preclinical, and
clinical research.''
Fisons shares reacted positively, gaining 7p to 163p, though the group
has to show it can build up a portfolio of marketing acquisitions and
successfully integrate them.

A MEETING of the full Takeover Panel yesterday dismissed an appeal by
Trafalgar House to allow its revised bid for Northern Electric to go
ahead.
This followed an earlier ruling by the Panel temporarily blocking the
bid. It means that unless Trafalgar can agree terms for an uncontested
offer, it must wait for the full 12-month period -- which normally
follows the lapsing of a bid -- before it is allowed to try again.
The Panel's decision comes as no real surprise following its initial
ruling late on Wednesday. But it does mean that the chances of a merger
are now considerably reduced and Northern Electric's price reflected
this, crashing 54p to 727p.
Trafalgar had bid #11 per share but this was allowed to lapse and a
revised offer of #9.50 was proposed after the industry regulator
Professor Littlechild announced that he was undertaking a pricing review
and threw the whole sector into confusion.
Northern Electric has said that it would not consider a fresh bid from
Trafalgar until the uncertainty over electricty prices has been removed.
Professor Littlechild is expected to announce later this month whether
he intends to tighten electricity price controls but full details may
not be revealed until the end of June.
Over half of Northern Electric's shareholders had been shown to be in
favour of Trafalgar's bid of #9.50 being allowed to go ahead
immediately.
Northern would not be drawn as to what it would consider a fair offer
but a spokesman said, ''Assuming (Professor Littlechild) acts like a
reasonable man, #9.50 is not enough.''
The Panel's ruling comes despite Northern Electric's concession that
it would waive the 12 months rule and allow Trafalgar to make a hostile
bid following the review.
Trafalgar expressed its disappointment that, despite strong support
from Northern shareholders, the Northern board would not consent to a
new offer at #9.50 and the Takeover Panel did not exercise its powers to
allow such an offer. It said that in the circumstances its offer cannot
now remain on the table.

CAIRN Energy's gains on the sale of US interests boosted headline
profits, as well as the Edinburgh-based company's acquisition and
exploration potential.
However, stripping out the major impact of exceptional items, 1994
operating profits of #1.1m were less than half of the previous year's
#2.6m.
With the oil and gas explorer and producer having gone through a
process of radical change during the year, reducing its stake in former
US subsidiary Cairn Energy USA from 60.5% to 17.5%, yesterday's results
are not particularly meaningful going forward.
What is more significant is the strengthening of Cairn's balance sheet
as a result of the sale.
Net cash of #10.8m at the year-end compared with net debt of #8.3m at
the end of 1993 and chief executive Bill Gammell is eyeing opportunities
to acquire more producing interests in the UK and Continental Europe.
Mr Gammell, who is also excited by the potential of Cairn's interests
in Bangladesh, said: ''There was a significant strategic shift in our
focus during 1994. That gives us an excellent opportunity to look for
acquisitions and participate in exploration this year.''
Taking into account a #4.7m exceptional charge for write-down of its
UK offshore exploration pool because of unsuccessful drilling results,
and a #13.3m gross gain on the US share sale, pre-tax profits rose from
#2.3m to #9.4m.
However, a #4.1m provision for tax on the US sale, Cairn's only tax
charge, results in a more relevant 1994 earnings figure of #5.3m.
Boosted by acquisition, average UK onshore oil production rose from
1294 barrels per day in 1993 to 1922bpd.
With horizontal drilling techniques now being employed, Cairn's
onshore interests, located in the south of England, are currently
yielding 2540bpd.
Operating profits were hit by lower oil prices, with Cairn selling oil
at an average of $14.03 (#9.15) per barrel during 1994, compared with
$15.23 (#10.13) the previous year.
Overall group oil and gas production fell from the equivalent of
5000bpd during 1993 to 4927bpd, pushed down by a natural decline in
Cairn Energy USA's gas production and the fact that the US subsidiary's
results were only consolidated until October 11.
Cairn has formed a new US subsidiary, CE North America, and may
explore alongside Cairn Energy USA in the Gulf of Mexico this year.
Shares in Cairn closed unchanged at 80p.

* My wife and I have accumulated various investments over the last
nine years, but from January 1996 when we are both retired I intend to
boost our income from our pensions by cashing up to #10,000 per annum. I
would be grateful if you could suggest the best method of doing this or
indeed an alternative method of boosting our income so that we can enjoy
some holidays from our hard-earned savings.
Our investments are 975 Abbey National, 221 BAA, 660 British Gas, 693
BP, 505 Eurotunnel, 1600 BT, 2702 Hydro Electric, 410 National Power,
250 PowerGen, 4040 Clerical Medical Pedigree Growth, 4000 TSB European
Acc, 3720 Scottish Mutual Growth and 902 Scottish Mutual Opportunity. We
also have #18,000 in a Royal Bank Tessa and #15,000 in Royal Bank fixed
income (three years).
* In all, your savings and investments amount to about #85,000, and it
seems unrealistic to us to encash up to #10,000 per annum without
damaging your long-term financial security.
However, you are deriving little or no income from your four unit
trust investments and your shares in Eurotunnel, worth about #25,000.
These could be reinvested in dividend-paying equities to produce
additional income for you. Alternatively, part or all of these funds
could be redeployed in gilts where yields of around 8.5% can be
obtained.
If you feel you can afford it, there is nothing to prevent you drawing
on your savings to finance the holiday of a lifetime after you retire.
* I am 63 years of age and have just sold my business which I started
10 years ago on being made redundant. My wife and I have the following
assets: house worth #100,000, endowment policy of about #50,000 payable
in June 1996, a #35,000 share portfolio, two Tessas payable next
January, #22,000 in a joint Halifax account and pension policies with a
current value of about #70,000. I should have about #60,000 after tax
from the sale of my business.
My state pension and pension from a previous employment at #4200 a
year start from October 1996, and my wife has a current state pension of
#52 a week. The advice of a financial adviser is to leave our personal
pensions until rates improve, and invest #50,000 in M&amp;G Managed Income
Bond, using capital to make up the balance of income requirements until
the pensions are due.
At this time income from the pension annuity and income bond should be
about #14,000 per annum and more than enough for our needs. The balance
could then be invested in the stock market. Your comments and advice
would be welcome.
* Annuity rates are likely to improve a little so it is not a bad idea
to wait. The M&amp;G Managed Income Bond is a reasonable suggestion so long
as it will form part of your ongoing portfolio. However, you may also
like to consider PEPs. You have to watch the annual charges but you and
your wife could put up to #36,000 into general and single company PEPs
in coming weeks, half in the current tax year and half in 1995/96.
* Following an answer you gave to a query concerning Invalidity
Benefit I feel that I have been given the wrong information. I have been
in receipt of Invalidity Benefit since 1984 without a break. I think you
would agree that this is a long-term disability situation.
I will be 65 on June 1, and have been informed that I can no longer be
paid Invalidity Benefit or the new Incapacity Benefit after that date
and that I must claim retirement pension. This is contrary to the
information you gave to the aforementioned questioner. Have I been given
the correct information? If not, what should I do?
* The change to this benefit is complex but you will automatically be
transferred to the new Incapacity Benefit on April 13 and the amount you
receive will be unchanged. Then you will have to claim retirement
pension from your 65th birthday, as you have been advised.
People currently in receipt of Invalidity Benefit who will be over
state pension age on April 12 will be able to choose between receiving
the long-term rate of Incapacity Benefit for five years or opting for
the retirement pension straight away. The long-term rate will be based
on what the pension would be but will not be taxable.
* I write for advice for an aged relative whose husband died recently.
There is a severe drop in income due to the loss of the deceased's
pension and the cessation of an occupational pension paid by his former
employer, Strathclyde Regional Council. There is a little over #11,000
capital available and the funeral account is paid.
Obviously maximum income with security of capital is required. The
widow lives in sheltered accommodation and will not be a taxpayer. She
qualifies for partial rent and council tax rebates but not for income
support. I am thinking in terms of an investment of, say, #10,000 in a
pensioners' guaranteed bond at 7.5% paid as monthly income. Can you
agree with this or offer alternatives?
* The Pensioners' Bond is difficult if not impossible to beat for its
return, particularly for monthly income and its security, and it looks
the best investment in this case. Up to #20,000 can be put into it.
It is worth remembering that the interest is fixed for five years and
if the funds are required before this period is up there is a penalty.
Sixty days' notice of withdrawal has to be given during which no
interest is payable. If this is a concern, part of the money could be
put into National Savings' Income Bonds which yield 6.5% gross.
Withdrawal still requires three months' notice but there is no interest
penalty.
If encashed in the first year only half the interest is paid. The
interest is variable so will change according to interest rates
generally and the next move is most likely to be upwards.
Worried about bond returns
* In June 1992 I purchased a Scottish Provident capital investment
bond for #10,000. By June 1994 this had increased in value to #12,057
and I was pleased with the performance. In December 1992, having taken
financial advice, I invested #10,000 in Scottish Amicable's capital
guarantee bond. By December 1993 this bond was worth #11,568, but by
December 1994 the value, instead of gaining, fell by #500 to #11,068.
Both bonds are for five years.
I know the stock market has an effect, but I cannot understand the
difference in performance unless it is due to a fall between July and
December. Can you please explain since I do not wish to contact the
adviser, who, I believe, gave me poor advice on the Scottish Amicable
bond, nor do I wish to pay for a further consultation.
* Between June 1 and December 1, 1994 the FTSE-100 share index gained
about 100 points, but it was nearly 200 points lower than it had been on
December 1, 1993. At the end of 1993 the index was rising rapidly
towards a peak of 3520, achieved in early February 1994, since then it
has lost the better part of 500 points as the authorities in the US and
the UK have raised short-term interest rates to avert an upsurge in
inflationary pressures from robust growth.
For your convenience, the closing FTSE-100 share indices for the first
trading day of each month were as follows: June 1992, 2698; December
1992, 2792; December 1993, 3233; June 1994, 2932; and December 1994,
3040.
Both your bonds have broadly reflected the ups and downs of the stock
market. Indeed, they seem to have slightly outperformed the index over
most periods, which is as it should be since the underlying investments
would have earned dividends for the funds.
There is nothing surprising in the #500 drop in the value of your
Scottish Amicable bond between December 1993 and December 1994. On a
number of occasions we have highlighted the superior capital performance
of investment and unit trusts to bonds, but on this occasion we cannot
fault the performance of your bonds.
At this stage, our main concern is that you have ploughed such large
sums of money into just two investments. A spread of six or eight would
have been more appropriate for a sum of #20,000. You may be able to
rectify this as your bonds mature.
The final paragraph of your letter gives rise to some concern. A good
financial adviser, who has earned commissions from placing your
investments, should be monitoring them for you and should be prepared to
give advice on their continued suitability without a consultation fee.
Uncertainty over
dividend taxation
* I have shares in most of the companies which have been privatised
but these are in my mother's name on my behalf because I am under 18
years old. Is it possible for me to reclaim the tax on the dividend
income or will this affect my mother's tax position?
* This will depend on the source of the funds used to purchase the
shares. If they were bought using money given to you by someone other
than your parents, for example a grandparent, or money you earned
yourself, the dividends will be treated as your income for tax purposes.
To establish whether you are entitled to reclaim tax you must
calculate your total income including dividends, bank and building
society interest and vocational earnings, and if the total is less than
the personal tax allowance, which for this year is #3445, then you will
be entitled to a repayment. If you have owned the shareholdings from
their date of issue you may also be entitled to claim repayment of tax
deducted in the last six years.
If, however, the shares were purchased with money received from a
parent who is still alive and resident in the UK, the dividend income is
treated as belonging to that parent until you are 18. No tax would be
repayable unless that parent was not liable to pay any tax. The only
exception to this rule is if your total income from funds given to you
by your parents does not exceed #100. Then it would not be aggregated
with their income.
* My wife and I are both in our late sixties and at present we receive
the income tax age allowance. It will, however, be necessary to realise
some capital this year by selling shares which we have held for a long
time, and there is likely to be tax due on the gains. I understand that
these gains are taxed as if they were income. Is it, therefore, the case
that our claim for age allowance will be affected?
* Your entitlement to age allowance will not be affected by any gain
made on the sale of shares. If there is tax payable on the gains, it
will be capital gains tax not income tax, although the rate of tax
charged will depend on the level of your other income.
Only gains in excess of the annual exemption will be assessable, and
at present the exemption available to both yourself and your wife is
#5800 rising to #6000 on gains realised after April 5. The balance of
gain over the exemption will be taxed at the rate of income tax you
would pay if the gains were the top slice of your income. Although it
may seem confusing, this is not the same as treating the gains as
income, and they are not included in the calculation of total income for
age allowance purposes.

ANOTHER hammer blow against the Stock Exchange's system for trading
shares has been dealt by the Office of Fair Trading.
The OFT has ruled that the present quote-driven system which lies at
the heart of the way the stock market operates is ''significantly
anti-competitive.''
This the second adverse report from the OFT but it is up to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke whether changes will be made.
Early action is unlikely because the system has given the London market
the edge compared with other markets when it comes to liquidity, the
ability to deal in any share at any time the market is open.
The London Stock Exchange differs from most others in using
market-makers which have to quote prices when asked to do so. The
alternative used elsewhere is a order-driven market where essentially
sellers and buyers are matched up.
OFT director general Sir Bryan Carsberg says he is aware of the debate
between the relative merits of quote-driven and order-driven markets.
''It is not my role to advocate either system but I am concerned that
the development of order-driven markets in London should not be
artificially inhibited by rules which limit the business they can
attract,'' he comments.
Market makers have exclusive access to prices displayed by
inter-dealer broker networks and exclusive rights to display their
prices on SEAQ screens.
Sir Bryan says: ''If the obligation on market makers to display their
best prices on SEAQ is removed this should increase the potential for
exchanges to compete and for the market to determine the future
development of each system.''

Amid the many splendours of a Jodhpur palace William Russell lived
like a king for a few days
INDIA is full of palaces, many of which have been turned into hotels,
some more mouldering than others, and one or two delivering much less
than is promised, if the truth were told. The setting may be glorious,
but the hotel is distinctly frayed at the edges. Time has not been kind.
The Umaid Bhawan Palace Hotel in Jodhpur, however, is unlike all the
others which tend to have been made from palaces built in the eighteenth
or nineteenth centuries. This palace was completed just over 50 years
ago and, although a substantial number of its 300 rooms have been set
aside for the hotel, there are plenty left over to house the present
Maharaja, Gaj Singh, in a style his family has been accustomed to.
The delights of Rajasthan are many and well-documented. India is a
maddening country, a place of thronging crowds, appalling poverty,
amazing wealth and constant irritation -- there is always someone trying
to sell something, probably an overpriced carpet or some monstrous piece
of brasswork. It is, however, a country around which one can easily
travel. The bus services are good. The trains, provided you equip
yourself with an India Rail pass, thus avoiding ticket queues and
leaving only the task of queueing to make a reservation, are comfortable
and run to time. And people do speak English.
But while there are plenty of international hotels and an excellent
network of state guesthouses, what the foreign visitor really wants is
to live like a maharaja. For a couple of days you too can live like a
monarch of all you survey.
The Umaid Bhawan palace was built by the present maharaja's
grandfather, Umaid Singh, the 38th maharaja in the line. Work began in
1929, some 3000 labourers and craftsmen were employed, and building was
only completed in 1943. Among the wonders of Delhi are the great palaces
of state designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens which line the Raj Path, a
display of imperial splendour which manages to combine the glory of the
Mogul tradition with a twentieth-century sensibility. It was Lutyens who
laid out the New Delhi city plan and the Viceroy's House he designed,
completed in 1930, was the most monumental British building to be
constructed since Sir Christopher Wren built St Paul's Cathedral.
Not much chance of holidaying in a Lutyens building in India, one
would have thought. But there is, although at second-hand. The Umaid
Bhawan Palace was designed by two British architects, J R Lodge and H V
Lanchester, who worked with Lutyens, and it is recognisably in his
style. The vast building with its monumental central dome, surrounding
turrets, soaring pillars, vaulted halls, and quiet internal courtyards
is built in a rose-pink stone like the ones along the Raj Path and
stands on top of a small hill.
The rooms are furnished in art-deco style, much of the furnishing
being original palace furniture. My bedroom had a magnificent black and
red dragon mural above the bed, and a bathroom so vast it could have
been the set for a Busby Berkeley production number what with its
floor-to-ceiling mirror and lights. The antique shower above an equally
historic enamel bath was a miracle of design, a great soup-plate affair
which spilled the water lavishly and soothingly over the bather, unlike
those power heads of the jet-set hotel bathrooms which hurl scalding
fluid at all the wrong places. The tropical downpour they provided was
just what one needed at the end of a tiring day sightseeing in Jodhpur.
The magnificence of the public rooms is breath-taking. Through a
pillared portico, down a lobby, garlanded with flowers and a red spot on
one's forehead, one glides, luggage dispatched to your room, to the main
hall. This is a huge domed circular affair, a sea of shining marble with
scattered here and there Louis XIV sofas and chairs with mirrors inlaid
into their backs. They seem too delicate to sit on but are nothing of
the kind. Recline in state and sip a welcoming drink of fresh fruit
juice. That dome, by the way, is false. Above it lie the Maharaja's
private appartments surmounted by yet another dome.
There are formal gardens to wander round, roses galore to enjoy,
peacocks strutting down shady pergolas, and a terrace on which to dine
or drink long cool glasses of freshly squeezed limes and soda while
enjoying the view. You may even see a hawk seize one of the palace
pigeons and head off to enjoy its supper. In the basement of the palace
is the swimming-pool, a riot of blue and white signs of the zodiac, cool
and dimly lit. And if it is strong drink you crave, the bar is easily
found. A large stuffed black bear carrying a tray with a bottle of
Scotch on it stands outside the door of the bar.
As a base for seeing Rajasthan it is excellent. The town of Jodhpur, a
walled city, is the largest in the region, has excellent handicraft
shops and the charming little houses of the old city are painted blue.
The fort rising on a hill above the town is well worth a visit. Views
apart, it has some fine public rooms and a museum with weapons and
carriages and howdahs belonging to the rulers. The maharaja's bedroom is
a riot of mosaic with Christmas tree baubles purchased on a visit to
London suspended from the ceiling, and there is a collection of royal
cradles, including one which could be rocked electrically.
There are wildlife sanctuaries and countless forts and temples to
visit, folk-dancers to watch, ruined cities to discover, and the
Maharaja's train on which to make the trip to the desert town of
Jaiselmer. India is endless in its variety. A good guidebook, something
for upset stomaches -- avoid salads if you can -- a spray to repel the
mosquitoes and an ointment to soothe when you fail, and you will be up
and away. It is not for the squeamish. It is for those who would like to
be thought adventurous, while not actually doing anything too difficult.
And, above all, if you want to live like a king just once in your life
this is the one country where you can afford that luxury.

When the spirit moves us it seems we will set off on all manner of
trails. Following in the footsteps of vineyards, breweries, and whisky
distilleries, Kirsty Scott discovers a Plymouth gin distillery which is
opening its doors to tourists
WINE, whisky, and beer have long been on the tourism trail. It was
only a matter of time before ''mothers' ruin'' got in on the act.
The Black Friars Distillery in Plymouth has been the home of Plymouth
Gin for more than 200 years -- it's the only English gin still being
made in its original distillery. Now it is set to open its doors to
tourists in a similar manner to many vineyards, breweries, and whisky
distilleries around Britain.
Between Easter and September, visitors will be able to discover the
history and craft of the gin-making process, touch and smell the
ingredients, and see the copper pot still in which all Plymouth Gin has
been made for the past 100 years. And, of course, for those old enough,
there are the inevitable tasting sessions.
Founded in 1793, the distillery's home dates back to the fifteenth
century when it was a Dominican monastery that later served as a
debtors' prison.
The brand has enjoyed a special relationship with the Royal Navy. At
one time, every new ship was presented with a Plymouth Gin commissioning
kit for the officers' mess.
For opening and admission details phone 0752 667062.
* ALSO during the Easter weekend, Chester's Boat Museum is playing
host to a Boaters' Gathering featuring a display of vintage canal narrow
boats, demonstrations of traditional boating crafts, and boaters' games
such as horse-shoe throwing.
The Chester Moat House (five-crown, highly commended) is offering a
special Boaters' Gathering weekend deal at #58 per adult and discounts
for children, to include dinner, bed and breakfast, and a ticket to the
museum, available on any one night between April 14 and 17.
During the same period, the Plymouth Moat House has a special break
designed to entertain people of all ages. Activities planned include a
Mad Hatter's tea party and disco, a visit from the Easter Bunny on
Easter Day, and a candlelit dinner.
Prices are from #90 per person, including three nights' half-board
accommodation.
* VISITORS taking in Easter at the Spread Eagle Hotel (four crowns,
highly commended) in Thame, Oxfordshire, will be invited to hunt for
antiques during the hotel's own tenth-anniversary antiques fair (April
14-15) and browse at similar fairs in the area.
The price of #144.95 includes two nights' accommodation, breakfast,
lunch and dinner on Good Friday, and dinner on Easter Saturday.
Entrance is also included to the Stowe and Sterling antiques fairs and
the hotel's management will advise guests on where to search out
specific items.
* THE fifth Weston-super-Helidays show featuring 50 military and civil
helicopters takes place at Weston-super-Mare Beach Lawns on July 29-30.
Complementing the event will be military displays, an on-stage variety
show, and entertainment and market stalls along the seafront. Helicopter
enthusiasts will be able to ride as well as watch with pleasure flights
available at #15.
* BOTH Exmoor and the Lake District have ''safari'' packages to help
visitors make the most of the national parks in the company of experts
-- and whatever the weather.
The Moorland Rover operation aims to bring the countryside to life
with holiday packages and one-day excursions under enticing banners such
as Exmoor Explorer, Tarka Country, Two Moors Tour (Dartmoor and Exmoor),
and Glorious Gardens.
The full holidays are generally six nights and centred on Barnstaple,
Dulverton, Lynton, or Chagford. Prices depend on the standard of
selected accommodation chosen and range from #195 for four nights to
#385 for six.
All holidays feature fully-guided mini-coach trips and entrance fees
were applicable. Contact Stephen Rees-Jones on 0598 760523.
Visitors to the Lake District can go on safari to discover the
region's history and character with Lakeland Safari Tours. Full-day
tours for up to six people cost #21 each and evening tours are set at
#7.50.
* ASK travel guru Arthur Frommer if there's a place in the world he'd
still like to visit and he's unlikely to mention any ordinary holiday
spot.
The writer, generally acknowledged as America's foremost travel
authority, reveals his choice -- but admits it will be a challenge to
get there: ''I would love to go to the Antarctic, but I can't persuade
my wife to go -- she's so worried about the cold!''
Visiting far-off lands is a way of life for Frommer. There are now
more than 150 Frommer's guides covering almost every continent. The
author, in Britain this month to publicise publication of the latest
guides in the series, has a simple philosophy on the subject which has
made him famous: ''It is my belief that the less you spend, the more you
enjoy. You should travel on a budget, not out of necessity, but out of
choice. I believe in do-it-yourself, unpretentious travel.''
Frommer, who lives in New York when he's not on the move, says there
is one thing he loathes -- the type of travel American and Japanese
tourists are renowned for. And that is taking whistle-stop trips into
which they try to cram as many ''sights'' as possible in the shortest
time.
''What I don't believe in is simply going to a destination for the
purpose of sightseeing. If all you are going to do when you travel is
look at some sterile, dead, physical sight, then why travel? You can see
the Eiffel Tower as well in the pages of a picture book as in reality.''
He comments: ''I have always believed in travelling unpretentiously
and cheaply and using establishments that are not at the top of the
price scale. I have always liked staying in family-run places where I
have enjoyed some of the happiest moments of my travelling. I think a
lot of people are frightened to go to a hotel which doesn't have a huge
lobby.''
* MARLON Brando has won a legal battle to protect his private Tahitian
atoll from an unwelcome tourist invasion. A Tahitian court has ordered a
local entrepreneur who set up a floating hotel on Tetiaroa island's
lagoon to vacate the premises before Friday.
Once the playground for Tahitian royalty, Tetiaroa now hosts a
sanctuary for thousands of sea birds as well as the ageing actor.
Hotelier Teiki Pambrun, who has been putting up an estimated 6000
guests a year, faces a fine of #3400 a day if he fails to comply.
Pambrun said he plans to comply with the ruling but regrets it will
cause the loss of a dozen jobs.
Tetiaroa, which Brando bought in the 1960s, is one of 115 islands that
make up French Polynesia.
* BRITISH Airways has resumed service to Lebanon after a 12-year gap.
The airline, which suspended services to Lebanon during the 1975-90
civil war, will fly to Beirut twice weekly. British Mediterranean, a
privately-owned, single-aircraft airline, already flies to Beirut five
times weekly. Some 27 foreign airlines now serve Lebanon in addition to
the national carrier Middle East Airlines and Lebanon's cargo carrier,
Trans Mediterranean Airlines.

THE world of finance is currently the source of our best news stories,
reinforcing the impression that banks are like sewers: although they
disgust us, we know we can't do without them. The Barings scandal may
lead us to believe that the banks are interested solely in making huge
profits from the international money markets. This is obviously not the
case, as they especially love to bleed the ordinary customer dry.
I remember the days when banks were oases of calm in the average high
street. Walk in, fill in form, present passbook, carry out transaction,
leave, end of story. The staff would certainly not have told you to take
care, and would in no way have advised you on what sort of day you
should have.
It's all so complicated nowadays. It's there's a lot more to it than
just the deposit or current accounts now, you know. They've all got
names like Super Gold Saver Bonus Rich Git Savers Account. These are the
only ones with an interest rate higher than Aberdeen airport's overnight
temperature, and they always need a prolonged period of notice before
any money can be withdrawn. In these situations a counter assistant is
trained to play the maternal role. (Look, do you really need this money?
Let's wait until Christmas then we'll see. You'll certainly not get a
penny while your room's in that state!)
Things are so much better since the introduction of the cash card.
Never again will we have to go through the drudgery of carrying a large
unwieldy passbook into the bank. You don't even need to go into the
bank. Now you just stand outside in the rain while some cretin takes 20
minutes to withdraw #5. By the time it gets to your turn, you're so
annoyed you've forgotten your own number. This is because every cashcard
number has been chosen by top psychologists for its instant
forgettability. Why does no-one have a number like 1234 or 2468, or any
number that is in any way memorable. They're only memorable to those
with a degree in number theory.
They try to claim that customers prefer cash machines. This would be
true if they were fun to use. The computerised responses should be more
varied. On a Monday morning, you would get the curt service we're used
to. Late on a Friday, however, the machine would go into Office Night
Out mode. (Here, you, that's the third time you've got your number
wrong. Have another go. Nah, nah, nah. Wrong again. Here, sod it. Have
the cash anyway. In fact, have an extra fiver. See you later!)
One problem banks don't like to acknowledge is the subject of ''ghost
withdrawals'', people complaining that money has been withdrawn without
their card being used. With typical arrogance, the banks maintain that
ATMs are foolproof; I can't believe that about any machine. We go
through a toaster every six months, and you know how easy it is to toast
bread. God knows how long they'd last if they had to start remembering
who put the bread in, whether it was pan or plain, and how many slices
they toasted. Machines are never perfect, they're just slightly better
at completing boring tasks without losing concentration, that's all.
Computers have become part of all our daily lives, cutting down the
time taken to carry out complicated tasks such as calculus or spending
money in the amusement arcade. Banks are computerised, so why do we
still have to wait three working weeks before they allow you access to
the proceeds of a cheque? I wouldn't mind, but they always make it sound
as if they're doing it for your own good, as if the money has to go into
quarantine, and they're protecting you from a deadly #20 note infection.
If you ever feel somewhat aggrieved at a bank's behaviour, they have
provided a complaints procedure. These special arrangements allow you to
speak to the branch's deafest teller through a tiny plastic grille,
ensuring that you have to shout your personal business as loud as a
football chant, after which you will shrivel in embarrassment, give up,
go away, and never question the bank again, OK? If the deaf teller is
unavailable, you will see the stupidest one. She will loudly repeat
everything you say, emphasising that it was the cheque for Big Viv's
Massage Parlour which put your account into the red for eight
nanoseconds. After three hours of torture, the deaf one will have
returned from lunch, and you will have to start all over again.
In the TSB last week, I saw this complaints system in action, and was
happy to note that it stalls when dealing with an irate old woman. Old
women lack a capacity for embarrassment, which perhaps explains their
taste in headgear. Irate old women are less embarrassment-prone; they
could remain unabashed while going to church in the type of hat favoured
as national dress in the Caribbean. The IOW probably lectures at the
Open University Strop Management Summer School, and you had to admire
her skill. She repeated the teller's inanities in the most indignant
fashion, exasperating the entire branch so much that she obtained a
complete refund of the charge in question. It says much for the public's
attitude to bankers that we virtually gave her a round of applause.
Bank charges are the biggest bugbear. The banks are known as clearing
banks, because of their ability to clear accounts of entire countries
solely by applying the full charges for their services. I heard a story
which I am assured is absolutely true. The bank refuse to confirm it, so
I've changed the name to protect the avaricious. Some chap in England
was so annoyed at the bank charging #30 for being #10 overdrawn for a
whole day, that he changed his name by deed poll to ''Yorkshire County
Bank Are A Bunch of Miserable Bastards''. Honestly, the next letter they
sent him began ''Dear Mr Bastards . . .''
I don't mind that banks charge you for the most minute tasks, nor even
that they charge more money per second than an Italian striker. It's the
inevitability of the charges. During a recent remortgage, the bank
charged us an ''administration fee'' for -- seriously -- not setting up
home insurance. Heaven help us if this catches on. (Yes sir, I know
eight quid for a pint is expensive, but I've had to charge you the ''Not
Having a Cocktail'' levy.)
I've had my day. Whenever I get annoyed at the banks, I just think
back to the day when Big Ilesy and I each handed the other's ''lost''
card into the bank. (Some years ago, for your honesty, you received a #5
note as reward.) We bought a case of beer with the proceeds. The banks
are more hard headed than they used to be, and the world's a worse place
for that -- just ask any Third World Finance Minister.

The Herald's reviewers offer an informed tour around the latest sounds
in pop, rock, and jazz.
POP/ROCK
Conversation Peace, Stevie Wonder (Motown)
* Creamy-smooth contemporary r&amp;b stylings. Lush, adult-oriented
power-balladry. Social comment about crack and gang warfare. Pleas for
global harmony. But where are the flipping songs? Asks Stevie: ''Are you
ready to step off the edge into eternity? Really, really ready to step
off the edge into eternity? 'Cause if you're ready to step off the edge
into eternity, we can step right off the edge into eternity.'' Not with
rotten lyrics like this we sodding can't, mate.
The American Ruse, MC5 (Total Energy)
* Dedicated to the blessed memories of departed Motor City 5 legends
Rob Tyner and Fred ''Sonic'' Smith, this new CD hypes itself as ''the
pre-production rehearsals for Back In The USA, recorded in July, 1969,
before the producer had completely stripped the band of their power''.
This claim is open to debate, but if you're hip to incendiary
rock'n'roll, you'll have to invest in The American Ruse as a
companion-piece to all the MC5 albums you've got already . . . and if
you don't have every MC5 album already, it's time to wise up, sucker.
Cerebral Caustic, the Fall (Permanent)
* ''Go back, go back to your disease-control room!'' is narky Mark E
Smith's opening injunction, delivered in withering Mancunian tones to an
uplifting sneerabilly back-beat. But hark, Mark: you are our disease --
and thankfully your art is beyond rational control. The Fall are
unstoppable; essentially unchanging; unbending, and unfathomable. Unload
your wallet in their direction.
King For A Day Fool For A Lifetime, Faith No More (Slash)
* Shouty, weedy, stop-go adolescent thrash-metal from the suburbs of
Dullsville, Iowa. Be warned, parents whose musical tastes were formed in
the sixties! Your children's prolonged over-exposure to Jethro Tull
albums can result in horrifyingly-earnest bombast-rock just like this!
Cha Cha Cha, EMF (Parlophone)
* Crunching and mesmeric hard-rock a la mode o'erlain with a dreamy
topping of Anglo-pop feyness, courtesy of winsome vocalist Derry
Brownson. A lot of album for your money, and while it may not bring
former teeny-idols EMF the artistic credibility they deserve, it should
be embraced by the open-minded.
DAVID BELCHER
JAZZ
Concerto for Joe, Joe Temperley (Hep)
* Seven typically spruce quartet treatments of mainly Ellington and
Monk tunes prelude the main event. His final work, The Concerto,
particularly the ballad A Day At A Time, is testament to the fact that
as a writer Jimmy Deuchar was up there with jazz's greats. Temperley's
baritone saxophone, with its slightly ravaged grace, is just the
instrument to articulate this epitaph.
Time Will Tell, Paul Bley, Evan Parker, Barre Phillips (ECM)
* An intriguing first meeting between pianist Bley and saxophonist
Parker, with bassist Phillips (who has worked with both players
separately) mediating between Bley's refined, logical approach to
instant composition and Parker's more robust free flights. The few
occasions when it doesn't quite gel are assuaged by the wonderful tones
all three produce on their instruments.

MANCHESTER United have received the go-ahead to redevelop Old Trafford
and push the capacity up to 55,300 -- with the highlight a triple-decker
stand.
The club have agreed to pay #9.2m to Trafford Park Estates -- subject
to shareholders' approval -- for 20 acres of land next to the ground.
That land will be used to rebuild and extend the North stand in a
project costing #18.65m, making United's ground capacity the highest in
England.
Work will begin at the end of this season and it is expected to be
completed the following May, in time for the UEFA Championship finals.
United's current capacity is 43,000 and they have found it impossible
to meet the ticket demands of their fans. The champions and FA Cup
holders currently have 127,000 members in supporters clubs scattered
worldwide.
The deal was finally completed early yesterday after months of
negotiations. United's finance director, Robin Launders, said: ''It is
great news for the fans. We know this is what they have wanted for a
long time.
''Hopefully we will have the work completed by the time of the UEFA
Championships, when we are one of the host clubs.
''But if not, everything will be in place by the start of the 1996-97
season.''
United shareholders will meet next month and they are expected to give
their seal of approval to the deal.

CHILDREN are our copy, in little. In Pol Pot's Cambodia they denounced
their own families. In affluent Western culture they wail for expensive
trainers like their friends.
Children mirror the society that nurtures them, or fails to, more
accurately than anything else, including opinion polls. If the mirror is
a distorting one, the monsters we see in it are still ourselves.
Neglect, incest, molestation, violence in families have always taken
place. Never have more attempts been made, often with appalling
clumsiness, to save children from their violators.
Yet, paradoxically, we have watched the quality of their lives
deteriorate for a good 15 years in this country; one of the
fastest-growing groups living in poverty are children. How we treat them
really tests who we are and conveys who we hope to be. Now children, far
from holding up the lit lamp of hope like the small girl in Picasso's
Guernica, have become the focus of ever greater anxiety and horror.
The Christian moral tradition has always held an ambivalent view of
childhood: Christ's plea to Suffer the Little Children and worship of
God as a baby in a manger, while simultaneously teaching the inherent
sinfulness of the child. As Hilaire Belloc's hilarious parody of
Catholic teaching with his comic gallery of rogues, like Matilda -- who
told such dreadful lies, it made one gasp and stretch one's eyes -- and
is consumed by flames, reveals.
The injured child has become an icon of humanity. Charities forced to
compete for funds resort to ever more explicit images of maimed,
starving, diseased, and doomed infants to raise money.
It's no accident that Les Miserables inspired a theatrical smash with
the use of a starveling, saucer-eyed waif, staring out from the poster
to draw thousands to the musical. Darkly, the face of James Bulger
became the haunting image of present horrors and social failures, his
innocence an appeal and an accusation.
When it does go wrong, when the child fails to live out innocent life
on behalf of adults, when they can't be the living embodiments of
adults' inner goodness, the results are callous and punitive. The shock
of James Bulger's death was deepened by his murderers' ages, but their
trial revealed a brutal absence of pity for them as children, conducted
as if they were adults. They had betrayed an abstract myth about
children's proper childlikeness.
When a disturbed woman began pestering social workers with lurid tales
of ritual and obscene abuse, it was at a time when the social work
profession was on the alert for sex-crazed black magicians. Five years
on, those who may have begun with the best of motives are exposed as
bunglers and the case is discredited in court. The children remain
victims. Left to pick up the pieces of broken lives.
That adults dress up, do drugs, and terrorise children is no longer a
surprise to doctors, police, social workers, although it remains
problematic for the criminal courts. The investigative imagination and
resources devoted to cocaine smuggling or armed robbery has yet to
provide us with a model to deal with the idea of adults doing weird
stuff to children.
The children's charity, the Royal Scottish Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, is planning a radical switch in strategy. Its
income has been in freefall over the past four years, partly blamed on
its controversial role in the Orkney child sex abuse case. It will
concentrate on preventive work.
Is the cruelty man still needed? Sadly, yes. Maybe not in a uniform,
maybe not in the shape of the bogey man of collective memory who came to
carry away the grubby, wailing children of parents who could not cope.
But because we have not learned how to protect our children.
This week, we hear that the number of Lothian children referred to the
children's reporter on grounds of abuse or lack of parental care last
year rose by 18%, while there was a 27% increase in sexual abuse cases.
The reform of local government means bureaucracy will ensnare social
workers in the break-up and reformation of new authorities. The old
cruelty man with a new name may, ironically, acquire by force of
circumstance a pivotal role in child care.
The ''ah-bless-em'' days of shoving a pound in a collecting tin, a
cop-out for real societal duties, may be on the way back.
We can pretend that all children except those of a disadvantaged
vicious minority are tenderly cherished. We can go on deluding
ourselves. But societies get the children they deserve. Our children
can't be better than we are.

DOLLY said: ''Cut the crap and level with me''. All right, we will:
She's Out (ITV, Monday) suddenly took a sharp turn for the better by the
simple expedient of allowing brief actions to speak louder than dull
words. Given that Lynda La Plante's words remain on the wrong side of
the great divide from memorable, this was a smart move for a thriller.
The team put their foot to the floor and suddenly the quest for Dolly's
diamonds began to make dramatic, if not actual, sense.
Pleasingly, the women themselves started to acquire the substance that
comes from character rather than spurious ''motivation''. Each was
allowed the glimpse of a private life -- one visiting the old man in the
nick, another beaten by her pimp, a third lying to her genteel old
mother -- and you could only wonder why La Plante hadn't thought of it
sooner. Drama flows from what people are, not what they do.
You wouldn't want to say the same about Harry (BBC1, Wednesday), least
of all if the egregious anti-hero was earwigging. Michael Elphick is
still struggling manfully with the part of Salter, and there is nothing
wrong with the cast, but the show's continuing willingness slowly to
build layers of verisimilitude and then blow them away, like a careless
child with a sand-castle, is maddening. What Harry is -- shifty, lying,
addicted to the tabloid game -- is clear enough. What he does stands in
clear, but deeply silly, contradiction.
Thus, this week's complicated farrago involving a crazed veteran of a
Northern Ireland army assassination squad turned on a woman's refuge.
The point, in press terms, of such places is that you never, ever
identify their location, least of all by printing pictures of them. So
what did Harry do? Had he failed to make an error entirely out of
keeping with his grizzled, seasoned-old-hack persona the plot would have
stopped cold; that he did so made the grizzled etcetera appear like
thin, unconvincing make-up.
None of this has anything to do with a writer's ability to turn a
decent line and everything to do with prevailing attitudes, among TV
drama-makers, towards the couch King Edwards. Yes, they really do seem
to think you are stupid. If this was meant to be reality they could keep
it.
For that reason, perhaps, this column has developed an unhealthy
fascination with The X Files (BBC2, Thursday), a series drawing on
conspiracy theories which are widely believed that is, in itself, never
knowingly believable. Because it's a crock, knows it's a crock, but
never once lets on about its relationship with crockdom, you can watch
these deadpan excursions to Paranoia City with an untroubled mind. David
Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as FBI agents Mulder and Scully play out
the tension between scepticism (her) and credulity (him), allowing the
viewer to put his feet up and let others do the mental work.
''You seem to know something about molecular biology,'' said a
soon-to-be-terminated scientist to Scully, ''do you know what you're
looking at?'' Your reviewer didn't, not with any certainty, but that is
the essence of the show's fun. What we're going to do for lunacy until
The X Files returns in the autumn would baffle even the Bureau.
Chances are we'll be watching the fall of the west from a comfy chair.
On Monday both Panorama (BBC1) and World in Action (ITV) decided there
was no real point in waiting for the trial of Nick Leeson. One City type
was heard to say ''We regard honesty as a key criteria'', and no-one
laughed. Elsewhere it was pointed out that the boy from Barings would
not have been allowed to trade in Britain, largely because of his
criminal record.
Oh yes, this was the revelation of the hour: Nick Leeson, poll-tax
evader! Now it all becomes clear. Plainly the Barings debacle was from
the beginning a plot by a seasoned subversive to bring capitalism to its
knees.
If only . . .
Otherwise we were offered, from both programmes, a question and a
moral. The former was simple and obvious, yet asked as if it were a
poser too far: who, if anyone, can we trust with our money? The moral
was equally clear-cut, like a law to set beside Murphy's: the moment
banks say nothing can ever go wrong is exactly when things go
spectacularly, unbelievably wrong. No-one bothered to explain,
meanwhile, how Leeson can possibly expect a fair trial after this lot.
Perhaps the most interesting drama of the week, if not the most
successful, was the first of the Lambrusco Nights trilogy (BBC2,
Wednesday), Aileen Ritchie's Icing on the Cake. With Libby McArthur all
but solo as Mary, struggling with flab, contradictory male demands, and
self-doubt as she struggled to slim herself into a wedding dress two
sizes too small, this was beautifully played and beautifully written. In
reducing her weight Mary was, somehow, reducing her very self. She
didn't want to be fat but she didn't know what, or rather who, she
really wanted to be.
The comedy was bitter, sharp and truthful. It dealt with a species of
oppression habitually given a glib, self-satisfied treatment by people
like Dawn French, determined to make fat a fashion statement. Icing the
Cake didn't need to be staged as a mock video diary, however, and the
device became both irritating and a distraction from McArthur's
performance.

<HEADLINE>AAH fights German bid</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979337376</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AAH, the drug wholesaler with a 300-strong chain of pharmacies,
yesterday accused German takeover bidder Gehe of trying to buy the
company on the cheap.
Gehe launched its hostile #377.4m last month after AAH warned of a
profits setback in its non-core waste disposal business.
Chairman John Padovan said as AAH despatched its defence document to
shareholders, ''Gehe is trying to get shareholders' assets on the cheap
with a cut-price bid for market leadership. This is an opportunistic
offer which is clearly inadequate and fails to recognise the underlying
value of the AAH business.''
The document contains the expected AAH foreast for the year ending
March 31, 1995, showing operating profit of #34.3m, pre-tax profits of
#29m and adjusted earnings per share of 21.5p.
Mr Padovan said the offer ignored the fact that AAH's principal
healthcare businesses continued to perform well and would benefit
further from the current rationalisation and cost-cutting programmes.
Lincoln-based AAH, which is urging investors to reject the Gehe offer,
said the board expected to recommend a maintained final dividend for the
year to March 31 of 11.9p per share.
Gehe, for its part, said the AAH document offered its shareholders
little more than vague and unquantified promises for the future.
AAH's share price currently stands at 432p compared to Gehe's bid of
420p a share so the market thinks there may be a little more to be
squeezed out of the German pharmaceutical company.

Fundamental to a democratic society is an active and interested
citizenry, something which seems to be fast declining, argues
Iain Scollay
IT'S said that there's nothing like politics to get a discussion
going. Politics can transform a pleasant, casual chat into a fiery and
heated debate. I remember frequent warnings before family dinner parties
not to mention the topic of Scottish Nationalism as one guest in
particular had more than a modest interest in this issue. Of course, if
this topic made it on to the evening's agenda it invariably turned out
to be the most entertaining (and volatile) part of the proceedings.
This is the sort of debate which can create sworn adversaries out of
long-standing acquaintances and unleash hidden passions in the most
timid of company. As it affects us all so profoundly, isn't politics a
subject of immense importance which should be discussed frequently and
fervently?
I consider myself lucky; I was brought up on a near nightly diet of
political discussion. However, in my more recent experience, I've found
that far from being a topic that engages people, politics is fast
becoming a supremely effective conversational turn-off.
An American comedian once remarked how it was too bad that all the
people who knew how to run the country were busy driving cabs and
cutting hair. Not so any more. I've asked, and even our taxi drivers and
barbers don't feel too inclined to comment.
As far as I can tell the political debate is drying up as quickly as
the Prime Minister at question time. While politicians and newspapers go
through the motions, fewer people subscribe. Traditional political
orthodoxies have a declining number of believers.
Moreover, in order to cover this growing dissatisfaction and political
atheism, substance is being replaced by spin. Appearances take priority
over ideas and conservatism over the slightest threat of radicalism.
Negative campaigns prove more successful than positive ones. Previously
respected office-holders sink to unprecedented levels of disrepute.
What seems to be declining is the public's confidence in traditional
institutions and the ideas upon which these are based. And this is
occurring as the role of the individual within society is becoming more
confused. Less and less can people see a benefit in collective action
and public service. Individuals seem to find it more difficult to
consider the benefits of strategic action, and to look any further than
their immediate life.
How many people today express a respect for the work of politicians?
How many see the point in voting at European or council elections? How
many feel inclined to join a political party or stand for their local
council? And, regardless of the present debate, how many believe that
ideas such as a commitment to full employment can succeed?
Numerous commentators are warning of the serious implications of
politics in what has been described as an antipolitical age. In the
aftermath of the collapse of communism in 1989 there was a wave of
self-congratulation from the devotees of the democratic system.
Experience and experimentation had proved that liberal democracy was the
most efficient way of representing and governing people.
Of course we should be proud of many of the principles upon which our
country and a large part of the world are now based, but such
celebration may distract us from a new set of equally serious problems.
Communism and fascism have been banished -- leaving behind an
extraordinary death toll -- and democracy is now widely recognised as
the universally correct form of social organisation.
Yet this assumption will increasingly ring hollow as we begin to dwell
upon our own predicament. If we are entering an antipolitical age, then
the rejuvenation and reinvention of democracy is a critical task. The
alternative is that we will once again fall foul of less tolerant and
more extreme ideas.
Every age and every political system has its problems. Today's most
threatening development seems to be the lack of popular involvement in
our political system.
Fundamental to a democratic society is an active and interested
citizenry, something which seems to be fast declining. While the high
turn-out at recent General Elections would initially suggest a healthy
and interested population, it is doubtful whether this reflects the
present reality. For a large number of people politics is simply
becoming the opportunity to participate for only one day in every five
years.
Moreover, many are voting with the opinion that the make-up of their
constituency means that the result is a foregone conclusion. This means
that the electorate's only hope in the interim is to petition, march,
subscribe, lobby, protest, and above all remain involved and interested.
Instead of this it seems that large numbers are preferring to switch off
or over.
I was eight when the Conservative Party came to power. I sympathise
with those of my generation of an alternative political hue to today's
Government. Providing an election does not occur before 1997, Britain
will have had to wait 18 years to witness an alternative government.
From a Scottish perspective, the length and intractability of
Conservatism can only succeed in fanning the frustration and cynicism of
those in opposition.
Although my experience is limited, I believe that there has been an
observable and growing disaffection with the leaders of our nation and
the affairs of government. And this is more than just an antipathy for
the Government of the day.
This dissatisfaction is born out of a feeling of powerlessness -- that
the bureaucratic cogs of big business and government will turn
relentlessly, regardless of the efforts of the individual. Moreover,
there seems a consensus that those foolish enough to attempt to
influence them are quickly co-opted and corrupted. This attitude is also
more than simply being a Scottish or British phenomenon. Similar
problems are being experienced in America and indeed throughout the
developed world.
Along with addressing this feeling of powerlessness and declining
participation we must also consider some of the flaws and anachronisms
of the British parliamentary system. As ever the House of Commons is
still dominated by older, affluent, educated men. Is it any wonder that
people become disillusioned when our representatives are anything but
representative of the population?
And I wonder how long we can go on shredding the reputations of our
public figures and scouring their past for scandal. Many would reply
that this will continue only as long as these figures continue to act in
an unsuitable manner. However, even in the light of the numerous recent
scandals could it not be that we are actually placing more demands
morally and personally on these individuals? As traditional rhetoric
becomes less convincing, one way of holding our officials to account
other than examining their political manifestos is to question their
personal morality.
Is it really the case that today's leaders are any less deserving of
respect than their forefathers? The ancient Greeks offered us the first
definition of an idiot as someone who considers himself to be above
politics. Yet, how many of us today would agree with such a description?
And how many would offer it as a definition for those in, rather than
above, politics?
President Clinton faces a similarly dissatisfied electorate and an
equally probing media. Moreover, Clinton's presidency has been
significantly undermined by allegations over his personal life. If
previous Presidents had operated in a similar moral climate they too
would have been equally weakened. For example, if we are to believe the
stories of JFK's alleged philandering, then Kennedy in his day made
''Slick Willie'' appear a veritable choirboy. Yet in Kennedy's era this
darker personal side was not deemed to interfere with his work as
President and went largely unreported.
One of the most concerning developments of this antipolitical age is
the effect that it must be having upon young and first-time voters. The
youth of our country seem to be steadily turning away from traditional
politics towards alternative issues and areas such as the environment,
animal rights, and sexual politics. These areas rather than the
traditional political arena seem to offer the young a principle worth
fighting for and the belief that a person's effort may have an effect.
While youth party memberships remain low there has been a steady
increase in the membership of organisations such as Amnesty
International and Greenpeace.
Admittedly, those aged 18-25 have traditionally been less likely to
vote. But the 18-25 group has also traditionally been one of the most
radical and dynamic groups, and contains the next generation of
politicians, industrialists, and leaders. If this generation were
allowed to inherit a similar disaffection towards politics this would
surely be tremendously detrimental to our future prosperity.
The universities and colleges of our country have always been fertile
breeding grounds for all manner of activist. Yet the principal of
Glasgow University felt it necessary recently to encourage graduates to
get involved in politics. He argued that there is an increasing contempt
for public servants and a decline in the number of graduates wishing to
go into this area. He explained how ''the practice of politics is a sort
of oil which prevents the machinery of government from seizing up. It is
vital to a democratic society''. Surely in years gone by such a call
would not have been necessary, and this would have been something to
which large numbers of graduates would have wished to aspire without
prompting?
Some of the blame must be levelled at the older generations. As a
relatively young voter I am often frustrated by attitudes motivated by
experiences which are outwith my memory. For example, the ''winter of
discontent argument'' is still wheeled out whenever the Labour Party
vaguely threatens to prove electable. What has been even more surprising
than a Labour victory is that these arguments still carry weight!
Today's Labour Party bears little resemblance to that of the 70s.
Surely, regardless of the considerable problems encountered in that
period, it is time to forget?
It is incredibly frustrating for a generation of new voters to be told
that the only viable political alternative is unelectable because of a
period of which you have absolutely no memory. Then, to make matters
worse, as the Labour Party attempts to make itself more appealing by
moving away from old ideas, it is accused of cynical expediency and
deserting old principles.
I am not necessarily suggesting that Labour provides the best
solution. I am suggesting that our system would benefit from a credible
Opposition party. With the present watershed in the Labour Party, we
should banish from the discussion tired opinions; we should search for
new solutions.
Regardless of the problems that our country faces, they should not be
insurmountable. Nor should they be enough to deter new blood from
seeking office in order to try to make a difference. Rather than being
carved in stone, ours is a system that is based upon the efforts of its
citizens and its ability to change.
In a similar way political parties must be allowed to adapt and
develop, and can do so only as the result of an active and healthy
debate. New ideas must be embraced and more attention given to
attracting the brightest and best of the younger generation. Above all,
we must once again reward and admire our public servants and hope that
they can repay this faith for the sake of all.
And while not everyone wishes to aspire to the council chamber or the
House of Commons, we can all still do our bit to rekindle the political
debate. Therefore, at your next dinner party, please indulge your
outspoken guest -- every party has one. And let your taxi driver and
your barber know that if they need to blow off steam, you're there for
them.

STERLING was again a victim of the rampaging mark yesterday. For the
third time in a week it posted fresh lows against the German currency
and dropped below DM2.20 for the first time ever.
The Italian lira and the Irish punt, dragged down by the pound, also
hit new lows against the Deutschmark, and the French franc, Spanish
peseta and Portuguese escudo were in deep trouble.
The lira is in free-fall despite Prime Minister Lamberto Dini's narrow
victory in a key confidence vote on Thursday, and in Milan one currency
trader said: ''I have seen people in tears today.''
Within Europe's exchange rate mechanism only the Dutch guilder and the
Austrian schilling can keep up with the mighty mark, which is one of
just three international currencies for which there is any real demand.
(The others are the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.)
On Thursday the Bundesbank dashed what lingering hopes there were that
it would lend a helping hand by reducing its key interest rates. The
mark has been irrepressible since, and hints yesterday by the central
bank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, that a small cut in German rates was
''not impossible'' did nothing to stem the tide.
Speaking in Stockholm, Tietmeyer also said that the mark ''was
slightly overvalued against some currencies''.
The Bundesbank does not enjoy much of a reputation as a friendly
neighbour, and analysts remain sceptical that it would relax monetary
policy. On the few occasions in the past when it has appeared to respond
to international pressures, it has usually been a matter of too little
too late.
Paring a few points off its repo rate but leaving its discount and
Lombard rates unchanged would be a typical response to the current
crisis.
Recent potentially inflationary wage deals in the engineering and
banking sectors have given central bankers in Frankfurt an excuse to
stay their hands on interest rates.
A strong currency is often taken as a sign of international financial
virility, but it creates domestic problems, notably for exporters.
Already there are clear signs that the long-standing strength of the
yen is holding back the recovery of the Japanese economy. Germany could
soon find itself in the same boat.
In late trading the pound managed to claw its way back over DM2.19 to
end European trading with a loss of over 2.5 pfennigs at DM2.1903. It
lost threequarters-of-a-cent to $1.5820. The dollar managed to keep its
head above water as the mark conquered all else before it.
Sterling's trade-weighted index dropped back from 84.6 to 84.4, and is
now just 0.4 above its all-time low in February 1993 at the height of
the currency turmoil following the pound's forced exit from the ERM.
So far this year sterling has lost 4.6% of its international value,
equivalent to a reduction of over 1% in base rates. Against the mark the
loss is much greater at 9.7%.
Against the Swiss franc the pound's decline exceeds 11%. A lunchtime
calculation by Reuters showed losses of 6% against the escudo, 5.4%
against the French franc and 1.1% against the peseta. The only
consolation in Europe is a 5.9% gain against the lira.
The root cause of this year's currrency upheaval has been the weakness
of the dollar against the yen and the mark. The pound has in fact
managed to gain 0.9% against the dollar, though in the last two weeks it
has fallen back from over $1.65.
Most fragile currencies, especially in Europe, are victims of the
clash between the dollar and the mark, though some such as sterling and
the lira have displayed independent weakness for a combination of
political and financial reasons.
The pound's plight has not been helped by constant reminders of the
Government's political failures and by the perception that the economy
is slowing down. This has removed sterling's interest-rate prop and left
it friendless on foreign exchange markets.
A weak currency gives rise to inflationary pressures, initially
because it raises the cost of imports, and later because it can create
bottlenecks in manufacturing as exports take off on the back of it.

A WORD of advice from Couch Potato to all deranged master criminals,
world-domination wannabees, and movie megalomaniacs in general: when you
want to bump people off, keep it simple and do it in person.
Dear old Fu Manchu loved to rattle his fingernails evilly as Nayland
Smith of Scotland Yard was lowered slowly into a pit of giant centipedes
or whatever, and all the villains in the Bond series got much mileage
out of the line Goodbye . . . Mr Bond as our hero was strapped to a
table with a laser beam inching towards his vitals -- or whatever -- but
in practice such imaginative forms of execution always proved more
picturesque than effective. Before you could say With one bound Jack was
free, Jack was free, and the perpetually surprised bad guys were right
behind the eight ball.
This advice didn't get through to mad bomber Dennis Hopper (Yo! Bold
casting!) in time for Speed (rental, cert 15); otherwise we could have
been spared 101 minutes of the company of the least sympathetic bunch of
group-jeopardy supporting players since the entire cast of The Towering
Inferno. On the other hand, we'd have missed one of the most skilful,
inventive, and single-mindedly action-driven tubs of brain popcorn since
the Die Hard movies.
Dippy Dennis, you see, has put a bomb on a bus in a fit of pique at
the failure of his recent attempt to hold a lift full of office workers
to ransom. But being a true son of Fu Manchu, Ming the Merciless, and
Auric Goldfinger, he can't just have it blow up the minute the driver
turns on the ignition; any amateur could do that. This bomb is so rigged
that it only goes off when the bus slows to less than 50 miles an hour
-- which, in city traffic, means everyone's dead.
Or they would be, if not for heroic LA SWAT cop Keanu Reeves and
feisty passenger Sandra Bullock, who takes over at the wheel when the
driver makes an early exit. From here on in, nothing -- secondary
storylines, romance, characterisation, plausibility, trash like that --
is allowed to interfere with the unrelenting tension and spectacular
incident of a first-class thrill ride that works more extravagant twists
and variations into its striking but simple premise than Couch Potato
would have thought posible.
Readers of Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will
remember that Huck's pal Tom Sawyer shared the great movie villains'
inability to do anything prosaically, especially when it came to getting
Huck's slave friend Jim out of durance vile. However, that's among the
plot elements left to float down the Mississippi in Stephen Sommers's
The Adventures Of Huck Finn (rental, cert PG).
More than any previous version, this one gives Jim the runaway slave
(Courtney Vance) a fair shake in terms of characterisation and sheer
humanity, and explores more deeply the contradictions of the
automatically racist Southern boy Huck Finn's friendship with him.
A particular attraction is the presence of Robbie Coltrane -- who
seems doomed to give his best comic performances in obscure American
films that don't get into British cinemas -- alongside Jason Robards as
the rascally and rambunctious strolling players and self-proclaimed
European nobility who leech on to Huck and Jim on their journey down Old
Man River.
Just room, we hope, to mention the release of Lewis Milestone's
crucial 1965 gem Alfie (retail, cert 15) at the bargain price of #5.99
from 4-Front Video. It might not be the best British film of the 1960s,
but it's surely the most 1960s film of the 1960s. Cockney working-class
hero, straight-to-camera monologues, sexual ''liberation'', seedy London
interiors, a Sonny Rollins jazz score, an arty credits sequence, a
killer title song, a cameo role for Shelley Winters . .  what more,
apart from a mint original mono copy of the Beatles album Rubber Soul,
could any 1960s buff (eg Couch Potato) want?
It also features Michael Caine in his best performance in his best
film, a role that turned him from a starlet into a style icon. His name
is Michael Caine.

Film director Antonia Bird is sending shock waves through the movie
world with her hard-hitting new work about a homosexual priest. Here Bob
Flynn looks at the influences which shaped the woman who started by
running away to join the theatre
IN THE beginning, there was Brookside and EastEnders. While Brookside
Close was under construction in the early eighties, a young Liverpudlian
began writing what became a string of 80 episodes. The writer was Jimmy
McGovern and, long before Cracker and Hearts And Minds made him the
Bleasdale for the nineties, he was pushing to introduce a story about a
priest who falls in love against the backdrop of casino economics and
the death of communities.
In the meantime, Antonia Bird, a young woman director out of the East
End, fresh from a series of hard-hitting social dramas at the Royal
Court Theatre, was beginning to make waves on the new rival soap,
EastEnders.
Almost a decade later, the writer and director joined forces in what
seems a predestined collaboration to create Priest, a film about a
crusading priest in post-Thatcher Liverpool. Even in these days of
Natural Born scatter-gun cinema, Priest is a thrilling shock, with Linus
Roache mesmerising in the lead role of the new priest whose homosexual
love for a local man (played by Scot Robert Carlyle) leaves him racked
with guilt while the terrible weight of a teenage girl's revelations, in
the unbreakable secrecy of the confessional, of her father's incestuous
abuse causes a personal crisis of faith which resonates through the
parish.
After adulatory screenings at last year's Edinburgh Festival, Toronto,
Sundance and Berlin, the film was bought by the hard-nosed American
Miramax outfit who will soon open Bird and McGovern's debut theatrical
feature with one of their largest first-run distributions in the US. For
a film about a gay priest in Liverpool, that's high corn. Is Antonia
Bird happy? Is she hell!
''Tell me about your childhood,'' I demand of Bird, sounding, I
suddenly realise, like McGovern's Fitz. ''Oh, you don't want to know
about it,'' says Bird, still jet-lagged after another flight back from
Los Angeles where she was finishing work on Mad Love, her new film
starring Drew Barrymore and Chris O'Donnell as teenage lovers on the
run. But I do, I insist, it's important to know where someone who can
make a film about religion so electrifying is coming from. She thinks
for a moment before replying, then avoids the question -- but kind of
answers it.
''The thing is, when I was first handed the script and told it was
about a gay Catholic priest I wondered why the hell they were giving it
to me. I'm not Catholic, I'm not gay and I'm a girl! And the whole thing
about the Church I found a little scary. I hadn't been since I was
eleven. But the script kicked me in the gut.''
Like Dawn French in bovver boots, Bird is large, humorous and twinkly,
but also tenacious and stubborn. When she arrived on the Mad Love set
and discovered that the crew were employed on a non-union rate basis,
(ie on the cheap), she told the corporate American suits to ''f*** off''
and demanded union conditions. She got them. Her favourite phrase is
''digging my heels in'' and, when she makes up her mind, she locks the
brakes. But she is also the most talented British director of recent
times, bar none, and Priest is a dazzling confirmation of the promise of
her first feature, Safe, which was like watching a Ken Loach version of
Dante among London's homeless.
And she is compassionate. It shines through the screen that she is
making films about issues she genuinely cares about. Okay, do you want
to change the world? ''I do actually,'' she says. Simple as that.
''I'd say my background was downwardly mobile,'' she says, giving in,
''My dad (Donald Bird) was an actor -- a very good one -- but he never
got much work and he ended up a bitter, disappointed man. But he had a
great influence on me. I had a very untheatrical background though and
my parents were determined that I would have nothing to do with the
theatre or films. I left school at 15 and ran away from home to join the
Coventry Rep. I eventually became a stage manager, although I always
wanted to act. Then I realised it was too humiliating to be an actor. I
think that's why I went into directing.''
So this is the girl who ran away to join the circus. But her career is
not the stuff of overnight success. It was a slow process of learning
the craft, an apprenticeship that took her, pre-EastEnders, to the Royal
Court for five years where a grounding in challenging works formed a
rare respect for writers and love of actors. She herself is a rare
thing, a British female director and, even more unusually, she has a
conscience and she's gonna use it.
''I couldn't make a film about people I didn't care about,'' she says.
When Jeffrey Katzenberg, the then chairman of Disney, of all
companies, saw Safe, of all things, he immediately signed Bird up to the
Disney subsidiary Touchstone for a three-picture deal, of which Mad Love
is the first. She admits to being a cinematic child of Ken Loach but
stylistically, her influences are more Scorsese and Hill Street Blues.
Priest is clever without being tricky, humane without being schmaltzy.
Bird knows about movement and how to trap a moment and only the best do
that.
Bird regards Priest as a personal triumph against all the odds, even
with a dazzling McGovern script. She battled for its survival. Firstly,
against drastic cuts to fit the BBC's initial TV slot and later for its
consideration as a work for cinema and its inclusion in last year's
Edinburgh Film Festival. Having said that, she had to practically
smuggle the film into the programme. Yet again, she dug her heels in.
Despite the BBC producers worriedly pacing the Filmhouse corridors --
the film was billed as ''a work in progress'' mainly due to the
insistence by the BBC, they of little faith -- Priest was the British
film discovery of the fortnight. The crowd cheered and wept, I wrote a
frantic rave about it and Priest went on to win the Michael Powell Award
for Best British Film, Bird's second Edinburgh win in a row following
the Chaplin Award for Safe. Reminiscent of the sensation caused by
Channel 4's My Beautiful Laundrette at the '85 Festival which resulted
in a theatrical release and launched Stephen Frears, Hanif Kureishi and
Daniel Day Lewis into the firmament, the Edinburgh screening initiated a
momentum which has not slowed since. Mirimax paid $1.7 million for US
distribution rights, putting the $1.3 million production into immediate
profit. The terrible irony is that after worldwide sales -- excluding
Argentina, where the distributors said they would be shot if it was
shown -- the doubting Thomases of the BBC's Sales Company are now buying
houses from the profits. In the film world there is no justice, just
money.
But Bird remains optimistic and America has not fazed her in the
slightest. She sees similar themes from her first two films in the
just-wrapped Mad Love. ''It celebrates freedom,'' she said.
''That's why I went into TV in the first place, to get a broader
audience. I think by complete luck I found my medium, which is the
camera. It's a dream for me. You can see into people's souls.''
Hallelujah, and may she go in peace . . . but I doubt it.

The world of opera lay at Isobel Buchanan's feet, until she gave it
all up to care for her family. As Alison Kerr reports, she is now ready
to launch herself again
THE last seven years have been relatively quiet for Glasgow-born
soprano Isobel Buchanan. But, if the prophecies are correct (and so far
they have been), the next few will be distinctly noisy as she launches
herself back into the opera world. For, strange as it sounds, Buchanan
was told by a medium that her career would peak again during her 42nd
year.
It was in 1987, after more than a decade in constant demand as a
leading player in productions all over the globe, that Buchanan
suddenly, and without explanation, withdrew completely from the opera
scene, and left her career in limbo. This was the first hiatus in a
non-stop 12-year rise during which the singer had juggled high-profile
parts with raising a young family. Everything in Buchanan's life -- both
her professional and her personal life -- seems to have happened so
quickly that it's not surprising that she finally, at the age of 32, had
to stop and take stock.
The career had taken off while Buchanan was still a student at the
RSAMD in Glasgow. One of her singing teachers knew opera star Joan
Sutherland and her conductor husband Richard Bonynge and asked them to
listen to the 20-year-old singer. Buchanan auditioned for them at Covent
Garden (''the one and only audition I ever really had to do'') and, as a
result, found herself being invited to join the Australian Opera Company
of which Bonynge was the newly-appointed musical director.
Buchanan finished her course; flew straight out to Australia and
straight into three-and-a-half years of singing leading roles. After
that initial audition for Bonynge, she went from one part to the next;
her British debut (as Pamina in The Magic Flute) at Glyndebourne in 1978
followed directly on from the end of her Australian contract.
Then one day Buchanan received a life-changing phone call. ''The
Vienna State Opera asked me if I knew the role of Micaela in Carmen --
in French. I said 'yes'. So they asked me if I could go over and sing it
with Placido Domingo for Franco Zeffirelli! Not only that, but the
production was to be televised live all over Europe. I was 24 and
terrified. I even kept my coat on in the dressing room because I was
sure that they'd send me home after they heard me, but Zeffirelli came
in and said: 'Wonderful -- can you do all the performances?' So I did.
And that really was the thing that shot me into another sphere.''
Domingo, in particular, did his best to put Buchanan, who joined the
company just five days before the production began, at ease. ''He was so
considerate. In fact, on my first day I went onstage and found that
everyone was already in costume. I sang the first duet with him -- just
cold -- and afterwards he shook my hand and said: 'How do you do? I'm
Placido Domingo'. I thought: 'Omigod, I know', all the time going weak
at the knees.''
As the professional life careered from success to greater success,
events in Buchanan's personal life began to gather momentum too. In 1978
while she was singing Helena in the Australian Opera Company's
production of Benjamin Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream, she met and
fell in love with the actor Jonathan Hyde who was playing Puck. Hyde is
Australian, but by a strange irony, he'd spent three years living in
Glasgow, acting at the Citizens' Theatre, while Buchanan spent the same
three years working in Australia.
They married and set up home in London. Even the birth of her first
child, Willa, in 1982 did not seriously encroach on Buchanan's work
schedule. ''She travelled everywhere with me. I zoomed across the world
with her and a nanny and all the paraphernalia. She really was the most
fabulous baby, and I thought that I was the most wonderful mother --
until I had the second one. Then I realised it was nothing to do with me
at all.''
Child No 2 -- Georgia -- came along in 1986. ''That was a real shock
because for the first year she would not sleep. Jonathan was doing Les
Liaisons Dangereuses in the West End for over a year and I thought I was
Superwoman; I thought I could just nip down to Glyndebourne and do the
season there and have these babies suckling and pulling my hair and
doing all this kind of business.''
The years of hopping out of planes and on to a different stage every
night were finally beginning to take their toll, and Buchanan became
increasingly dissatisfied with her voice. ''Part of the problem is that
you're encouraged to take on other kinds of work. The management of
opera houses and orchestras want you to do more and more and it gets to
the crazy point where it would take a very strong person to say no. I
suddenly realised that it was all making me very tired indeed. The
singing was suffering; I was suffering and so were the children.''
And that was the crux. ''Deep in my heart I was unhappy that I wasn't
being the mum I thought I should be. I had wanted to have children all
my life, and I was letting someone else bring them up while I went away
to rehearse. That just put the tin lid on it, really. I thought: 'OK --
this is a very good time to stop'. It wasn't an easy decision -- in a
way it was quite heart-breaking.''
Buchanan cancelled everything and disappeared from the opera
community, which in turn seemed to drop her. ''It was surprising --
people weren't as supportive as I thought they might be. They didn't
say: 'Come back once you've sorted yourself out'. Most of them just
vanished.'' With hindsight, Buchanan reckons that either colleagues
didn't know what to say to help her through her crisis (and so said
nothing) or else some of them were quietly pleased that her meteoric,
non-apprenticeship-serving rise had ground to a halt, albeit
self-imposed.
Freed from work commitments, Buchanan set about determining what had
gone wrong with her voice. She now believes that she had tried to do too
much and in too many different styles. ''Opera singers like to be seen
to do crossovers -- get into popular music, like Cole Porter and stuff
like that. But to sing those kinds of songs, you cannot apply a
classical technique because the songs just don't sound right. So what do
you do? You loosen up in your technique and you do things that are
perhaps a wee bit harmful to your voice.''
After trying teacher after teacher, Buchanan made contact with John
Hauxwell, a lecturer at the RSAMD in Glasgow. His vocal technique suited
her ''perfectly'', so much so that not only has she regained the
confidence that was eluding her in 1987, but she has also emerged with a
new voice. ''I think that what happened to me was that because Richard
Bonynge discovered that I could sing a similar repertoire to Joan
Sutherland, I was put into roles that weren't really suited to me. I
could never sing the stratospheric notes, but I could sing very high and
I could do a lot of florid music -- full of runs and decorations. My
voice has settled now, and I'm realising that it is more Puccini and
Verdi -- slightly lower soprano.''
Buchanan has not made it officially known that she's ready to hurl
herself on to the opera circuit again. She's currently promoting an
album of Scottish songs which she has recorded with Kenneth MacKellar.
But if the medium she met at a Hogmanay party four years ago is to be
believed, then the opera world should be aware that the date of Isobel
Buchanan's birthday -- in other words, the beginning of the year of her
predicted operatic comeback -- was the Ides of March.

LINUS Roache, who plays Father Greg, is not a Catholic so how did he,
as an actor, prepare for the role? ''I went to Mass a lot, I read a lot
and we had an adviser on the film set,'' he said. ''I think his vocation
was very genuine and real, at the same time, he believes his own
sexuality is wrong. He goes into the priesthood as a way of seeking
purification. The film throws him into this inner city parish, his ideas
are tested, he gets broken down. By the end, however, he is of more
value to the priesthood.
''I imagined he came from a lower middle class background in Sussex.
An only child, he had a tense relationship with his father. His mother
died young and found emotional and spiritual comfort from her priest.
The boy did too. He has this conflict going on all the time between his
sexuality and his vocation -- I don't think he frequented gay clubs on a
regular basis, only when he desperately needed comfort. He is very
repressed and very emotional.
''When it came to the sex scene with Graham, I had to be very clear
about why they needed it to be there. If I found myself doing a
gratuitous love scene, or a gay sex scene, just for exploitative reasons
I would not be in that situation. The scene had to be there. The
audience had to see what he was running away from.
''If the priest breaks the seal of the confessional there is nowhere
for a victim like that girl to go. He has to get her permission to talk.
I met a priest who said that sort of thing happened a hundred times a
year and the film very accurately portrayed the dilemma. He said that,
out of the hundred, many of them took the priest's advice to talk to
someone about it, which this girl refuses to do.
''I was in Dublin on Saturday on a chat show and we asked the audience
what they would do if they found out their local priest was gay, and
only four people wanted him to leave the parish. The church was in the
East End of London. We did the interiors there, and some of the
exteriors in Manchester. The Bishop of Liverpool was not very helpful --
he had some disagreement with certain issues in the script. At Sundance,
a priest got up and said this was the best film ever made about these
issues. At Berlin, some priests said they intended to write to the
Vatican urging it to see the film. None of them saw it as an attack on
the Catholic Church, but as an attack on the hypocrisy that exists.''

IT is clear from Margaret Vaughan's article (March 14) that she has
read none of the literature that has come from the Campaign for
Socialism, the Campaign Group, the MEP's statement, information from my
office on the issue of Clause 4 over the past several months, or indeed
my article published in The Herald on January 11.
Common ownership should be for the common good, as the existing Clause
4 states. It does not advocate Morrisonian state capitalism, as she
quite wrongly states. There has never been any call for nationalising
the sweetie shop.
How does Margaret Vaughan interpret ''the full fruits of their
labour''? It was written into Clause 4 because miners and other
industrial workers wanted their children to have not just fair wages but
also access to education, training, leisure facilities, and whatever
else was necessary for them to reach their full potential as human
beings.
There is a significant groundswell against change to our existing
constitution, or are the 44% who rejected change at the Scottish Labour
Party conference all Stalinists?

THE decision of Labour's Scottish conference to approve a change in
Clause 4 of the party's constitution represents at best a pyrrhic
victory for the party leadership (March 11). A cursory glance at the
events preceding the debate shows how minimal Tony Blair's achievement
was.
The party has been conducting a ''consultation'' exercise to determine
the content of the new statement of aims and values, conveniently
assuming there would be one and ignoring the possibility that people
might prefer to keep the existing statement. Indeed the questionnaire
sent out as part of this process did not even ask whether people thought
the current Clause 4 should be retained.
Then there was the production of videos -- sent to local parties -- in
which John Prescott outlined his case for change. No opposing view was
presented. Similarly, during Tony Blair's much-hyped tour of Britain,
members were told why things must be changed, with contrary viewpoints
being excluded from the platform.
The cost of these shenanigans is running into a six-figure sum of
money -- money which was given to the party in good faith to campaign
against the Tories rather than ensure that one man's views were imposed
on the membership.
At Scottish conference there was a blatant attempt to rig the agenda
and a reception (sponsored by those well-known socialists Tesco) to
allow Mr Blair to make a last-minute effort to charm delegates. On top
of all this, there was the near universal backing of the mass media for
Tony Blair's plans.
Yet despite all these factors the leadership could only obtain 56% of
the vote. Of the party in Scotland 44% ignored the unremitting hostility
of the party establishment and moral blackmail of the ''we must not
embarrass the Leader'' sort and expressed their belief in socialist
principles.
Not a majority certainly, but to obtain such a large vote in such
circumstances clearly shows that support for socialism in the Labour
Party is not as weak as its opponents, outwith and inside the party,
would pretend.

Lesley Stevenson finds that innovative art forms come well above
function in a show of contemporary furniture
THE SHOW of contemporary British furniture at the Crafts Council's
London gallery questions many of the sacred cows of good design. In
fact, several of the pieces are not furniture at all. Ronald Carter's 37
wooden spoons may be made of wood, but there the similarity ends. Any
ideas about functionalism in design have all but disappeared. His spoons
have corkscrew handles, some are folding, some have holes and the most
fork-like have prongs. Clearly these are pieces of furniture for the
post-modern consumer.
Mary Little's selection of upholstered chairs are closer to portraits
than pieces of furniture. Each chair has been given a name and dressed
in suitable fabrics. The spendidly regal Liz incorporates an orb-like
arm and the menacing Genghis resembles a little warrior.
Fred Baier's work has been described as ''form swallows function'',
for any cherished notions about utility have been flouted. This is
furniture closer to sculpture. He explores the use of technology as a
theme in his work and the pieces included have all been designed using a
computer. The rather astonishing Cone+Cube-Cylinder=Table is a virtuoso
piece. Unfortunately someone forgot to remind the computer that tables
need to be flat if one's dinner is not to end up on the carpet.
The table by Peter Chang from Glasgow, produced in acrylic,
fibreglass, and multi-density fibreboard, is about as far from the fine
craft tradition as it is possible to go. Coloured in acid purples,
yellows, and oranges, its asymmetrical design looks like the wing from
some prehistoric animal. Once again the impression is of something
closer to a piece of art than a functional object.
However, the exhibition is not all hand-wringing among the enfants
terribles of British design. Alan Peters, who is especially influenced
by Japanese furniture, is represented by a sublime chest of drawers.
Beautifully simple, functional, and belonging to a recognisable craft
tradition, only the price label is distressing. In total the piece took
400 hours to make -- a reminder that good design and high-quality
craftsmanship cannot come cheaply.
Green issues are not forgotten in the midst of sumptuous materials and
exotic hardwoods. Thomas Eisl's armchair made from lengths of discarded
wood with a seat fashioned from a length of rubber conveyor-belt is both
elegant and ecologically correct.
This carefully selected exhibition demonstrates the wealth of good
design in Britain today. Humour and innovation are balanced by the solid
design principles of some of the more established practitioners. It
manages also to be effortlessly informative about how things are made --
John Coleman's Zupo Chair is shown in varying states of construction and
40 of Rupert Williamson's working models are included, looking for all
the world like furniture from a doll's house.

*Edinburgh-based Dr Anna Ritchie, one of Scotland's most distinguished
archaeologists, describes what she eats and drinks on a typical working
day.
HAD a cup of white coffee when I got up about 7am. At 8am, I went for
a walk up Blackford Hill with our golden retriever. Usually I buy a
crispy roll on the way home to have with coffee, but yesterday I just
ate a banana. I had a meeting of the artefact research unit of the
National Museums at 10 o'clock to discuss progress on an excavation on
Islay.
Had I been meeting a friend for lunch I would have gone to the Queen
Street Cafe. Instead, I bought a filled brown roll with coronation
chicken from Fraser's, the lunchtime takeaway, and took it home. I ate
it with an apple and mineral water. The dog's built-in clock said it was
time for a walk. We went up Craiglockhart Hill and I was back in time to
have a cup of tea (Earl Grey) with my daughter.
The evening meal, at 7pm, started as usual with soup -- an old
favourite, with leeks, potatoes, carrots, and celery. Our next course
was pasta with grated courgettes, lightly cooked in olive oil mixed with
Greek yoghurt. We finished with fruit and cheese.
This one was Welsh, Teifi, named after a Welsh river where I once saw
people fishing from coracles the way our ancestors did thousands of
years ago. I had mineral water to drink.
The meal had to be fairly swift, as I do a long-distance class with
Aberdeen. By 9.30, after two hours close to the telephone, I had a hot
ear and a thirst. My husband brought me a tall glass of whisky with
ginger and ice. That's it. I went to bed at 11pm.

FRIDAY morning, and a nice Englishman resident in Cologne has phoned
the Feedback programme to complain about the ''little England'' view
which he thinks Radio 4 is increasingly inclined to project. He accuses
the news programmes, in particular, of having lost all sense of
proportion, of spending five times as long on the sexuality of the
Bishop of London as on the World Poverty Summit and the recent alarming
civil disturbances in Istanbul combined; and of conniving, during the
recent furore over animal transportation, in ill-informed chauvinistic
myths about the superiority of British practice in these matters, when,
in fact, Germany already regulates the transport of live animals more
tightly than we do. He says he is embarrassed, now, that he fought so
hard, just a few years ago, to keep Radio 4 on long wave, where north
European listeners can hear it; and he adds the killer observation that
he has been forced to recognise that German Radio actually provides a
better and more balanced news service, with more serious priorities, and
a stronger interest in world affairs.
Well; in all the long catalogue of British decline from world power to
increasing irrelevance, I don't think there can be an allegation more
depressing than this. To lose empire, power, money, influence, and the
reputation of the City of London is one thing, and potentially good for
the soul; to lose the ability to see things straight and to talk sense
about them, is another matter, and much more serious, especially since
most British people still tend to assume that what they see or hear on
the BBC news represents a fairly trustworthy representation of what is
going on in the world.
Yet I think that the gentleman in Cologne has a point; every time I go
outside Britain now, I feel increasingly embarrassed by the image of the
place that emerges from the little radio on my bedside table. Last week,
in the Czech Republic, it was the World Service rather than Radio 4 that
was the culprit, but the problem seemed the same; it was as if British
culture, as represented by the BBC in London, has begun to turn into a
genteel 1940s parody of itself, all Bertie-Woosterish readings, church
services, Dave Lee Travis making cumbersome, middle-aged attempts at
''zany'' humour for the pop music audience, and effete old chaps droning
on at length about Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary, as if
this backwater of English music -- recently well and rightly explored in
Radio 3's Fairest Isle season -- should be of compelling international
interest. Even the news bulletins, wrapped in this alarming acreage of
the smug, the insular, the ignorant and the patronising, seemed to have
lost their old authority and depth, as if they had contracted a virus of
superficiality from their new cut-price American-style stablemate, World
Service Newshour.
The only relief came in the contributions of two veterans who seemed
to have retained an old fashioned sense of responsibility for, and
knowledge of, the world at large, Alistair Cooke in his Letter from
America (how is it that these weekly essays just grow better and better,
so many decades on?) and -- startlingly -- Her Majesty the Queen, whose
annual message to the Commonwealth bore the stamp of a weary but
increasingly wise woman who has learned from much experience that in the
last years of the 20th century British insularity is not enough;
although, unfortunately, the effect of her sensible remarks was spoiled
by the stentorian playing of the National Anthem at the end of them. My
east European room-mate, interested, like me, in hearing a sensible and
authoritative programme of international news, rolled her eyes and
shrugged; a gesture which already seems to me all too typical of
attitudes to Britain across Europe, as the huge, decaying cultural hulk
of the nation's imperial past settles ever lower in the water, and -- so
far as international reputation is concerned -- drags every other aspect
of life in this island down with it. Which is why the BBC must truly
learn to decentralise to Britain's nations and regions, or die; but that
as they say, is another story.

WHEN is the carping going to stop? Isn't it about time everyone in
Glasgow got wholeheartedly behind the GDA's plan for a science centre at
Pacific Quay and started working for its completion? Judging by your
correspondence columns we seem more intent on building the Tower of
Babel than anything else.
It is clear from Gavin Bell's even-handed article that the decision to
build a science centre has already been made and is much more
economically feasible. Proponents of the other scheme should accept
defeat gracefully. When the winning entry for the science centre is
selected, let's get on with it without any more sniping and backbiting.
If we don't, we are in danger of emulating the fiasco over the Welsh
Opera House or Edinburgh's famous hole in the ground.
A top-grade science centre, linked to our universities and colleges,
sounds a pretty reasonable route to take on what is, after all, a
brownfield site. Coupled with the business park element, it's more
likely to act as a catalyst for jobs than any project aimed largely at
the leisure market.
There will always be an opening for expanding the leisure market, but
if we miss the chance of a science centre it may be gone forever.

CLIVE TURNER, who represents the tobacco industry, celebrates No
Smoking Day by claiming that smoking is decreasing dramatically among
young women (March 8). I wish this were the case, but it isn't -- at
least not yet.
The figures he quotes from the Office of Population and Censuses
demonstrate that there has been very little decline in smoking
prevalence among 16 to 19-year-old women between 1982 and 1992.
The ''dramatic'' decline claimed by Mr Turner relates only to the
years 1990-1992. This has yet to be demonstrated to be any kind of
trend. We will have to wait until the figures for 1994 become available
before celebrating.
Mr Turner also boasts that there has been no increase in smoking rates
among the under-16s. Surely the point is that between 1982 and 1992
there has been no decrease in smoking rates among school children, to
whom it is illegal to sell tobacco.

AN ELDERLY woman has died of the so-called flesh eating disease,
necrotising fasciitis, in the third case at Falkirk Royal Infirmary
within six months, it emerged last night.
However, the hospital insists that nothing more than ''misfortune'' or
''co-incidence'' lies behind the cluster of cases.
Mrs Gladys McDonald, 69, of Stenhousemuir, Stirlingshire, died on
Tuesday after being admitted the previous week for a minor operation.
She appeared to be recovering well but then developed the necrotising
fasciitis infection.
She underwent immediate surgery and seemed to be making good progress
but her condition suddenly deteriorated.
Mrs Elizabeth Sutherland, sister of the former Beirut hostage Mr Tom
Sutherland, died in January after being admitted to the infirmary
complaining of a sore throat.
Bonnybridge mother Mrs Linda Smith developed the disease after giving
birth in the hospital's maternity unit in October.
Surgeons removed the infected flesh and Mrs Smith survived after lying
unconscious for 41 days.
A statement released by the hospital last night said: ''Doctors and
surgeons are completely satisfied that there is no connection between
the cases of necrotising fasciitis.''
The hospital's medical director, Mr Douglas Harper, added: ''The
investigations that have so far been concluded demonstrate conclusively
that there was no link whatsoever between the bacterial strain involved
in the first and second cases and similarly no link between the strain
involved in the second and third cases.''
It is understood the strain in the third case is of the same group as
the bacterium involved in the first, though the results of further tests
are awaited to allow a full identification to take place.
The hospital's consultant micro-biologist, Dr Jim McGavigan, said
yesterday the hospital had instituted an immediate screening programme
of all employees with access to the surgical units, checking for the
bacterium which caused the disease.
Around 10% of the population carry the streptococcal bacterium,
normally associated with the condition, harboured in the throat and
nose.
Dr McGavigan said no sign of the bacterium had been detected in those
staff tested so far and indicated only a small number had not yet been
screened because of holiday commitments.
The hospital statement said: ''The elderly patient was admitted for a
minor operation last week. Subsequent to the operation, the wound became
infected and a further operation was necessary to remove the infected
tissue. She died four days later.''
The statement added: ''As far as any possible external factors are
concerned, these are outwith the hospital's area of investigation.''
Last night, the dead woman's husband, Mr Jamie McDonald, 77, and
daughter, Mrs Anne Scott, called for an independent investigation. In a
statement, they said they had met representatives of Falkirk Royal
management.
They added: ''We urged them to undertake an independent inquiry for
the benefit of ourselves, the hospital, and the community.''
The family pointed to the fact that the homes of four victims of the
flesh-eating disease are within a few miles of each other.
Almost a year ago, Mrs Roseanne Miller, 44, of Bonnybridge, was found
to have the disease at Stirling's King's Park Hospital and recovered
after surgery.

A CAMPAIGN to combat the ''appalling'' number of street deaths caused
by Scotland's escalating homeless problem was launched yesterday.
Victims' mothers and friends spoke of their disgust at society's
failure to tackle the desperate situations confronted by many homeless
people.
The background was a haunt for people who sleep rough, the Anderston
Centre in Glasgow, evoking strong images of their plight.
The campaign was launched by the Big Issue, the magazine sold by the
homeless. Six of its vendors have died on Scottish streets since
Christmas.
Mrs Thelma Brown, 49, of Croftfoot, Glasgow, whose son Stuart died in
November, said many of the deaths were drugs-related. She warned that
young people would tonight again take to drugs and the streets.
Vendors told of friends being put in intensive care because of attacks
while sleeping rough, and of problems in getting treatment for illnesses
at doctors' surgeries because they had no addresses.
As a gesture of support, people are being asked to wear black
armbands, issued by the magazine, as a mark of respect to the dead
during the two-week campaign.

MORE than 300 people in the Fife village of Freuchie, which was
affected by polluted water, have been innoculated against possible
infection from the virus hepatitis A.
A spokesman for Fife Health Board confirmed yesterday that the
vaccination programme was proceeding well.
The board said it hoped that everyone invited to take part in the
emergency programme as a precautionary measure would be immunised by
today.
About 600 people, including adults and children -- half the population
of the village -- were affected by polluted water from a vegetable
produce plant, which found its way into the mains system.
The company, Kettle Produce, has already apologised for being
''unwittingly to blame'' for the water pollution.
Environmental health officials are still working with the company in
an attempt to clarify how the incident happened.

DESPITE the enormous interest in home interiors that has been growing
steadily over the past few years, lighting remains something of a
Cinderella area. Which is a pity, since poor lighting can mean the
difference between a room scheme working or not.
Neil Scott was an electrician until around 18 months ago when,
enthused by the growing variety of domestic lighting on the market, he
made a decision to abandon his trade and re-route himself into
retailing.
''There's always something new coming on to the market. I was
conscious of enjoying the variety that's available -- in Europe they're
much more lighting-aware than we are. They produce some good designs,''
Scott explains.
When he opened his shop he was reasonably confident there was a
typical Scottish taste in design terms. However, he's since changed his
mind: ''I've found people are quite broad in their ideas,'' he smiles.
''What often happens here is that people redecorate a room but leave the
light that's been up for 20 years. ''The first thing to look at is the
height of the ceiling and the size of the room,'' he advises. ''A nice
high ceiling is good news, it can take an attractive pendant-style
fitting -- perhaps with matching wall lights, and nowadays you can get
these co-ordinating with table lamps too.
''New houses, because the ceilings are so low, are increasingly wired
for wall lights, which is nicer. If you are buying a new house, one of
the best things to do is to get centralised electric points controlled
from the switch at the door, so that you can light all the lamps with
one movement. A dimmer switch is ideal, the whole mood and ambience of
the room can be changed by turning down the lights.''
Scott has recently brought in some zany, eccentric French table lamps
with highly individual, elongated ceramic shapes topped with shades in
hessian, parchment, or plastic in bright colours. French designer Pierre
Casenove has created a whole range of ceramic accessories around his
lamps, pots with lids, candlesticks, bowls. Inclusive of shades, the
lamps cost between #85 and #110.
At Moon River Lighting, Scott's shop in Stirling, he has Spanish
uplighters with matching centre lights and table lamps in quite
delicate-looking designs which resemble pewter, with a gold and ''rust''
effect.
''One of the companies I spoke to recently has brought out some new
wrought-iron lighting,'' says Scott. ''Instead of coating to create a
rust effect, they dip the metal for six weeks in an ageing process and
it comes out with a nice, even rust finish.'' The treatment he assures
us is then arrested so there's no fear of the lighting being reduced to
a pile of dust.
At In House in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Italian designer Marcello
Ziliani's latest wall light designs have been creating a stir. Sally and
Piperita are both made of glass, available in shades of white, pink,
amber, or mint green, with brackets of bronze or silver.
The Sally has a simple bell-shaped shade, while Piperita's is a gently
curved plain rectangle. Charlie, on the other hand, shares only the same
shade shape and choice of bracket colour while introducing an entirely
different look with a ribbed metal shade available in dark grey or gold.

<TEXT>
TORY chairman Mr Jeremy Hanley plunged himself back into political
trouble yesterday by stepping up his allegations about corruption in
Labour councils despite a noted lack of support from senior colleagues.
Appearing increasingly out on a limb, Mr Hanley insisted his position
as party chairman meant he could speak ''as I think fit'' where other
Cabinet Ministers had to choose their words more carefully.
''There are very many examples of corruption in Labour councils, but
particularly poor services and political posturing. They serve the
unions. They don't serve the people they were elected to serve,'' he
said.
But there was anger in a number of the ''rotten boroughs'' marked down
by Conservative Central Office as seats of corruption.
Authorities like Derbyshire, Tameside, and Haringey claimed the Tories
had dug up old or isolated examples of corruption which did not
represent the reality.
Mr Hanley admitted it was ''clearly true'' that not all Labour
councillors had their hands in the till but claimed they were at the
centre of many more corruption allegations than the Tories.
Challenged about the marked lack of support from senior Tories for the
accusations, Mr Hanley said: ''There are certain positions, such as
Environemnt Secretary and Prime Minister, who have to choose their words
with care. I am chairman of the party and what I am doing is I am
choosing words as I think fit for the occasion.''
Deputy Tory chairman Mr John Maples on Thursday effectively apologised
for the earlier claim by Mr Hanley that Labour councils ''tend to be
corrupt''.
Environment Secretary John Gummer conspicuously failed to mention
corruption yesterday as he stuck to the traditional list of ''sins'' of
Labour councils.
''Labour's record in local government is the story of socialism in
practice -- high taxes, profligate spending, incompetence, waste, and
poor services,'' he said at a local election campaign launch in Norwich.
Meanwhile, former party chairman Lord Parkinson said the Government
was ''facing a very difficult situation''.
In the wake of former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine's suggestion that a
period in opposition would do the Tories good, Lord Parkinson said: ''It
(the Government) is lagging in the polls, struggling, and yet the
economy is doing extremely well.''
Labour accused Mr Hanley of bringing politics into disrepute. Shadow
Education Secretary David Blunkett said: ''Jeremy Hanley's immature and
abusive language over the last two days has only served to worsen the
Government's image as the party of sleaze and gutter politics.
''His ineptitude has been reinforced by the fact that in the week he
chose to launch this assault, two Conservative councillors for Lambeth
were facing court charges.
''Most of the slurs on local councils have been totally refuted and
others have turned out to be years old.''

<HEADLINE>Trial told of years of 'bridge bashing' before fatal crash</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ROADS official yesterday told a trial of the years of ''bridge
bashing'' before a bus crash in which three Girl Guides and two of their
leaders were killed.
Mr Edward Eden, 50, admitted no extra signs warning of a low overhead
rail bridge were erected until after the accident. Mr Eden, Strathclyde
region's network manager for roads in Glasgow's south side, said:
''Because of financial restraints, we had to be careful how we spent
money.''
He said that, although there had been 37 cases of high vehicles
hitting the bridge in West Street on Glasgow's south side, there had
been no injuries for three years before the fatal accident.
Mr Campbell Devlin, 30, of Rannoch Street, Cathcart, denies at Glasgow
Sheriff Court driving a double-deck bus dangerously in West Street in
September last year, causing the deaths of five people.
Mr Eden said his department had an annual budget of #15m and had to
spend it in areas where people were being injured.
The new warning signs at West Street cost #5000, he said. He told the
court that if money had been available it could have been used in areas
like West Street as well as in places where injuries were happening.
The court has heard how the Guides' singing, as they returned from a
Sunday trip to Wonderwest World at Ayr, turned to screams as the
Clydeside 2000 bus hit the bridge.
Mr Eden told Miss Elizabeth Munro, prosecuting, that because of the
large number of accidents involving high vehicles at the West Street
bridge it was known in his department as ''bridge bashing''.
Mr Eden said that until the fatal accident there were two signs
warning that the bridge clearance height was 10ft 6in. Despite this,
drivers either did not see the signs or ignored them.
After the fatal accident, extra warning signs had been erected up to
500 yards from the bridge and since then there had been six other
incidents involving high vehicles at the bridge, the last on Monday this
week. He said that 8000 vehicles a day used West Street.
Questioned by Mr David Burns, QC, defending, Mr Eden said he thought
the warning signs both before the accident and since were adequate and
legal.
Mr Burns said: ''Members of your own department showed concern about
this bridge before the accident. Do you accept any portion of
responsibility for what happened?''
Mr Eden replied: ''There was no reason, before the accident, why the
signs were not adequate.''
It is alleged Mr Devlin caused the deaths of Guide leaders Mrs Robina
Dougall, 47, of Boon Drive, Mrs Mary McGreskin, 39, of Drummore Road,
and Guides Catherine McKnight, 10, of Pitmilly Road, Margaret Riddick,
11, of Bankglen Road, and Laura Cullen, 10, of Belsyde Avenue, all
Drumchapel, Glasgow.
The charge states that 15 other Guides aged between 10 and 15 were
injured, six of them seriously. The trial continues.

FIVE years ago the Scots were very critical of the English hype as to
the chances of England beating Scotland at Murrayfield. Particular scorn
was poured on the advance production of England Grand Slam 1990 sweaters
by enterprising and confident people.
I was much amused therefore to learn that a mill in Walkerburn is
producing Scottish Grand Slam sweaters.
Entrepreneurial they may be, but the fact that they are not
embroidering a date on to the sweaters does suggest a certain lack of
confidence.
Don't let Gavin and the boys hear!

GAVIN BELL's very good article on the future of Pacific Quay in
Glasgow injected some much needed common sense into this long-running
debate.
Just about the last thing this city needs is a visitor attraction
whose principal element remains closed for more than half a year. I
suspect we all have rose-tinted memories of the garden festival because
it was staged in glorious weather and was the first major event
heralding Glasgow's regeneration.
Let's not forget our normal two seasons are winter and July.
A science centre is much more in keeping with our reputation abroad.
Although heavy industry has vanished, we're still largely regarded as a
city with high engineering and technical skills.
Such a centre would be an excellent educational tool and might inspire
more young folk to pursue careers in that direction. We really don't
need another round of low-paid, hamburger-serving jobs being claimed as
a major victory for employment.
Glasgow needs to create skilled, well-salaried, hi-tech employment. A
top-class science centre and business park is more in keeping with our
needs.

AS the last secretary of the Communist Party in Scotland before its
1991 transformation into Democratic Left Scotland, I was disappointed by
Ian Bell's book review on the party which, written by a good journalist,
didn't fail to let a good story get in the way of the facts.
The reality was that the British Communist Party, like all similar
organisations, came from a dual tradition -- one of following a lead
from where it believed socialism had been established but also of
developing a British and Scottish Marxist tradition according to the
conditions prevailing here. This worked both ways.
Hence the influence which members had on the Scottish Labour movement.
Hence the involvement of the Scottish Labour movement in
extra-parliamentary activity, and indeed its deep involvement, for
instance, in Scotland's democratic struggle for a parliament.
Conversely, however, it was its deep involvement in the Scottish
working class and working class elsewhere, plus the experience of new
and important social movements, which helped impel the need for change
within the Communist Party, both in its own practice and also in its own
strategies.
Without the support of the Scottish members of the Communist Party,
and their experience, it is indeed inconceivable that the changes could
have taken place and the transformation into Democratic Left achieved.
It's a pity that this does not come over in the review.
Rather than ''hope betrayed'' it was a case of hope transformed,
bringing the best of a valuable tradition into line with the type of
politics adequate to change our society today, 75 years on from the
founding of the CP.

TOM SHIELDS (March 9) notes that ''unlike some newspapers we don't
have to change our name as a token gesture for International Women's

But The Herald is not politically correct. ''The Hisald'' would also
be biased. Nothing less than ''The Theirsald'' would be acceptable.

WENDY JACK finds
imperial inspiration in
the latest line in
furnishing fabrics
VARIETY is the spice of life. When it comes to choosing furnishing
fabrics so vast is the choice, how on earth do you make up your mind?
Epitomising the spectrum of designs on offer this spring are two very
different looks shown here: the Raj Collection from the John Lewis Group
and Check Book from Sanderson.
No need, of course, to ask where the inspiration for Raj came from.
The collection comprises four classic Indian patterns, in four colour
groups, designed specially to complement each other. Mix them, match
them, you can't go wrong.
The main pattern that inspired the collection is called Rasamanjari, a
subtle and beautiful design based on an antique fabric combining some of
the best of Indian and English influences.
Indian motifs harmonise happily as the backdrop to a very English urn
filled with fruits and flowers while the co-ordinating fabrics are
Kalapuri, which is the background pattern of Rasamanjari, Myapore, a
paisley pattern, and Kumar Stripe, an elegant paisley stripe.
Each design is available in biscuit, rose, jade, or corn, is machine
washable and costs #14 per metre.
Rasamanjari and Myapore are printed on a new linen and cotton cloth
with nylon, particularly suitable for upholstery when used in
conjunction with a flame-retardant interliner. Kalapuri and Kumar Stripe
are both 100% cotton fabrics.
Quite different in style and mood are checks, hugely popular at the
moment in every mode from tiny ginghams to mighty plaids.
They are fresh and of-the-moment yet one of the most enduring
patterns, regularly updated by successive generations and obligingly
working well over and over again.
Sanderson greets spring this year with a glorious palette of 31
different colourways in its new Check Book collection of woven fabrics
in 100% cotton, suitable for drapes -- and upholstery when used with a
flame-retardant interliner.
There are three designs to choose from in the Check Book: Table Cloth
Check -- a large, striking plaid; Tea Cloth Check -- a window-pane
design; and Apron Check -- a smaller graph-paper check.
Each complements the others -- build one check on top of another, mix
the colours, contrast or match them.
And colours? Select neutrals: cream, oatmeal through to chocolate.
Exotic in aubergine, spicy red, hot pink . . . or consider indigo blues,
rich ruby reds, mustard yellow, emerald, cooling down with cornflower
blue, lemon yellow, and pea green.
Each Check Book design costs #14.95 a metre.

A SCHOOLBOY was killed yesterday and seven others were injured, one
seriously, when a tree crashed down on them as they sheltered from a
storm.
The boys, all boarders aged between 14 and 15 from the private Seaford
College, East Lavington, West Sussex, were training with the Army Cadet
Corps.
Police said the boys had been sheltering behind a shed in the college
grounds when a gust brought the tree crashing down.
A spokesman said: ''One of the boys was found to be dead at the scene.
The most badly hurt was airlifted to St Richard's Hospital, Chichester,
by police helicopter.''
Meanwhile, seven vehicles were involved in a pile-up on the M74 at
Abington in Lanarkshire last night.
Five people were taken to hospital but the most serious injury was a
fractured leg suffered by a man. It is understood that the accident
happened after one vehicle broke down.
And a child suffered minor injuries last night when he was struck by a
police car in Machrie Road, Castlemilk, Glasgow. A spokesman for
Strathclyde Police said the boy had run from a footpath and collided
with the driver's side of the vehicle, striking his head off the
windscreen. He was released after treatment at the Victoria Infirmary.

I SUPPOSE one does acquire a certain expertise in theological subjects
after a lifetime in the business but Mr John Young's admiration of my
knowledge (March 11) should be tempered by the fact that such knowledge
is not arrived at without a hard slog during student days. Such days
were not effortless.
While I have sought to take the scriptural view, Mr Young's authority
is Burns. No wonder the church is in such a pathetic state. I am not
surprised Mr Young is ''liberal''.
It is difficult to understand how folk who retain a wonder and a great
deal of goodwill for the Kirk and its master and who worship
occasionally as part of their spiritual life and pilgrimage only do so
when it suits them. Does such wonder not evoke regular worship? If not,
it is a strange pilgrimage indeed.
Has it ever occurred to John Young that those who hold the
conservative evangelical viewpoint like myself are even more weary than
he of modernistic and liberal preachers poisoning the hearts and minds
of their people by preaching ''another Gospel''? There is no such thing
as a Christian who is not ''born again''.
Mr Young's letter is headed ''Passing judgment''. Thank God the
Puritans, the Reformers, and the Covenanters passed judgment which
enabled the church in Scotland and elsewhere to take the right course
and not be led into pathways of darkness and error.

After escaping a violent relationship, one woman was easily traced,
harassed and eventually murdered by her husband. The tragedy provoked an
angry response and demands for change in a system which refuses to
recognise the true nature of the problem. But, even as intransigent
policy makers continue to put women at risk, Jennifer Cunningham
discovers that Scotland is leading the way with effective yet simple
measures to prevent further violence and save lives
Crime has doubled in the last 25 years, yet only one person in 50 is
actually caught . . . Domestic violence is one in four of all violent
crimes but for so long has been sidelined and not treated as a question
of crime
Nine women who have left violent men, but live with the fear that they
will turn up on the doorstep and threaten them, have panic buttons of
the sort used by elderly people. Only two of the women have not had to
press the button
LIKE all the best ideas, it is a simple one. It was a 19-year-old who
said: ''Why can't you give women who are in danger from men an alarm
like my granny's?''
Now nine women in Central Region who have left violent men, but live
with the fear that they will turn up on the doorstep, threaten them or
demand entry to the house, have panic buttons of the sort used by
thousands of elderly people.
The scheme is three months old and only two of the women have not had
to press the button. As soon as they do the phone rings in the region's
emergency care control and case details appear on the computer screen
with a message to call the police immediately.
So far it has taken an average of three minutes for the police to be
at the door -- complete with vital details such as whether an interdict
is in force against the man and what age the children are.
''Utterly brilliant. You need to publicise this so that authorities
all over the country can use it. Call it the Stirling System,'' urged
Clare Short, Labour's spokesperson on women's issues.
Women's Aid workers in Central Region are still angry and distressed
that a woman who had lived in one of their refuges to escape from her
violent husband was murdered after he had discovered the address of her
new house from the Reporter to the Children's Panel.
They say subsequent promises from the Scottish Office that the rules
will be tightened to prevent such a thing ever happening again do not
begin to deal with the real problem highlighted by this incident: the
lack of understanding of domestic violence by the people who run the
country's institutions.
After 20 years of bringing the plight of battered women to public
consciousness, what is causing real despair among Women's Aid workers is
the failure to recognise the seriousness of individual incidents -- and
to build in ways of preventing them.
In this case the man had already obtained the address of the refuge
where the woman was staying from the Children's Panel Reporter and tried
to approach his wife there. ''When we protested, they apologised for
that, so they were perfectly well aware of the violent nature of this
man. Yet they gave out her new address,'' said Jackie MacPherson.
Listening carefully, Short promised to investigate whether a Private
Member's Bill extending the scope of interdicts could have any
application in Scotland.
In Stirling to boost Labour's local government election campaign, the
MP for Birmingham Ladywood made safety for women her platform. A
10-point charter on women's safety includes a number of pledges for
future Labour councils including adequate provision of alternative
accommodation for victims of domestic violence.
''The Tories are extremely backward and try to label any movement to
promote the position of women, loony left and say it is crazy and should
be closed down. When you come to the question of crime, you see how our
agenda is absolute commonsense.
''We live at a time when crime has doubled since 1979, when half of
all pensioners in the UK are scared to go out of their houses at night
-- that's the level of fear of crime with which people are living -- and
we have endlessly irrelevant Criminal Justice Bills, one after another
from Michael Howard as crime gets worse. Only one person in 50 who
commits a crime is ever caught. So increasing penalties when you cannot
catch the criminals in the first place does not make life safer for
people.
''We need much more comonsense, down-to-earth partnerships between
local government and the police to keep people safer in a whole variety
of ways. Domestic violence is one in four of all violent crimes but for
so long has been sidelined and not treated as a question of crime.
''Scotland's lead on the Zero Tolerance campaign, having been launched
in Edinburgh and taken up strongly here, is now spreading throughout the
whole country. Scotland has given the lead in creating a new climate of
opinion and in mobilising the resources needed. It is intolerable that
as we approach the end of the century, so many women are still in fear
of violence from their husbands and neglected by the police and the
providers of housing.
''We need to look at how we provide for the victims of crime and also
at prevention and all the things like street lighting that are so
important when people are frightened of being attacked when they are
walking down dark alleys. It has been shown time and again that things
like better public transport, night-time transport for women and
better-designed public spaces all reduce the levels of crime.''
That husky, strident tone everyone associates with Short was there
only at her morning press conference, aggressively so when a male
reporter tried to steer her on to his agenda. For the rest of the day,
her long community pedigree (director of a Birmingham inner-city group,
Youthaid and the Unemployment Unit) was showing as she listened to and
empathised with Women's Aid, women councillors and women candidates.
Clearly feeling among friends, there was no banging of the feminist
drum, not even heated debate, and the only trace of the VIP flown in for
the occasion came in a series of pertinent questions about local
conditions delivered with perfect timing in the flow of a conversation
which encompassed women's battles in local government, childcare
provision in the rest of Europe and the fickle behaviour of the banks
towards their women employees, offering family-friendly conditions of
work when it suited them, squeezing them in the recession.
One of those women who look unfortunately thrown together in
photographs, she is in reality superbly organised and the practised
politician. The knitted coral two-piece could be described as
understated elegance, but she dresses it down with a chunky knitted
jacket that would take her comfortably to the dampest of council houses.
The hair which could take on Shirley Williams for messiness after a
head-tossing debate, is actually perfectly cut.
Stirling District is currently Conservative-controlled, decided on a
cut of the cards, while Central Region is Labour. There is no SNP
councillor in either authority, where politics remain more polarised
than most Scottish councils.
Short here was in her element congratulating retiring councillor,
Helen Livingstone, on her long service, commiserating with Margaret
Brisling, one-time chairperson of the women's committee in Stirling
until it was axed by the Conservative administration, and suggesting to
general acclaim that there should be a woman candidate for the marginal
Stirling seat (brought more clearly into Labour's sights by boundary
changes) at the next General Election.

VIVIAN Stanshall's rich and gargling upper-crust tones led to his
grievous mis-casting as the epitome of English eccentricity: whimsical
and quaint, but above all harmless. Additionally, his dandy's passion
for brocaded smoking-jackets, fezzes, and insouciant twenties music-hall
jollity masked his true worth as a savage satirist and quicksilver
comedic genius.
He spent his entire life -- he died in a fire at his home earlier this
month, days short of his 52nd birthday -- engaging in vitriolic attacks
on hypocrisy; cant; humbug; complacency; deceit; self-delusion;
pretension; the innate preposterousness of the human condition . . . not
to mention po-faced commentators given to coining such precious phrases
as the innate preposterousness of the human condition.
As the suavely-arresting frontman of the Bonzo Dog Band in the
sixties, Vivian was swiftly assumed into that swinging era's
socio-cultural epicentre, appearing in the Beatles' Magical Mystery
Tour; having a single produced by Paul McCartney; forming lasting
friendships with other musical icons of the age, Pete Townshend, Eric
Clapton, Jack Bruce, Keith Moon, Stevie Winwood.
But he could not blind himself to the artistic follies of the sixties,
and, bravely going against the prevailing tide of critical opinion, he
ridiculed them as they were happening.
Can blue men sing the whites? Vivian scoffed during an infamous period
of British misappropriation of the blues. His targets were manifold.
Pedlars of cod-psychedelic mumbo-jumbo; the patent insincerity of
showbiz; the too-common insistence in sundry art-forms that ''American''
automatically means ''more authentic''. Inane pre-packaged dance crazes;
sentimentality; celluloid myth-making; the macho excesses common to
hard-boiled crime fiction; consumerism as utopia's handmaiden.
Above all, Vivian Stanshall was always acutely conscious of the
insidious evils of the British class-system -- perhaps as a result of
his having been saddled, via childhood elocution lessons, with the
accent of an archetypal toff. Having been brought up as a proletarian
misfit in cheap'n'cheerful Southend, he thereafter relentlessly attacked
upper-class idiocy; middle-class acquisitiveness; working-class
passivity, the crippling tediousness of adhering to fixed social
routine.
Yet while he was very hard on those around him, he was cruellest on
himself. Much of the latter half of Vivian Stanshall's life, disfigured
by his alcohol and tranquilliser dependency, was a pitiable
minute-to-minute battle to retain his dignity as a human being.
I met him at his London home on three occasions. Twice he was well;
once he was not. There was no happy middle way. During our first
meeting, in 1987, he revealed that his dependency on tranquillisers,
prescribed in the wake of a nervous breakdown brought on by the
dissolution of the Bonzos in 1970, had left him living in a gut-churning
state of constant anxiety.
He had been in and out of mental hospitals. He had endured crippling
agoraphobia, spending 18 months in his room, kept alive by daily
taxi-borne deliveries of vitamin pills, two-litre bottles of gin, and
his prescription-drugs. Through it all, the act of writing had been the
one way in which Vivian had demonstrated his will to live.
When I met Vivian again, in 1990, he was plainly unwell, clad in a
frankly alarming and all-too-revealing crimson djellabah, and prone to
flights of distraction and mental disturbance. Eighteen months later,
however, after a successful solo tour -- his first for 21 years -- he
was answering phone-callers with upbeat cries of sufficient robustness
to set a-quiver the strings of the many instruments in his flat.
''Darling, I'm back, smothered in sequins, like a young Heracles!''
Vivian boomed fruitily at one point into the phone-receiver.
That phrase -- revelling with startling singularity in all the
possibilities of the English language -- gives some clue to his genius
as a wordsmith. He loved words; he loved constructing sentences of
baroque orotundity and complex, moistly-fecund exactitude.
Vivian wrote with a vaulting, multi-layered originality and
strangeness; with jewelled precision and unique freshness. His humour
was illuminated by his undying ability to make shocking connections. His
laughter-making was possessed by an inexplicable and liberating
barminess. His writing made demands of his audience. In return, it
offered dazzlement.
Nowhere was this plainer than in Vivian's play, Stinkfoot. It was
staged at London's Bloomsbury Theatre in 1988 by Andy Arnold, now
artistic director of Glasgow's Arches Theatre, for whom Vivian also
wrote two musical pieces -- on St Mungo, and Shackleton's Antarctic
expedition -- in 1990.
''Viv was a genius, and as a genius, because he had to go his own way,
because he wouldn't tolerate the slipshod or shoddy, he caused grief to
everyone who ever worked with him,'' Andy recalls. ''He was a consummate
artist, the only one I've ever met. He could hold his own across the
whole artistic spectrum.
''He was a rich, bold, strong painter; a musician; a writer; a natural
actor. Like Tony Hancock, he was the archetypal tragic comic figure. A
sad-faced pessimist consumed by issues of misery, fate and death,
depression and self-doubt.
''Co-directing Stinkfoot with Viv was a nightmare. Viv's
interpretation was very complicated, with a massively-detailed subtext
for every character, lots of metaphors and parallels which were
perfectly obvious to Viv, but he hadn't explained them to anyone else.
''His music was brilliant, wonderful songs . . . but they were all in
his head. He'd turn up with his ukelele, a roll-up hanging from the
corner of his mouth, then pluck away on the uke for a bit, and say:
'That's it', leaving the band to work out his non-existent arrangements
for strings and brass.
''To say the least, the costumes he wanted were difficult . . . we had
to have a half-cooked shrimp which appeared on stage for less than a
minute. Viv designed the Stinkfoot set, this brilliant blue creation,
all rolling sea and cascading waves, but it was so steeply-raked that
the actors couldn't stand up on it. On the opening night, we had to
hammer rubber soles on to the actors' shoes so they wouldn't fall. We
once lost one of the singers, actually . . . she toppled into the
orchestra pit.
''There were impossible stage directions requesting thunder and
lightning, and saying things like 'With heroic gestures the company sing
their discombobulation' or there'd be gnomic observations on the
mechanics of the scenery: 'The clouds require three operators'.''
Despite all this, Andy has never been able to think of Vivian
Stanshall with anything less than warm hilarity. ''In rehearsals he'd
suddenly stand up and, a propos of nothing, shout comic nonsense --
'Officers must not wear lipstick whilst dancing together!' -- and the
room would dissolve.''
What was Stinkfoot about? Did it embody Vivian's philosophy?
''It wasn't what Viv insisted we call it . . . 'An English comic opera
in the grand tradition of Gilbert and Sullivan'. What it was was a
heavily-autobiographical burlesque musical comedy about a clapped-out
music-hall entertainer, the Great Soliquisto, in a run-down
end-of-the-pier show. The question the show posed was 'What is the
secret of art?' ''
And what was the show's answer to this question?
''That there is no secret to art. Viv was very contemptuous of people
who are looking for secrets. Art is simply something you do . . . if you
have the talent.''
In one of my conversations with him, Vivian had articulated a
similarly democratic view of art: ''At its best, the theatre should
inspire people to say: 'Gorblimey, I could do that!' . . . it should
persuade them to try.''
I feel certain that Vivian Stanshall is currently fossicking
resonantly above the fluffiest clouds in art's Valhalla, trying to teach
new truths to his heroes, his peers. He'll be giving Raymond Chandler
lessons in vocabulary, and teaching Elvis Presley that, contrary to the
arcane title of one of Elvis's lesser-known hits, there is room to
rhumba in a sports car.
Oh, and Vivian will also be emitting a scornful ''Pshaw!'' at
soft-headed folk like me with their teary and sentimental notions about
Viv Stanshall being in heaven.
I know he is, though. He has to be, having spent so much of his time
on earth in hell.

THE war heroine Odette who died this week was a symbol of what is
wonderful about France. Her courage and determination were implacable in
the face of torture. Her modesty typified in the quiet burial before her
death was made public.
Jacques Chirac is another person I find it easy to admire. He has
suave charm and, it seems, a balanced and non-partisan attitude to the
new Europe. He wants it to be ''a Europe of the people'', not driven by
bureaucrats in Brussels. Good luck to him, and I hope he makes it (as
all the polls seem to be predicting) as the new President de la
Republique, a short step for a man of his stature from the Mayor's
office in Paris to the Elysee palace.
But there are other faces in France, uglier and devoted to
bureaucracy. Partisan in quite a different way from the courageous
Resistance fighters. However, we don't associate bureacracy with France,
home of chic. Bureaucrats are boring, dull people, short on imagination
and long on regulations. We forget that France has an immense system of
bureaucracy that stretches right down to village level. Each small town
or village has its own town hall, or mairie, and an elected mayor. A
proportion of taxes (council tax in France is divided between land and
dwelling) funds this structure which administers all kinds of things.
The permission of the mayor is required for all kinds of things.
Planning applications are one example.
Of course the mayor is a part-time post and the mairie has a
secretarial staff. This is where Madame A comes in. Like many of her
generation (menopausal but sometimes younger) she sits at a desk with a
word processor screen at an angle so that she can turn towards it while
dealing with you. The body language is essential. You are an intrusion,
an aside, to be spoken to with a turn of the head. She will not look up
when you enter the otherwise empty room and stand behind her counter.
That would be to render service. Instead she will continue to type, her
long fingernails making gentle clicks on the keyboard.
Eventually, she will turn with a whiff of perfume and a steely glint
in her eye as she listens to your petition, before mouthing that word
beloved of President De Gaulle: ''Non!'' Of course she will go on to say
why. The regulations, it is the regulations. The law. The prefecture at
department level. That is how it is in France, Monsieur (the implication
being that if you don't like you can always go back to where you came
from).
If this were really the case, then as a francophile I would respect
it. I admire the French culture, but not the ridiculous lengths which
many French people go to shut out any other culture except their own.
The pettifogging ban on English words in public discourse is but one
example. However, this is not about bureaucracy -- it is about status,
about the protection of France against intrusion by foreigners and,
above all, it is about xenophobia. The incident which sparked my latest
taste of it concerned a visa for my father-in-law who is Russian.
A few years ago a letter of invitation presented at the French embassy
in Moscow secured the visa. Then came new rules. A certificat
d'hebergement became necessary, approved by the mairie and paid for.
Although as the owner of a small property, I pay taxes to my local
mairie, I cannot apply for one. I must be a holder of residency. I have
now tried three mairies and three sets of kindly French residents have
tried to help me to obtain such a document. Each time the brutal
bureaucrats have knocked it back, each time with a different subterfuge.
The wrong form was issued so Moscow could say Non. The residency permit
wasn't in order. Now they want a birth certificate.
When I said I would get it (and provide a translation from the
Cyrillic script for good measure) Madame A swiftly changed the
goalposts. My father-in-law would not be staying at the neighbouring
farm, so the farmer and his wife would be signing ''on their honour''
something which was not true. She shrugged and her eyes glinted. She
knew she had me. Besides, what if there were an accident? You would be
held responsible . . . the pause, and the threat, hung in the air. What
about holding them responsible for the atrocities committed against
Napoleon as well? He had only popped into Russia for a vacation and they
froze him out.
The only justification for having such a local level of local
government is that people know one another and make it work with a human
face. The triumphant glint in the eye of that woman and other xenophobes
I have met in France is a nasty attitude which belittles all that is
wonderful about it. It is the same attitude which leads to thuggery by
farmers and fishermen, and unless it is officially frowned upon then it
leads to the growth of hatred and racism which eat at the fabric of any
society.
The difference between France and the UK on this issue is that we do
not tolerate abuse of our bureaucracy by those with the attitude of
Madame A. Policemen who looked on as trucks were tipped over would soon
be answering for their conduct to the Chief Constable. Yet as coverage
of the recent protests in France has shown, a blind eye is turned to
civil outrages committed by the French fascist element. Meanwhile the
borders of France are allegedly open to all EU citizens to trade and
move as they will.
A Europe of the people, indeed.

I SUPPOSE we shouldn't need reminded of Henry Purcell's genius. Anyone
who does will not be short of opportunities in this, the tercentenary of
his death. And there was a small-scale, but more than ample, occasion
yesterday lunchtime in the recital by Robert King's immaculate band of
instrumentalists, fronted by the great counter-tenor James Bowman.
We probably all heard Purcell's music in the bad old days when -- from
where? -- it was heavily clothed, weighed down by dense textures, and
ponderous on its feet. We know now that this was all baggage lumped onto
it centuries after his death. But just how light and fluid it is, as was
demonstrated consistently yesterday by Robert King's Consort, still
comes as a fresh surprise.
The instrumental music -- Suites from The Fairy Queen and Abdelazar --
fairly zinged by, vigorous, robust and energetic. And the great Chacony,
which was a favourite ''orchestral'' piece in the bad old days, soupily
played by zillions of strings, was weightless, pacy and, at the end,
incredibly wistful and poignant. Never was such a clear case made for
stripping off the varnish of the centuries.
James Bowman, his pearly tone at its luminous best, floated through a
spellbinding sequence of Purcell's songs that exemplified the
astonishing range of creative ingenuity that England's greatest composer
possessed. The sheer breadth: pathos, drama, and -- memorably in The
Knotting Song -- humour, provided a comprehensive survey of the emotions
within an hour. The exquisite warmth of the accompaniments, ravishingly
played by the consort, was unforgettable.

THE Gulf War, which ended the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, was a signal
success for its planners, mainly American, and those who executed their
instructions. These were also mainly American, but included
representatives of many other countries, something consonant with the
UN's oversight of the operation. Of these other countries, the largest
contingent came from the UK. The extent of the operation was enormous.
In retrospect, it was a sledgehammer to the proverbial nut, as the
Americans refused to take seriously Israeli assessments of poor Iraqi
military capacities. They used maximum force to ensure minimum
casualties, at least on the side of the coalition they led. They
certainly managed -- even on the Iraqi side casualties turned out to be
far fewer than was feared at the time, though, like all wars, this one
claimed its large quota of innocent and civilian victims.
Millions spent and the battle won, the Western powers at last relaxed
and returned their troops to their home bases. In subsequent months some
of these troops insisted that they suffered acute symptoms of distress,
including various degrees of physical debility, which were not easily
explained except by reference to their service. The psychological stress
of all war has been recognised since the experience of soldiers on both
sides of the Western front during the First World War. Modern warfare,
with its high technology and its use of many toxic materials in weapons
and their delivery systems, where the full consequences of handling and
usage are not yet fully understood, may have added new dimensions of
potential suffering. That actual symptoms of such conditions may take
time to manifest themselves is quite consistent with their insidious
nature. The US Army has certainly taken the matter seriously: the
British military authorities have not, although in our own case
relatively few soldiers seem to have suffered.
The reason might be the way in which there is no single set of
symptoms, more a variety of nasty reactions which the Americans were
quick to identify as a syndrome, a description which would fit something
hard to pin down but a medical reality none the less. The American
response is the right one, since such unfortunate outcomes may well be a
feature of any future hi-tech warfare where delayed (and not immediately
physical) casualties could increasingly be identified. The research
budgets which accompany the American attitude are not in themselves high
($10m next year) but by taking the matter seriously, American soldiers'
claims for compensation have to be taken seriously too. In this country,
a Gulf War military survivor with unusual symptoms has to be able to
prove they are specific to his service before help is forthcoming. A
Tory MP, Mr Peter Viggers, is insisting that the Ministry of Defence
follow the US example. His efforts deserve support. The contrast between
the millions spent on our contribution to Desert Storm and the far
smaller sums saved by denying help for suffering survivors, is an index
of institutional meanness, and should not be tholed.

WHEN we are little we have special friends. As we mature we develop
wider friendships of deeper significance with a greater range of people.
It is called growing up, and it is high time that Britain, in terms of
international relationships, did just that. The impetus for this,
admittedly splenetic, beginning is the latest whining over the demise of
the special relationship with the United States, and in particular with
President Clinton's risky gamble on the peacemaking inclinations of Mr
Adams. What is meant by a special relationship, and especially this one?
Presumably it should involve a community of interest, of language, and
of culture, if it is to fit in with the assumed and generally unspoken
understanding of the relationship which Britain is supposed to enjoy
with the United States. Then it should mean that the participating
nations treat each other with special consideration beacuse of what they
share. Mercifully we can leave language and culture out of the equation
as elements more likely to confuse than to clarify, but a community of
interest is a different matter. It is undeniable that Britain and the
United States hold a number of approaches to different subjects in
common. To take them at their most general, they would include a
commitment to open trade, to deeper security in Europe, to peace in the
Middle East, and to the prevention of the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. Each of these is a noble aim but, paradoxically, each could
be shared with anyone possessing enough moral sensibility to fill a
coffee-spoon.
The danger, and the disruption of cosy notions, is in the detail. On
the question of trade it is clear that Britain and the United States are
often at odds and in competition. Britain is part of Europe, whether the
Little Englanders like it or not. Some 53% of British exports go to the
EU, with 14% to North America (including our newly discovered, if in
fishy circumstances, long-lost cousins in Canada), and a mere 4% to
other leading industrialised countries. The United States is developing
an aggressive foreign economic policy which involves alliances with
other American nations and deeper involvement in the Pacific Rim. The EU
is a competitor, and we are part of the competition. Security in Europe
provides no comfort. In terms of political links, the United States has,
since the last days of the Bush administration, preferred to speak to
Bonn when it wants to deal with significant European nations. Mostly it
prefers to speak with the EU as a single voice.
Security in Europe is another example of general agreement but
particular divergence of opinion. Britain and the United States have
taken markedly different approaches to the war in former Yugoslavia,
reaching a low point in relations when the United States withdrew its
vessels blockading Bosnia. If the rumours are true, the US has taken
this further by covertly arming (or helping others to arm) the Bosnian
Muslims. Nor are relations between President Clinton and Mr Major even
mildly cordial. These factors represent an abiding fault-line between
the two governments. On the Middle-East and disarmament, we have
generally poodled after Washington, which constitutes a significant
mistake in areas and with peoples who value a distinctive voice. Adding
up the balance columns, there does not seem to be much of a special
relationship visible above water. Does this matter? The sensible,
grown-up answer must be that it doesn't matter in the least. This is
not, of course, a declaration of hostilities with the United States, or
even of huffiness of the sort displayed by Mr Major this week. Rather,
it is a recognition that relations between Britain and the United States
can be sensitive, creative, friendly, and mutually beneficial, but only
if elements in this country stop the foolish pretence that they are
special, or even that they should be.

William Russell pays tribute to a heroine of the Second World War
ODETTE HALLOWES, GC, who died last Monday aged 82, apparently wanted
no fuss made about her passing. A profoundly modest, although very
determined person, she did not want her death to provide an excuse for
opening-up old wounds. It was not announced by her family until after
her funeral held at Walton on Thames, Surrey, on Thursday, where she
lived with her third husband, Geoffrey Hallowes.
The first woman to be awarded the George Cross, she was one of the
heroines of the Second World War. She was sent into occupied France by
the Special Operations Executive in 1942 to set up a resistance unit at
Auxerre, but was captured a few months later.
Tortured by the Gestapo over a two-year period, she refused to reveal
anything she knew and was eventually condemned to death. Instead she
remained in Ravensbruck concentration camp until her release in April
1945.
The daughter of a French bank manager who was killed at Verdun, Odette
Marie Celine Brailly was born in Amiens in April 1912. For a period
during her early childhood she was almost blind, an experience which she
later said helped her cope with her imprisonment in Ravensbruck. In 1931
she married an Englishman, Roy Sansom, by whom she had three daughters,
and they moved to England the following year.
When war broke out she joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, known as
FANY, in 1940. In the spring of 1942, after she responded to a request
by the War Office in a BBC broadcast for photographs of the French
coastline, she came to the attention of the SOE to whom, despite her
daughters, aged six, five, and two, as a native French speaker married
to an English officer, she appeared the perfect recruit.
In November 1942 she was landed by boat in the South of France with
instructions to set up a Resistance unit at Auxerre.
She next worked as a courier for a unit in Cannes run by Captain Peter
Churchill. In early 1943 the unit was betrayed to the Gestapo and
Churchill and Mrs Sansom were taken prisoner. As part of their cover
story they pretended to be married and that he was a relative of the
Prime Minister, a story she stood by during 14 interrogations over the
next two years.
She was held at the notorious Fresnes prison in Paris, and as part of
the torture her toenails were pulled out and she was branded with a
red-hot iron. The Gestapo, which wanted the names of two other agents,
eventually gave up and she was sent to Ravensbruck.
Her marriage to Roy Sansom ended during the war and in 1947 she
married Captain Churchill. That marriage lasted until 1953, and three
years later she married Hallowes, a wine importer, who had also served
in the SOE. In 1945 she was appointed an MBE. The George Cross was
awarded the following year, and in 1950 she was awarded the Legion
d'Honneur.
The citation for the George Cross said that ''by her bravery and
determination she not only saved the life of the two officers, but also
enabled them to carry out their most valuable work.''
Talking about the work of the torturers she later said that there were
merciful limits to humanity's capacity for suffering. ''You can endure
so much and no more, for your senses become numbed and cease to react to
pain.
''The one thing that holds to the end is your own will. How strong the
reserves upon which you draw are you never realise until you need them,
but, believe me, they do not fail you.''
In 1950 Anna Neagle, with whom she became friendly, gave one of her
finest performances playing her in the celebrated film Odette. Although
the effectiveness of the work done by the SOE was criticised by
Professor M R D Foot in his official account of the organisation -- she
was very upset by what he wrote -- he did not question her bravery.
Nobody could.

Alastair Scott goes
back in time to the
preservation island of
Easdale, one-time
centre of the Scottish
slate industry
There remains just
the menace of a BT
door and the great
holes where the
island is missing
APART from the raucous disputes of seagulls and the sounds of the last
ferry being tied up, the silence that descends on the small island of
Easdale at 9pm is absolute. There are no cars and no generators to break
it. As windows gradually light up along the rows of attached cottages,
each window becomes a different theatre of still life, some fired by the
saffron glow of a Tilley lamp. The atmosphere is that of a castle with
its drawbridge up, a sanctuary of cosiness and privacy.
''Please do not open the door,'' warns a notice stuck to one of the
island's two telephone booths. ''It may fall on you.'' The hazard of
being crushed by an errant slab of material is apparently just as real
today as it was last century when Easdale held sway as the centre of the
Scottish slate industry. Between the years 1842-61, when production
peaked and 140 million slates were shipped away, 450 people inhabited
the island they were rapidly dismantling.
Today Easdale has a winter population of 50. That common west coast
malaise, white settler nausea, is refreshingly absent, for they are all
incomers. Half of them are English, half are predominantly
ex-Glaswegians, and half are retired. Employment comes through council
services, ferry, post, shellfish, pub, crafts, and the annual excavation
of the harbour which the sea faithfully fills in with dross slate dumped
by the old quarriers.
The quarry ceased operating in 1911. No more the sounds of explosions,
the danger of falling rocks; there remains just the menace of a British
Telecom door and the great holes where the island is missing.
Easdale lies to the south of Oban, 16 miles away by road and roughly a
century away in environment. The time warp is not apparent during the
journey across Seil Island, which starts with the most renowned humpback
bridge in the land, the ''Bridge over the Atlantic'', and ends at
Ellanbeich.
Here it is worth pausing to visit the Highland Arts Studio, not to buy
anything but to marvel at 100 yards of tea-towels in a treasure trove of
tawdriness. Meet proprietor, self-acclaimed poet, and dishcloth magnate
C John Taylor, who offers his verse -- most appropriately -- for the
service of dirty dishes.
Easdale's 12-person ferry is the only ferry in Scotland to be on
immediate call during the day. It operates as a water taxi. If it's not
waiting for you at the pier a sign invites you to sound a klaxon and
moments later it'll come scuttling across the 100 yards of water that
separate Easdale from Ellanbeich. For admission to another world the
fare of 80p return is cheap.
The island is a preservation area and justly proud of its appearance.
Cottages are laid out in a cluster of long rows around the harbour,
leaving the rest of the island unoccupied. They are all either
whitewashed or of bare stone and every roof, naturally, is of slate. The
cultivated flowers that add splashes of colour here and there thrive on
Irish soil, for every pound of earth was imported, brought as ballast by
the ships that took away the slates. There are no roads, just tracks
through the meadow grasses which grow rank through the absence of
livestock.
The harbour, whose exquisite masonry is reminiscent of Inca handiwork,
provides a fitting backdrop for the Para Handy puffer Eilean Eisdeal,
which is frequently berthed here. Once hotching with trade, now the
harbour sees little more activity than visiting yachts and the tidal
antics of rotting hulks. Like the rest of Easdale it is simply tranquil,
a nook overlooked by visitors and owner alike.
If the island's absentee owner had had his way, the population would
all be wearing kilts. This was the stated hope of Clive Feigenbaum when
he added Easdale to his (Gibbons) stamp interests four years ago, but
the idea met with zero enthusiasm. The only tartan on show is supported
by pins rather than a waist and hangs in the community's museum, which
is a model of excellence.
It would be wrong to judge the native character by the fact that the
island bell was last rung at the end of the Falklands war, nor by the
opening hours of the pub; for Easdale is, above all, a friendly place.
The Puffer Bar opens on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The
Fishkettle Restaurant and tearoom opens normal hours in season, and
erratically outwith.
Without any stops to contemplate historical relics, wildlife, or
flowers, a walk round Easdale can be completed in 30 minutes. Slate
quarrying began here in the year of our Charlie, 1745, and over the
years much of the island was reduced to near sea-level. With the advent
of pumps, slate was then quarried deep below the level of the sea. The
great storm of 1881 flooded these pits beyond repair, and they remain as
square-cut ponds of eerie lifelessness. Around them lie a desert of
broken slates, abandoned buildings and machinery, and the pits where
pairs of splitters found shelter from the wind as they chapped away.
Across the island runs a ridge of whinstone. It defeated the quarriers
and provides a magnificent viewpoint. One evening I stood there and
watched storm clouds rolling in. Below, cottage windows were lighting up
and behind them I imagined a reclusive world of Gunns, Orwells, and
MacGill-Eains harvesting their thoughts. To the west, Mull. To the north
and south, the isles of the Firth of Lorne. To the east . . . bustle,
cars, and dishcloths.

HAVING been treated to one Tosca this month, Scotland was last night
treated to another. Perhaps treat is the wrong word. These were touring
productions of the old kind, with variable voices, rudimentary stagings,
cut-down orchestras, stilted English translations, and the perpetual
risk of mishap.
Framed within yards and yards of black masking, the London Opera
Players' production seemed intended for homelier surroundings than the
square, steeply-raked, rather characterless Rothes Hall. This was not a
Tosca whose aim was to re-create the atmosphere of the grand Roman
buildings in which Puccini set his opera, but one which was domestically
scaled to the size of an Italian village chapel.
This did rather cramp the action -- the cast had so little room to
move that they all appeared to have gone lame -- but once you got used
to it, the performance became more credible. Nevertheless, both visually
and vocally it was all desperately stiff. According to the printed
programme, the company has been running for 45 years, and though the
figures were of more recent vintage they all seemed locked in a
time-warp.
Margaret Pearman's Tosca came closest to a real portrayal. Nicholas
Buxton's Cavaradossi was very strained, and Glyn Paul's furry-toned
Scarpia lacked menace.
To find the veteran Peter Gellhorn in charge of the 12-piece orchestra
was all the same a welcome surprise. At the age of 83 he has the
experience of many a Covent Garden performance behind him, and it
showed.

OH dear. Just as ENO was beginning to show signs of returning to its
old dynamic form, it delivers a production as directionless as the Tory
Party. Don Giovanni is dramma giocoso, not opera buffa, but that hasn't
stopped Belgian director Guy Joosten from indulging in clumsy visual
jokes and limp characterisations. The fundamental inquiry behind this
great piece, about obstinacy, sin and the saving power of redemption, is
shamefully ignored.
Thank goodness for the voices of this cast, all full of tone and
exquisitely clear. Peter Coleman-Wright is a thoroughly convincing Don.
Urban Malmberg's Leporello is a promising voice that needs a touch more
experience. Penelope Walmsley-Clark as Donna Anna is not the finest
actress, but her voice is wondrous. And Janice Watson's beautifully-sung
Donna Elvira is reduced from the opera's pivotal conscience to a
whingeing bore.
I liked the backdrop of giant stage flats painted with sections of
Caravaggio women, scribbled over with the names of great opera babes.
But the fornicating extras and clumsy stage-work -- when John Hudson's
smooth Don Ottavio sings ''let me help you up'' to a Donna Anna who is
supposed to have fainted, she is still fully conscious and 20ft away --
were annoying.
The ending is sadly mishandled. The Commendatore appears in the shape
of the Don's double -- but only for a moment. The fatal handshake has to
be imagined, and the Commendatore's voice comes amplified from somewhere
off-stage. The Don isn't dragged into hell, he just falls into it. Then
the stage hands come on to tidy up while our bewildered-looking cast
tries valiantly to make sense of the mess. No wonder there were boos.

Whether seen as a sign of psychotic bankruptcy or just a symbol of
cheap success, grunge says Anvar Khan is for proles who don't have the
moolah to look like class
GRUNGE is The Cult of Failure -- the uniform worn by the rich and
self-made who want to look like losers on their days off. To them,
grunge is the perfect foil for fame. For those who wear it for real,
however, it's a sign of innate distress.
Grunge is in complete polarity to Hollywood; it represents cheap,
psychotic bankruptcy, as opposed to cheap, psychotic success. Grunge is
gear for victims. The impoverished look allegedly emerged in Seattle,
America, where street kids thought it cool to look like dossers.
Whatever vague statement of rebellion cult fashion pitches to, grunge
hit the headlines for representing the guilty side of achievement. The
''I don't deserve it, it's all bull anyway'' brigade as led by
Seattle-born suicide, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. He was a popular man, who,
despite being able to command large audiences and epic fees, looked as
if he washed his clothes twice a month from a public toilet soap
dispenser.
As soon as grunge, an amalgam of the tatty, tired, and second-hand,
was adopted by the stars, it became a statement of not belonging. In
real life grunge is an emblem of low self-esteem.
While this is less of a problem in the galaxy of Hollywood than we are
led to believe by the plethora of personal shrinks available in that
area (look, psychotherapists are just nannies for adults), it became
trendy to impersonate someone down on their luck. Grunge became the
self-conscious art of underselling oneself on purpose.
Trying to be invisible while employed as paparazzi fodder has always
been a problem to the new generation of film stars until this option of
being able to dress down to obscurity. The previous generations wanted
to be extraordinary.
Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner didn't want to appear as real people.
Neither did Barbara Stanwyck or Lauren Bacall. Looking casual was for
proles who didn't have the moolah to flaunt class. It was shameful to be
seen to be unmade-up or scruffy.
An actresses's job was to provide glamour for the consumption of a
public besotted with star quality. Ordinariness, mortality, was for
behind closed doors.
It may be that grunge is a direct backlash to power-dressing; the
boardroom rule that to get on you must look halfway there. In this case,
followers of grunge deserve contempt. Only hippies try to make
anti-materialistic, cultural statements about society by opting out of
High Street fashion. Grunge devotees have the same snobbery as the
average, university-educated intellectual, that dressing-up indicates a
weakness of mind or spirit.
No-one becomes a movie star because she wants to be an average person
and this still holds true today. But Hollywood's beautiful, in a
gargantuan and simple-minded effort to reveal themselves as
well-balanced, psychologically and emotionally fulfilled individuals,
suffer from the need to be judged on what they are, not what they seem.
What they seem is box-office. What they are (boring) is presented to
us on their days off, and the paying public are asked to accept both
faces. Unlike Monroe and Loren, actors Cruise, Redford or Roberts feel
they have a right to prove that they are just like everyone else.
To become a ''real'' human being with a ''real'' life, one has to have
working-class credentials. Hollywood is currently full of neds, the
nouveau riche, what the Americans call white trash. This has made it all
the easier for grunge to infiltrate otherwise very expensive wardrobes.
Grunge is arrogant, as implied by this current American joke: How do
you judge the wealth of a white-trash family? By the number of household
appliances on the porch.
In this example from Today newspaper, popular culture's most
influential and self-serving icons, the pop star and the supermodel
parade Beavis-and-Butthead cool: ''First to dare to face their public in
London's West End were Michael Hutchence and Danish Helena Christiansen.
The 35-year-old INXS singer resembled a car mechanic.
''Not to be outdone in the grunge stakes, Helena, 24, wore a sickly
pink dress covered with a cropped woolly jumper. And just as the
matching highlights in their hair were quite startling, so was the fact
that between them they do not seem to possess a comb.''
Grunge types refuse to aspire. On the successful, grunge is fake, mere
gesture dressing, a notion of being civilian. On Generation X, the
drop-outs, the lost and aimless youth, it is a statement of complete and
utter cynicism . . . been there, said it, done it. The grunge mind-set
dictates that it's not fashionable to be impressed by anything or
anyone.
Whether grunge is a question of self-punishment or not, it still looks
naff. It's regressive. Success is not a costume, it's a way of life. If
you want to make enough money to look like a bag lady, become one.
There is no great difference between the middle-aged vegging out, and
the young and the beautiful not making the effort . . . except for the
obvious truism, that the older and more decayed women get, the more they
have to dress up.
The best way to draw attention to youthful beauty is to dress in a
sack. Fashion has always worked on this premise. Girls have grunge,
women are consoled by Chanel.

WHEN dole clerk Kenneth McAllister goes to the World Cup qualifier
between Northern Ireland and Ireland in Belfast in November 1993 and
hears ''Trick or Treat'' whistling round the ground, his life begins to
change forever. For Protestant and Loyalist McAllister suddenly tumbles
to the inhumanity that lodges in sectarian bigotry as his Belfast
colleagues taunt the southern visitors with echoes of the words
spattered like bullets in a bar in County Derry a few weeks earlier when
six Catholics were murdered.
From that moment on McAllister's world is on the move and the strength
of Marie Jones's A Night in November is how she shows us this
transformation in the context of the all-Ireland following of ''Jackie's
Army'' in World Cup-fevered New York. Jones's writing, as with the best
of her earlier work with the Belfast-based Charabanc Company is full of
humour and passionate, painful engagement. Dan Gordon's dynamic solo
performance as both the emerging Kenneth and his tight-lipped
''cleanliness is next to Godliness'' kith and kin, his Catholic boss,
''the lads'' and their female camp followers in New York.
The first half lumbers a bit as Jones and director Pam Brighton fill
in the domestic Protestant background with all its petty snobberies. But
the second half scenes of realisation are a gas. World Cup fever is
conjured up in all its ecstasy and anarchic joy. And when Kenneth, at
the end, is able to declare himself both an Irishman and a Protestant,
this escapist thrill comes to mean far more than just a football match.
Not a dry eye in the house.

POSITIVELY festooned with early music was the Academy yesterday.
Following the super-refined Purcell concert by the King's Consort
yesterday afternoon, the altogether-earthier Scots took the stage last
night. Before they did, another concert took place in the foyer of the
RSAMD, a raunchy, exuberant affair featuring the Cattach Consort --
children from Golspie High School who are travelling round the country
this week with the SEMC, providing foyer medieval music. Good stuff.
Then on to them indoors. Time was, early music attracted four guys in
sandals and a critic. Times change: packed house last night for the
programme entitled Coffee and a Blaze of Trumpets, though the trumpets
concerned experienced a little plumbing problem last night.
Still, a good programme, with dollops of humour and entertainment, not
least from group leader Greg Squire in the Sonata Representativa by
Heinrich Biber -- more an instrumental zoo than a sonata, and an early
piece of musical pictorialism.
Bach got sent up too last night in Hugh Macdonald's wicked translation
of the Coffee Cantata, featuring Mr Maxwell, his house, his daughter
Ness, and every conceivable atrocious pun on coffee, mate. Singers Alan
Watt and Julie Moffat virtually decaffeinated themselves with effort.
The latter, a fresh-voiced, pure-toned soprano, then featured in the
glorious cantata Jauchzet Gott, which moved at a spanking pace, though
she hasn't yet quite got the controlled virtuosity required. Alan Watt,
consummately professional, inimitably characterful, and equipped with
robe, lantern and concealed hip flask, rounded off the proceedings with
a delightful little Biber miniature accompanied by plucked strings. Same
show St Paul's, Dundee, tomorrow.

You too can avoid being left on the shelf if you steer your trolley in
the right circles. Sara Villiers reports on frozen foods and warm hearts
in the supermarkets
''I met him in the candy store.''
THE hype which greeted Asda's recent announcement that they were to
begin ''singles nights'' at their supermarkets in Watford and
Bedminster, Bristol, suggested that this was a new and unique angle on
the mating game but clearly, as a Shangrila crooned of her one true
love, the Leader of the Pack, way back in the sixties, picking someone
up while picking up the shopping is really not that unusual. Mind you,
getting chatted up in a choc shop does seem more romantic than being
propositioned by the pickles.
But this is the nineties and pragmatism rules the day. With people in
their twenties and thirties either postponing marriage indefinitely or
discovering that it's not for them and speeding through the divorce
courts to return to the singles market, Britain boasts a booming singles
population.
Young people are increasingly likely to move away from family and
friends to relocate for jobs which often provide few opportunities for
social interaction. And ''the dancing,'' that age-old dating ground, is
no longer an ideal venue for romance; research has proven that very few
people meet the partner of their dreams in a nightclub.
So, if you've not yet waltzed down the aisle why not check out the
aisles of the supermarket? It makes perfect sense and has infinite
advantages over a seething, sweaty club. You can stroll around at your
leisure, chat to someone who catches your eye without competing with
mega-decibels of bass, and the bright lights ensure you won't be
appalled by your choice at the end of the night. After all, most of us
tend to be sober and sensible in the supermarket.
Although there's nothing very sensible about Asda's plans to entice
lonely hearts into their designated supermarkets on the singles' nights.
They're frivolous in the extreme; shops are decked out in fairy lights,
staff wear dinner jackets and affect introductions and smoochy music
plays over the loudspeakers as single shoppers, identified by carnation
buttonholes and name tags, are encouraged to team up for free coffee and
cakes at candlelit tables.
The first singles night was an unmitigated success at Bedminster. ''It
exceeded our wildest expectations, with a fantastic turnout,'' says
store manager Eric Sortwell. And was romance in the air? ''There is no
question about that. One couple who met had a very long romantic chat in
the store restaurant.''
Paula Mackenzie, a 29-year-old secretary from Edinburgh, admits that
these days she tends to tart herself up a bit for a trip to the shops --
''Well, I freshen up my lipstick'' -- and does consider the supermarket
a potential man-market but says she wouldn't feel comfortable going
along to designated singles nights.
''It would seem really desperate,'' she reckons. ''If someone slapped
a name tag on me, I think I'd run out the door. At my local supermarket
there are definitely times when it's full of singles; if you go in there
after six on the way home from work, you practically have to fight your
way through to the Lean Cuisine cabinet, and I have got into
conversation with guys, but there's a big difference between being
flirty and announcing you're available. Singles nights sound like a bit
of a cynical marketing ploy.''
Eric Sortwell contends that while the novelty nights are good for
business it's very much a case of giving the customers what they want.
''It's all done in good taste and we don't impose on anybody. We've had
lots of phone calls congratulating us and asking if it will be a regular
thing, which it will.
''A supermarket is a very safe place to meet. It's much easier to
start a conversation, about products or cooking, and women on their own
feel more comfortable initiating a conversation than they would in a
bar.''
The singles nights have proven so popular that Scottish branches of
Asda are joining in. The Asda branch at The Forge Shopping Centre,
Parkhead, launched its first Scottish supermarket singles night from 6pm
to 8pm on Wednesday.
''We have soft music and designated erogenous hot spots beside the
ready-made meals and the sparkling wine, with staff dishing out their
last Rolos,'' explains manager Brian Fichi. ''We often take a lead from
the US and Wednesday nights are a big singles night over there. We know
from our research that we have a lot of singles shopping here and we
want to add to their shopping experience.''
Twenty-four year old Julie Ford has been asked out in the supermarket,
at the Byres Road Safeway in Glasgow, which, located in an area full of
rented accommodation, heaves with single shoppers in the evening.
''I was trying to decide between different types of cat food and this
guy beside me told me to buy Felix, that's what his cat liked. We had a
bit of a laugh about the price of cat litter and then I think we both
contrived to 'accidentally' end up next to each other in a long
check-out queue. While we were waiting he asked me for a drink so we
popped into the pub next door.''
Didn't she feel nervous going out with a stranger? ''Not really. It
was a busy pub and not far from my home and he wasn't at all pushy. It
would have been easy to call it quits at any time. We actually had quite
a fun night and I didn't get home until after 11 -- by which time my cat
was bloody starving.''
The biggest fun about supermarket flirtations is checking out the
contents of other shoppers' trolley loads. Furtive glances can tell a
lot about the likely lifestyle of the man or woman you fancy; a nice
bottle of wine can impress although a trolley full of booze should
trigger warning bells, while the chap who is buying a basket full of
delicatessen delicacies is obviously the discerning -- and minted --
type but stay clear of the man stocking up on Pampers.
I used to feel cynical about the lovelorn lyrics of Del Amitri until I
stood behind lead singer Justin Currie in a supermarket queue some years
ago and glanced at his shopping; any man buying two steaks, a good
bottle of red wine, masses of salad and fresh herbs just had to be a
full-blown romantic.
But while you can surmise superficial details from a person's victuals
there is a limit to what you can check out at the check-out. Even Julie
Ford's fun night out didn't lead to an on-going relationship and in
similar circumstances, at the same shop and same pub, Alan Mabbott's
supermarket date was a disaster.
''I chatted up this girl waiting at the delicatessen counter and
persuaded her to come for a drink with me but it was awful -- we had
nothing to say to each other. It turned out that apart from a liking for
peppered salami we had absolutely nothing in common with each other.''
That said, he'd have no qualms about trying the same tactics again.
''Nothing ventured, nothing gained,'' shrugs Mabbott, 32. ''At least
it's easy to tell if the girl has a boyfriend or not -- if she's buying
meals for one, then she's probably up for it.'' He grins cheekily:
''Judging by the amount of eye signals going on, I'd say that the
supermarket is the modern-day equivalent of what used to be called the
'cattle market'.''

His mother wanted him to be like everyone else, but Man Ray just
couldn't manage that. And, as Liz Taylor explains, his incredible
legacy, which is to be sold at Sotheby's in March, testifies to his
incredible talents
THERE'S almost too much to be said about Man Ray because in the course
of his long life, 86 years, he distinguished himself in a wide variety
of fields -- drawing, sculpting, object-making, and photography. As if
all that was not enough, he also wrote poetry.
When he died in 1976, a vast archive was left in the care of his widow
Juliet who died in Paris in 1991. Her family are now disposing of
everything at Sotheby's in London in a huge two-day sale on March 22 and
23. It is sure to attract a huge interest because there are 597 lots
listed in a catalogue that is as thick as a textbook and the value will
be immense because it is hard to find a single lot with an estimated
price of less than #1000.
Man Ray, real name Emmanual Radnitzsky, was born in Philadelphia in
1890, and studied at the National Academy of Design in New York. He
didn't change his name to the catchy Man Ray until 1912 but once he did,
his career took off and he began mixing with the avant-garde artists and
writers among whom he was to move for the rest of his life.
He was one of the first to embrace the new Dada movement, started in
Zurich around 1915 by artists Arp and Tzara, and he attempted to
introduce it to New York but it was too shocking for most materialistic
minded Americans, who were disconcerted by the Dadaist concept of
anti-aestheticism.
The word Dada means ''hobby horse'' and the Dadaists were against
''artistic'' art and in favour of the whimsical, meaningless, and
shocking. Their aim was to undermine the commercial market for art and
create new ways of ''looking''. Man Ray would have approved of the sort
of art that shows dead sheep in vats of formaldehyde.
In 1921 he left the USA for Paris where his sort of art was more
appreciated and there he started to make his name as a photographer,
taking portrait studies of the more avant-garde people in the Bohemian
society of the city but also contributing fashion photographs to Vogue
(surely an anti-Dadaist way of making a living?).
The second phase of his life and career came after 1940 when he moved
to Hollywood. He stayed in America for the next 11 years, during which
he married his second wife, a dancer called Juliet Browner who had
studied modern dance under Martha Graham.
His first marriage was in 1914 to a girl called Adon Lacroix, to whom
he dedicated a collection of poems entitled ''Adonism''. She had
disappeared from his life by 1919 and during his first sojourn in Paris
he had a series of mistresses ranging from Lee Miller, the American
photographer, to a pert model who called herself Kiki de Montparnasse,
though her real name was the less glamorous Alice Prin. It was Kiki who
posed for Man Ray's most famous photograph, Le Violin d'Ingres, showing
her naked back painted with the two curlicue ''f'' holes of a violin at
the waist.
There is a silver copy print of this photograph, signed and dated
''Man Ray 1924'', in Sotheby's sale and it carries the astonishing
estimate of between #20,000 and #30,000.
In 1946 Man Ray and Juliet had a double wedding in Beverly Hills with
Max Ernst, the Dadaist painter and sculptor, and his wife Dorothea
Tanning, and in 1951 they moved to Paris where they were to remain for
the rest of their lives. During their time together he took a series of
wonderful photographs of the beautiful Juliet, perhaps the most striking
of which showed her in the guise of a Spanish dancer.
This photograph is also in the sale at around #5000, as is an oil
painting based on it. This painting is entitled Celeste est a l'Est de
l'Ouest, which Sotheby's catalogue does not attempt to explain. The
estimated price, however, is unequivocal -- between #35,000 and #45,000.
During Man Ray's second time in Paris his reputation grew and he
became an icon for the trendiest artists. Andy Warhol devoted a series
of paintings to him in 1974.
The trouble with being as original and talented as Man Ray is that it
is difficult to select the aspect of his art which is most likely to
endure.
The wit and skill shown in his paintings and his clever ''objects''
like the metronomes with painted eyes, and the hollowed-out banjo with a
magnifying glass and a yellow rubber ball hanging behind it in the banjo
heart so that the ball swells and diminishes as it is swung to and fro,
is undeniable but perhaps his greatest claim to posthumous fame lies in
the photography.
He has left a gallery of some of the most remarkable people of the
twentieth century . . . Jean Cocteau, photographed in 1926; Andre
Derain; Picasso with his baby son Paolo in 1922. Picasso was one of the
first people to commission Man Ray in Paris because he needed good
photographs of his paintings and the relationship lasted for many years
with pictures of Picasso cropping up throughout the Man Ray archive. One
of the most impressive is a silver print profile of the artist, taken in
1932 (estimate around #10,000).
Other famous names immortalised by Man Ray include James Joyce looking
pensive; Lee Miller, sprawled in sleep on a studio floor; Elsa
Schiaparelli; Peggy Guggenheim in a sequinned gown with an enormously
long cigarette holder in her hand; Juan Gris and Georges Braque.
Some of the most stunning photo portraits are those of Gertrude Stein,
taken in 1922 and 1929. When Picasso painted her portrait she was
outraged because it did not flatter her, but Man Ray's photographs show
how well Picasso caught his subject. The most mannish Gertrude Stein
photograph is one of the less expensive in the sale because it is
estimated at around #1200.
A photograph that is even more modestly priced -- at about #500 --
shows Man Ray's mother, Mrs Radnitzsky, taken in 1945, the year of her
death. She stares out of the print, humorously resigned, slightly
disapproving, and he said that she never really approved of his career .
. . ''She wanted me to be like other people -- and I couldn't.''
But if he could, his work wouldn't be up for sale at Sotheby's, would
it?

HERE'S an interesting thought for those who care about Mother's Day.
Instead of the usual bouquet of flowers or unwanted box of chocolates,
how about helping to introduce some real independent ''care'' into her
life in the form of professional help? The idea applies, of course, only
to those mums who are disabled, elderly, or otherwise in need of extra
attention. But it is a good one -- an innovative vouchers scheme,
believe it or not, which deserves close scrutiny.
Scot Home Care, a division of Scotnursing Ltd of Bearsden, has come up
with the vouchers concept in recognition of the fact that many people
are wary of private care, on grounds not only of cost but of fear of
commitment. Its caring voucher dispels both worries at a stroke. First,
the cost of an hour or so's private care will come as a pleasant
surprise. Second, the recipient of a voucher (and they are available for
non-Mother's Day periods) decides when and how to use it.
An idea on the cost front is given by the fact that you can buy a
#6.50 voucher.
That provides an hour's care under the voucher scheme -- slightly
cheaper than normal charges as the usual administration fee is waived.
And it is amazing what one of Scot Home Care's people can do in 60
minutes flat.
''We have regular clients who have us in for only an hour or so at a
time,'' says Ann Rushforth, managing director of Scotnursing.
''Sometimes it is at bedtime, in which case the patient can be bathed,
have his or her hair done, be given a sandwich, and put to bed.
''Or maybe it's at lunchtime. Again it is a similar routine, with
perhaps a lunch made and a spot of hoovering done.''
Carers are an admirable blend of home help and personal-care
providers. They will do housework, keep the client company, take the dog
for a walk, or go for the messages. They are multi-skilled, but should
expert medical or nursing advice be needed, a registered nurse is on
duty at the Bearsden headquarters 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The service provided could not be more flexible. It is the client who
decides when the carer should come: there is no waiting around for hours
for someone to arrive. And should it turn out that she is not needed on
a particular day, the arrangement can be cancelled at a few hours'
notice.
By the same token, a carer can be brought in at short notice, and
nursing care can be obtained on lifting a telephone.
This is one of the advantages of the Scotnursing set-up: qualified
help is on hand round the clock, and the service dovetails with
statutory services. Should help be needed in deciding if a doctor is
required, it is able to advise. If the overnight services of a carer or
nurse are required, this is immediately arranged.
''Many people draw back from private care because they are afraid of
entering into a long-term commitment,'' says Mrs Rushforth. ''With Scot
Home Care there is no such worry.
''A home-care manager goes to a new client's home to discuss what
might be needed, how frequently a carer should come, and at what times
she should come.
''In the case of people who need a hand at bathtime, not everyone
wants to be bathed and put to bed at eight o clock. We don't exactly
flinch from the idea of people going to bed after midnight.''
The vouchers scheme, which runs all year, gives relatives and friends
the opportunity to introduce a person to Scot Home Care's service
without feeling the commitment has already been made. ''It's a bit
better than something that just gets flung into a cupboard,'' says Ann
Rushforth. ''My own mum has an Aladdin's cave of toiletries which will
never be used, and I am sure plenty of other mothers will be adding to
their collections a week tomorrow.''
And yet, private care at cost-effective rates such as this can often
allow someone to stay at home as opposed to going into a nursing home
where there is no say as regards the staff who will look after them, the
mealtimes, the bathtimes, or the bedtimes.
''Clients of Scot Home Care retain all the independence of living at
home, with meals, baths, and hour of retiring a matter of their own
choice,'' says Mrs Rushforth.
''Also, we send carefully vetted staff from their local area and try
to suit them to the client and to the tasks in hand. But should that not
work out, or should the client wish to change the carer, that is done
without any hard feelings.
''I personally feel it is a fundamental right to decide who is going
to enter one's own home. We make sure that people's independence is
respected.''

* NOW that it seems as if fox-hunting might be on its way out, the
collecting market is turning its attention to huntsmen's trappings. At a
sale in Taunton last month, a collection of hunt buttons went for #242;
a saddle flask in a leather holster made #150 and a Swaine and Adeney
hunting horn fetched #55. Look out for more hunting artefacts in
salerooms soon.

RESIDENTS of Dunfermline, who are angry at the prospect of an opencast
coalmine on their doorsteps, will take to the footpaths today in an
organised protest march to save a right of way.
They say it is being staged to highlight the strength of feeling
against an application by mining group R &amp; D Beattie of Wishaw to mine
land between East and West Baldridge Farms on the north side of the Fife
town.
The right of way, said protest group Raboc -- Residents Against The
Baldridge Opencast -- traditionally provides a link between the villages
of Parkneuk and Wellwood.
Yesterday, one of the organisers, Mrs Lesley Ratomska, said: ''Local
residents are incensed that the proposed mining application will remove
the right of way as it currently is, and reinstate it in a different
location, as well as ripping out 100-year-old hawthorn hedging and
threatening the existence of oak and beech woods besides other flora and
fauna.''
A petition with 1200 signatures has already been obtained by the
group, which says that the proximity of the site to houses is
unacceptable, because residents fear for their health from dust and
noise.
Coal has been mined in an area honeycombed with old mine workings for
hundreds of years.
Mrs Ratomska added: ''The unpredictability of previous mine working
and unmarked shafts is giving residents cause for concern about any
structural problems that might arise, and affect existing housing and
ground bordering the site.''
She said the protest group would continue to keep the issue of
opencast mining at the forefront of the minds of the people of
Dunfermline.
A spokesman for Dunfermline District Council's planning department
said yesterday that the company's application would probably be
considered on March 28 by the planning committee.
Mr Danny Beattie, a partner in the mining company, said it was
intended to pursue the application despite the local reaction.

These are not good times for the special relationship, reports Patrick
Brogan from Washington
THE photographers had left the room when Bill Clinton met Gerry Adams
on Thursday. They shook hands warmly and talked for five minutes, and
the fact that the encounter was not recorded for the ages was small
consolation for the British Government.
John Major and his Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir
Patrick Mayhew, had gone to extraordinary lengths to dissuade the
President from receiving the Sinn Fein leader and allowing him to raise
funds for the party in the United States.
The President's decision was a public rebuff for the Prime Minister,
and when Mr Major protested yet again, that, too, was brushed aside.
These are not good times for the special relationship.
Mr Clinton likes Britain well enough. He spent a year at Oxford, and
retains many British friends and, more important, many Anglophile
American friends. His administration remains filled with Rhodes
scholars.
But he evidently cares nothing at all for Mr Major's political
problems, for him personally, or for his Government. The President's
Irish policy, described as the carrot and the carrot, is designed to
wean Sinn Fein and the IRA permanently away from terrorism. It has been
a success so far and is perhaps well-considered and intelligent. But the
way the British were treated is another matter.
The Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, and the rest of the
foreign policy establishment, argued unsuccessfully that however much
Britain's status in the world has declined, it is not really in
America's interests to offend the British Government so deeply in order
to win the favour of a small section of opinion in a much smaller and
less important community, Northern Ireland, or even for the sake of the
Irish-American vote.
The United States needs all the support it can get for its vacillating
and uncertain policy in ex-Yugoslavia. It needs the British vote in the
Security Council to maintain sanctions against Iraq. There are always
trade and political issues between America and Europe in which the
United States needs friends in Brussels.
Mr Clinton's reply is that, as far as Europe goes, Germany is so much
more important that Britain doesn't count, and in any event Britain has
lost all its authority in Brussels thanks to the Little England
xenophobia of the Thatcherites.
It is all rather humiliating. Ronald Reagan never treated Margaret
Thatcher like this. On the contrary, he always consulted her, he
appeared to defer to her. When, in fact, he was going flat against her
advice, he never let on.
He ordered the invasion of Grenada, a former British colony, without
informing London, but that was smoothed over. Things are different now.
The United States has made a conscious decision that in the future its
relations with East Asia and South America are going to be more
important than its relations with Europe.
The North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) is in eclipse at the
moment, because of the sudden collapse of the Mexican economy, but there
can be no doubt that Mexico will revive and that the developing trade
zone, extending from the Arctic Circle to Patagonia, is going to be one
of the dominant factors in the twenty-first century.
There are doubts over the future of the Pacific Rim economies, because
of the struggle for the succession in China. It is always possible that
China will disintegrate, with the rich provinces overwhelmed by the
hundreds of millions of peasants flooding in from the interior, but
Washington does not expect it.
The chances are that the next century will speak Chinese. The United
States, with its vast resources, its size, its colossal investment in
education and technology, will lead the world for as far as we can plan
but it will rely on its own hemisphere as an extended hinterland to
support its industries -- and will look west at Japan, China, and other
emerging Asian countries, not east at Europe.
Germany is the flavour of the week, indeed of the decade. But in the
long term, America's special relationship with Germany and with Europe
is due to slide into eclipse just as has its old alliance with Britain,
and for the same reason. The celebrated aphorism attributed to Lord
Palmerston (among others) that countries have no permanent friends, only
permanent interests, applies to the United States.
Its permanent interest in Europe is that the Russians not occupy the
place. The Germans and the rest can now see to that, with much reduced
American assistance, and Washington can concentrate on its greater
interest, which is its relations with Japan and China.
There is, however, a silver lining. Despite its drastically reduced
status in the world, Britain retains one huge advantage over Germany,
Japan, and all those other international powerhouses.
The natives speak English.
The British who arrive here, with a very few exceptions, drop
instantly into American society. There is a huge British fifth column in
America: there are said to be more than 250,000 in southern California
alone.
Other immigrants take a generation to assimilate. The British do it
instantaneously.
The converse applies: Americans, for the most part, do not speak
foreign languages and so pay much more attention to Britain and spend
more time there than anywhere else. They feel at home there (and the
British are much more welcoming to American visitors today than they
were a generation ago).
Mr Major is coming here next month. If he can rise to the occasion,
ignore the Adams snub, and perhaps even thank the President for his
efforts to nail Sinn Fein down to a permanent cease-fire, the latest
spat will be forgotten.
The special relationship of the Second World War is long over, and so
is the close philosophic alliance between the Reaganites and
Thatcherites. But Americans still like Britain best in Europe, and
British diplomacy still has a role to play. But forget all that Greece
and Rome stuff.
As they say here, that was then, this is now. The trick is to
recognise the new realities -- and get on with it.

<HEADLINE>Actress tells of friendship with twins</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979337426</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ACTRESS Barbara Windsor told of her shock yesterday at the death of
East End gangster Ronnie Kray and said the infamous twins should have
been released long ago.
She added that, if they had been judged by today's judicial standards,
they would have been free men by now and the streets of the East End had
been a lot safer when they were around.
The EastEnders actress was speaking after hearing of the death from a
heart attack of Ronnie Kray, 61. The Carry On star said: ''I've known
Ronnie and Reggie since I was 23.
''I was in a play called Fings Ain't What They Used To Be and Ronnie
came to see the show with his brothers, Reggie and Charlie.
''They came back stage after the show and we became friends.
''They weren't menacing and did a lot for charity. They were charming
with old people and toward women and they've been badly misrepresented
for over 30 years.
''People could walk the streets in the east end in those days. It was
a safer place.
''This must be so hard for Reggie especially being a twin. I hope they
let him go to the funeral.''
Asked if she would be attending the funeral, Miss Windsor said: ''I'll
probably send flowers. It's a day for the family otherwise it becomes a
circus.''
Mrs Kay Ferdinando, 58, landlady of the Blind Beggar pub in the heart
of the East End, said the death of Ronnie Kray was ''the end of an
era''. The Blind Beggar is the pub where the Krays committed their final
murder.

As three of the Beatles come together, David Belcher points a plectrum
towards a missing force
ALL you need is cred. Cred is all you need. So no, ex-Beatles, no . .
. don't do it! Don't delude yourselves, Paul and George and Ringo, that
the new songs you've been recording are Beatles' songs. They aren't.
Because you aren't the Beatles anymore.
You are no longer the Fab Four; you are the Threnodic Three, and if
you persist in self-delusion, it will all end in tears of woe and
disappointment. This ain't no magical mystery tour; it's shaping up to
be a tragical history flaw.
Paul McCartney broke the news earlier this week, in what has long been
established as his all-too-imitable gear-wacker-matey-Macca style, when
he revealed that the trio have worked together in a studio on new stuff
for the first time since January 4, 1970, when they united to finish off
Let It Be. The new tracks will be released at year's end to coincide
with a 10-hour TV documentary, The Beatles Anthology.
Quoth Paul, adopting his best I'm-a-perky-yet-lugubrious-Scouser-me
tones, and very probably sticking his ever-ready thumbs up at the same
time: ''George played some great guitar on this, we did some beautiful
harmonies, so much so that Ringo said 'It sounds like the bloody
Beatles'.''
No, lads! Yeah, yeah, yeah, we love you, but while what you've just
recorded might bloody sound like the Beatles, it bloody can't be the
Beatles . . . you can't be. Listen to me, fellows: don't get confused.
The chart-topping Yuletide success of Live At The BBC clearly shows that
music-lovers of all ages still want timeless Beatles' music from your
prime era -- but what we don't need is you old jossers trying, and
failing, to replicate the artistic flights of your own cheeky youth.
Please please me -- and, I suspect, rather a lot of music-lovers -- by
not doing it . . . by not releasing it. Time-lock your new tracks for
posterity! It's for your own good, honest. We want your reputation
preserved.
Chiefly, you can't bloody well be the Beatles because you no longer
have sarky, sentimental, bloody-minded Winston O'Boogie living on this
corporeal plane.
Sir John of Lennon: he's immortal because he's dead. Messrs McCartney,
Harrison and Starr: you are jowly and beardie, and you have a combined
span of 156 years -- and you are going to make yourselves appear daft
with claims to be the mopper-toppermost Beatles. And I'm not being
age-ist or look-ist when I say this.
No, no, no. You see, over the last five years, for the first time in
the past two decades, we've actually developed a fresh crop of new,
now-a-go-go Beatles-of-today, and they're really exciting to watch and
listen to, and a major part of the joy of pop is bound up with its
photogenic youthful energy, its sense of transience and change.
This current revival began with the La's in 1989 or so. Then we had
the Stone Roses for a spell, and now we've got Oasis, and the Boo
Radleys, and Ride, plus Crowded House, the Beautiful South and Dodgy, as
well as a slew of melodic Scottish beat combos whose roots lie in the
sixties: Del Amitri, Teenage Fanclub, Whiteout.
Admittedly, the Stone Roses have latterly become becalmed in oceans of
Led Zeppelin, and it must be said that Oasis's Liam Gallagher displays
too much of Ringo's droopiness to be a convincing heart-throb front-man
. . . but these bands are all good, and current, and happening.
So while in 1995 there's one musical camp quite happy to wail ''Let me
be your techno-techno ecstasee-fantasee, it's good for meeee'' over a
horrid synthesised blare at 143.8 beats per minute, there's also this
other tribe of young pop-classicists fretting and sweating over their
guitars; crafting songs which employ the old verse-chorus-verse routine;
who are forever looking for an inventive and joyous middle-eight. Leave
them to it, Paul and George and Ringo.
Not that I can expect you three to take much notice of what the papers
say. We've had 30 years of the British press getting the Beatles more
wrong than right.
What was it the Daily Telegraph said at the height of Beatlemania in
1963? It chuntered on blimpishly about mass hysteria, and empty heads
being filled with the same tricks of crowd manipulation that Adolf
Hitler used. But sadly, what the Daily Mirror then replied in support of
the Beatles was even worse.
In an editorial bearing the headline Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! the Mirror
tried in vain to be with-it and hep, grandaddio: ''You have to be a real
square not to love the nutty, noisy, happy, handsome Beatles. If they
don't sweep your blues away, brother, you're a lost cause. If they don't
put a beat in your feet, sister, you're not listening.''
After that, the press coverage got worse, brothers and sisters. More
patronising. Further off the beam. Later in the same year the New
Statesman identified ''the menace of Beatlism''. The menace of Beatlism?
Is Beatlism some offshoot of fascism? I don't think so. In fact, show me
a fascist stormtrooper and I'll show you someone who isn't wearing a
guitar and cuban-heeled winklepickers.
Meanwhile, the London Times was simultaneously gushing away about
''the Beatles' pandiatonic clusters and submediant time-switches'' and
the Sunday Times reckoned they were the greatest composers since
Beethoven, which is not a helpful or meaningful comparison.
Actually, it's only been in the years since the Beatles broke up that
we've been able to work out exactly what they were; measure what they
achieved; evaluate their true worth. Indeed, how's this for an apt
critical summary, from the most recent edition of Rolling Stone
magazine's Album Guide:
''The Beatles transformed rock'n'roll from a rebel yell and a lover's
whisper into the most comprehensive music of the twentieth century,
severing the line between high art and popular entertainment. The
rock'n'roll of the sixties was Beatles-spirited: celebratory, omniverous
in its appetite for diverse influence, politically expansive, and
spiritually open. Not liking the Beatles is as perverse as not liking
the sun.''
No argument from me about most of that, despite the fact that the
rock'n'roll of the sixties also evinced the black cynicism of the Velvet
Underground, and the mutant free-thinking of Captain Beefheart, and the
anger and nihilism of the MC5 and the Stooges . . . but I digress.
Let me end on a note as positive as Here Comes The Sun. If Paul and
George and Ringo truly want to re-form and make new music in 1995, let
them do it under another band-name. They could become the Quarrymen, or
the Beatals. OK, maybe those names are a bit too obvious . . . how about
becoming Johnny and the Moondogs, Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids,
Apollo C Vermouth and the Beat Brothers?
Whatever the name, let Paul and George and Ringo go out on the road,
unheralded by loud trumpetings of advance publicity. And let them
retrace their first steps in Scotland . . . it was 35 years ago in May,
the Silver Beetles went out to play on their first professional tour,
acting as Johnny Gentle's band on a two-week jaunt which kicked off at
Alloa Town Hall before visiting Forres, Fraserburgh, Inverness, Nairn,
and Peterhead.
Is there still a Dalrymple Hall in Fraserburgh, and if so, has it
become a venue for raves these days? Does Nairn still boast a Regal
Ballroom, or has it by turns been transformed into a bingo hall, then a
supermarket, and now a personal gymnasium and fitness centre?
Or they could play the five Scottish gigs they played in the winter of
1963, their first headlining tour as the Beatles -- and this time they
could play the one in Keith which was scuppered by snow drifts. They
could kick off in Elgin in an L-shaped hall then known as the Two Red
Shoes. For #42.
I'd go to see them. And Paul could do his famous thumbs-up gesture --
and then he could ram both his thumbs up my nostrils with a cry of:
''Stuff your cred nonsense, wack -- whatever band we're in, we're still
musicians!''
And I'd reply: Paul! George! Ringo! You should have let it be.

<HEADLINE>Scots underworld figures expected at former London gangster's funeral Crocodile tears for the 'mad, bad' Kray</HEADLINE>

FORMER associates of gangster Ronnie Kray, who died yesterday from a
heart attack, were last night planning the biggest funeral the East End
of London has ever seen. Previous gangland enemies were weeping
crocodile tears.
Scots underworld figures are likely to turn out in abundance at the
funeral of the 61-year-old killer, who with his twin brother Reggie
ruled the East of London in the late fifties and sixties through fear
and intimidation.
''He cut up more victims than most people did Sunday joints,'' was the
epitaph from John McVicar, at one time the most wanted armed robber in
the country.
At the height of their notoriety, the Krays loved to be seen with the
famous.
The relationship between Lord Boothby and Ronnie Kray caused great
concern for the Conservative Government of the day when it was made
known pictures of them together would be published.
Ronnie was the mad and baddest of the Kray twins. That says a lot.
Twin brother Reggie will be allowed out of prison to attend the
funeral, if he makes an application.
Yesterday, he was told of his twin's death and was taking it badly.
Fellow prisoners were offering him full support and the governor of his
Kent prison has offered counselling.
Former gangland enemies were last night singing Ronnie's praises. ''He
would never have stood for what is going on in the streets of his manor
now,'' they declared.
''In his day, nobody would have blagged a house in the home territory
and there was no such thing as mugging, certainly not of old women.
Drugs were never heard of.''
The late Arthur Thomson, one-time king of Glasgow's underworld, was a
close associate.
Long after the Kray twins were convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment with the recommendation they serve at least 30 years,
Arthur Thomson and his family were still doing business in the East End
of London. ''They are highly respected,'' I was often told.
Hardmen from Scotland were naturally attracted to the Krays. Reformed
killer Jimmy Boyle was one of those who knew them well.
Yesterday, ''Mad Frankie'' Fraser, one-time chief enforcer for the
Richardson gang -- the south of the river mob who were arch-rivals of
the Krays -- insisted last night he was absolutely devastated by the
announcement of Ronnie Kray's death.
''I can't speak highly enough of him,'' he said.
Personally, I saw the Kray twins face to face just once. That was at
the funeral of their mother, Violet, 13 years ago. The twins were
devoted to her and were most upset that the prison authorities had
attempted to make them look foolish at the funeral by manacling each of
them to the tallest prison officers that could be found.
Ronnie will be buried in the same cemetery.
The twins surrounded themselves with hardmen when they ruled their
crime empire. Unfortunately for them, one of them, John Dickson, a
one-time docker from Leith, was to turn Queen's evidence.
He had driven Ronnie to the Blind Beggar pub off the Mile End Road
when he set out for revenge against fellow gangster George Cornell who
had once too often spoken out about Ronnie's homosexuality. Taking
exception to being called a ''fat poof'', Ronnie walked up to him at the
bar and shot him between the eyes. He did not utter a word.
Ian Barrie, a Glaswegian, was with his boss Ronnie Kray at the time of
the slaying.
Two miles away in a basement flat across London, Reggie carried out an
even more chilling killing of another rival, Jack ''The Hat'' McVittie,
by stabbing him in the eye. Ronnie was present at that slaying.
These murders were to send the twins to prison for life.
Ronnie was transferred from Parkhurst top security jail on the Isle of
Wight to Broadmoor after psychiatrists had diagnosed he was suffering
from paranoid schizophrenia.
He had been taken from the top-security mental hospital at Broadmoor
to Heatherwood General Hospital at Ascot on Thursday after collapsing in
his ward. Initially, he was treated for anaemia and dizzy spells.
His condition worsened and he was transferred to Wexham Park Hospital,
Slough, where he died from a heart attack.
A post mortem examination conducted by Dr Mufeed Ali gave cause of
death as natural causes, police said last night.
Dr Ali said: ''The heart attack was due to smoking.''
There were reports that the former gangster smoked up to 140 roll-ups
a day.
''There was damage to his coronary arteries. He must have died
instantly but he must have been in some pain,'' said Dr Ali.
He added that Kray had refused to eat for a few days before his death.
''It could have been because he was in pain,'' he added.

IT is a minor perversion of mine, I know, much less salacious than
necrophilia certainly, but a bit weird for all that. Almost as long as I
can remember, ever since I first read about her in Doc MacPhail's
history class at Clydebank High, I've had this thing about Mary Queen of
Scots.
Surely there must be more than a few red-blooded, hairy-kneed Scots
males out there who've shared my fascination for this sexy, fateful
bewitcher.
Tall, enigmatic, with beautiful eyes, red hair, graceful, a hint of
the snooker shark . . . but let the history man Nigel Tranter summarise.
In his novel The Queen's Grace we learn that Mary was ''soft, gentle,
pliant -- yet somehow indomitable . . . true daughter of a hundred
kings, in whose eyes every man thought he saw the age-old plea to be
mastered''.
I began to realise, as I grew older and more cynical, that for Mary's
boyfriends and lovers all that beckoned was not a lifetime in the arms
of an angel but an early grave. Witness the sickly wee Dauphin Francis,
dead within months of his wedding; Henry Lord Darnley, blown up and
throttled in the Kirk o' Field assassination; Rizzio, the court
musician, ventilated by four dozen dagger-thrusts from an aristocratic
hit-squad; and Bothwell, dead in a lonely dungeon in Denmark. Fatal
attraction, forsooth.
Saddest of all the sad tales on this theme concerns a young, gallant,
and it has to be said, less than witty Frenchman called Chastelard,
Chatelar, Chatillon, Chasterlet, or Chatellet. Whichever version you
select the name spells out catastrophe.
Poor Chastelard. He first visited Scotland in the entourage of a
Monsieur Damville and returned later as a bearer of letters. He became a
favourite of Mary's, and seemed to have free access to her apartments,
to the disgust of the nobility. We're told that on occasion ''she
carried her graciousness so far'' as to recline upon her boyfriend's
shoulder and nibble his neck.
It's clear that Chas thought he was on a royal promise, and one night
went as far as hiding himself beneath Mary's bed, but was discovered and
dragged in an undignified manner from the chamber. The Queen's decision
to forgive him only made Chas more gallus and he repeated the ''below
bed'' strategy, this time in the unlikely setting of Burntisland in
Fife.
Nabbed once more, the Queen this time, somewhat surprisingly, is said
to have asked the Earl of Moray to dispatch the Frenchman without delay
and without giving him an opportunity for explanation or apology. This
only served to convince those who had witnessed the familiarity between
the two that some serious hanky-panky had indeed taken place.
MORAY persuaded the Queen to let the law take its course, and
Chastelard was convicted and sentenced to death after admitting
''iniquitous designs against the Queen's honour''. On the scaffold, the
Frenchman, romantic to the end, is recorded as having shouted to Mary:
''Adieu, most beautiful and cruel princess of the world''.
Now, did I ever tell you about my wee Joan of Arc fantasy?

EVERTON footballer Duncan Ferguson was yesterday banned for one year
and fined #500 for drink-driving.
The #4m Scottish international striker admitted driving with 106mg of
alcohol in his blood -- the legal limit is 80mg -- in Liverpool on
November 20 last year.
Ferguson, 23, was also ordered to pay #35 costs. Liverpool City
Magistrates gave him 28 days to pay.
Mr Andrew Gowar, prosecuting, said Ferguson had been stopped outside
the Moat House Hotel in the city's Paradise Street, where he has been
staying since his move from Rangers last year.
A police officer had seen him drive through no-entry signs in the bus
station at speed, said Mr Gowar.
He said the officer pointed out Ferguson's careless driving, noticed
that his breath smelled of alcohol, and asked if he had been drinking.
Ferguson gave a positive roadside breath-test and was taken to a
police station, where he gave two breath samples and then a blood
sample.
Mr Kevin Douglas, defending, said Ferguson had, ''made a
straightforward error in relation to driving through Paradise Street bus
station''. He denied speeding.
Mr Douglas asked the magistrates to reflect the relatively low alcohol
reading in any financial penalty.
''He is obviously very sorry for what has happened. He has realised
the error that he has made and asks that you deal with him as leniently
as possible.''
Ferguson begins a four-match ban today after the second sending-off of
his brief Everton career -- a ban that will see him miss next month's FA
Cup semi-final between Everton and Tottenham Hotspur at Elland Road,
Leeds.
He is due to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on an assault charge in
May and has a 12-match Scottish FA ban hanging over him from an alleged
head-butting incident involving a Raith Rovers player.

SENIOR executives of Scottish companies which went bust between 1986
and 1994 are in line for a multi-million pound payout under a House of
Lords decision which could open the floodgates on ''a fatcats'
charter'', according to financial sources.
Most of Scotland's 200 chartered accountacy firms which specialise in
insolvency now face potential legal action from managers of firms which
went to the wall during an eight-year window in the law over
compensation payments.
Five Law Lords decided on Thursday that employees kept on by a company
in receivership, where there was a prospect of that company's eventual
survival, were entitled to contractual benefits during the period of the
receiver's or administrator's term of office.
The deal does not apply to the vast majority of shop-floor workers,
who were paid under the terms of existing redundancy legislation and
have no further claim.
But it does apply to higher-paid staff and to executives who had set
themselves up with severance deals beyond the basic state compensation
package.
It also means that those involved have a claim on the company's
remaining assets which supercedes all other creditors, and even the fees
of the receiver.
Mr Douglas Laing, a member of the technical committee of the UK
Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, and a leading Scottish
accountant, said last night: ''We are about to see years of immense
litigation.
''Many companies which went belly-up during the eight years in
question were multi-national. Leyland-Daf, involved in the Albion axle
plant in Glasgow, is Dutch-owned. We could see court cases in Holland
over that one.
''There is no way to separate Scottish figures from the rest of the
UK. But it probably amounts to several hundreds of millions of pounds.
It is a wait-and-see situation at the moment.
''The most galling part of the decision is that it will benefit the
basic workforce of bankrupt companies not one whit. It is the senior
staff and those with cast-iron, self-interest contracts who will have a
claim for payment.
''The big question now is what the banks and the Government intend to
do about it. Most receivers have already paid what they thought were
their dues and the residue to banks.
''This will generate court cases for years to come and will be fought
every inch of the way.''

Further legislation may be needed to help Strathclyde Police curb the
number of firearms available to criminals
WITH the enormous spread of column inches and air time of the past two
days it might be possible for a stranger to think that Strathclyde has
become a gun-ridden landscape where crossing the street is a dangerous
exercise.
Reality, of course, seldom matches tabloid headlines. No Paisley
police officer actually said his men were armed and would gun-down the
drug dealers in the street. Teams of armed police were not drafted into
Paisley, Linwood, Barrhead, Renfrew and Johnstone.
Chief Constable Leslie Sharp's detectives do not say to criminals that
they will buy their guns -- although Mr Sharp was probably to blame to a
large extent for giving a misleading impression by his use of a
throwaway soundbite.
Detective Chief Superintendent John Fleming wisely puts that red
herring into perspective: ''We have been known occasionally in the past
to pay for information which has led to the recovery of a gun. That is
different from the concept of paying a criminal for a gun.
''This all dates from the start of Operation Spur in January 1992 when
we recognised that sometimes the only way to get our hands on a
dangerous weapon so that it can be removed from the street was to pay
the informant,'' he says.
The informant, the ''tout'' of police argot, is a regular, often
vital, source of intelligence. This background information, now
computerised and codified, has assumed a far greater importance in
Scottish police operations -- possibly dating from the period in office
of the former Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Colin Sampson, who
preached the doctrine of intelligence relentlessly.
''It may be,'' says Chief Superintendent Fleming, ''that the informant
knows where there is a gun that has been used in a crime. It may be that
the only feasible way we can get to that gun is to persuade him to buy
it. He would have to be a trusted informant before we would do that. If
it is successful we would then reimburse him for what he laid out.''
There would appear to be little controversy in using that means of
removing a weapon from criminal hands. ''Tout money'' has been part of
policing since its beginnings.
John Fleming and others point out that murder by firearm is, in fact,
a rare occurrence in Scotland.
Of the 72 killings in Strathclyde last year, an average year, he says
he could count the number in which guns were used on one hand. Crime
being a cussed animal, he said that to The Herald yesterday against the
background of a Paisley man shot down on his doorstep on Tuesday evening
and two brothers shot, one fatally, outside an Orange hall in Maryhill
on Thursday night.
What does exercise senior officers such as Fleming and Sharp is the
knowledge that, having taken a total of 3400 ''criminal'' weapons out of
the streets and housing schemes since 1992, Strathclyde is still, to use
Sharp's phrase, awash with guns. The total retrieved includes 532
pistols, 272 rifles, 1077 shotguns, 783 air weapons and 735 imitation or
replica weapons.
Many of the guns, particularly the shotguns, still find their way on
to the criminal market after housebreakings, despite the successive
constraints on possession in recent years.
The simple way to stop that trade would be to outlaw the possession of
any weapon -- sporting shotgun or sporting target rifle or pistol. The
''sporting'' lobby in this country, though, is immensely strong, as
powerful as the gun lobby in America, so any attempt at legislation
would be bound to fail.
Another common source is EU countries. They have been flooded with
illegal weapons since the breakup of the Eastern bloc.
It is possible take a Channel ferry, drive to any French town, and, on
the production of elementary identification, buy a lethal weapon such as
a .22 pistol, deadly at short range.
The UK's ring-fence of Customs and Immigration staff is meanwhile
being dismantled, with the Government hacking away at numbers to save
more cash, with little apparent thought for the obvious consequences in
weapons and drugs. In countries such as Spain and Italy controls on guns
are derisory. Smuggling a dismantled weapon into the UK becomes less of
a problem daily.
''After removing that many guns in three years you might think there
would be a shortage out there,'' remarks Fleming. The tripling in price
to the criminal for gun hire appears to indicate that. Yet when one gun
is seized another seems immediately to take its place. The reality is
that our society has tolerated guns for so long that there is a
limitless supply from many sources.
The police have some successes; reducing armed robbery by 50% in
Strathclyde is largely down to their campaigning to have obvious targets
such as banks, building societies and post offices toughen up their
security.
The police service itself does not want more guns but Sharp's case for
having Strathclyde Police brought up to the staffing establishment
required for 1995 as opposed to the 1975 level at which it stands seems
irrefutable.
The equation is simple -- more police for targeting, surveillance and
special operations works in terms of reduced overall crime. Gun and drug
crime seems harder to crack but less handwringing and more action from
politicians would help.

<HEADLINE>Pensioner survives 600ft fall unscathed</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979337433</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PENSIONER last night said he thought he was about to die as he fell
600ft down Ben Wyvis. He survived without a scratch and climbed the
mountain in treacherous conditions to find his companion.
Mr Brian Holland, 65, was safely back in his hotel while rescuers were
still searching for him in white-out conditions.
Mr Holland was climbing with a female companion, Ms Anne Briggs, of
Nottingham, on a ridge close to the 3433ft summit when he fell through a
snow cornice into Coire Na Feola.
The accident happened shortly after 1pm on Thursday when there was a
high avalanche risk. Visibility was so poor that Mr Holland was probing
his way with a pole without realising he was on an unstable cornice.
When it gave way, he tumbled down the mountain but his fall was
cushioned by soft snow.
Ms Briggs was able to get off the mountain to raise the alarm.
Dundonnel mountain rescue team and an RAF helicopter went to the scene
as rescuers from RAF Kinloss and dog handlers stood by.
Mr Holland, of Lambley, Nottinghamshire, later walked off the hill
unaided and unhurt at 5.25pm. He had scrambled his way back on to the
ridge and followed the track down.
He later stunned regulars at the Inchbrae Hotel in Wester Ross, where
he was staying, when he told them of his ordeal.
A hotel spokeswoman said: ''I asked him how he was feeling and he
said: 'Not bad for someone who has just fallen down Ben Wyvis'. We
couldn't believe it. There wasn't a mark on him. He was very lucky
indeed.''
Mr Mike Brown, deputy leader of Dundonnel mountain rescue team, said
he and a colleague were dropped on to the mountain by helicopter around
3pm to begin a search for Mr Holland and were later joined by other team
members.
''The conditions were absolutely foul -- the worst I have ever seen.
It was a total white-out and we could hardly see because of the
blizzards. When we started shouting to try to locate the man, we
triggered two avalanches.''
He said they later learned Mr Holland had turned up but a further
deterioration in the weather meant the helicopter could no longer get
close enough to pick up the rescue team. They eventually walked off
around 10.15pm.
Mr Brown added: ''We cannot condemn the man at all. He was very lucky
indeed to escape unhurt and then he and his companion did everything
right.''
Mr Holland, an experienced climber, said he said he and Ms Briggs had
been discussing possible danger areas on the snow-covered ridge near the
summit when the cornice gave way.
''It started off quite slowly but then I accelerated and then I just
took off into a free fall. I couldn't see anything and I remember
thinking 'This is it. I'm going to die'.'' When he stopped he was able
to pick himself up and began the ''frightening'' ascent again -- not
knowing where his companion was.

COMIC Relief volunteers fooled around in earnest on Red Nose Day
yesterday and topped the target of #100m in charity donations.
With #92m already raised from four previous Red Nose Days, the
organisers collected a further #10,483,398, to meet their target.
The day's highlight was a comedy extravaganza on BBC1, Night of Comic
Relief, which included an all-star stable of animal impersonators in a
version of Old MacDonald -- written by Phil Collins -- featuring
Archbishop Desmond Tutu as a sheep, Emma Thompson as a pig, Whoopi
Goldberg as a chicken, and Hugh Grant as a cat.
Thousands of BT employees and other volunteers manned nearly 3000
phone lines for people to pledge money.
Two-thirds of the cash raised from the biennial event will go to
Africa, while the rest will stay in the UK for projects to support
homeless and disabled young people and those with drug and alcohol
problems.
Among local events, RAF Kinloss held a Romans v Christians football
match.

<TEXT>
FORMER Cabinet Minister David Mellor last night easily beat off a bid
to oust him from his parliamentary seat.
By a margin of 200 to five, members of the Putney Conservative
Association in south-west London voted against a motion calling for a
new candidate for the next eletion.
But the former heritage secretary's victory had a bitter after-taste,
with accusations of dirty tricks, personal slurs and threats to expel
his opponents.
Emerging triumphantly from the meeting Mr Mellor, referring to local
Tory Donald MaKenzie, who had tabled the motion demanding his
resignation, said: ''Mr MacKenzie has revealed himself to be the Herbie
Hide of Putney politics -- just another horizontal heavyweight.''
Mr Mellor, 46, found himself challenged because of his high profile
extra-marital affairs with actress Antonia de Sancha and Lady Cobham, as
well as allegations of poor attendance at the Commons and excessive
outside business interests.
Mr Garret Smyth, who had also opposed Mr Mellor, alleged dirty tricks
were used to secure the vote in Mr Mellor's favour, including a failed
attempt to pass a motion expelling those who opposed him.

THE French Presidential election campaign has been enlivened by saucy
slander and serious considerations on Europe.
In France, where extra-marital affairs tend to enhance reputations
more than damage them, politicians, they say, may get away with
anything, except being found in bed with a dead woman or a live man.
The gossip going the rounds in Paris last week was that Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur, married and a father of four, has been pursuing an
intimate relationship with his male chief of cabinet, Nicolas Bazire,
38.
The latter, who before entering politics was drummed out of the navy
for something called ''ineptitude to command'', is not surprisingly
terribly upset. Doubtless put about by the friends of Jacques Chirac, Mr
Balladur's rival, the story has to be malicious fantasy, however
amusing, and even if Mr Balladur does resemble a Church of England
bishop.
Thanks to privacy laws, only the extreme right-wing paper Minute has
dared publish the rumour. No wonder Mr Balladur, who pointedly mentions
General de Gaulle whenever he meets Gaullist MPs, last week repeated:
''Election campaigns are not fought with stink bombs.''
The cream of the Gaullist establishment, meanwhile, met in a Paris
hotel on Thursday to hear Mr Chirac, the man the polls predict is most
likely to win the presidential election, outline his foreign policy. It
was the second big policy speech of his campaign and a long-awaited one.
Diplomatic staff, including British Ambassador Sir Christopher Mallaby,
were there.
It was a most professionally staged and brilliantly acted meeting: for
nearly 90 minutes Mr Chirac did not read his script so much as perform
it, investing every word with carefully calculated emotional effect.
Like John Major, Mr Chirac has been plagued by Euro-sceptics on the
right wing of his party, the Gaullist RPR, and political opportunism has
caused his position on Europe to waver over recent years. One of his
main supporters in this election, for example, Philippe Seguin, was a
leading campaigner for a no vote in the referendum of September 1992 on
the Maastricht Treaty.
Last week, Mr Chirac emerged as firmly pro-European. He called for a
larger, stronger and more efficiently run European Union, one that would
remain based on the ''backbone'' of the Franco-German relationship. To
reassure Euro-sceptics and tickle the patriot fibre of the Gaullists, Mr
Chirac expressed his own nationalistic sentiments and made reverent
references to the heritage and the memory of General de Gaulle.
It was necessary, he said, ''to reconcile the French with one another
on Europe and reconcile the French with Europe''. Without saying when
such expansion would be practical, Mr Chirac went on to argue that the
construction of Europe must extend to the former Eastern bloc countries,
which had been ''kidnapped'' by Soviet communism.
''It is a moral and political duty . . . and an essential condition
for peace on our continent,'' he said.
Greater harmonisation of national policies within Europe was
necessary, Mr Chirac said, but security and foreign policy as laid out
in the Treaty of Maastricht had proved to be patently insufficient.
Worse, the treaty which had only been ''a small step in the right
direction'', had merely worsened the divorce between ''technocratic
Europe'' and its peoples.
Mr Chirac insisted heavily on the future importance of the
Franco-German relationship which must, he said, ''form the backbone of
future economic and monetary union''.
His priorities with Chancellor Kohl of Germany would be to establish a
Franco-German policy for the inter-governmental conference of 1996. To
enhance the efficiency of the Eurpean Union, Mr Chirac also proposed to
reinforce the role of the Council of Ministers and the institution of a
President, who would be designated for three years by the European
Council.
Europe is strongly supported by the two other leading candidates in
the presidential election, Mr Balladur and the socialist Lionel Jospin,
and little separates Mr Chirac's policy from Mr Balladur's.
Last week, however, Mr Chirac pulled off a particularly fine
performance and slipped in the sort of fine words that charm an
electorate, such as the concluding line of his speech: ''By basing our
foreign policy on our values, we do not claim they are the best, but
that policy is based on the best of what we are.''

MURRAY RITCHIE, European Editor, Brussels
CANADA continued its tough stand in the halibut war with the European
Union yesterday when its chief negotiators in the dispute over the
Spanish freezer ship, Estai, abruptly returned to Ottawa from Brussels.
Mr Jacques Roy, Canada's ambassador to the EU, said the team had left
for ''essential'' consultations. EU officials were angered at Mr Roy's
announcement that the Canadians wanted a postponement of peace talks
scheduled for later this month in Brussels. An EU official said later he
understood the talks had been cancelled and no fresh date set.
Mrs Emma Bonino, European fisheries Commissioner, announced on
Wednesday that the talks would take place because Canada had released
the Estai on bail after its arrest off Newfoundland.
However EU officials continued to deny suggestions that the Estai
affair was now a matter of conservation and not just the legality of the
Canadian authorities' action in firing over the bows of the ship before
seizing her in international waters.
The Canadians have since claimed the boat was in breach of
international law by using nets -- which it abandoned when challenged --
with too small a mesh, catching undersized fish, and keeping a double
log book to mislead authorities about the size of the haul.
A European Commission spokesman described the Canadian's latest
position as unacceptable because the issues raised by the Estai's arrest
should be dealt with by all members of the North Atlantic Fisheries
Organisation (Nafo).
''It doesn't give us much hope for a solution in the future,'' the
spokesman said.
However Mr Roy promised that telephone contact would be maintained
from Ottawa and that Commission and Canadian experts would continue work
on control and conservation measures. He said significant progress on
conservation issues had been made.
The Canadians have also angered the EU by refusing to rule out the
seizure of another Spanish boat if they consider it to be breaking
Canada's unilaterally-imposed law beyond the 200-mile limit.

Manila, Friday
THE prayers of thousands of people turned to rage and grief today
after Singapore hanged a Filipina mother of four despite desperate
Philippine appeals for a stay of execution.
Flor Contemplacion, a 42-year-old maid, died on the gallows in Changi
Prison for a double murder many Filipinos are convinced she did not
commit.
''They should kill all the Singaporeans here,'' said Antonio Caangay,
one of a group of 50 keeping vigil early today outside the Singapore
Embassy.
Caangay, a security guard, said Singapore had ignored the Philippines'
pleas for a stay and had ''belittled our country''.
A group of mainly elderly women from Contemplacion's home town of San
Pablo in Laguna province south of Manila wept and covered their faces
with towels when they heard of her death.
''I am very very sad. We leave her fate in God's hands,'' said Delia
Contemplacion, a relative who waited with the San Pablo group at the
embassy. ''I am very mad at Singapore but anger won't cure anything,
justice will.''
Singapore went ahead with the execution after saying it had
investigated purported new evidence claiming Contemplacion had beeen
framed and found it untrue.
Contemplacion was convicted of strangling another Filipina maid and
the three-year-old son of the victim's employers.
Much of the anger was directed at the Manila government. A communist
death squad has threatened to retaliate against Singaporeans, and also
against Philippine government officials, who, it claims, did not do
enough to help Contemplacion.
''There will be no end to it protest-wise for those who have been
traumatised by Flor's death because of their belief that Flor was
innocent,'' said her lawyer, Jose Grapilon.
''It will really strike chords. Chords of disgust, chords of
self-pity, feelings of helplessness,'' said Grapilon, national
secretary-executive director of the Philippines' bar association.
Poverty at home forces two million Filipinos to work overseas, often
at menial tasks. Teachers work as maids in Hong Kong or Singapore,
engineers work as labourers in Middle East oil fields, secretaries work
as ''entertainers'' in Japan.
Reports of abuse such as rape or beatings by employers or harassment
by authorities are commonplace.
The #6000m they send home each year is the Philippines' second biggest
source of foreign-exchange revenue after exports.
''We grieve for the demise of Flor Contemplacion,'' said a statement
from the office of President Fidel Ramos. ''Her tragic death now demands
that we strengthen efforts to further protect the rights of overseas
contract workers.''
The head of a national left-wing women's group vowed that protesters
would disrupt the scheduled official visit to Manila next month of
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.
''We are going to hound him. He will be sorry he ever came here,''
Liza Masa of the Gabriela group told reporters.
Police said 2000 people had been outside the embassy last night, some
singing and others praying.
Prayers for Contemplacion were said on national television in the
overwhelmingly Christian Philippines.--Reuter.

Baku, Friday
TROOPS in Azerbaijan today crushed a coup staged by rebel police whose
aim was to seize and assassinate President Haydar Aliyev.
Up to 80 people, as well as civilians, were believed to have died when
Azeri Government troops stormed the headquarters of the Opon special
police, Russian independent television reported.
Mutiny leader Rovshan Javadov, the country's Deputy Interior Minister,
was killed in fierce fighting after troops attacked a base where
hundreds of rebel police were holed up.
Aliyev, 71, a former Soviet Politburo member, said: ''There are
numerous casualties on both sides.''
National Security Minister Namig Abbasov told a Cabinet meeting that
the plotters ''planned to seize the president and kill him''.
The violence, the second bout of serious political unrest in six
months, underscored the country's chronic instability.
Abbasov hinted at a crackdown on the main opposition groups by
accusing the Popular Front and the religious Hazzavat party of
supporting the rebellion.
''We will not allow these crimes to continue. We will arrest those
people who are still against the republic,'' said Interior Minister
Ramil Usubov.
Aliyev himself came to power after an uprising in June 1993 which
forced elected Popular Front President Abulfaz Elcibei to flee.
Aliyev is trying to bring stability to the country, which has been on
the losing end of a war with Armenians in its Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Defence Minister Safar Abiyev said government soldiers attacked the
headquarters of the rebel police unit just outside the capital Baku
after they tried to break out during the night to capture the
presidential palace.
Last October Aliyev declared a state of emergency after the same
special police unit held Azerbaijan's prosecutor-general hostage for
several hours.--Reuter.

Madrid, Friday
CLOUD hanging over today's Spanish royal wedding in Seville was lifted
yesterday when hotel workers in the southern city called off a
threatened strike.
Hotel staffs had planned to leave thousands without services in the
city for the marriage of the Infanta Elena, the eldest daughter of King
Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, to aristocrat Jaime de Marichalar y Saenz
de Tejada.
Yesterday, however, union leaders said they had agreed to go to
arbitration and cancelled the walkout.
Some 1300 official guests, including the Prince of Wales, are due in
Seville along with more than 2000 journalists, a 4000-strong police task
force, and thousands of well-wishers and tourists for Spain's first
royal wedding in 89 years.
The princess, a spontaneous and outgoing 31-year-old with a degree in
education, is second in line to the Spanish throne after her brother,
Crown Prince Felipe. The bridegroom is 32.
The couple met in Paris where he works for a private finance house.
For the government, as for millions of Spaniards, the royal wedding
comes as a welcome relief from the problems of a devalued peseta, a fish
war with Canada, and corruption scandals which have dominated the news
in recent months.

Los Angeles, Friday
A BOMB squad today detonated a device that looked like a pipe bomb and
was found in the court building where football legend O J Simpson is
being tried on double-murder charges.
Police said planting of the device may have been related to St
Patrick's Day. A note attached to it started ''Fenians arise'' and read
in part, ''We, the Fenians, find the current situation intolerable . . .
''
Also the Irish Prime Minister John Bruton was meeting President
Clinton in Washington today, and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was
invited to a White House reception.
Police and sheriff's deputies closed the streets and sidewalks around
the Los Angeles Criminal Courts building and shut down the main entrance
for more than an hour before blowing up the device.
The bomb scare delayed the start of today's hearing, in which a
railway worker was dismissed from the jury. Authorities suspected he was
writing a book about the trial after a laptop computer was found in his
hotel room.
He became the fifth panellist ousted from the sequestered jury.
The judge's decision reduced the ranks of alternate jurors to only
seven, with the trial expected to last at least four or five months
more. Some legal analysts are concerned that a mistrial could result if
fewer than 12 people are left sitting on the regular panel.--Reuter/AP

NEW YORK: A 38-year-old New Yorker has been named the city's
unluckiest man. Lawrence Hanratty's wife ran off with her lawyer, and
three lawyers fighting for his disability claim from a 1984 building
site accident that put him in a coma for weeks either died or were
disbarred. His car was written off in a crash last year and he takes 42
pills a day for heart and liver disease. He is depressed and suffers
from agoraphobia, but his landlord has threatened to kick him out.
However he is not giving up yet: ''There's always hope,'' he told the

Sarajevo, Friday
A SENIOR British special forces commander and three Special Air
Service officers surrendered their vehicle to four Serb hijackers near
Sarajevo without putting up a fight, UN sources said today.
The incident last week was one in a series plaguing the United Nations
in recent weeks as separatist Serbs have hijacked vehicles travelling
the main road between Sarajevo and Kiseljak, 18 miles to the west.
''The car was stopped by four armed Serbs in Ilidza and the British
officers had only a single weapon among them so they handed the vehicle
over,'' said a UN source. The four Serbs carried Kalashnikov assault
rifles.
''The SAS chaps had to make a snap judgment whether to resist. We
think they did the right thing. They're not here as combatants. No-one
was hurt and the vehicle was eventually returned,'' the source said.
British troops, including members of the elite SAS, make up the
second-largest UN peacekeeping contingent in Bosnia.
A UN vehicle carrying three passengers was hijacked yesterday near a
Serb checkpoint on the road. Another UN vehicle was taken the day
before.
UN sources say Serbs have grabbed half-a-dozen vehicles at gunpoint in
recent weeks.
''The level of banditry in that area is becoming an issue of serious
concern for Unprofor (the UN Protection Force),'' UN spokesman Alex
Ivanko said.
Ivanko indicated the UN was considering anti-hijacking patrols along
the route.
In another example of harassment of peacekeepers today, two United
Nations planes were hit by gunfire while landing at Sarajevo airport,
throwing the future of Bosnia's humanitarian airlift into grave doubt.
A cargo plane was hit by two rounds and a passenger plane by a single
round while landing a few minutes later, said Ivanko.
''The planes were hit by heavy machine-gun rounds or by a 20mm
anti-aircraft canon. We are investigating the incident and the firing
point has not yet been determined.''
Humanitarian aid flights into Sarajevo had been suspended all week
after a Red Cross plane was hit by gunfire last Saturday. A plane
carrying UN envoy Yasushi Akashi was holed the next day.
''Today's incidents at the Sarajevo airport are very worrying with
regard to the future of the humanitarian airlift,'' said Michael
Williams, Akashi's spokesman.
''A committee met in Geneva on the airlift on Wednesday and decided it
was not yet safe to resume flights. Today's attacks can only make
matters worse.''--Reuter.

Kuwait, Monday
TWO Americans working in Kuwait have been held since Monday by Iraqi
police after they crossed the border on their way to visit friends, UN
officials said today.
At the White House, press secretary Mike McCurry said President
Clinton had been briefed on the situation and the United States was
''doing what we should be doing'' to win the men's release.
The Americans, who were not identified, drove to the UN observer
mission, based in the border town of Umm Qasr, and were turned away
because they lacked permission to be there, said Salim Fahmawi,
spokesman for the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission.
They were heading back to Kuwait when they were arrested by Iraqi
police on Monday night, Fahmawi said.
A UN diplomat in New York said the Americans were trying to visit
friends in a Danish engineering unit housed near Umm Qasr. They were
driving a white jeep similar to those used by the United Nations, and
were about 25yd inside Iraq when they were seized, the diplomat said.
Since the United States has no diplomatic relations with Iraq,
Washington has asked the United Nations and Poland, which handles US
interests in Baghdad, to investigate.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it was negotiating
with the Iraqi Government for access to the men.
The head of the UN force in Kuwait, Major General Krishna Thapa,
visited Baghdad on Tuesday to ask about the Americans, said the UN
official in New York. The Iraqis neither confirmed nor denied knowledge
of the arrests.
Today the United Nations had received no response to Thapa's demand
for the release of the Americans and guarantees of their safety, the
diplomat said.
Fahmawi said the two had driven across the protective trench dug by
the Kuwaitis along the 130-mile border near Umm Qasr, Iraq's only port
on the Persian Gulf.
UN officials have been in contact with Iraqi authorities ''to
determine the Americans' whereabouts and to ensure their safety'', said
Fahwami. He did not say what response there had been from the Iraqis.
The state-run Iraqi media has not reported the men's arrest at the
border, which Baghdad recognised on November 10 under UN pressure.
Nor has there been any official word from the Baghdad regime, which
has bitterly criticised Washington recently for pressing the UN Security
Council to maintain the crippling trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after
it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
The situation in Iraq has been described by US officials as
unstable.--AP/Reuter.

FORMER Scottish executive member of the board of British Rail, Mr John
Cameron, is involved in the Stagecoach bus company's bid to run train
services.
This emerged yesterday as the deadline for companies expressing
interest in the first eight of the rail services to be offered to the
private sector was reached. It was the first opportunity the Government
had to gauge the reaction of the private sector to running train
services.
The eight franchises, which companies were invited to pre-qualify for,
included operations run by ScotRail and InterCity East Coast. It is
understood that management-led teams from both operations are among the
initial bidders. Management-led bids are also expected from the other
six rail operations.
Perth-based Stagecoach is one of several private concerns said to be
interested in all eight franchises, although it has gone on record as
saying its preference would be for the ScotRail and South West Trains
operations.
Other parties interested in all eight franchises are thought to
include London &amp; Continental, which includes Richard Branson's Virgin
Group and National Express, the West country-based Badgerline group (the
UK's second biggest private coach operator), and French water company
Generale des Eaux.
Mr Cameron, 55, spent two terms on the board of BR before stepping
down in September, 1993. He was instrumental in luring Mr Chris Green
north to lead ScotRail's shadow running as an independent entity before
privatisation. Mr Green resigned as ScotRail director last month.
Mr Cameron had broadly hinted that he may join Mr Green in a proposed
Scottish Railway Company, before he gave up his ScotRail and BR posts.
Mr Brian Cox, director of Stagecoach, the UK's biggest private coach
operator with a turnover of #400m, said Mr Cameron had been advising the
company for a short period.
''He is simply adding his railway expertise to our existing business
and bus expertise,'' Mr Cox said.
The bus chief added: ''We would be looking to provide increased
efficiency and use the results of that to provide a better service.''
Other franchises include Gatwick Express, Great Western, London
Tilbury and Southend (LTS Rail), Midland Main Line, Network
SouthCentral, and South West Trains.
At this stage, interested parties have been asked merely to register
with the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf). Invitations to
tender are expected to be issued by the end of next month. Franchising
director Roger Salmon is expected to announce the successful bidders by
the end of the year.
Those opposed to privatisation may have to wait some time to see the
extent of the interest.
An Opraf spokesman yesterday declared that the response had been
''very pleasing''. He said details would not be released until next
Wednesday, by which time the serious bids would have been sorted out.
Even then, hoever, only the number of applications and the quality of
bids received would be made known, not the names of those who had
applied.
He said: ''We will not be naming who the bidders are during the
franchising process, although some have already chosen to go public.''

CONSERVATIVE MP Teresa Gorman yesterday accepted substantial
undisclosed libel damages over an article which claimed she had made
almost #1m profit out of the sale of council houses to Tories by
Westminster Council.
Mrs Gorman and her husband, Jim, were at the High Court to hear her
solicitor Ms Charlotte Watson, tell Mr Justice Morison that the Daily
Mirror story in January 1994 was highly damaging to her professional and
personal reputation.
She said the newspaper claimed that the 63-year-old MP for Billericay
had been guilty of shameful misconduct.
It also suggested Mrs Gorman took improper advantage of her public
position as a councillor by persuading the council to sell her the
freehold of council houses within weeks of her election.
Ms Watson said that the Gormans bought one house in Lord North Street,
Westminster, from a private individual at full market value 20 years
ago.
Over the next few years the couple spent a great deal of effort on
renovation as the house was virtually uninhabitable.
The council later agreed to extend the lease and the Gormans
eventually bought the freehold of the property, which was unsuitable and
uneconomic for council housing.
The purchase of the property had nothing to do with the ''right to
buy'' policy introduced by Westminster City Council in 1985 and bore no
comparison with the allegations of misuse of council funds made by the
district auditor.
Ms Watson said it was also false to allege that Mrs Gorman's political
position was connected to the sale to her of the freehold. Many
freeholds in the area were sold at that time to leaseholders.
Publishers MGN Ltd had agreed to pay Mrs Gorman damages and her legal
costs.
Afterwards, Mrs Gorman said the time had come for the law to require
newspapers to give as much space to an apology as to the original
allegations.
''That would put newspapers in the stocks and expose them to the sort
of public ridicule they inflict on other people.''
She said the Mirror had not apologised for the story and this
reflected badly on journalism in general.
''If, at the end of the day, it means that legislation has to come
about to restrain the press, they will have brought it upon
themselves.''
She would not say how much damages she had been granted.

THE death of his war hero grandfather has placed a heavy
responsibility on the shoulders of 18-year-old Harrow pupil Simon
Fraser.
Simon, grandson of Lord Lovat, is due to inherit one of Scotland's
most famous titles in three years when he comes of age but faces losing
his family's 600-year-old estate.
His father, also Simon, died of a heart attack last March during a
hunt. Andrew, third son of the late Lord Lovat, died the same month on
safari.
The schoolboy will inherit an estate beset by financial problems. It
is thought the only way the debts can be paid off is by selling the
estate.
Beaufort Castle has been valued at more than #1m and the estate a
further #9m. Some of the fishing rights have already been sold.
Lord Lovat's funeral is on Tuesday. The requiem mass will be held at
noon in St Mary's church in Eskadale, near Beauly, Inverness-shire.
The cortege will be preceded by a lone piper from the church to the
private burial ground of the Clan Fraser nearby.
Bishop Mario Conti, of Aberdeen, who knew Lord Lovat well in his final
years, will preside over the service, accompanied by Father Austin
Gaskell, the local priest who attended the peer in his last days and
comforted his family when he died.
A memorial service will be held in London later this year.

EXCLUSIVE
A COUNCIL owned company, which was set up with public money, has a
#170,000 provision in its accounts to enable it to pay-off its chief
executive if he is sacked or does not have his contract renewed in two
years.
The Herald can reveal the ''termination provision'' clause is included
in the notes to accounts of Edinburgh Development and Investment
Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Edinburgh District Council.
The clause deals with Mr William Ross, the district council's former
director of economic development and estates, who left to become the
full-time chief executive of EDI, a council company set up to create new
investment in the city, in April 1992.
The last company records lodged, for up to the end of 1993, showed he
has a pay package worth at least #85,000 a year. Details of the clause
came in that year's financial records which showed the company made a
loss of #233,197.
Setting up the termination provision, including the relevant taxation,
is costing #249,870.
New company records due to be announced within the next month will
show the company has been turned around and has made its biggest profit,
believed to be more than #1.5m.
However, despite the expected turnaround, the pay-off clause has been
criticised by a leading Conservative councillor.
Mr Ian Hoy, Tory group leader, said: ''This seems excessive to me.
There is a public interest here and we have to be particularly careful
when dealing with public money.
''We know the kind of press private industry has had for paying its
chief executives large amounts of money, something I find unacceptable.
''I'm not sure if local tax-payers are going to be particularly
enamoured to find one man being given such a large amount of money if
his contract isn't renewed, or if he is sacked.''
Edinburgh Development and Investment Limited is a group of companies
set up to help create new investment in the city and help the capital
compete with other European cities in the field of economic development.
District council chiefs confirmed the figures in the company accounts
and said it was likely Mr Ross would get around twice his final salary
if either his contract was terminated early or it was not renewed in two
years.
Based on Mr Ross's 1993 salary, that would mean he would have been
offered a package of around #170,000 if he left when the accounts were
lodged. The district council paid its former chief executive, Mr Paul
Lowenberg, around #140,00 when he was sacked last year.
A district council spokesman confirmed that the board of the company
had agreed the package for Mr Ross included in the company report.
In his support, Councillor Lesley Hinds, leader of Edinburgh District
Council, said: ''Mr Ross is doing a magnificent job for Edinburgh. He
has built up the company to the point where it is involved in such major
developments as New Edinburgh, Pentland, and Hermiston Gate.
''The details of his pay and conditions have been agreed by all
parties. As far as I am concerned, he is being properly rewarded for the
excellent job he is doing.''
A council official said part of the reason for the deal agreed with Mr
Ross and the council-owned company was to compensate for his loss of
local government pension and related benefits.
Mr Ross confirmed to The Herald he would be getting a pay-off if his
contract was not renewed.

Robert McLaughlan argues that dismissing a whole section of
wine-making is no longer justifiable
WINE lovers are too often contemptuous of wines from cooperatives,
suspecting that such products will suffer from the way in which the
makers have to put up with the grapes with which they are supplied
regardless of quality. Whatever power this feeling may have had in the
past, it is no longer justified. At a tasting of the wines of nearly 60
French co-operatives in London last month, the overall impression was of
sound quality at reasomable prices. To some extent that is what a
reasonable person might expect when co-ops make just over half of total
French wine production including more than a third of AOC wines, those
whose grapes are grown and vinified in conformance with specified
controls.
French co-ops themselves have sought and imposed on themselves
additional higher standards, so that although they may not produce the
qualities attained by most single vineyard producers (which is why such
proprietors retain their individual status) they do turn out bottles of
decent wine. (A quick example might be the various Chablis available at
Marks and Spencer: all from La Chablisienne, the Chablis co-op. These
are always dependable -- still something not to be taken for granted in
''Chablis'' -- and easily worth their cost.)
Among co-ops I have visited and remember are the Cave des Vignerons at
Buxy (good for inexpensive Burgundy, especially Montagny white and
Mercurey red); and the Cave de Turckheim in Alsace. About five years
ago, I was able to try on the spot every wine the Turckheim co-op
produced and remember being impressed in particular by their vendanges
tardives (late-picked) Gewurztraminers. These wines in 50cl bottles,
bigger than the EU specified 35.5cls, were memorable; but the generality
of wines from this co-op impressed me as delivering what an old friend
called '' a decent glass of wine,'' and though there are better but much
dearer makers of Alsace, well represented at Threshers, for example, the
Turckheim co-ops need not be passed by (Oddbins are stockists). Their
Tokay Pinot Gris wines are very toothsome: a 1994 tried last month
struck me as as rich but savoury and long lasting and the same grape in
a Grand Cru two years older was extremely good. The Pinot Gris is a
grape with a great future although the two best Alsace are still thought
to be Riesling and Gewurz -- which do not compete on the spot since they
prefer very different soil but which are the source of perpetual debate.
In Turckheim's case I did not try any Rieslings last month but was
enchanted by the voluptuous late-picked Gewurz which easily managed to
impress though served very cold.
Wolfberger is another Alsace co-op worth getting to know and again
Oddbins are stockists. William Low used to stock the Gewurz from the
Cave Vinicole be Bebleheim, a connection which seems to have been lost
now that Low is being Tesco-ised. That must be a loss if their Pinot
Gris, both straight and vendanges tardives are any thing to go by.
Some co-op wines I know only from buying from supermarkets or
encountering in restaurants; like the Cave de Lugny which produces much
Macon Lugny and sparkling Burgundy good enough to be called Cremant,
which is an alternative to Champagne but very much cheaper.
In a different part of the country, sound wine that goes over easily
and enjoyably is made by the Cave du Haut Poitou, which revived wine
making in this area in the 1950s and 60s - both the Chardonny and
Sauvignon VDQS are clean and tasty wines. At the co-op Cave in Saumur
there is also a Cremant de Loire of note, cheaper than its better known
competitors Gratien et Meyer and Langlois Chateau.
One area of numerous co-ops is the Midi, the Languedoc, a region to
which I will return. I did encounter one, however, which has been
selling in Scotland both through John Lamont Wines, a Lanarkshire
importer, and Alliance Wines of Bridge of Weir. This producer was called
Perspectives Export. I was greatly taken by a Cotes du Roussillon white
1994 Sant Joan, Cellier St Jean which Mr Lamont imports; and by a white
Vin de Pays du Mont-Baudile 1993.
Obviously this brief note did not exhaust the list. Two general points
are worth making. First, very few of the wines I tried passed the #10
mark (co-op Champagnes were an exception), and the generality were
around and below a fiver. Secondly, the wines were far from being
eclipsed by New World competitors in the same price range.

ROYAL aides yesterday refused to let the Prince of Wales ride in a
German car to a British trade exhibition in Casablanca.
Moroccan government officials laid on a Mercedes limousine for the
Prince but royal aides insisted on a British Embassy Rover Sovereign.
So when his plane arrived at Casablanca Airport, the royal flag,
mounted on the bonnet, was hurriedly switched from the Mercedes to the
Rover. The only problem was that, although the Rover is British-made,
the company is now controlled by BMW of Germany.
Prince Charles visited the stands of more than 70 British companies at
the exhibition. Later, he visited the spectacular Hassan II Grand Mosque
at Casablanca which, after Medina, is the second largest in the world.
Although he declined to wear a fez for photographers, it is understood
the Prince donned the Tommy Cooper-style hat for a portrait sitting in
private on the royal flight from Fez to Rabat.
The Prince leaves Morocco today and flies back to Britain via Seville
in Spain where he is a guest at the wedding of the Infanta Elena,
daughter of King Juan Carlos.

They've all put their bad reputations well behind them and now the
race is on to exploit the benefits of the diesel. Bill Caven enjoys a
surprisingly smooth drive
TAXI drivers know a thing or two. What's more, they are not exactly
shy at passing on some snippets from their vast knowledge to any hapless
victim unfortunate enough to be sitting in the back of the Black Hack.
But for long enough, they kept relatively shtoom over the virtues of
running a diesel vehicle. Widely regarded as being noisy, smelly, and
offering performance levels that would match only a tortoise, diesel
cars were normally given a wide berth by the private buyer.
That image has changed dramatically, and recent improvements by
virtually all the major car manufacturers has placed diesel cars firmly
back in vogue. Now attracting nearly a quarter of new car purchases,
diesels in the past 12 months have achieved their highest ever annual
sales in the UK at some 430,000.
Among those trying to cut a niche in this growing market sector is the
French giant Citroen, whose renowned class-beating diesel models are
steadily providing a convincing argument towards change.
Now refined, quiet, and with a left-hook that Chris Eubank would be
proud of, Citroen has a diesel option throughout its range, from the AX,
the world's most economical production car, to the executive XM,
recently kitted out with a brand new smooth 2.5 litre turbo diesel
complete with state-of-the-art computer-controlled engine management.
Where the company expects to do most business, however, is in the
medium-sized sector where the ZX competes. A brilliantly simple and
straightforward hatch, the ZX range has been further improved with the
addition of a driver's airbag, seat-belt pretensioners, and side-impact
protection beams now fitted as standard.
In addition, to ensure that a safe Citroen remains intact and with its
rightful owner, two-way alarms, coded immobilisers, unique fit coded
radios, and a whole host of security features have also been
incorporated.
On the road, the ZX, recent winner of the gruelling Granada-Dakar
rally for a second successive year, has retained Citroen's class-leading
ride capabilities. It glides along like a magic carpet no matter the
road conditions. Roadholding and comfort, traditional hallmarks of any
Citroen model, are also evident, thanks to the ZX's clever passive rear
wheel steer suspension.
A week in the company of the 1.9 diesel model turned out to be a
pleasurable experience. For a car of its size, the interior is roomy and
able to transport five adults without any complaints about lack of leg
or headroom. The seating in the Advantage model was also extremely
comfortable and provided an excellent driving position.
The power-assisted steering made light work of negotiating corners
and, at times, it was easy to become rather relaxed, knowing that the
car could handle anything thrown at it.
It is fair to say that the car will not suit budding Damon Hills,
although that's not to say that it cannot perform. The car can reach a
comfortable cruising speed on the motorway in a relatively short period,
and is ultimately capable of reaching the ton.
The gear change is a dream and, unlike some cars in its class, the ZX
has sufficient range to ensure the minimum of change, even when putting
the foot down hard.
Where it really scores is on economy, with a careful driver easily
capable of getting returns of more than 40 miles to the gallon,
especially when driven at a steady 50mph or so.
If you also require a car which can carry all of the family's worldly
goods, the Citroen won't disappoint with its cavernous loadspace.
With a price tag of just under #11,000, it is a safe bet to predict
increased ZX sales in the coming year. Few buyers will end up
disappointed with their choice.

THE state of Scotland's housing is a national scandal and the
Government and Labour-run local authorities are to blame, the Scottish
National Party claimed yesterday.
At a local elections press conference in Edinburgh, the Nationalists'
housing spokesman, Mr Tom Chalmers, said Labour housing policy was in
''as big a mess as much of its housing stock''.
He claimed the party was facing the local elections with no housing
policy and cited as evidence a recent article in a Shelter magazine by
Labour's spokesman, MP John McAllion, which stressed he was speaking in
a personal capacity because the party's housing policies were under
review.
''How can the party which controls the vast bulk of Scotland's public
housing stock have the temerity to enter a major local election campaign
with no housing policy? That is typical of the 'could'nt care less'
attitude which has been the hallmark of Labour's fiefdoms over the
years,'' said Mr Chalmers.
At national level, the Scottish House Condition Survey had shown that
nearly 30% of Scotland's houses were affected by dampness, condensation,
and mould. Of the houses affected by dampness, almost half were in the
public sector.
Against this background, the Tories had cut net housing resources by
11.3% in real terms and were proposing reductions of nearly 20% over the
next three years.
Mr Chalmers said the elections on April 6 provided the opportunity for
people all over Scotland to bring about a fresh start in their councils'
housing policy. For example, SNP-controlled authorities would implement
higher standards of living space, insulation, and security in both
public and private housing.
They would establish an energy-efficient standard for council housing
and new homes, ensuring that a satisfactory average household
temperature could be achieved for less than 10% of household income.
The promotion of energy conservation policies in the new councils was
also promised by the Scottish Liberal Democrats at a press conference in
the capital.

HOUSE buyers in Scotland will be hundreds of pounds worse off because
of Government policy, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said
yesterday.
He told members of the Scottish House Builders Association at a
luncheon that the Government had betrayed home owners and the building
industry.
He said the second cut in Mortgage Interest Relief at Source (Miras),
which would come into effect next month, was ''yet another blow to the
home owner''. Miras has been cut from 25% in 1993/94 to 15% in 1995/96.
Mr Robertson claimed home buyers in Scotland would be #343 a year
worse off because of the reduction in Miras -- the equivalent of an
11.2% increase in the cost of home ownership.
He continued: ''Add that to rising mortgage rates and you have another
massive Tory double-whammy for the home owner and the housing
industry.''
Mr Robertson said the construction industry had been ''hammered'' by
the Government's economic failure.
''No wonder construction workers are languishing on the dole. No
wonder the feel good factor is nowhere in sight. There is only one way
to restore the feel good factor and that is to return a Labour
Government that recognises housing can be the engine of economic
recovery.''
Mr Robertson claimed that the Government would cut spending on housing
by #125m in real terms, or 20%, over the next three years, which would
represent a cash cut of #79m.
He said houses in Scotland were in ''dire need of repair'' and their
neglect amounted to a ''national disgrace''. Mr Robertson pointed to
survey results which showed that three out of 10 homes in Scotland
suffered from damp, condensation, and mould. He warned that the number
of homeless individuals and families was continuing to rise.
''You can't trust the Tories on housing but you can't trust the
Nationalists either,'' he said.
However, Scottish Conservative Party chairman Mr Michael Hirst cast
doubt on Mr Robertson's figures and said the Tories had supported the
construction industry. He said: ''Labour's claim to be the home-owners'
friend is an act of sheer hypocrisy.''
He added that the Conservative policy of selling council houses had
been opposed by the Labour Party. ''Unlike the last Labour Government,
the Conservatives have succeeded in developing low inflation and low
interest rates. This can only help create a positive climate where
people will feel confident in purchasing their own homes.''

A SCOTTISH Office Minister yesterday admitted the constitutional
debate would dominate the forthcoming elections for Scotland's shadow
unitary authorities.
Speaking at the launch of the Conservative campaign for the new
Stirling Council, Mr George Kynoch, the MP for Kincardine and Deeside,
said the arguments over independence, devolution, and the Union would
dominate all political discussions between now and the next General
Election.
However, he said the emptying of dustbins and the ability of local
authorities to set realistic rates of council tax were the real criteria
of judgment at the elections on April 6.
He agreed with the recent statement by former Scottish Conservative
president Sir Michael Hirst that Stirling and Perth and Kinross were
flagship Tory-controlled local authorities which showed how good
services could be delivered on a value for money basis.
''Since 1992, the Conservative-controlled council here in Stirling has
slashed the council tax by 30% while significantly improving services,''
said Mr Kynoch.
''The improvements are there for all to see -- every council house
with new central heating and double glazing by next April. That is no
mean achievement. That is what Conservative local government is all
about.''
He said the party welcomed the fact that decisions over important
things such as rubbish collection, social work, and housing would now be
taken by a new council in Stirling, by Stirling, and for Stirling.
''It is a great opportunity and one which the Labour Party fought in
Parliament tooth and nail. We should never let them forget that,'' he
said.
He said the policies of the other parties over devolution and
independence would also come under the spotlight during the election
campaign as they would be asked to level opposition to local government
reform with their support for new forms of government for Scotland.
''Although the constitutional debate will dominate all political
discussions between now and the next General Election, the judgment on
April 6 will be who can deliver the best services in the local authority
arena,'' he added.

Wendy Jack meets Eric
Dawson, who has gone
from designing walls to
decorating them
ART. Like beauty its appeal is all in the eye of the beholder. Maybe
you've always fancied a few nice pictures around your walls but
hesitated, unsure of what will combine strong appeal with blending
happily into the interior of your home.
Perhaps you've felt tempted to invest in an original but can't quite
afford to splash out yet. Or possibly you are renting a flat or house
for a couple of years and long to put a personalised stamp on someone
else's decor with two or three good pictures.
Eric Dawson is someone whose working life revolves around renting
pictures to other people. Mainly he deals with corporate business, but
he also rents his art to private individuals. His only stipulation, in
either case, is that the rental period must be a minimum of two years --
which rules out lining up an impressive array of pictures for a dinner
party then returning them on Monday morning.
Established in Edinburgh six years ago, BuroArt specialises in fine
prints drawn from around the world. ''As far as limited editions of
prints are concerned, we probably have the widest range available in
Scotland,'' says Dawson. ''We have resources probably second to none.''
In addition to art rental, the company also sells to anyone wishing to
purchase paintings outright.
Originally trained as an architect, Eric Dawson never fully qualified,
turning instead to the interior side of things. Although the general
public are welcome to visit his peaceful gallery on busy Queensferry
Road, the choice of location was a deliberate avoidance of a high street
outlet.
''With architects coming in with plans to discuss ideas, we don't have
a big throughput of customers,'' explains Dawson. ''Although we are
always pleased when people seek us out. We get some amazing requests.
Often customers come to us when they have tramped all over Edinburgh and
Glasgow trying to find what they want. People will ask for the most
obscure thing.
''We don't get involved in fine art and that sort of thing, that's not
our scene, but we buy original contemporary paintings and can commission
direct from the artists. We try to use Scottish painters as much as
possible, but our corporate clientele is frequently international in its
business so we reflect that in our paintings, which I travel extensively
to buy.''
With his trained eye for buildings, a typical job for Dawson will be
to visit a new office building, get the feel of it, run his eye in and
gain an understanding of the company's corporate image -- increasingly
important in today's highly competitive marketplace.
He then brings together a collection of prints or original
contemporary paintings that he feels are appropriate at all levels. Once
the senior people have agreed to his choice, each picture is
custom-framed and hung on the walls. If the lighting is inadequate to do
the art justice he makes recommendations for improving it.
''Our professional input makes sure schemes are co-ordinated and
there's not a motley assortment of pictures, but art that complements
the building and is also of interest to those who work there or visit.
The unique thing about our corporate side is that we can change the
artwork every six months, which makes it both educational and
interesting.
''No matter how good an art scheme is initially, people spend most of
their day in the office and after six to 12 months they'll fail to
notice what's on the walls unless it's of peculiar interest. It's a very
different scenario from the domestic setting, where you buy something
that grows on you because it's your personal taste. On the corporate
side you're dealing with X number of people, all with different
tastes.''
Next time you are in a Scottish airport look around its walls. The
pictures will have been provided by Eric Dawson. How do you choose
paintings for a place where nerves and tempers are regularly frayed?
''They have to appeal to a very general market. Tasteful colour,
contemporary colour that's pleasing and interesting, people are moving
about in airports looking, trying to cool their nerves a bit. They need
something to complement the gin and tonic.''
Alongside oil and insurance giants, power companies and financial
institutions, Dawson also has small fry among his clientele, and even a
hairdresser.
As to price, clearly this is very individual. However, Eric Dawson
says: ''We can provide a nice, high-quality picture, custom framed, for
less than #2 a week.''

THE Scottish Labour co-ordinator for the local elections yesterday
used a campaign launch to renew the party's attack on unelected quangos.
The MP for Paisley North and head of the party's Quango Watch
campaign, Mrs Irene Adams, criticised the growing number of quangos
during the launch of the East Dunbartonshire local election campaign.
She said there would be 1500 elected members in the new Scottish
unitary authorities after the April elections. But she added that there
would be at least 5000 unelected quango members by next year.
The Labour Party manifesto for East Dunbartonshire claims
Government-appointed representatives on quangos will control more public
expenditure than all the new 32 unitary authorities in Scotland.
It also promises a new ''mechanism to monitor the activities of local
quangos and expose their debates and decisions to the public''.
Mrs Adams said she would continue to fight the growth of quangos
across Scotland. At yesterday's launch, she unveiled a new party
document, Standing up for Scotland -- 100 achievements of Scottish
Labour in local government.
She said the East Dunbartonshire campaign was one of the closest in
the country with Labour and Conservatives vying for control in the
highly marginal area. Victory in the council would probably reflect a
''huge'' Labour success across Scotland. Local Labour MPs Sam Galbraith
and Tony Worthington were also at the launch.

had been bitten by a dog.
* Jimmy Ireland, the 1925 Grand Slam hooker, sometimes endured
difficulties securing time off from work to play for his country. On one
occasion he was asked, ''Do you really need the whole day?''
* Twickenham has not been a happy hunting ground for the Scots: only
four victories in 1926, 1938, 1971 and 1983. Ironically, until
Twickenham became England's permanent home in 1911, Scotland had a good
record on Sassenach soil with 10 wins and two draws in 18 starts.
* Robert Stronach (Glasgow Acads.) scored the winning try in the 1905
match. Away from the rugby field Stronach was a brilliant hurdler and
won the 1904 AAA's title in a record 16 seconds. Had he competed in the
Olympic Games later that year his time would have earned him a share of
the gold medal.
* Ronald Cove-Smith may have been a fine player and leader (he
captained the 1927 Lions to South Africa) but he was no judge of player.
The Englishman once said ''... they talk of Eric Liddell, but he has no
speed and lacks the required class''. Yes, that Eric Liddell.
* The Scotland/England series has seen more draws than any other. 17
of the 11 matches have resulted in stalemate, the most recent in 1989,
including six scintillating 0-0 draws.

GOVERNMENT Ministers were out in force in Scotland yesterday to bang
the drum for their frontline troops fighting the local elections on
April 6.
The charge was led by a combative Defence Secretary, Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, who went on the stump round the West of Scotland. Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang trained his firepower on Aberdeen while Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton brought up the rear in Glasgow.
Mr Rifkind shrugged off a prediction by Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson that the Tory ''gerrymandering'' of the new unitary
authorities would lead to their electoral wipe-out.
He said: ''I seem to remember Labour saying much the same before any
election. The more they say it, the more Tory Governments are returned
and the more Tory councils there are.''
Mr Rifkind said the record of Labour and Conservatives in government
spoke for itself. Since 1992 in Scotland, Conservative councils had cut
their council tax while Labour councils had increased theirs. On
average, a Labour council costs people #72 or a thumping 62% more than a
Conservative council.
''We Tories can be proud of our record. We are the party on the side
of the consumer in delivering better services and we are the party on
the side of the council taxpayer in seeking to get maximum value for
their money.''
The fiscal theme was also taken up by Mr Lang at a rally in Aberdeen.
He said Labour's record in local government showed it could not be
trusted to deliver services without delving deep into the pockets of
local taxpayers.
He said: ''You need look no further than Aberdeen for the evidence.
Labour-run Aberdeen has imposed a huge 22% rise in council tax bills
since they took office in 1992. Aberdeen's record is poor even by Labour
standards.
''The average bill faced by council tax payers in Conservative
controlled councils has fallen by 3% since 1992. That contrasts with the
8% rise that Labour councils have imposed on local tax payers.''
Mr Lang also argued that a Scottish Parliament was irrelevant to the
structure of local government unless, and only unless, people intended
that parliament take powers away from local government.
He said: ''That is the dark threat that hangs over our local
government. The new unitary councils would be plundered of their powers
by a parliament in Edinburgh.
''Here in Grampian you would know all about it. Power would flow from
the North-east to the central belt.''
Lord James, meanwhile, argued that Labour's suffocating grip on
Glasgow needed to be loosened. ''It will take time, but we can do it. We
owe the people of Glasgow nothing less,'' he said.

0Wrought-iron has come in from the cold, discovers Beverley Brown as
she visits a modern blacksmith and puts her foot in it
WROUGHT-IRON used to be reserved for garden gates and railings. The
term can still conjure up images of a blacksmith's smiddy with red-hot
metal being laboriously tortured into complicated shapes. But interior
design trends of the nineties have brought it in from the cold, and
wrought-iron is increasingly being used as an alternative to traditional
materials such as wood in a myriad of furniture designs.
I went to see one of Scotland's up-and-coming craftsmen at work.
Self-taught, with no artistic training, David McFadzean runs David Lewis
Designs from a workshop adjacent to his brother's garage in the village
of Fenwick, just off the A77.
It was a meeting that quite literally got off on the right foot;
entering the garage I stepped on a piece of metal that pierced the sole
of my shoe and embedded itself in my right foot. Formalities were
forgotten as McFadzean deftly removed the offending splinter, adding
''honestly, I don't usually 'nail' clients to the floor'' to his
repertoire of greetings.
A quick look round the workshop convinced me that he wouldn't have to.
In one corner stood his latest commission, a magnificent double bed.
Surprise number one was that it looked like steel, not wrought-iron. The
second surprise was that despite furtively scanning the room there did
not appear to be a fire or a pair of bellows in sight.
''Wrought-iron has really become a generalisation for all metal
furniture,'' explained McFadzean. ''Most of my designs are made from a
high-quality solid steel known as brightbar. This suits me because I
tend to favour very clean, simple lines but if I need to produce more
complicated shapes I use blackbar, which is less brittle and therefore
more malleable.'' And lack of fire? ''Wrought-iron traditionally
involved heat but technology has improved and my designs are basically
so streamlined that brute force and an electric Mig welder are all I
need.''
David Lewis Designs began trading in 1992. Before that he worked with
his brother John in the garage, principally welding cars and doing
bodywork repairs. Making furniture was a hobby which grew in tandem with
his welding prowess but David McFadzean has not had any professional
training -- a factor he now feels is responsible for the originality of
his designs.
Having decided to commit all his resources to the furniture business,
McFadzean received advice and backing from Ayrshire Enterprise and began
to build a collection.
The first thing he made was a glass-topped console table. Side
pedestal, telephone and coffee tables with bevelled glass inserts,
mirrors, and curtain poles followed.
''I didn't have professional photographs at that point,'' said
McFadzean. ''But I did the rounds of all the major stores with my own
photographs and tried to make appointments to see buyers. My first two
breaks came from the Furniture Union in Glasgow and Tony Walker Home
Interiors in Edinburgh, who commissioned a console table. They displayed
several items in their Edinburgh showroom and later on Frasers in
Glasgow followed.''
Outlets have to expand and David McFadzean is currently featured in
the 1995 Year of the Entrepreneur scheme promoted by Scottish
Enterprise. He has also expanded his designs to cater for shopfitting.
''An optician in Princess Square was being refurbished and I was
invited to submit a few ideas,'' he said. ''The focal point became an
immense mirror'' in what he describes as a ''squashed down diamond which
loosely resembles the shape of an eye''. At two-and-a-half metres long,
it's a big mirror. He then added tables and chairs and the result is a
practical, highly streamlined, and sophisticated shop interior.
Although still a one-man band, David McFadzean knows exactly where he
is going. ''I have already invested more than #1000 in equipment and
within the next year I would hope to take on one or two people with
basic skills to help with the time-consuming preparation work. I would
also like to add beds to my collection and extend into shopfitting.
Quality workmanship and finish is everything in this business and my
ambition is for the company to expand and become renowned for the
quality of its designs,'' he added.
McFadzean's talent and sheer enthusiasm impressed me so much I forgot
about my foot. I was also too busy trying to figure out how the lucky
owner of the bed was going to get it through his doorway.
* David McFadzean will undertake one-off commissions. Tel: 01560 600
800 for details. Items from his collection can be purchased from Tony
Walker Home Interiors in Edinburgh, Tel: 0131 343 6151. VAT-inclusive
prices range from #180 for mirrors, #150 for pedestal tables, #240 for
console tables, and from #360 for coffee tables.

* SCOTLAND and England first met on 27 March, 1871 at Raeburn Place,
Edinburgh and Scotland won by virtue of a hotly disputed try. HH Almond,
the umpire who awarded the try, said afterwards ''... that when an
umpire is in doubt, I think he is justified in deciding against the side
which makes most noise. They are most probably in the wrong.''
* ODDLY, given the amount of comment Scotland have attracted over the
years for casting the selectorial net far and wide, the England side
that lost to our first Grand Slam heroes at Murrayfield in 1925,
contained three Scots-born players.

POLICE have be asked to investigate an alleged election irregularity
at Bridgeton in the East End of Glasgow where there is to be a straight
fight between Labour and SNP at the single-tier council poll next month.
If proven, the allegation could invalidate one of the party
nominations, although a challenge against the election result afterwards
would be the more likely possibility.
It is understood the allegation relates to a signature on the
nomination form of the SNP candidate, Ms Nicola Sturgeon. Her opponent
at Bridgeton is Ms Elaine Smith.
* Three contestants who were each nominated in two wards in Dumfries
and Galloway have decided which they will fight.
Mr Colin Arkless has withdrawn from Lochnaw and will contest Aird.
This means Mr John Agnew (Independent) will be returned unopposed in
Lochnaw. Mr Eric Archibald has withdrawn from Cairnpat and will contest
Logan. Mr William Clemie has withdrawn from Kirkcudbright (South) to
contest Kirkcudbright (North).

HEATHER ROSE
discovers that these
days curtains can be
mere window-dressing
IF curtains for you are simply a screen of cloth to be drawn come
nightfall for the sake of privacy and keeping draughts at bay, then it's
time to draw a veil over those outmoded views.
Curtain style has come in from the cold. They have been transformed
into an art form with a fashion format of their very own.
Today's hi-tech homes have played a considerable part in bringing
about this furnishing revolution. High-performance double and even
triple-glazed windows mean curtains no longer have to act as a shield to
chilly weather.
With central heating now an in-built feature even in properties
housebuilders term ''affordable'' -- those aimed at first-time buyers --
the fireplace, for so long the focal point of living areas, is rapidly
disappearing. As a result, windows are being seen in a new light, and
curtains are a fashionable frame for this new point of view.
No-one knows this better than Harrison Drape, one of the leading names
on this side of the window-dressing business. In the past few weeks it
has come up with a host of novel window-dressing ideas.
One of the most revolutionary is the range of supertracks, high
specified curtain tracks which, it claims, are so easy to instal that
even a child can do it. This product launch follows research revealing
that fitting curtain tracks is one of the most dreaded of household
chores. Installation is regarded as a complicated and difficult
business.
Now with Supertracks those thoughts are being cast aside. A quick-fix,
easy-release bracket is providing the key to this simplicity. It allows
the track to be simply snapped on and off instead of being screwed into
the wall. Only installation necessary is in fixing the brackets to the
wall -- just one screw in each.
Removing the track is no problem. The bracket is simply snapped back
again. Not only that, the whole track can be lifted off for cleaning or
decorating.
From this spring, sagging net curtains have also become a thing of the
past thanks to another innovation, Tensionet. This is a plastic net
curtain support which can be easily cut to size and, because it has a
plastic core, will not rust. A unique buckle makes it easily adjustable
with excess plastic snipped off.
Other new ideas taking windows away from the interior design shadows
this year include the Classical collection of curtain poles, the Da
Vinci collection of decorative curtain accessories, and the Jo Alderson
collection of ready-made roller blinds, which come with co-ordinating
soft furnishing fabrics.
Window poles took on a higher profile in the late 1970s, but those
framing windows these days are quite different from those of the past
couple of decades. Very much a decorative feature in their own right,
the newest versions have a rustic, hand-carved look giving them much
more individuality, with wrought-iron fast becoming a big story in home
interiors.
One of the new breed of curtain accessories could be of special
interest to parents of young children. New to the market is a Fleur de
Lys holdback, again from Harrison Drape, which is not only decorative
but incorporates a unique safety feature. It is mounted on a
spring-loaded bracket. If the holdback is accidentally knocked, the
spring mechanism has been designed to absorb the impact and the motif
gives rather than remains rigid.
This year, too, there is no need to despair if you are unable to find
ready-made curtains that match both your purse and window sizes -- and
if you are a non-sewer and cannot afford to have them made up for you.
Rufflette, which manufactures curtain tapes, has come up with its new
No-Sew curtain kits. Each contains iron-on heading and hemming tapes,
hooks, cord tidies, and an instruction leaflet. Available in either
pencil or gathered headings, the only other items required are tape
measure, iron and ironing board plus fabric and scissors.

tests has won a 25-year pension battle with defence chiefs in what was
yesterday hailed as a breakthrough for veterans.
The Rev Laurence Deverall, 60, developed cancer in his right leg after
he was exposed to radiation in the 1956 Maralinga tests in South
Australia during National Service.
The Ministry of Defence vigorously rejected his claim for a pension
after his leg was amputated in 1970.
However, the Pensions Appeal Tribunal, which was ordered by the High
Court to hear his case again last December, ruled the cancer was
attributable to his service as an RAF medical orderly at Maralinga.
Mr Mike Reid, a member of the executive committee of the British
Nuclear Tests Veterans' Association, hailed the result as a vital
breakthrough.
''It is a very good result indeed and it gives hope to the other
veterans,'' he said. ''It is now time for the MoD to start paying
compensation to veterans without them having to go to appeal hearings.''
The veterans' association has taken its case to the European Court of
Justice in Strasbourg in a bid to force the MoD to concede that cancers
from which its members suffer are the result of radiation exposure.
Mr Deverall, who emigrated from Woking, Surrey, to Alberta in Canada
30 years ago, welcomed the tribunal's decision.

Just glance at the crowd at a junior football game or even a boxing
match. What's usually missing from the cheering throng? Women.
There's something about certain sports that dictates they are largely
male preserves.
Rugby, on the other hand, has always had a family feel about it. A
football fan passing through Corstorphine recently on his way to a match
was amazed to see large numbers of women, decked out in tartan and
brandishing Scottish flags, heading for Murrayfield and the clash with
the Welsh which has set up the Grand Slam finale to the Five Nations
Championship.
It's always been that way. At clubs from Annan to Aberdeen, women have
traditionally cheered from the sidelines and then made the teas. Their
reward is a day out -- at a rugby international.
The days of a rugby bus leaving in the morning and heading for a bit
of pre-match lunch, the game, and the post-match revelry along Rose
Street are largely in the past. The arrival of debentures, corporate
hospitality, and increased prices, as well as the woefully small ticket
allocation to clubs, has seen to that.
But still the stalwarts head for Murrayfield.
A football match is over in a flash (for some teams just as well) but
rugby supporters view their visits to Edinburgh as a pilgrimage.
Women who watch their children play mini rugby, who encourage the
third XV on a cold January afternoon, are made of stern stuff. They know
every song in the prop's repertoire, and possibly a couple of extra
verses, and at Murrayfield sing Flower of Scotland at the tops of their
voices.
It's pies and Bovril at the junior game but a look around at the
crowds in the car park in the shadow of Murrayfield shows middle
Scotland at play. Lunchtime picnics range from Lockerbie pies to Fortnum
and Mason hampers, from Boddingtons to Bolliger. This is all part of the
build-up and, of course, the women are handy for dishing out the chicken
legs.
The conversation, often oblivious to the cheering, can also be
wide-ranging. At one recent international, Cynthia and Belinda were
heard deeply engrossed in a discussion over what to wear to a
forthcoming Hunt ball -- you don't often hear that at Brockville.
However, for every one who would be taxed to tell you the difference
between a line-out and a scrum, who think a hooker surely can't be on a
rugby pitch, or that mauling is something that happens in the zoo
further along the road, there is another woman as knowledgeable as the
men about the strengths and weaknesses of their team.
Game over, they make their way into town and the traditional visit to
as many pubs as possible before heading home with a hangover and
hopefully a victory to recall.

ONE thousand feet above Loch Ness, Gavin Robertson is at work, back
where he belongs in his beloved Inverness-shire, after pursuing his
furniture-making skills on the other side of the globe in Australia,
writes WENDY JACK. With him when he returned to his native heath to set
up his own studio/workshop was Julie, the Sydney-born girl who captured
his heart, now his wife and the mother of their four-year-old daughter.
Twenty-nine-year-old Robertson left Inverness to train at High
Wycombe, the centre of UK furniture-making, where he developed his
skills and gained distinction.
''I had the good fortune,'' he says, ''to have as my external assessor
Martin Grierson, a leading British furniture designer and maker, who
recently did the Heritage Secretary's office. I worked for him for about
two years. It was an invaluable experience.''
Gavin Robertson followed his two older sisters to Australia, working
for one of the country's leading furniture manufacturers, designing and
making the prototypes of pieces that would later go into production.
It's two years since he set up his studio high above Loch Ness at
Abriachan. ''Currently,'' he reports, ''I'm doing pretty well.'' He is
conscious of, and proud of, the important contribution craftsmen such as
he can make to the Scottish economy, with broad-spectrum cottage-type
industries making a significant boost to exports.
The business embraces domestic commissions -- one was a table for a
princess of the Kuwaiti royal family -- and those from the corporate
sector, an area he hopes to build upon. Robertson has recently designed
and produced boardroom furniture in American black walnut for the
Grampian Country Food Group in Aberdeen, while the officers' mess at RAF
Kinloss has been enhanced by some of his bookcases.
''Last year I tried to push Scottish oak. I did a lot of solid dining
tables, refectory style, and people liked the idea. I get the native oak
from Newtonmore. I can get other timber from a Yorkshire company if it's
not available here, the American hardwoods for example.''
The kind of loving care Gavin Robertson lavishes on his designs means
that details such as handcut dovetails in drawers, as would be found on
an antique, are commonplace on his furniture. Before us as we spoke was
a handsome dining table with a Scottish oak underframe, topped with the
light beauty of sycamore. It was solid and traditional, yet had a
certain style that placed it in the nineties. His mirrors, classical,
pale, simple, hung above.
It's difficult, Robertson explains, to be very specific about prices
for his commissions, because obviously there are variations in each job.
He puts his charges, however, around ''the upper end of High Street
prices'', adding ''I have to be as competitive as I can''.
Julie Robertson, a former fashion consultant, helps him with the
organisation of the business and seems to have taken very well to life
in the Highlands. ''She's even getting an Invernessian accent,'' jokes
her husband.

THE Calcutta Cup. It is one of the quaint curiosities of rugby union
that Scotland and England should play each other annually for a trophy
that has it origins in India.
Today at Twickenham, amongst the other spoils up for grabs in this
winner-takes-all Grand Slam contest, will be the Calcutta Cup, currently
held by England and competed for between the two countries in 101
previous matches.
The trophy was, in fact, a gift to the Rugby Football Union from the
Calcutta Football club, first formed in 1873 and consisting mainly of
former pupils of Rugby School in England whose cultural baggage included
what is now one of the world's great sports.
Depite initial enthusiasm for rugby amongst the ex-patriot community,
the game declined as other sports, better suited to the climate, gained
greater popularity. The lack of fixtures had the consequent knock on
effect on bar takings and plunged the Calcutta Football Club into an
unsustainable financial position, forcing its committee to take drastic
measures.
In 1877 it was decided by its members to close down the club but there
remained the question of what to do about the reamining funds, amounting
to some #60. It was the club captain, secretary, and treasurer, G A J
Rothney, who came forward with the idea that the funds be used to make a
challenge trophy for use by the Rugby Football Union as a memento of the
Calcutta Club.
When the proposal was accepted by the Rugby Football Union, the
Calcutta Club then withdrew from the bank its remaining funds in silver
rupees. These were then melted down and worked by the finest Indian
craftsmen into what is now the famous Calcutta Cup.
The 18-inch high trophy, which has three distictive handles fashioned
in the shape of cobras and an elephant surmounting the elegant lid, was
presented to the RFU in 1878 and first played for between Scotland and
England in 1879.
That match, on March 10, 1879 at Raeburn Place resulted in a 3-3 draw,
Scotland scoring a dropped goal and England a penalty goal. Since then
England have won the cup 51 times, Scotland 36 and there have been 13
subsequent draws.
Few will need reminding that Scotland's most recent win in the
Calcutta Cup was in the 1990 match when, as will be the case today at
Twickenham, it was an all-or-nothing game.
Since then England have kept their hands on the famous trophy, the
base of which records among the names of all the captains, the
inscription of one William David Charles Carling a record six times,
exceeding by one that of Mark Morrison, the Royal High School FP who led
Scotland between 1899 and 1904.
The late 1980s saw one slight hiccup, when the Calcutta Cup went
absent without leave at the after match dinner, resulting in the
valuable trophy requiring careful craftsmanship to repair a dent, the
consequence, it is believed, of handling skills that were below par
during an excursion to Edinburgh's pub-land.
England's domination between 1951 and 1963 was punctuated only by
three draws before Scotland's fortunes took a turn for the better.
Scotland's biggest ever Calcutta Cup win was in 1986 when they
defeated England 33-6 at Murrayfield, 21 of the Scotland points scored
by their current captain Gavin Hastings. That result more than atoned
for the 30-18 defeat inflicted by Billy Beaumont's Grand Slam side in
1980.
Draws, too, have claimed their own share of drama, the most famous in
recent times being the 1982 Calcutta Cup match at Murrayfield when Andy
Irvine sent the ball between the posts to achieve a draw for Scotland in
an otherwise forgettable game.
It was Irvine, too, whose touchline penalty -- again in injury time --
gave Scotland a dramatic 16-14 win over England at Murrayfield in 1974
in an exciting match where the lead changed four times. But when it
comes to injury-time penalties Scots fans, still feel aggrieved at
England's 15-14 win last season.
In 1971, Scotland achieved a rare win at Twickenham, the first since
1938, the lasting memory of which will always be Peter Brown's touchline
conversion of Chris Rea's try to give the Scots a dramatic 16-15
victory. Since then Scotland have only once triumphed at RFU
headquarters, when they defeated England 22-12 in 1983, 12 years on from
the 1971 win.
So will a further gap of 12 years produce yet another Calcutta Cup win
at Twickenham?
Saturday will supply the answer.

FOR women of such distinction they have receded into history,
remembered nowadays in derogatory phrases such as ''bawling like a
fishwife'', writes WENDY JACK.
Yet from the fifteenth century up to as late as 1950, the fishwives'
cry of ''caller herrings . . . caller herrings'' (meaning fresh herring)
was a familiar one in and around Edinburgh.
The women themselves, from all accounts, were a colourful and
attractive lot in their costumes of kilted skirt, striped petticoat, and
with a mutch, or handkerchief, round their heads.
Indeed, so eye-catching were they that they turned the head of George
IV on a visit to the capital in 1822. Quite bowled over by their style,
he declared them to be the handsomest women he'd ever seen. Praise
indeed.
Later that century a group of 18 fishwives visiting London to attend a
fisheries exhibition created such a stir that their costumes were
adopted by London couturiers, promptly sailing onwards and upwards to
become the fashion of the day.
Along with their good looks and distinctive clothing the fishwives
were well known for their quick wit and repartee when necessary. They
were certainly sturdy Scottish lassies, noted for their strength as they
carried their fish in creels to the city from Newhaven on their backs .
. . herring about all over the place, one might say.
During the early nineteenth century the Prestonpans pottery William
Cadell &amp; Co produced a variety of finely-modelled Scottish figures -- or
dabbities -- which included a fishwife, currently in the collection of
the National Museums of Scotland. Made around 1820, the figure shows the
fishwife, creel on back, trudging purposefully off to sell her silvery
shoal on Edinburgh's streets. It is believed that the figure's demeanour
and humour makes it likely that it was modelled on a local character.
Now the Griselda Hill Pottery in Ceres, Fife, has obtained agreement
from the National Museums to produce a limited edition of the fishwife
modelled on the original.
Made in Fife at the pottery, each figure, says Griselda Hill, ''will
be authentically hand-painted to match the original and will carry a
number on its base. I will sign a certificate of authenticity and each
figure will come in a presentation box.''
A few months ago Griselda Hill became well known as the ceramicist
synonymous with the revival of Wemyss Wear Pottery, which she reproduces
at Ceres. A number of her Wemyss Wear pieces, which had been bought some
years ago by the famed Edinburgh character and collector, the late Iris
Fox, came up for sale when the Fox collection was auctioned by Sothebys
in Edinburgh for in excess of half a million pounds.
Griselda Hill's fishwife -- a strictly limited edition of 195 -- will
cost, she explains, ''#99.50 which includes postage. We will be
launching her in May, but orders are being taken now and will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.''
Payment is not required at the moment. Customers reserving their
fishwife will be invoiced when it is ready to be despatched.

ON the face of it even before a ball is kicked at Twickenham this
afternoon the sure winners are the ticket touts. People have been paying
ludicrous prices in anticipation of a certain English victory.
Or are the touts doing as well out of this game as usual? Last night
they were just as desperate to get their hands on briefs for the Grand
Slam showdown as anyone else in London. ''Sorry we are in the business
of buying at the moment,'' one tout told me. ''We are prepared to pay
#500.
''Probably we will be able to get you a ticket for the match. It will
cost you #800, but I can't promise anything at this stage.''
Those who have got them are holding on to them, or passing them on to
their friends.
This is one of the most eagerly awaited rugby internationals of all
time.
They have been talking little else in London over the past few days
and there can be no question about it, down here they think Scotland
haven't a chance.
One of the UK's biggest companies has already ordered space in Monday
morning's English newspapers for advertisements heralding the English
victory. A standby advertisement to appear in the Scottish press in the
unlikely event of Scotland coming out victorious has been scrapped,
because this bears no reality to the likely outcome.
Exiles, including myself, are kicking themselves because they believed
all the pre-Five Nations tournament hype coming from Scotland, that we
had not the slightest chance of winning any of the games this season.
We did not bother applying to local clubs for tickets when the
opportunity arose and the chances were good.
For the past two weeks, telephone lines between Scotland and England
have been buzzing, expressing concern for the health of old friends,
with the conversation ending with the now familiar request: ''I don't
suppose you have a spare ticket for the match?''
Worse still for those of us living down here, we all know individuals
who have not the slightest interest in rugby who have been offered
lavish champagne corporate entertainment, a four-course lunch, and a
free ticket to the game.
Colleague William Russell comes into this category. He had the cheek
to ask yesterday: ''Incidentally, how do you get to Twickenham?''
The only comfort left to the vast majority is that you get a better
view of the game on television.
As usual, the Scots will be very much in the minority at Twickenham
today. Still, they will enjoy themselves before the match and as long as
they can. They will take comfort from the fact that Gavin and the boys
have done extraordinarily well this season against all the odds.
At least until the referee blows his whistle to start the game, the
prospect remains that this could be the most glorious of all weekends.
* The production line of Border knitwear giant Pringle of Scotland is
on red alert in the event of a Scottish victory.
Key workers will be on duty at the firm's Hawick factory, ready to
embroider jerseys if fortune favours the Scots.

NO matter who wins today, Will Carling or Gavin Hastings will leave
Twickenham empty handed -- because of ground redevelopments.
Today's winners are due to receive the new Five Nations Trophy and the
century-old Calcutta Trophy, but captains Carling and Hastings are to be
denied the chance to lift the silverware in front of Twickenham's
sell-out crowd and will have to wait until the after-match banquet to
receive the trophies.
Five Nations committee secretary Bob Weighill explained: ''Owing to
the rebuilding programme at Twickenham, there is no suitable place or
opportunity to make the presentation on the ground immediately following
the end of the match.
''After an exhaustive study of the safety and security implications,
it has been decided that it would be impractical to make the
presentation without the proper facilities and safeguards in place.''
Carling believes the presentation should be made at the top of the
steps in the new West Stand, where TV and radio broadcasters sit, but
the committees and distinguished guests, who normally present trophies,
are in the South East corner and officials fear the winning captain
might not get the big trophies safely back across the ground through
hoards of spectators.

AMONG Scots sporting heroes there is just one ''King Kenny'', that
soccer genius who performed for club and country up here, before heading
south to show the English how the game should be played.
Later this afternoon, Scotland -- and England -- may have found a
successor to that title, when Kenny Logan trots out in the famous dark
blue at Twickenham.
The Stirling County flyer is the golden boy of Scottish rugby, and
going into today's Grand Slam decider, much is expected of him, perhaps
more than most.
That doesn't worry the Kenny in the slightest. After all, he didn't
choose that label, but he'll wear it all the same if it keeps others
happy.
''I'm still the same guy, no matter what is said about me. Some see me
playing for Scotland and think great, a star.
''But I don't think I'm anything special, especially when I'm up to my
ankles in manure,'' says the 22 year-old, who mixes farming with rugby
-- only he didn't say manure.
Had schoolboy trials with Dundee or Hearts worked out, it could have
been Logan the goalie instead of the galloping winger. However, the
14-times capped wide boy wouldn't swap his current lot for anything the
round-ball code could have offered.
''The way I am as a person, it just would never have suited me being a
footballer. I'm happy playing rugby and with the way I'm treated because
of it.
''When I walk down the street, folk ask about the team, and wish you
all the best even when they only know your face from the television or
papers and don't know a thing about rugby, other than you play it. How
many Scotland footballers would get that?
''Everything has gone right for me this season, with Stirling winning
the McEwan's League title, and with Scotland, and honestly, I wouldn't
change what I've got just now for anything.''
Parallels have been drawn between Logan and Aussie ace David Campese,
which, as long as they refer only to rugby activities, Kenny will go
along with.
''I like the way he approaches the game and how he plays it. He
attacks and gets the crowd buzzing, and so do I. But there's no way I'd
go around thinking I was better than anyone. No-one would last two
minutes thinking that way either at the club, or with Scotland.
''I mean, what have I done compared to some guys in the side who have
captained their country, won Grand Slams, and been on Lions tours. Now
tell me who's the superstar.
''I've enjoyed the publicity and the picture calls, because it might
not last very long. It's good fun, but that's all it is. I don't ever
see myself appearing in catalogues modelling clothes more than I'd want
to play rugby.
''If they want to build me up, good. Guaranteed, the same ones will
want to knock me down. I don't worry about the praise I get, I won't be
too concerned if they decide to criticise me either.''
Logan has avoided anything like that, even as a member of the side
trounced by South Africa last November, and despite not yet having
recorded the touchdown he promised himself in this seasons Five Nations
series.
''If it hadn't been for Simon Geoghegan tackling me when I didn't have
the ball -- when Craig Joiner scored in the Ireland game -- or for a
forward pass against the Welsh, I would have done it.
''But I feel I'm playing my part. I helped set the try up in the last
game for Eric Peters and from my point of view, that was as good as
scoring -- well, maybe not quite as good.
''I did score against Argentina last summer, but I really wanted one
at Murrayfield. I suppose I'll settle for one at Twickenham instead.''
Kenny is desperate to play in this, the big one. Nevertheless, you're
left with the impression that he'd be just as mad keen even if it was an
obscure 3rd XV game this Saturday.
Logan sidestepped and skirted around the England clash. Just another
game he says, until you mention how highly others rate the English back
division and ask him for an assessment of them and the game.
''If we win, it will be because we've made it happen. There isn't one
player who doesn't think we can do it. Only after you win can you enjoy
it -- and if we do, I might not see Stirling for a while'' he smiles.

Scottish Neighbourhood Watch groups, reports AILEEN LITTLE, have set
up their own national body
IF your personal nightmare is thieves making off with your worldly
goods, take heart: housebreaking in Scotland decreased by 14% between
1992 and 1993, the most recent Scottish Office figures. It is a fact
attributable in no small measure to the proliferation of neighbourhood
watch schemes, which have increased by 50% in the past two years; and in
areas served by such groups housebreaking statistics continue to go
down.
Seven years ago, for example, there was no scheme in the Eastwood area
of Strathclyde. Now there are 123, according to Frank McGee, chairman of
Eastwood's crime prevention panel and public relations officer for the
fledgling Neighbourhood Watch Association of Scotland.
Once considered the domain of middle-class busybodies peering from
behind net curtains, watch schemes are now regarded by most UK police
forces as a key factor in the Partnership Against Crime initiative
launched last September by Home Secretary Michael Howard. Chief
Superintendent Hugh McGie of Lothian and Borders police describes his
area's 700 NW groups as ''an enormous interface with 48,000 households
-- the biggest untapped community network between the public and the
police''.
And that network is to be put on an official footing. NW is fast
becoming an effective support structure at local, county, and now
national level on both sides of the Border. Following the lead of
England and Wales, Kirkcaldy resident Tony Cahill is hard at work
establishing a national voice in Scotland.
Tony Cahill is chairman of the NW Association of Scotland's steering
committee, which comprises representatives from 10 Scottish areas. He
has been closely involved in developments south of the Border, having
attended the England-Wales meeting to discuss their draft constitution.
But although the Scottish association is following the same format in
many respects, Scottish laws and aptitudes necessitate some parting of
the ways: Scots do not support street patrols or special constables, for
instance.
Already the job takes up an enormous amount of his time. A control
room monitor at Digital in South Queensferry, he has NW meetings every
week. He is vice-chairman of his local NW association and is on the
crime prevention panel for Kirkcaldy.
Similarly his English counterpart, schoolteacher Margaret Filley,
finds NW has taken over her life. ''In my county of Hampshire, 45 new
schemes are set up each month. Growth throughout the country is of the
same order. I'm working till 1am addressing new groups.''
Those at the forefront of the movement believe NW works at two levels.
First, and most obviously, there is home security. Groups make corporate
use of crime prevention officers who organise home surveys, advice on
property marking, and general security. Most experts believe
housebreaking is preventable: in nine case out of 10 a window or door
has been left open.
But it is the second NW prerequisite -- neighbourliness -- which seems
to fire proponents with missionary zeal. The principle is that
volunteers work in partnership with themselves as well as the police,
keeping eyes and ears open in informal surveillance. For nosiness read
helpfulness. They're talking vigilance, not vigilantism.
Margaret Filley waxes lyrical about the role NW plays in her vision of
a return to a caring Britain. ''A lot of our social problems are to do
with the breakdown of community. Neighbourhood means regeneration of
quality life. Watch means awareness and alertness. Together they form a
cocoon -- one can't flourish in a community that doesn't care,'' argues
Ms Filley, who has started a children's NW group in the belief that the
young are the nation's strongest resource.
Tony Cahill does not apologise for grandiose ideals either -- but he
knows it will take time. And he has no doubt that national associations
will help in the fight against crime. ''There are downward trends in
some NW areas, but not all. It's our responsibility to find out why that
is.''
He expects a Scottish headquarters to be in operation by the end of
the year -- most likely in the Kirkcaldy offices of General Accident, a
company that is putting #1m into UK crime prevention this year (10%
comes to Scotland).
But will NW work where it is needed most -- in the crime-ridden
estates which are allegedly no-go police areas? ''It's our duty to give
people an opportunity to report crime without fear of reprisals. We can
arrange for anonymous tip-offs and for people to attend meetings outwith
their area. We're not after all serving only the haves.''

SENIOR police officers in Paisley yesterday went public on Operation
Dragon, an intensive exercise designed to ''turn up the heat'' on the
town's drug and gun sub-culture.
Divisional commander Chief Superintendent Michael Currie said: ''This
is not a knee-jerk reaction to the current drugs and gun problem in
Paisley. We have resolutely tackled these problems for years.
''It is not a quick-fix operation but part of a long-term strategy. We
have a very detailed knowledge of the drugs scene in the area.''
In the past week, a series of shooting incidents has shocked Paisley
and Renfrewshire, culminating in the murder of a 31-year-old man on his
doorstep on Tuesday. Chief Constable Leslie Sharp, of Strathclyde, said
on Thursday that he was confident that the current policing operation
would resolve the problems very soon.
Chief Superintendent Currie confirmed yesterday that the violence
stemmed from a power struggle among criminals for control of the
distribution of drugs.
Operation Dragon will be a high-profile exercise targeted in certain
parts of the area where they were aware that dealers operated and that
firearms were involved.
There would be a CID operation to back up uniformed officers in order
to ''turn up the heat on drug and gun criminals to make further inroads
into the drug culture''. The police wanted more co-operation from the
public, he said, guaranteeing callers anonymity.
''We have a great deal of information at the moment but what we need
is evidence to enable us to deal effectively with the drug dealers and
the gunmen,'' he said.
Asked about reports of a ''shoot to kill policy'', Chief
Superintendent Currie dismissed this as the result of ''hysterical
reporting''.

Detectives yesterday issued a photograph of a jacket which they hoped
would be a vital clue in the hunt for two teenage gunmen who threatened
policemen and held a family hostage.
Two traffic officers, on routine patrol in Paisley last Monday
evening, saw the youths behaving suspiciously in Howard Street and gave
chase, but the teenagers threatened them with a handgun and managed to
escape.
Later that night, the youths broke into a tenement flat in Clarence
Street, Paisley, and held a man, his wife, and their three-year-old son
for two and a half hours before escaping in the family's car.
Yesterday, police issued a photograph and description of a ''very
distinctive'' jacket found near the scene of the incident involving the
traffic policemen. The inner lining of the jacket bears the label Dapa
Confezioni.
Meanwhile, detectives are investigating an armed robbery at the Bank
of Scotland in Busby Road, Clarkston, Glasgow, yesterday afternoon.
A security guard was walking from the bank to his van with a bag
containing a five-figure sum of money when he was confronted by two
masked men armed with a wooden baton and what is believed to have been a
firearm.
The guard was struck with the baton and his attackers ran off with the
money bag to a nearby getaway car.

THE biggest problem for the Scots at Twickenham today may not be
coping with the English team -- but coping with their ghostwriters.
One of Ireland's most influential rugby writers has revealed that no
fewer than 10 of Will Carling's team -- including Carling himself -- are
contracted to English newspapers. And he has warned that this trend of
''internationals selling their views to the highest bidder'' is damaging
the game and relations between players.
Edmund Van Esbeck, respected correspondent with the Irish Times, also
distributes the big match press tickets at Landsdowne Road. Before the
Irish international against England this season, he says he was
approached by three ghostwriters who wanted immediate access to ''their
players'' after the game.
He deplores this development as unhealthy and damaging. ''Of course
there are rich pickings for the 'exclusive' comments of internationals
penned by ghostwriters'' he says. ''But whatever happened to the law
which prohibited players from criticising opponents and referees?
''The current trend of players rushing into print, prompted by
ghostwriters to be as controversial as possible, is creating an
unhealthy atmosphere both before and after international matches. The
more controversial and sensational the comments and accusations, the
better the material so far as some are concerned.''
Van Esbeck, the doyen of Irish rugby writers, says that, as a result
of players rushing into print, psychological warfare now seems to have
become part of the build up to internationals.
He cites comments made about the Irish front row both before and after
their match with England by Brian Moore, Victor Ubogu, and Jason
Leonard, all contracted to newspapers. And he adds: ''The position in
rugby has reached a totally unacceptable level. Players are now accusing
their opponents of cheating, players are now rushing out to give their
after match 'story' to the ghostwriter and to hell with the consequences
for rugby or the players.''
Van Esbeck urges: ''Those who frame the laws in relation to the game
to take a close look at what is happening'' and warns that the
consequences for rugby could be serious, particularly with the World Cup
on the way.

THE new King and Queen were there, along with 70,000 spectators. They
saw one of the most pulsating matches of all time. At the end Scotland
had beaten England 21-16 at Twickenham to clinch the International
Championship, the Calcutta Cup and the Triple Crown.
That was on March 19, 1938 -- the Scots have never been able to repeat
that treble at the English HQ since ... though they can go one better
this afternoon.
Leading the Scottish forwards that memorable day was a Glasgow
Academical, Laurie Duff. He is now 82-years-young, living in
Stirlingshire, still keeping in touch with another survivor from the
winning side, centre Duncan Macrae of St Andrew's University.
There was no fixture against France in 1938. The Scottish Rugby Union
had fallen out with their French counterparts over alleged payments
seven years earlier -- some things never change -- and the rift was not
healed until after the Second World War. Scotland, therefore, opened
their season with a squeaky 8-6 victory over Wales at Murrayfield.
As Laurie recalls: ''It was a desperately hard match and our winning
penalty by back row man Wilf Crawford of United Services was right on
the final whistle.''
They perked up, however, with a sound 23-14 success over Ireland, also
at Murrayfield. ''Springy'' Forrest, the Cambridge University winger,
bagged a couple of tries and the aforementioned Macrae had another. It
was all to play for at Twickers.
Laurie was rooming that weekend with the Scotland captain Wilson Shaw,
the player who was to write his name in neon lights all over the match.
Before that there were several dramas to be overcome.
At lunch on the day of the game it was discovered that the Daniel
Stewart's FP prop J B Borthwick, ironically a doctor, had damaged a
shoulder. He felt the pain when lifting his soup spoon.
It was quickly decided that Francis Blackadder of West would be his
replacement. ''There was only one problem,'' declared Duff. ''He had
eaten an awfully big meal.''
The bus driver taking the Scots to Twickenham lost his way in the
crowd and deposited the team at the wrong entrance. The players had to
thread their way through the dense throng to the dressing-room, hearing
many ribald comments about the parsimony of the SRU en route.
''I was just delighted when we got started,'' says the Scotland pack
leader. ''We had some forwards who could handle and I tried to lead by
example but Wilson Shaw was undoubtably our inspiration. He was
tremendously quick off the mark.''
Indeed it was he, the visiting fly-half, who created the opening try.
Shaw's cunning kick was pounced on by winger W N Renwick of London
Scottish who roared over for the score.
England hit back with two penalties by their full-back Parker but back
came the Scottish forwards to set up another try for Renwick. 6-6.
Then a move which involved Duff himself was completed when Charlie
Dick of Guy's Hospital sprinted in for the touchdown. Winger Unwin
brough England level with their second try before Shaw took another
decisive hand.
He sent the home defence the wrong way with a outrageous dummy,
side-stepped Parker and gave Scotland a three-point interval lead. After
the break England's fly-half Reynolds dropped a goal, worth four points
at that time, so the lead changed hands again. The goalkickers, who had
had a pretty lean afternoon, found their range; Crawford landed two
Scottish penalties, Parker one for the home side.
With three minutes left Shaw settled it. He accelerated through a gap
in the midfield and climaxed his second try with a spectacular dive.
They carried him off shoulder high.
How good were the 1938 side? ''I am biased, of course,'' replied
Laurie, ''but they were the best I ever saw. There was a nice balance in
the team.''
The war would split them up. Two of them, full-back George Roberts and
scrum-half Tom Dorward, were killed in action.
Having retired for the family meat business in Glasgow, Laurie does
not make too many internationals these days though his sight is much
improved following an operation to remove cataracts. He will be parked
in front of the television set this afternoon.
''I think they have a real chance,'' he told me. ''It may surprise you
but I thought there was the making of a good side when I watched them
lose against South Africa. They have improved every game since then.
''The Bath boys, Eric Peters and David Hilton, have been real finds.
Gavin Hastings has done a wonderful job as captain and Kenny Logan gives
the backline a buzz.
''Obviously the English forwards are very strong but if we keep them
running about the park we could pull it off. It's time our record was
broken.''
If it is, you can guarantee Laurie Duff will be invited to the
celebration party.

THE centuries-old independence of the Church of Scotland from the
state was dealt a devastating blow yesterday in the Court of Session.
The Kirk's constitution (the 1921 Church of Scotland Act) guarantees
it the right of being master in its own house, and having the right of
hiring and firing without resort to the civil courts.
However, Lord Osborne granted an interim interdict against Dumbarton
Presbytery which had decided to suspend a minister from his parish
pending what the Church called a trial by libel for alleged breaches of
undertakings in respect of work as an agent for Amway, a networking
sales organisation.
The freezing of the presbytery's actions has effectively made the
Kirk, which was not represented in court despite knowing about the
hearing, accountable in a civil court and has apparently breached the
principle which was often held out as one of its cornerstones.
The implications are far reaching and last night had thrown senior
Kirk figures into turmoil. Yet only last year the networking activities
of the Rev Tom Logan for Amway, which specialises in soap products and
in recruiting sales agents, were but a bubble in Kirk affairs.
After some complaints about networking as a form of selling, Mr Logan,
minister of Abbotsford Church in Clydebank, was interviewed by his
presbytery. He asked for permission to continue his activities but the
presbytery, by an overwhelming majority, ruled that networking was
incompatible with his work as a minister.
Mr Logan then petitioned the 1994 General Assembly which decided by
630 votes to 13 that the presbytery was right. Since then, further
complaints came to light and the presbytery decided to put Mr Logan on
trial under a Kirk Act of 1935.
This appoints a presbytery prosecutor, in this case the Rev John
Cairns, a Dumbarton minister and ex-lawyer who is convener of the
assembly judicial commission, which sits in private. After deciding
there was a case to be answered, the presbytery decided last Wednesday
to hold the trial on April 19 and meantime to suspend Mr Logan on full
pay until a decision was reached.
The Court of Session was told that a statement was to be issued
tomorrow from the pulpit of Abbotsford Parish Church at Clydebank by the
interim moderator as an intimation to the congregation.
At the end of the hearing, which lasted almost an hour, Lord Osborne
granted interim interdict suspending the decision issued on March 15 by
Dumbarton Presbytery and banning the issue of the proposed statement.
The judge said that he was persuaded there was a prima facie case for
suspension of the presbytery's decision. He said he took this view on
the basis of criticisms of procedures at an earlier stage as regards the
requirement that an accused person should be given a full opportunity of
defending himself.
The ''accused'', he said, should have been given the opportunity of
making appropriate submissions to the presbytery.
Mr Paul Arthurson, advocate for Mr Logan, had moved for interim
suspension of the decision on the grounds that it was in breach of
natural justice. He had argued that the decision had been taken in
circumstances where a full opportunity was not given to Mr Logan to put
his case.
Mr Logan is prevented from comment but his lawyer, Irvine solicitor Mr
Colin Cameron, who was a member of Mr Logan's previous congregation in
Irvine, was scathing about the case. Speaking after yesterday's Court of
Session interim interdict, he compared the presbytery procedures to
something out of the Mikado.
He said: ''Natural justice is so weighted against individuals in the
1935 Act and the Act does not fit in with the Declaration of Human
Rights in 1948 which guarantees independent tribunals, public hearings,
and impartial judges. In Church procedures, they are prosecution, judge,
jury, everything,'' he said.
Kirk officials were last night unable to explain why no Church of
Scotland lawyer had argued for its independence of jurisdiction at
yesterday's hearing.
The Kirk's principal clerk, the Very Rev James Weatherhead, described
the interim interdict as a ''flash in the pan''. He said that once the
Kirk's arguments had been heard the Kirk's right to administer its
doctrine and discipline separately from civil jurisdiction would surely
be affirmed.

THERE will be no hiding place for solicitors who fiddle legal aid, the
President of the Law Society of Scotland pledged yesterday.
Mr Kenneth Ross was highly critical of the failure of the Scottish
Legal Aid Board to detect and prevent cases of fraud and abuse.
He said that Slab, which is responsible for admininistering Legal Aid
in Scotland, had been reluctant to accept expert help from the Law
Society, the solicitors' governing body, to root out abuse of the
system.
Mr Ross was responding to recent comments by the chairman of Slab that
''wide boys'' and ''wise guys'' might be milking up to #600,000 from the
Scottish Legal Aid budget of #126m.
Speaking at the Law Society AGM at Gleneagles, Mr Ross pointed out
that legal aid cost just 44p per person per week in Scotland.
He said that it was thought of as an extravagance for others, but
essential for you if you are wrongly charged with a crime or needed to
fight for compensation for an injury.
It would be ungracious not to recognise that over the past five years
the Government's funding of legal aid in Scotland had more than doubled.
However, it would be a tragedy if the stewardship of Slab of these
public funds blunted the efforts of a well-meaning Government Minister
to boost or at least hold steady legal aid spending.
Mr Ross added: ''It would be disastrous if half-hearted husbandry
undermined the hard and conscientious work which the legal profession
provide for their clients, whether civil or criminal, on the basis of
legal aid renumeration now unchanged for three years.
''That is why it is a matter of acute concern that the Legal Aid Board
admits publicly in the press that it is failing to detect and prevent
alleged fraud and abuse of the legal aid scheme.''
Mr Ross said the Law Society had been pressing the board to improve
its auditing and accounts procedure and urged the board to accept the
society's help.
''Let me make it crystal clear that it is a matter of regret to the
council, and I would have thought some embarrassment to the board, that
it has taken so long to accept that the Law Society has a definite role
and a very real interest in rooting out any alleged abuse now.
''Let me reiterate that we will root out abuse. But it is the board
which has the information and the facts -- or at least it ought to.
''We will prosecute if facts so justify. But it is the board's
responsibility, with all the information at their disposal, to
investigate and make the results known to the Law Society.''

THE UK loses almost 60 million working days a year through back
problems, while up to 12 million of us suffer from breathing problems of
one kind or another . . . and the common denominator is often the bed,
writes WENDY JACK.
A remarkable 97% of GPs agree that a new bed could help alleviate back
problems, while an old one, with its legacy of bed mites -- and on
average 1lb of skin shed into it annually -- is recognised as
aggravating breathing problems.
A good bed that supports those sleeping on it in comfort is beyond
price in terms of what it contributes to our sleep and therefore our
lives.
But while few think much about spending quite sizeable sums monthly on
renting a TV or video, when it comes to beds we tend to scrimp. Yet if
#500 is spent on a new bed, that works out at just 13.5p a night over 10
years -- not really a high price to pay for true comfort and a real
quality of sleep.
A bed, as well as looking inviting, should be the best we can afford
and offer excellent support according to our own particular needs.
The one pictured below is Clarissa, from Reid Furniture, showrooms at
Uddingston and Straiton, Edinburgh. The base costs #499, with mattresses
available from #90 (standard double bed size).
Dawn Reid of Reid Furniture offers a few tips to keep in mind when
buying a new bed . . .
* Always lie down, in your normal sleeping position, on a selection of
beds for comparison. If it's a double bed, make sure you both lie on it
together.
* Buy the correct comfort and support -- not for firmness only.
* Think big -- larger beds are more comfortable.
* A bed is a mattress and base; don't consider them in isolation.
* You get what you pay for. Spend as much as you can afford.
* Discuss your individual requirements with the sales staff.

DETECTIVES believe the shotgun killing of a 34-year-old man outside an
Orange hall in Maryhill, Glasgow, and the wounding of his brother were
the outcome of a local feud.
The killing follows a recent incident in a local pub. Although the
brothers had been drinking in an Orange hall, police have ruled out a
sectarian motive.
Mr Allan McDonald, of Sandbank Street, Glasgow, was ambushed outside
Hughes Memorial Orange Halls. His brother, Ian, 29, of Wyndford Road,
Glasgow, is in the Western Infirmary with gunshot wounds to his
shoulder. His condition is said to be stable.
Detective Chief Inspector Jimmy Lindsay, of Maryhill CID, said: ''I
would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of Sandbank Crescent or
Sandbank Street near to the Orange halls and who may have seen anyone
loitering or acting suspiciously to contact me.''
The gunman is described as around 6ft, of slim and athletic build, and
wearing a dark or red-hooded top.

SCOTLAND'S most famous screen doctor yesterday went back to the scene
of a real-life hospital drama in which his grandfather played the lead
role.
David Rintoul, who plays Dr Finlay, recalled how the young airman who
was gassed when his plane crashed into a French field was brought back
to Edinburgh and nursed back to health at the Royal Victoria Hospital.
Mr Rintoul unveiled a plaque to commemorate the official opening of
the hospital's centenary celebrations and explained how he took his
maternal grandfather's name when he decided to become an actor.
The son of a geriatrician, Mr Rintoul paid tribute to the work of the
hospital which now cares for the elderly. It began as a chest hospital
and it was there that his grandfather was taken, suffering from gas
inhalation, during the First World War.
The actor moved from the medical to the political to warn against the
market forces eating away at the health service.
Yesterday's celebration to mark the 100th year of the hospital, which
has an international reputation for work in the development of medical
and psychiatric care of the elderly, also involved a man who played a
major role in its history.
Chest physician Professor Sir John Crofton, whose work was
instrumental in the elimination of tuberculosis in the fifties, unveiled
a plaque to the hospital's founder, Sir Robert Philip.

Spring may be sprung, but so are
most mattresses, and since March is
officially Bed Month we thought
we'd send Leila Aitken and
Wendy Jack to talk to the experts
and see how the land lies
REMEMBER the fairy story about the princess and the pea? How she was
so sensitive and delicate that she needed five feather beds piled on top
of one another so that she couldn't feel the pea under the bottom one?
Although as a child I remember wondering why she didn't have the
gumption to up-end the mattress and remove the offending pea, I now
understand exactly how she felt and can identify with her completely.
About six years ago I decided to break the bank and once and for all
get a comfortable bed, and bought the ultimate sleep system -- VI-Spring
Regal Supreme. That should do it, I thought. No more envying the
king-sized and sublimely comfortable beds of the Holiday Inn, and no
need any more to sneak a look at the name on the mattress of every
comfortable bed in other people's homes.
But, like the princess, two months later I bought a fleece to soften
my new mattress, and six months after that invested in a foam mattress
topper to give it a more yielding surface. And from then on, in truly
regal style, I have complained to all and sundry about my bed.
Until now. Recently I visited Martin and Frost in Edinburgh and their
bedding expert Alan Shephard put me right. Apparently there is a lot
more to buying a bed than reading the label on someone else's bed and
buying one the same. When you go to buy a bed what you need most of all
is advice, which he gave me.
''A few years ago, what was advertised as an 'orthopaedic' bed for bad
backs led to many people buying a bed far too hard for them. Nowadays
people are looking for a soft, luxurious feel, but still want support.
VI-Spring mattresses are made with springs in three tensions -- firm,
medium, and soft -- and the body weight determines the correct tension
to choose. Personal preference comes into it, of course, but a
lightweight person will find, as you have, that a spring with firm
tension has no yield and so is not supporting the curves of the body.''
Mr Shephard has a little demonstration box with three types of steel
spring encased in calico bags, termed ''pockets'', to prove his point.
The tension on the spring is determined by the thickness of the steel.
He also has a sample mattress cut through to show the individually
pocketed springs topped with layers of horsehair, lambswool, and cotton
felt, which is how a VI-Spring bed is constructed. The theory is that
because each spring has six coils (hence the Roman numeral VI in the
name), each spring will respond individually to the weight and body
movement. The higher the number of springs, the better the mattress
moulds to the body.
Hypnos beds are constructed on a similar principle and are those used
in many of the Holiday Inns. Martin and Frost also makes pocketed spring
beds to its own specification and these are less expensive than
VI-Spring because they use some synthetic materials whereas VI-Spring
uses only natural fibres.
Alan Shephard is a mine of information. Did you know, for example,
that the life span of a bed is 10 years? Mind you, I argued a bit on
that one -- mine have been in the family for ages. That 10 million
people are sleeping on a bed which is positively bad for them? That you
shed half a pint of water per night? That a Dunlopillo mattress, made of
latex, is firmer than a comparable pocketed spring one? That Dunlopillo
beds are non-allergenic and do not need to be turned, whereas a spring
mattress must be turned fortnightly for the first six months of its life
until the covering layers settle, and regularly thereafter?
There is a happy ending. I changed to a VI-Spring Herald Supreme
mattress with soft tension springs and hair upholstery. Bliss! Unlike
the princess, I wouldn't call the queen my auntie.

THE threatened Motorail and sleeper services to Scotland must be
retained in full until there has been full and formal consultation,
otherwise the future of the whole Scottish rail network will be under
threat, it was claimed yesterday.
This was the unanimous view of the Rail Users' Consultative Committee
for Scotland, which met in Perth.
The committee is now writing to the British Railways Board, demanding
that it observes this principle of consultation.
Committee chairman Mr Lawrence Kemp said yesterday: ''This has to be
done because the BR board is working to an agenda set by the director of
rail franchising, Mr Roger Salmon. We believe there is an unholy
alliance between them to make these things happen.
''My fear is not just for the sleeper services but for the whole
concept of consultation in the future if we don't get it right this
time. It is important that the staff as well as the rolling stock is
kept until this consulation is completed.''
Mr Kemp said that, if British Rail was allowed to cut services without
consultation, then Mr Salmon could reduce the specification and then say
he wasn't cutting services because they had already been withdrawn.
''I am worried that this is only the beginning. You get Government
Ministers saying 'Yes, you will get consultation', and then the British
Rail press release says they have decided to withdraw the services on
May 28 after consultation with the Department of Transport and the
Scottish Office.
''I really am very depressed about the future of the railways in this
country, the way this has been handled. It is a very bad start to the
Government's restructuring of the industry.''
The other members of the committee of 12 were equally angry: Mrs
Eleanor Brownlee, from Glasgow, said: ''There is no genuine
consultation, we are simply being asked to rubber-stamp this. I think we
all know that there are civil servants in Dr Mawhinney's department who
already know what the future of Scotland's rail services is, and all
they will be doing for the next few months and years is making sure that
happens.
''My other point is strictly personal, I have better things to do with
my time than to endorse the policies of what I now regard as a morally
bankrupt administration.''
Meanwhile, the rail regulator, Mr John Swift QC, was represented by Ms
Viv Johnson, who said press reports this week had misinterpreted Mr
Swift's view on the position of the threatened services. BR had been
entitled to withdraw them but that would not necessarily be the final
position.

<TEXT>
GLENEAGLES Hotel was the unlikely scene of a protest yesterday when
demonstrators lobbied the Law Society of Scotland to demand new laws to
protect clients from negligent solicitors.
The protest was led by Mr Iain McIntyre, a Paisley businessman, who is
pursuing a claim of #2.3m against solicitors.
The former builder claims his business, health, and personal life were
ruined by negligence on the part of his former lawyers.
Fifteen demonstrators from around Scotland waved placards and banners
outside the Perthshire hotel as delegates arrived for the society's
annual meeting.
Mr McIntyre said: ''The purpose of the protest was to raise public and
political awareness of the plight that many people find themselves in
when a solicitor is negligent.
''The present system is very much there to protect the solicitor.
Self-regulation does not work.''
Mr McIntyre added: ''I believe there is a need for a new independent
body with statutory powers to balance up the interests.
''Any new system has to be fair to the solicitor and the public. In
the current system people are being denied access to justice.''
Mr Kenneth Ross, president of the Law Society of Scotland, said the
society provided unparalleled consumer protection for clients of
solicitors.
He said the legal profession in Scotland was a world leader in
providing compulsory indemnity insurance and the existence of cover
under the Law Society's master policy was infinitely better for the
client and solicitor than the alternative of no cover at all.

MIKE CATT
(Bath)
Age 23, 5ft 10ins
13st 2lbs, 5 caps.
Comes into the England side via South Africa and the West Country,
courtesy of Bath. Claims that he had been paid while playing in South
Africa were investigated and Catt was exonerated. A converted fly-half
he might be troubled by some testing garryowens from Craig Chalmers and
Gavin Hastings.
14
TONY UNDERWOOD
(Leicester)
Age 26, 5ft 9ins, 13st 7lbs, 15 caps.
The younger of the Underwood brothers made his full England debut
against Canada in 1992 and scored his first international try against
the Springboks the same season. He was dropped for the first two matches
of the Five Nations' championship in 1993 but has been ever present
since.
13
WILL CARLING
(Harlequins) captain
Age 29, 5ft 11ins
14st 2lbs, 54 caps.
Will Carling has he led the side on 47 occasions, including a
world-record 36 victories. He missed out on the 1993 British Lions
captaincy to Gavin Hastings, playing in only the first Test on that
tour. He is England's most capped centre and since making his debut has
missed only two internationals.
12
JEREMY GUSCOTT
(Bath)
Age 29, 6ft 1in
13st 5lbs, 33 caps.
Jerry Guscott, one of the most effortless and effective runners on the
world stage, missed the entire Five Nations' campaign last season due to
injury. A part-time model, he was a 1989 British Lion in Australia and
was, again first choice centre on the tourists 1993 trip to New Zealand.
11
RORY UNDERWOOD
(Leicester)
Age 31, 5ft 9ins
13st 7lbs, 72 caps.
Rory Underwood, first capped in 1984, is England's most capped player
and record try scorer. An RAF pilot, he retired from international rugby
in 1992 but was coaxed back against South Africa in November that year.
He played in all three Tests with the Lions in 1989 and in New Zealand
in 1993.
10
ROB ANDREW
(Wasps)
Age 32, 5ft 9ins
12st 8lbs, 64 caps.
Rob Andrew, is a supremely dependable tactical and place-kicker, the
latter attribute never better demonstrated than by his 30 points from
six penalties and six conversions against Canada last December. The
world's most capped stand-off, he had a spell with Toulouse in France in
1990-91.
9
KYRAN BRACKEN
(Bristol)
Age 23, 5ft 11ins
12st 9lbs, 7 caps.
Kyran Bracken won his first cap against the All Blacks in 1993 when he
came on for the injured Dewi Morris and, for his trouble, was stamped on
by Jamie Joseph. Despite his Emerald Isle moniker he has come up through
the England ranks, having played for the under-16s, under-18s, under-21s
and England A.
1
JASON LEONARD
(Harlequins)
Age 26, 5ft 10ins
17st 2lbs, 37 caps.
Jason Leonard, who has played in England's last 37 tests, has made all
of his appearances with England in the loose-head prop slot but played
at tight-head in two of the Lions' Tests in New Zealand in 1993. Early
club rugby with Barking preceded a move to Saracens and then to his
current club.
2
BRIAN MOORE
(Harlequins)
Age 33, 5ft 9ins
14st 3lbs, 57 caps.
Brian Moore's combative style has made him the hooker that Scotsmen
love to hate. He made his international debut against Scotland at
Twickenham in 1987 and since then he has been regular first choice in
the English side. He is a former captain of Nottingham and England B and
captains 'Quins.
3
VICTOR UBOGU
(Bath)
Age 30, 5ft 9ins
16st 2lbs, 14 caps.
Victor Ubogu, born in Nigeria but resident in England for most of his
life, played in the 1988 Students' World Cup. He made his England debut
against Canada in 1992 but lost his place to Jeff Probyn after that
year's game against South Africa. He returned the following year and has
been ever-present since.
4
MARTIN JOHNSON
(Leicester)
Age 25, 6ft 7ins
17st 12lbs, 11 caps.
Martin Johnson was flown out to New Zealand for the British Lions in
1993 after Wade Dooley returned home. He made such an impression that he
played in the final two Tests. Last season he was ever-present in the
England side until concussion ruled him out on the summer tour to South
Africa.
5
MARTIN BAYFIELD
(Northampton)
Age 28, 6ft 10ins
18st 2lbs, 21 caps.
Martin Bayfield, the giant in an already telescopic England pack,
played in all three Tests for the 1993 Lions against the All Blacks. He
played in last season's games against Scotland and Ireland but was
dropped after defeat by the Irishmen. Regained his place on the summer
tour to South Africa.
6
TIM RODBER
(Northampton)
Age 25, 6ft 6ins
16st 7lbs, 13 caps.
Tim Rodber, an Army officer, made his England debut at No.8 against
Scotland in 1992 but subsequently lost out to Dean Richards and Ben
Clarke. He moved to blindside flanker, returning to face the All Blacks
at Twickenham. He missed last season's game against Scotland due to a
torn hamstring.
7
BEN CLARKE
(Bath)
Age 26, 6ft 5ins
17st, 16 caps.
Ben Clarke, the third member of England's towering but not
particularly fleet of foot back-row, made his England debut against
South Africa in 1992. Selected for 1993's Lions tour to New Zealand, he
played in all three Tests and was considered one of the successes of the
tour.
8
DEAN RICHARDS.
(Leicester)
Age 31, 6ft 4ins, 17st 8lbs, 41 caps.
Dean Richards' ungainly style, the legacy of having one leg slightly
shorter than the other, belies his influence. He made his England debut
away back in 1986. In and out of favour, he missed out with England in
1993. The Lions knew better, though, and he played in all three Tests in
New Zealand.
Jon Callard (Bath)
Phil de Glanville (Bath)
Dewi Morris (Orrell)
Steve Ojomoh (Bath)
Graham Rowntree (Leicester)

GAVIN HASTINGS
(Watsonians) captain
Age 33, 6ft 2ins
14st 8lbs, 55 caps.
Gavin Hastings, Scotland's most capped player, captains the Scots in a
major international for the fifteenth time. Scorer of 50 points in this
season's championship, he has provided a talismanic lead for a
rejuvenated Scotland this season. A survivor from the 1990 Grand Slam
victory over England.
14
CRAIG JOINER
(Melrose)
Age 20, 5ft 10ins
13st 10lbs, 6 caps.
Craig Joiner scored a try on his Five Nations' debut against Ireland
and today makes his seventh consecutive apearance in a Scotland shirt.
First capped on last summer's tour to Argentina. He has played for
Scotland at U18, U19 and U21 levels. A member of the 'A' team which
scored wins over South Africa and Italy.
13
GREGOR TOWNSEND
(Gala)
Age 21, 5ft 11ins
13st 8lbs, 11 caps.
Highlight of Gregor Townsend's season so far, with early promise
transformed into sparkling reality, was the break and mesmeric flip-pass
which led to Hastings's priceless try at Parc des Princes, where he also
scored a try. Townsend has also worn the Scotland shirt at inside centre
and fly-half.
12
SCOTT HASTINGS
(Watsonians)
Age 30, 6ft 1in
13st 4lbs, 52 caps.
Scott Hastings returned to Scotland colours against Wales a fortnight
ago after being dropped following the defeat by South Africa. The recall
came after injury to Ian Jardine in Paris but Hastings acquitted himself
well against the Welsh. Today he sets a new Scottish cap record for a
centre.
11
KENNY LOGAN
(Stirling County)
Age 22, 6ft 1in
13st 8lbs, 14 caps.
Kenny Logan, long overdue a first Five Nations' try for Scotland, has
set this season alight with some barnstorming runs. He was Stirling
County's first cap, against Australia in 1992. Has represented Scotland
at U-18, U-19 and U-21 levels and thrice for Scotland A. His run led to
Eric Peters' try against Wales.
10
CRAIG CHALMERS
(Melrose)
Age 26, 5ft 10ins
13st 6lbs, 40 caps.
Craig Chalmers' play this season has generally been out of the top
drawer. Against Wales his tactical kicking was of a seriously testing
nature and, particularly against the French in Paris, his cover tackling
has been immense. He was a British Lion in Australia in 1989 when he
played in the first Test.
9
BRYAN REDPATH
(Melrose)
Age 23, 5ft 7ins
10st 10lbs, 9 caps.
Bryan Redpath, who won his first two caps as a replacement (against NZ
and England) has now made the number nine shirt his own. He made his
first-choice debut against France in 1994 and forms an all-Melrose
half-back partnership with Craig Chalmers and has played five times for
Scotland 'A'.
1
DAVID HILTON
(Bath)
Age 24, 5ft 10ins
16st 4lbs, 4 caps.
David Hilton's try against Wales a fortnight ago crowned a dream
season for the Bristol butcher, who came to the notice of the Scottish
selectors via the Scottish Exiles and owes his selection to an
Edinburgh-born grandfather. He was a member of the Scotland 'A' sides
which beat South Africa and Italy.
2
KENNY MILNE
(Heriot's FP)
Age 33, 6ft, 15st 12lbs, 35 caps.
Kenny Milne, the veteran of the pack who has played with renewed
vigour this season, is the youngest of three brothers to have played in
the Scotland front row. He was Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam hooker and
toured with the 1993 British Lions in New Zealand, playing in the first
Test.
3
PETER WRIGHT
(Boroughmuir)
Age 27, 6ft
17st 2lbs, 10 caps.
Peter Wright, the Bonnyrig blacksmith equally at home in the tight or
the loose, has been one of Scotland's great success stories this season.
His devastating running off ruck and maul has been a feature of the
Boroughmuir and Scotland game-plans. He was a British Lion in New
Zealand in 1993.
4
DODDIE WEIR
(Melrose)
Age 24, 6ft 6ins, 16st 2lbs, 26 caps.
Doddie Weir has regained his hunger for the game and returned against
Wales a fortnight ago because of injury to Damian Cronin. He has played
16 times a lock and ten times a No.8 which is his preferred position.
His height will be a much needed requirement against England's lineout.
5
STEWART CAMPBELL
(Dundee HSFP)
Age 22, 6ft 6ins, 16st 8lbs, 4 caps.
Stewart Campbell has performed the ''workhorse'' duties in the
Scotland pack with vim and vigour since he made his debut against Canada
in January. In particular his fielding of enemy restarts has been
invariably the starting point for a counter-attack. He has played three
times for Scotland 'A'.
6
ROB WAINWRIGHT
(West Hartlepool)
Age 29, 6ft 4ins, 15st 4lbs, 11 caps.
Rob Wainwright, an Army doctor, will be looking for a repeat of the
try he scored against England at Murrayfield last season, although . In
other respects, with a broken jaw curtailing his involvement, he will be
seeking better Calcutta Cup fortune today. Prefers to play at No.8 but
his versatility has seen him enlisted as international flanker, No.8 and
as a replacement lock.
7
IAIN MORRISON
(London Scottish)
Age 32, 6ft 1in, 15st 1llbs, 10 caps.
Iain Morrison made international debut in 1992. He has played for
London Scottish since 1985 and was a member of their Middlesex winning
seven in 1991. He returned to the Scottish side against South Africa
after breaking a leg in the tousy encounter with Wales in Cardiff last
season.
8
ERIC PETERS
(Bath)
Age 26, 6ft 5ins, 16st 10lbs, 4 caps.
Eric Peters, like Bath team-mate Dave Hilton, had a try against Wales
a fortnight ago. It was a spectacular affair, launched by Ken Logan but
finished off with some intelligent backing up by the Bath chartered
surveyor. He was born in Glasgow and made an impressive debut against
Canada
Cameron Glasgow (Heriot's FP)
Graham Shiel (Melrose)
Derrick Patterson (West Hartlepool)

INDEPENDENCE is a low priority among those who say they will vote for
the Scottish National Party in the Perth and Kinross by-election,
according to The Herald's System Three poll in the constituency.
The low figure would suggest that many potential SNP voters are using
the party as a protest vote against the Government.
Mr John Godfrey, the Conservative candidate in the election, said the
poll suggested that the Nationalist's independence stance was not a
priority for most people in Perth and Kinross.
The Herald reported yesterday that the System Three poll showed that
the SNP had taken a massive lead in the constituency and was on course
for a by-election victory.
Those polled were also asked the main issues likely to influence them
in their choice of party.
The NHS led with 31%, then unemployment and jobs with 27%, education
20%, pensions and the elderly 17%, law and order 15%, both the economy
and council tax 14%, and independence-devolution 11%. Among SNP voters,
independence-devolution was mentioned by only 18%.
A spokesman for the SNP said it was wrong to simply look at
independence in isolation. The health service and jobs, for example,
could be mentioned by people who believe the party's policy of
independence in Europe best matched their aspirations in these areas.
The main issues of health, unemployment, and education mirror those
mentioned in a national survey earlier this year. However, the NHS was
mentioned the most in Perth and Kinross, whereas in the national survey
unemployment was the main concern.
This may be due to the recent high profile of health issues, which
include a young girl being denied cancer treatment, nurses' pay, and the
rise in prescription charges.
It was perhaps surprising that pensions and matters relating to the
elderly were of more concern than topics such as law and order and the
economy. Indeed, it was the main issue among the over 55s.

ANTHONY TROON's activity calendar for the man
who calls a spade an instrument of torture
WHEN I caught sight of him-next-door and his wife at it again, my
heart sank. They were applying themselves to the business with such
energy, such enthusiasm. I could even hear them grunting. Didn't they
ever give up? ''Blast you!'' I whispered, so they couldn't hear.
''You're embarrassing me.'' Then I drew the net curtains together again
and sulked.
Life, I mused, is so easy for people like them-next-door. It comes up
roses every time. Or leeks, or cabbages, or sweet peas or
chrysanthemums. They are gardeners. They dig, therefore they are. We,
who have gardens but hate gardening, lack the back-up and the advice.
For us there is no Non-Gardeners' Question Time, no garden-loathing
centre. There is no newspaper column headed The Week's Sloth. We have to
find our own way. This is why, in a spirit of angry retribution, I have
compiled this short guide entitled:
A Year's Guilt in the Garden
* March: Well-rotted manure will have been ordered for forking into
herbaceous borders and vegetable patches. This is the time to complain
about it. If your dogs happen to be labradors, they will find your
neighbour's crap-pile absolutely irresistible, eating it in great
quantities and suffering halitosis. Then you have to think about the
effect upon local house values. It's a month for sowing discord.
* April: If you peep through the nylon drapes this month you will see
them-next-door going through some appalling rituals. ''Hardening up,''
for example, and ''planting out''. This involves much bending and
gasping. So for you, it's the month to retrieve the garden table and
chairs from the shed and to scrape off the mildew, with loud snickering
and nonchalant humming.
* May: You will find it harder this month to avert your eyes from
them-next-door. They will be staking out herbaceous and other flowering
plants and, I kid you not, hardening-off vegetable marrows. I always
feel that this should be done in privacy, or after dark. The other point
is that their potatoes are starting to show and, as they hoe diligently
between the rows, they will have that self-satisfied expression on their
faces that gets worse as the sunshine does its deadly work.
* June: By now, your own patch will be a mass of growing things, none
of which you can actually recall planting. This is the thrill of the
wild garden. What's it to be this year? Bindweed, with its pretty, pink
flowers, will be showing well all over the place and, if you are lucky,
judiciously-placed clumps of nettles and dandelion will give variety in
colour and texture. The yellow coltsfoot will have lost its flowers by
now, and will be presenting foot-long leaves with an attractive down on
the underside. Your neighbours might appreciate the bouquet of these
leaves: if they don't happen to be around while you harvest them, just
toss a clump over the fence. They're bound to notice.
* July, August, September: Your neighbours' garden will be a riot of
carefully-arranged colour with perfectly-manicured lawns. They will sit
on deckchairs in the middle of this, awaiting plaudits from the passing
crowd. So for you, it's the time to burn rubbish when the wind is
blowing towards them-next-door. Plastic trays from old television
dinners, and bald car tyres, are particularly recommended at this time.
* October, November, December, January, February: At last the year
enters its most fruitful period. Nothing very much grows. Certainly, you
might catch a glimpse of him-next-door turning over his vegetable patch.
And with a bit of luck, it will snow heavily. At last, without a drop of
perspiration shed, your garden will look exactly like theirs . . .

KINDERGARTEN would be a better name for Oakgrove Primary, along at St
George's Cross. The children seem to delight in making things grow,
writes Stewart Fraser.
It all started about four years ago, says head teacher Angela
MacMillan.
''We have an outdoor nature garden,'' says 11-year-old Steven Hendren.
''There's a pond and a marsh and a vegetable patch.''
''We sow seeds for vegetables and flowers and things,'' adds Jennifer
McLardy, another 11 year old.
Flowers include daffodils, sweet peas, daisies, and tulips. There's
also a sensory garden. It means having things you can touch, smell,
taste, see, or hear, the youngsters point out.
''You can hear the birds that come in,'' says Steven. ''They sing to
us,'' adds Jennifer.
Managing to find a pause in the conversation, Mrs MacMillan explains
that the school has been helped by the Prince's Trust in Maryhill in
digging out the ground.
''We found an old tenement,'' Steven volunteers. ''The foundation,''
Jennifer explains. ''It was built in 1858,'' continues Steven. The
double act went on to explain how the schol enlisted the help of
students at the School of Architecture and the School of Art to solve
the tenement mystery.
The children explain that anyone can come and enjoy the gardens.
There's a ramp to let in people with wheelchairs. There are pebbles to
let blind people know where they are.
''There's talk of an artist in residence,'' says Mrs MacMillan. ''That
could mean a sculpture for the garden. That would be a surprise. It just
shows what you can do when you put your mind to it.''

PRESIDENT Clinton finally bowed to British pressure yesterday and
called on the IRA to surrender its arms.
He said Sinn Fein should take ''the next step'' to peace by starting
the process of decommissioning weapons.
At a St Patrick's Day meeting in Washington with Irish premier John
Bruton, Mr Clinton said the prospects for peace in Northern Ireland were
now better than for a generation.
British Ministers remain furious that he ignored their advice and
invited Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams to Washington for a visit that
was last night due to culminate in a handshake with the President.
Former Northern Ireland Minister Michael Mates accused the President
of acting ''like a third-rate party politician''.
Mr Mates -- who went to the US last year to act as the unofficial
voice of the British Government during a visit by Mr Adams -- said:
''What President Clinton has done is play naked politics with the Irish
question.''
Yesterday, Mr Adams and the Government took opposite lines on a claim
by the Sinn Fein leader that his party and British Ministers will hold
talks ''sooner rather than later''.
A Northern Ireland Office spokesman insisted: ''It has not been
decided whether it is appropriate for Ministers to join exploratory
dialogue.''
Mr Clinton, meanwhile, is intent on pushing the peace process along --
when he and Mr Adams met briefly at a Washington ceremony on Thursday
night, the President reportedly punched the air and said: ''This is
going to work.''
Mr Major, who in anger has held off contacts for a week with the White
House, has fired off a letter calling on Mr Clinton to pile pressure on
Mr Adams for progress on the surrender of IRA arms.
Mr Clinton was reported to have agreed to the demand in a return
letter on Tuesday -- and yesterday he seemed to be as good as his word.
''To those who have laid down their arms, I ask you now to take the
next step and begin to seriously discuss getting rid of these weapons so
they can never be used again and violence will never again return to the
land,'' he said.
The President said the decommissioning of weapons could not come soon
enough, and he urged all sides to look on the British and Irish
framework document as a landmark step in the move towards a settlement.
He welcomed Sinn Fein's statement reiterating its pledge to include
the weapons issue in talks with the British Government, saying this had
influenced his decision to grant Mr Adams a visa to visit the US.
President Clinton said the US had a very deep and powerful relationshp
with Britain. They may differ from time to time about specific acts each
would take, but their goals were the same.
He recognised the risk Mr Major had taken in the peace process -- and
disclosed that he hoped to have talks with him in the next couple of
days.
The President said his administration had also reached out to
Unionists. ''The important thing to me is to keep pushing this process,
to keep it going. I have every confidence that will occur,'' he said.
Prospects for peace in Northern Ireland were brighter now than they
had been ''in a generation'', he said.
Mr Bruton praised the President's role and the risks he was prepared
to take to move the process forward.
Bringing peace to Ireland would be one of the President's greatest
personal achievements, said the Republic's Prime Minister.
He told the President: ''The willingness you have shown to take risks
and do things many of us might have thought were foolhardy, like
granting a visa to Gerry Adams, has proven to be right.
''You made the right decisions. The results are there for all of us to
see, because you gave that organisation a sense of confidence in itself
and a glimpse of the political dividend that was there for them by
pursuing a peaceful rather than a violent track.''
He also believed there were ''serious moves'' by both sides for Sinn
Fein to have ministerial contact.
* The IRA denied any involvement with a bomb discovered in a gym bag
at a Texas HomeCare store in the Ulster border town of Newry on Thursday
evening. It partly exploded while it was being defused by a robot,
police said, but no-one was hurt.
In Washington last night, Mr Bruton accused republican dissidents
trying to wreck the peace process of planting the bomb.

A COUNCILLOR in West Lothian was under pressure last night to resign
after his council expenses claim from his home in England to the
district totalled nearly #17,000.
Councillor Terry Coleman, Labour representative for the Howden ward in
Livingston, made the claims for travelling to and from his home in South
Shields on Tyneside to West Lothian over a period of nearly a year.
The average payment to other councillors over the same period is
believed to be around #1200. The next highest expenses claim behind Mr
Coleman was entered by Councillor David King, from East Calder, who
claimed a total of #5616.
A breakdown of Mr Coleman's expenses bill shows he claimed a total of
#10,457 from April last year. He was also entitled to back payments of
#6115 after new legislation increased expenses payments.
Each journey to and from his home in South Shields will bring in
around #98 based on a mileage rate of around 42p.
The council's SNP convener, Councillor Jimmy McGinley, said Mr
Coleman, who has been an elected representative for 15 years, should
resign. He described the expenses bill as ''an extraordinary
extravaganza''.
Mr McGinley said: ''This expenditure alone represents 39p on the
council tax for just one councillor's claim. This is a luxury we cannot
afford and it brings the council into disrepute. He must reconsider his
position.''
SNP group leader Peter Johnston said: ''According to calculations,
Councillor Coleman must travel around four times a week and do around
40,000 miles a year. I cannot accept that the people of West Lothian
should have to bear the brunt of the expenses claim.''
Isobel Brydie, an Independent Conservative on West Lothian District
Council, said she was amazed at Mr Coleman's claims: ''My eyes nearly
jumped out of their sockets when I saw what he had claimed. I find it
absolutely appalling. There must be a full inquiry.''
Mr Coleman moved to South Shields last year because of ''personal
circumstances''. During his early years on the council, he was a
high-profile councillor working with Livingston Development Corporation
on a number of initatives and had a leading role on the licensing board.
He is now working as a self-employed agent for the licensed trade.
Mr Coleman last night was unavailable for comment but has indicated he
will continue as a councillor. He has said that because of his personal
circumstances he had to move to Tyneside and had told the council chief
executive and the convener about his situation.
It has also been suggested he is considering getting a flat in
Livingston to ease the strain of travelling.
Mr Joe Thomson, deputy leader of the Labour group, said he had no idea
of Mr Coleman's expenses claims and had not talked to him about it.
A district council spokesman confirmed the figures and said they were
looking to see how much tax Mr Coleman would have to pay on the expenses
claims.

SHE is a survivor, the greatest Hollywood star of her generation, a
woman whose life has been the proverbial roller-coaster in which triumph
was followed by disaster, tragedy by success, ridicule by acclaim, the
Betty Ford Clinic by rehabilitation.
There were better actresses among her peers, but Elizabeth Taylor was
the one who came top of the heap. A collector of husbands -- she had
nine marriages, although only eight husbands because she married Richard
Burton twice -- and jewels, she was also a setter of trends.
Taylor as Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof sitting on that brass
bedstead in her slip is one of the cinema's definitive images, although
not the only one to endure. They range from the 18-year-old Taylor,
dewy-eyed, virginal, and modest in white lace in Father of the Bride,
through the definitively regal Cleopatra (pictured), to the raddled,
overweight, blowsy Taylor as the combative Martha in Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf.
Although her stardom is long over -- her last film of note was
probably Reflections in a Golden Eye made in 1967, and her attempt to
conquer the theatre as Regina in Little Foxes in 1981 proved a disaster
-- the powerful fascination she exerts remains undamaged. She has found
a cause, that of Aids, and has campaigned endlessly and bravely for it.
At times she has verged on the ridiculous but like the Sondheim lady
she can truly say ''I'm still here''. Donald Spoto's biography (Little
Brown, #17.50) is little more than a swift scan through the pages of a
complicated life. Taylor summed it up thus -- ''Everything was handed to
me -- looks, fame, wealth, honour, love. I rarely had to fight for
anything. But I've paid for that luck with disasters -- the deaths of
friends, terrible illnesses, destructive addictions, broken marriages.
All things considered, I'm damned lucky to be alive.''

THE SNP was again embroiled in controversy over the Perth and Kinross
by-election last night after its candidate, advocate Roseanna
Cunningham, won a court order banning Scottish Watch from distributing
anti-English leaflets during her campaign.
Ms Cunningham petitioned the Court of Session in Edinburgh seeking
interim interdict against Mr Iain Sutherland of Kirk Cottage, Tynron,
Dumfriesshire, a senior office-bearer of Scottish Watch.
However, Mr Sutherland, secretary of Scottish Watch, declared last
night: ''We consider this a complete over-reaction on behalf of the SNP.
''They've take a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It reflects badly on
their willingness to engage in democratic debate with us and I expect
the electorate may perceive that.''
He added that Scottish Watch was considering issuing a possible
challenge to the interdict.
Mr Mungo Bovey, advocate for Ms Cunningham, told the court that a
number of leaflets had been distributed in Perth bearing anti-English
sentiments. He said one was headed ''Don't Vote for an English Banker''.
Others bore the message ''Scottish Watch Says Vote Cunningham SNP'' and
''Put Scotland First; Vote SNP, Join Scottish Watch.''
He said: ''She does not wish to be associated in any way with
anti-English sentiments for which the Scottish Watch organisation are
primarily known.''
Mr Bovey added that the Scottish Watch leaflets bearing the
anti-English comments were distributed without Ms Cunningham's consent.
She was entitled to have interdict granted.
The leaflets appeared to link Ms Cunningham to the organisation.
Neither she nor her election agent had authorised Mr Sutherland or
anyone else connected with Scottish Watch to incur any expense in
connection with the election.
Mr Sutherland had issued a press statement on behalf of Scottish
Watch. It states that Scottish Watch intended to campaign in the
by-election in support ''of a suitable Scottish Nationalist'' and
against one of the other declared candidates.
On March 9, 12, and 15, leaflets at the centre of the complaint were
distributed in various parts of Perth without Ms Cunningham or her
election agent's authorisation.
Mr Bovey said Ms Cunningham feared the ''unwanted association''
between her and Scottish Watch might damage her reputation and prospects
of election because of the anti-English sentiments in the leaflets.
These were at variance with Ms Cunningham's views and that of her party.
Neither Mr Sutherland nor Scottish Watch was legally represented at
the hearing.
Lord Cullen granted an order banning the anti-English leaflets or
leaflets disparaging another candidate from being distributed without Ms
Cunningham's consent or SNP authorisation during her campaign in Perth
and Kinross constituency. Ms Cunningham was not in court during the
hearing.
Earlier, at a press conference in Perth, the SNP attacked the racist
activities of anti-English political groups and said Scottish Watch in
particular had become a nasty irrelevance in the Perth and Kinross
by-election.
However, Mr Sutherland told The Herald that his organisation had been
misunderstood and said it also repudiated racism, violence, and the
tactics of more extreme Scottish nationalist organisations.
The SNP has now enlisted the support of New Scots for Independence --
a group of foreign-born Scots Nationalists -- in its most scathing
attack yet on Scottish Watch, Settler Watch, and the Scottish National
Liberation Army (SNLA).
English-born Dot Jessiman, the convener of New Scots, said
independence was ''a natural state for a nation'' and should not be
confused with arguments over ethnic background.
She said the members of her organisation -- which includes those of
Irish, American, French, and German origin -- had found Scotland a
welcoming home and would be working hard in the by-election to support
Ms Cunningham.
Yorkshireman Mr David Newhouse, who is standing as an SNP candidate in
the elections for the new unitary authority in Perthshire and Kinross,
added: ''I know Scotland and the Scottish people far better than any
fringe crackpots and I am delighted that New Scots is backing Roseanna
Cunningham.''
Mr Mike Russell, the chief executive of the SNP, who is of English
descent, said Scottish Watch was a nasty irrelevance, while the racist
policies and tactics of the extreme nationalist fringe were totally
repudiated by his party.
He welcomed the support of New Scots and said the SNP made ''no
judgment about those who want to help Scotland, and any unpleasant
lunatic fringe that tries to do so quickly finds itself outside the
party and floundering in the distant gutters of politics.''
He added: ''Democracy has no place for such people, as was shown in
the European elections where a candidate associated with Scottish Watch
views polled 600 votes in the North-east of Scotland out of an
electorate of nearly 600,000.''
He said the SNP's own constitution categorically stated that ''all
forms of ethnic discrimination were divisive and unacceptable''.
Ms Cunningham said: ''The SNP is a wide, inclusive, and welcoming
party. I do not want, and will not accept, support from any individual
or organisation who is persuaded by racially motivated, salacious, and
divisive propaganda.
She said that, if Scottish Watch was serious about the Perth and
Kinross by-election, the answer was for it to put up a candidate. ''But
not a single person amongst them is willing to stand up and be
counted.''
However, Mr Sutherland told The Herald that his party had been
misunderstood and allegations of racism were ridiculous. He said
Scottish Watch repudiated the tactics of Settler Watch, didn't believe
in a fascist leadership and had spoken out against violence and
intimidation of all sorts. ''Scottish Watch has already gone on record
to repudiate all forms of racism. In fact, our policy is in favour of a
Bill of Rights to guarantee the rights of all minorities in Scotland,
including English minorities,'' he said.
Mr Sutherland added that the group would not be diverted from
campaigning for Scottish Nationalism in the forthcoming by- election.
He declared: ''The SNP is obviously annoyed because it can't control
us. But a third of our members are also members of the SNP. We are the
real Scottish Nationalists and proud of it.''

A RIVER TOWN
Thomas Keneally
Sceptre, #15.99
AFTER Schindler's Ark (filmed with acclaim as Schindler's List),
Thomas Keneally's subsequent books are almost bound to seem an
anti-climax. He tackles inevitable comparisons with characteristic brio.
His latest oeuvre, A River Town, shuns the extremes of evil and humanity
to offer a slice of antipodean life circa 1900.
Tim Shea is his initially unpromising central character, a
store-keeper in the raw New South Wales town of Kempsey on the Macleay
River. The shopkeeper, purveyor of flour and condensed milk and sago, as
hero? Why not? -- though Napoleon sneered.
Tim, however, is not of solid Anglo-Saxon stock, the kind of new
Australian who can be relied to support Queen and Empire in the struggle
against the Boers or sign patriotic pledges at public meetings. His
origins are in County Cork. An uncle had Fenian connections. But, in
spite of a certain roughness in his public and interior discourse, he is
no wild colonial boy either. A thoughtful, literate man, whose peasant
father revels in his own command of language, Tim possesses a Chambers
Encylopaedia and pores over back issues of the London Illustrated News
in spare moments.
In this new world, whose landscapes and possibilities and disasters
seem on a more heroic scale than that of the old, the Irish immigrant of
independent mind must tread carefully -- just about tolerated,
assimilated, but always capable of being cast as outsider. Tim has,
unwillingly, an acolyte, the Muslim hawker and horseman, Bandy Habash.
This young man of flowery English and refined sensibilities is even more
of an outsider. The fates of the two are entangled throughout the plot,
from the opening scene of horror, when they have to deal with a messy
fatal accident.
Horrors lie as a subtext to Tim's life. He is haunted by the pickled
head of a dead girl which is being touted round the countyside by the
local constabulary. Living women beset him too: his beloved little
vulgarian wife and her succession of immigrant sisters; the orphaned
Lucy whose mute reproaches about the limits of his concern he can hardly
bear; Mother Imelda who preys/prays on his Catholic generosity; and the
Tennyson-spouting Mrs Malcolm, his ideal woman.
Forced into what he feels to be the ridiculous position of local hero
(others are manipulating him for their own ends), Tim finds himself,
just as unfairly, falling into the opposite situation. Financial and
personal tribulations of Job-like proportions threaten to engulf him.
Some resolution is offered by the outbreak of bubonic plague in Kempsey.
His stay in the isolation hospital is a sort of purgatory from which he
emerges to resume life and commerce on the other side of the river. The
Macleay is here perhaps a kind of symbolic Styx.
In spite of an occasional, odd, gaucheness, this is writing of great
vigour and perception, whether in its evocation of the raw, vital
colonial world with its mixture of traditions and races, or in its
exploration of the interior world of a vulnerable man of imagination and
conscience. The landscapes of New South Wales -- purple mountains
swimming in the heat and menaced by bush fires, the snaking green river
as capable of random diversion as any wilful human, the Pacific
seascapes beyond the river bar -- will haunt this reader's imagination.
Just as Tim felt his family history continuing in this new, extreme
location, so I feel something of my own history filled in, for my
Ayrshire grandmother's family took this same one-way passage to northern
New South Wales in the very era Keneally describes.
A River Town could also be viewed as a timely addition to the
millennial case for a republican Australia. The most eloquent
anti-imperialist arguments are rehearsed by Tim's journalist friend, the
mischievous Offhand. And besides, the vitality and cockiness of the
characters make old-world perspectives, shibboleths, seem somehow
ridiculous even a century ago.

Arthur Frommer has been advising the world on travel since he found
himself in Europe as a GI. As William Russell discovers, his enthusiasm
for his subject has not faded
ARTHUR Frommer talks nineteen to the dozen. The man has been selling
himself and travel advice for so long through his guidebooks and on
innumerable American radio and television programmes that he knows all
the answers. An interview is more of an audience than a
question-and-answer session, and if a question does not suit he
misunderstands it. I wondered why Frommer on South America was so
selective, meaning that it concentrates almost entirely on the capital
cities. He took me as meaning that his guides were selective in the
sense of being choosy about what they recommend. The flow was such that
I never got back to the question.
The guidebook industry has mushroomed since Frommer revolutionised it
in 1957 with the publication of Europe on Five Dollars a Day. Most
present-day budget travellers, those who wish to travel as cheaply as is
humanly possible, or those who simply don't want to waste money, are
well catered for with guides, and most are too young to appreciate the
sensation Frommer's book caused. In a world just emerging from austerity
it brought about a revolution in the travelling habits of both Americans
and Europeans. It is difficult to think of any guidebook today which has
so influenced a generation.
Frommer is no longer out on his own. From having broken new ground he
has become the doyen of his profession. He is a small, dapper,
grey-haired man who looks like a lawyer -- hardly surprising since he is
one, a member of the New York bar. After he graduated from Yale
University Law School, he served in US Army Intelligence in Europe in
the late 1950s. His experience of making the most of his travel chances
as a relatively impecunious GI inspired him to write a guidebook for his
fellow servicemen, The GI's Guide to Travelling in Europe, telling where
they could find the cheapest places to stay, to eat in, and how to get
there. It was a success.
On his discharge from the army he returned to the law, but the book,
turned into that first five-dollars-a-day tome, changed his life. It
also changed the lives of many Americans, since it showed the middle
earners they too could afford to visit Europe. Paree or Venezia were not
necessarily the preserve of the elite. ''The book caused an explosion,''
he said. ''Hundreds of thousands of people came over to Europe with it
in their arms.'' If young Americans used it, so did the even more
impecunious Europeans. In 1959, the first time I visited Italy, it was
possible to live in Venice on under #3 a day. Times have changed.
Frommer now advises how to do Europe on 50 dollars a day, a claim about
which I expressed my doubts. He insisted it was possible.
What does he look for in a guidebook, I wondered. He started to answer
the question, and then moved on to explaining what his guides provided
that was different from everybody else. ''I look for a certain maturity
and wisdom in the writer as to what that book can do for people,'' he
said. ''I don't like him just to set out addresses of hotels, I want to
have some description of where a place is, to know how to get there. I
don't want idiosyncratic choices of little restaurants that appeal to
the writer. The chances are they will no longer be there by the time I
use the guide. I want well-established reliable places, the sort which
have been in business for two decades and will continue to be in
business. That is one of the problem with the student guides. The
student writer goes somewhere once. Our writers have been there time and
time again.
''I don't want the chief emphasis in a guide to be on hotels or
restaurants or shopping. Some guides are 90% lodgings and food. I want
something about why I have come to this country. We make a great effort
to ferret out things other than the traditional. I don't want it just to
be all about sightseeing. You can just as easily look at a picture-book
if all you go to see in Paris is the Eiffel Tower. I want to help people
meet people, to get to the grassroots, to exchange ideas.''
What had he in mind? ''I don't know any other guide that tells people
how to get to the centre for alternative technology at Machynlleth in
Wales,'' he said. ''It is a utopian ecological community, totally
self-sustaining, which actively encourages visitors -- they get some
50,000 a year. In Scotland, we tell people about the Findhorn
Association, one of the great New Age centres. In London, we tell people
where they can find the bulletin board at London University which sets
out all sorts of lectures, seminars and events they can attend, often
for free.
''We work very hard to keep our guides factually precise and up to
date. A lot of guides are deliberately designed to have a shelf life of
20 years. We deliberately make our books obsolescent. We put the date on
the cover: Frommer's Paris 1994. We engage in a giant exercise to check
every price we give. I don't like to be told that somewhere charges #18
a night and then find they charge more. They come out.''
He has over 100 writers on his staff, backed up by editors and
fact-checkers, but still finds time to pen guides himself. He believes a
guide should have the author's name on it, not be compiled by committee,
and Frommer writers are allowed to express their dislikes. The author of
Frommer's Mexico hates Mexican food and has provided information on how
to find more digestible fare.
The latest guide he has written is to Branson, Missouri, apparently
the third most popular destination in the United States, attracting some
six million visitors a year. What was it, I asked? ''The centre of
country music. I lived there for two months to do the book,'' he said.
Arthur Frommer leads a peripatetic life. He said he could be in
Thailand on Thursday morning, but back home in New York at the weekend.
Technology helped. He travelled with his laptop. As for unusual advice,
it was Frommer who told me where to find a cockfight in Lima, a
grassroots experience with a vengeance.

POLITICS never made me cry before (or after) the 1983 General
Election. I hadn't really expected Michael Foot to win, of course, but I
had a bunch of right-thinking (ie left-thinking) pals around for beer,
sandwiches, and election results in hopes of something to celebrate.
Faced with the choice between a suburban Dalek and a decent old josser
who'd written more books than Thatcher had read, I thought the
electorate would, despite the polls, do something approaching the right
thing.
Well, around three in the morning, we all sang The Red Flag, and then
I walked around the block and howled. Michael Foot handled the debacle
with more dignity, as Mervyn Jones recalls in his superb biography
Michael Foot (Gollancz, #9.95), the heartwarming story of a life spent
shouting against the wind on behalf of the ill-done-to of Britain and
the world. Packed with gossip and revealing political anecdotes, this
life of the best Prime Minister we never had will leave most socialists
and many Tories full of admiration for a diehard idealist who has never
given up on that great, sad old cause, a better world.
America produces short-story writers these days like Detroit used to
produce Fords, and the cream of the current crop is Thom Jones, whose
debut collection The Pugilist At Rest (Faber, #5.99) explores the world
of men (mostly) with a power and integrity that recalls the early
Hemingway. Drawing variously upon his own experiences as a US Marine, a
professional boxer, and a working stiff trying to make a life, Jones's
stories punch their full weight in four-ounce gloves but never suffer
from the emotional crudeness that mars so many other writers in the same
tough-but-tender macho style. Nor does he lack insight into other kinds
of lives: the best story is not about Vietnam or the prize-fight ring,
but a moving account of terminal illness written from the point of view
of a middle-aged woman dying of cancer. Angry but achingly human,
Jones's passion for life overcomes all accusations of his being
overdosed on testosterone.
Schindler's Ark Booker-winner Thomas Keneally's Jacko The Great
Intruder (Sceptre, #5.99) is a rough and ribald satire on American
infotainment television and the way it cuts human life and suffering
down to size. Jacko Emptor is a professional Australian, bursting with
mateship and bonhomie, who presents a live New York TV show that invades
ordinary people's homes and turns their problems into passing
entertainment for the gawping herd; but when he becomes involved in the
televised search for a missing woman, he gets nutted by reality and
discovers a new perspective on what he's doing and what it's for. But
America isn't his only target; like every good satirist, Keneally knows
that uncharity must begin at home -- especially when home is Australia.
Urban-nightmare British black comedies have been rather too thick on
the ground since Pete Davies's 1980s London dystopia The Last Election,
but Geoff Nicholson's Still Life With Volkswagens (Sceptre, #5.99)
brings a welcome touch of the ridiculous and fantastical to its tale of
Nazi skinheads, exploding VW Beetles, and care in the community.
London's burning, but for once -- pace The Clash -- not with boredom.

ORSON WELLES:
THE ROAD TO XANADU
Simon Callow
Jonathan Cape, #20
WHEN Simon Callow was in Japan recently with his production of
Hammerstein's Carmen Jones, cheese was the main problem. Certain
expensive French restaurants apart, cheese is an unusual commodity in
Japan. And Callow, something of a gourmand, likes good cheese. He tells
a story against himself about a visit to his accountant. ''Do you know
what you've made?'' chided the number-cruncher. ''Where has it all
gone?'' An unbelievably sheepish Callow replies: ''I think I must have
eaten it.''
Perhaps it is that appetite that attracted him to the larger-than-life
character (and requisitioner of school food parcels, if we are to
believe this book) that is Orson Welles. Callow's cultural appetite is
certainly as large as that of his subject -- actor, writer, and
director, he must hope he continues to fail to measure up in girth (even
if his associate director on Carmen Jones, Glasgow's James Ross,
tactlessly expressed surprise that his boss was wearing padding for his
role in Four Weddings and a Funeral).
Theatre's renaissance men are much noted these days, but Callow
escapes much of the attention. Where Stephen Fry is affable but
confused, and Jonathan Miller is irascible and contradictory, Callow is
implacable and committed -- not obviously good copy. It is still a
source of some wonderment that he has managed to produce a volume as
fine as this, the first of a two-part biography of Welles, at the same
time as fulfilling all the other commitments which have brought him to
our attention.
It may be natural to assume that there is little more to be said about
Welles, whose unusual upbringing and resultant confidence made his life
a matter of some post-Freudian psychological interest. A man whose work,
with the Mercury Theatre, through the notorious War of the Worlds
broadcast, culminates in a stop-go cinema and television career that
includes a film often cited as the pinnacle of the medium, Citizen Kane.
Callow addresses that problem in his preface with considerable
confidence of his own. As he rightly suggests, the existence of previous
work on his subject, even -- perhaps particularly -- autobiographical
mythologising, only entices the curious mind. Callow's research has been
as wide as any of the predecessors he cites, and often a good deal less
reverential to the subject. But this is no hatchet-job, rather he --
like Donald Clarke in his Billie Holiday book, Wishing on the Moon --
comes to the project with an attitude. It is one that is open to change
but is fixed in its purpose and in a basic quest for truth.
Beyond that, Callow is so immersed in the profession that every
reference to a play or a theatrical technique comes with an
understanding and, usually, an unpatronising gloss that helps the reader
along the same path. Sometimes these are rather too glib.
''To call Citizen Kane the greatest film ever made is like saying that
Love's Labour's Lost or maybe Titus Andronicus is the greatest play ever
written,'' he avers. But the point, surely -- and especially about
Citizen Kane -- is that we understand fully the context in which Citizen
Kane was produced in a way we cannot possibly do for Shakespeare's
earliest works. Even if it still seems remarkable that Welles was 26 the
week the film was eventually released.
It is the context of twentieth-century history -- and a sense of how
much has been telescoped into the century -- that makes Welles's
relatively brief life so fascinating. The furore over The War of The
Worlds broadcast on Hallowe'en night 1938 was, Callow makes clear, an
unbelievable accident of collective creativity and mass hysteria. Howard
Koch's script had only been written when he was told that the
alternative was a dramatisation of Lorna Doone. He adopted John
Houseman's idea of using a news-bulletin format and people were only
unnerved because they tuned in after the programme had begun and --
quite incredibly -- chose to ignore three separate announcements during
the programme that they were listening to the Mercury Theatre of the Air
adaptation of H G Wells's book. Welles and his cohorts, far from being
elated by their theatrical coup, were in fear of physical violence and,
worse, litigation.
It is in the acknowledgment of the contribution of those colleagues
that Welles, convinced of his own genius from an early age, emerges with
least credit. He was furious when the script of War of Worlds was
published with, rightly, Koch's name on it. He fought over the crediting
of screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz on Citizen Kane, despite the fact
that Mank's input had been crucial in putting the project on the screen
(after Welles's adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness had remained
unfilmed -- and how much would any film enthusiast like to have seen
that!). But for all his inability to give credit where it was due, it is
tempting to conclude that these were merely matters of short-term public
status to Welles, however professionally dishonest they may seem now.
His relationship with Kenneth Tynan, begun with a fan letter from the
younger man, went on to survive a searingly caustic review of Hamlet by
the critic. Callow is unstinting in his itemising of the occasions when
Welles can be seen to have acted out of ego well beyond the realms of
decency, but is even-handed in acknowledging his achievements as a major
figure. It is a treatment he might wish for himself one day. Sometimes
regarded as being big-headed, he could still take the role of
Schikanader in the film version of Peter Shaffer's Amadeus after
premiering the title role on stage himself.

' With some reasonable referreeing I think England will win, but it
will not be that comfortable '
APART from the one unfortunate English rugby coach who, in 1990, had
to endure an after-match champagne reception with the Milne clan at
which the glorious Grand Slam team turned up in force, there is but one
message from the top London rugby clubs to the upstarts from Scotland
today: ''You haven't a chance!''
Dick Best, director or rugby at Harlequins and in 1990 an England
coach, remembers that weekend as if it was yesterday.
The unanimous message coming from London is this will be England's
Grand Slam. No doubt with his views coloured by the day England believed
their own publicity, Dick Best is hedging his bets ever so slightly.
Yes England will win, but it will not be by a cricket score, he says.
Other London coaches are equally conservative about the outcome, but
there are those who are amazed that Gavin Hastings and his lot will even
have the temerity to take the field at Twickenham.
England, with their no-nonsense approach to the game and with
ambitions to go on to win the World Cup, will not have too much
difficulty in dealing with this team of crofters from north of the
Border.
Dick Best to this very day regrets how he got caught up in the
Scottish celebrations back in 1990.
As far as he is concerned there were but two good moments that
weekend. The first when he fled Heriot's clubhouse and the celebrating
hordes, who gave him more than a bit of stick, to discover the best
curry shop in the country. ''Out of adversity something positive always
turns up.''
The second, and by far the most important as far as he was concerned,
was when he eventually caught a flight out of Scotland and touched down
on English soil.
''I was one of the last Englishmen left in Scotland that weekend. It
was all very unpleasant,'' he says.
He recalls the day after the match. ''I actually had to have brunch
with the Milne family en bloc and then it was off to a champagne
reception at the Bear's house. We were joined by the bulk of the
Scottish team and once more I had to eat humble pie.
''You can imagine how much we enjoyed winning at Murrayfield in the
1991 World Cup semi final.''
As far as today is concerned? ''I think Scotland will push England
very close,'' he said.
''The Scots have found some confidence from somewhere and they are
playing some reasonable rugby. They will draw a lot of comfort from that
try against Wales. It was out of the top drawer ... one of the best
international tries I have seen.
''In addition, the Scots have had lady luck riding with them. Some of
the other five nations sides have been second division, but having said
that you still have to score the points.
''This will be a good play off. With the Twickenham crowd and some
reasonable referreeing I think England will win, but it will not be that
comfortable.
''The tag of Grand Slam puts unbelievable pressure on both sides and
if Scotland can run at England, which is now unquestionably a formidable
team, then I think they will test them.''
John Kingston, Richmond's coach, is in no doubt about the outcome.
''As a Geordie I have a certain sympathy towards Scotland,'' he said.
''But I regret to tell you ... no I don't, it doesn't bother me two
hoots ... you will not win. You have no chance ... no chance whatsoever.
Unfortunately from Scotland's point of view, I can't see too many
weaknesses in the England side. I am not being biased, I genuinely
believe there will be a 20 point gap at the end of the game.
''Sorry to spoil your day.''
Scots fans take heart, Richmond -- one of the country's oldest and
most respected clubs -- is not faring too well in the English Courage
League third division.
Blackheath, on the other hand, the oldest open rugby club in the
world, are heading that division and are looking forward to promotion.
Rather pompously they call themselves ''Club'' and a long line of
distinguished past members includes Dr Watson of Sherlock Holmes fame.
Declaring an interest, it also happens Blackheath is my own club.
''I think this will be a great game of rugby,'' said Danny Vaughan,
head coach of the first XV squad, ''but there is no doubt England will
be too strong up front for Scotland at Twickenham. I think you will try
and run us around, but you won't have the base at the lineout and
scrummage to get it moving.
''Scotland's best chances will be in the loose, but when it comes to
the set piece England will dominate.
''The Scots will give us a run for our money, but at the end of the
day it will be England's Grand Slam. Mind you I would not be prepared to
bet the family fortune on it.''
The same cautious note was being sounded by Rob Smith, coach at Wasps.
''I think it will be a bit closer than people are calling,'' he said.
''I would make England favourites, but it will be a tough encounter. A
lot could depend on how the early scoring goes. I would be looking for a
25-16 win for England, something of that order.
''Whatever happens, I don't think England will run away with it.
''I have no doubt it will be a lot fiercer and closer than people
think. I have heard a lot of people dismiss Scotland out of the game, I
can't see that at all,'' he said.
''It is the Grand Slam show-down and that is going to give both teams
a bit of an edge. It is going to be very intense out there.''
And so to Peter Berryman of Roslyn Park. ''I think England will win
for the simple reason they have now played three very fine games in
totally different circumstances.
''Cardiff has always been a nightmare for us, but England sailed
through at the end of the day and honestly they will be just a bit too
strong for Scotland. Not just physically, but mentally as well. Scotland
will be fired up and have everything to play for. Their eyes will be
glittering and the bookmakers' odds won't matter to them.
''Gavin Hasting will have told them 'Hey look, if we beat the buggers
at Twickenham, it is an even bigger scalp than doing them at
Murrayfield. Let's turn them on in their own territory!'
''You are talking to someone who, before the five nations began,
placed a #5 bet at 4-1 that Scotland would win at least two of their
games. I didn't expect the victory in Paris. I certainly don't
anticipate an upset today.''
There you have it Scotland. London says there will be no champagne
celebration tonight. But I have to say that my English friends are
always very nervous on the day.
Back to Dick Best: ''We have open house for the Milne family this
weekend. If my prediction is wrong, the Milnes might be there tonight,
but I certainly will not.''

TRAFALGAR HOUSE is waiting to hear this morning whether the full
Takeover Panel will reverse the decision of the executive and allow its
950p a share bid for Northern Electric to proceed.
Late on Wednesday, the executive said that Trafalgar could not
resurrect the offer which lapsed on Friday for at least a full year
under rule 35.1. However, Trafalgar will argue that the circumstances
are so execptional that a waiver should be allowed and that it can
proceed.
Industry regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild is expected to make
known his thoughts on insustry pricing by next Friday although the
details of his proposals will probably not be known until June.
Trafalgar has the moral victory as throughout the battle its
intentions have been clear. Few could argue that Professor Littlechild's
sudden disclosure that he was changing all the ground rules as regards
pricing represents anything other than exceptional and very unusual
circumstances which could not have been forseen.
Northern shares fell 40p to 782p while there were comparatively minor
movements either way among the other 11 English and Welsh electricity
companies.

CITY pundits have begun to contemplate the possibility of an overshoot
on the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in the year to the end of
this after the February deficit came in over a #1000m higher than
expected.
The Treasury has forecast a PSBR of #34.3bn for the 1994/5 fiscal year
against #45.3bn last year but with the mad March spend still to come the
total so far is #25.2bn, nearly #9000m better than at the same point
last year.
Economists at two of the City's leading houses, Goldman Sachs and
James Capel, agreed that annualising the improvement for the first 11
months of the year would result in a PSBR of #35bn for the full year.
February had been expected to produce a deficit of around #4000m, but
in fact the PSBR emerged at #5200m with little in the way of
privatisation proceeds.
James Capel's Adam Cole said there was no improvement from a year ago
compared with earlier monthly figures showing deficits averaging about
#1000m less than in 1993/4.
March is traditionally a high spending month as Government departments
try to use up their budget allocations. As such it is the most
unpredictable month in the year.
Goldman Sachs's David Walton said the out-turn for the PSBR could
easily be in a range of #32bn to #36bn after taking account of the
privatisation proceeds from the recent National Power and PowerGen
flotations.
But he considered the Budget forecast was realistic. Goldman Sachs'
own forecast of #32bn has been revised up to #34bn.
Mr Walton said: ''The PSBR remains on a sharply improving trend and
will fall further next year on the back of tax increases, public
expenditure restraint, and continued economic growth.''
The Treasury is predicting a PSBR of #21.5bn, equal to 3% of gross
domestic product, for the coming year.
Mr Cole said the central government's deficit was coming in much as
expected so far this year. Revenues and spending were both lower, but
local authorities and public corporations were borrowing more than the
Treasury had expected.

LEGAL &amp; General is aiming to secure more of the profits from its life
fund for the benefit of its shareholders.
The group is in talks with the Department of Trade and Industry, which
regulates the insurance industry, to put the transfer from the life fund
to the shareholders' interest on a more ''rational'' basis. This would
support its progressive dividend policy.
However chief executive David Prosser was at pains yesterday to warn
that the change would not make a large difference to the funds available
for shareholders.
''Any change is not going to undermine the long-term financial
strength of the life fund and there will be no bonanza for
shareholders,'' he said.
Nevertheless L&amp;G shares jumped 18p to 477p, additionally helped by the
1994 results which showed profits up from #145m to #216.6m before
investment losses. Dividends go up 8% to 21.7p with a final of 14.75p.
The shares are supported by a 5.7% yield.
L&amp;G has followed the trend in reducing its with-profits bonus, so that
a typical maturing #30 a month 25 year policy would yield #60,574, down
from #62,043 a year ago. This represents an annual return of 13.1%. Ten
year payouts are down from #6175 to #5814.
The group temporarily withdrew from the pension transfer market last
year when the pensions mis-selling scandal broke and this hit its new
business, which shrank from #242m to #203m. But profits on the UK life
and pensions side were 6% higher at #127m after cost-cutting.
Ahead of commission disclosure, L&amp;G more than halved its financial
consultants to 1100 and did the same with the sales management which now
numbers 110. Branch offices were cut from 71 to 26. Overall it is hoped
to save #15m a year. About #10m was spent on upgrading systems to cope
with commission disclosure. Since then sales have been sluggish but are
now starting to pick up.
General insurance last year showed a recovery from underwriting losses
of #27.3m to profits of #35.7m on the back of more selective
underwriting and higher premium rates. Mr Prosser believes the downturn
in the insurance cycle has begun, with motor premiums under pressure
from the direct insurers and Halifax having recently cut household
premiums by up to 25%.
With the fall in share and bond markets, L&amp;G suffered realised and
unrealised investment losses of #52m against a surplus of #36m in 1993,
though shareholders' interest in the life fund was only 3% lower. The
life fund itself suffered an 8% fall, which was less than the drop in
the markets.

IF there's a secret to success in gardening, perhaps Helen Gallacher
knows it.
She used to work for the FBI, no less, cleared for handling secret
files. And the same applied when she was secretary with Barr and
Stroud's research and development think tank.
Since then, based at Stonedyke and specialising in rare plants, she's
been winning cups and trophies for ages. And passing on good advice at
Anniesland College to those who have retired and want something
interesting to spend their time on.
Knowing what to do, and how to do it, could be influenced by husband
Charlie, holder of the long service medal from the Royal Horticultural
Society. He served over the years at Bellahouston Park, Pollok Estate,
and then Victoria Park in Glasgow.
''We're both very keen on gardening. He tries to tell me what to do. I
just go my own way, of course,'' Helen Gallacher says cheerfully. ''We
like to encourage others to take up gardening. It's a fascinating hobby.
''Actually, if there is any secret to winning shows and that kind of
thing, it has to be timing. In many cases it's easy enough to grow
plants. It's getting them just right, at the right time, to meet the
judges' requirements -- that's the secret.''
Helen Gallacher seems to practise what she teaches. She is pictured
(right) with husband Charlie, after one of the classes she won at the
weekend, for orchids, at the Bearsden Horticultural Show.

AS Scotland's coaches, Douglas Morgan and Richie Dixon, consider the
content and tone of their final team talk for Scotland's attempt to
scale the highest mountain they ever have taken on, one guesses that
much of the strategy that served Scotland so well in 1990 will be
incorporated into their battle plan.
The circumstances are not dissimilar. Notwithstanding their
magnificent renaissance in this Five Nations, Scotland are not expected
to win. Not only is history against them but the powerful and
unrestrained nationalism of the vociferous England support might have an
adverse effect on the ability of those Scots new to the Twickenham
cacophony to hold their focus levels so as to function at peak.
England are even more powerful at forward now, with particular size
and dynamism in their breakaway unit. They also are even more
potentially lethal in their back division, when one takes into account
the growing stature and searching meanderings of Tony Underwood, the
swift intrusive contributions of Mike Catt, and the alarming statistic
that this English back division not only boasts 257 caps but 81 major
international tries as well.
The first element of the 1990 planning that Morgan, who was actively
concerned in that 1990 Grand Slam, will want to ensure is that
Scotland's own setpiece return is of quality. Of course, subsequent
phase ball, especially when of quick delivery, is the stuff of
penetrative play, but unless scrummage and lineout are productive and
dependable, ruck and maul work so often is conducted on the back foot
and, in addition, there is an unfavourable launch platform for initial
attack ploys by the forwards.
This Scottish scrummage has proved adequate, and David Hilton should
have an interesting tete-a-tete with his Bath colleague, Victor Ubogu.
Scotland, however, should aim for spending as little time on scrummaging
as possible, with speedy readiness and quick insertion. The key quality
of this Scottish pack is their mobility about the paddock and the less
time they spend with antlers locked against such a heavy English outfit,
the better.
Peter Wright, too, must beware of conceding collapse penalties
although one suspected in the Welsh game that responsibility was equally
apportionable.
Scotland should aim at the lineouts to disturb English organisation
and habit by occasional use of two-man lines to provide space for living
on their wits and with some of the positional switching by which English
composure was ruffled in 1990.
On England's ball, Doddie Weir should take on Martin Bayfield, all 6ft
10ins of him, and Rob Wainwright should deal with Ben Clarke at the
tail, for Clarke would have advantage in height and jump over Iain
Morrison. If conditions are conducive, the English are likely to make
frequent use of long throws as one means of temporarily taking out of
the open play a Scottish loose forward trio who are beginning to take on
the mantle of the Jim Calder-Paxton-Leslie and Jeffrey-White-Finlay
Calder combines.
Provided quality set position ball is forthcoming, Craig Chalmers will
have as one priority a shoal of high bombs reigning down on fullback
Catt and in behind the Underwood brothers, who previously have shown
frailty in retreat cover. Thereafter, the Chalmers' judgment of what is
good ball and what isn't will be a crucial ingredient as will be the
collective will of the entire Scottish side to ensure ball retention or
delivery at contact points and, where possible, to knock opponents
backwards in the tackle.
Certainly first tackles have to be effective round the fringes and in
midfield so that Scotland's midfield players are not drawn out of
position by having to engage an English forward stampede.
Elsewhere, the Scots must seek to take the game to England with or
without the ball, aim to create the impression of 100mph action by
shifting them about the pitch with quick restarts and snappy switches
thus lending them no time to settle. A tall order but one that has been
successfully accomplished in the past.
But the starting points are crucial. As big Bill Hunter, Hawick's
international lock, always says: ''Ba'. It's a' aboot ba'. Ee canna dae
much withoot eet.''

PRETTY as snow may be, it certainly holds up gardening activities, and
we've had more than our fair share of it lately.
But watching where, and when, the snow melts can be useful. Where it
goes quickly will invariably be the warmest spot, which gets the benefit
of the sun.
This can be useful information in deciding where to place shrubs that
are not all that tender.
Places that may be in the shade now will get the full benefit of the

A THOUSAND MILES FROM NOWHERE:
TRUCKING TWO CONTINENTS
Graham Coster
Viking, #15
THERE is a hole in the heart of this book big enough to drive a truck
through and no amount of surgery will save it. But only when the reader
is one chapter shy of being able to unload and head for home is the
reason revealed. When talking about truck movies Graham Coster writes
elequently of what he has actually achieved.
''One day, perhaps, someone will apply such a treatment to the
long-haul guys, and come up with a trucking movie that captures not the
chromium accoutrements but the existence: not the climactic but the
plotless: a movie that doesn't get to the centre of things, but is
always halted and turned back on the periphery, that looks over at the
action from the road that bypasses it: a movie that lets all the
wide-open space in the world in. One day, perhaps, someone will make a
Paris, Texas, with Peterbilts.''
There haven't been all that many movies which celebrate the concrete
ribbon of road and the 16-wheel, 10-tonne nomads who unspool along it.
Smokey And The Bandit had Burt Reynolds, White Line Fever had Jan
Michael Vincent, and Convoy had Sam Peckinpah hitch a bad movie on to a
good country and western song and drag the CB craze above ground. ''I
said Big Ben this here's the Rubber Duck and I'm about to put the hammer
down.'' The critics cocked the hammer and blew Convoy back to a
trailer-park in Spokane.
Truck windscreens continue to grant a cinemascope view of the world,
and on the road you'll find stars and bit-part characters. Men like the
million-milers who wear the commemorative buckles their employers bought
for their belts; like The Professor who drives long-haul to the complete
repetoire of Jacqueline Du Pre, and toff Andrew Wilson Young who lived
off yoghurt and tinned chicken, trashed a truck a year, and when given
six weeks to live snuffed it in five, to beat an ironic and personal
deadline.
The backdrops are also novel. In America there now exists the
Association of Christian Truckers founded by Chaplain Jim, who hauls his
own mobile chapel on board a trailer entitled ''Spirit of the Road'' and
flogs mudflaps bearing the brand ''Jesus Carries My Load'' through his
free-sheet, Wheels Alive. But then there are truckers for whom God's
existence hinges on his membership of the Teamsters, the legendary union
formed by Jimmy Hoffa, whose strong arm has diminished since his death
and Reagan's decision to deregulate the industry.
But Graham Coster did not begin his truck trek across two continents
in among the gleaming chrome of America's Macks. Instead he started out
in Essex and Truckworld, where the entertainment by day was derived from
his own handling of a HGV called Wanda, and at night from the local
stripper, Amber, handling herself. But this brief glance evaporates like
the heat-haze notion of truckers as nomads on a tarmacked desert.
The ''freedom'' of the open road is exposed on a hitched ride to
Moscow as a break-neck battle to cross borders and manipulate each
nation's rules against the constant tick-tock of the tachograph. Under
EC regulations drivers cannot drive for more than four-and-a-half hours
without a 40-minute break, so the spy-in-the-cab simply cracks the whip
on a series of shorter sprints.
In reality a driver's life is severely restricted, a prisoner of time,
passing sights he will never see except receding inside a wing-mirror.
In Moscow Coster only glimpsed the Kremlin as Tony the driver swung his
Silver Knight round the streets towards the Red Lion, an English pub and
destination for 20,000 pints of Guinness and ale.
Everything society consumes is delivered by truck, yet the drivers
exist on the hard shoulder. Truck stops lie on each town's outskirts,
ferry crossings go on all night, and cab bunks can offer only more
solitary respite. One driver now slurs his words as there was so seldom
anyone to hear them.
An Atlantic-wide attitude seperates the European princes from the
American kings of the road. On the autobahns drivers seem to be running
away from heavy HP payments and road tax, while one Yankee driver said:
''You see, when I'm leaving home . . . it's not that I'm leaving home,
I'm just heading back by a kind of a long way round.''
Country and western music is the thread which draws both cultures
together. This book's title is taken from a song by Dwight Yoakam, a
singer who spent six years behind a truck wheel. ''I'm a thousand miles
from nowhere / time don't matter to me / 'cause I'm a thousand miles
from nowhere / And there's no place I want to be . . . ''
And so to the hole in the heart. Coster, a sharp witty writer, has
shared his infectious love of shuddering gears and the gleaming hulks of
land leviathans, but when faced with a junction between travel writing
and the weight of hard facts he has simply steamed along the central
reservation, offering us only a teasing view of both roads as they
disappear into the distance.

IT is the match where all the prizes the European game has to offer
are there for the taking. The Grand Slam, the Championship, the Triple
Crown and the Calcutta Cup lie within reach of both Scotland and England
at Twickenham this afternoon.
The winners will go to the World Cup in South Africa as European
Champions, and for the losers there will be nothing. But this is not the
whole story or the entire truth.
Win, lose or draw this afternoon, Scotland have already salvaged in
glorious fashion something from this season which, just eight weeks ago,
few would have credited. Gavin Hastings and his side have won the hearts
and minds of a Scottish rugby public which, as the year began, was at
best sceptical and, at worst, downright cantankerous.
The manager, the coaches, the captain and most of his side were
objects of scorn and ridicule. Nine games had gone without a victory in
a losing streak which stretched back to 1993. That was the year the All
Blacks inflicted a 51-15 humiliation on Hastings and his men at
Murrayfield and in the Five Nations' campaign which followed the best
the Scots could do was register a draw over Ireland in Dublin.
The South Africans were at Murrayfield last November and a six-try
rout had the Scots reeling on the ropes. They were down but not yet
counted out. And, as we now know, nor would they be.
The A team had got into the winning habit. Before the game against
Canada at Murrayfield in late January, 10 changes would be made to the
senior side and the entire shadow side front five, with the exclusion of
the skipper Kevin McKenzie, would be drafted into the big team.
The transfusion worked a treat. Scotland won 22-6, Hastings signalled
that there was life in the old dog yet with 17 points from the boot, and
a rejuvenated Damian Cronin scored a come-back try.
That win set the Scots up for the Five Nations' campaign which was to
begin two weeks later. Ireland were disposed of 26-13 and Hastings,
again on majestic kicking form with 16 points, won his Scottish
record-breaking fifty-third cap. There were tries from Craig Joiner, and
for the second time within two matches, Damian Cronin.
France in Paris were next on the agenda. The Scots had not won there
since 1969 and, in a game overflowing with high passion and drama, that
hoodoo was laid to rest with tries from Gregor Townsend and Hastings --
a mesmeric affair in which Toonie's flip pass entered rugby mythology --
contributing to a heroic 21-23 victory. Sadly, Parc des Princes also saw
the end of the Five Nations' trail for the injured Ian Jardine and
Cronin.
Next came Wales. Last season's champions represented, in manager
Duncan Paterson's words, the semi-final. With Scott Hastings recalled to
the side in place of Jardine, and Doddie Weir continuing where he had
left off in Paris for Damian Cronin, the Scots played some of the best
rugby seen at Murrayfield in many a long year to slay the dragon 26-13.
There were tries from the Bath Brigade -- Eric Peters and Dave Hilton --
and, yet again, Hastings kicked magnificently to harvest another 16
points from the boot.
Which is where we came in. At Twickenham today the trail ends. England
at home are an awesome prospect but, as assistant coach Richie Dixon so
graphically observed earlier this week, nobody has yet rattled their
teeth. Let the rattling commence!

SHE began as the pouting starlet, graduated to luscious leading lady,
and when she got up there on the silver screen pedestal, Hollywood began
talking about Kim Basinger as a mixed-up personality. There were stories
of psychics and demands that her hair only be washed in Evian water,
that she was power mad, a sex-pot, a control freak, she was this and she
was that. One tale gossiped into another around her classic 36-24-36
siren of a figure that today remains more heart-threatening than
cholesterol.
At 42, Kim Basinger has kept her body and mind in shape and it has
helped her to survive. She's had to be sharp, for the early Nineties
were not kind.
Eighteen months ago it looked as if all had finally finished for this
ravishing creature from America's Deep South. She was sued for jilting
the movie Boxing Helena, which was about bizarre and besotted love.
Instead of starring as a woman with no arms or legs, who is kept in a
box by an obsessed admirer, she was accused of reneging on an oral
agreement. A jury awarded $8.9m against her and it was revealed that her
net worth was $5,387,382 and 19 cents. The arithmetic of that court
decision added up to her filing for bankruptcy.
Her husband, actor Alec Baldwin, said of the verdict: ''The jury
thought they had handed down a bill that surely she could pay. I guess
they felt that everyone who did Batman got $40m.''
But the determination that got Basinger from Athens, Georgia, to
California in the first place kicked in. She went to work. And kept
things in the family by co-starring last summer with Baldwin in a remake
of 1972's The Gateway, which featured another real life couple, Steve
McQueen and Ali MacGraw.
The worldwide reaction was remarkable. ''She seems to have come to the
role at a perfect point in her career,'' wrote one critic, adding:
''Like the character she plays, she's clearly been round the block a few
times, made a few bad decisions, but she's looking better than ever.''
With an almost unanimously favourable reaction, she and Baldwin seemed
to have come to terms with the result of the court case, although they
insist they could never agree with it. Baldwin is determined: ''I will
not stop until she gets a fair shake.''
And it appears she may. In a startling turn of events, a California
appeals court overturned the multi-million dollar judgment against
Basinger last September. But in the LA laywer land of California the
case is expected to be back in the courts yet again before Easter. It
will involve ''appellate specialists'' and other euphemisms meaning this
one could run for ever and ever.
But whatever happens legally, Basinger has escaped personality
purgatory.
In her Armani suit -- as pale as her face: she avoids the sun strictly
-- she does not in person live up to her ''difficult'' reputation. She's
arguably too eager to please. Two years ago she cropped off her
trademark flowing crown of curls in what seemed an attempt to be taken
seriously.
Now at an age when most pouting starlets are normally languishing,
rather than lounging, at the shallow end of some producer's swimming
pool and attention span, she is in demand. ''I came up with an idea the
other day, asking if the girl inside me could get to stand beside me and
go walk down the street with the girl that's on the outside; if they'd
stick together or leave each other. They're so different.
''It's very difficult to be taken seriously in a town as small as this
one, and in an entertainment business like this. There are so many
beautiful girls and they're this and that and the other thing. It's very
hard. There is a large percentage of people who don't have the guts to
stand up for what they believe in and they'll go with the crowd. It's
only the very few who will say: 'I'm going to judge for myself' before
they make a choice. I had to learn this, I really did.''
Her career has fanned much fantasy into fact and vice-versa. It was as
hometown beauty queen -- it was in the Georgia cornfields that she says
she first discovered oral sex -- that she went to New York; model,
Hollywood television series walk-on, stapled naked in eight pages of
Playboy. Her Bond girl in Sean Connery's misunderstood 007 return in
Never Say Never Again began a busy big screen acting career.
Since then she has been the disquieting sexual presence in many films.
She was Mickey Rourke's love slave in 9[1/2] Weeks, tempted Robert
Redford in The Natural, gave Bruce Willis a difficult time in Blind
Date, Richard Gere the runaround in No Mercy and Final Analysis and, of
course, got the caped crusader's wings flapping as Vicki Vale in Batman.
As she did the gossips. She was involved with Prince, who was doing
the Batman music, and also dating Jon Peters, the Streisand Svengali who
co-produced the box office giant and has now turned many red-blooded men
green by taking up with Pamela Anderson of Baywatch.
Basinger's marriage to make-up man Rob Britton ended after eight
years, and she swore she was never getting married again. It was just
her and her dogs and cats -- she picks up strays all the time -- at her
home in the San Fernando Valley outside Los Angeles. Alec Baldwin
changed her viewpoint.
They married four times in The Marrying Man, then finally for real.
For them it may have been romantic. Many involved in the making of the
1991 film talk of it as a nightmare and Mr and Mrs B as the principal
demons.
It was said that she contractually demanded that her hair only be
washed in Evian water; that she asked for filming to be stopped so she
could fly to Brazil to consult a psychic. One crew member said that was
''only the tip of the iceberg''.  It was, in fact, ''much, much worse''.
Basinger shakes her head. ''You hear a lot of good and bad about
yourself, and then you hear remarks about your hair . . . my father
always told me to judge for myself. I think when you change your life
and you really have the guts to change your life, some people take
notice in a good vein and others in a negative vein. After I divorced my
husband, everything started happening. I had been married for eight
years and then after that I was free and I was happy and I could make
choices.
''In doing that you cause more attention and then you start really
saying  how you feel. I am shy, but I think the easiest thing in the
world is to tell the truth. When I started telling the truth about the
way I felt and even made it publicly known, people didn't want that. It
was never intended to cause trouble, but people view saying how you feel
as causing trouble sometimes.''
One such very public time was at the Oscars when, watched by a billion
viewers, she scolded the voters for not nominating director Spike Lee's
movie Do The Right Thing.
''I would do it all over again. I felt it was a shame to leave out
that film. Everybody had been talking about truth, and I thought it
presented the biggest truth of all. I wasn't reprimanding the Academy or
anything like that. It just truly came from the heart, from inside. One
billion people were watching, and I said: 'Well, Lord, help me get
through this because it's the biggest audience I'm ever going to have in
my life.'''
And, to explain another point, she says God is her only psychic. ''He
knows everything.'' About the Evian water? '''You mean the gallons and
gallons I wash my hair in? I drink it. But I drink all kinds of other
waters as well.''
The designer water storm-in-a-bottle turns her on to her health
habits: ''I'm a vegetarian. I don't eat dairy products or meat. I love
to exercise -- it's like brushing my teeth.'' She wasn't always so
careful.
''When I came to Los Angeles, I said: 'I want to take everything. I
want to try it all.' And some friend said: 'Oh, try this.' That's always
the way it gets started. I tried cocaine and I found that it made people
sleep during the day. Every time I took it I said: 'This is a joke.' The
next day I couldn't even . . .  it's a debilitating drug. I hated that
it made me so physically worn out.
''I thank God, I really do, with all my heart. Because I saw a lot of
people use cocaine every day. So many girls got hooked into it, some
because they were working in the industry and wanted to stay thin. And
believe me, I know exactly what it does to your body. Watching these
girls just completely lose everything they had and then try and get
themselves back in balance -- it was bad.
''What cocaine did for me was make me very smart in one way. It made
me know that you can never use it and get by. Because I've always been
very physical. I work out every day. I love any physical activity. I'll
run with anybody, do whatever they want to do.
''Believe me, I'm no Mother Teresa. I've done a lot of wild-ass things
in my life. It's just that I can be wild without drugs and alcohol. And
so can anybody. Cocaine doesn't break your inhibitions like you think it
does.
''I don't think there is anybody who can really handle drugs.''
If drugs is one curse of Hollywood, so is ageism. Is she frightened
about being in her forties? ''I don't really have time for all that. I
don't know what the future is going to hold. We never know how long any
of us is gonna be around. I think staying and looking and feeling young
have a lot to do with your beliefs. It's only society that put 24 hours
in a day. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 years a year -- from one year old
to 60 or 70 or 80 years old. The clock just rules the hell out of all of
us and it's so sad.
''I don't really live in a time zone. I don't abide by the rules here
on earth. We're not talking about police or crime or anything. I'm
talking about clocks. Boy, when it comes to clocks ticking away, it all
depends how you grow.''
And she wants her family to grow. ''Alec and I want lots of kids
everywhere -- a big family. I never want to give up my work -- don't get
me wrong. But he is my life's focus.''
There are shades of Evian water and psychics as she talks on. ''After
all of this, sometimes I think there would be no Kim Basinger without
Alec. Some days during the insane court ordeal I would look at him and
ask: 'Who is Kim Basinger?'
Who indeed?
Her home in Woodland Hills, a very non-celebrity area of Los Angeles
is, she says, her sanctuary. There are shih-tzu dogs following her
around, well, like puppies. There's a gym and an entertainment centre
with a white piano -- she's an accomplished singer -- and a chaise
longue, a keepsake from The Marrying Man, to remind her of when she met
Baldwin.
They married on August 19, 1993, -- she was working and he arranged
all the details of the ceremony at East Hampton, New York -- and she
says: ''After the wedding I said: 'This is truly a memory'. It was a
small, simple party at the ocean and everything came out splendidly.''
Which is how she hopes the future will. But the Boxing Helena saga
goes on -- the film was finally made starring Sherilyn (Twin Peaks) Fenn
and did poor business -- and she can't stop being cynical.
''It's all become such a mad frenzy. Who's stabbing you in the back or
doing it in front of your face. A lot of that goes on. Once again it is
about trust. I truly love the business between 'Action' and 'Cut', but I
think now there's something that I never faced.
''There's an element of 'let's find something out on that somebody so
we can bring them down'. It's not about truth -- it's about seeing
people squirm. That's very sad.
''It makes you slow to trust again . . . but I will. How much faith do
we have in each other and in life? There's not much trust in the world
on a daily basis. In business and between spouses and families -- you
don't see it very often.
''But I trust Alec. He trusts me. Together we will overcome all the
obstacles.''

' The Grand Slam, though, is the Big One and in a Scottish context it
has a rarity value which rivals an Iain Milne sidestep '
THE Five Nations' championship is a sporting gem beyond price and the
tantalising promise of a Grand Slam is the ingredient which provides the
extra sparkle.
Football, through neglect and the terracing yobs, has lost its Home
Championship, and how the Association code must envy rugby's springtime
extravaganza when the Five Nations' campaign becomes the focal point of
northern hemisphere rugby.
The Championship is adorned with prizes mythical and physical.
Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales do battle each season for the
Triple Crown. Never mind that the trophy does not exist, the winning of
it is no less diminished for that.
Only since 1993 has there been a Five Nations' Championship trophy for
the winning captain to hold on high. But, in a series which dates from
1910, the lack of a bauble for the trophy room was not seen as a
hindrance to the spectacle which the Championship has provided for the
millions who have watched over the years.
Today, in addition to everything else, the Calcutta Cup is up for
grabs. That one is real enough and the handsome trophy -- fashioned from
smelted silver rupees donated by the Calcutta Football Club in 1878 --
will be passed around brimful of champagne tonight at the post-match
banquet. Since 1990, courtesy of Bovis Construction, replicas have been
on public view at the Murrayfield and Twickenham museums.
Then there is that most unwanted of mythical awards, the Wooden Spoon,
which goes to the nation that finishes bottom of the table in each
season's championship. Scotland were wooden-spoonists last year and one
of the main attractions of the Championship -- and despite the fact that
there are only five contenders -- is the unpredictable manner in which
national fortunes turn from year to year like shifting sands.
Since that very first international against England in 1871, and since
1910 when France joined the Home Nations in competition, Scotland have
won ten Triple Crowns, 19 Championships -- and 24 wooden spoons.
The Grand Slam, though, is the Big One and in a Scottish context it
has a rarity value which rivals an Iain Milne sidestep. There have only
been three.
It is seventy years almost to the day since Phil Macpherson's Scottish
side vanquished the English at Murrayfield and recorded the first Grand
Slam in the history of the Scottish game.
Never mind that the term had not yet entered popular parlance and on
the day the Scots were sufficiently satisfied with the Calcutta Cup.
That first Slam came with perfect timing on the very day that Old
Murrayfield was used for the first time. The date was March 21, 1925,
and Scotland won 14-11.
Murrayfield, then the wonder of the sporting age, was brand-spanking
new and the carpenters had worked overnight to make the stadium ready
for the world-record crowd of 70,000 which packed in to see history in
the making. Scotland that day boasted the famous Oxford University
threequarter line of Macpherson, Aitken, Wallace and Waddell. Today, in
Wainwright, Peters and Morrison, Scotland field an all-Cambridge
University back row. An Oxbridge omen perhaps?
Fifty-nine years elapsed before Grand Slam glory came Scotland's way
again. Jim Aitken led the Scots to wins over Wales (9-15), England
(18-6) and Ireland (9-32). Then came the showdown with France at
Murrayfield. Jean-Pierre Rives' Frenchmen had Grand Slam designs of
their own and for the opening 20 minutes Scotland were under intense
pressure.
Gradually, inch by inch and minute by minute, the Scots edged
themselves back into the game and French discipline began to crack.
Peter Dods, who had suffered a bad eye injury early on, resembled a
prize-fighter as he battled on with a swelling the size of a lemon
closing one eye. His goal-kicking accuracy was not affected, however,
and he harvested 17 points with the boot to set a new Scottish record of
50 for the season.
The turning point -- captured on canvas in the Ronnie Browne painting
of the same name -- came with Jim Calder's try from a lineout on the
French line. Scotland scored 18 points in the last 14 minutes of the
game and by the end Gallic discipline was in tatters. Aitken and his men
were escorted from the pitch as Murrayfield erupted in scenes of
unconfined joy and the celebrations continued long into the night.
Next came the showdown to end all showdowns at Murrayfield on March
17, 1990. England arrived as out-and-out favourites but they were sent
hameward tae think again. David Sole and his doughty Scots out-thought
and out-played Will Carling's Englishmen in a game of nerve-tingling
intensity.
From The Walk and Flower of Scotland until the final whistle, as
Scotland withstood wave after wave of English attacks, Murrayfield had
never hosted a match of such high-voltage passion and excitement. Gavin
Hasting's chip in front of the old West Stand and the Tony Stanger try
which followed burn bright in the Scottish memory even yet. It was a
grand day to be able to say, in the words of the old Max Boyce ditty, I
was there.

BY YOUR leave, a brief piece of cinema history. In 1979 the French
director Bertrand Tavernier came to Glasgow to shoot a film. In 1979
Glasgow was not the madeover mecca it is today, but Tavernier knew a
good location when he saw one. ''C'est completment fou!'' he exclaimed,
supervising the sooty acropolis of the Royal Infirmary, the cathedral
and the Necropolis and the sociological strata exposed by the innercity
motorway. Tavernier had found his city of the nearfuture.
The director's early work (Les Enfants Gate, set in Paris, L'horloge
de Saint-Paul, made in Lyons) showed an interest in using the visual
language of cities to make connections between political and human
relationships. The fractured eccentricity of the Glasgow cityscape
supplied him with the emblems for a film about privacy, interference,
television and death. It was called Deathwatch.
During my years as a television critic I often thought about
Deathwatch as the cameras crawled closer and closer to its credible
sci-fi vision. This week they arrived. We didn't get Romy Schneider
playing a terminally-ll woman who sells her ''death rights'' to a
television network, but we did get a dying Dutchman playing himself
while the camera watched his GP ''put him to sleep''.
Privacy, interference, television and death. Tavernier's themes all
came together on BBC2 on Wednesday. And you know what bothered me most
about this public piece of mercy killing? Not the tormenting tangle of
ethics it presented, but the loss of privacy for the patient and his
wife -- even although they volunteered the final moments of their final
separation to what I imagine they thought was a greater good.
Privacy is an old-fashioned word. If, as Philip Larkin's rhyme goes,
sex was invented in 1963 then privacy was disinvented round about the
same time. Not for nothing did television's bid for supremacy as the
medium of popular culture gather momentum during the decade which
let-it-all-hang-out. It began by turning viewers into voyeurs and has
continued by turning voyeurs into performers.
A small display advertisement in Wednesday's Guardian newspaper: ''Are
you part of a STEP FAMILY? Has it been a God send or sheer hell? Have
things been difficult emotionally, financially? How do the first and
second families get on? Is there tension and rivalry or has it been a
success from start to finish? WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU -- Clare at the
BBC on 081 . . .''
They will get their performers, no bother. For every reader whose
gorge rises on the words None of Your Business there will be readers who
''want to help''; in much the same charitable spirit as those lovely
young people who volunteer their sexual couplings to the educational
video industry.
I'm a product of the sixties myself but I seem to have a gene missing
when it comes to self-exposure. Never take sweets from a television
researcher, that's my motto. I may have done a few broadcasts on issues
and in print touched lightly on my private life, but I'm no more likely
to permit colleagues in the media to dabble in the stuff of my soul than
I am to give up the last seat in the lifeboat. (Now there's a
confession.)
Is this unusual? Not among those who remember the sixties. An old
friend of mine, a Scot, is the current editor of Harpers and Queen,
which in terms of magazine journalism is superstardom. She still has a
family home in the North of Scotland. When she was asked for an
interview by the local newspaper she made her excuses. ''The last thing
I want when I go home is everyone needing to know if it really is like
Absolutely Fabulous.''
I think we're wary of hanging out our souls and pinning up our psyches
precisely because we lived through the sixties and saw what happened
during the vogue for encounter groups, the touchy-feely subculture which
borrowed recklessly from the theories of experimental therapies and sat
in circles in city gardens, on ground they rarely touched.
Misguided -- and they often were -- encounter groups unpicked the
stitching of perfectly sound relationships, scratched open wounds which
had healed themselves nicely, and inflamed and liberated egos which were
quite legitimately repressed.
Encounter group leaders were dentists of the emotions, but for every
rotten feeling they extracted there were another 10 which should have
been left in their sockets to service their owners for years to come.
In this climate privacy, like shame and guilt, became unacceptable
forms of oppression rather than useful mechanisms of social
co-operation. And what had been a dangerous hobby for self-selecting
travellers on the journey to Me quickly became the common currency of
print journalism, television chat shows and solemn documentaries.
Perhaps it was inevitable. Notions of privacy have always been
culturally determined, and shift with the times. The need for privacy,
the desire for privacy isn't a universal gut instinct, especially when
it comes to functions of the body .
Death is a neighbourhood festival in many countries; there are
societies who ritually witness the installation of newly married couples
in the nuptial bed; and if you'd lived in sixteenth-century London you
might have got to enjoy chatting cheek-to-cheek in Mayor Dick
Whittington's first public lavatory, which was a long bench suspended
over a ditch flushed by the Thames.
Our own concept of ''private life'', our perception of privacy as
something which gets ''invaded'', is down to the Victorians and the
growth of individualism as an ascendant idea. The Victorians muddied the
waters of a clear and useful principle -- the right to tell other people
to mind their own business -- by stirring in other, less-helpful
elements like prudishness, hypocrisy and the double-standard.
The progeny of their version of privacy, much mutated, was the
skeleton in the cupboard. By the 1960s it was time to give it an airing.
But its excursion has gathered momentum, taken off to the point where
the pursued have become the pursuers, the persecuted have become the
persecutors, and the outing has become Outing.
We have reached a stage where those who are careless of their own
privacy are profligate with the privacy of others; and with the gentle,
understated menace of their ''friendly'' correspondence they coerce
people like the Bishop of London to ''explain'' the fine-tuning of his
''ambiguous'' sexuality to the microphone and the camera.
Not for Dr David Hope the luxury of telling the world to mind its own
business; merely the bleak engagement of the reluctant performer in the
latest production of Gaywatch.

David Sole walked his team on to Murrayfield and the hairs on the back
of my neck stood up
THINGS had been looking so good for Roger Uttley, coach to the English
side, as they prepared for their epic showdown with the Scottish team on
March 17, 1990. Everything was at stake including, as the wags had put
it, the Grand Slam, Calcutta Cup, Triple Crown and, yes, the Cheltenham
Gold Cup.
Even at training things had felt good in the English camp. ''We ran
out at Peebles on the Friday, and we didn't drop a ball.
''Everyone there, including the journalists, said that it was one of
the best sessions they had ever seen,'' says Uttley, a teacher at
Harrow, one of England's top schools. ''People said that they had only
seen Southern Hemisphere teams train that way before, we were very
confident.
''On Saturday morning, again, we had a light session, and it was
perfect. Then we went down to the ground, got changed, and even when we
ran on to the pitch, I thought that the boys looked great, and fit, and
ready.''
But then something happened which, in the cold light of history,
changed that day forever in the hearts of Scottish people, and Uttley
was one of the first to notice it.
''I can remember it so vividly,'' he says. ''One minute I was feeling
so confident, and then the atmosphere changed suddenly. David Sole
walked his team on to Murrayfield slowly and purposefully.
''The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and I remember thinking
that something, somehow, just wasn't quite so right anymore.''
In the end, as every little Scottish schoolboy knows, Sole's men won
the day, a try-saving tackle by Scott Hastings on a flying Rory
Underwood, and a try by Tony Stanger from a little lob of a kick on the
run from Gavin Hastings, made all the difference.
England, firm favourites, had, in the eyes of most Englishmen, blown
it. The world erupted in unconfined joy, unless, that is, you were
English.
''We argued over short penalty decisions, we didn't capitalise on our
territory, and we let the Scots off the hook,'' says Uttley. ''They had
players like John Jeffrey who revelled in the confrontation, we made
mistakes. The Scots made a nuisance of themselves, which is what they do
-- it's one way of playing rugby -- and it paid off for them. That's why
we lost.''
And after, says Uttley, the Scots made the most of it. ''They rammed
the victory down our throats,'' he says. ''At the dinner they loved it,
they had a great night, and we didn't fly back to England, if I remember
rightly, until late Sunday evening, which meant a day in Edinburgh
before we left. It was one of the longest days of my life, and the
Scottish people loved it.''
But Uttley, a gentleman on the pitch and off it, as well as being one
of Britain's truly outstanding back row forwards through the seventies
and early eighties, knows that the English may believe themselves to be
the most civilised country in the world, but that civilisation, that
superiority, can come across as something totally different to those on
the other side of the fence.
''I suppose we came up to Scotland looking as though we had our noses
in the air, looking arrogant,'' he admits. ''The Scottish boys rammed it
down our throats good and proper, and the arrogance that they thought
they saw was dealt with. Back then they had players who seemed to love
the confrontation with England more than anything else. It was, to them,
a David and Goliath situation.''
But, lest we Scots think that we are the down-trodden race that can do
no wrong in the eyes of the world, backed up into our corner of the
playground by the school bully, and ridding the world of evil when we
take on our nice friends from south of the Border, Uttley remembers some
Scottish provocation in his own playing days of a very overt nature.
''There was a picture once of Alastair McHarg burning a Union Jack in
one of the papers,'' he says. ''Now, we may be the bigger country, but
that was incitement of a daft kind. Some people in Scotland have always
had an irrational view of us as Englishmen, a hostile view, and I have
always found that sad, and difficult to cope with.''
Having coached a Lions tour, one that included Scots, Uttley admires
some of our country's characters. ''I have always liked JJ, Gavin and
Scott. They are great lads,'' he says. He kept quiet about Finlay
Calder, the captain of Uttley's Lions, and a man who has aimed a barrage
of criticism at Uttley, criticism to which Uttley, to be fair, has
refused to respond.
What of today's epic, then? Are there lessons to be learned from 1990,
or even 1980, when Uttley was in Bill Beaumont's team that won its Grand
Slam at Murrayfield? ''I don't think that England will be duped into
over-confidence ever again in Five Nations' rugby, especially in such
big games,'' he says. ''We know that all of the other teams want to beat
us, and as Ireland and Wales have proved in recent seasons, it has been
possible to beat England, even when those teams are having difficult
seasons. Teams can always perform well against us.
''This game against Scotland is, to coin a phrase, just the next game
for England as they try to prepare to become a side that can
realistically challenge to win the World Cup.'' says Uttley. ''We have
still to reach a level of performance that can put us alongside Southern
Hemisphere teams. Our forward power has returned, there is a change of
attitude with Jack Rowell, and the players are playing for 80 minutes.
Both teams are playing the best rugby they have done for some time. This
will be some game.''
Scots will be hoping that a repeat of 1990 is possible, the English,
among them Roger Uttley, will want a performance to expunge that day
from the memory for ever. Sometimes the best lessons learned in life are
the toughest ones.

WHEN your lawn is not well it can be a puzzle to find out what has
gone wrong. Your best ally is a good magnifying glass.
You don't really need one when it comes to leatherjackets, earthworms,
chafers, and ants. Not everyone agrees with killing worms on lawns but
they can be a nuisance, leaving casts all over the place.
If you want to live and let live, switching the casts with a long,
whippy cane breaks them down. You can get a pest killer based on
carbaryl.
Lawn diseases are much more complex. I once shocked a fastidious
gardener by saying it didn't really matter what the disease was. The
control is much the same.
Dozens of fungal diseases can attack the lawn. Only two are of real
concern. One is fusarium patch, or snow mould, which can be very active
at this time of year.
About the only chemical available for amateurs is liquid copper. This
should be used repeatedly if you find areas of grass dying out. Once the
disease is controlled, new grass usually grows through.
Another disease is red thread. This can start as early as April and
carry on into the autumn, with a possible break in July.
This can cause leaf tips to wither and die back. If you look very
closely you can find coral pink or red strands. This is difficult to
control and regular feeding tends to mask the disease. Again, liquid
copper can be used but results are variable.
One other trouble is sheer rotting of the grass caused by wet, muggy
conditions. Or leaves left on the lawn, or shrouding by trees or shrubs.
Usually removing the cause takes care of things. It will often be
necessary to patch the lawn to bring cover back.

ITALY is the world's unsurpassed treasure house of great art.
Unfortunately much of that art has not been properly protected. In
Sicily, for example, many monuments have been shamefully neglected for
generations. And where the art is properly preserved, access to
churches, museums and galleries can be difficult. The most famous ones
tend to be overcrowded and many are subject to perverse and wayward
opening times.
For all these quibbles, Italy offers the cerebral or artistic tourist
riches beyond compare. The most magificent works are not always to be
found in the likeliest places. To come across Bernini's masterpiece
''The Blessed Ludovica'' in one of the side-chapels of a shabby, unsung
thirteenth-century church in run-down Trastevere is an epiphany. The
curious and the persistent are constantly rewarded in Italy, which
remains, despite everything, the most civilised of the world's great
countries.
James Hall's History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art is not a guide
to this cornucopia. Hall deals, as he frankly admits, with a few works
rather than many: the above-mentioned masterpiece by Bernini is just one
of many not discussed. What his book -- first published two years ago
and now out in a welcome, if expensive, paperback edition (#15.99, John
Murray) -- provides is background reading of the best kind.
Hall takes the art of the past in its own context, he explains that
context, and he eschews the scepticism or even cynicism of modern times.
He enters the medieval mind: ''We ought not to think of the strange
creatures of medieval art as 'fabulous' or 'fantastic' as they are
sometimes described. To the people of those times they were real enough.
They inhabited the distant lands at the earth's perimeter and were known
through travellers' tales.''
That passage is typical of Hall's style; here we have sympathetic art
history at its most practical and valuable. There is the bonus that Hall
always writes clearly and easily.
There is a sadness at the core of the book, in that we know that the
glories of the Renaissance will be followed by the slow decline of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. By 1800, the brutal era of
Napoleon, Italian art had, as Hall notes, dwindled almost into
insignificance; no longer were Italian artists capable of responding to
new ideas.
This book is an excellent companion for anyone who loves art or loves
Italy; it is indispensable for anyone who loves both.

I GOT into a heated argument recently about the correct treatment of
container-grown plants and trees.
My view was that, when planting this stock, it is advisable to try to
avoid too much root disturbance. My protagonist thought otherwise and
claimed years of experience to prove the point.
He claimed you have to break up the rootball to encourage roots to
grow out and establish quickly. This was particularly so if roots had
become balled or bound up.
To add strength to my argument I pointed out that it is not the larger
sections of root that suck up moisture. It is the small root hairs. If
you damage these you can give the plant a severe check.
I think this is one of those cases where we are both right. Much
depends on the time of year.
Planting in the dormant period, there is a lot to be said for
disturbing the roots and giving a wider area for potential
establishment.
On the other hand, when planting in the active season loss of root
hairs will be serious.
We both agreed that, with bare root stock, spreading roots over a wide
area was good gardening practice. There the matter rests -- on a
friendly basis, of course.

NKOA have quit the Glasgow League, just weeks before the start of the
season, and are linking up with Western Union strugglers Kilmarnock.
The predominantly Asian side hit the headlines last year when it was
alleged that one of their players threatened a Motherwell cricketer with
an iron bar during a match.
Last night the Glasgow club's vice-president, Ajaz Sher, insisted:
''We've resigned from the Glasgow League because the lads want to play
at a higher level. It's as simple as that. No-one's asked us to leave.
''Joining Kilmarnock will give our players a bigger stage. There's a
lot of ambitious lads in our ranks and they felt there was no chance of
being recognised for international honours in the Glasgow League.''
Fifteen NKOA players have joined Kilmarnock, but captain Alan Hill
claimed: ''It's not even a merger. Kilmarnock are simply getting a large
number of much-needed new members. I'm delighted.
''We may change our name to Kilmarnock NK -- that will be decided at
our agm next month. As far as the running of the club is concerned,
however, that will continue to be done by Kilmarnock people. Our
constitution does not allow new members on to the committee until
they've been with the club for two years. I will be continuing as
captain -- at least for the coming season.''

MY remit here is to put the boot into the English but my heart is not
in it. It is time we learned to love the English. By devoting so much of
our energy to hating our nearest neighbours we diminish ourselves.
Yes, they are an arrogant bunch. Never more so than in the matter of
sport. They call themselves the Rugby Union instead of the English Rugby
Union. The Football Association instead of the English Football
Association.
The English fans are at their worst at Twickenham, the braying
Barbour-jacketed hordes singing about their low-swinging chariots. They
have even hijacked Jerusalem, with the moving words about those feet in
ancient time. You could have a great time with a machine-gun at those
tremendously twee Twickenham tail-gate parties.
But mostly the English offend through ignorance rather than arrogance.
They actually think the Union flag is the English flag and that Bill
McLaren is the probably the best English rugby commentator of all time.
Lord, forgive them for they know not what they do.
Let us concentrate on the good points about English rugby fans. It's a
short list. They're quite polite, in the main, and they're not English
soccer fans.
The English fans can be pretty decent losers and might even buy you a
half of bitter. Unlike the Welsh, who go all morose and argue that they
have won a moral victory. You never beat the Welsh, you only score more
points than they do.
Let us learn to love even Nigel Starmer Hyphen Smith, especially now
his jaiket appears to be on a shaky nail as a BBC commentator. Nigel was
described to me once by an Irish colleague as ''three of the nicest
people you could meet''. Nigel is a nice guy. I know, he nearly bought
me a drink in Dublin once.
Another reason we must learn to love the English is that some of the
best players in the Scottish team are English. I refer to David Hilton,
the Bristol butcher, and Eric Peters his team-mate from Bath.
Will Carling, whose great-grandfather once bought a packet of Scott's
porage oats, would have made an inspirational Scottish team captain.
We have obviously got the English worried. The English Rugby Union
have ruled that the Lothian and Borders Police pipe band will not be on
hand to give rousing musical support as they did at Paris. Instead, we
will be treated to a dinky and subdued rendition of Flower of Scotland
by the Royal Marines band.
Retaliation is in order. Courtesy of Duncan J. Ferguson of Plockton
High School, we have the words of our anthem in the Gaelic. We must no
longer hate the English but we can still confuse them with:
O Flur na h-Alba, cait' am faighte do shamhail a rithis?
Rinn cath 's a bhasaich a' dion do sgoid de'n tir,
'S a sheas an aghaidh armachd Shasainn
'S a thill iad dhachaidh le smaointean trom.
Unfortunately, I will not be at Twickenham singing in either English
or Gaelic. The daughter has chosen today to be married and apparently
needs me on hand as giver-away and bearer of the purse.
The wedding kicks off at the same time as the match. Even worse, she
has chosen that song about the feet in ancient times as one of the
hymns.

GARDEN centres in Scotland stand to lose thousands of pounds on their
busiest day of the year because Gardening Which? has erred, writes BRIAN
McGLONE.
The April issue -- going out now -- says that ''most garden centres
are expected to be shut'' on Easter Sunday because of the 1994 Sunday
Trading Act.
But this does not apply to Scotland -- a fact Which? has overlooked.
Said Karen Johnston of Dobbie &amp; Co in Edinburgh, one of Scotland's
leading garden centres: ''This could hit us hard. We have a wide range
of Easter items like roses, Kilmarnock willows, and alpines which would
be major sellers. It's appalling that Which? has made this sweeping
assumption that what goes for England goes for Scotland as well, and it
ought to be corrected.''
The only consolation is that Easter visitors from across the Border
may bring extra trade if they spot that Scottish garden centres are
open.
Gardening Which? apologised last night for ''any confusion we've
caused''. Said press officer Simon Morrison: ''We thought people would
realise the new Act applied only to England and Wales. We're very sorry
it is not clear and has upset people in Scotland.''

A NEW tide of activity is lapping around Carrick Quay, the dramatic
development of luxury apartments overlooking the Clyde in the centre of
Glasgow. Paisley-based builders Clarke Homes say that they have a
waiting list of people interested in the 18 two-bedroom apartments and
four three-bedroom penthouses which will be completed later this year.
''Workmen are busy completing the fit-out of the 22 units and the
first show apartment is scheduled to be completed and open to public
inspection around Easter,'' says regional director Steve Phillips.
''If the present high level of interest is maintained it will augur
well, not only for this particular phase of the development but also for
the planned extension which is in the pipeline.
The project originally envisaged just under 100 luxury apartments,
maisonettes and penthouses, but further development was postponed during
the property slump.

SCOTLAND flanker Rob Wainwright is hoping that this year the Calcutta
Cup will be the cup that cheers.
Last season at Murrayfield, in a game when Scotland hopes were dashed
15-14 courtesy of the final-second penalty goal by England's Jon
Callard, the Army doctor was on an emotional roller coaster in which he
scored a try and then went off injured.
Wainwright's jaw was broken in a collision with team-mate Peter
Walton, and he watched from the touchline as Gregor Townsend's dropped
goal seemed to have secured victory for the Scots, only to see Callard's
soaring penalty dash Scottish hopes and leave captain Gavin Hastings in
tears.
''Yes, that was pretty miserable,'' he said. ''It looked like we had
it in the bag and then Callard put over that kick. Another try on
Saturday would do me nicely, but we can do without all the rest.''
Tomorrow will be Wainwright's first visit to Twickenham in Scottish
colours. However, he is no stranger to RFU HQ. Between 1986 and '88 he
played three times for Cambridge University in the Varsity match,
winning once in '87.
The former pupil of Glenalmond, the Alma Mater, too, of 1990 Grand
Slam captain David Sole, was named captain of Scotland's touring squad
to Argentina last summer, but a hamstring injury sustained just a few
days before departure denied him the chance to lead the Scots overseas.
Nevertheless, he is expected to assume the captain's mantle when Gavin
Hastings retires, possibly after this summer's World Cup.
At Twickenham tomorrow, Wainwright and his back-row colleagues, Iain
Morrison and Eric Peters, have a crucial role to play. It will be their
primary responsibility to nullify the destructive threat posed by their
English counterparts, Rodber, Richards, and Clarke.
The English trio, weighing a collective 51 stones and standing 6ft
7in, 6ft 5in, and 6ft 4in, bring height and power but suspect pace to
the loose-forward exchanges. The more nimble Scots, conceding height and
more than a stone a man to the enemy, will endeavour to sink English
offensive intentions before they can get up a head of steam.
Wainwright declares: ''The English back-row have been built up by the
media as being invincible. They're good right enough, but no player is
invincible. There isn't a player alive who is so good that he can't be
beaten.
''It's going to be our job to knock them back at the earliest
opportunity. The first tackles have got to count. England have found
holes in other sides because they've let Rodber, Clarke, and Richards
break through the first couple of tackles. Once they've done that they
then draw in more of the defence and suddenly you've got big problems.
If you can knock them back first time then they're not nearly so
effective. There are going to be some big hits going in.''
Neither does Wainwright expect the Scottish side to be intimidated by
the massed ranks of England supporters. With a ticket allocation of only
4800, Scottish fans will be vastly outnumbered in the 60,000-seat
Twickenham ground.
''Crowds are only intimidating if you let them,'' said Wainwright.
''If you don't give them anything to cheer about then they become
superfluous to the proceedings. If the English crowd don't get anything
to be excited about then home advantage is cancelled.''
Yesterday, just hours before the Scots flew south, Wainwright, who
lists his hobbies as fishing, photography and, interestingly, whisky was
out with his rod on the River Almond on the outskirts of Edinburgh. With
size 13 feet, waders have always been a problem, but the Dumfries-based
firm which manufacturers the countryman's famous green wellies stepped
in with a pair of custom-built chest-waders.
Wainwright was accompanied by fellow-fisherman Kenny Milne. The
Scotland hooker, who tomorrow wins his thirty-sixth cap, will be
renewing his career-long battle with England's Brian Moore.
The combative Englishman is not everyone's cup of tea, but Milne
maintains that, off the field, they are the best of pals. ''There are no
worries there. We're actually quite friendly,'' says Milne.
Milne, a survivor from the 1990 Grand Slam side, is making his fourth
visit to Twickenham and has only the draw in 1989 to show for his
troubles. ''I don't believe in hoodoo grounds. Our preparations have
gone really well and we're confident that we'll give a good account of
ourselves.
''I was more nervous before the game in 1990, but that was early on in
my international career. People have gone on about the hype surrounding
this game and the one five years ago, but the players try to detach
themselves from that.
''Personally, my preparation is always the same. It doesn't matter to
me whether I'm playing for Scotland against Western Samoa or Romania or
against England for the Grand Slam. Every time, I aim to do my utmost
for my country.
''That has always been the Scottish way and that's what we'll all be
doing against England on Saturday.''

DRIVERS whizzing round Bearsden's Canniesburn Toll might not realise
it but hidden away from the main road is a charming hamlet which dates
back some 200 years.
One of the four cottages in the little square is now for sale. The
existing owner has occupied the house for five years and and has
extended and remodelled the cottage to provide comfortable accommodation
in three main apartments.
The inside of the house has been virtually re-built -- upgrading works
include rewiring and replumbing, a rear extension with pitched roof,
replacement windows, a completely re-fitted kitchen with appliances, two
newly fitted bathrooms, and a gas central heating system.
All rooms of the rooms have contrasting wall coverings, hardwood
architraves, original beamed ceilings, and carpeting.
The courtyard to the front of the property is communally shared with
the three other occupants within the square, there is a further parking
area to the rear. Flower beds run along the front of the cottage, while
to the rear there is a private paved patio.
Offers over #79,500 are invited to Clyde Properties.

SCOTLAND and England meet in the deciding match of the home
international championship in Nottingham today, the Scots having beaten
Wales 143-90, with England 123-100 victors against Ireland.
The Scots were in fine form with all six rinks finishing ahead.
Showing the way was Alex Marshall who took an early grip on
proceedings in his match with Phil Rowlands, before going on to win
29-11. Robert Provan beat Mike Prosser 26-14, Willie Wood weighed in
with a 26-15 success against Robert Weale, while Robert McCulloch beat
Jason Greenslade 19-11.
Scotland completed their whitewash when Richard Corsie and Angus Blair
added two-shot wins over John Price and Stephen Rees.
England produced a solid performance against Ireland, finishing in
front on four rinks, all square in one, and down in the other.
Top scorers were David Ward and Gary Smith, 10-shot victors over Roy
McCune and Gary McCloy. Ireland's consolation win came from David
Corkill who beat Wynne Richards 19-13.

ENGLAND'S Tony Underwood has enjoyed himself so far this season, and
he approaches tomorrow's match against Scotland at Twickenham with his
status growing with every game.
''Of course, it's gone well for me and England in these last few
months,'' he said. ''The ball has run to my right wing and in Dublin, I
was coming through on Rory's side to score one of our tries.''
Until recently most references to Tony had the addition: ''Rory's
brother,'' but now they are the Underwood brothers. ''I had a tentative
start against Romania in November,'' said Tony, ''but I got a couple of
tries later on.
''There was another against Canada and the effort in Ireland. It got
better. I was street-wise enough to give Philippe Saint-Andre a nudge
when he tried to block me from touching down Rob Andrew's kick when we
played France last month. He tried to touch down, but I scored the try.
''But running as fast as I could down the touchline for the second try
against France was the highlight.
''Receiving a pass and sprinting for the corner is what wings dream
about and there I was clinching another England win.''
Tony has been dropped twice -- once for his brother, who has never
endured such selectoral disapproval. He said: ''I was disappointed to be
left out last year, but when I analysed my play, I realised that my
standards could be higher. So harder work began.''
Tony's kicking is the best from an England wing since the days of Mike
Slemen. Tomorrow another aspect of his all-round game will be
scrutinised by the Scots. Every team so far in this Five Nations'
Championship has threatened to make England fullback Mike Catt's
afternoon a nightmare with high kicks.
No team has done so yet, but Craig Chalmers and Gavin Hastings will
probably test him more thoroughly than the recent opposition, and this
is where the Underwood brothers come in.
''Nowadays the full back and the wings operate as a unit in defence,''
said Tony. ''We are referred to as the back three. So, we frequently
practise sweeping up when the ball is kicked at the full back or one of
the wings.
''We talk about it and have anybody kicking the ball downfield at us
in practice. We have done everything we can to ensure that we can cope
when the Twickenham sky starts raining rugby balls.''

SCOTTISHPOWER is celebrating St Patrick's Day with its first ever
order from outside the UK.
The company has won a contract to build and operate a 15-megawatt
windfarm in the north west of Eire, at Barnsmore in County Donegal, as
part of the Dublin Government's alternative energy requirement.
SccottishPower's first windfarm, in mid-Wales, generates 40 megawatts
and is the biggest in Europe.
The company already operates two windfarms in Northern Ireland, with a
third due to start generating this month.

I HAVE a sneaking regard for Mr Kenneth Clarke. In this age of
designer-suited politicos, when the presentational imperative is to have
your colours done, airbrush your policies, restock your wardrobe and be
coached into a state of anodyne soundbite defiance, fending off the most
insistent interrogator, the Chancellor of the Exchequer still looks as
if he sleeps in his suit, wobbles unhealthily over his belt, and
occasionally blurts out the truth as he sees it.
Careless Ken was at it again this week. His cavalier disregard for the
finer details of the world around him -- heaping praise on that Consett
steelworks, blythly unaware that it had closed down in 1980; then
commending a disposable nappy factory in the same town, which went out
of business in 1991 -- is reprehensible in one responsible for putting
flesh on Britain's fiscal regime. But I can't help liking Clarke in his
more candid moments, the would-be man of the people trying to fathom the
public mood.
He was being recklessly candid this week. People will not feel more
secure or more comfortable until the recovery has been under way for
another couple of years, at least, he told his BBC interviewer, on
Wednesday. Whether the Chancellor then went on to predict that the
feel-good factor will be notable by its elusive absence until the new
millennium dawns, is now the subject of hotly-disputed textual
nitpicking.
Yet, within 24 hours, Clarke was compounding his warning. Yesterday
morning he was on the radio again, acknowledging: ''But people listening
to me know . . . it is still hard work in business. They know . . . we
have a long way to go before we become a really successful industrial
economy again.''
For indulging in such patent honesty, the Chancellor is now being
blugeoned from all sides. The opposition parties think they have him on
toast, admitting, in effect, the failure of his own economic policies.
Clarke's enemies in his own party see this is as an opportunity to
scupper his leadership ambitions for good. Some see a large secondary
bonus in the chance to mug the principal Cabinet proponent of closer
European integration.
I'm not in a position to know whether Clarke was being casual,
careless or frankly cautionary about our economic prospects. But the
response to his comments -- in its southern editions the true-blue Daily
Express ran the front page headline ''Feel-good gaffe on a day of
economic joy'' -- is a revelation.
The Chancellor was telling it as it almost certainly is. In our third
year of economic recovery, the public mood in the UK is still painfully
cautious. Whether you believe the latest monthly CBI distributive trends
survey (''uneven trading conditions'', said Scottish director Lex Gold)
or the Government's own retail sales figure published the next day (up
1.2% on the month), High Streets remain, on any longer-range measure,
stubbornly subdued.
The official claimant count of the unemployed fell again last month.
But there are still more than 2,300,000 of us officially without a job.
And the number of people leaving the dole queues in February was the
smallest for more than two years. Notified vacancies fell for the third
month running. Average earnings growth fell from the the 3.75% recorded
in each of the previous seven months to 3.5%.
If all that adds up to a day of joy in the Express lexicon, who knows
how they'll describe the day, if it ever dawns, when the warm
feeling-good glow really floods back. The official numbers, of course,
only tell a fragment of the full story.
They do not pick up the impact on morale of the casualisation of work
for more and more of those still in a job. They are but a proxy measure
for our individual responses to the hefty new tax hikes imposed by
Clarke and his predecessor, Norman Lamont or the three interest-rate
rises since September.
They imperfectly distill the impact of stress in the workforce,
negative equity in a depressed housing market or worry in the home about
where the next generation's jobs are coming from.
This recovery is export-led. So it should be with sterling's effective
devaluation of some 20% against the German mark since we exited the ERM.
But some 72% of Scotland's total manufactured exports are concentrated
in just three sectors -- electronics, chemicals and whisky.
If booming business makes workers feel better about their own
prospects, that's where the main impact should be felt. But electronics
is in the forefront of casualising its labour force to match the demand
cycle. And the competitive pressures in that sector are so intense, the
technology so fast-moving, and the margins so painfully thin, that no
sane person would bet on the longer-term future of some parts of Silicon
Glen.
Whisky is an industry where fiscal discrimination at home and abroad
and changing tastes, habits and lifestyles among drinkers are also
casting a cloud. If there are reasons to be downbeat in two of
Scotland's three big export sectors, is it any wonder that the feel-good
factor is barely registering elsewhere?
For my money, Ken Clarke hit the nail on the head this week. He and
his Government must shoulder a large share of the blame for the current
popular mood. But it's refreshing to hear a senior politician diagnose
the problem with such candour.
The shrill chorus of condemnation from within his own party and from
sections of the media was in direct proportion to the accuracy of his
message. But if, as the Chancellor now admits, the return of a sense of
economic wellbeing is at least two years away, will Ken Clarke now
resist the pressure to manufacture a solution, a contrived tax giveaway
in time for the next election?
Perhaps even he accepts that, in the public's current cynical mood,
the days of buying votes are fast slipping away. But is he big enough to
resist the pressures to give it a try anyway?

THE bigger of Scotland's two electricity companies, ScottishPower, is
contemplating an acquisition in the utility sector and is looking more
closely at expansion opportunities overseas, according to its new chief
executive Ian Robinson.
After two weeks in post, the 52-year-old recruit from Trafalgar House
is bullish about the company's prospects, despite its languishing share
price. ''We are opportunity rich,'' said ScottishPower's finance
director Ian Russell, who joined 11 months ago from conglomerate
Tomkins.
The pair point out that theirs is the only company free of the
regulatory stramash affecting the 12 English and Welsh RECs.
Hydro-Electric has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission after refusing to accept the regulator's September
distribution review. And the two English generators are under
instructions to dispose of some power stations.
Mr Russell confirmed that ScottishPower had run its rule over Northern
Electric, following the original bid from Trafalgar but had decided not
to get involved in a competitive situation.
But, with a strong balance sheet and positive cash flow from its core
activities, SP is actively assessing other acquisition opportunities.
''It will probably be in the utilities. That's the kind of business we
understand,'' said Mr Robinson.
There will be no rush to buy, but Scottish is already assessing
opportunities in the 6000 megawatts of generating capacity to be shed by
National Power and PowerGen by the end of this year, under the
regulator's instructions. But the price will have to be right.
Scottish still sees the upgrading of the interconnector with the south
as the major vehicle for maximising the use of its own coal-fired
stations and is quietly optimistic about the outcome of the planning
inquiry into the proposed grid link with North Ireland.
But opportunities to buy whole supply businesses in England and local
generating capacity which could help supply it will be actively
considered.
Until recently ScottishPower was reluctant to consider overseas
expansion. But the outgoing chief executive Dr Ian Preston signalled a
change of attitude at the interim results and Mr Robinson confirmed that
opportunities in overseas markets are now being actively considered.
The acquisition of the Clydesdale retail stores and a distribution hub
in northern England, for a bargain basement #16m, is regarded as a
successful coup. ''The business is making money,'' said Mr Russell,
''because we are offering the public the kind of service it wants.''
The utility's new telecoms business will require significant further
investment but is already picking up valuable customers. The gas
business, Caledonian Gas, has a valuable competitive edge over its
rivals.
The Scottish Power executives remain unconvinced that government will
privatise Scottish Nuclear, the source of most of their baseload
electricity. But they are looking forward to the progressive unwinding
of the price terms in the must-take supply contract, which will take the
price paid to around 80% of the English pool price in 1998.

GREENOCK-based British Polythene Industries is paying IR#900,000 for
the business and some of the trading assets of Irish company Globophan
Industries.
The business, which specialises in flexible packaging for the retail
and commercial sectors, will continue to trade from its base in Ireland
under the name Globophan Packaging.
BPI, which is not assuming any of Globophan's existing borrowings,
plans to use its manufacturing muscle to expand the Irish firm.

IT WAS 9.35 on a Friday night and I was passing by in a taxi, just at
douce Cathcart on the South-side of Glasgow and there it was: the
unacceptable face of women.
There were three of the hags, each of the size required for military
service, each shaven-headed enough to go to court for unfair dismissal,
each sufficiently energetic to get stuck into any activity save sexual
intercourse unless it was with each other. And all three were
enthusiastically tearing strips off a large poster on a billboard. I
then knew what the vandalised posters throughout Scotland were all
about.
The poster was an advertisement for a film titled Pret-a-Porter. The
ad shows a very nice looking girl clad in not very much except a pair of
wonderfully evocative black stockings. She has got a bare bum, but you
only really see the curve of it. But she looks very nice anyway.
Reminds one a little of that lovely painting of the Irish courtesan
Miss O'Shea by the French artist Boucher, a work of art indeed. A nicely
rounded little pink bottom and a happy curl to her rose-leaf lips. Miss
O'Shea goes down the ages. I defy any decent male to view the painting
and not manage a stirring in the loins, and a sudden burst of gaiety to
the brain cells.
If I am not mistaken the poster designers had Miss O'Shea in mind, and
maybe the chocolate-box master of innocent erotica of 1950s master,
Vargas, when they thought up this advert for a film which is all about
fashion and models, including the one they have in the scud, or near it,
a Helena Christiansen.
But the female visigoths were out ripping shreds off the picture.
Doubtless they will be off to the Louvre throwing acid over the late
Miss O'Shea's rounded rump. Next they will be taking sledgehammers to
the three graces bums and pudendas.
They have their doubts too about another ad for another movie.
Disclosure is a film in which Kirk Douglas's boy gets sexually harassed
by a stunning lassie called Demi Moore. I would be demi-deid if Ms
Moore's ministrations were to be perpetrated upon my person, and in fact
the very notion will keep me in fantasies for weeks.
There is not much chance of me fantasising over the fat slags I saw
prancing about at half past thirty-five of a Friday night, and one
cannot help but think that when normal girls are about at such a time at
the weekend they would be busier getting chatted up by someone like
Michael Douglas, or as near as they can manage, than worrying about
beautiful girls in black stockings and hardly-seen bare arses. I mean if
I was a girl I'd rather want to look as nice as that anyway. Most girls
do.
They seem to, anyway, if the mags are anything to go by. Have you ever
seen women's magazines? They should be put on top shelves in newsagents,
or under the counter in brown paper. You never saw such porn. Women's
mags are packed with bare botties, and lacy knickers, and slips, and
girls caressing their breasts. Women's magazines are the very berries
for the male voyeur.
Hard-core porn is for chaps with very low IQs. Women's mags are for
sauve, sophisticated lechers like male readers of this blatt -- well,
certainly me anyway. Maybe the older lads like Webster or Hunter have
forgot the enticement of a scanty pair of bloomers, but your Urban V has
them in his sights.
But normal women are normal. The younger women certainly find the
antics of the collection of Cell Block H harridans quite inexplicable.
What they also seem to find without an explanation is why men get such a
very difficult time.
I have been beleaguered for many years because of my sticky-out bit by
a half percentage of the female species. Every time I witness an
exhortation not to hit women -- Zero Tolerance -- it occurs to me that I
never hit one anyway.
Every time a radio programme informs me that I was a bully as a boss
and upset the ladies who were bossed about by me it occurs as well that
I was never a boss in my life, but had several bints who were mine and
not much fun it was. A Miss Alexander, I remember, sacked me as a clerk
in the Glasgow Corporation Sewage Works Department. The only shit I ever
saw was, in fact, Miss Alexander.
Mind you, Miss Alexander wouldn't have figured in my dreams, and
certainly not in any ad with black stockings and an arc of a bare wee
fundament. Miss Alexander would have been ideal for the vandals who tore
up posters and my dreams. I am glad though that at 9.40 on a Friday
night, I had long forgotten the mad feminists. I was too busy getting
chatted up by Tracy. A normal lassie at that.

A BIT of bad news for St Patrick on the very day we are celebrating
Scotland's most famous Irishman. It appears that there may not be room
for the ould fella on the coat of arms of the new Dumbarton and
Clydebank Council.
St Pat features on the insignia of the current Clydebank District
Council. But he is likely to replaced by an elephant and castle from
Dumbarton's crest when the two councils merge next year. (We didn't even
know there was a pub called the Elephant and Castle in Dumbarton.)
Old Kilpatrick, believed increasingly by historians to have been St
Patrick's birthplace 1500 years ago, straddles the boundary between the
two existing authorities' areas.
Legend has it that the saint was the son of a decurio, an
administrator responsible for paying the wages of Roman legionaries
stationed in fortresses between the Antonine Wall, Duntocher -- the
golden fort -- and Dumbarton Rock.
As a teenager, he fished on the banks of the Clyde at Dunglass near
Bowling and it was from there he was kidnapped and taken to Ulster and
sold as a slave. Anyway, all that is history. Which is what St Patrick
will be, coat-of-arms-wise, unless there is a change of heart down
Dumbarton way.
Brow beaten
THE BBC is making the news these days with the cutbacks in
programme-making craft trades such as make-up, design and costume
departments. Thus Mr Andy Davy, BBC Scotland's head of resources (aka
the Mad Axeman) had to be interviewed by Reporting Scotland, in the
programme's role as impartial source of news to the nation.
Mr Davy was a bit nervous about being on the telly, as most people
would be. In fact, there was a hint of perspiration on the brow. No
problem, easily dealt with by a touch of make-up. Well, perhaps not.
Crisp answer
WE are in receipt of a copy of a letter sent out by Tayside region
educational development service department on the subject of a schools
band competition which took place last weekend.
The bit which our reader underlined for our attention reads:
''Following Tayside region's health-and-safety guidelines, it has been
decided not to provide filled rolls or sandwiches on the day. Crisps,
chocolate, soft drinks, etc will be on sale . . .''
We meant, honestly, to get in touch with the author of the letter, Mr
Charles L Maynes, Tayside's co-ordinator of musical activities. But his
phone was busy, then he had gone for the day. If we had got hold of him,
he would proably have told us some perfectly good reasons why Tayside
region's health-and-safety guidelines prohibit the consumption of
sandwiches and filled rolls.
We prefer to imagine our own reasons. There will be no filled rolls in
Tayside schools because:
* They want the kids to eat cake.
* In Tayside a sandwich equals instant death from salmonella or
botulism.
* They will eat Wallace's pies and like it.
* Tayside children have too many teeth and must be encouraged to
consume more chocolate and soft drinks.
On the move
THE TV Times recently told readers of a programme in the Cracking
Stories series which looked at the chaotic first week in the life of
Isles FM ''the community radio station based in Stornoway on the Isle of
Skye''.
After hoors
WRONG again. Mrs Lyndsey Hay of the Gallowgate, Glasgow, writes to say
that our version of the colourful phrase on the passage of time --
''Hauf-past 10 an' no' a hoor in the hoose dressed'' -- is inaccurate.
The original she says, is of Liverpudlian origin and goes: ''It's 7pm,
street full of sailors, and not a whore in the house painted.''
Bill McDougall of Bishopton recalls that in days of yore at Paisley
post office, a postal inspector used to assemble his staff of posties as
soon as they had clocked on for duty at 5am and address them thus:
''Right, you lot. The day after the morn it'll be the middle o' the week
and yiz huvnae done a haun's turn yet.''
Prodi stands
NAME Game: Our thanks to the many readers who have brought it to our
attention that a certain politician called Roman Prodi is standing as
prime minister in Italy.
Out of step
DEPT of We Know What She Meant: The Government has announced that it
is finally to ban the export of land mines, which have caused millions
of deaths all over the world. Ann Clwyd, Labour MP and campaigner for
such a ban, said: ''It's a step in the right direction.''
Last chance
DEFINITELY your last chance to enter the great Famous Grouse Grand
Slam competition -- prizes a rugby shirt and a ball signed by the
Scotland XV. We're fed up setting questions, so all you have to do this
time is write your name and address on a postcard or sealed-down
envelope, send it in to the usual address, and we'll put all the entries
in the bin. Sorry, a bin. Then we'll pick two winners.
The answer to yesterday's question -- Who played David Sole's partner
in the series Starsky and Hutch? -- is, of course, Princess Anne.
