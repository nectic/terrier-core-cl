As winter begins to bite in the North, Kenny Taylor gets into full
swing: he appears to walk up the pole as he earths the line at Torphins,
Kincardineshire. The 39-year-old from Stonehaven is a ''craftsman --
overhead lines'' or linesman, and for 20 years has helped maintain power
to thousands west from the Mearns to the Cairngorm Mountains and north
to the outskirts of Aberdeen. The blizzard season heralds his busiest
time of the year, as gales, snow, and ice hit the cables.

''IT'S my favourite room in the house,'' says Elaine Stevenson opening
the door to her kitchen.
Only those chained reluctantly to a hot stove could fail to be
similarly affected by the kitchen at No.5 Palmer Crescent, in
Strathaven.
Not that it is awash with state-of-the-art gadgetry, but the
proportions and the simple practicality of the room would surely make it
a pleasure to work in.
Above all the kitchen, like much of the rest of the house, is well
lit, a consideration that too many home owners ignore when they furnish.
Thanks to Ronnie Stevenson, who works for an electrical company, there
are plenty of well placed, low voltage spot lights above work surfaces,
instantly banishing any gloomy corners.
The fitted cupboards, the hob and extractor hood, are all white and
there is a beautiful white ceramic floor with blue diamond-shaped
insets. Worktops are in a speckled grey finish and the pale painted
walls of the breakfast area have just a hint of blue, making the room
fresh and stylish.
The large utility room beyond has plenty of space for a washing
machine and a fitted sink, while the ceramic floor and white units are
continued throughout.
A door leads through into the integral garage, which Elaine says is
ideal for extra storage or unpacking shopping from the car in bad
weather.
The house was built just two and a half years ago and the Stevensons
had planned to add a conservatory soon, but a change in work plans means
they will be moving to Ireland next year.
Their home is just as they bought it, apart from pretty decorative
effects like the stencilled friezes of stars and moons in the bathroom.
Downstairs, the plain blue carpet leads from the open glass porch
through to the comfortable television room and the large open-plan
sitting room and dining room.
The dining room can be separated by a glazed door and it has patio
doors out into the garden. All the woodwork around the double-glazed
windows is in natural timber.
There is a useful downstairs cloakroom, which Elaine has decorated in
a rich blue stippled paper to match the carpets.
Upstairs, the four bedrooms open off a central landing and all of them
can easily be called doubles. The main bedroom has a fitted wardrobe
with glass doors and its own en-suite shower room.
While the bedroom walls are plain and unfussy with a simple but pretty
stencilled frieze, Elaine has given the shower room a plum pink,
stippled paper to tone perfectly with the pale grey fixtures.
The white venitian blind is typical of Elaine's decided view of simple
but fresh interiors, and she admits she is a real devotee of blue and
white.
No suprise then to find a white suite in the bathroom along with a
bright blue window blind dotted with stars and moons that she made
herself.
Outside, the house looks over its own good-size gardens in a quiet
corner of Strathaven. The crescent is part of a small, secluded
development which even has decorative terracotta bricks on the roadway.
Elaine would probably prefer blue, but for visitors it's the next best
thing to rolling out the red carpet.

IN the bleak midwinter, your own place in the sun begins to sound very
attractive. Stewart Milne Homes has opened a new showhome at its
Sunnyside Grove development in Drumoak, Lower Deeside, some three miles
from Peterculter.
Surrounded by countryside, Sunnyside Grove occupies a sloping site
with a sunny southern aspect. A small development, it is close to the
primary school and other local amenities.
The new Grosvenor showhome reflects the country location of Sunnyside
Grove. It has a traditional theme incorporating warm colours, natural
fabrics and extensive use of oak furniture.
The four-bedroom detached bungalow is one of three house styles
currently available at Sunnyside Grove. When completed, the scheme will
consist of 15 homes.
As well as four bedrooms, all offer en-suite facilities, separate
utility rooms, fitted wardrobes , double glazing, gas central heating,
double garages and large private gardens front and rear.
Other features, such as chimneys for open fires, bay windows, and
other architectural details add to the aesthetic appeal of individual
homes and the development as a whole.
Inside, there's a split-level lounge and formal dining area with a
number of features such as living-flame gas fire and patio doors leading
into the rear garden.
The kitchen is open-plan with the family room. All four bedrooms have
fitted wardrobes while the main bedroom has en-suite facilities.

A #1m contract for the development of a range of special homes in
Inverness has ben completed by builders Hugh MacRae &amp; Company.
The scheme is a joint venture between Albyn Housing Society and Key
Housing Association and is the latest in a number of similar
developments undertaken by Inverness-based MacRae. It was completed in
under 11 months, some four weeks ahead of programme.
Based on the site of the former Co-operative store on Montagu Row,
Inverness, Key Housing Association has eight residential homes with
24-hour support for adults with learning difficulties. Part of the
development includes specially adapted accommodation for wheelchair
users.
A further eight homes, for Albyn Housing Association, includes one
unit which is adapted for residents' own specifications.
The properties combine residential care units with rented
accommodation and shared ownership. The project also involved Highland
Regional Council, Highland Health Board, and Scottish Homes.

IT'S a familiar story. You buy a big house to accommodate the family:
they grow up and move away, and you find yourself with perhaps the
biggest asset of your life -- but you are on your own, and the house is
too big for one person to manage.
Lots of retired people face the same dilemma. The family home is all
they have left, and though they don't want to sell it, to be realistic,
it is just not economical for one person to live in and it can be quite
lonely.
Quality Street, Britain's largest provider of quality rented homes,
has launched an initiative to assist home owners in this position.
Retired people who rent a new home from Quality Street can now have
their original family home rented and managed for them under the
company's scheme, thus gaining them valuable income.
Chairman Paul Mugnioni, said: ''Although many people are keen to live
in one of our retirement apartments, they are still reluctant to sell
the family house. I believe this new plan will allay their fears.''
Quality Street has more than 300 furnished and unfurnished retirement
apartments for rent, stretching from the West of Scotland to the South
of England. Rents range from #350 a month for a one-bedroom apartment,
up to #450 for two bedrooms.
The typical retirement development includes facilities such as a
communal residents' lounge, where social events can be organised and
visitors received. Guest rooms with en-suite facilities are available
for overnight visitors, which allows independent minded tenants to
retain their privacy when company calls.
The vast majority have a resident house manager, who is there to help
residents make the most of their retirement.
All of the properties provide a 24-hour emergency service supported by
a central alarm system, regular window cleaning, landscaped gardens and
private parking. Service and maintenance teams are on hand to keep each
development in prime condition and all apartments come with carpets and
curtains, fully equipped kitchens complete with oven, hob and fridge,
bathroom with electric shower and bedrooms with fitted wardrobes.
Quality Street claims to offer its retired clients a very flexible
package. After three months, should they wish to move out, only one
month's notice is required. If they wish, they can move to any of
Quality Street's retirement developments around the country.

RANGERS might have to go into tonight's Old Firm match without their
top strike force of Ally McCoist and Mark Hateley, but Celtic also have
problems so serious that manager Tommy Burns may be forced to use at
least four of what he calls his ''younger brigade''.
Burns has been relying heavily on emerging players recently, and
yesterday he had little choice but to promote Jim Slavin, who will be 20
in a fortnight, into the Ibrox-bound squad as the first-team regulars
began to succumb to injury and illness.
Tosh McKinlay and Mark McNally are doubtful because of knocks and
Peter Grant, who scored the first of the two goals against Falkirk on
Saturday which brought to an end Celtic's embarrassing run of games
without a win, had to be sent home suffering from swollen glands. Also,
Tony Mowbray can't be considered for some time because of the death of
his wife, Bernadette, on New Year's Day.
''There is no point in worrying about it, but I'll have to put the
kids in,'' said Burns, who is continuing his search for fresh talent,
and has been looking closely at two players in Holland, a couple in
Spain, two south of the Border and two more in Scotland. ''I hope to get
some of them over here soon because we are in a hurry.''
Although he has an interest in two players in England, Burns is
unlikely to shop there because he feels that the market is over-priced.
''A #1m player is what you have to pay for day-to-day stuff,'' he said.
Even if Celtic should put their troubles behind them and beat Rangers
in tonight's match, which will be televised live on Sky, Burns would not
ease off in his quest to improve the playing standards. ''However,
winning at Ibrox would be helpful because of the opposition,'' he said.
''It would give us a great boost as well as three more points.''
Failure, though, would leave Celtic trailing 20 points behind Rangers,
who appear destined to win seven premier division championships in a
row. ''Yes the gap hurts. It hurts a lot,'' Burns said.
''But we have to look at this game as a way of reducing the difference
to 14 points. If we were to believe there was nothing we could do about
our situation, we would be afraid to get out of our beds in the
mornings.
''We have to look at our situation, find the positive things, and use
them. This is another game, albeit a big one, and it is another
opportunity for the younger brigade to go into the first team and show
what they can do for us.
''They are mostly around the 20 to 21-year-old mark and they can't
stay young players for ever.''
Apart from Slavin, the manager has been using Chris Hay, Brian
McLaughlin, Barry Smith, Simon Donnelly, and Stuart Gray. Only Donnelly
and Slavin didn't feature in last Saturday's side and, while it is
hardly ideal to tackle Rangers with inexperienced performers, Burns, who
was 19 when he made his Old Frim debut, was not too perturbed.
''It isn't ideal, but everyone should look at the game in a positive
way and I don't think there is a better place than Ibrox to be going at
this time,'' Burns stressed. ''The stadium is as good as any you will
find in Europe, and it has a great playing surface and atmosphere. It is
the place to be.''
His counterpart Walter Smith said that Hateley rather than McCoist is
the more likely to make the match, but decisions won't be made until
after both players have been checked out again today and reactions to
yesterday's training stints have been assessed. Smith has added Neil
Murray and Fraser Wishart to his squad and said: ''I will play Hateley
and McCoist only if they are fully fit. I won't be taking any risks.''
Smith becomes uneasy when mention is made of the lead Rangers have
opened up at the head of the premier division, and always tries to point
out that circumstances are strange because each win brings in three
points. ''You only have to have a run of draws with other teams
collecting maximum points and gaps can be closed quickly,'' he said.
In recent years, the away side in Old Firm matches have done better
than the home team, a phenomenon to which Smith has not yet found a key.
''I can't explain it,'' he says, ''but I do know that Celtic's
difficulties of late will make no difference in this game.
''In fact, both clubs have been trying to introduce new players and it
is always interesting to see how they cope.''
Laudrup's first attempt, back in August when Celtic won 2-0 at Ibrox,
was not especially good. In fact, he was largely anonymous, but he did
much better and scored one of the goals when Rangers beat Celtic 3-1 at
Parkhead and his recent form has been enough to alert Burns' players to
the danger.
If given any freedom at all, Laudrup could make the difference between
the teams, and Burns was certainly generous in his praise of the Danish
internationalist. ''A hell of a player,'' Burns said before adding: ''It
would be foolish to assign anyone to follow him around because he could
be kept quite for most of the match and then do something to win the
game.
''Also, we can't afford to believe that everything depends on keeping
Laudrup quiet, so there will be no special plans.''
Burns, like Smith, can only hope their players don't freeze as the
tension and passion generated by more than 40,000 supporters washes over
them. Often the bold rather than the skilful survive these contests, but
Rangers probably have too many of both types to be beaten in their own
backyard by Celtic for a second successive time.

Clark, who has been manager at Clyde, Cowdenbeath and Stranraer, is
chasing the vacant job at Arbroath after spending the last year in
charge of the junior club Shotts.
By coincidence his assistant, former Celtic and Scotland striker Frank
McGarvey, is also trying to step up. He is one of the applicants for the

IVAN Golac has had his say, Dundee United chairman Jim McLean has also
rushed into print, and yesterday one of the club's longest serving
players, Jim McInally, added to the air of despondency which is hanging
over Tannadice, pointing out that the club is in a state of turmoil.
''It is almost as though someone is trying to destroy it,'' he said.
The midfield player, who is in his ninth season with United, has grown
disillusioned despite his fondness for the supporters. McInally wants to
leave because he can no longer accept the regime into which Juan
Ferreira might be willing to move.
United are preparing to make a #250,000 offer for the 23-year-old
Uruguayan, who could be in Golac's side against Celtic at Hampden on
Saturday. The midfield player from Defensor played in a reserve match
against Hibernian yesterday and negotiations between United and the
South American club were expected to speed up.
Ferriera was at Tannadice for trials with a couple of other Uruguayan
players but they all returned home, although United maintained their
interest in Ferriera, who was married during the Christmas break. His
initial trial was a consequence of a trip McLean had made to Uruguay
last year.
While one may be coming in another, McInally, lives in the hope that
he will be able to move out or, in his case, escape. It isn't that he
has had enough of Golac, who seems destined to leave Tannadice shortly,
but McInally says he has become embittered by some of the practices at
Tannadice.
''Yes, I am bitter, and it won't change,'' he said, even though he had
been brought back from nowhere, which is precisely what reserve team
football is to the experienced professional.
McInally played against Aberdeen on Monday evening, and it was his
first appearance in the top side since October. He may play against
Celtic at Hampden on Saturday, but he would rather not. In fact, he
would rather be elsewhere, and his disappointment at not having been
allowed a transfer is almost tangible.
Motherwell recently offered #100,000, which Golac, who has been trying
to rebuild the squad, was prepared to accept, but the board declined the
fee. It is likely they would prefer to see McInally in the side, because
his tenacity and fighting qualities are lacking as United struggle to
translate their Scottish Cup form of last season into the league
programme.
Actually, they failed in that respect last season also, but winning
the cup for the first time in their history camouflaged the poverty of
their premier division play. This time, they have been so inconsistent
in their approach to business that no-one can fail to notice that there
are serious problems at Tannadice.
After the Aberdeen match, McLean tried to explain his position
regarding Golac, whose contract ends in May, but he could not give an
assurance that the manager would be offered a new one. That will happen
only if Golac manages to convince the board of directors that he is
astute in ''all aspects of his management,'' as McLean puts it.
It seems the decision has already been made and Golac will be
encouraged to move on, probably even more disillusioned than ever, but
current evidence suggests McInally will be held at Tannadice.
''The whole thing is a shock,'' said McInally. ''I've spoken twice at
board meetings and I had to tell the chairman to stop pointing at me and
calling me a liar.
''But I can't do much, because I have two years of a contract to run.
I am 30 now and the club have been offered #100,000 for me, but didn't
accept it.
''All I can hope for is that the board show me some humanity and allow
me to continue my career somewhere else.''
McInally has been a good and diligent servant to United since he
signed from Coventry City in May, 1986, the same day as Dave Bowman, who
also was taken from the same English club, yet the latter has been
offered a testimonial while McInally has not.
He would have played more often recently, but he finds it difficult to
put his problems to the back of his mind although, if the manager feels
he really needs him, then he will not refuse to pull on a jersey. ''I
will play because of my own pride as a professional footballer and
because the fans have been good to me,'' he said.
''If I am asked to play against Celtic I will, even though I don't
want to. I must fulfil the terms of my contract, and while I am saying
my heart isn't in it, I must play if asked.''

EDINBURGH'S popular residential area of Duddingston is the first
target of an Aberdeen-based builder's ambitious expansion plans.
A new #1.5m development will include 24 flats within a courtyard
setting, adjacent to the site of a former primary school at the junction
of Duddingston Road and Duddingston Mill Lane.
The developer behind the scheme is the Stewart Milne Group, Scotland's
fourth largest house-builder with a 25% share of the new homes market in
the north east.
The company says that the flats should appeal to second time
purchasers moving up the housing ladder and to retired couples looking
for a manageable home. Half of the flats will have their own individual
ground floor entrance.
Hamish Bethune, group board director responsible for residential
activities, said: ''This exciting new development will provide an
attractive living environment and is designed to relate to the existing
scenery.''
The specification of the flats includes white meter heating,
Scandinavian double glazed windows and comprehensively fitted kitchens
and bathrooms with co-ordinated ceramics.
A showhome is scheduled to open early in the year and the first homes
should be ready for occupation in spring.
Stewart Milne Homes is pursuing other opportunities in the central
belt, including the acquisition of further sites and the construction of
additional phases on existing developments.

BRIAN Hamilton, who would probably have played for Hibernian against
Hearts on Monday, is likely to be in the Tynecastle side when the
Edinburgh clubs play the re-scheduled derby match. The date will be
decided sometime today.
The 27-year-old midfield player, who played in the 4-0 win over Dundee
United last Saturday, moved out of contract last weekend and is unhappy
with the new terms offered at Easter Road.
Even though some of their supporters may be reluctant to welcome a
player from the traditional enemy into their ranks, Hearts were
interested when he became available and, if the clubs can agree terms he
will be signed immediately. A worker rather than a creator in midfield,
Hamilton obviously feels he would be able to make the transition while
many players steeped in the Edinburgh club traditions would baulk at the
prospect.
Hearts probably feel they need a midfield player because of the
uncertainty surrounding Jim Bett, who is operating on a month-to-month
basis.
There is likely to be a problem concerning the transfer fee, because
Hibs are believed to be seeking around #250,000 while Hearts valuation
would be closer to #150,000. The likelihood is the player will move and
the fee will be set by a tribunal.
Hamilton signed for Hibs for #270,000 in the summer of 1989, two years
after winning a Scottish Cup winners' medal with St Mirren. He is also a
former Scottish under-21 internationalist and was approaching his 200th
league appearance for the Easter Road club.

ROY Aitken is ready for a premier division return to cover Aberdeen's
defensive crisis.
The assistant manager was a surprise call-up as a substitute for
Stewart McKimmie when the captain was carried off in the New Firm derby
at Tannadice on Monday -- his first appearance for 15 months -- but with
McKimmie and former Norwich City defender Colin Woodthorpe both out,
Aitken is set to carry on to help Aberdeen's revival.
He said: ''As long as my legs can carry me I will play on if Willie
Miller wants me. I am 36 and not as fast as I was 10 years ago, but I
didn't have any problems against Dundee United.
''But my main role will still be on the management side.''

<TEXT>
ALEX Ferguson last night paid youngster Paul Scholes the perfect
compliment -- by comparing him with Manchester United legend Denis Law.
Scholes netted his sixth goal in his sixth start as United trimmed
Blackburn's lead in the Premiership to three points with a 2-0 win over
Coventry.
The United manager said: ''Paul has got six goals in six games so he
has got to be in the frame now. He wants to score goals -- his run for
his goal was brilliant. He got a goal that Denis Law used to get,
telling the keeper: 'If you drop it, I'm here.' It was a poacher's
goal.''
Frenchman Eric Cantona sealed victory with a penalty after 20-year-old
Scholes had been brought down by former Rangers defender Steve Pressley
-- who was sent off for a second bookable offence.
Coventry manager Phil Neal said: ''I'm very disappointed in Pressley,
having pointed out to him before the game not to do any silly tackles.''
Coventry captain Dion Dublin, back at Old Trafford for the first time
since his #2m departure, said of Pressley: ''He did two bad tackles and
deserved to go.''

<HEADLINE>NHS executives ignore pay limits with 6.6% average rise</HEADLINE>

THE controversy over executives' pay is fuelled further today with the
publication of a new study showing that at a time when public sector pay
settlements were limited to 1.5%, the earnings of NHS trust chief
executives grew by an average of 6.6%.
There were enormous variations around that average, from a reduction
of 4.1% to a rise of 27.8%, according to an analysis of the latest
accounts from 13 NHS trusts for the financial year ending March 31 last
year.
The Incomes Data Services Management Pay Review, published today, also
highlights ''the inadequate understanding of standard accounting
practices displayed by many trusts''.
IDS says that in a number of trusts, remuneration levels were
understated because some items, such as the value of taxable benefits,
were mistakenly excluded. After being contacted by IDS one trust
discovered it had ''inadvertently'' omitted from its accounts a #3700
perfomance bonus and #3200 of taxable benefits for its chief executive.
As at this time last year the availability and disclosure of
information on pay in the accounts ''left much to be desired'', says
IDS, which complains of many trusts ignoring requests for copies of the
accounts and most refusing to give out additional information.
The highest earning chief executive is at Central Manchester
Healthcare, where pay went up by 15.5% to #112,000 for a person who also
remains and continues to be paid as a medical consultant.
Only one other, Guy's and St Thomas, pays more than #100,000, while
another three pay more than #90,000 and a further seven pay #80,000 or
more. Aberdeen Royal Hospitals, which pays its chief executive #79,000,
is 13th in the pay league.
The bottom position is filled by Lincolnshire Ambulance trust which
pays its chief executive #41,000.
The report said much of the information in trust accounts was
incomplete and uninformative, despite the issuing of a new Department of
Health code of accountability.
Unison's head of health, Bob Abberley, said: ''This kind of private
greed at the public's expense will further undermine the already shaky
morale of health service staff whose pay has been held back by the
Government. It is a shameful indictment of the Government's
commercialisation of the Health Service.''

SCOTLAND'S Anne Gibson attended the first British Olympic badminton
squad camp training session of the New Year yesterday at High Wycombe as
a full member, but the London-based Scot will not be lining up at this
weekend's Wilson-Dunfermline Open.
Having spent the last three weeks without hitting a shuttle because of
a shoulder injury, Gibson felt it was too soon to compete, and decided
to concentrate instead on yesterday's trainging session, her first since
she was given her place in the squad.
''I have trained with them before,'' said Gibson, who has just begun
to exercise her shoulder through it's full range of movements in the
last few days.
''But now I will really feel a part of the squad, and will be able to
enjoy all the extra benefits that go with it.''
In the absence of Gibson, Gillian Martin, of Barnt Green, who won the
recent Scottish Invitation Singles Championship, and triple Scottish
champion Elinor Allen, of Edinburgh, instead will be favourites for the
women's title this weekend at the Bruce Street Hall venue.
Stirling University's Bruce Flockhart is firm favourite to take the
men's title and retain his grip on the Scottish rankings, being fresh
from a spell of training in Belgium, while defending champion David
Gilmour is still missing from the competitive line-up five months on
from the back injury which put him out of action at the Commonwealth
Games.
The long established partnerships of Russell Hogg and Kenny
Middlemiss, the Allen sisters, Jenny and Elinor, and Elinor and
Middlemiss are almost certain to lift the doubles titles and a share of
the #1000 total prize fund.

DARREN Gough received congratulations from fast bowling greats Harold
Larwood and Ray Lindwall yesterday.
Larwood, who is now 90, wrecked Australia's batting, taking 33 wickets
during the infamous ''bodyline'' series in 1932-33, while Lindwall, now
73, was the mainstay of Australia's attack in the 1940s and 50s, taking
228 wickets in 61 tests.
Larwood, who emigrated to Australia in the 1950s, telephoned Gough in
the England dressing room after the Yorkshireman six for 49 had helped
bowl Mark Taylor's side out for 116.
The 24-year-old Gough, who visited Larwood at his Sydney home last
month, said: ''It was a great surprise to hear from Harold and I was
delighted when he called to say well done''
Gough earned his wickets yesterday by bowling straight and to a
full-length. He said: ''Harold told me to pitch it up when we spoke, as
he said he had got 19 of his wickets clean-bowled.''
He joked: ''Harold also said that I was only the second fast bowler to
get a standing ovation for his batting at Sydney.'' Larwood got one when
he scored 98 in 1928-29.
Gough received a letter from Lindwall, which read: ''Well batted, well
bowled, a great effort. You will remember this match forever. Keep up
the good work and best wishes for the future.''
Gough rated his performance with the ball ahead of his batting the
previous day, saying: ''My first-five wicket haul in tests is a great
feeling. I'm now on Test cricket's honours board.''
Gough's belligerent approach has given England, 2-0 down in the
five-match series, a timely boost. ''We've all bowled well and I hope we
can do it again. If we can get some more runs on Wednesday and then have
them three or four down by the close, we should win.''
Gough, with 19 wickets in the series, now has 36 victims in only his
seventh Test.

A DRUG addict who is HIV positive was jailed yesterday after biting
his former girlfriend.
John Dowling attacked Ms Margaret McDonald, 33, on New Year's Day and
bit her on the neck.
Dowling, 30, of Calder Grove, Edinburgh, was sentenced to six months
at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He admitted assaulting Ms McDonald, 33, in her house in Wester Hailes,
punching her, pulling her hair, and biting her on the neck.
He also admitted committing an offence while on bail and breaching a
bail condition not to approach Ms McDonald.
The court heard that he started drinking at 10am on January 1, and
that, combined with drugs, made his behaviour very erratic.
He assaulted Ms McDonald in her bedroom then tried to follow her
downstairs but fell because he was so drunk.
Dowling's solicitor said he went to the house at the woman's
invitation only to collect some of his clothes.
He said he had found work as a labourer and had no previous
convictions for assault.
Sheriff Andrew Lothian jailed Dowling for three months for assault and
three months for the bail offences.

NEW Zealand off-spinner Shane Thomson captured three wickets in quick
succession to check South Africa as they threatened to take charge of
the third and final Test in Cape Town yesterday.
Thomson ended a first-wicket stand of 106, removing Rudolf Steyn and
Gary Kirsten before dismissing Daryll Cullinan to reduce South Africa to
125 for three. By the close of the second day, they were 152 without
further loss in reply to New Zealand's first innings of 288 in the
deciding game of the series, which is level 1-1.
Steyn and Kirsten provided an ideal start before Thomson's
introduction as he put the brakes on the scoring as well as making
inroads into the top order. Steyn was first to go after a promising
debut Test innings, being given lbw off Thomson for 38. Kirsten was then
bowled for 64 having hit nine 4s off 131 balls. Cullinan, who had made
five, was caught by Bryan Young at mid-wicket.
John Commins (22 not out) and captain Hansie Cronje (11 not out)
guided South Africa safely through the remainder of the day.
Earlier New Zealand extended their overnight 211 for six to 288 all
out having been 96 for five at one stage on the first day. Stephen
Fleming completed an excellent 79, hitting eleven 4s and sharing a
seventh-wicket stand of 66 with Matthew Hart (24).
Fleming was one of three victims during the morning for paceman Steven
Jack who ended with four for 69 while all-rounder Brian McMillan took
four for 65, both Test bests.

THE brother-sister combination of Andrei Medvedev and Natalia
Medvedeva earned Ukraine a slice of tennis history yesterday when they
beat the United States 2-1 to reach the semi finals of the Hopman Cup.
The American team of Richey Reneberg and Lindsay Davenport had been
seeded to face the Czech Republic in the last four, but were struggling
from the moment Davenport crashed 6-0, 6-4 to Medvedeva in the opening
singles.
Reneberg and Medvedev produced a high-class men's singles encounter
before the world No. 15 finally ensured Ukraine's moment of glory with a
6-7, 7-6, 6-3 victory.
It was the first time any team from the former Soviet Union had
reached the semi finals of the mixed team tournament, where Medvedev was
keen to do well after defaulting through injury last year.
''I don't know how people will react in Ukraine, but we are both very
proud,'' said Medvedev.
Reneberg could scarcely believe the outcome after producing what he
felt was one of the best performances of his eight-year professional
career. But the American cause had already been badly undermined by
world No. 6 Davenport's startling defeat to Medvedeva, ranked a modest
57th on the computer.
The towering Davenport appeared leaden-footed and out of sorts as
Medvedeva raced into a 6-0, 5-1 lead and a brief second set rally was
never going to save her.
''I didn't expect it to be so easy,'' admitted Medvedeva. ''But I knew
I had a chance to win and I also played one of my best matches.''
Medvedev gave his elder sister a good chance of beating Jana Novotna
in tomorrow's semi final, even though the Czech Republic have a daunting
record in the competition.
The defending champions' 2-1 victory over hosts Australia took them to
the last four for the sixth time in the seven-year history of the event,
yet Petr Korda had to struggle before he completed a 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 win
over Pat Cash.
''The way I served in the first set, I thought I was going to lose
6-1, 6-2,'' said Korda, whose ranking slipped from five to 18 during an
injury-hit 1994.
* BORIS Becker yesterday predicted that Pete Sampras' position as
world No. 1 would come under serious threat in 1995 starting at this
month's Australian Open.
The three-times Wimbledon champion has flown into Australia early to
represent Germany at the Hopman Cup team tournament, clearly still
buoyed by his return to form in the second half of last year.
American Sampras has held the top spot virtually uninterrupted since
April 1993, but Becker believes he and Andre Agassi are well-placed to
challenge for the title if they start the year well.
''The key is to play consistent and good tennis over 12 months. Andre
and myself played good for six to seven months, but in order to
challenge people we have to do what we did in the second half of 1994
for the whole year.''
* SWISS teenage prodigy Martina Hingis says a commonsense approach
will prevent her repeating Jennifer Capriati's experience as a tennis
burn-out.
''It would be silly to play 35 events in 35 weeks,'' said the
14-year-old. ''I'm not going to do that, so there is no danger of
burn-out.''
Speaking on her arrival in Sydney for the qualifying rounds for next
week's New South Wales Open, Hingis said her light schedule to date
marked an early difference to the American's ill-fated career.
Hingis is ranked 87 in the world after playing a handful of adult
events. She turned professional only days after her 14th birthday.
If she qualifies this weekend, she will join Capriati, now on the
comeback trail at the age of 18, in the main draw.

UNLIKE many other sporting bodies whose fixtures are being badly
affected right now by adverse weather, the Scottish Amateur Rowing
Association can plan its next event with confidence.
On the last Sunday of this month, the second Scottish indoor rowing
championships take place within Glasgow Caledonian University, and a
record entry is expected.
This form of the sport -- performed on calibrated rowing machines
called ergometers -- is growing in popularity and there is now a fully
developed European circuit of competitions.
As a result, all performances in the Scottish championships will be
included in the official world ranking tables.
Last year's event also was supported by Glasgow Caledonian University,
who have repeated their sponsorship this year by providing the venue and
other technical back-up.
For this year's event, the FARA are circulating all Scottish leisure
clubs that have a Concept II ergo among their equipment, as well as all
private owners in an attempt to bring more non-rowers into the
competition.
For those experienced oarsmen taking part the format is now familiar.
A bank of eight machines will be in place and competitors will be asked
to cover the computer equivalent of two-and-a-half kilometers on the
instruments of torture.
Altogether, more than 30 separate events will be on offer, for men and
women, ranging from juniors to veterans and from elite performers to
beginners with no rowing experience.
Further details of entries are available from all Scottish rowing
clubs, the Scottish Amateur Rowing Association, and Glasgow Caledonian
University.

SCOTLAND'S residential property market will continue its recovery
during 1995. The market now seems to have settled into a steady, if
patchy, pattern which will continue at roughly the same pace for the
next few years.
If there are no economic earthquakes, the property landscape in the
year 2000 will probably look very much like it does just now. Canny
Scots avoided the worst effects of the property crash, and that same
cautious approach means that we are unlikely to see another property
boom North of the Border before the end of the century.
''I believe we've entered a new era. From now until the year 2000,
prices will go nowhere, although they should stay in line with
inflation,'' says Colvil Johnston, managing director of Slater Hogg &amp;
Howison.
He says that we are moving into the kind of market which has not been
seen in this country since the Seventies, a market where houses change
hands for roughly the same price as they were purchased a few years
earlier.
This used to be the only way in which the market operated. Colvil
Johnston quotes a large country house in Thorntonhall, complete with
staff cottage, which was purchased in the Thirties for #4900 -- then
changed hands five times at prices ranging up, and down, from that
figure.
''Eventually it was sold in 1958 for #5250 and hovered around that
price for 20 years. Now the cottage is worth #250,000 and the main house
is worth about half a million.'' Most of the increase in value happened
during the Eighties.
He believes that a return to stable prices over a long term would
create confidence in the market. ''I'm quite happy for prices to stand
still. So long as people know they are trading in a fair market, then
they will buy and sell houses when they need to, rather than buying and
selling as some sort of investment out of which they hope to make
megabucks.''
Mike Provan, the Halifax Building Society's top man in Scotland,
believes that a full recovery here is still being hindered by the
effects of the property crash in the South.
''The Scottish market will improve when we stop publicising the
English market as if it's the same as Scotland's.
''We were never as badly affected as the South. Repossessions and
negative equity form only a tiny percentage of the Scottish property
scene, whereas they are still having an effect in many parts of
England.''
It's that elusive feel-good factor again: the elements for a good
market are in place but people lack confidence. Prices are stable,
interest rates are low, inflation has been tamed, even if only
temporarily.
Traditional attitudes have firmly reasserted themselves in Scotland.
Houses are for nesting, not investing.
The fear of redundancy will continue to make people think twice about
moving home unless they really have to -- and there is nothing that
estate agents, builders or lenders can do about it.
In fact the big lenders, the banks and building societies, are in the
front line of cutting their staffing levels as new technology,
tele-sales techniques, and mergers between institutions reduce the need
for branches, and people.
If a job in the bank, once thought to be job for life, is no longer
guaranteed then it's not surprising that very few other people feel
secure. The implications of the anxiety factor in the national psyche
have not yet been fully taken on board by the property industry, or by
the politicians.
These new market realities need not be bad news for the property
sector. Booms and busts are no way to run a railroad. People will only
start buying tickets again for the property bandwagon when they are sure
that they are in for a reasonably smooth ride, rather than a trip on the
roller-coaster.
The new homes market rallied last year and house builders were among
the best performers in the construction sector, but the market was again
curiously patchy. It is now clear that buyers have become very
discerning and builders are having to respond with new designs, new
ideas and better developments.
Builders like Beazer have been winning awards for the quality of the
landscaping and environment of their developments, while Barratt came
fighting back from the recession with a set of new house styles which
grabbed the imagination of the market.
''Buying a new house used to be a compromise between what you desired,
and what you could afford -- but not any more,'' says Mike Provan of the
Halifax. ''Builders now have to provide a very high quality of
development. Conventional wisdom says that location is the most
important factor in property, but that has now been superseded by ''kerb
appeal'' -- the impact of the house as soon as you arrive.''
Builders are also bracing themselves to fight the looming threat of
VAT on new housing. Under EC directives, VAT could be extended to
housing in 1997, although the ferocious lobbying power of the industry
is likely to see a delay in imposition.
If the threat becomes reality, there could be a mini-boom in the new
build sector as purchasers try to beat the deadline.
It is now clear that the government's aim of 75% home ownership by the
end of the century has no chance of fulfilment. Among the hardest-hit in
the property crash were low-paid people who should never have purchased
their homes in the first place.
The government was wrong to tell them they would prosper -- and the
banks and building societies should never have tempted them with large
loans on tiny houses at spiralling interest rates.
Only an expansion of the private rented sector and further support for
housing associations can offer real solutions to housing those on low
incomes.
Scotland's home ownership rate stands at just over 50% (and is much
lower in places like Glasgow).
Mike Provan says: ''There's room for growth in the Scottish property
market but it's crazy to talk about 75% home ownership. We'll do well to
reach 60%. We need to create a bigger private rented sector, which would
also help with mobility of labour.''
The government has done nothing to help the industry reach that 75%
target. The Chancellor has just taken careful aim and thrown three more
bricks through the windows of a hard-pressed industry. The withdrawal of
income support for new mortgage holders who become redundant, the
reduction of MIRAS to 15% from April, and the new insurance premium tax
will do nothing to help the long haul to full recovery.
''The government has a completely uncaring attitude to towards the
housing market,'' says Keith Oliver of Edinburgh property solicitors
Olivers WS. ''Their main aim seems to be to stop people borrowing money,
but this has major knock-on effects throughout the economy which are
undermining recovery. Commonsense tells us that people spend most when
they buy or sell, and so if people aren't moving a lot of businesses
suffer.''
However, he is optimistic about the market in Scotland this year, so
long as sellers do not expect high prices. ''They can help themselves by
setting a price that attracts interest, and the property must be
marketed effectively.''
A steady market should steady the nerves of the industry. The one
other looming threat is of increased interest rates. Over the last
couple of years lenders have cut their margins to hold onto market
share, but that won't continue for much longer and further rate rises
are likely to be passed on to their customers.
The canny buyer in 1995 will build in a buffer to allow for further
rises in interest rates.

RAY Illingworth calls him a ''breath of fresh air.'' And now Darren
Gough has blown a hole right through the world's strongest batting
line-up.
Gale-force Gough warned Australia he was in the mood for destruction
24 hours earlier when crashing a half-century off their bowlers.
Yesterday, having swapped bat for ball, he tore into the old enemy
again with a six-wicket performance that gave England a tight hold on
the third Test, and kept the Ashes flame flickering.
Australia have not been forced to follow on since Pakistan embarrassed
them in Karachi six years ago.
But with Gough claiming his best Test figures so far -- and moving to
19 wickets for the series -- they avoided what would have been a severe
shock to their system by just seven runs before being dismissed for 116.
If England's chanting supporters on the Sydney ''hill'' enjoyed
Gough's explosive batting, they simply went wild over his bowling.
Gough deserved all the praise. He has shown England that they can not
only compete with Australia but also make them look second best.
''I think he's absolutely wonderful,'' said Illingworth. ''We could do
with four more just like him.''
Gough, bursting with enthusiasm as usual, set to work after Devon
Malcolm had made the initial breakthrough by bowling Michael Slater via
an inside edge.
He bowled David Boon with an off-cutter -- ''I think that was my best
ball'' -- and then, following further contributions from Malcolm and
Angus Fraser, knocked back Steve Waugh's off stump before persuading Ian
Healy to edge a drive to second slip on the stroke of lunch.
Further glory followed after the interval with Tim May steering
another catch into Graeme Hick's hands.
Gough had taken four wickets for the sixth time in his seven-Test
career -- and Australia were down and almost out at 65 for eight.
But for captain Mark Taylor, contributing 49 to his country's
desperate cause, Craig McDermott, who helped him put on 51, and a couple
of fielding lapses, the follow-on figure would not have been passed.
Gough admitted to thinking ''I'm never going to get a five-for'' when
Malcolm failed to reach what looked an inviting catch hit to mid-on by
McDermott. And his fast bowling partner also missed a difficult return
chance from Taylor before delivering a bouncer that cleared keeper Steve
Rhodes by several inches.
The four byes resulting from one wild Malcolm delivery were sufficient
to take Australia beyond their first objective.
Any ideas they had of making more progress were ended by Gough,
however. His eagerly awaited fifth wicket came with a slower ball,
delivered out of the back of the hand like a leg-break bowler, which
Taylor drove straight back.
The next one was a good deal quicker -- swinging in and shattering
Damien Fleming's stumps -- to leave Australia with their lowest Ashes
total for nearly 14 years.
While England began adding to their first innings lead of 193, Gough
answered the dressing-room phone -- it was Harold Larwood -- and his
unforgettable day was made complete.
If Gough is unable to repeat his first innings heroics later in this
match, it won't be for the want of trying.
He has got a real taste for glory now. And so, perhaps, have England,
who finished the third day 283 runs ahead with nine wickets in hand.
Their only casualty before rain stopped play 40 minutes early was Graham
Gooch, victim of a highly dubious lbw decision.
Meanwhile, Dominic Cork could have been in Australia yesterday
enjoying England's thrilling revival first hand if he, and not
Lancashire batsman Neil Fairbrother, had been called up to replace the
injured Craig White.
Derbyshire's Cork spent up to Christmas on official stand-by for
White, but England's change of priority late on in their Ashes campaign
has not meant automatic promotion.
Yet the 23-year-old shouldered aside any disappointment about that in
Bombay yesterday with a purposeful unbeaten 52 for England A against
India Youth.
Cork's half century, plus a determined 59 from Mark Ramprakash and a
gutsy 33 from Paul Weekes, helped the England to battle their way to 221
for six by the end of the first day in their tour's opening four-day
fixture.
At 125 for five, however, and despite Ramprakash's best efforts, it
did not look as if Alan Wells' second string could answer the uplifting
news of England's Ashes fightback with a stirring performance of their
own.
But all-rounder Cork said: ''I like those sort of situations -- it
tends to bring out the best in me. I like a battle and it was good to
play with a fair amount of pressure on.''

* IT has been a long time since Peter Oosterhuis, the former British
Ryder Cup player, packed his bags and set off for the US Tour.
The big Englishman had his fair share of success in what is believed
to be the tougest tour in the world, and after having returned home, he
now has some words of encouragement for Nick Faldo before the three
times Open winner leaves the European Tour to concentrate his efforts in
the USA.

Oosterhuis, a fairway pioneer
It is a lot different now. Everybody has a coach, they see
psychologists, and would do anything to play better. It is all
so much more businesslike.
IF anyone understands Nick Faldo's move from the European to the US
Tour it is Peter Oosterhuis who, two decades ago, made a similar
decision in the lonely pursuit of excellence.
''I think Nick Faldo is going to have a fantastic year,'' said the 6ft
5in. Londoner with the long surname to match which he inherited from his
Dutch father and which means East House. ''I know there has been a lot
of talk about him deserting the European Tour, but he has totally
different priorities from everybody else.
''He is trying to win majors and is doing whatever he needs to achieve
that. The best way is to play on the toughest tour under the best
conditions.''
Oosterhuis -- talking at the recent Algarve Land of Golf Pro-am at
Quinta Do Lago -- knows what it is like to plough a lone furrow from his
heyday in the seventies, when he was European No.1 four years in a row
from 1971.
''I was very focused on what I was doing,'' he said. ''I was
criticised and called a loner because I wasn't having a couple of beers
with the guys -- I was out practising. I was one of the exceptions back
then, but it is a lot different now. Everybody has a coach, they see
psychologists, and would do anything to play better. It is all so much
more businesslike.''
Faldo, however, still manages to stand out from the crowd even though
the twice European No.1 and winner of five majors has not had a good
year by his standards, slipping to No.8 in Europe. His forthcoming
switch to America has been nothing if not controversial, but Oosterhuis
does not see it that way.
''It is not a slap in the face to the European Tour,'' he said. ''It
is just Nick Faldo aiming at different things from the average player. I
don't see that as a negative. I know sometimes he says the wrong things,
but sometimes the message gets misinterpreted, too.
''It's a little like what I was trying to do 20 years ago, though I
have to stress there was a huge difference in the European Tour at that
time. Those were the pre-Seve days and we were hammered every time in
the Ryder Cup.''
Oosterhuis feels that players like Jose Maria Olazabal, who this year
seriously considered joining Faldo, could benefit also by going to
America, though he is not surprised the Spaniard decided against. He has
seen that before, too.
''I thought that at the time I went, Brian Barnes and Bernard
Gallacher would have gone as well,'' he said. ''They were good enough if
they had wanted to, but Bernie got the great job at Wentworth and Brian
likes his fishing. So for whatever reasons they decided not to. For me,
it was the only way to go. What else could I do? Try to win the European
order of merit 10 years in a row? I thought my game would improve, and
that I would be successful against the best players in the world.''
It didn't work out that way, however. In 13 seasons he was in the top
60 only four times and won just once, the Canadian Open in 1981. ''In
hindsight I have no regrets at going. I was very happy there,''
reflected Oosterhuis, who is still self-critical about his US record,
even though he performed well in six Ryder Cups (14 wins and three
halves in 28 matches) and in several Open Championships.
''It was too easy to say there's another tournament next week instead
of being hard on myself,'' he recalled. ''I think I was just content to
be on the American Tour and slipped into accepting lower standards from
myself.''
He was always said to be a waggler and a shuffler, and being so tall
he rarely looked comfortable over the ball. Latterly, though, he changed
his playing style on the advice of the late Tour player, Bert Yancey.
''He made me understand that a pre-shot routine would help. Right away I
knew I was going to play well. I started finishing in the top 30
regularly, won the Canadian Open, and finished No.28 in the money list,
my best ranking. When you compare it with how the Europeans do in
America nowadays it is not good, but at that time it was.''
The form continued the following year when he finished one behind Tom
Watson in the Open at Troon. That was not his only near miss in a major.
He had been third behind Tommy Aaron in the Masters in 1973, runner-up
to Gary Player in the Open at Lytham in 1974, and in contention at
Carnoustie the following year.
He considers his best Open chance was at St Andrews in 1978, when he
was joint leader going into the last round. ''I shot 38 on the back
nine, hitting every green in regulation. It's almost sacrilegious to say
I should have won it when Nicklaus won his second Open at St Andrews,
but I know that was my best chance.''
After 1982, however, he hit what turned out to be a terminal slump.
''I overdid the routine. Eventually it overrode my natural ability --
the good hand action that had saved me over the years -- and I slipped
into some habits that hurt me. My game deteriorated and it was too late
by the time I realised what I had done.''
He took a club job for four years at Forsgate Country Club in New
Jersey, then moved to the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles for two
years -- where his ex-wife and children have remained -- returning to
Britain on the advice of Dave Thomas, the tour player turned golf course
architect, to be golf director at the Stockley Park development, near
Heathrow Airport, an enterprise run jointly by a business consortium and
European Tour Courses.
There was a brief attempt at a European Tour comeback, but he missed
the cut in all 13 tournaments entered, a performance which has put on
hold any aspirations to play senior golf for which he will be eligible
in three-and-a-half years.
He also has commentated on golf tournaments for Sky Sports, and this
year is back on the European Tour in a non-playing role covering 32
tournaments in partnership with Renton Laidlaw for a new 24-hour golf
channel in America, and accompanied by his new American wife Ruth Ann.
Changed days indeed for the man who won just #32,000 for being No.1 in
1974. Colin Montgomerie, last year's No.1, tallied #762,000. ''It's
unbelievable what they are making now, but I didn't feel I was missing
out on anything at the time. I stayed in the best hotels, had a nice
car, and I don't feel any regrets.''

TRAINER Mark Johnston looks set to land a double on the sand at
Wolverhampton this afternoon with Milngavie and Biya.
The Scot reached 100 winners for the year for the first time last
season and landed his first Classic with Mister Baileys. And he has high
hopes of doing even better this term.
After his success with three of Sheikh Mohammed's horses, the
country's leading owner has sent him nearly four times as many animals
this time around.
And the Sheikh's brother, Maktoum Al-Maktoum, has dispatched a team of
six of his beautifully-bred two-year-olds for the first time.
Neither Milngavie nor Biya are horses of the calibre associated with
the Maktoum family. But they warrant serious consideration in their own
class here.
Milngavie proved a winter warmer for the stable last year when he won
four times on the all-weather, between Janaury and March.
Although he went on to show fair form on the turf later in the season,
the five-year-old is a significantly better performer on an artificial
surface, and is one to be interested in now that the all-weather action
has resumed.
He is far from harshly treated in the Beech Handicap and can make a
winning return to the fray.
Biya is potentially a cut above the modest animals usually seen on the
all-weather.
By Shareef Dancer out of a well-related dam who showed useful form
from limited opportunities for Henry Cecil, he is better bred than any
of his rivals in the Rowan Stakes.
Probable favourite, Contrafire, has had plenty of chances and it would
be no surprise to see him overturned by a newcomer.
Bentico is difficult to oppose in the Ash Handicap.
Trainer Norma Macauley has brought about considerable improvement of
late in the six-year-old who was completing a hat trick when successful
here on Saturday evening.
Today's race looks no more taxing.

A JOCKEY Club investigation into the presence of a banned substance
found in a sample taken from the former Geoff Lewis-trained Bo Knows
Nigel has been dropped.
Tests were carried out on the gelding after he was withdrawn from a
handicap at Folkestone in August, having been the subject of a major
gamble in which his price fell from 16-1 to 2-1 favourite.
Coughing was said to be the reason for the horse's withdrawal -- a
claim supported by a vet's certificate -- but routine tests revealed
traces of the banned substance, hydrocortisone.
On December 6, Lewis asked for a confirmatory analysis of the positive
sample to be carried out by the laborotaries of the Federation Nationale
des Societes de Courses.
This test revealed that the amount of hydrocortisone present in the
sample was beneath the legal threshold of one microgram per millimetre
and, as a consequence, the investigation has been dropped.
David Pipe, the Jockey Club's director of public affairs, said: ''As
was absolutely his right, Geoff Lewis asked for a confirmatory test, and
the level of hydrocortisone was beneath the internationally agreed
threshold.''
However, the matter has not yet been laid to rest.
''Other inquiries will continue into other matters which came to light
during the initial investigation to determine whether any racing rules
have been breached,'' added Pipe.
Bo Knows Nigel, who went on to win two races for Lewis during the
autumn, moved to Ian Campbell's yard in September, but was destroyed
after having broken down over hurdles at Huntingdon on Boxing Day.

ARI Vatanen kicked up his own kind of desert storm in Morocco
yesterday as he took over the lead in the Paris-Dakar Rally with a fine
exhibition of speed and skill on the third leg.
The Finn, driving a Citroen, showed no signs that a two-year absence
from an event he already has won four times, had blunted his artistry on
the tough desert terrain.
Starting the day in fifth place overall, Vatanen put his car through
its paces over 405kms of timed stages on the stony route from El
Rachidia to Ouarzazate, which also included the first sand dunes of the
rally.
Ousting France's Bruno Saby from first place, the Finn took a lead of
more than seven minutes over his Citroen team-mate Pierre Lartigue,
another Frenchman.
''I'm very glad because this was the old Vatanen of the old
Paris-Dakars who was driving here,'' the new leader said after his
efforts of the day.
It was a good day for Citroen with Vatanen's fellow-Finn Timo Salonen
taking over third place as well and pushing Saby's Mitsubishi down to
fourth. Saby lost time when he got lost among the dunes.
In the motorcycles section, Heinz Kinigadner, of Austria, riding a
KTM, extended his lead and now enjoys a 10-minute cushion over Spanish
Cagiva rider Jordi Arcarons. Standings:
Third stage -- 1, A Vatanen (Finland) Citroen, 9hr 05min.22sec; 2, P
Lartigue (France), Citroen, 7min.06sec behind; 3, T Salonen (Finland),
Citroen, 8-03; 4, B Saby (France), Mitsubishi, 12-41; 5, J-P Fontenay

MARK Foster led a successful opening session by Britain's swimmers on
the first day of the World Cup short-course meeting in Hong Kong.
Foster won the 50 metres butterfly and finished third in the 100m
free-style, while Ireland's Michelle Smith was Britain's most successful
women, winning the 100m butterfly and 200m individual medley.
Germany's Sandra Volker set a world record of 27.86sec in the 50m
backstroke, with the UK's Kathy Osher third.
The previous record time for the event was 27.93, set by American
Angel Martino in December, 1993.
Britain's only other major finisher was Joanne Deakins, who came third
in the 200m backstroke.

SABOLCS Majthenyi is the overall leader after the second day of the
World Flying Dutchman class yachting championship at St Vincent's Gulf.
The Hungarian started the day in third place, but after having been
placed first and third in heats, he took the lead.
Eight to 12-knot south westerlies caused a log-jam of yachts at the
leeward mark during the third heat. However, Majthenyi judged the breeze
best, opening an early lead on the fleet, and avoided the congestion.
The congestion resulted in a protest by one of the boats out of the
top 10.
Thirty-six entrants from Australia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan,
New Zealand, and the United States are competing in the championship
which ends next week.

EDINBURGH'S Lisa McKenna, who finished as the runner-up in the
Scottish Junior Open last weekend, has reached the round of the last 16
in the British Junior Open Under-19 squash event at the Lambs Club,
London, yesterday.
The 17-year-old Scot proved too good for Karen Hargreaves, from
Liverpool, winning 9-2, 9-6, 9-6, and she now meets the Egyptian
fifth/eighth seed, Salma Shabana, for a place in the quarter-final
stage.
In the Under-16 championship, the Southport-based Scottish top seed,
Laura Hamilton, and Eden Park's Jane Dickson reached the third round.
Hamilton beat Jenny Slinn (Kent) 9-0, 9-0, 9-1, and the Fifer was an
equally convincing 9-0, 9-0, 9-4 victor over Berkshire's Katharine
Saunders. Results:
Boys. Under-19 (second round) -- L Elriani (France) beat N Dickson
(Eden Park) 9-0, 9-5, 2-9, 2-9, 9-6.
Under-14 (first round) -- A Livingstone (Ipswich) beat A Shelley
(Middlesex) 9-3, 9-0, 9-3. Second round -- K Darwish (Egypt) beat
Livingstone 9-2, 9-2, 9-3.
Girls. Under-19 (second round) -- L McKenna (Edinburgh Sports Club)
beat K Hargreaves (Merseyside) 9-2, 9-6, 9-6.
Under-16 (second round) -- L Hamilton beat J Slinn (Kent) 9-0, 9-0,
9-1; S Francese (Germany) beat G Nimmo (Colinton Castle) 9-2, 2-9, 2-9,
9-2, 9-2; J Dickson (Eden Park) beat K Saunders (Berkshire) 9-0, 9-0,
9-4.
* LISA McKenna, Laura Hamilton, and Jane Dickson all have been
included in Scotland's team for the Under-19 home international
championships which start in Aberdeen on Friday evening.
With the British Open finals due to take place on the same afternoon,
it will be a hectic dash north for several of the players involved.
There is a family flavour to the Scottish teams, with two
brother-and-sister partnerships, Colin and Laura Hamilton, and Neil and
Jane Dickson.
For the girl's team, there is the added incentive of trying to gain
selection for the world junior championships in Australia this summer.
The teams are:
Boys -- N Dickson (Eden Park), G Grant (Skean Dhu), C Gray (Colinton
Castle), C Hamilton (Southport), C Small (Dalgety Bay), A Tasker
(Kirkcaldy).
Girls -- G Davie (Prestbury), J Dickson (Eden Park), K Emerson
(Colinton Castle), L Hamilton (Southport), L McKenna (Edinburgh Sports
Club), P Nimmo (Colinton Castle).

THE youngest members of the Scottish ski team opened their racing
season with promising results in Radstadt, Austria, yesterday, the first
day of the British Alpine Racing Ski Clubs Championships.
After the lack of snow forced the cancellation of most of the British
circuit races over Christmas, the youngsters were desperate for
competition, some having had as much as four weeks training in Austria.
Snow was imported by truck from the surrounding areas to patch up the
race piste, which also was served by four snow-making cannons to produce
an acceptable track for yesterday's childrens age-group giant slalom.
Supplemented by light, overnight snowfalls, the course held together
well for the 101 boys racing.
In dull, overcast, still, conditions, with occasional snow flurries,
Joseph Sharp, from Telford, coached by former British slalom champion
Bill Gaylord and ex-British alpine team colleague Chris Blagden, proved
strongest at this early stage of the season, winning in a time of 37.87
seconds.
The Scottish team's Blair Aitken (Ormiston) finished 21 hundredths
behind in second place, with his Fife based team-mate Gareth Trayner a
further two tenths away in third.
Scots hopes in the girl's race were dented when top-seed Amanda Pirie
(Aberdeen), racing second down the course, fell seven gates from home.
This left Eve Tominey, of the British run French based Ski High
School, more than half a second ahead of second-placed Pamela Robb
(Aberdeen).
The championships are scheduled to include two International Ski
Federation (FIS) races, a slalom and giant slalom later in the week, but
there is doubt whether conditions, which are not scheduled to improve
much, will reach the higher standards required. Results:
Boys. Giant slalom -- 1, J Sharp (Telford) 37.97sec; 2, B Aitken (KPMG
Scottish Team/Ormiston) 38.08; 3, G Trayner (KPMG Scottish
Team/Ladybank) 38.28; 4, R Bagge (Hemel Hempsted) 38.46; 5, D Murray
(Kandahar) 38.48. Other Scots: 8, L Noble (KPMG Scottish Team/Edinburgh)
39.24.
Girls -- 1, E Tominey (SHS France) 40.89; 2, P Robb (KPMG Scottish
Team/Aberdeen) 41.42; 3, C Alcott (DHO) 41.66. Other Scot: 5, L Clark
(Aberdeen) 42.61.

LAST year's Formula One season was unforgettable for Scot David
Coulthard. Test-driving for Williams-Renault, then suddenly pitched into
grand prix battle after the death of Ayrton Senna. It was also a season
of doubt about his future -- and with whom. Now that is all behind him,
as DEREK DOUGLAS reports.
DAVID Coulthard, the 23-year-old Scot from Twynholm, near
Kircudbright, was yesterday confirmed as number two driver to Damon Hill
in the Williams-Renault F1 team and predicted that his first grand prix
win would not be long in coming.
The news that Coulthard has clinched a permanent drive with the
top-flight Williams team -- apparently leaving 1992 world champion Nigel
Mansell in the grand prix wilderness -- means that he will be the first
Scot to figure as a serious grand prix contender since Jackie Stewart
won the last of his three world titles in 1973.
Fellow Scot Johnny Dumfries drove for the Lotus team in 1986 but
Coulthard's emergence last season as a genuine front-runner had many F1
insiders making comparisons between the precociously talented and
self-assured youngster and his illustrious countrymen, Stewart and Jim
Clark.
Yesterday, Coulthard declared himself to be ''well chuffed'' that he
had secured the Williams drive and forecast that he would win his first
full grand prix in the season which gets under way in Argentina in
March.
''I want to take up just where I left off last season and I don't see
any reason why that shouldn't be the case. Last season my performances
relative to Damon were good, and he won five grands prix. With continued
competitiveness from the team and from Renault, I see no reason I can't
improve my performances.
''Hopefully, that first win will come sooner rather than later,'' he
declared.
Coulthard said that his personal relationship with team leader Hill
was now on a first-class footing. That relationship had become strained
at various points last season as the young Scot appeared to be running
faster than the Englishman.
''I have the highest respect for Damon as a driver and as a person.
You have to remember the circumstances which brought us together after
Ayrton Senna's death. Damon became team leader and I was promoted from
being test driver. I ran in front of Damon at the Canadian Grand Prix
and we had a difference of opinion after that race.
''With Ayrton's death, I can't think of any worse circumstances for us
to have begun a partnership, but we have come through that and I now
have the highest regard for him,'' said Coulthard.
Coulthard paid tribute to Jackie Stewart who had acted as a mentor as
he broke through into the often byzantine world of professional motor
racing.
''Jackie was very good for me. He gave me a fantastic amount of help,
not only in terms of driving the car, but also in terms of what to
expect out of it as well. That has stood me in good stead over the past
year.''
The young Scot also thanked his haulage contractor father, Duncan, who
had supported him throughout his motor racing career. ''Obviously, I
told dad what was happening when it became clear that I was signing for
Williams, and he was pleased for me. To break through into grand prix
racing was as much his dream for me as it was mine.''
Team patron Frank Williams announced Coulthard's signing -- it's a
deal reckoned to be worth #500,000 -- by means of a statement from the
Rothman's William Renault headquarters at Didcot. The upshot is that the
young Scot has been preferred to the 41-year-old Mansell, who had been
lured back to the grand prix circuits after a lacklustre season in the
IndyCar series in America.
The team finished the 1994 season as champion constructors for the
seventh time. Hill, Coulthard, and Mansell had all played a part in
amassing the points which meant that Williams was the leading team.
Hill lost the driver's crown in Adelaide in a final race tussle with
the German Michael Schumacher, a race which Mansell went on to win.
Coulthard, who began last season as a Williams test driver got his
chance of a F1 seat after the death of Senna during the San Marino Grand
Prix at Imola. He finished eighth in last season's F1 championship
despite competing in only half of the 16 races.
Coulthard's emergence as a major talent on the Grand Prix scene was
not without controversy. He amassed 14 points throughout an impressive
debut season when his highest placing was second in the Portuguese Grand
Prix.
He had, however, led in Belgium -- the first Scot to head a grand prix
since Jackie Stewart in his pomp -- and he led, too, at Monza where he
finished sixth after waving Hill past to the chequered flag.
His relationship with Hill -- as he conceded yesterday -- was not
always entirely amicable as he chaffed at team orders which,
understandably, sought to promote Hill as the Englishman raced for the
world championship with Schumacher.
The sport was also split by the Williams team decision to sideline
Coulthard in the PR-motivated move to bring Mansell back from America
for four races.
Then, after the season had ended, Coulthard was at the centre of a
contracts row which was resolved only after the sport's Contracts
Recognition Board decreed in Geneva that Williams had first refusal on
Coulthard despite the young Scot having signed a provisional contract
with the rival Mclaren team for 1995.
Yesterday, Coulthard's manager, Tim Wright, said: ''Formula One
negotiations are not for the faint-hearted, but David now has an
excellent contract and a fantastic team, and is in control of his own
career, which totally vindicates everything we have done together over
the last couple of months.
''The 1995 season represents a great opportunity for David to
establish himself after the start he made last season, and this year he
will be on level terms with his team-mate Damon Hill. There will be no
team orders.''
Yesterday, Coulthard's father Duncan, who has played a guiding role in
his son's development from 12-year-old kart racer, said: ''The family is
absolutely delighted for David. This is what he has been aiming for all
these years.
''He is beginning his grand prix career for real with a top team --
Williams really are excellent -- and no young driver could ask for more.
We won't be going to the South American races, but we'll be there to see
him when the European races start. We are really pleased for him and
proud of what he has achieved,'' he said.
After early karting success, Coulthard came to the fore as a Formula
Ford racer, winning British championships in the late eighties. He was
then taken under Jackie Stewart's wing and drove for the ex-world
champion's Vauxhall Lotus team in 1991, coming second in the
championship to current F1 rival Rubens Barrichello.
He continued to drive for the Stewart team in Formula 3000 during 1992
and 1993, and in the latter year clinched the coveted contract to test
drive for the Williams team.
Coulthard was driving in a F3000 race at Silverstone on the day that
Senna died at Imola. Before the race, he had received a handwritten fax
from the Brazilian world champion wishing him the best of fortune in his
race. Coulthard was grief-stricken when news of Senna's death reached
Silverstone, but managed to control his emotions to come a fighting
second.
* Bookmakers Ladbrokes reacted to Coulthard's signing by installing
him as a 10-1 shot to win the 1995 drivers' championship. However, the
Scot doubted whether he would be rushing to his local bookies with a
fistful of dollars. ''I've never bet on anything in my life and I don't
think I'll be starting now,'' he said.

NIGEL Mansell was among the first to congratulate David Coulthard when
motor-racing's worst kept secret became public.
But the news that Renault-Williams have chosen the 23-year-old Scot to
partner Damon Hill in their team next season leaves one question
unanswered. Is Mansell's Formula One career over?
Despite winning the World Drivers' Championship in 1992 and the
IndyCar World Series in the United States the following year, Mansell at
41 is in danger of finding himself left on the shelf.
Unless he can reach an unexpected agreement with McLaren to oust
Martin Brundle as partner to Finland's Mika Hakkinen in their
Mercedes-powered team -- and team boss Ron Dennis has not been his
greatest admirer -- it would appear that early retirement is the only
option.
''With regard to my future, it is too early to comment further at this
time,'' said Mansell, who now has little more than two months to secure
a drive, with the new season's scheduled start in Argentina on March 12.
''I am pleased that the Williams team have made a decision regarding
their driver line-up for 1995 and delighted for David that he has been
given this fantastic opportunity.
''I would like to thank Williams, Renault, and Rothmans for having
given me the opportunity to drive the last three grands prix of 1994 --
and particularly for the victory in Australia.''
Mansell drove for Williams for three spells during his grand prix
career -- 1985-1988, 1991-1992, and those four races last year.
During that time he scored 28 victories -- he has won 31 Formula One
races in all -- 28 pole positions and won the world title.

WHILE the Williams team were happy to settle the question of who will
drive their cars next season, the cash-starved Lotus operation have
announced that it will continue its hand-to-mouth existance in Formula
One this year.
But a statement issued by the team has confirmed that the staff
lay-off, which had originally been until the end of last year, now has
been extended until January 16.
Team-owner David Hunt remains defiant that he can pull the team back
from its current state.
''We have several very positive negotiations underway,'' he said
yesterday, ''a couple of which I hope may bear fruit within the next
fortnight or so.
''I can make no guarantees that we will succeed, but I can assure you
that no stone is being left unturned in our effort to secure the
long-term future of the team.''
Hunt bought the team from administrators prior to November's Japanese
Grand Prix and has since tried to improve the financial situation of the
beleaguered Norfolk-based outfit.
''I am feeling more confident than I was when we last met three weeks
ago,'' concluded Hunt, who must also realise that getting the team back
on the road again is one thing. Gaining the success to keep it there is
quite another.

Ross Finlay test drives the Hyundai Accent
WHEN I read, in a recent Henley Management Centre report, that ''since
the mid- 1980s there has been a singular effort by the XYZ motor
industry, with Government support, to develop export-led business'', it
did not take a profound knowledge of the industry to realise that XYZ
was certainly not the United Kingdom. Here, we have flogged off most of
our indigenous motor manufacturers to foreign interests, and heavily
subsidised new car factories whose ultimate management lies elsewhere.
XYZ is Korea, where such courses of action would be considered
positively insane.
There is a relentless ambition in the Korean vehicle industry.
Sometimes things do not go too well, for instance when sales in North
America all but evaporated as currency movements and wage increases made
Korean cars no longer the bargains they had been in the beginning. But,
taking Hyundai as an example, there is a specifically Korean way of
doing things.
Hyundai Motor started as a simple assembly operation building up kits
bought in from abroad. Then it introduced the first Korean-inspired car,
importing Mitsubishi engines, transmissions and floor pans from Japan.
Now, with the Accent, it has a complete Korean product using its own
12-valve engine range. All the while, the car company has been just a
single component of one of the biggest industrial conglomerates in the
world.
Given their massive resources, it is a puzzle why Korean manufacturers
devote so much effort to other people's cast-offs. However, here now is
the first-ever all-Korean design, and Hyundai must be hoping that,
having got in first, it will not be affected by the potential
over-supply problem which some observers suggest will catch up with the
Korean industry sooner or later.
The Accent is a neatly proportioned, perhaps rather anonymous looking
car in its various body styles, although the 1.3 Coupe has a grotesque
front end. The design offers unexpectedly good rear legroom, generous
headroom all round, but restricted width in front. At least, two of us,
six-footers sharing the driving of both a 1.3 Coupe and a five-door
GLSi, found that we crunched elbows when there was any kind of brisk
wheel-twirling going on.
Prices are highly competitive. The entry level 1.3 Coupe costs #6599
and the 1.5-litre GLSi is the range-topper at #9599. It is curious that
Hyundai's two Alpha engine capacities are so close together. The 1.3 is
actually 1341cc and the 1.5 is 1495cc.
Performance figures are naturally very similar. The 1.3 peaks at 83bhp
and matches a 0-60mph time of about 12.5 seconds with a test track
maximum around 108mph. Top speed of the 1.5 is almost exactly the same,
it trims more than a second off the 0-60mph sprint, and the real benefit
of its 87bhp and meatier torque is stronger mid-range pull.
Fuel economy is top class. Both sizes of Accent, with manual
transmission, manage about 62mpg at 56mph and 45 at 75, while the 1.3's
39mpg on the urban cycle is appreciably better.
Panel fit and body finish are on a par with Hyundai's direct Japanese
rivals. Handling is safe with a strong bias towards understeer. Dry-road
grip is fine, and there was a secure feel on the slippery stretches of
the short but wintry test route.
This is not, however, any kind of sports saloon. Ride quality is
generally good, but it does deteriorate on the bumpier surfaces to be
found on many Scottish minor roads.
Pleasant fascia layout, a light gear change and attractive fabrics are
other features which show that Hyundai is taking European tastes
seriously. As the biggest and oldest established of the Korean
manufacturers, it has a declared ambition to build up to an annual
production capacity of two million units by the start of the next
century. Modified versions of other people's designs will certainly not
let it progress to that extent, and the Accent must be the start of its
major expansion.

<HEADLINE>College project yields new insights into the production of food crops</HEADLINE>

WITH increased concern about food and environmental quality, and the
rising cost of production, agricultural systems that are efficient and
sustainable may provide farmers with new management strategies for the
21st century.
Identifying those strategies, however, will require research -- and an
open dialogue between farmers and agricultural specialists.
For the past five years, researchers with the Scottish Agricultural
College, under the EU pilot project Sustainable Farming Systems, have
conducted research and training programmes focusing on various
sustainable agricultural practices. The project has yielded new insights
into producing food crops based on combinations of organic, non-organic,
and sustainable practices.
Professor Barry Dent, of the University of Edinburgh Institute of
Resource Management, was the key person who helped to establish the
Organic Farming Centre with researchers at Jamesfield, near Perth, by
securing financial support from the European Commission in 1989.
Three years later, research activities for arable and vegetable
enterprises were moved to SAC's Woodside research farm at Elgin,
Morayshire, and other research on rotation and animal production and
welfare was expanded at the grassland and cereal farm on the Craibstone
Estate near Aberdeen.
Now, almost 18 months after the Prince of Wales formally launched the
Sustainable Farming Systems Initiative between the University of
Edinburgh and SAC, research, education and training programmes have been
conducted for farmers in the UK, Portugal and Holland. Earlier this
year, another contract was obtained from Brussels to provide additional
training and support for small to medium agricultural enterprises.
''The public is concerned about food quality and environmental
safety,'' according to Professor Dent. ''Agricultural systems based on
lower inputs of chemicals and more on organic management practices will
be needed. We believe that there are many sustainable agricultural
practices that can be implemented in certain types of farming. Our job
is to fund that technology, modify it according to our research findings
and local conditions, and make it available.''
The Sustainable Farming Systems Initiative has four major components.
It is designed to carry out research on food production systems with
reduced inputs of non-renewable resources, including non-organic and
organic farming systems; to operate organically-based farms for both
research and demonstration; to examine marketing opportunities; and to
develop training manuals to disseminate the technology.
Developing economic systems of food production based on the use of
biological production and management practices with minimum inputs is
critical, but the measure of its success is the implementation of the
technology on local farms. Additional financial support obtained from
the EU under a programme for small to medium sized businesses and farms,
has helped to transfer this technology to farmers, and to train people
as facilitators of that information.
According to Charlie Wannop, the chief extension officer of the
Sustainable Farming Systems Initiative, training material has to be
adapted to meet local conditions. ''That's why we sponsored farmer to
farmer visits before we conducted our training programmes.''
A primary component included inter-country visits for a limited number
of farmers from Portugal, Holland, and the UK. During these visits
farmers would discuss the different types of farming practices unique to
their own countries, and see first-hand the types of sustainable
practices that are used in other countries.
Dairying in Portugal, for example, is very different from dairying in
Scotland. Farmers live in the village, and not on the farm -- and shared
milking parlours are quite common in many communities.
A hill farmer from Broughton, Sandy Welsh, was a member of an advisory
team that went to Portugal to help Sustainable Farming Systems develop
training programmes. The five-day visit was designed to meet with
farmers, collect information on local production practices, management
techniques, and other farming characteristics in Portugal. Other members
of the team included farmers and specialists from the UK, Holland, and
Portugal.
Mr Welsh, who manages a 2000-acre sheep and beef farm, said that he
was interested in the production and marketing aspects of his visit.
Future training programmes should include more visits to successful
farms, rather than just lectures and written reports.
''Progressive farmers will seek out new information and farming
techniques, but the great majority will sit back and wait for it to come
to them,'' he said. ''Teaching farmers how to find out more information,
and stimulating healthy debate among local groups, should be
encouraged.''
Aidan Harrison, a sheep and beef tenant farmer in England, said the
emphasis on producing quality was the single most striking aspect of his
visit to Portugal. The main reason for the economic viability of the
Portuguese farms he saw, was that a high proportion of the retail price
came back to the farmers, rather than being taken by the wholesaler and
the supermarket.
''Portuguese farmers are still high-quality, low-volume food
producers, earning high prices -- while their UK counterparts have
become high-volume, low-price, raw material producers,'' he said. ''From
the sustainability point of view, I think the Portuguese system is
crucial.''
Dutch farmers Jo Schuylanburg and Ron Kemink also agreed that the
Portuguese farmers were quality oriented. Mr Schuylanburg said they were
only interested in using low inputs -- but were high output thinkers. Mr
Kemink said most vegetables were grown without using any chemicals, and
most were of superior quality.
''At the end of the week, it was clear to me that we can learn a lot
from each other, as long as we don't think that our own knowledge is
superior,'' said Mr Kemink.
''If this project is going to be successful, it must start at the
grassroots,'' said Mr Wannop. ''We wanted farmers from the three
countries to meet and exchange ideas about their own specific farming
practices. Before we can deliver any training programmes on sustainable
farming practices, we need to ask farmers what they need, and want. They
can help us decide on the type of training material and delivery
techniques to use.''
Training material focusing on sustainable techniques on soil
fertility, finance, animal health, and other topics, have been
developed. The next step was to conduct training courses for people to
deliver this information to others.
The first trainer of trainers course was conducted by Mr Wannop and Dr
David Wyllie from the SAC's Department of Genetics and Behavioural
Science in Edinburgh. Held in Trancoso, Portugal, the course included
information on group dynamics, learning characteristics, facilitating
skills, and various delivery techniques. Participants included farmers
from Portugal, Holland, and the UK, including Mr Nick Brett, who helps
manage a 120-acre farm near Dolphinton for for the Garvald Trust.
That farm is a caring farm which provides living accommodation and a
school for about 35 residents who are mentally or physically
handicapped. The home was established in 1945, and the farm was added in
1987. About 10 trainees are carefully supervised at work on the farm.
''I would like to see more people trained in sustainable management
skills in rural areas,'' said Mr Wannop. ''We have developed information
manuals, but we need to provide more training programmes for trainers.
With continued support from the EU and other agencies, I think we can
make a difference in the implementation of sustainable farming systems
that are economical and productive.''
Using today's knowledge to modify selective agricultural practices of
past years, may help to reduce production costs and improve crop yield
and quality. The judicious use of chemicals to protect crops will still
play a major role in agricultural production in the years ahead, but
systems that rely less on non-organic inputs, and more on biologically
based methods of plant and animal production, could be the blueprint for
tomorrow's farms.

THE vital role of meat in a balanced diet will continue to come under
the spotlight in the coming year, according to John Scott, president of
the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers. However, he sees 1995 as a
year of opportunity for the meat trade in Scotland.
With the setting up of a Scottish Diet Action Group, reporting to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, the role of meat as part of a healthy,
balanced diet, would come under close scrutiny.
''We must ensure that our voice is heard in this ongoing debate, and
that the debate is not unduly influenced by quasi-scientific arguments
which are based on emotion rather than scientific fact,'' he said.
''Meat, in its infinite forms, is not only an essential part of a
balanced, healthy diet, but an experience which gives consumers pleasure
and enjoyment.''
The meat industry as a whole will be seeking to make 1995 the year in
which they get over the message that they have, in fact, responded to
calls from the health lobby for a reduction in fat levels.
Over the past 20 years, they argue, there has been a 25% fall in the
fat level in pigs. Now, in their view, it is time for the medical
profession to respond by giving out more constructive advice on diet.
Colin MacLean, the Meat and Livestock Commission's director-general,
has been touring the UK hammering home that message. His line is that
the farming and meat industries have done a tremendous job in getting
fat levels down. If the medical profession had done half as well, then
the current diet and health concerns would not be such a problem, he
says. ''Lean meat is packed with nutrients, but the medical profession
is less interested in nutrition than it should be, and it gives
conflicting and confusing advice to the consumer.''
The Commission have begun putting their case to the Ministry of
Agriculture and to the Department of Health, and they have already
indicated that increased contribution levies will be required from the
industry if they are to undertake a high profile PR battle on behalf of
meat and meat products.
Producers have been encouraged to adapt feeding regimes so that they
can produce animals with less fat. Lamb producers, in particular, have
been singled out for a warning that they must look to reduce fat levels
wherever possible.
Looking back on 1994, Mr John Scott saw the year as a traumatic one
for the meat industry, with the pressures of over-capacity, high cattle
and sheep prices, BSE, and associated health and diet issues continuing
to weigh heavily.
He looked forward in the new year to the UK coming finally out of
recession, and consumers being prepared to spend more on meat and meat
products.
''We can take comfort in Scotland that we produce quality beef, lamb,
and pork, which is unsurpassed in the market place, and we have the
opportunity for further development of our export market, which has been
one of the real success stories of the meat industry in Scotland in
recent years,'' he said.

ABERDEEN Trust has added a further 10% or so to its funds under
management with the cash purchase of the unit trust side of Prosperity
Life for #4.1m.
The acquisition from Century Life, which recently took over most of
Prosperity, adds around #240m in new funds and raises Aberdeen's total
funds under management to about #2650m.
Prosperity currently runs 10 small unit trusts and these will be
merged into one -- a global emerging markets fund -- by Aberdeen which
already handles around 20 unit trusts and several investment trusts.
''This particular fund will fit well into our portfolio as we already
manage an investment trust in the same emerging markets sector,''
Aberdeen's Martin Gilbert explained yesterday.
The latest accounts of Prosperity's two unit trust-related
subsidiaries -- PUTM and PIM -- show annual aggregate pre-tax profits of
#550,000 for 1993. However, last year is sure to be less successful
because of the contraction of world stock markets.
As part of the acquisition agreement, Aberdeen not only takes over the
#160m of funds controlled by Prosperity but also a further #80m recently
acquired by Century. Management is confident that, even after related
rationalisation costs, the new funds will immediately enhance earnings.
Last month, Aberdeen Trust notched up another fine performance for the
year to end-September, reporting a 60% rise in pre-tax profits to #5m.
It announced then that its expansionist plans were still in place and
predicted the purchase of fresh unit trust funds which, with no addition
to overheads, should go straight to the bottom line. So yesterday's
announcement is unlikely to be the last of its kind this year.
Six of the Aberdeen-based fund managers' investments trust expanded
through issues during the year, and a brand new trust, the #20m Latin
American fund, was launched just after the September year-end.

<HEADLINE>Pentex Oil is being introduced to the Stock Exchange</HEADLINE>

FORMED in 1981 by a small group of Scottish businessmen wishing to
participate in the expanding oil and gas industry, Aberdeen-based
independent oil and gas production and exploration group Pentex Oil is
coming to the market through an introduction sponsored by Henderson
Crosthwaite Corporate Finance.
Dealings in the shares are expected to start tommorrow.
Pentex's early activities were, of necessity, limited to the
acquisition of a number of UK, predominantly Scottish, exploration
licences. By 1986, though, it needed a fresh injection of capital and in
1987 the present management team, led by executive chairman Henry O.
Cameron, founder and senior partner of Peterkins, Solicitors, one of the
largest Scottish legal practices, bought into the company and took over
its running.
The negotiation of an initial revolving credit facility for US$25m
with a consortium of banks led by Bank of Scotland enabled the company
to make its first significant acquisition in 1989, with the purchase
from BP of a number of licences relating to a group of producing oil and
gas fields in the East Midlands.
This was followed by various other acquisitions, including offshore
interests in the Balmoral and Maureen Fields from Lasmo.
The business has grown to such an extent that it was felt the shares
should now be quoted, the benefits of which will create a market in the
shares, easier access to equity capital for future expansion and a
heightened profile with present and prospective customers and in the oil
industry generally.
It will also enable Pentex to take advantage of acquisition
opportunities in the oil and gas industries, believed to be funamental
to the group's prospects.
Group profits before tax have grown from #780,000 in 1991 to #4.1m in
1993. In the six months June 30, 1994, they amounted to #1.29m.
Pentex expects to drill eight wells in the course of the next two
years. It says that each well will be drilled into proven reserves and
resultant expected increases in production will be handled by existing
facilities so that no material capital costs will be required to
supplement the existing infrastructure.
Output from existing producing assets, including the effects of
depletion, is expected to increase until the second half of 1996, after
which it will decline at a steady rate of depletion until the second
half of 2013.
The sale of natural gas is expected to be at a steady rate from the
second half of 1994 until 2013. Electricity generated from gas (not
otherwise sold as natural gas) is forecast to rise in a phased manner to
9mw in 1996 and remain at that level for approximately seven years.
Pentex's intention is to increase these production levels by
decelerating the rate of decline and by increasing the ultimate amount
of oil recovered from existing assets by developing drilling,
recompletions and stimulations. Further producing assets with ''upside
potential'' will also be required.
And the company says that expansion and acceleration of the
exploration programme in the short term will also mean that any
resultant discoveries can be brought on stream quickly.
There are the usual health warnings. Oil and gas exploration,
development and production involve a high degree of risk. Levels of
production actually achieved may vary significantly from projections.
And the current valuation of such future production is based on
projections of future oil and gas prices, exchange rates and costs,
which may fluctuate over time.
Among other caveats, no guarantees can be given as to the success of
the exploration drilling programme, which could be interrupted by
factors outside the company's control.
Divided payments will start when the terms and conditions of the
group's bank facilities permit, which is expected to be for the year
1996.
Meanwhile, the directors -- who with their families collectively own
24.54% of the issued share capital -- their associates and senior
employees have agreed, as required by the Stock Exchange, not to dispose
of any of their shares (other than between themselves) for a period of
two years from the commencement of dealings following the introduction.

HOUSE prices rose sharply in December compared with November but were
virtually unchanged during the course of last year, the Nationwide
Building Society said yesterday.
Its monthly house price index recorded a rise of 1.8% last month,
taking the national average value to #53,745 -- #931 higher than in
November. But compared with the start of the year average prices
increased by just 0.3%.
Brian Davies, Nationwide's chief executive, said: ''December's
recorded rise in prices is largely a correction of a similar fall in
November. The overall market remains flat.''

THE growth of narrow money, M0, which covers notes and coins in
circulation, slowed last month, but City economists were still left
contemplating another rise in interest rates in the next two months.
The latest purchasing managers' survey showed that activity is
continuing at a robust pace despite some signs of a let-up. The prices
index was the second highest on record.
M0 grew at a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in December to give an annual
rate of increase of 6.6%, down from 7% in December. The strongest growth
was in bankers' balances.
On their own, notes and coins grew by 0.2%, and the annual rate
declined from 6.8% to 6.3%. The three-month annualised rate dropped from
5.9% to 3.9%.
December figures for the likes of money supply and retail sales are
notoriously difficult to interpret. The seasonal adjustment element is
exceptionally large, and the timing of Christmas Day can have a crucial
effect.
For the better part of two years, M0 has been above the upper limit of
its 0% to 4% monitoring range. This has been a reflection of the
relatively low level of interest rates and of the strength of retail
sales.
James Capel's Adam Cole welcomed the slowdown in narrow money, but
said that the growth rate was still a cause of concern for a cautious
central bank.
The next meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the
Governor of the Bank of England is scheduled for February 2, just after
the Bank's quarterly report on inflation.
The Bank monitors a wide range of inflation indicators, including M0.
The Purchasing Managers' Index has too short a track record to merit
much attention. Much more significant is CBI survey evidence on
manufacturers' price intentions and capacity constraints.
City economists are forecasting that base rates will rise from 6.25%
to 7.5%-8% by the end of the year, with the bulk of the increases
concentrated in the first half of the year.
Manufacturing growth slowed in December for the fifth month in a row
and the pace of price increases eased slightly, the Purchasing Managers'
Index showed.
The monthly index, published by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply, fell to 56.7% last month from 57.6% in November. It was the
25th month in a row that the index was above 50%, indicating that the
manufacturing sector expanded from the previous month.
The prices index fell from a peak 72.6% in November to 70.7% and has
now been above 70% for six months. The main items which rose in price
were paper, plastics, steel, aluminium, and chemicals. The biggest
increases were in chemicals, rubber, and plastics.
''Despite the overall buoyancy, suppliers are facing real difficulty
in meeting the continued growth in demand from the industrial sector,''
the institute's director general, Mr Peter Thomson, said.
''Purchasing managers are not only buying more to sustain increases in
production, they are also stocking up in anticipation of further price
increases.''
Larger stocks of finished goods in the consumer sector reflected
slower than expected sales before Christmas, he added.

MOBILE telephone market leaders Vodafone Group and Cellnet both set
new monthly subscriber records in December on a surge of Christmas
buying, the two companies said yesterday.
Vodafone added 125,000 net new connections to its network in December,
bringing its subscriber total to 1.64 million.
Cellnet, 60%-owned by British Telecommunications, said separately it
had added 139,000 during the month, putting it fractionally behind
Vodafone with 1.56 million.
Although keen to see signs in the figures of a longer lasting boom in
the market, both firms admitted that such growth had strong seasonal
elements.
''December is a one-off. There had been an enormous amount of
advertising over the period,'' a Vodafone spokesman said. ''But what is
different this time is the amount of consumer users we are getting,'' he
added.
Cellnet managing director Howard Ford said the figures proved the
market itself was changing. ''There was a Christmas surge, but there has
been a fundamental change in the dynamics of the market. The yuppie
image is dead and gone,'' he said.
Mr Ford said people were now buying mobile phones like any other
electronic consumer product.
The Christmas boom was also helped by sharp promotional price-cutting
that has seen the price of some handsets fall way below cost to as
little as #50.
Vodafone chief executive Sir Gerald Whent said that, as a result, the
cost to the industry as a whole of such growth would be high in the
current year. ''However, the rewards will be seen in the coming years,''
he added.
Peter Roe, an analyst with brokers Paribas in London, said the subsidy
on handset prices meant Vodafone and Cellnet typically started making
money out of a new connection only after about eight to 12 months.
''But once you've got someone on the network it is extremely
profitable,'' he added.
Other analysts also applauded the figures, but some warned that the
number of people cancelling subscriptions, the so-called ''churn rate'',
was still high. ''A lot of people are still leaving the network soon
after joining it,'' Credit Lyonnais Laing's Mike Stiles said.
Apart from Vodafone and Cellnet, other market players are the
Hutchison Whampoa-owned Orange and the One2One service operated by Cable
&amp; Wireless' Mercury.

MORNING Noon &amp; Night, the independent chain of convenience stores, has
celebrated the New Year with the purchase of its 21st outlet.
The acquisition of the combined licensed grocer and newsagent in
Bucksburn, Aberdeen, keeps the Dundee-based company well on course
towards its target of 24 stores throughout Scotland by the end of the
current financial year in March.
Despite the price-cutting among the big operators, MN&amp;N has shown
there is still scope for growth under the guidance of founder Eddie
Thompson, a former joint managing director of Watson &amp; Philip.
In fact, Mr Thompson has made it clear that he would like to speed up
the expansion by buying a clutch of stores from one of the bigger
chains.
''We have looked at a number of options, but the terms or individual
shops on offer were not quite right,'' he said. ''But I must admit that
this business of opening one store at a time is simply not enough for us
and we are still hopeful of a bigger purchase.''
The addition of stores last year has pushed up turnover by some 24%,
though like-for-like growth is closer to 2.5% in the month or so before
Christmas.

MAURICE Saatchi's angry valedictory message cut little ice in the
City, where, although the shares of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi dipped 3p to 146p,
analysts put an optimistic gloss on the news.
The final departure of Mr Saatchi from the company he founded marks
the end of the boardroom struggle which has been going on for months.
The group now can concentrate on building on the recovery it has so far
achieved -- that and deciding on a new name.
Mr Saatchi was ousted from his position as chairman in mid-December
and was offered the largely honorary post of president plus the
chairmanship of a subsidiary, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Worldwide. He had to
make his mind up by yesterday and it came as little surprise that he
decided to walk away from the company.
The principal complaint he makes in his open letter is that Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi has been effectively taken over through the back door by a group
of American investors led by David Herro of fund manager Harris
Associates. This is an exaggeration because they could only have
succeeded with the help of other large institutional holders, including
M&amp;G, the unit trust group, which would probably have raised the
dissident vote to over 50% if it had ever actually come to a poll.
Mr Herro is hardly likely now to start telling Saatchi &amp; Saatchi how
to run its business. He would not have the expertise and, moreover, the
group has competent senior managers who have been running the business
and achieving a recovery. They will be relieved that the long-running
battle with the founder is over.
The management is accused of jeopardising relationships with key
clients. There is undoubtedly some disaffection, with Mars and British
Airways (BA) having actively campaigned on Mr Saatchi's behalf and
Mirror Group Newspapers also reported to be concerned. Mars and BA have
threatened to review their business with the group.
As a people business, advertising agencies are always under threat of
customers defecting or employees walking out and taking customers with
them, so clients have to be kept sweet. But the great majority have
regular contact with ordinary staff members and have no reason to desert
just because of a change at the top.
The three clients which have openly expressed concern are closely
associated with Mr Saatchi himself but the loss of their business would
not be catastrophic as they account for about 8% of total revenue. It is
unlikely that all three will look elsewhere.
Indeed, industry observers point out that it would be difficult and
costly for them to withdraw at short notice and find another agency to
take over. More likely current campaigns will be allowed to continue at
least until they are concluded and by that time the whole affair will
have receded into the distance.
The argument that advertising agencies of all businesses need a figure
of flamboyance or at least cachet at the top is past its sell-by date
given the ethos of the sober 1990s and the emphasis on lean and mean
management. The men in grey suits now very definitely rule.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's chief executive since April last year, Charles
Scott, is not really an ad man at all but an accountant. This has not
stopped the group winning important new accounts such as the National
Lottery and Qantas. These accounts have helped the company to financial
recovery. Interim figures in August showed a 65% leap in profits to a
higher than expected #15.3m.
Analysts see profits continuing to rise strongly into 1996 and Saatchi
shares, down from a high of 178p, look an interesting buy regardless of
the vitriolic remarks of its former chairman.
His final departure marks the end of a career of an ikon of the 1980s
who rode the Thatcher dream but came down to earth with a thud in the
harsh atmosphere of the 1990s. Even critics have to admit that he put
the advertising industry on the map in terms of public awareness, making
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi one of the best known brand names. He brought British
dominance to an industry considered quintessentially American, as the
Beatles had done in pop music 20 years before.
That was the time when the two Saatchi brothers, Maurice and Charles,
sons of a wealthy textile merchant who came to Britain from Iraq in
1947, set up on their own, forming a company in 1967 with the financial
help of Mary Quant, another name to conjure with. Maurice had already
drifted into the media world after sailing through university where he
picked up a First Class Honours degree in sociology, while Charles at 27
was recognised as a copywriter of genius.
The duo really took off with the picture of a pregnant man with the
slogan, ''Would you be more careful if it was you that got pregnant?''
for a campaign for the Health Education Council.
Creative ideas tumbled from the company and it was not long before
ambition to become bigger quickly resulted in the first of what would be
many takeovers, of Compton UK Partners Group. This was skilfully
absorbed and whetted the appetite for more.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi only reached household name status with its slick
campaign for the Tory party which began in 1978. The ''Labour isn't
working'' poster is one of the classics of advertising. The heady spirit
of the 1980s encouraged many entrepreneurs into empire building and none
more so than the Saatchi brothers.
Deals followed one another until by 1986 they could boost the world's
largest advertising company giving the global reach that the
multinationals wanted. At one point they apparently thought of
diversifying -- through buying Midland Bank no less.
The crunch came when interest rates started being ratcheted up at the
end of the decade. Profits were soon replaced by spiralling losses and
with frightening speed the strategy became not empire building but mere
survival. Not surprisingly the Saatchis couldn't handle cost-cutting and
shrinkage.
By 1991 Maurice was no longer chief executive, though as chairman he
remained determined to continue to have a say in how the group was run.
Clashes were inevitable, though Maurice did agree with the move to
performance-related pay, replacing his own five-year contract worth
#625,000 annually with a three-year contract at a fixed #200,000 plus
bonuses.
This happened last June when there appeared to be more harmony at the
top levels of the company. But this did not last and a simmering row
with Charles Scott came to a head last month, when he was presented with
a fait accompli.
It is hard to believe that the advertising world has heard the last of
the Saatchis and they are reportedly talking of setting up in business
again. But there must be doubt over whether in middle age they can
generate the enthusiasm to begin again. They certainly don't need the
money even if their fortune is not on the scale it was in their heyday.
The Saatchi letter in full
For 25 years I have had the privilege of working with you to create
and build Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
Throughout those years your loyalty to the company in both good and
hard times made me feel uniquely blessed.
The letters so many of you have sent me during the past week urging me
to stay as chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising has been inspiring.
I will always treasure them.
So it is with sadness that I must tell you I cannot accept the offer
of that position and instead must sever my connections with the company
we have built together. You deserve to know the reasons.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has been taken over. No bid for the company has been
announced. No offer has been made. No premium has been made. No
shareholder vote has been taken. But make no mistake, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
is under new control.
The new 'owners' -- a group of shareholders owning around 30% of the
shares -- have found a simple, if crude, method of controlling the
company.
By threatening the directors with an extraordinary general meeting --
at which they could outvote others -- they have given the directors
their orders: 'Take your chairman into a corner and shoot him quickly --
we don't want the fuss of a public trial'.
I have watched in dismay as some of our longest client relationships
have been jeopardised, the wishes of key clients ignored and the loss of
their business assessed as ''a price worth paying''.
I have listened in despair as the views of leading executives of this
company were dismissed as ''irritating'' and ''irrelevant''.
And for the first time in 25 years found myself in an advertising
company where the term 'advertising man' was being used as an insult.
I have observed how after seeing the value of their shares rise by 17%
since the spring against the 2% fall for the FTSE-100 Index, this
shareholder group nevertheless went ahead and plunged the company into a
period of uncertainty and instability.
A period in which the directors now face a law suit from other
shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty, and in which all shareholders
lost in just five days half the share price gain we have painstakingly
won since the spring.
How could I help to strengthen our relationships with our clients
when, in the perverse logic of our new 'owners', loyal client
relationships are not understood to be the company's great asset?
How could I reassure you of our critical importance to the company
when the views of so many of the most respected among you have been
ruthlessly brushed aside?
This enforced parting grieves me deeply.
Yes I look forward to 1995 with great anticipation. Because, as we
have always believed at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi......Nothing is Impossible.
With every good wish.
Maurice Saatchi.
3rd January 1995.

New York, Tuesday -- Virgin Atlantic Airways said it plans to pursue
its anti-trust claim against British Airways in US courts and will ask
for maximum damages.
Earlier, a US District Court in New York rejected British Airway's
motion to dismiss Virgin Atlantic's claim for American anti-trust relief
related to British Air's plans for expanding its US operations.
Virgin chairman Richard Branson said: ''Since BA has chosen to take
this course of action Virgin Atlantic will now recommence prosecuting
the case in the US immediately and pursue maximum damages.''
The District Court will consider whether BA monopolised air travel
between the United States and Britain as Virgin Atlantic Airways has
alleged.
Virgin filed the suit against British Airways more than a year ago and
is claiming $325m in damages. Its allegations, part of a long-running
''dirty tricks'' saga, centre on claims that BA used unfair and illegal
tactics to poach customers.
A British Airways spokesman said the company had no immediate comment
but planned to issue a statement.
District Court Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, in a ruling released
today, said the court will consider whether British Airways had a
monopoly on air travel between the United States and Britain.

Composer Nigel Osborne cares more for the fate of Bosnia than for
concerts or critics. With his cello concerto about to enjoy its British
premiere, Conrad Wilson finds him hard at work bringing music to
children in the war zone
WHEN Nigel Osborne set off for Sarajevo shortly before Christmas, he
left the Scottish Chamber Orchestra without a programme note for its
performances of his cello concerto next week and the writer of this
article without his interview. But then, the fate of Bosnia means more
to him than mere concerts or critics, and taking music to Bosnian
children is more urgent than events here in Britain.
Osborne, now 46, has known Bosnia since his student days and does all
he can to be useful, spread hope and keep music flowing. Aware -- as one
friend has put it -- that a whole side of Bosnian culture has been
systematically wiped out, he has been quietly replenishing it by taking
small musical instruments, such as castanets and maracas, round schools
and showing what can be done with them.
But, in the words of another friend, he ''concentrates equal intensity
here at home on special-needs projects, visiting prisoners, people with
dementia, extremely handicapped people, people who have gone through
crises, getting them all to make music as best they can''.
For a composer, his range of interests is indeed conspicuously wide.
His music, says one encyclopedia is ''that of an acute, penetrating mind
stimulated as much by social concerns as by a fascination with
20th-century Russian literature''.
He is a friend of the poet Craig Raine. He admired the film director
Andrei Tarkovsky enough to mourn him in an elegy recently performed by
the SCO. In Tempo magazine, he praised the work of Andre Panufnik, a
Polish composer he considered seriously underrated.
His own output includes an opera entitled The Electrification of the
Soviet Union (to words by Raine) and another entitled Terrible Mouth on
the subject of Goya's war experiences. He has a natural grasp of
languages and, as Edinburgh University's Reid professor of music, he has
revolutionised his department's curriculum, placing great emphasis on
group composition. More and more post-graduate students are being drawn
to Edinburgh simply because of his presence.
''Nigel is really too intelligent to be a composer,'' a
fellow-composer said to me recently, perhaps not wholly in jest. If your
idea of a composer is someone who sits at a desk or at a piano,
inexorably hammering out the notes or wrestling with tone rows, Osborne
would seem decidedly different.
For a start, his instrument is the violin. But apart from that his
mind is a firecracker jumping in all directions. Everyone speaks of his
''humanity'', his ''political awareness'', his desire to communicate
without ever talking down.
Born, like Peter Maxwell Davies, in Manchester, he studied at Oxford
(where he was a pupil of his Edinburgh University forerunner, Kenneth
Leighton) and later at the Warsaw Academy, which gave him an insatiable
taste for Eastern European culture. As a composer, he gained notoriety
in 1986 via his sensational opera, Hell's Angels, written for David
Freeman's Opera Factory, in which Aids was represented as an act of
divine judgment upon Vatican corruption.
Next came The Electrification of the Soviet Union, inspired by the
autiobiographical writings of Boris Pasternak and dealing with the
Russian Revolution as seen through the eyes of a young poet, a governess
and a prostitute. Brilliantly characterised and strikingly structured,
it was direct enough in its impact to win a series of performances at
Glyndebourne and a complete TV relay.
Whether or not Osborne is ''too intelligent'' to be a composer, his
vast range of enthusiasms has not prevented him from producing an
impressive body of compositions, orchestral and instrumental as well as
operatic. Some of them, admittedly, have seemed disappointingly slight
in content, but in others -- such as the cello concerto he has written
for the SCO -- he has merged his political and musical interests to
potent effect.
By calling his concerto The Art of Fugue, Osborne has allowed its
Bachian resonances to speak for themselves. The work was a musical
offering from Britain to Potsdam -- scene of Bach's famous meeting with
Frederick the Great in 1747 (''Gentlemen,'' said the flautist king to
his orchestra, ''Old Bach is come'') -- and it was written in 1993 in
celebration of the German town's 1000th anniversary.
A fortnight-long education project, featuring Osborne and members of
the SCO, took place in local schools using The Art of Fugue as a model.
The visit culminated in the work's world premiere at the Sans Souci
Palace.
Its first British performances take place in St Andrews, Edinburgh and
Aberdeen on January 11, 12 and 13. Ursula Smith will be the solo
cellist, Jukka-Pekka Saraste the conductor, and the work will be
preceded aptly enough by the contrapuntal splendour of Beethoven's
Grosse Fuge.

APROJECT to provide Edinburgh International Festival with a permanent
year-round presence in the city was launched today when festival
director Mr Brian McMaster submitted an application for #3.9m from the
Millennium funding allocation of National Lottery proceeds.
The proposal is to convert the Highland-Tolbooth Church, which
occupies a commanding position at the top of the Royal Mile, just below
Edinburgh Castle, into a Festival Centre, providing a new headquarters
for the festival incorporating performance and exhibition space.
The A-listed building was built as the Assembly Hall for the Church of
Scotland and is still owned by the Kirk, although it has lain empty for
many years. The current leaseholder is Heritage Projects, the company
which created the Yorvik Centre in York.
It is planned that the redevelopment of the building would be
sufficiently advanced to allow it to open to mark the festival's 50th
anniversary in 1997, although it would not be completed until the
following year. It will include an all-year Festival Club, a cafe, and
the festival box office.
Edinburgh architectural firm Benjamin Tindall has produced designs for
the centre as part of a feasibility study which costed it at #7m. Under
Millennium Commission rules matching funding has to be available from
other sources, but #1.6m is already in place from Heritage Projects in
the shape of continuing work on the building.
The balance will come from public-sector partners -- Edinburgh
District Council and Lothian Regional Council and Lothian and Edinburgh
Enterprise have already pledged their support -- and private sources.
The centre will operate commercially with profits being returned to the
festival.
Mr McMaster said: ''The Festival Centre will give the festival the
opportunity to build further on its success, by giving us a year-round
presence in the city and acting as a real home for both local supporters
and visitors. We hope to create a lively and welcoming building that
will be a real asset to the city and its festivals.''

Glasgow Royal Concert Hall's second Celtic Connections season, which
begins this week, looks well on course to emulate -- if not outstrip --
its innovative predecessor, reports Rob Adams
THE Poozies have sold out. And by the time this newspaper hits the
stands, in all probability the Rankin Family, Eleanor McEvoy, the
Fureys, and Kathy Mattea and Dougie Maclean will have followed suit.
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall's Celtic Connections -- the Second
Gathering is well on course to emulate, if not outstrip, the outstanding
success of its predecessor last year.
The 1994 version had its critics and there were those who doubted the
wisdom of staging such a large-scale celebration of music which
previously had been confined to smaller-scale operations (and no, I
haven't forgotten that I was one of the doubters). But you can't, as
that charming promoter's aphorism has it, argue with bums on seats.
This year's event is bigger. It lasts longer. It has an extra venue in
the Hospitality Inn's Grand Ballroom, and to those who argued for more
participatory events it has paid far more than lip service with a host
of workshops in everything from the ancient carynx (a forerunner of the
modern trombone apparently) to unaccompanied singing. From carynx to
larynx, you might say.
With ceilidhs (tickets for which are gaining gold-dust status),
morning concerts, and the Celtic Conversations series added to the
nightly main-stage events, we are talking here of one mighty boost to
traditional music.
It is fair to say that the Celtic connections have been stretched to
the peripheries in some cases, but essentially this is still a
celebration of tradition-based music -- and a well-marketed celebration,
not to say one given the hard sell, at that.
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall staff are coy on such matters, but even at
a conservative guess, this must be a #250,000 event, an unprecedented,
in my experience, investment in this music in this country. In the
continued absence of any sensible interest in traditional music from
existing funding bodies, you really have to take your hat off to the
concert hall.
There are those who say this is not the proper place for such music to
be played. I can't agree with them. What kind of venues do they think
our bands and singers play on those interminable tours of Germany and
the US that keep them solvent?
Folk clubs do a great job in nurturing talent, and it is a tribute to
their dedicated organisers that so many of them still flourish. But
today's audiences, drawn to the music by the sense of fun and
participation that they have picked up during the ceilidh boom, and pop
music's increased plasticisation, are used to concerts that are
organised on, dare I say, more professional lines.
They might have been to the SECC or Barrowland the week before (since
they have refreshingly little truck with the compartmentalising of
music), and the acts that fill those venues are the ones that
traditional music is competing against quite successfully these days.
Folk clubs are also a bit too cosy, their obligatory encore system,
albeit well intentioned, being ultimately no spur to performers. What
better motivation, then, to make our up-and-coming musicians and singers
go that extra mile towards achieving excellence than the possibility of
a gig at a recognised centre of excellence, a place that -- at long last
-- takes traditional music as seriously as classical orchestras and
opera singers?
Not that I've anything against opera, but if those clowns down in
Ayrshire, who were planning to invite Pavarotti to celebrate the 200th
anniversary of our national bard's death in 1996, care to pop into
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall over the next couple of weeks, they will hear
more than one first-rate interpreter of Burns. None of them will cost an
arm and a leg, and each will, given proper, Celtic Connections-style
promotion, put bums on seats.

IN Edinburgh they may go in for pagan rituals atop Calton Hill, but
doon by the Broomielaw the shape of the Christmas present is as well
defined as ever. The fans know how a Singing Kettle show should go and
Cilla, Artie and Gary aren't about to tamper with the formula.
This time it is a Giant Christmas Present that mutates into various
guises to form the set, each with a suitably attired kettle which
contains the clue to the next number. It all makes perfect sense, but
like the best kids' entertainment when baldly described it sounds as if
it could only be thought up by someone under the influence of exotic
cheroots. But by putting the emphasis so firmly on the music, The
Singing Kettle has avoided having to maintain even the flimsiest of plot
lines.
The problem the trio do have is the one of the mega-successful rock
band -- how do you promote the new album to an audience that really
wants to hear your greatest hits? Frankly, I was happy to have been
spared Bunny Fou Fou, but I suspect I was in the minority. All the old
favourites made an appearance: The Jeely Piece Song (with daft
costumes), Wee Wille Winkie, and the touching Ah'm No Hairy Mary, Ah'm
Yer Maw.
You can't win as an adult though. Sit still and you are ridiculed,
join in and Cilla admonishes: ''I was talking to the children!''
* There are extra daytime performances of The Giant Christmas Present
from January 10 to 13.

NEW Year greetings from the Royal SNO last night in a journey through
the history of the most enduring of all dance forms -- the waltz. From
its Viennese beginnings through to present-century Hollywood classics,
the capacity audience enjoyed a rich and varied selection capable of
sending any toe into tapping mode. An evening of waltzes is always going
to include a fair share of contributions from the formidable Strauss
family. After a ropey start in a questionable Tiomkin arrangement of The
Great Waltz, the band settled into a frothy rendition of Sphaerenklange,
conductor Stephen Barlow transferring the grandeur of the Viennese
ballroom to the stage with tremendous enthusiasm.
Scottish soprano Rosalind Sutherland gave a charming account of the
Laughing Song from Die Fledermaus, impressive in the upper register
turns and trills.
After the Viennese experience of the first half, the spotlight turned
to Hollywood. The Overture Waltz from Carousel lost me in a broad sweep
of nostalgia, furthered by three vocal gems from the Broadway crown sung
by Rosalind Sutherland.
Second half highlight was a collection of Waxman's Cafe Waltzes from
Hotel Berlin. Rich and imaginative, these are waltzes with brains.

Parliamentary correspondent Stephen McGregor looks at the background
to Labour's fumbled school fees saga
HE knew what he was doing, this hero of the Tribunite left, now known
as the traditionalist left or the moderate left. Mr David Blunkett,
given the spokesmanship for education a few weeks ago in Tony Blair's
''new look'' Labour Party, was asserting erstwhile values uncongenial to
the Labour leader.
He was indulging himself in old-fashioned socialist kite-flying. This
is out of order in the Blair regime. Mr Blunkett was caught out by the
media in sloppy thinking on the possible taxation of independent
schools. Flying a flag for the Labour left is a temptation that Mr
Blunkett must now resist.
He had to be slapped down, and quickly. If the Blunkett blunder had
been left unaddressed, even for a couple of hours, Mr Blair's new vision
could have been undermined.
For example, other Shadow Cabinet members may have been encouraged to
float ideas that had not been approved of by the leadership. Blunkett's
place in the party is important to Mr Blair. He is an ally in the cause
of getting a Labour government. But the education policy debacle
reasserts Mr Blair's strategic predominance in the political battle for
the disaffected Tory middle-class vote.
Blair is the expert on this, Blunkett is not. Blair's savage rebuttal
of Blunkett is calculated to remind him that he can no longer call the
shots as he did when in charge of Sheffield City Council.
There are few figures who attract more sympathy around Westminster
than Mr Blunkett who, as everyone knows, is blind. When he walks into
the Commons chamber, his guide-dog leading the way, MPs always make way
for him and make sure he is properly steered to his place on the front
bench.
But Blunkett does not want sympathy or any special treatment either
from his colleagues at Westminster or from the press. He is a
professional politician who has come up through the hard school and who
neither seeks nor gives any quarter.
All of which has meant that he has well and truly been put in the
front line over what can only be described as a classic political
cock-up last weekend when confusion reigned over Labour's education
policy. He may yet pay a high political price.
On the issue of imposing VAT on private school fees, he was quoted as
saying: ''I am ruling nothing out at this stage because we want to look
at the two issues of charitable status and VAT on private school fees
together so that we can see what would be fairest.''
But with Labour seeking desperately to appeal to middle and upper
middle-class voters who might well want to send their children to
private school and who would be horrified by any plans to impose VAT on
school fees, the Labour leadership got cold feet with which, unusually,
they rapidly stepped in.
According to Labour insiders, alarm bells starting ringing in the
hierarchy as soon as the Blunkett quotes broke in the newspapers early
on Sunday morning and were then backed up by TV and radio reports.
The heavyweights moved in, with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown ordering
that the record be set straight. Blair is understood to have spoken
personally on the phone to Mr Blunkett about the matter.
By lunchtime, Blunkett was back on the television screens repudiating
any moves to extend VAT to school fees, making clear he was acting on
the instructions of Blair and Brown. ''The Shadow Chancellor and the
leader of the party think it is helpful to rule out that possibility in
order to avoid confusion,'' he found himself saying.
This undoubtedly is the first policy shambles Labour has faced under
Tony Blair's new-look leadership and has the Tories understandably
cock-a-hoop. There clearly will have to be much more of this kind of
thing if the Tories are to take back the initiative from Labour, but
opinion at Westminster last night was that as concentration focuses more
on specific policies, there may be more potential for problems.
In the current Labour atmosphere, where the party hierarchy is anxious
that no-one should rock the boat in the build-up to the next election,
Blunkett's remarks were unfortunate, but they may well give a foretaste
of a further problem that Mr Blair will have to face over the next year
or two -- the split between left and right.
Blunkett, MP for Sheffield Brightside and a former leader of Sheffield
City Council, still is displaying left-wing attitudes which could either
be a unifying force or, depending on the view taken by Mr Blair and his
senior lieutenants, could see him dumped in pursuit of the wider goal.
The left clearly like him. Left-winger Llew Smith, MP for Blanau
Gwent, accused the leadership of acting like Robin Hood in reverse --
robbing the poor to subsidise the rich. But John Evans, MP for St Helens
North, said: ''David is a very able man, but he does have the habit of
making policy on the hoof, which can be very costly.''
Blunkett is described in one of the books of parliamentary profiles as
a ''passionate but pragmatic exponent of municipal socialism and
opponent of centralisation''. An anti-factionalist of the semi-hard or
firm left, it is said he tried to get former Labour leader Neil Kinnock
into the broad left rather then the right, and he has been quoted as
saying (somewhat vaguely): ''I agree with Tony Benn on some things and
disagree with him on others.''
He joined the Labour Party at 16 in Shropshire, was elected a
Sheffield city councillor in May 1970 and became an MP in June 1987.
Well before that he had established himself as a darling of the
audiences on BBC's Question Time with his quick wit and obvious
attention to detail, despite his handicap.
He now, however, finds himself in a very much bigger pond where a keen
grasp of policy and an ability to hold the attention of the House is
crucial. He has been through the political mill, both at local and
national level, and few would disagree with one description of him as
''one of the few genuine orators in contemporary British politics'', or
with the phrase that his ''massive personal resilience and drive,
necessary to achieve so much against the odds, is a triumph of willpower
and individuality''.
But former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once said that Mr Blunkett was
''good at skating on thin ice'', and such a strategy will not do in the
new-look Labour Party.
Blunkett said of himself in 1988: ''The objective has to be to get a
Labour government. But I have a personal aspiration -- to be able to
remain a person, a man, with all the feelings and aspirations and hopes
that people have outside politics.
''I say that because so often it does envelop people and we become
almost artificial in the way we live our lives. That would be my hope:
to share a bit of happiness and the normality of life, while being
effective as a politician.
''Many people think that if you are not subsumed by politics you can't
get anywhere. I think it is the other way round. To be effective you
need to laugh a little.''
Hopefully, after the events of the past few days, Mr Blunkett will
still be able to laugh a little.

Margaret Vaughan foresees a new assault on lone parents
HE is tearing the wings, neatly, off a small beast, she nibbles on
something nutty in gravy. Suddenly there is the snorting noise that
passes for laughter among the humourless. ''. . . so she says she can't
remember who the father is and the court just collapses, but I mean it's
not funny really, not when you come to think of it, I mean, after all
we're the ones who're paying to keep these single-parent families . .
.''
It might be a Dickensian cameo. He with his winged collar and stripy
breeks, she with her googly eyes and winsome giggle.
But it's the words of Disraeli that echo in the mind when he wrote of
two nations which were as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts, and
feelings as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of
different planets.
Now, 150 years on, here we are eavesdropping on some Edinburgh
lawyers, out to lunch; listening to a latter-day delineation of the
divide. Last year's rabid political debates on lone parents were shaped
by a vulgar right-wing populism: all those scroungers producing babies
on welfare benefit were rearing a generation of delinquents.
No matter that the Government's own figures showed no evidence of
seething masses of silly girlies giving birth to babies to get a council
house, never mind that the majority of lone parents were divorced or
widowed, the stigma stuck.
The demonology of right-wing rhetoric depends, of course, on erecting
a barrier between two types of poor, the deserving and the undeserving.
The deserving poor are threadbare but decent. In the socio-babble of
radical right-wing US academic circles the supposed undeserving poor
became ''the underclass''.
Now the champions of Family Values, including the Neanderthal wing of
the back benches, have been given potent new ammunition with which to
renew the attack.
Yesterday saw the publication of another report from the right-wing
think tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, which accuses the
Government of discriminating against married couples and working fathers
in favour of lone parents.
Now marriage, according to researcher Patricia Morgan, has become an
''unaffordable luxury''. Her report, entitled Farewell to the Family?,
purports to show that state support for lone mothers is leading to the
decline of marriage.
She paints an apocalyptic vision of a ''warrior class'' of unattached,
renegade young men for whom status is defined by predatory sexual
behaviour and violent seizure of other people's property.
For, Ms Morgan argues, young women can do better by having children
alone, outside marriage, and by living on benefits.
A lone parent, according to her report, could take home more than a
married father with the same number of children despite the fact that
the father's income supported an additional adult. The Government's new
childcare allowance will, she claims, make the situation even worse.
The report says that a lone mother with two small children could work
for 20 hours at #4 an hour and end up with a net income of #163 after
rent and tax. In contrast, a married father with two small children
working for 40 hours at the same rate would have #130 -- receiving #33
less for working full-time than the mother does for part-time work.
She wrote: ''What sort of message is this sending to young people who
are planning their lives? Instead of encouraging them to think in terms
of making a permanent commitment to a partner to bring up children in a
stable environment, we seem to be saying to them, don't get married . .
.
''For many people, especially at the bottom of the earnings scale,
marriage has become an unaffordable luxury. They would lose more in
benefits than the husband's income could compensate for.''
It looks convincing. It is, however, hooey. Even the Department of
Social Security, a not disinterested department, was able to produce
figures showing that, at any level of full-time weekly earnings between
#100 and #300, a lone parent will in future be worse off than a married
man.
According to Professor Adrian Sinfield, who heads the Department of
Social Policy at Edinburgh University, the crux of the problem is not in
piffling arguments over who is grabbing more of the welfare kitty. It is
that so many more people are sinking into poverty.
''What concerns me is the enormous slide into poverty for low-income
families, with or without single parents at their head.''
The Government's own figures, he says, show poverty has increased
enormously. Since 1979 in real terms the income of the bottom 10% of the
population has fallen by 17%. The top 10% have gone up by 62%.
''What should concern us is the gap that is widening between the poor
and the better-off.'' In 1979 those living on an income of half the
national average amounted to 9%. In 1991 it was 25%, after housing
costs.
Professor Sinfield argues that while cuts in welfare state programmes
fall particularly on lower-income families, greater security for
better-off families is achieved by the direct and indirect effects of
substantial public subsidies through the tax ystem.
While the focus has been on the amount spent on welfare benefits, less
visible subsidies given to the better-off through the tax system are
ignored. One specific example he cites is the #9000m of taxpayers' money
used by Government last year to subsidise private pensions. Tax
allowances for married couples cost #4600m last year and mortgage
interest a further #4300m.
Donald Dewar, MP, Labour's spokesman on social security, described the
examples used in the report as a ''nasty oversimplification''.
''Of course if you work part-time and get family credit, it is
hypothetically possible to construct a case where someone might on paper
appear better off. But it is entirely misleading because for a start the
woman is trapped on that income level.''
Nor will she have any of the benefits in kind that come from full-time
work. ''It doesn't matter how she improves her earnings, she will never
be better off because every extra pound will be knocked off against her
benefits.''
The imperative has to be to get people out of poverty, with all the
battering it gives to families, by getting them into work. ''To abandon
people to a life without work is to abandon them to poverty.''

THE release of government files after 30 years comes as an annual boon
to hard-pressed editors in the run-up to New Year. On that most barren
of news days, they provide an advance package of stories from memory
lane; complete with nostalgic shots of Supermac, Harold Wilson, and
youthful Beatles.
To that extent, the newly opened files fulfill a similar journalistic
role to the honours list, which the media can also set its calendars by.
But they are much more important than that nonsense. For they shed at
least a little light on the realities of how government operates, and
the lessons should not be ignored.
The most interesting material in this week's batch concerned the
hand-over of power from Sir Alec Douglas-Home to Harold Wilson in 1964,
and it scarcely enhances the concept of a non-political Civil Service.
We learn that the principal private secretary at 10 Downing Street had
been working hand-in-glove with the Tories on their ''costing'' of
Labour's plans in the run-up to the election.
Senior civil servants disparaged Wilson to Tory Ministers in advance
of the 1964 poll. ''Mr Wilson's head, big though it is getting, is not
quite big enough yet to enable him to have talks with the Civil
Service,'' sneered one impartial mandarin. When Labour won, they sought
to box him in with the most restrictive options about both the conduct
and policies of government. Where Wilson demurred, they sent each other
exasperated memos and doubtless took preventive action to match.
There is plentiful evidence of the subsequent campaigns which were
undertaken to destabilise and undermine Wilson's governments. Latterly,
he may have grown paranoid, but that doesn't mean he was wrong. We must
await such records as government chooses to release on the activities of
the intelligence services, but there is already adequate confirmation
that Wilson had plenty to be paranoid about.
The ''politicisation'' of the Civil Service over the past
decade-and-a-half is often referred to. The implication is that
mandarins of the old school were above that kind of thing, and existed
only to serve the elected government of the day. I doubt it very much.
There were and are many in the upper echelons of Whitehall who see a
Labour government as an avoidable threat to the Establishment of which
they are themselves inextricably part.
It is dangerous to swallow whole any chapter of the textbook
self-esteem about how the British constitution operates. As one who
observes aspects of its functioning at close hand, I am regularly
reminded just how much it requires a comprehensive gutting to become
more democratic, open, accountable, and therefore relevant to the people
who live under it. We might even start by writing it down, together with
a Bill of Rights.
The corollary of this view is that there must be interests which are
vested in absolutely nothing changing. For them, the British
constitution is the most perfect star in the firmament; festooned in
flummery and serving the sacred purpose of retaining power and status in
the hands of those who were born to occupy these roles. This is the
cause that John Major, the boy from Brixton, has chosen to champion --
and how silly it looks.
It is important to appreciate that Mr Major's constitutional
strictures do not apply only to Scottish and Welsh devolution.
Everything, in his view, is just tickety-boo. All England, too, is
sublimely served. The House of Lords, with its 1000-plus Tory majority,
''works very well''. The idea of a less extravagant monarchy sends his
Ministers into near-orgasmic fits of orchestrated indignation. Electoral
reform is too absurd to contemplate.
From the Sir Humphreys of Whitehall, through the ermined ranks of
hereditary peers, right down to the last flunkey at Buckingham Palace,
all is not only well but incapable of being improved upon. And to bring
forward proposals which challenge that view is, he squeaks, ''one of the
most dangerous things I have ever heard of''. I doubt if much flesh
crept, even among the target audiences of Basildon and Surbiton.
The argument that devolution could break up the UK carried some
weight, as I am well qualified to recall, in the late 1970s. What Mr
Major chooses to ignore, in his clutching at patriotic straws, is that
the manner in which power has been exercised over the past 15 years has
created a far stronger threat, which places the risks and anomalies
inherent in change in a very different perspective.
In his own smug analysis, the ''danger'' to the country's unity and
future lies in advocacy of a package of constitutional reform which
might breathe some life, integrity, and credibility into institutions
which are either ridiculed, despised or ignored. It is not a message
which carries much resonance or sense of realism.
Of course each individual aspect of constitutional reform will require
to be argued for vigorously, rigorously, and in every corner of the
country. But even more fundamentally, it is the vision of change and
modernity, to strengthen the country and prepare it for a new century,
that requires to be promoted. There is a big market for that message,
and it is by no means restricted to Scotland.

I welcome the Rev Dr MacDonald's riposte to Ian Bell but wish to
expand it (December 29).
First, for Paul's use of genomenon in the phrase in Galatians about
Jesus' birth the modern NRSV and RSV still use ''born of (a) woman''
rather than KJV and Vulgate ''made (factum) of a woman''.
Neither ''born'' nor ''made'' in this context tells us anything
conclusive about virginal conception.
Besides, in Romans 1:3 genomenou (Vulgate again factus) is used to
indicate that Jesus was of the ''seed of David according to the flesh''
-- suggesting (even if nothing more) that Joseph was not without genetic
influence -- and the next phrase tends to link divine sonship with the
resurrection as a divine spiritual act of power where one might have
expected an explicit reference to virginal conception.
Secondly Luke, the Gentile historian, was obliged to use second-hand
Semitic sources in his early chapters.
Much depends on the way the original story-tellers thought --
poetically, mythically, analytically, or what you will.
I have no doubt Luke was a sincere historian, but Luke is dependent on
his sources and on the mental equipment he had for discriminating among
them -- and these sources can be thought of as steeped in the
traditional Jewish methodology of story-telling later known as haggadah
-- devotional admixtures of history, scriptural allusions, and pious
imagination, pointing behind themselves to other truths.
Thirdly, the Church Fathers inherited an already established set of
written documents -- certainly from the time of Irenaeus -- and with
them too we have to make allowances for devotional thinking.
It follows that the verdict on Mary's virginal conception is likely to
be ''not proven''. If it helps to believe in the Virgin Birth, so be it.
But I opt primarily for the gospel of repentance and loving concern
(without denying that God can act as he wishes, and without closing the
book on his ability to act through Mary): there we are on as firm ground
as a crucifixion can provide.

I read with some astonishment the claim by Mr Jim Wallace, MP,
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, that ''there was no reason why the tax
rate could not actually go down'' under a devolved Scottish parliament
with the power to vary personal tax rates by up to 3%.
Mr Wallace has, as Kenneth Clarke might put it, a brass neck to claim
that tax rates could be lower under any devolved Scottish parliament
while he, along with all his other Opposition chums in Scotland, has
spent the past 15 years systematically brainwashing the people of this
country into believing that the Government underfunds our public
services and utilities when the opposite is true.
For Mr Wallace now to suggest that a devolved Scottish parliament
could lead to lower taxes when he has spent most of the past 15 years
arguing for more, not less, money to be spent on items such as education
and health highlights the weakness of his argument.
Mr Wallace should be under no illusion, a devolved parliament with
power to vary personal tax rates will inevitably lead to people in
Scotland paying more in income tax than people living south of the
Border.
As for the Government, it has nothing to fear in bringing the Scottish
constitutional issue to the top of the political agenda, indeed it has
everything to gain from it.

Your readers might appreciate an outline of events relevent to Dr
Harry Burns' proposal to close the Western Infirmary in Glasgow
(December 21). Sadly, the site alone has outlived its usefulness.
Built between 1871-74, its siting served the new fashionable West End
and maintained a link with the university, which had just moved from the
College Green off the High Street to Gilmorehill.
The Royal Infirmary was the university hospital in Lister's period
(1860-69). His next appointment was the chair of clinical surgery at
Edinburgh with wards at its Royal Infirmary. He was spared the turmoil
caused by the move westwards of the old yoonie.
The rift over academic status between the Royal and the Western
engendered many an anecdote. The Western was a parvenu and admittedly
not royalty, yet it was the premier teaching hospital. Caricatured by Dr
O H Mavor (James Bridie) of the Victoria Infirmary, the stories are now
folklore.
By the 1950s it was the Western's turn to worry about its future. The
options were: either to demolish the old building and re-build on the
site or move the lot to pastures new. The staff were so divided that the
then regional hospital board embarked on what was a compromise rather
than a plan. Gartnavel General was designed to relieve the Western of
non-acute cases and receive any acute case treated at the Western in
need of further care. Why it was given an identity likely to be confused
with Gartnavel Royal, a psychiatric hospital, is hard to say.
The Western's baronial pile is almost gone and the surrounding area
dilapidated. When the mainly professorial staff look eastwards to the
Royal and its proximity to Strathclyde University and the regenerated
Merchant City, they must feel trapped in a time-warp.
The service to residents west of the city centre has a new name -- the
West Glasgow Hospitals and University NHS Trust. It now needs a
flagship.
A last word about staff who added to the city's lustre. This year the
Western pathologists celebrated their centenary. Two surgeons were
world-famous; Sir William Macewen was offered the professorial chair at
the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, but chose to stay in Glasgow. As
for Sir Charles Illingworth, he will be remembered by the number of
professors he begat and one changeling, the Chief Medical Officer, UK,
Dr Kenneth Calman.

Incandescent with rage, I write regarding Meek on Monday and the cheap
and snide remarks about the Euro-rebels -- and particularly my good
friend Teddy Taylor.
If, as Brian Meek claims, he is at the grassroots of Tory opinion then
he must live on another planet where Europhobes are thick on the ground,
because they are virtually a non-existent species in Scotland.
To blame the public perception of the Tories on the media and the
Euro-rebels and not consider the factors of broken tax promises, the
''cash for questions'' episode, moral conduct of Tory MPs, and many
other elements is so incredulous that Brian Meek is suffering from an
overdose of Tory Central Office propaganda.
Let Brian Meek enjoy his Euro-vac prior to the local elections because
after them he will have lots of time to spend with his German, French,
and Italian friends in his beloved Europe.
As a parting thought could Brian Meek have any vested interest in the
UK remaining in Europe?

James Robertson's report about the Rev Ronald Christie's claim that
Flower of Scotland is too martial, strident, and arrogant (December 29)
would surely have been more suitable for publication on April 1.
How long is it since the minister last sang the third verse of the
British national anthem? Perhaps I could be permitted to remind him of
the words:
God grant that Marshall Wade,
By Thy Almight aid,
May victory bring.
May he sedition hush,
And like a torrent rush,
Rebellious Scots to crush,
God save the Queen.
There is a fair bit of martial arrogance and stridency there, I would
have thought, although I cannot recall any Free Church publication
attacking this glorification of a state attacking its own people.
Perhaps the hissing down of the British anthem at rugby and soccer
matches could be lessened by officially removing this verse.
If Mr Christie is concerned about dangerous chauvinism then perhaps he
should turn his thoughts to the annual frenzy of union flag waving
jingoism at the Royal Albert Hall's proms when the unofficial English
national anthem, Land of Hope and Glory, with its glorification of
colonialism and conquest, is bellowed out with exultation by thousands.
Flower of Scotland commemorates a quarter century of struggle by
ordinary folk against foreign imperialist tyranny. When the day comes
when we do ''see their likes again'' we will have moved forward as a
nation and unburdened ourselves of the colonial cringe which Mr Christie
so effectively expresses.

January 1.
May I ask all readers who are drivers, and who do not do this already,
to switch on their headlights whenever visibility is the least reduced
by rain, snow, an overcast sky, mist, or fog.
There are countries where this is the law and where most drivers have
their headlights on all the time, throughout the year, even in bright
sunshine.
It saves lives, injuries, and vehicle damage.
Most sidelights are quite inadequate to help pedestrians and other
road users to see a vehicle in any conditions.
I suggest that it should be a criminal offence not to have headlights
on in conditions of poor visibility, whether there is street lighting on
or not.
In my opinion, based on experience, the current Highway Code
recommendations for the use of lights are inadequate.

J C Johnston falls into the snare of assuming that the Neo-Darwinist
hypothesis is actually a fact of life (December 26).
Evolution or scientific naturalism is no more than a belief and is
widely regarded today as a sort of religion. It is of course flatly
contradicted by the fossil record.
Many adherents also admit that they accept the idea because, for them,
it would be unthinkable to believe in a Creator God.
What is generally not appreciated is that the ''molecules-to-man''
scenario requires very much more time than the theory allows. And yet
extra time would bring extra scope for extra harmful diversity.
The current findings of the Hubble Telescope in space have created a
real upset in that the ''apparent'' age of the universe has been
dramatically reduced from 15 to only eight billion years.
As this is in conflict with the previous belief, some scientists now
suggest that these Hubble results are simply wrong.
''Mindset'' does play a vital part in dating schemes.

RUSSIAN reverses in the street fighting for Grozny, the capital of the
breakaway Caucasian republic of Chechnya, may not have too much military
significance, especially when compared with their political and
diplomatic consequences. There does seem to have been remarkably poor
military planning. The city was neither sealed off (thus ensuring its
easy reinforcement by the Chechens) nor assaulted in the manner required
for street fighting. Faulty strategy and tactics alike ensured that the
Russian forces received a bloody nose; but they ought to be able easily
to repeat their effort, and in a more systematic manner since they enjoy
superiority of numbers and equipment. The latter may even have misled
them into believing that they could capture Grozny on the cheap, but
armour alone cannot take cities; elite troops, trained for urban
warfare, are what is needed. The Russians do have them but have been
remiss in not using them, probably through under-estimating their
opponents. It seems that the Russian forces lack the motivation
essential to troops risking their lives. By contrast the Chechens seem
enthused by nationalism. In that, however, lies one of the Russians'
main reasons for persisting in their efforts to crush the secession:
similar sentiments exist in other small republics or autonomous regions
and, if allowed to flourish fully, will simply fragment further the
Russian state. Mr Yeltsin faces a presidential election next year and
has to consider the domestic political dimension of the Chechnyan
imbroglio all the time. He certainly gave the Chechen leadership a good
deal of rope before resorting to force; and the reason he has enjoyed so
much Western sympathy so far is that few people are under much illusion
about the nature of the Dudayev regime and its criminal connections, in
Chechnya itself certainly and in Moscow probably.
Mr Yeltsin has little alternative but to press on since it is hard to
see him surviving a withdrawal. He has lost his old liberal base of
support, though possible alternatives to him will appeal to the liberals
even less. Those who worry about the impact of these developments on
Russian democracy are right to do so. At the least a successful
Chechnyan campaign will leave the President more dependent than ever on
the armed forces, even though ineptitude more than capacity has
distinguished the Army in particular so far. It could be argued that Mr
Yeltsin has always owed rather a lot to the Army, but he really owes the
authority he enjoys to democracy; further reliance on the Army may allow
him to go on ignoring the Duma, but unable to ignore the generals.
There is always the possibility that Western proposals of diplomatic
intervention could appeal to both sides and some formula short of a
fight to the finish could be found to replace another round of street
fighting and air bombing. The limitations of that approach are very
obvious, however, the main one being that anything less than the
re-incorporation of Chechnya in Russia will be a humiliation for the
Russians, while the Chechens having had their taste of freedom may be
unable to settle even for a generous degree of autonomy.

BRITISH Telecom has been one of the most successful privatisations,
not least because of its regulatory authority Oftel, which has in effect
forced the company to share its profitability with phone users. The
company too has had to encounter the first wave of competition in the
shape of Mercury, the subsidiary of the international telecommunications
giant, Cable and Wireless. Old habits die hard, however; and BT still
acts as if its competition hardly existed and pretends that any charge
reductions are voluntary, whereas the truth is that they are forced by
Oftel. It has just announced an increase double the rate of inflation in
line rental charges, a total which is within the Oftel rules (and right
to the limit allowed). Its claim to be losing money on line rentals is
disputed by the Telecommunications Users Association, an opinion which
might be predictable but which BT ought to address with some numerical
evidence.
Actually the first wave of telecommunications has not proved to be
strong enough for surfing. Mercury has, at the most, taken about 13% of
BT's market and, for all that this slice is cherry-stuffed, the
challenger has not been nearly as profitable as its backers hoped (hence
its recent staff contractions and search for cost efficiencies). A
second wave of competitors is now building up but it is still far from
the shore and is unlikely to make much impact on BT's phone business
before the end of the century. Meanwhile BT's management feels free to
add to consumer costs at rates which must make it harder to restrain
inflation throughout the economy.
The transatlantic call reductions are very welcome. They are, however,
in response to an Oftel instruction for BT to reduce its charges by some
#400m in the year to this summer. It is part of BT's clever marketing
which makes them appear to be even more virtuous. They will cost the
company about #35m, while the line rental increase will bring in an
extra #108m, a net gain of #73m. No wonder comment has been so
deservedly hostile. The beneficiaries of cheaper transatlantic calls are
limited to those who make them, but the victims of the line rental
charges are all telephone users without exception, with business users
being somewhat harder hit than the domestic. Part of the trouble are
BT's huge profits (large even when the capital it employs is
considered).
Telephone number profits may seem appropriate for a telephone business
but they leave a bad taste among those who actually provide them, the
consumers. BT has joined the band of offending public utilities, and
should not have to wonder why many users will simply desert it whenever
the coming opposition out-performs Mercury.

TOP NAMES! Huge Reductions! Never to be Repeated Bargains! Yes, it's
the Diary's Biggest Ever January Sale. For one day only we're
practically giving away some of the finest hand-tooled anecdotes this
side of Tom Shields III -- the Luncheon Years. Look no further for
massive discounts on jokes from old crackers and pointless wee tales
(only #5.99 a square yard) we just made up.
(Mind you, we are prompted to wonder, and not for the first time, why
retailers insist on referring to their ''once-a-year'' January sales. Or
have we overlooked all the other Januarys planned for 1995?) Never mind:
hurry now to our lowest basement where you'll find a genuine, split-new
glossy advertisement from Nirex, those nice radioactive waste-disposal
people, explaining what a grand investment pollution can be, and proving
what a bargain nuclear power still is -- for some.
While most of us face uncertain times, these chaps don't just have
jobs for life, they have jobs for the next 100,000 years. That being so,
they are busy planning to spend #1.9 billion ''excavating the most
meticulously studied block of rock in the world''. In layman's language,
they're digging a #1.9 billion hole.
Not just any hole, but a hole to store our national nuclear heritage
after Nirex has acquired ''a profound understanding of the science of
the Borrowdale Volcanic Group'', near Sellafield in Cumbria. You may
wonder how it comes about that Britain leads the world in holes, but
Nirex's MD, Michael Folger, accentuates the positive: ''In the end the
public -- as taxpayers or electricity consumers -- will be paying and we
owe them both a solution which is safe and value for money.'' And what
could be better, during this season of sales, than a value-for-money
#1.9 billion hole? But be under no illusions. It says here (so it must
be true): ''By no stretch of the imagination is Nirex planning a
''dump.''
Intimate friend
IF that news doesn't make life worth living, why not browse in our
Book Department? Stocks are just in of a title that could change your
life -- or possibly your wife. Author Barbara Keesling obviously doesn't
like to brag and has given her volume the modest title How to Make Love
All Night: Male Multiple Orgasms and Other Secrets for Prolonged
Lovemaking (Optima: #4.99).
Ms Keesling, a sex therapist by trade, is alleged to ''know more about
men's penises than most men do''. Dauntingly, she writes: ''One of the
most rewarding moments for me as a clinician is when a client 'gets it'
for the first time. Obviously I can't be with each and every one of you
right now. But believe me that I am with you in spirit.''
Oh, good. Ms Keesling, it hardly needs to be added, hails from
California.
Cold comfort
WITH the man in her life taken care of, however, it seems only fair
that a woman should be able to start the year with a positive image of
herself, not least if she has, as they say, pigged out recently. There
are many blubber shops ready to separate the corpulent from their cash,
but we were rather taken with the sensitive tone adopted by Lady in
Leisure, an Edinburgh establishment.
Keenly aware of how depressing those extra inches can be, its ad
boasts that members lost ''a massive total of 14,000lbs of fat over the
last year. That'' (just in case you were wondering) ''is seven tonnes --
or the equivalent of a 60ft blue whale''. There, that should make her
feel so much better as she struggles with the new frock.
Bottom line
MEANWHILE, there are amazing offers left in our Political Seconds
Department. Having apologised to the Tories for allowing David Blunkett
even to dream of sticking VAT on private school fees when there are
still plenty of pensioners who haven't frozen to death, Tony Blair now
has John Prescott hogging the limelight with an essay in a new journal
of revolutionary socialism. Or as the Labour deputy puts it, making a
pitch for a regular slot: ''Yes, it's that John Prescott. And I must
admit, I'm as surprised as you are to find myself writing for Tatler.
But a vote's a vote, and I suspect many Tatler readers wasted theirs on
the Tories at the last election. I must be perfectly honest. I have
never read Tatler before, let alone written an article for it.''
Don't imagine for a moment, however, that John has lost his radical
edge, or underestimated the legions of socialists reading Tatler. What
price tax cuts? he thunders, somewhere between pictures of #7000 satin
skirts and #496 Chanel T-shirts.
''And what price when classrooms are crumbling, class sizes are
increasing, and books have to be shared, because energy and resources
have been diverted from teaching children into funding new and
cumbersome bureaucracies?'' Or diverted, come to that, into giving
private schools a bung?
Last words
STILL in the Political Customer Care Department, we hear that American
politics becomes steadily more gracious. Vice-President Gore on
Republican reptile Newt Gingrich: ''Some people approach every problem
with an open mouth''. Attorney-General Janet Reno on crime: ''To make
certain crime doesn't pay, the government should take it over and run
it.'' William Bennett, conservative commentator, on American
civilisation: ''I think it would be a good idea''.
Striking a chord
FINALLY, with a depressing sense of advancing years, we note that next
Sunday would have been Elvis's sixtieth birthday had he not decided to
play pick n'mix with the pharmacopia. To celebrate, we searched our
Music Department for an appropriate Presleyism to prove what a spiritual
and intellectual giant the king really was.
We could think of only one. Asked once for a technical insight into
his art, El replied: ''I don't know much about music. In my business,
you don't have to.''
Uh-uh-uh.

HERE is a tale to start the New Year off which, after all the
frivolity of the festive season, should give everyone pause for
reflection. Last October the European Court of Justice ruled it was
illegal to test someone for Aids against their will. Would that the
ruling had been given before Scottish Amicable, a most reputable
insurance company according to our City Editor, inflicted one on me
without bothering to tell me. I could have had their guts for garters.
Some eight years ago, inspired by Margaret Thatcher's vision of a
second-home-owning democracy, I decided, having a ridiculously small
mortgage, to buy a weekend seaside flat. To do so I raised a second
endowment mortgage on my house, had a medical from the insurance
company's doctor, and waited for the cash. It was slow in coming and I
phoned the Abbey National to ask why.
They said it was because I had not yet seen my own doctor. They were
waiting for me to do that before issuing the cheque. I said nobody had
asked me to see him. I had seen their man as instructed so what was this
all about? Ah, well, they could not say. It was confidential. I must ask
my doctor. I phoned, made an appointment, and he took a blood test. I
asked why? Because you have had hepatitis, he said. That was a good 10
or 12 years previously, but it sounded an adequate reason and I thought
no more about it.
The money arrived, the flat was purchased, and life went on until, on
a whim, I decided to take out an insurance policy offered by Sun Life,
which had arrived as a result of a mail shot. It was a
no-medical-necessary policy, but they asked permission to consult my
medical records held by my GP should they want to do so and I agreed.
Then my GP rang up, having been contacted by them, and I said he could
provide the information. I did not need to authorise him to do so
personally after a certain period of time had elapsed and I did not want
the bother of having to go round to his surgery. He said it would be
better if I signed the release form. I went to see him and was shown my
records. There it was. Aids test. Result. Negative. As it should have
been.
Why was that done? He could not remember. But the result was negative,
so it was all right, wasn't it? It was, of course, that mortgage blood
test four or five years before. I was, putting it as politely as I can,
annoyed by Scottish Amicable's behaviour, but -- short of never taking
out a policy with them again -- what could I do? Complain? To whom? In
the event I seethed privately, and did not take the policy out with the
Sun Life because, being a special offer, I had run out of time.
Apart from anything else I didn't do anything because having the test
carried a stigma at that time which it no longer does.
But I now had an Aids test noted in my records with Sun Life with whom
I have several policies, not a happy state of affairs, as I found a few
months later when I decided to take out a small policy offered by them.
I answered the inevitable question about the test in the affirmative and
was shown the door. Being turned down for an insurance policy is a
serious matter because that sort of decision gets in to one's
credit-rating records.
I fought the rejection, arguing that I had not asked to have the test
done, had not known I had had it done, and it had been negative anyway,
and won. Sun Life issued the policy without a medical on the original
terms. No special price, no qualifications, just a run-of-the-mill,
common or garden policy.
It was only then that I looked carefully at what I had thought was
another of those #10-a-month endowment policies I was in the habit of
taking out occasionally, to find it was one which would pay my funeral
expenses. Given that Aids test I do not complain about Sun Life
wondering what I was up to.
Luckily all this happened long enough ago for me not to have to answer
the question about having had an Aids test in the affirmative ever
again. The time limit has expired. So I can say ''no'' and that is the
end of that. But it is small comfort since I don't envisage at this
stage in my life taking out any more insurance.
The niggling doubts that remain are: what would my doctor, Scottish
Amicable, and the Abbey National, who, after all, picked Scottish
Amicable for my endowment loan, have done had the result been positive?
Would anyone have told me? Or was the information confidential to them?
Ignorance may be bliss, but not that kind of ignorance.
At the very least surely Scottish Amicable should have asked me to
take the test. I could have refused. They had no grounds for asking. The
Abbey National ought also to have revealed why I was being required to
see my own doctor after having seen Scottish Amicable's doctor. My own
GP should not have taken the test without telling me what he was doing.
His subsequent memory lapse was convenient, even if I am an infrequent
patient in a busy practice where such tests could well be two a penny.
What is all that guff, therefore, about nobody taking an Aids test
without counselling being provided? My old granny used to say what you
don't know won't hurt you. Wrong, granny, wrong.

MORE than a thousand jobs will be created in Ayrshire by the turn of
the century if a new tourism strategy finds support and success.
The strategy -- by a group of local authorities backed by the tourist
board and Enterprise Ayrshire -- will this week be circulated to local
tourism operators.
The message in the document is blunt: success will only be created if
everyone in the industry pulls together.
Mr Jack McCorkell, of Cunninghame District Council, said: ''Ayrshire
is slowly changing from the sad and tired tourist image it once had. The
levels of effort must be maintained, though, to ensure we do not slide
back to the bad old days.''
Mr McCorkell, in charge of economic development within the council,
added: ''About five years ago, we had a review of tourism in Ayrshire
which showed the area had about 7% of the Scottish tourist market but
that certain aspects of the product was not right. The area was not
being marketed and promoted properly.''
After some early reluctance, the councils laid aside their traditional
rivalries and worked together for the common cause.
Mr Robin Jackson, head of company development at Enterprise Ayrshire
has been surprised by the level of co-operation.
He said: ''The Ayrshire Tourism Initiative was born and any rivalry
which still exists is healthy rivalry. Not one single local authority
has all the attractions which can hold the tourist for the whole of a
visit but between them they have more than enough.''
Mr Jackson picked up on the warning given in the strategy document
Towards 2000 and expanded it.
''We must guard against any complacency. Ayrshire has gone against the
national trend and consistently shown a modest increase in visitor
figures. It would be all too easy to let that slip.''
He pointed to training schemes available such as the Welcome Host
initiative and grants for bringing accommodation up to scratch.
Tourism brings more than #185m a year to the Ayrshire economy and
employs about 7% of the workforce.
Scotland remains the largest source of visitors, with England next and
the North American continent some way behind.
The aims of the strategy are:
* Expenditure to rise to at least 8% of Scottish total by 2000.
* Proportion of overseas visitors to rise from 7% to 10%.
* Wider season spread and higher winter occupancy rates.
* Hotel and catering employment up from 9000 to 10,000 with spin-off
benefits.
Mr McCorkell said that the private sector had a huge part to play in
providing good accommodation and food which discerning visitors will
enjoy and tell their friends about.
Mr Jackson agreed: ''This is a partnership which must work and which
will work only with the co-operation of everyone who is involved in the
industry. We cannot afford to lose one visitor and we could have many
more given the will and a little application.''
Meanwhile, Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise has announced measures to
help the tourist industry in its area.
Assistance will be available for upgrading small hotels or guest
houses with the programme aimed mainly at the 20-bedroom or below range.
Director of development David Waring said: ''Tourism is a key sector
in Dumfries and Galloway and represents 7.6% of available jobs with
tourism spend locally around #70m per annum.
''We recognise the importance of the tourism sector in terms of
creating local jobs and in contributing to the national economic wealth.
''The quality our product and service is a crucial issue in attracting
our markets and this programme seeks to maintain and improve on our
current standards.
''We have allocated #118,000 in this year's budget for this programme
and the 50% grants are based on a minimum #2500 and maximum #30,000
investment from the private sector.''

MILITANT vegetarianism on the march or an expression of legitimate
concern for a cruel and unnecessary trade? The campaign against live
animal exports to Europe reached a new low yesterday as a group of
animal rights activists in Shoreham rattled and beat the sides of
lorries containing 200 doubtless terrified calves and prevented them
from being loaded on to a cargo ship.
Instead of a short trip to the Continent, the animals were subjected
to several hours of being hurtled around the back streets of the West
Sussex port in a bid to avoid the demonstrators. In terms of animal
welfare, the incident looked distinctly like an own goal for the
militants.
Meanwhile, more compaigners continued to besiege the home of Chris and
Maria Bart-Jolly, whose company leased the Boeing 737 which crashed last
week after returning from a calf delivery trip to Holland.
Farmers have appeared to stand by helplessly as the campaign against
live exports went from strength to strength. In October, cross-Channel
ferry operators P &amp; O joined Stena Sealink's live trade ban. When
transporters turned to the airports, so did the demonstrators.
Carlisle airport banned live exports and, after initial prevarication
and a high-profile protest, so did Prestwick. Coventry airport is the
latest target, along with ports like Shoreham which have continued to
export lambs and calves in cargo ships.
This is not one campaign but two. The first is against the export of
calves. Though many of these end up on Italian dinner plates, most are
fattened and slaughtered in France and Holland, relatively close to the
Channel ports. The issue here is not so much transportation as the
confining of young calves for short miserable lives in crates of the
kind banned in the UK in 1990.
For lambs, the problem is long arduous journeys, to grim
slaughterhouses in Spain, southern France and Italy, often in blistering
heat and frequently without proper stops for food and water. Some
particularly iniquitous examples have been exposed by the RSPCA.
However, now farmers are fighting back. Yesterday irate livestock
owners urged Home Secretary Michael Howard and Agriculture Minister
William Waldegrave to intervene and defend the exports. ''Nobody opposes
orderly demonstrations, but blatant interference with a legal trade must
not be tolerated or we will be subject to mob rule,'' said Mr Bob Parry,
president of the Farmers' Union of Wales.
Last week, Stewartry farmer Ronnie Wilson accused the National
Farmers' Union of failing to put across the farmers' views. As a result,
campaigners -- ''basically urban terrorists'' -- were portrayed as the
good guys, while the farmers were seen as the baddies, he said.
However, Mr Stewart Whiteford, livestock convenor of the Scottish NFU,
says it is virtually impossible to have a public debate with animal
rights campaigners because of their refusal to compromise. The live
export ban, he says, is the thin end of the wedge.
Next they will want maximum journey times within the UK to be reduced
to eight hours from the current 15, a move which could cause particular
problems to Scottish sheep farmers from the islands and other remote
areas. Their ultimate goal, he says, is to turn us into a nation of
vegetarians and put all non-arable farmers out of business.
And although most people still eat meat, he says ''an understanding
gap'' has opened up between farmers and the public because the food
production chain has become so long and complex. ''Somehow we have to
mobilise the meat-eating public on our side but it's hard to know
exactly how,'' Mr Whiteford says.
So far, the ferry and airport bans have had minimal impact on Scottish
farmers. Very few calves in Scotland go to the Continent for veal
production. Male calves from dairy cows generally go into the beef
chain. There is a trade in what the trade calls ''light lambs'', mainly
to France and Spain, but the season for these ended in September before
the ferry ban began to bite.
Scottish farmers might be well advised to stick to campaigning on
lamb. The hypocrisy of banning veal crates in Britain, then allowing
British farmers to sell their calves into crate systems in France and
Holland, and British wholesalers to re-import the meat thus produced is
not lost on a well-informed British public. How many of us eat veal
these days?
The lamb question is less clearcut. The rationalisation of
slaughterhouse provision in Britain, plus the remoteness of many farming
communities, means that lambs are already often carted great distances
anyway. Mr Whiteford says new evidence shows that sheep can be carried
over very long distances without suffering significant stress, provided
they are properly handled.
The NFU has long argued that the Government should concentrate its
fire on effective enforcement of existing legislation to root out the
cowboys who attract bad publicity to the whole industry. However, Mr
Waldegrave discovered when he tried to press a compromise on animal
welfare at the EU farm Ministers' meeting in October that some member
states simply do not regard farm animals as having rights. Chief
offenders are Greece, Italy and Spain.
Meanwhile, the ferry ban has thrown up some strange anomalies.
Scots-born Ian Davison, who now farms near Dover, used to take his heavy
rams to the nearest slaughterhouse which would take them: yes, Calais.
He could take an early ferry and be home for lunch. Since the ban, he
has had to take them much farther away.
Mr John Callaghan, spokesman for Compassion in World Farming, the
pressure group in several of the recent protests, denies that such cases
make a nonsense of the campaign: ''The campaign is aimed at the many
thousands of lambs brought huge distances from places like Scotland and
face another long journey across Europe. They should be slaughtered very
near to the farm where they were reared.''
Is the campaign just another step along the road towards their vision
of a vegetarian or even vegan society? He denied this. ''Our
organisation is not a vegetarian pressure group. Most of us are
vegetarian because the very nature of what we deal with leads people to
take that option.''

PARENTS will be able to take young children into some public houses in
England and Wales from next month, following Scotland's example.
Licensees can now apply for Children's Certificates, and licensing
officials should approve the first applications within six weeks.
Under the new rules, children under 14 must be accompanied by an adult
and must leave by 9pm. Licensees must also show they have a room with a
''family atmosphere'' where food and non-alcoholic drinks are served
before gaining a certificate.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said: ''The new arrangements are good
news for both customers and licensees. Parents will be able to enjoy a
drink in the company of their family, while children will benefit from
seeing sensible drinking in a relaxed family environment.''
Mr Tony Payne, chief executive of the Federation of Licensed
Victuallers' Associations, said that ''allowing families to take
children into pubs must be good news because it will show children
sensible drinking''.
A similar certificate system has operated for about three years in
Scotland.
About one in six Scottish pubs are thought to have been given
certificates, although licensees say the system has not been as popular
as Ministers hoped because families are forced to leave at 8pm.
''I think many licensees feel that they lose trade with a certificate
because people have to leave so early,'' said a spokesman for the UK and
Ireland Licensed Trade Association. ''Many would prefer a system which
gave the licensees more discretion about whether or not to allow
children in.''

<TEXT>
A TEENAGE boy found dead at home on Saturday -- the day before his
father killed himself -- had suffered an appalling series of injuries
inflicted over a long period, it was disclosed yesterday.
Child protection agencies in Bolton have started a review of whether
anything could have been done to help Thomas Oakes, 14, of Caledonia
Street, Deane. He was not on any ''at risk'' register.
The body of the boy's father, James, 34, was found in Wigan on Sunday
with self-inflicted knife wounds and a ligature around the neck.
Detective Superintendent Fred Robinson, of Bolton CID, said: ''The boy
suffered extensive injuries which would appear to have been inflicted
over a long period of time.''
The boy, who had a record of truancy and had not been to school since
September, is understood to have suffered a broken jaw, a broken arm and
thumb and had cigarette burns over his body, as well as cuts and
bruises.
Bolton West MP Mr Tom Sackville, a junior Health Minister, called for
an inquiry. ''Questions need to be asked about the role of the agencies
and council departments who have a statutory responsibility for child
protection and to follow up truancy,'' he said.
Thomas had attended school in Farnworth, near Bolton, and told
teachers that he and his father, who was separated, were moving to
Wigan.
A Bolton Council spokesman said checks had been made at the house
where the family were then living but it had been found empty.

Stand by for the
return of, among
others, the saucy
blonde. For the look
of '95 is an electic
harking-back to
every decade of the
century. And Retro
Fashion is the name
of the game, report
Anne Simpson and
Francesca Fearon
PARADING her Hollywood smile and animal dazzle, the saucy blonde is
back again, the icon of every designer collection. Guided by such
disparate hands as Westwood and Valentino, she is the ghost of golden
screen goddesses. But if 1995 is the year to dye for, blondeness doesn't
have it all its own way, for sultriness is also on the rise, and that
means the lady in black, from hair to heel, is also playing for
attention.
So, with the sex bomb and the femme fatale marching abreast, this will
be the year when Retro Fashion seeks to breathe vitality into the
paraphernalia of good old-fashioned film-star glamour.
Workers For Freedom dress the brunette in dramatic black organza
combined with satin which might well have been filched from Joan
Crawford's curvaceous wardrobe. Elsewhere the spirit of Lombard,
Dietrich, Harlow and Monroe acquire comely memorials even from the most
understated fashion house of Prada.
Aside from this, the looks of '95 are significantly safe and prim. The
recession may be over in the minds of economists but fashion retailing
throughout the western world remains far too sluggish for designers to
make that brave leap into the imaginatively new.
What we have, then, are tidy twin sets for the simple reason that they
are tried and trusted sellers, only this time the jumpers are often
cropped to reveal a winking navel.
The 1940s are remembered with little filleted jackets, waisted and
skirted or cropped and worn with white gloves. Again these could be
cast-offs from Joan Crawford's swank but those floral tea dresses,
anticipated for spring, have the sweetheart gentility of a wartime Vera
Lynn, a curious quality to emerge from New York's Anna Sui, normally one
of the naughtiest designers in town.
Jersey, bias cut, tailored or simply straight, is emerging as the big
fabric for 1995, a cloth of commonsense as well as comfort, and one in
total contrast to the year's other important material, satin. Sliding
into both day and evening wear, satin now totally dismantles any
distinction between lingerie and outer dress. Satin suits, satin skirts,
satin pant suits and satin trench coats give us shameless helpings of a
luxurious fabric made practical.
Yet the customer out there may have different ideas, for satin in the
morning rush hour could just appear like the scrunched-up glad-rags of a
heavy night. As it is, that may already be the fate of Yamamoto's
proposed net tunics which hang loosely over long dark robes like
shapelessly knitted dishcloths dipping into infinity.
Still on the reckless side, corsetry continues to hold daywear in its
grip. Ferre's boned beach dress is scarcely longer than the more
generous one-piece bathing costume. And Ozbek provides a new
interpretation of the bib and tucker, chopping off the design below the
bust so that the midriff stands naked above hipster leggings with the
new year's all-important thin belt.
Otherwise every decade of the century seems destined for the shop
rails during the next 12 months -- a revival which begins with
turn-of-the-century heroine frocks from Westwood and rambles through
shirtwaisters over skinny pants from the 1950s to end with Calvin
Klein's minimalist petticoat dresses and Alex McQueen's swagger coats in
fabrics printed with the ghoulish red realism of tyre track markings.
As for the colour palette, it ranges from palest shell pink through
hot orange to flame.
Generally, though, such fashion eclecticism possesses a certain
refugee quality. This is the look of a society rummaging through the
attics, unsure of its own future and how best to dress the modern woman.
Today, in fact, fashion greets the new year by dodging the present
with a frantic reworking of the past.

IT is that time of year again -- not just the season to be jolly but a
seemingly endless period of dark, freezing mornings that seek out your
Achilles heel and deliver an icy comeuppance. In these dog-days of slush
and post-Christmas penury it is the soft underbelly of your lifestyle --
to wit, sloth -- that is exposed without compassion or remorse.
The thing is that, although winter is by and large an annual event,
you -- in the company of many a local authority roads department -- have
failed to heed the fact and . . . nip, freeze, chill, before you have
time to say ''Where is the rock salt?'' or ''Who last used the
de-icer?'' you are flat on your back on the path and your car stands at
the kerb with all the instant get-up-and-go to be found in a barrel of
lard just removed from the Buttercup Cold Store.
Quite simply, you have, yet again, failed to take precautions, to
spend the few hours necessary to put your house in order having
preferred, instead, to spend time broadening your base and narrowing
your mind in the company of intellectual heavyweights from Crinkley
Bottom and Gladiators. As a result you are snowed in, iced up,
deep-frozen, irritable, and secretly ashamed. You know it need not have
happened.
You should, it goes without saying, have bought the special
summer-offer pipe lagging at your local DIY store when you were there in
July getting dried blood for your prize Ena Harkness. And it would not
have gone amiss if you had snapped a can or six of de-icer from the
petrol-station forecourt when they were first touted, back in August,
before the ''Autumn is Coming'' promotion gave way in September to the
''Santa is Here'' special offer of sun-loungers for '95.
But you did not, did you? Time enough, you said, and thus here you are
today: the WC frozen solid, the garden tap just waiting for the thaw so
that it can flood the patio, your car without the gumption to get
started -- a condition referred to in the garage trade as a knackered
battery -- even if you were able to get into it in the first place,
which you are not, because frozen locks have made it secure with a
certainty that is the envy of Michael Howard and the boss of Whitemoor
Prison, that establishment beloved by IRA men desirous of a
get-away-from-it-all break.
As the old saying goes, procrastination is the thief of a comfortable
winter home. But OK, it has happened. Too late now to cry over milk so
rigid that it won't even spill. You did not prepare for the stranglehold
of the cold and now the cold has got you firmly by the throat -- to make
no mention of other valuable parts. What is to be done?
The short -- and the long -- answer is not a lot. All the pipe lagging
has long gone from shop shelves, de-icer cans are now changing hands for
up to a fiver at car-boot sales, the world market in rock salt has been
cornered by Strathclyde Regional Council, anti-freeze for the car
radiator is as scarce as a Cabinet resignation in the face of
departmental melt-down, and owing to MOD cutbacks there is no chance of
a helicopter drop of room temperature Irn-Bru to keep your spirits up .
. . so to speak.
There is just one short-term option open as your breath fogs-in the
sitting-room and the air cracks as before an Arctic icebreaker when you
enter the smallest room in the house. Just keep your eyes open for one
of those great big Swiss dogs, overcome your revulsion at the idea of
having to drink brandy by the litre from the same cask from which it
sups, and make a simple resolution.
Next summer, even as you wield the greenfly spray you bought in
December, remember to go out and buy all the winter-proofing you can get
your hands on. Warm hands, warm nose, a flushing loo, and a working car.
In the meantime, if you have no faith in the arrival of a
brandy-drinking dog, strap on your snow shoes, shrink into your parka
collar, and set off for the nearest relatives whose iron self-discipline
and high-order organisation you despise. Throw yourself on their mercy
but don't be entirely surprised if you learn the real meaning of the old
phrase ''cold as charity''.

* Having sold them with a certain flair, Tim Waterstone is now writing
novels
with equal enthusiasm. JULIA LANGDON felt inclined to ask him: why?
But what about love from the man's point of view? The much-married Tim
Waterstone says he is well qualified to write on the subject.
COLLINS once wrote a book called The World is Full of Married Men. It
was immensely successful, although exceedingly trivial, possibly because
it amusingly identified a social problem known only too well to all
women over the age of, say, 25. In its own way it typified a category of
novels, including the more serious literary examination of the same
matter by dozens -- scores, hundreds -- of women novelists throughout
the last couple of decades. That examination continues.
''But you tell me,'' says Tim Waterstone, husband, father, bookseller
and now novelist, ''the names of any male authors who are writing today
about love from a man's point of view. There are masses of Anita
Brookners, putting the woman's point of view, but what about parental
love and failed marriages from a man's point of view?''
He is speaking with some passion. Being naturally reticent, he says,
he almost finds it difficult to say the word, the word which inspires
his writing, that which he specifically wishes to address. Almost, but
he manages.
At first sighting -- the publishing party of his first novel held on
the premises of the first Waterstone bookshop in London's Old Brompton
Road -- he looks like an unlikely romantic hero. There is a warmth,
though, in his greeting for guests like Edna O'Brien. Yes, looks can be
deceptive. You need only talk to him for half an hour to recognise that
here is a man who loves women.
A newspaper profile once unkindly referred to him as ''an
insipid-looking man with jug ears'' (which he found irritating enough to
ascribe to one of the characters in his novel) but it was the tone of
the profile he disliked, rather than the personal comments, and he would
probably not disagree with this description.
When we met and talked, although he is obviously shy and diffident, it
was only minutes before I put down my pen and he was confiding in me and
I was telling him the most personal things. I could see why he has been
married three times. Or at least I could see why women like him.
It may not be long, however, before he becomes something of a popular
cult figure for married men. The world, as we have already remarked, is
indeed full of them -- but perhaps that is because not many men care to
spend too much time alone, and consequently a great many of these
married men have been married more than once. And many of them,
according to Tim Waterstone, may also be suffering in consequence. Worry
not, however, gentle reader: we are concerned here not with Man as
Victim, but Man as Hero.
''I do find love from a man's point of view an interesting subject --
largely because I have quite a lot of experience. You may be a feminist
. . .'' (has he been bitten, perhaps, by a few others who have
interviewed him?) ''. . . but I can only see life from a man's point of
view. I am a heterosexual, middle-aged man -- that's my only viewpoint,
so you will forgive me for that -- and I do see a certain heroism in the
way men do conduct their lives.
''Men are providers still, and some do provide for a very long time --
me and millions and millions of men. But that is not a story you read in
Anita Brookner. I like women very much indeed -- which is why I keep on
marrying them -- but men are capable of great emotions as women are. Yet
society favours women as against men, particularly in cases of marital
breakdowns.''
These are deep waters, as even a casual reader would acknowledge, but
it is the crux of everything to do with Tim Waterstone: his writing, his
experience, his life. He refers often, obliquely, to his knowledge of
Life: the wives, the alimony, the children (there are eight) and how
they are all going into his books, in the contexts of attachment and
loss.
The first novel, about which he is engagingly nervous, is partly about
publishing, but in reality that it is only the setting. (He likes
publishers, but regards the subject as only supporting half a novel). It
is selling well -- justifiably so, for it is a moving story well told;
and it is already going into paperback which will appear simultaneously
with the hardback of his second next year. He had finished the draft of
the third before the first was out.
Now this is a man, Glasgow-born in 1939, apparently embarking upon his
fourth career in his fifties with three marriages, eight children, a
chain of eponymous bookshops (sold for #42 million to W H Smith at a
personal gain of about #9 million) behind him, and who thus can't
possibly want for a bob or two. So why is he doing this? And what is
going on here?
''Rich ? Nobody with eight children, two lots of alimony and income
tax is rich!'' he protests. But the simple answer is that he doesn't do
anything by halves. The complicated one is that it is an urge to
succeed, a desire to prove that he can write a book that will be bought
in the bookshops that bear his name -- and everywhere else besides --
but not just because his name is now synonymous with skilful book
marketing.
His working life started as an auctioneer in tea in India, following
the steps of his Scottish father who worked for James Finlay's Indian
tea gardens. Then he joined Allied Breweries, became marketing director
in charge of a multi-million budget, chucked that up to sell books for W
H Smith and then got fired. This sweetened the subsequent sale to the
company of Waterstones -- particularly as the man who fired him
specifically said that he didn't mind what Waterstone did as long as he
didn't open any bookshops.
That was 1982. A sympathetic bank manager, a good idea, and the rest
is well recorded -- or in his bank account. But why novels? He confesses
to being a driven man who finds writing ''intensely pleasurable''.
''The words just spill out,'' he says; it is even ''bliss''. This is
not to mock him, but to convey his fervour. He just wants to keep
writing, partly, he admits, out of fear -- but of what? Lost time,
perhaps? He does not want to stop. He tries to structure every day so
that he does not waste a moment. He has a sense of needing to deliver
''a decent body of work'' without knowing what that is: seven books
perhaps? Eight? Twelve?
He has been observing people for so long and wanting to write about
what he has seen and experienced and felt -- but has always had excuses
not to do so. Until now. The excuses have been removed and although he
truly can't have much time -- with his third wife, Rosie and two tiny
children under two, friends and interests, and several directorships,
including a seat on the London Philharmonic board -- he hugely enjoys
the process of literary creation, and conveys a great excitement about
it. Lucky him. Lucky Tim.
He was, however, careful to ensure that he was not subject to favoured
treatment, just because he was known in the industry. He rewrote on
advice, sought and found an editor who would advise him, and rejected
some potential publishers because he thought they didn't understand what
he was trying to do.
These may be luxuries not available to everybody, but, on the other
hand, they are the mark of a grown-up. Perhaps they are a reflection,
too, of the worldly experience of this much-married man who says: ''I've
got no problem at all about listening to advice.''
Perhaps it might be a good thing if he became a role model for all
those married men out there?

Violence was vital to the plot of his new movie, but audiences have
only found it funny,
Hal Hartley tells WILLIAM RUSSELL
VIOLENCE in films is smart when it involves Quentin Tarantino or
Oliver Stone, all the more so in the case of Natural Born Killers
because the former, who wrote it, has disowned the result directed by
the latter. Yet other directors can stage scenes of considerable
violence without causing the UK censor to take fright and withhold a
certificate.
Take Hal Hartley's Amateur. It deals with an amnesiac pornographer who
is pursued by three men -- a hired killer and an accountant for the Mob,
sent by the gang boss he has cheated, and a former business colleague.
The hit man tortures the colleague with electric shocks, rendering him
insane, in an attempt to find out where the pornographer is hiding. In
the bloody denouement there is a long sequence in which the madman tries
to shoot one of his torturers and succeeds in killing him only after a
long, painful chase.
So why are we not cringing at the result? Possibly because Hartley is
an independent film-maker whose film, while it may be widely seen, will
be shown mainly to art house audiences who do not, apparently, require
moral protection. But also because the violence is not mere plot
embroidery but an essential part of the lifestyle of an evil man who
deals in the baser human fantasies.
The inspiration for Amateur came while Hartley was in Europe two years
ago publicising Simple Men, his previous film shown on television
recently.
''I had this image of a man waking up in the street, not knowing who
he was, where he had come from,'' he says. The result is a fascinating
look at the nature of good and evil, at what people are really like,
because the no-memory man who in the present is decent and honourable
has an evil past.
''Up until that point I had not spent much time out of America, and it
felt quite nice to be so far away from anyone I knew,'' says Hartley.
''I felt anonymous, but at the same time I felt lonely. I was in a good
state of mind. It was fertile ground.''
From that feeling of isolation the film's hero, Martin -- played by a
Hartley regular, Martin Donovan -- was born.
But his past catches up with him in the shape of the two hit men and,
unusually for Hartley, some very graphic violence ensues and the film
ends in an inevitable death.
Hartley says he does not like violence, and is certainly no advocate
of torture, but he was interested in showing cruelty on screen. ''I
don't think I succeeded,'' he admits. ''I just cannot make scenes that
are excruciating, and yet I wanted to be excruciating and graphic.
''When I was editing the murder I wondered what the audience would do
when they saw the accountant being shot by the man he had helped
torture. My considered guess was they would begin laughing at it, but
the laughter would peter out as they appreciated the futility of revenge
and the scene would then become pathetic. I have now seen the film four
or five times with audiences in different countries and they all laughed
uproariously from beginning to end.''
He says the film is about deprivation, lack of knowledge. Martin, a
pornographer, does not know about his past, and all that Isobel Huppert
(who finds him lying in the street) knows is that he is kind and gentle.
Other people, including Martin's mistress, Sofia, whom he has exploited,
abused and turned into a porn star, knows the other, horrible side.
Amateur is his most commercial film so far, with its classic mystery
plot. Martin is pushed out of the window by his exploited mistress,
Sofia (Elina Lowensohn, also in Simple Men), who then makes the mistake
of trying to capitalise on what she knows about his business deals,
falling foul of the hitmen pursuing him for reneging on a deal. The
torture scene and the killings stem from that situation.
Hartley has, however, no intention of abandoning his career as an
independent film maker. ''In my opinion interesting work is not being
done in Los Angeles in the studios,'' he says. ''Basically, expensive
star-identified movies are not interesting movies -- they tend to be
director-identified, like those of Jim Jarmusch.''
Would he like to work with a star? He suggests Susan Sarandon, who has
starred in a lot of star identified Hollywood films. ''I think she has a
lot more interesting things to do with her career than that,'' he adds.
''I go to see the boring films she is in because I like to see her work.
It is the work is important to me. Stars and money come after that.
''If offered a project with a star, I would weigh that star against
what it cost me to make the film, and if the cost was too high, I
wouldn't do it.''
As to how Huppert, a European star, came to be in the film, he
explains that his films are popular in France, and that she wrote saying
she would like to work with him.
''I think she wanted to make more English-language films, but
director-identified movies like those she had made with Chabrol, and I
was an obvious first step,'' he says.
She was probably also attracted by the role of the ex-nun trying to
make a career out of writing pornography -- who claims to be a
nymphomaniac although still a virgin, and falls in love with this
stranger.
Hartley is usually classified as having a European approach to
film-making, which is though to be rare in an American. He says he
doesn't know why.
''Maybe it's because I do a lot of rehearsal, but I think the real
thing that is European about my films is my choice of lenses,'' he
explains. ''Arguably the two most important film makers for me are
Bresson and Goddard who always used 15mm lenses, rarely went wide. I
also shoot in the standard European frame, whereas the American frame is
thinner and longer.''
A pragmatic chap, Mr Hartley. It would have been easy to have given a
cahier du cinema type reply, instead he modestly turned technical.

THE 100-year-old herring station pier in Lerwick is to be demolished
and rebuilt. The #133,000 development is being undertaken by Lerwick
Boating Club, which owns the pier and uses it to store equipment.
Shetland Enterprise is backing the project with a #5000 grant. Further
financial assistance is coming from Shetland Islands Council, Lerwick
Harbour Trust and Lerwick Community Council, while local businesses are
also sponsoring the undertaking.
The Lerwick Boat Club, with 250 members, was founded in 1881 and,
while some members own yachts and dinghies, the majority still use the
traditional Shetland model class open sailing boat. The club also helps
organise a number of international competitions in and around Shetland
waters.
Mr Stephen Johnstone, secretary of the boat club, said: ''The pier was
originally built as part of a herring station at the end of last
century, but a survey by the Harbour Trust has revealed it is in very
poor condition.''
Contractors have started demolition work and the club hopes the new
facility, which will be slightly larger than the original, will be
completed by April in time for the new sailing season.
Shetland Enterprise chief executive Mr Bill Fraser said: ''The new
pier will greatly improve facilities for club members and visiting crews
and help safeguard the future of Lerwick Boating Club. The project is a
good demonstration of public bodies pooling their financial resources.''
Meanwhile in Skye, a joint venture between Highland Regional Council
and Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise seems likely to produce a major
redevelopment of Elgol harbour. The LEC has approved a #42,500 grant,
while the council has committed #77,500 to the project, and will now
seek a further #120,000 from the European Objective One aid.
The jetty and harbour at Elgol are used daily by a dozen local fishing
boats which last year landed around #500,000 worth of fish and
shellfish. In addition, large numbers of tourists are attracted to the
harbour by the spectacular views across Loch Scavaig to Loch Coruisk.
The harbour also provides a lifeline to the six families living on the
island of Soay, and a welcome berth for many visiting yachts in the
summer.

THE hunt for Christmas Day murder suspect Phillip Manning focused on
London last night after police found his abandoned car.
Mr Manning, 41, described as ''dangerous and unstable'', is wanted in
connection with the shotgun murder of his ex-wife Margaret Whitcombe,
42, who was killed in front of their 11-year-old son Daniel at home in
Abertillery, Gwent, Wales.
It was disclosed yesterday that Metropolitan police spotted Mr
Manning's silver grey A-Reg Ford Sierra in a side street in West
Kensington on Saturday.
Officers mounted a secret 48-hour surveillance operation in Gliddon
Road, but Mr Manning did not return to collect the car.
The vehicle was parked only 15 minutes' walk from the kiosk where Mr
Manning phoned his mother, Mrs Sally Edwards, 61, just before noon on
Christmas Day, a few hours after the killing.
Detective Superintendent Ian Johnston of Gwent CID, liaising with
Scotland Yard, appealed for information from owners of guesthouses, pubs
and shops who may have seen Mr Manning.
''Finding the car is a significant breakthrough in our inquiries. We
believe he could still be in the West London area,'' a police spokesman
said.
Mrs Whitcombe's boyfriend, Neil Jones, 42, lost part of his skull when
he was knifed in the same attack.
He is being protected under a 24-hour police guard while he recovers
at an undisclosed hospital.

<RECORDNO>980533437</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FERRIES must be modified so that they stay upright for 30 minutes in
the event of water getting on board, a report from an influential
engineering group will recommend this week.
It is essential that passengers on roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) ferries
be given a good chance of survival in the event of an accident, the
Cabinet Office-sponsored Royal Academy of Engineering will say.
Its report will go to a number of interested parties, including the
Department of Transport, and will put pressure on shipping authorities
to speed up ferry safety legislation.
Consisting of about 1000 distinguished UK engineers, the academy aims
to promote excellence in engineering.
After the Estonia ferry disaster last September, in which more than
900 lives were lost, the academy set up a working party to produce a
report on ferry safety.
''The 30-minute stability recommendation is one of the key points of
the report,'' an academy spokesman said.
''Obviously, there will have to be different solutions for different
ships. But other modes of transport, such as aircraft, have set
evacuation times laid down and ro-ro ferries should be no exception.''
A spokesman for ferry company Stena Sealink said: ''The academy's idea
is fine in principle but the shipping industry requires legislation from
the International Maritime Organisation.''
After the Estonia tragedy, the UK's Marine Safety Agency stepped up
random checks on ships using British ports and later announced that one
third of these vessels had door problems, although only one ship had to
be detained in port.
However, the Consumers' Association yesterday accused ferry operators
of hiding behind the skirts of the IMO.
''There is absolutely no reason why ferry companies should not act now
to make their ships as safe as possible,'' said Mr Derek Prentice,
assistant director at Consumers' Association.
Meanwhile, 100 unseaworthy foreign ships have been detained at UK
ports in the last six months, the Government said yesterday.
The figure represents 8% of the 1140 ships inspected and was described
as ''stark and disturbing'' by Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney.
In one of the worst cases found by inspectors, the crew of a ship had
to fill holes in the ship's side, tanks and interior bulkhead with
wooden plugs.
In another case on a fish factory ship, rat infestation was so bad the
crew was unable to sleep.
''Ship owners, operators and all those responsible for the safety of
ships must learn quickly that we are not going to tolerate unsafe
vessels in our waters,'' said Dr Mawhinney.
He continued: ''We will not put up with ships which risk the lives of
their crews and our rescue services and threaten our shores with
pollution.''
Dr Mawhinney said he was particularly concerned about fish factory
ships.

POLICE were yesterday questioning a 31-year-old man about injuries
sustained by a woman in Wick in the early hours of Monday morning.
The woman was taken to hospital for emergency treatment after
receiving serious head injuries during the incident in the Pultneytown
area of the town.
A Northern Constabulary spokesman yesterday said that a man had been
taken into custody in connection with the inquiry, which led to a
manhunt in the area. Murchison Street, where the attack is thought to
have occurred, was cordoned off for several hours.
Police, who have not named the woman involved also made a fresh appeal
for help from the public.
A spokesman said: ''We would still like to hear from anyone who has
information on this incident.'' Detectives had searched an area of waste
ground off Oldwick Road in Wick. Residents in the area said there had
been concern about a prowler.

THE new English-born chief of Scotland's coal mines yesterday
predicted a glowing future for the industry.
Mr David Brewer, 48, who took over yesterday as finance and operations
director after the sale of British Coal's assets north of the Border
last week to the consortium Mining Scotland Ltd, said Scotland was the
jewel in the crown of the UK industry.
The #45m deal involved the deep mine at Longannet in Fife and nine
open-cast sites around Scotland with a workforce of more than 1000. The
new owners, a partnership between public companies and unions, will
trade as the Scottish Coal Co. Ltd.
Mr Brewer said: ''The English business might be bigger, but the
Scottish mining industry offers far better prospects. There are large
reserves of good-quality coal in Scotland and the long-term market looks
excellent. There is a glowing future for Scottish Coal.
''Scottish coal is low in sulphur and can be mined at low cost. It is
therefore cheap and environmentally-friendly.''
Mr Brewer, who was born in Lincolnshire, has spent all his working
life in the coal industry and was previously head of finance at British
Coal. He had earlier been involved in making an unsuccessful management
bid to buy the coalfields in the three English regions in the
Government's privatisation packages.
Mr Brewer said: ''I don't regard the opportunity I was offered in
Scotland as second- best in any way.''
He said they would soon be investing in the future of Longannet to
extend the reserves so that the mine could continue working well into
the next century. ''The investment cost will be #10m to #15m. That will
secure the future of deep mine employment in Scotland,'' he said.
''This will probably take us to the year 2020. There are something
like 20 million tonnes of reserves in the area.''
Mr Brewer was more reticent on the future of the closed Frances
colliery which is been maintained by British Coal.
Mr Brewer said: ''We have made an offer to the Government and that has
not been accepted. Frances represents a substantial area of reserves but
the development cost is likely to be high. It will need careful
consideration.''
He said there would be a feasability study in the near future on
Frances, which costs #1.7m a year to keep open.
Company director Campbell Christie, the STUC general secretary, said
he would be arguing very strongly that the company should pursue the
development of Frances colliery. ''It is an important part of our
thinking: that's why the bid was made and we are still in
negotiations.''
* Miners at a South Wales pit yesterday cut the first coal since
buying the colliery. The 239 men are confident they can hit a target of
around 9000 tonnes a week at Tower colliery, at Hirwaun, Mid Glamorgan,
which British Coal claimed had no future.
It was mothballed last April in the run up to coal privatisation, but
the miners refused to accept closure and launched a #2m fund by each
raising #8000 for a successful bid, the first all-employee buy-out of a
British pit.

<HEADLINE>Rosemary West will go to court, says detective</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980533440</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE prosecution of the wife of alleged mass murderer Fred West is
expected to go ahead as planned next month, the detective heading the
Cromwell Street inquiry said last night.
Detective Superintendent John Bennett's remarks came as the Crown
Prosecution Service announced it was considering the implication of
West's death on the case against his wife, Rosemary.
She was jointly accused with her husband of the murders of nine young
women whose remains were uncovered in a police search of their house and
garden at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester.
Mr Leo Goatley, the solicitor representing Mrs West, 41, has
maintained that the Crown case against her has become ''more flimsy'' on
the death of her husband.
At a Gloucester news conference, Det. Supt Bennett admitted that the
death of builder West, 53, in his cell at Birmingham's Winson Green
prison, had ''complicated'' the inquiry.
However, he said he believed committal proceedings against Mrs West
would still go ahead as scheduled in Dursley, Gloucestershire, on
February 6.
The CPS, announcing its review, said lawyers and leading counsel in
the case would meet as soon as practicable, although no conclusion was
likely to be reached in the immediate future.
There has been intense speculation about whether the case against Mrs
West could go ahead since her husband's apparent suicide on New Year's
Day.
A post-mortem examination yesterday confirmed that West -- who was
charged with murdering 12 women and girls, including his first wife and
two of his daughters -- died from ''cerebral anoxia due to hanging'',
police said.
If the committal proceedings go ahead, they are likely to last at
least a week and are certain to attract national and international
publicity.
Mr Goatley's legal team are expected to move ''no case to answer'' at
the scheduled old-style committal proceedings at Dursley courthouse
before the Metropolitan Chief Stipendiary Peter Badge.
Mrs West is scheduled to make a formal brief remand appearance before
Gloucester City Magistrates next Tuesday.
Gloucester's Conservative MP Douglas French commented: ''If the case
against Mrs West does not go ahead, there will be a legitimate public
outcry.''
He said did not believe press coverage of West's death jeopardised her
chances of getting a fair trial.
Mr French added: ''I don't think the extra interest since Fred West's
death will cause the potential jury to think any differently about the
case against Mrs West than they would have done previously.''
At last night's news conference, Det. Supt Bennett condemned newspaper
reports that the Cromwell Street inquiry could involve as many as 60
bodies as ''inaccurate, without foundation and speculative''.
Det, Supt Bennett, who for 10 months has headed the county's biggest
murder inquiry, said there were no plans to carry out digging searches
anywhere in the country and no further search warrants had been sought.

A RECORD 61 prisoners committed suicide in British jails last year, a
rise of nearly one third on 1993, according to figures released today.
The total, disclosed by the Howard League for Penal Reform, compares
with 47 prison suicides in 1993 and eclipses the previous 1990 record
when 50 inmates took their own lives.
The figures show that seven ''lifers'' and three remand prisoners
facing possible life sentences committed suicide in 1994.
Of the dead, 25 were aged 25 or under, 26 were on remand and one was a
woman.
Precise statistics for the means of self-inflicted death were
unavailable, but hanging was the most common method.
Other methods included cutting throats, the use of ligatures, and
drugs.

AN MP has claimed that ScottishPower and Northern Ireland Electricity
may be acting illegally in their contract for an interconnector.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, has
alerted the industry watchdog and is demanding an investigation by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The companies want to build an interconnector supported by over 40
miles of pylons across south Ayrshire and an undersea cable to Northern
Ireland.
Its backers say the project will substantially boost the economies of
both countries, but objectors feel that it will have an unacceptable
effect on the environment.
A public inquiry into the application will resume later this month.
Meanwhile, however, Mr Foulkes will continue his campaign on the
legality or otherwise of the proposed contract. He said: ''If this is
found to be in breach of the current legislation, I feel sure it will
scupper this controversial and unwelcome project.''
Mr Foulkes has written to the director-general of electricity supply,
Professor Stephen Littlechild expressing his concerns.
The MP claims that not only will the interconnector act as a direct
disincentive to indigenous generation in Northern Ireland, but also that
electricity prices will rise in the Province.
He claims that the agreement may breach various sections of the
Electricity Act, and that it will create an unacceptable monopoly of
electricity supply.
Mr Foulkes said last night: ''I think once again we are seeing the
arrogance of ScottishPower and NIE in believing that they can just push
through this deal without recourse or reference to the existing
legislation.
''It is intolerable that, in every other area of the United Kingdom,
electricity companies and their customers have a choice of the best
supplier of electricity.
''I make no bones about the fact that I am putting this forward
because neither I nor the majority of my constituents want this
interconnector to be built. At the same time, though, I think it raises
serious questions about the power of the legislation and the conduct of
these companies.''
A ScottishPower spokesman said: ''ScottishPower and Northern Ireland
Electricity are aware of their obligations under the Electricity Act and
Electricity Orders. We are confident that when the director-general is
made aware of the facts he will support our position.''

<TEXT>
THE media thirst for information on the life of Fred West reached new
heights yesterday with reports that a former legal clerk was offering
the mass murder suspect's ''confession'' for sale for a reputed
six-figure sum.
It is understood that several national newspapers were approached by
an intermediary on behalf of the unidentified Gloucester-based man who
is believed to have been close to the case.
The offer is thought to involve claims that details would be given of
how builder West allegedly killed his victims and his motive for the
murders.
Detective Superintendent John Bennett, who heads the Cromwell Street
inquiry, last night said he had no knowledge of such a sale offer.
If information was forthcoming, it would be investigated, he said.
West's death on New Year's Day means he will never answer the 12
murder charges he was facing.
Mr Leo Goatley, the solicitor representing his widow, Rosemary, has
claimed that West confessed to the Cromwell Street killings in police
interviews and maintained that his wife was not involved.
Mrs West is accused of nine murders.
Senior Tories yesterday reacted with outrage to the report of the sale
offer.
Mr Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, and chairman of the Conservative
backbench media committee, said: ''If this story is correct, it's
absolutely outrageous.
''It would be a total breach of professional confidence, and it would
call into question the probity of the legal profession, as well as the
press.
''I would have thought the Press Complaints Commission, if it has any
value whatever, which I have always doubted, would wish to make a view
known that no newspaper should pay for that.''

DEFENCE chiefs have wasted more than #5000m of taxpayers' money,
Labour claimed yesterday.
Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark said #2300m had been squandered
over defence procurement problems, #800m had been wasted on the Trident
works programme, and #400m was lost through six Tornado crashes.
Details of the alleged waste emerged in a report by Dr Clark as 18,700
jobs are being cut in a bid to save #750m a year from 1996-97.
He said defence equipment costs were soaring.
Dr Clark said the waste was a national disgrace.
The Defence Costs Study review, published last July, unveiled a series
of swingeing cuts across the defence sector.
Dr Clark insisted none of these would have been necessary if the
defence budget was properly managed.
The list of waste includes:
* Army withdrawal from Germany, #177m.
* Procurement problems, #2300m.
* Trident works programme, #800m.
* Trident tactical weapons system, #312m.
* Poor equipment reliability and maintainability, #500m.
* Tornado crashes, #400m.

From WILLIAM RUSSELL
in Dhaka
THE capital may have been strikebound and the Government embattled,
but it was business as usual yesterday for the Foreign Secretary, Mr
Douglas Hurd. He is making his first visit to Bangladesh, the first by a
British Foreign Secretary for nearly a quarter of a century, to look at
the British aid programme.
Bangladesh received #55m last year, the second largest recipient of
British aid. Most is focused on small projects aimed at improving
health, farming methods, family planning, women's role in society, and
the development of the infrastructure essential if foreign investment is
to be attracted.
Aid is today's agenda. Yesterday there was a dinner given by Mr Hurd's
counterpart, Mr Mostafizur Rahman, as well as discreet talks with Mr S A
M S Kibria, political adviser to Sheikha Hasina, the Opposition leader
and the other woman of Bangladeshi politics. Mr Hurd will visit the
leading lady, Prime Minister Khalida Zia, tonight before leaving for
India tomorrow.
The three Opposition parties -- Sheikha Hasina heads the largest, the
Awami League -- resigned en masse from Parliament last week in protest
at alleged electoral corruption. They launched a programme of national
strikes on Monday, the third and last of which yesterday paralysed the
capital.
The Opposition parties want the Prime Minister to resign, instal a
neutral government, and allow fresh General Elections to be held. She
has offered to meet their demand by resigning a month before her
five-year term is up next year, handing power to the President to
supervise the elections.
At the moment the crisis has reached a stalemate and the political
in-fighting has begun to annoy the people as the strikes lose them
money. As a result Mr Hurd seems to come as a negotiator and the first
question put to him on his arrival was, what was he going to do.
In a masterly display of diplomatic sidestepping, he replied: ''It is
important political uncertainty should be removed but it is for you to
say how.''
When Mr Hurd met Finance Minister Saifur Rahman, they signed two new
aid agreements worth more than #33m to be spent on a gas development
project and on rebuilding some 50 bridges in the north-east of the
country.
Mr Hurd emphasised that Britain wanted to play its part in the
development of Bangladesh and said the potential for trade had not yet
been tapped.
Mr Hurd pinpointed the country's problem, once summed up by Henry
Kissinger as being a basket case. ''The trouble is good news travels
very slowly,'' said Mr Hurd. ''There is a time lag before people realise
what Bangladesh is achieving.''
Mr Rahman said the economic situation and all indicators were good. By
the end of the century he hoped the country would be self-reliant in
food, with 40% of development costs already financed internally.
If Mr Hurd's visit achieves anything it is to dispel the belief that
this is a backward country. It may be very poor, but Dhaka is no
flyblown mud-drenched backwater, rather a bustling metropolis.
The Junior Trade and Industry Minister, Mr Tony Baldry, led a trade
delegation here last month and the 22 companies represented were amazed.
They did #1.5m of business in two days, and the High Commission says
this is only the beginning. Should anyone wonder what Bangladesh has to
do with Britain, apart from its potential as a market, there are from
300,000 to 500,000 Bangladeshis living in the UK.
In his talks with the Foreign Minister Mr Hurd also raised the case of
the writer Taslima Nasrin, who fled to Sweden last year to avoid
blasphemy charges. She is said to have demanded a revision of the Koran
to give women more powers in a male-dominated society and has upset some
religious extremists. However, while Bangladesh is officially a Muslim
country, people are at pains to insist it is not fundamentalist and that
other religions are tolerated.
* A cold wave sweeping South Asia has killed at least 40 people in
northern Bangladesh, which recorded its coldest winter in 30 years. Many
poor children and homeless old people were among the dead, since a
temperature of even 4C (39F) is low enough to kill Bangladeshis who
cannot afford winter clothes. A shepherd and his flock of 70 sheep also
perished in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir where three lakes were
frozen in -9C (16F) temperature.

MUSLIM fundamentalists are threatening to kill British citizens ''in
cold blood'' unless the Government closes the embassy in Algeria.
The threat is believed to have been made by the same group responsible
for the hijacking and murder of hostages on an Air France jet at
Christmas.
The Armed Islamic Group, at the heart of a bloody struggle against the
Algerian Government, set this Saturday as the deadline to evacuate the
embassy.
The Foreign Office said yesterday that the letter, written in German,
had been received at the British embassy in Berne.
The letter, sent to several Western governments with interests in
Algeria, warned: ''All contact with our country should be broken by
January 7 and the embassy should be cleared.
''We cannot guarantee the lives of foreign nationals after the expiry
of this ultimatum. After that all unbelievers will be killed in cold
blood.''
The violent Islamic uprising in Algeria has already seen at least 76
foreigners murdered.
Last week, after the hijacking, the latest victims were four Roman
Catholic priests, three French and a Belgian.
The Foreign Office said the staffing of the embassy in Algiers was
kept under constant review.
Ambassador Christopher Crabbie now heads a team of four, which was cut
from six last month in advance of the Air France hijacking. They are
protected by a team of military police and already take careful
precautions in their daily lives.
The exact number of Britons living in Algeria is unknown, but believed
to be around 130.
The numbers have dropped since the Foreign Office started advising
British citizens not to visit the country at the beginning of last year
and called on people already there to leave.
Most of those remaining are thought to be married to Algerians or
employed by the oil industry in the interior of the country, where they
come and go from closely guarded compounds by direct flights avoiding
national airports.
Overall the number of foreigners in Algeria has dropped sharply since
the GIA, considered the most radical Algerian rebel group, ordered
foreigners 15 months ago to leave or face death.--Reuter/PA.

Cairo, Tuesday
ISRAELIS and Palestinians went into crisis talks in Cairo today to try
to advance their stalled peace accord, marred by distrust over the
killing of three Palestinian soldiers and Israel's stance on Jewish
settlements.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres called yesterday's killings by
Israeli troops ''an unfortunate incident'' and urged that the talks
resume. However, PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath insisted that other
obstacles -- especially expansion of Jewish settlements -- must also be
resolved.
In Gaza, angry Palestinians demonstrated at the funeral of the three
policemen, many shouting slogans such as ''Death to Israel and America''
and ''Muslims will not be humiliated''.
In another development, Palestinian police arrested 12 Israelis in the
Gaza Strip today and said they were members of the Israeli secret
police.
Israel and the PLO had different versions of the shooting in Beit
Hanoun in the Gaza Strip. Israel said its soldiers were shot at from a
Palestinian police station, while the PLO argued its police fired no
shots. No Israelis were wounded in the incident.
Shaath and Peres, chairmen of a committee designed to meet when
regular peace talks ran into trouble, said the two sides agreed to
investigate yesterday's killings.
However efforts to revive the talks faced other difficulties: Israel's
hesitation about redeploying its troops in the West Bank, and the
confrontations between Palestinians and settlers who want to enlarge the
Jewish enclave of Efrat in the West Bank.
The main Cairo negotiations are aimed at arranging withdrawal of
Israel's troops from West Bank towns to expand Palestinian authority.
Such a step was called for in May's Israel-PLO pact that created the
Gaza Strip and Jericho as autonomous Palestinian zones.
PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat said the two sides were far apart on
several important issues, adding: ''The Israelis should realise if they
don't change their policies, there will be nothing to sign.''
Shaath also described ''a sense of crisis'' over the killings, the
settlement issue, and Israel's continued jailing of thousands of
Palestinian prisoners.
However he added: ''We have not reached the decision that it is
impossible. We have not said the peace process has to be abandoned.''
Shaath and Peres began their talks after both men held discussions
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa. Peres also met President
Hosni Mubarak, who has been mediating between the two sides.--AP/Reuter.

Indianapolis, Tuesday
FORMER US vice president Dan Quayle has been admitted to hospital
suffering from appendicitis and is expected to undergo surgery this
week.
Quayle, 47, entered Indiana University Medical Centre yesterday. His
spokeswoman Ann Hathaway said his treatment would probably take seven
days.
Quayle, who is expected to announce his bid for the 1996 Republican
presidential nomination soon, had treatment at the same hospital earlier
this month for blood clots in his lungs.
Hathaway said he had an enlarged appendix, which was discovered during
a check-up. She quoted him as saying that he ''just wants the thing out
. . . I don't need it anyway.''

A BUSINESSMAN who set up a sophisticated do-it-yourself cannabis
factory to escape the ''seedy'' drugs scene was sentenced to community
service yesterday.
Cassian Irvine, who runs a recording studio, spent months nurturing
the illegal nursery under carefully controlled conditions in his cellar.
Specialist lighting helped produce a thriving jungle of the banned
plants -- some were 6ft tall and worth up to #1000 each -- which he
claimed were all for personal use.
Southwark Crown Court was told that detectives discovered the illicit
operation after stopping his car in London last May and realising the
vehicle reeked of the drug.
He had #50-worth hidden in a container while passenger Justin Room had
a much larger cache, valued at more than #1000.
Officers then searched Irvine's home in Wathen Road, Leamington Spa,
Warwickshire, and found 56 high-quality cannabis plants known as Skunk.
Irvine, 24, admitted one offence of cultivation and another of
possession. Unemployed Room, 23, from Rosemary Avenue, Runcorn,
Cheshire, who said he bought his cannabis in India, pleaded guilty to
possession with intent to supply.
Judge Eugene Cotran told Irvine that while he did not believe he was
going to smoke all the cannabis he had grown himself, he accepted that
he set up the operation so that he would not have to get involved in the
''seedy drugs scene''.
Sentencing both men to 120 hours' community service, the judge added
they deserved prison, but were being given another chance.

TRIBUTES flowed yesterday for Oscar Wilde -- which would have
delighted the wit who claimed the only thing worse than being talked
about was not being talked about.
Leading the plaudits was veteran actor Sir John Gielgud, who unveiled
a Westminster City Council and Oscar Wilde Society green plaque in his
honour and said the Irish author -- who died in 1900 aged 46 -- was one
of his favourite playwrights.
''He was a brilliant, witty man,'' said Sir John, 90, who appeared
many times in Wilde's masterpiece The Importance Of Being Earnest.
''Not only was he a splendid author he was a marvellous talker --
unfortunately we haven't got him on record but they say he was the tops,
one of the best narrators who ever lived.''
Sir John doffed his hat despite the bitter cold, as a mark of respect,
when he performed the ceremony outside London's Theatre Royal,
Haymarket.
It was at this venue, exactly 100 years ago yesterday, that Wilde's
play An Ideal Husband made its debut.
More tributes are to follow, including his commemoration at Poets'
Corner in Westminster Abbey on February 14.
However, 1895 was a year of lows as well as highs for the Dublin-born
writer -- April also marks the centenary of his arrest. He scandalised
Victorian society over his love affair with Lord Alfred ''Bosie''
Douglas and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Reading for
gross indecency.
However, the feud between Bosie's father -- the Marquess of
Queensberry -- and Wilde's family is now long buried, for the present
marquess and Wilde's grandson, Merlin Holland, both attended yesterday's
ceremony.
Mr Holland, whose family changed its name after the notorious court
case, said: ''It's a great day. This year will see a lot of celebrations
but it's nice that the first celebrates his literary achievements.''
Also there was actor Donald Sinden, who played Wilde in a one-man
show.
''I'd love to play him again, I became him. This recognition is long
overdue,'' he said.
''Wilde is known for his many witty sayings. Two of my favourites are
reputed to have been said by him on his deathbed. One theory was that
the wallpaper in his hotel room in Paris was awful and he said 'one of
us will have to go'.
''The other is that he called for champagne and said 'I'm dying as I
lived -- beyond my means'.''

<TEXT>
A TEENAGE British computer hacker has caused a security headache for
the US defence department after allegedly unearthing military secrets.
The 16-year-old is thought to have breached some of the US
Government's most sensitive computers for at least seven months without
detection, according to a newspaper report yesterday.
The north London youth is alleged to have watched secret
communications between US agents in North Korea during a tense row over
nuclear inspections.
It is also claimed he obtained details of weapons research, aircraft
design, personnel records and electronic mail. After reading them, he
put them on a bulletin board on Internet, the worldwide computer
network.
Scotland Yard confirmed the boy had been arrested in July and a report
sent to the Crown Prosecution Office. Detectives expect to be told
whether he can be charged this month, the newspaper reports.
US officials regard the breach of computer security, during late 1993
and the early months of 1994, as the most serious in recent years. They
estimate more than a million user passwords were compromised and
admitted his hacking had affected ''military readiness''.
The boy, now 17, was first detected in March 1994 by the defence
department's Office of Special Investigations. He was finally caught
after leaving his terminal hooked up to a US defence computer overnight.

<TEXT>
COMPANIES who test employees for drug and alcohol abuse have been
advised to concentrate more on the latter as the effects of drugs on
work performance appears minimal.
Dr Andrew Guppy, from Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher
Education, told the conference that about 18% of UK companies tested for
abuse and that more than 90% identified alcohol as by far the bigger
problem.
The main drug identified was cannabis, mainly because it remained
traceable for up to 30 days after use, far longer than other drugs. Yet
there was little evidence to indicate that its use impaired performance.
There was no overwhelming support for drug use being a problem in
terms of workplace safety, although there might be stronger support for
a relationship between drug use and productivity.
However, alcohol abuse clearly did have an effect on performance and
heavy drinkers tended to have nearly twice the average level of days off
sick.
Companies testing employees tended to be UK companies in the transport
sector -- some of whom conducted random breath-testing -- or
subsidiaries of US parent companies.

ADVENTURE-based management training schemes could prove
counter-productive, with many participants suffering negative
side-effects, the conference was told.
Mr Adrian Ibbetson, of the University of Birmingham, and Dr Sue
Newall, of Warwick Business School, said that such schemes were unlikely
to lead to the positive group development experience expected.
The competitive element tended to have a negative side-effect which
more than offset the benefits of increasing motivation.
Members of a team who ''win'' might feel their egos had been enhanced
and their abilities vindicated but many ''losers'' felt they had failed
and their sense of failure was likely to affect their future
performance.
The findings were based on 157 Birmingham University students who
attended a three-week course in the Lake District involving physical
challenges, including building a raft to cross Conniston Water.
About 40 UK companies currently provide ''adventure-based experimental
learning techniques''.

<TEXT>
TV's gloomiest star, Richard Wilson, and his comedy show One Foot In
The Grave helped make it a Merry Christmas for BBC1.
His grumpy character Victor Meldrew topped the Christmas Day viewing
figures as BBC1 staged a repeat of 1993, with the day's three most
popular programmes, acording to independent figures.
In second place was Kevin Costner's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves;
followed by a special edition of EastEnders.
Coronation Street was below par, however, with just under 12.4 million
watching its Christmas Day special, and BBC1 had seven of Christmas
Day's top 10 programmes.
The irascible Mr Meldrew proved more appealing than the opposition
offered by Heartbeat's bobby on a rural beat, the former EastEnder Nick
Berry.
More than 15 million viewers tuned into Wilson's show on Christmas
night while Heartbeat had just under 13.8 million for ITV, four million
fewer than usual, according to figures from the Broadcasters' Audience
Research Board (Barb) for the week ending December 25.
Costner's Robin Hood had 14.32 million viewers, while 14.23 million
switched on for the latest events in Albert Square.
Rival attractions on ITV and BBC1 tended to split audiences. Wilson's
programme had an audience of nearly 4.5 million fewer than last year's
ratings leader, Only Fools And Horses. That managed 19.5 million
viewers, but David Jason's Del Boy had scarcely any opposition.
Wilson also proved a star addition to the BBC1 Christmas schedules in
1993 when his show was the most watched programme during the Christmas
period: with 20 million viewers on Boxing Day.
Other strong BBC1 Christmas Day performers this year were Victoria
Wood, with almost 13.4 million fans, and Keeping Up Appearances with
just under 13.7 million.
ITV's Disney film, Sleeping Beauty, had eight million viewers.
Viewers tuned in for an average of five hours and 22 minutes on
Christmas Day, 15 minutes less than in 1993.
The BBC's overall audience share was 57%, with the commercial channels
accounting for 38% and satellite and cable 5%.
BBC1 also had the highest rated programme on Christmas Eve, with more
than 15.2 million for hospital series Casualty.
''British viewers are still watching more television at Christmas than
at any other period of the year,'' said BBC Network Television's
managing director, Mr Will Wyatt.
* Loyal viewers continued to tune into the Queen's traditional
Christmas Day speech -- the simultaneous BBC1/ITV broadcast attracted an
audience of 14.6 million, 11.5 million of them on BBC1.

POTENTIAL transplant donors are being urged to join a new NHS computer
register in a #250,000 radio advertising campaign which will begin in
the spring.
Already 150,000 people have pledged their organs since the register
was set up in October, but junior Health Minister Tom Sackville said
yesterday that more were needed.
The register is a computer database at the UK transplant co-ordinating
centre in Bristol, alongside the database of potential recipients.
''Nearly 6000 patients are waiting for an organ to save or transform
their lives,'' Mr Sackville said. ''The donor register has got off to a
good start, but I am determined to maintain the momentum with this
campaign.''
A Freephone line -- 0800 555 777 -- has been set up for application
forms.

THE WINTRY weather, which gatecrashed many parts of Britain during the
new year celebrations, is about to be shown the door.
Forecasters say a warmer weather front moving in from the Atlantic
will signal a change to milder conditions.
Much of the UK remained just above freezing yesterday, after a bitter
night -- when temperatures again fell well below freezing. The lowest
recorded was in Aboyne, Grampian, where the thermometer plunged to
-13.9C on Monday night.
Most snow was still lying in the Aberdeen area, which had a covering
of nearly five inches, with more on surrounding hills. A Grampian Police
spokeswoman said last night that all the main roads in the region were
now passable, with care.
However, winds gusting at up to 75mph kept many skiers from the slopes
yesterday. A Cairngorm Chairlift Company spokeswoman said access roads
were closed because of drifting snow. ''There will be no skiing today,
because of high winds. It's pretty severe,'' she said.
''It's desperately disappointing. A lot of skiers have been hanging on
in the hope of grabbing some skiing before they head home after the
festive break. It doesn't look too good for tomorrow either.''
At Nevis Range near Fort William, ski-ing was limited to the lower
slopes because of gale-force winds.
In West Yorkshire, a taxi driver died after his cab skidded on black
ice, and plunged into a river alongside the A65 Leeds to Skipton road at
a notorious bend at Ben Rhydding, near Ilkley.
The RAC was called out to deal with a 120,158 drivers, a record number
of cars over the festive period, a spokeswoman said last night.

<TEXT>
Industrial correspondent ROY ROGERS reports on the keynote address
made yesterday to the British Psychology Society's conference in Warwick
BRITAIN appears to be accelerating into an age of employment
uncertainty and ''contract culture'' which is escalating workplace
stress.
This was the main theme of a keynote address yesterday to the British
Psychology Society's occupational psychology conference at Warwick
University.
Professor Cary Cooper, of the University of Manchester School of
Science and Technology, suggested that this growing sense of insecurity
was the main reason for the lack of a ''feel-good factor'' in Britain.
Larger employers, often led by the privatised utilities, were
increasingly shedding middle management and professional grades and
resorting more and more to ''outsourcing'', short-term contracts and the
use of freelances.
They were, therefore, becoming exposed to the uncertainties felt by
manual workers, who have traditionally been laid off or made redundant
when markets became depressed.
Ironically, those blue-collar workers who survive the onslaught of new
technology could become among the most secure employees in the land, he
said.
Not only were employees fearful of losing their jobs, they were also
beginning to realise that there was little or no chance of finding
similar employment because it was rapidly ceasing to exist.
This growing insecurity was leading employees to work longer hours in
a bid to avoid the next tranche of redundancies and, with both parents
working in almost two out of three families, family life was also under
threat.
Professor Cooper recommended annual stress audits, stress management
programmes, and workplace counselling to combat stress, which is already
seen as a major factor in the #11 billion cost of sickness absence from
work.
These costs were set to increase dramatically in the light of the
recent High Court decision in favour of Northumberland County Council
social work manager Mr John Walker.
In the first landmark stress- at-work case, Mr Walker's employers were
found to have been at fault for his excessive workload which contributed
to two nervous breakdowns. Mr Walker is now claiming up to #200,000 for
loss of earnings.
For Professor Cooper, the key aspect of the judgment was that
employers were deemed to have a ''duty of care'' over how they manage
not only their equipment or physical environment but also their
employees, including their workload.
He is currently undertaking a study of several dozen other cases of
stress- related legal claims in the pipeline, including several in
Scotland.
These are all seen as very strong cases that occurred over the past
five years. However, like others, Professor Cooper said he feared that
the Walker judgment might result in employers ditching workers at the
first sign of stress.

SNP LEADER Alex Salmond yesterday challenged the Prime Minister to say
where he stood on Scottish democratic rights.
Mr Salmond said John Major had caused controversy by attacking
confusion in Labour's devolution plans in an interview last Friday on
BBC Radio. However, a closer look at what he said showed that Mr Major
was also confused on the key question of Scotland's right to
self-determination.
Mr Salmond said: ''Mr Major seems keen to ask questions of other
people but now he has to answer some himself.''
The SNP leader said he had written to Mr Major to demand some answers.
In his letter, Mr Salmond says: ''In your New Year interview, you
asked what an SNP majority would do in any future Scottish assembly.
''The answer is quite clear. We would open up negotiations for
Scottish independence, having secured a democratic mandate from the
Scottish people. This is the same as our policy on a majority of MPs at
a Westminster election.
''What I would like to know from you is this. In the unlikely event of
you still being Prime Minister at this time, would you then accept the
democratic wish of the Scottish people in favour of independence?
''Given that you are now arguing that devolution would lead inevitably
to independence, you do appear to imply an acceptance of that
position.''

BRITISH Gas has been forced to introduce security guards to protect
showroom staff from angry customers, it was confirmed yesterday.
However, Scottish stores so far have escaped the measure.
A spokeswoman for British Gas Retail said guards had been provided in
26 of the company's 266 main gas showrooms in the UK because of the
''public backlash'' against staff after all services covering payments,
queries, and gas equipment repairs were withdrawn.
The move followed requests from the management, staff, or gas union
representatives. The spokeswoman said no such requests had been received
in Scotland.
From yesterday, gas showrooms throughout the UK became purely retail
outlets.
About 25% of Scotland's 1.3m British Gas consumers currently pay their
bills in person at its shops. They will be able to do this at post
offices instead, but British Gas is trying to encourage the use of
direct debit payments.
The showrooms also will no longer deal with inquiries or complaints
about services and these will have to made to the company by telephone
or letter.
Labour's Shadow Consumer Minister Nigel Griffiths earlier had claimed
that the guards were being introduced in 25 showrooms throughout the UK,
including Glasgow.
He described the action of British Gas as ''irresponsible and
disgraceful'' and said it must be reversed immediately.
''This fiasco is the final straw,'' he said. ''Gas customers are
having to pay more than #30,000 a month for these guards simply to pay
for the problems created by the appalling behaviour of British Gas.''
The MP for Edinburgh South also claimed that one disgruntled customer
had assaulted a British Gas showroom employee after the bill payment
service was withdrawn. However, this claim was rejected by a company
spokeswoman.
She said: ''There was a difficult customer in one of our shops in
Huddersfield who was very unhappy about some of the things we were doing
who refused to leave the shop. But the police were called and ejected
the person. No member of staff was assaulted.''
Mr Dave Stirzaker, chief negotiator for Unison's 30,000 gas workers,
said: ''These cuts in services were against the wishes of the vast
majority of the 18 million gas customers whose needs are being ignored
in the drive for profits.
''The company is in danger of losing touch with its customers.''
The latest row follows a British Gas decision to cut showroom staff
pay while awarding its chief executive, Mr Cedric Brown, a 75% pay rise.

Geneva, Tuesday
THE number of Aids cases officially reported worldwide has topped the
million mark for the first time -- a 20% rise from a year ago, the World
Health Organisation (WHO) said today.
However the UN agency, pointing to incomplete reporting and
under-diagnosis, estimated the actual number of people who have Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome at 4.5 million.
A cumulative total of 19.5 million people have been infected with the
HIV virus since the pandemic began in the late 1970s, including 1.5
million children, according to latest figures. Between 13 and 15 million
of those infected are believed to be still alive.
WHO said 1.025 million cumulative cases of Aids in adults and children
had been reported by 192 states by the end of last year. This
represented a 20% increase on those reported a year ago.
''The major proportion of these cases have occurred in sub-Saharan
Africa and the Americas,'' WHO said in a statement.
Regarding the 19.5 million people who have contracted the HIV virus,
this was nearly two million more since WHO's semi-annual report on July
1.
Africa has reported 34% of the total Aids cases, or 345,639 people,
but probably accounts for 70% of the total estimated figure of 4.5
million.
The United States, where diagnosis is quicker and reporting more
immediate, accounts for 39% of the reported Aids cases. However, this
probably represents only 9% of the actual total.
France tops Europe's list with 32,722 reported Aids cases, followed by
Spain (27,584), Italy (24,511), Germany (11,854), and the United Kingdom
(9865).--Reuter.

RELATIONS were frosty between the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of
York yesterday as the Prince took to the slopes for the first time on
his holiday with his sons, William and Harry.
The two royal ski-ing parties were in the same area of the Klosters
resort in Switzerland and ended up in the mountain restaurant together
when poor weather forced them inside.
However, while the Duchess's daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, joined
their cousins, William and Harry, for hot drinks, the Duchess remained
at a separate table.
The Prince is known for his coolness towards his sister-in-law since
her separation from the Duke.
The Duchess said as she later left the restaurant to continue ski-ing
with her daughters that she was not asked to join Charles's table.
The presence of the two royal ski-ing parties in the same resort has
been avoided in the past, but it was understood that the Duchess refused
to change her schedule, having booked this week in Klosters.
Earlier, the Prince's private secretary, Commander Richard Aylard,
denied that the Duchess had to move apartments to allow the Prince to
stay in his usual hotel suite.
The Duchess's presence on the slopes yesterday intruded on the
traditional photocall with the three Princes.
As about 60 reporters and cameramen waited for more than an hour with
the weather closing in to near blizzard conditions, the Duchess and
Beatrice, six, and Eugenie, four, appeared on the slope above.
After some hesitation, they skied past the group without stopping.
A few minutes later, the Prince of Wales, William and Harry skied down
and posed for pictures.
The Prince was in a chatty mood and he joked with photographers. ''It
was snowing in the UK -- we have brought it with us,'' he said.
The two boys posed with their father in the middle of the slope but as
they moved off William took a tumble.
He lost a ski in the fall and his father helped him to his feet.
With the Prince's party was the Palmer-Tomkinson family, close friends
of Charles, and royal aide Tiggy Legge-Bourke.
After the photocall, everyone headed for the restaurant to shelter
from the -15C conditions. The two royal parties found themselves in an
upstairs part of the restaurant, and after half-an-hour the Prince's
group left to go down the mountain for lunch.
Commander Aylard said that the Prince and Duchess had had a cordial
glass of champagne together on Monday night when the Prince's party
arrived in the resort and chatted together within the group.
Meanwhile, the young Princes and Princesses enjoyed a snowball fight
together in the deep snow after the day's skiing was over.
William and Harry also took part in some tobogganing.
Last night, it was said that the two royal parties were again having a
drink at the Walserhof Hotel.

A FIRE at historic Frogmore House in the grounds of Windsor Castle
marred the Queen's New Year, it emerged yesterday.
Buckingham Palace confirmed that the castle's fire brigade put out a
''smouldering fire'', discovered in the early hours of New Year's Day,
in a staff toilet block.
The fire was caused by a water heater above a basin in the basement
block, which suffered ''superficial smoke damage'', said a palace
spokeswoman.
''The alarm system worked well and the local fire brigade also
attended,'' she said.
The spokeswoman could not confirm reports that the water heater had
been left on for two weeks during the Christmas-New Year break.
The Queen and members of the royal family were at Sandringham in
Norfolk at the time of the fire, which was the third alert at Windsor in
recent months.
Just before Christmas, the Queen used a soda siphon to tackle a
fireplace blow-back caused by a blocked flue in the Oak Room of the
castle.
Last summer, a bedside lamp started a fire in an unused bedroom off St
John's Tower.
In 1992, a huge blaze caused #40m worth of damage.
Frogmore House, which stands about half a mile south of the castle in
Windsor Home Park, is used occasionally by the royal family.

<TEXT>
EXPLORATORY drilling for oil and gas at Windsor Castle could be
approved today.
County councillors are to consider an application which has been
backed by planning and environment officers.
The Queen already has consented to the controversial scheme, which
would involve drilling a bore hole 300 to 400 metres deep in Windsor
Home Park, 600 metres from the castle.
The application is by Canuk Exploration, and Berkshire County Council
officers have recommended that temporary planning permission be granted
for initial drilling.
In a report to Berkshire councillors, the county's environment officer
says: ''The site is located in an area where noise, general disturbance
and visual impact would be minimal.''
However, the royal borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, and the Council
for the Protection of Rural England strongly object to the proposal,
arguing drilling would be most inappropriate on an environmentally
sensitive and historic site situated in Green Belt parkland.
The county council report said there was approximately a one in eight
chance of finding any oil and gas.
The State, and not the Queen, would stand to gain most from any find,
which could be worth up to #1000m.
If oil is discovered in commercial quantities, a further planning
application would be necessary for extraction.

LABOUR MP Gordon Brown has called for an inquiry into the health risks
posed by dangerously high levels of benzene, a cancer-causing pollutant,
discovered in Fife.
The move follows The Herald's disclosure yesterday that an
investigation had found high levels of benzene -- which is implicated in
childhood leukemia -- while monitoring air pollution from the
Mossmorran/Braefoot Bay petrochemical complex.
The report of the study, headed by a professor at St Andrews
University, is in the hands of Fife Regional Council and will be
discussed at a planning meeting this month.
Mr Brown, MP for Dunfermline East, said: ''I am now demanding that
Scottish Health Minister Lord Fraser should instigate a full health
inquiry into the higher than normal benzene levels in the Aberdour
area.''
The Herald disclosed yesterday that the main source of benzene comes
from loading techniques at the petrochemical complex.
Regional council leader John MacDougall said the council would pay
particular attention to a view expressed in the report that urgent
action should be taken to control emissions during tanker loading.
Dr Morrice McCrae, a specialist in child health who first raised the
dangers of benzene emissions with the local authorities and oil
companies two years ago, yesterday strongly criticised the claim that
annual concentrations of the pollutant were likely to be less than the
Government's recommended five parts per billion.
''What evidence there is shows that it is short-term exposure to high
benzene levels which is the major risk. That arises during loading.''
The investigation was conducted by the Air Quality Review Group, set
up two years ago by local authorities, following concerns about health
risks from the petrochemical complex.
In response to the Herald story, Fife Regional Council said the study
had shown air quality consistent with previous surveys in the area.
However, benzene levels never figured as a concern in previous
monitoring. It was only when new and sensitive equipment became
available to the monitoring committee two years ago that it was able to
begin taking precise measures of benzene.
In April, Government experts set a level of five parts per billion as
an acceptable risk level, saying this should be reduce to one ppb.
The Herald understands that concentrations of 14 times the official
safe level were measured during monitoring in some areas.

Grozny, Tuesday
CHECHEN rebels battled Russian troops in the centre of Grozny for a
third day on streets lined with gutted buildings, burnt-out tanks, and
dozens of corpses.
Russian Government statements said the Kremlin's troops had gained
ground three days after a tank-led Russian advance into the city to oust
separatist President Dzhokhar Dudayev.
However news videotape coverage showed Chechen fighters moving
unimpeded through city-centre districts.
Some opened fire on Russian troops from behind trees or kiosks. Others
advanced warily along streets with downed trolley-bus lines and
buildings blackened and pulverised by three weeks of Russian air raids.
In Moscow, Yegor Gaidar, who led Russia's reform programme after the
fall of communism and was once President Boris Yeltsin's close ally,
warned that the conflict threatened Russia with authoritarian rule. The
former Prime Minister voiced the rising anger of many Russians over what
is being widely condemned as a badly thought-out Russian operation.
Blaming hardline Yeltsin aides for the ''military catastrophe'',
Gaidar said the Russian Government could be replaced by or transformed
into an authoritarian regime.
''Events there bear witness once again to the adventurist nature of
the chosen course of a military solution to the problem and at the same
time sharply exacerbate the threat of an authoritarian regime being
formed in Russia,'' he told a news conference.
Gaidar said he was trying to convene an urgent meeting of Parliament
to discuss Chechnya and would propose hearings ''to expose all those who
were responsible for the military operations carried out there''.
Television showed smoke rising from near Dudayev's presidential palace
today but his whereabouts were unknown.
In a television appearance yesterday, he called for fresh talks to end
the Russian push on Grozny and suggested that Russian soldiers held
prisoner could otherwise be killed.
In a letter offering talks to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
Dudayev said the final push into Grozny had been a ''catastrophe for the
attackers and a tragedy for the defenders''.
Interfax news agency said its correspondent in Grozny had reported
that rebels were still keeping Russian troops well away from the palace.
It said the main fighting was near the railway station, a mile west of
the palace.
''Alongside the presidential palace and on its approaches to the north
and north-west are dozens of destroyed Russian armoured vehicles,''
Interfax reported. ''All around lie the bodies of servicemen. Our
correspondent counted about 100 dead Russian servicemen on the streets
around the palace.''
Russian Government statements yesterday said Russian forces had
''regrouped'' after losing several dozen tanks as the advance ran into
stiff resistance. Later, however, they said Russian troops had gained
new ground and secured control of main strategic positions.
Yeltsin sent thousands of troops into Chechnya on December 11, saying
Dudayev's government was harbouring criminals and vowing to crush his
three-year drive to secure independence from Moscow.
However the action has tended to galvanise the resistance of Chechens,
many of whom were previously unsympathetic to Dudayev.
In Moscow, Russian MPs back from a three-week stay in Grozny urged
Yeltsin to halt the advance and resume talks with Chechen leaders.
''Our soldiers of 18 and 19 are lying in the streets in their
hundreds, uncollected three days after being killed,'' said MP Viktor
Korochkin.
Russia faces the choice of unleashing all-out force on Grozny or
withdrawing in humiliation. Western commentators said both options
spelled political disaster for Yeltsin and could lead Moscow into a new
era of authoritarian rule.
''The army is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea -- to
raze the city would be just as politically unacceptable as withdrawal,''
said one Western military expert -- Reuter.

POLICE were investigating a double death mystery last night after the
bodies of a couple were found sprawled in adjoining bedrooms at a house
in Burnham, Buckinghamshire.
Shocked relatives made the discovery when they arrived at the couple's
home shortly after 2pm. The body of the housewife, believed to be in her
mid-30s, was found in one bedroom. She appeared to have been battered to
death.
Lying in an adjoining room was her husband's body.
There were no immediate clues to the cause of his death, although it
was thought he might have died as a result of an overdose. Police have
not yet named the victims.
A murder investigation, under the direction of Detective
Superintendent John Stowe, was launched, and the couple's home in
Coniston Crescent, Burnham, was sealed off.
Detective Chief Inspector Geoff Chivers said the bodies were found by
relatives, who arrived at the red brick semi-detached house after
becoming worried about their circumstances.

POLICE investigating the Aviemore hotel fire which killed leading
Scottish industrialist Graham Strachan and a 55-year-old woman on New
Year's Day have appealed for information about anyone seen acting
suspiciously near the building.
A Northern Constabulary spokeswoman said last night that the appeal
did not mean they believed the fire was started deliberately, but simply
that they were covering all eventualities until a cause had been
established.
If it was discovered that the fire was started deliberately, the
investigation could turn into a murder inquiry.
The police statement asked for information about anyone who may have
been seen acting suspiciously near the Four Seasons Hotel car park just
an hour before the fire started. Specifically, they want to hear from
anyone who may have been in the vicinity of the hotel between 3am and
4.40am, when the fire was discovered, to come forward. A fire brigade
spokeswoman said last night she could not elaborate on the police
statement.
A spokesman for the Stakis organisation, which runs the hotel, said
last night: ''The police and fire service are continuing their very full
inquiry into the cause, and the process they go through will include
requests for information like this.''
The fire started in the hotel's kitchen store, which contained a
number of chairs, and the burning upholstery caused the choking smoke
which billowed throughout the hotel.
The wind also blew smoke back into the building. At the time,
firefighters expressed surprise that there was so much smoke in the
escape routes and said it was one of the questions to be answered by the
investigators.
Almost 200 people, including 32 children, were evacuated from the
building. Seven needed first aid.
Mr Strachan, 63, a director of Scott Lithgow since 1984, had gone to
Aviemore with his wife, Catherine, to bring in the New Year. Mrs
Strachan was taken to Raigmore Hospital to be treated for smoke
inhalation after the fire.
The woman who died was Mrs Patricia Shaw, of Kippax, in Leeds. She
died as she was being evacuated by ladder. Mr Strachan was found on a
staircase directly above where the fire started.
Fire brigade units and ambulances drove through blizzards on
treacherous roads to reach the scene. Highlands and Islands Fire Brigade
deputy fire chief paid tribute to his six part-timers in Aviemore, who
managed to contain the fire until their colleagues arrived.
The hotel had been filled with skiers and other holidaymakers
celebrating New Year in the Highlands.

Buenos Aires, Tuesday
ARGENTINA warned today that Britain's extension of a fishing
conservation zone around the Falklands has raised the risk of fresh
conflict between the former foes, but said it was eager to avoid
trouble.
In apparently contradictory statements, Foreign Minister Guido Di
Tella spoke of ''a situation of potential conflict'' while President
Carlos Menem said: ''It is not going to cloud our relationship with
Great Britain.''
Both were responding to reports that Di Tella had alerted the United
States about the risk of clashes between British and Argentine navy
vessels patrolling a strip of ocean known as ''the Gap''.
There are two long, thin gaps between Argentina's 200-mile exclusion
zone and the Falklands conservation zone in waters to the north and
south of the islands.
Britain decided last September to incorporate the northern gap into
the 50-mile Falklands Outer Conservation Zone.
''The Argentines aren't at all happy about it, but Britain does not
recognise any Argentine jurisdiction to patrol waters beyond its
200-mile limit,'' said a British diplomat.
Di Tella told Argentine radio: ''I do not want to blow this up or say
tragedy is imminent. There is an extremely annoying and risky situation
. . .
''We hope there are no incidents but we are going to continue
supervising and controlling the area in question.''
Menem repeated his oft-stated pledge that ''before 2000 the Malvinas
will be Argentine again'', but stressed the dispute would be solved by
dialogue: ''There will be no fighting.''
Meanwhile, di Tella delighted Falkland islanders by sending them
Christmas cards with place names given in the English rather than
Argentine translation.
Residents said it was the first time in 160 years that Argentina had
done so. The cards, delivered late to 500 homes, were addressed to the
Falkland-Malvinas islands, and to Port Stanley rather than Puerto
Argentino.
Di Tella has predicted that Britain will hand the islands over to
Argentina in 1997, the year it cedes sovereignty over Hong Kong to
China.

Johannesburg, Tuesday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela has told South Africa's ambassador-designate
to the United Nations, Allan Boesak, to withdraw from the post after
allegations of financial irregularities.
The South African Press Association quoted African National Congress
sources as saying the President had met veteran anti-apartheid activist
Boesak on New Year's Eve and told him to quit.
Scandinavian aid agencies are looking into allegations of misuse of
anti-apartheid funds provided to Boesak's Foundation for Peace and
Justice (FPJ).
The FPJ received 7.2 million Danish crowns (#770,000) over the past
two years from aid bodies of the Lutheran state church in Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway.
Several newspapers have reported allegations from Scandinavian aid
agencies that the FPJ lent one staff member about #133,000 for a house
and that Boesak borrowed #19,000 towards the cost of his own luxury
home.
Sapa quoted ANC sources as saying Boesak was facing a fait accompli
and had been given notice by Mandela that he should withdraw.
The agency said Mandela was upset when he told Boesak that failure to
do so could force the president's hand into demanding his departure.
Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, refused to confirm or deny the
report but said Mandela was ''keen to find an early, just, and fair
resolution of this problem''.
Boesak has generally refused to speak to reporters about the
controversy.--Reuter.

FIREFIGHTERS yesterday tried to stop a fire engulfing Caldwell House,
the home of Dr Sohail Chaudhry. Last month Dr Chaudhry had the licence
for his nearby residential home in Uplawmoor, Renfrewshire, revoked
after claims that elderly people had been neglected.
The emergency services were called to the blaze in the three-storey
building at about 1.30pm yesterday. The house sits at the head of a
badly rutted drive, about one mile from the Caldwell House residential
home.
Mr John Williamson, senior divisional officer with Strathclyde Fire
Brigade, said firefighters wearing breathing appartus had searched Dr
Chaudhry's three-storey home but the building was empty.
The residential home itself was in darkness last night. Social workers
last month removed residents after Strathclyde councillors decided that
the home's registration should be cancelled.
Dr Chaudhry at the time claimed he had been the victim of ''different
kinds of prejudice'' and ''over-zealous'' social workers. While he
accepted that his residential home business was finished, he said he was
considering an appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland in order to
clear his name.
He said: ''I'm not saying it was racial prejudice but social workers
often go to extremes to protect their empires, as they did in Orkney and
at Cleveland.''
Last night, it was believed that Dr Chaudhry was in Manchester with
his family and that they were unaware of the fire.
Dr Chaudhry's handyman, Mr David McMillan, of Johnstone, said his
employer had come to his house on Monday night to say that a relation
had died and that he was going to Manchester for the funeral.
Mr McMillan, who carries out work on some 30 flats for Dr Chaudhry,
said Dr Chaudhry lived on the top floor of the building with his wife
and two children. Dr Chaudhry's brother, his wife and five children,
lived in the flat below, he said.
According to Mr McMillan, the fire was spotted by a local man. The man
is understood to have gone into the blazing building to check if anyone
needed help but was forced to retreat by the fierce heat.
A police spokesman said he believed that no-one had been staying at
the house since December 31. ''We are trying to contact Dr Chaudhry in
Manchester.''
About 35 firefighters backed by seven engines and a turntable ladder
fought the blaze, hampered by the sub zero conditions.
Mr Williamson said his men had had to run hoses for more than a mile
back to the road because water that they might have used nearby was
frozen.
He said: ''We have had to take great care because the conditions have
been treacherous. The external fire escapes, for instance, are frozen.''
Mr Williamson said he had also had to call on the region's gritters to
help the fire engines gain access.
He added: ''We will be here all night but hope to have the blaze under
control soon. We are on the right side of it.''
He said he had no idea at the moment how the fire had started. ''We
will be holding a full investigation,'' he said.
The fire had badly damaged the roof and a side of the building but Mr
Williamson said it was impossible to put a figure on the cost of the
damage.
Last month, The Herald highlighted a social work department report
which revealed disturbing shortcomings in the standard of care at
Caldwell House residential home. Three days later a social work
sub-committee decided the registration of the home should be cancelled.
Caldwell House was first registered as a residential home on February
6, 1991, in the names of the present proprietors Dr Chaudhry and Mrs
Naghmana Chaudhry to accommodate 31 elderly people. It is believed that
Dr Chaudhry has put the home on the market.

BRUSSELS: Six Britons were arrested in Belgium yesterday after police
seized a record 200,000 ecstasy pills in a #5m drugs haul. ''It's the
largest seizure of ecstasy pills in Belgium and probably the biggest in
Europe,'' said a spokesman. The seizure followed the discovery of one
tonne of hashish and marijuana on Monday. The drugs were found when
police stopped a small van carrying four Britons on the ring road round
the northern port of Antwerp. The two others,including the suspected
gang leader, were arrested in Bruges.

THE SCOTTISH Secretary must tighten the guidelines governing the
interests of local enterprise company directors to respond to concerns
among the Scottish business community, according to Labour MP Brian
Donohoe.
Mr Donohoe, who has compiled a list of funds paid to directors'
companies from the LECS' annual reports, said more detail was needed
about such transactions.
The Cunninghame South MP said the lists showed that 5.1% of the
operational expenditure of the LECs operating under Highlands and
Islands Enterprise was spent on transactions involving directors,
compared with 1.4% for LECS under Scottish Enterprise.
His examination also showed that within the HIE network the levels of
transactions involving directors ranged from 22% of the #1.49m budget of
Skye and Lochalsh LEC to only 0.2% for Inverness and Nairn LEC.
Mr Donohoe said he was not suggesting there was any wrongdoing on the
part of LECs or their directors, and all the LECs had stressed there was
no impropriety involved.
Mr Donohoe added:
''This year the LECS were instructed to declare transactions involving
their directors as part of their annual report. Next year the LECs
should be asked to declare publicly every project they have been
involved in and the amount of public money involved.''
Mr Donohoe said the Scottish Office must also launch an investigation
to find out why there are such large differences between the amounts of
money LECs are paying out in transactions with their directors'
companies.
0 The Herald highlighted confusion over LEC directors' interests in an
investigation in November 1993.
A Scottish Enterprise spokesman said last night that the scrutiny and
regulations covering LEC board members' interests were stringent.
The spokesman said every allegation raised in the past had been
extensively investigated and there had never been any case to answer.

WOMEN smile more than men during a job interview and are better
prepared, but do not always benefit from their behaviour, according to a
new study.
Simulated interviews involving 60 Manchester teenagers found that
women used more eye contact as well as more smiles.
Another study of 300 teenagers from across the country showed that
women believed enthusiasm, reliability and communication skills should
be displayed during interviews.
Women behave more openly during job interviews, according to the
findings which were presented to the British Psychological Society's
annual occupational psychology conference at Warwick University.
However, Myrte Ferwerda, of the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology, said it was incorrect to conclude that women
were evaluated more positively by interviewers.
''Female interviewees may go too far in their use of, for example,
smiling and eye contact. Factors linked withy sex stereotypes, such as
assumed lack of leadership qualities, may over-ride the importance of
expressive behaviour in decision-making.''

A LABOUR bid to remove charitable status from independent schools was
given weight by deputy leader John Prescott yesterday. ''It is right for
us to question that kind of privilege in our society,'' he said.
In a bid to defuse the controversial remarks of Shadow Education
Secretary David Blunkett, who floated VAT on school fees, Mr Prescott
claimed: ''David Blunkett said it was on the table, neither ruled in or
out. But that has been ruled out a couple of months ago.''
He confessed a muddle. ''It was ruled out, but it wasn't actually told
to David''.
But he supported the concept of removing the valuable charitable
status from independent schools. He said #800m was being cut from state
school funding, while the private sector had classes half their size
enjoying a subsidy.
Party spokesmen would have to be more careful in the future, he said.
''I think we have been so long in opposition that we tend to be a little
bit loose with our language, including myself.''

AN EXILED Scot has kept national pride intact by not only holding his
drink, but being able to tell one kind from another by the end of the
night.
The unnamed volunteer was the only one of four human guinea pigs who
was able consistently to distinguish malt whisky from brandy, and one
brand of each from another.
The study, carried out in Ontario, Canada, and reported in the British
Medical Journal, entailed a blindfold tasting session of rigorous
proportions interrupted by a light supper, in which the Scot was
compared with a Scots-Irish participant, a New Zealander, and a
Canadian.
Two of the others had only partial success rates, scoring 34-48 and
31-48 correct samples respectively. The third, at 25-48, could obviously
have done as well by tossing a coin, although he wouldn't have enjoyed
it as much.
However, the Scot stood -- if that's the right description -- head and
shoulders above the rest. His score of 50-51 showed that he not only
knew his Courvoisier from his Remy Martin and Glenfiddich from his
Springbank, but he was still participating in the study a good three
sips after the others had dropped out.
Who was this connoisseur? The researchers, Dr Moran Campbell, Diana
Campbell and Professor Robin Roberts, do not say, but there may be one
clue in the acknowledgments at the end. Together with the duty-free
shops at Gatwick, Heathrow, and Toronto airports (for making the study
possible) they thank the former Glasgow rheumatologist, Professor Watson
Buchanan, for lacing their reports with a few choice Gaelic phrases.
Need other lovers of the amber nectar feel inferior by comparison?
Perhaps not. Dr John Piggott, a specialist in whisky flavour at
Strathclyde University's Bioscience and Biotechnology Department, said
yesterday: ''I don't think I could guarantee to get it right every time.
There is an overlap in taste between brandy and malt whisky.''
Familiarity with the range of flavours would make it much easier, but
the technique is important, says Dr Piggott. One way is to leave a
residue in the bottom of the glass for a while and then sniff the
bouquet, so that you can pick out the taste of the malt and the wood the
drink was aged in.
That might be more accurate, but not half as much fun.

THE FUTURE of the Health Care International hospital in Clydebank
appeared to have been secured last night with the announcement of a
take-over by a Middle East consortium.
The group, led by the Abu Dhabi Investment Company, has signed an
agreement in principal to buy the hospital and its adjoining hotel,
opened last spring at a cost of #180m and in receivership since
November.
Negotiations will continue over the next few weeks to resolve what
were described as a number of outstanding complex issues, but receiver
Mr Murdoch McKillop, of Arthur Andersen, said last night that the
consortium had indicated that they intend to develop the hospital as a
centre of international medical excellence.
If that intention is fulfilled -- removing the spectre of private
sector inroads in the National Health Service -- it will be unopposed by
Labour and the political backlash, directed at the Government, will now
centre on the price being paid.
HCI -- the brainchild of Boston doctors Angelo Eraklis and Raphael
Levey -- came to Clydebank backed by up to #40m from the Scottish Office
and other public sector agencies, with the aim of attracting patients
from abroad for hi-tech tertiary health care.
''This is a major step forward in securing the future of the
facilities at Clydebank, but we have some way to go before the
transaction is complete,'' Mr McKillop said.
A number of other parties had expressed serious interest in taking
over the troubled site, but Mr McKillop and joint-receiver John Talbot
had embarked on a ''preferred bidder'' strategy to woo the Abu Dhabi
consortium which, crucially, has the possibility of a flow of up to 2500
patients a year to Clydebank guaranteed by the Gulf state's government.
It was the paucity of overseas business -- a trickle compared to the
levels envisaged when the project was conceived seven years ago -- which
led to the demise of HCI.
Now its 350 workers, many of whom will be returning today from their
Christmas break, will be told formally at a meeting with the receivers
this morning that the New Year has brought the hospital a new lease of
life.
Dr Larry Hollier, the Medical Director, said last night: ''Word has
already got round and I think everyone is very pleased. It is consistent
with the optimism we have had that this is a viable entity.''
Like most hospitals HCI has had a planned slow-down in activity over
the holiday period, but Dr Hollier said they had several hundred
patients scheduled for examinations or operations over the next few
weeks.
The local MP, Mr Tony Worthington said: ''This is good news for the
people working at HCI. I have heard no-one criticise the quality of the
staff.
''The great virtue of this deal is that it brings together patients
and money. I am hoping to talk to the management about what agreement
has been reached on patients, and I hope the deal means the other Gulf
states will be coming in with Abu Dhabi to guarantee patients.
''The best future for the hospital is that they work for the original
purpose, of catering for overseas patients. The acute services strategy
produced by Greater Glasow Health Board shows how impossible it would be
to graft this hospital on to the NHS.
''We are now going to find out if the idea was flawed from the start
or if the problems were down to the management. We will see now see if
it can take off under new management and under the much more favourable
conditions of having got rid of the debt.''
Joint receiver Murdoch McKillop was reluctant to add to his formal
statement last night.
He told the Herald there had been nothing sinister in the delay in
naming HCI's preferred bidder, anticipated since before Christmas. ''It
was just the problem of holidays getting in the way,'' he said.
Mr McKillop refused to be drawn on the price the consortium is likely
to pay. But it will certainly be a great deal less than the #180m it
cost to create the medical complex in the first place.

LABOUR, flushed with success after the Government's humiliating
about-face over VAT on fuel, now has its sights set on shattering rail
privatisation.
The Opposition is so confident of growing public support for its
campaign to protect lines and services, it believes U-turns are
inevitable in the sell-off process.
Labour's Transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, yesterday also warned
off potential investors in Railtrack by insisting that his party, in
power, would never commit to ''a subsidy regime that featherbeds
shareholders''.
A huge campaign against rail privatisation, dubbed ''the poll tax on
wheels'', will be formally launched inside two weeks. It is aimed at:
* Preventing line closures and service cuts, by forcing Government
climbdowns on privatisation and cash squeezes on train operators.
* Blocking the sale of Railtrack, by pledging that a Labour Government
would not allow taxpayers to subsidise a private concern that ''did
nothing for passenger convenience''.
* Putting MPs in Tory-held marginals under pressure to rebel over rail
privatisation, by highlighting just how ''damaging and ludicrous'' their
support is.
Mr McLeish confirmed he is putting the finishing touches to a
nationwide campaign which, in Scotland, would add fresh impetus to
saving the Fort William-London sleeper service and Motorail, plus
preserving special holiday rail services.
The campaign also will highlight:
* An investment freeze on new rolling stock orders until at least 1997
because of Government cuts and the uncertainty created by privatisation.
* ScotRail payments of #175m to Railtrack this year for track access,
the same as the Network South East trains' operator, whose passenger
revenue is #224m compared with ScotRail's #91m.
Mr McLeish said the campaign would underline how damaging rail
privatisation will be for taxpayers as well as passengers. ''It can do
for the Government what the poll tax did a few years ago.''
He continued: ''The campaign is designed to force the Government into
as many U-turns as possible, including the delay -- or destruction of --
the privatisation timetable.
''The Tories are wakening up to the fact they face humiliation at the
next General Election. We say changes will be brought about in rail
privatisation, as has happened with the poll tax, Post Office
privatisation, and the second tranche of VAT on fuel.''
Labour will also ask the all-party Transport Select Committee to study
British Rail finances, with special reference to the financial crisis
faced by ScotRail because of subsidy cuts.
It is due to be privatised before the end of this year, but has
already warned up to 600 jobs are at risk if cost-cutting targets are to
be met by then.
Mr McLeish stressed his party is committed to a continuing high level
of subsidy for rail services, but said of a privatised Railtrack --
responsible for all infrastructure: ''We will campaign in the City of
London to alert potential investors that we think it is a crazy idea.''
He added: ''If it goes ahead, a Labour Government would not commit to
a subsidy regime that featherbedded shareholders in a private company,
artificially created, that did nothing for passengers . . .''
He said taxpayers should not be expected to provide Railtrack with
profits via annual subsidies paid to train operators, but then passed on
to the company for access to lines and stations.
The rail union RMT is seeking a judicial review of the Government's
proposals to sell off Railtrack, arguing that Ministers are acting
outwith their powers in privatising the infrastructure.

MUSLIM fundamentalists are threatening to kill Britons ''in cold
blood'' unless the Government closes the embassy in Algeria.
The threat is believed to have been made by the same group responsible
for the hijacking and murder of hostages on an Air France jet at
Christmas.
The ruthless Armed Islamic Group, at the heart of a bloody struggle
against the Algerian government, set a deadline to evacuate the embassy
of January 7.
The Foreign Office said a letter, written in German and posted in
France, was received at the British embassy in Berne, Switzerland.
The chilling letter, sent to several Western governments, warned:
''All contact with our country should be broken by January 7 and the
embassy should be cleared.
''We cannot guarantee the lives of foreign nationals after the expiry
of this ultimatum. After that, all unbelievers will be killed in cold
blood.''
The violent Islamic uprising in Algeria has already seen some 70
foreigners murdered.
The Foreign Office said staffing of the embassy in Algiers was being
kept under constant review.
Ambassador Christopher Crabbie now heads a team of four, which was cut
from six last month in advance of the Air France hijacking. They are
protected by a team of military police and take careful precautions in
their daily lives.
The exact number of Britons living in Algeria is unknown but is
believed to be about 130.

BT was yesterday accused of taking advantage of its near-monopoly
after raising line rental charges by nearly twice the rate of inflation.
Critics warned that the move would deter many people in low-income
groups from installing a telephone.
The company said the 4.6% increase, which raises a residential
quarterly bill by #1.10 to #24.79 and a business bill by #1.77 to
#40.15, was unavoidable.
However the Telecommunications Users' Association watchdog questioned
the justification of the move, and suggested that BT was taking
advantage of its near monopoly of exchange lines.
''We have serious doubts as to whether such increases are justified,''
said TUA executive chairman Bill Mieran. ''It is not a coincidence that
we only see price increases in areas where BT has a virtual monopoly of
supply.''
He added: ''We badly need a competitor who is prepared to invest in a
truly national network and become a real alternative to BT
door-to-door.''
Labour's consumer affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths said the move
would ''put even more people off getting a telephone.''
He added: ''Already, fewer senior citizens and others have access to a
phone in Britain than in France, America, Sweden and a number of
comparable countries.
''BT should be forced by the regulator to reduce standing charges, not
increase them.''
Mr Griffiths, MP for Edinburgh South, is to raise the matter in
Parliament next week.
The increase is the maximum BT can impose under rules set by industry
regulator the Office of Telecommuncations (Oftel) to protect consumers.
Oftel says line rental can be increased by no more than 2% above
inflation -- and inflation is currently 2.6%.
BT sweetened the pill for consumers by announcing large cuts in the
cost of calling the US and Canada.
However, it will benefit from the overall package by #73m a year. A
spokesman said the line rental increases would bring in #108m and the
international call cuts would take out #35m.
The call reductions are part of a #400m package of price cuts BT must
make by August as part of a deal agreed with Oftel.

THE Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, faced renewed calls for his
resignation last night as three dangerous inmates escaped from a top
security prison and prisoners went on the rampage for the second night
running at another jail.
The three broke out of Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight. The
public was warned not to tackle the escapees, two of whom are Category A
prisoners.
A ring of police was thrown around the prison soon after the escape
was discovered at 8pm last night.
Tracker dogs were being used in dense woodland and a police spotter
plane was combing the area with searchlights. Ferry terminals were being
watched.
They were named by police as Keith Rose, 45, serving life for murder;
Matthew Williams, 25, serving life for conspiracy to cause explosions;
and Andrew Rodger, 44, also serving life for murder.
Rose, a computer company director was jailed in 1991 for shooting dead
a grocery magnate's wife, Mrs Juliet Rowe, at her Devon home in a
bungled kidnapping attempt. Williams, a student, admitted 11 charges
which also included arson and theft. Rodger was jailed in 1987 after
killing a 54-year-old swimming pool nightwatchman with a crowbar.
Parkhurst contains murderers and terrorists. The prison also includes
a special secure unit, which operates in isolation from the rest of
Parkhurst, and was originally set up for the Great Train Robbers in the
sixties.
There was also a police security cordon around the outside of
Everthorpe Prison, North Humberside and prison officers in riot gear and
carrying perspex shields were called in after the second night of
rioting.
The trouble broke out in A and B wings just 24 hours after the first
disturbance caused thousands of pounds worth of damage on C and D wings.
Three fire engines were standing by at the jail and police dog
handlers were also in attendance. A police spokesman said: ''It was a
general riot and mayhem at the point when they were being locked up.''
Rampaging prisoners were contained in the cell unit by prison staff
and police officers contained the outer perimeter of the prison, said
the spokesman.
About 124 inmates were involved in the disturbance.
The spokesman said police and prison officers were playing a ''waiting
game'' and added: ''It could be a long night for us all.''
Last night's developments are likely to prove an embarrassment both to
Prison Service chiefs and Mr Howard, coming just days after alleged
serial killer Frederick West was found hanged in his cell.
Prison officers at Everthorpe said they had warned the governor about
staffing levels.
Almost 70 inmates were involved in the initial disturbance which began
in C wing and spilled over into D wing where prisoners had already been
locked in their cells for the night. Detective Chief Inspector Terry
Lamb, leading a police investigation into the first disturbance, said
the damage was ''horrendous''.
Mr John Bartell, general secretary for the Prison Officers'
Association, said that every time something goes wrong the Home
Secretary and the director of the prison service deny responsibility.
Mr Roy Smith, the Everthorpe prison governor, admitted that prison
officers had made representations about staffing levels and that their
position had been partly vindicated.
Meanwhile as extra police were drafted on to the Isle of Wight from
the mainland in the hunt for the men, the chairman of the board of
governors, Mr Richard Gully, said he was launching an investigation into
the escape.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman, said: ''The
ordinary prison officers who are in the front line of containing the
riot at Everthorpe know that if they get it wrong they face disciplinary
proceedings, or injury, and could lose their jobs.
''The men at the top seem to be facing no risks at all because they
take no responsibility. So many warnings have been ignored that there is
already ample reason for Michael Howard to resign and for the
director-general's contract not to be renewed.''

THE group behind the Tivoli Gardens-style proposal for the
redevelopment of the former garden festival site has claimed its plan
would give Glasgow the ''unique major tourist attraction'' which the
Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and Convention Bureau said the city badly
needs.
However, the board's chairman, Councillor Pat Lally, said the garden
scheme was not necessarily what the tourist board had in mind.
Glasgow architect Geoffrey Jarvis said his group's plans for an
international tourist attraction were much more exciting than what he
described as ''the more mundane business park developer-led proposal''
of Glasgow Development Agency.
Mr Lally, leader of Glasgow District Council, said he was ''not
terribly enthusiastic about the Tivoli Gardens concept''. He added:
''This would only last six months a year . . . what we need are things
that will contribute all year round.''
Mr Jarvis and a group of businessmen have formed Clyde Festival
Gardens 1999 Ltd, to develop an alternative to GDA's business park plan.
Mr Jarvis, an architect with William Nimmo and Partners, said the
possibility of multi-million pound Millennium Funding means the
alternative proposal is very much on the cards, especially if it is seen
to have public support.
The group is submitting its scheme to Glasgow District Council for
outline planning permission, and must pay a fee of #2900.
Mr Jarvis said that to show the Millennium Commissioners this was
something the people of Glasgow wanted, the group had asked members of
the public to send #1 to Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 Ltd, c/o 7 Fitzroy
Place, Glasgow G3 7RH. The planning application will go under the name
of ''Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 Ltd and 2899 others''.

A TEENAGER on a wildfowling trip on a Scottish river was rescued after
clinging desperately to an upturned boat for more than half-an-hour in
freezing water after the vessel capsized yesterday.
Last night, Mr Graeme Mackie, 18, thanked his friend David Pryde for
saving his life by pulling him from the icy waters of the River Tay.
The pair were on a duck-shooting expedition near Elcho Castle, Rhynd,
about four miles east of Perth.
Mr Mackie, a labourer, of Grange of Lindores, Fife, said that the boat
overturned after it struck an obstacle and went into a fast spin.
Mr Pryde, 26, of Newburgh, Fife, managed to scramble to shore, where
other members of the expedition had heard shouts from the overturned
boat.
The emergency services were called while Mr Mackie clung to the 12ft
boat.
Mr Pryde plunged back into the water, threw a rope to Mr Mackie and
pulled him and the boat ashore.
Mr Mackie said: ''I couldn't move my legs or arms because the water
was so cold and I was frozen to the boat.
''I also went under the water twice.
''We must have been about 80 yards from shore and the boat kept
drifting in and out.''
He added: ''David was frozen as well, and he acted very quickly. I owe
my life to David.''
The pair were taken by ambulance to Perth Royal Infirmary. They were
believed to be suffering from hypothermia, but were later released.
A rescue helicopter had been alerted by police after the incident, but
was cancelled just before take off.
Mr Pryde was unavailable for comment last night. A neighbour said he
was very upset about the incident.

A SECOND five-year-old girl died last night in a meningitis outbreak
which hit a village school.
The death of Alexandra Yates in London's Great Ormond Street Hospital
came as families and friends prepared for the funeral today of her best
friend, Emma Harris.
Children and parents in Rottingdean, near Brighton, already were
stunned by the Christmas tragedy which started a major health scare over
the local Church of England school.
Emma died barely 24 hours after complaining of a headache as she
opened her Christmas presents with her family.
On Boxing Day, Alexandra became seriously ill and was rushed to the
first of three hospitals which tried to save her.
Last night, Great Ormond Street Hospital confirmed she had died from
an ''extremely rare'' meningitis complication known as meningococcal
septicaemia.
As a race against time began to track down the 30 classmates of the
two girls, worried parents inundated the health authority with inquiries
and kept children at home, refusing to let them play together.
Alexandra and Emma had sung together at a carol concert a few days
before the illness struck.
A hospital spokeswoman said last night that Alexandra had been
infected by the same bacteria which caused Emma's death, but its effects
had gone beyond the area of the brain.
Meningococcal septicaemia was a form of septic shock which caused
other organs in Alexandra's body, principally her lungs, to fail.
Great Ormond Street was one of only five UK hospitals with a machine
for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo), and this enabled
Alexandra's blood to bypass her failed lungs.
''The Ecmo machine was in use from Alexandra's admission until the
time of her death, but sadly it did not save her,'' the spokeswoman
added.
Alexandra's parents, Alan and Elizabeth, spent most of the past week
at her bedside.
She had been transferred to Great Ormond Street from another London
Hospital, Guy's, where she was moved when her condition worsened after
she was admitted to a Brighton hospital.
Rottingdean School is opening on Saturday for a special counselling
session for parents who are worried about sending their children back
after the holidays.
When the 220 pupils return next week, throat swabs will be taken from
them all in an effort to find out how many were carriers of the
bacteria.
