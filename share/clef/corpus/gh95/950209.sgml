Rob Adams charts the colourful career of solo bassist Eberhard Weber,
who appears in Glasgow tonight
IT'S a universal story with endless permutations, the one about the
chap who didn't want to become a musician so instead he became a
drummer, joined Des O'Connor's backing band, etc, etc.
In Eberhard Weber's case, he didn't want to become a musician so he
became a singer with German bandleader Horst Jankowski -- he whose big
hit, the insidiously jaunty A Walk In The Black Forest, seemed to hang
in the air like midges during the 1960s. Weber can't remember for sure
if he appeared on that record but he certainly recalls singing it many
times during his 10 years with Jankowski. ''Ten years,'' he reiterates.
''That was far too long, a youthful aberration.''
He had been dissuaded from the professional musician's life by his
protective, cello-playing father, who nevertheless started his son on
cello at the age of six. In his teens Weber switched to double bass and
later played jazz in his spare time while working for a company making
television commercials. It was his sister who got him involved in the
Jankowski choir.
After his escape from choral duties he began taking jazz more
seriously. He turned professional in 1972, when he discovered his
electrobass, a customised five-string solid-bodied instrument whose
instantly recognisable sound featured on a whole string of albums for
the ECM label, including his own award-winning Colours of Chloe and the
two still very listenable Solstice albums with guitarist Ralph Towner.
For 10 years Weber led his own group, the popular Colours, but since
1982 he has been a member of saxophonist Jan Garbarek's regular touring
group. This satisfies his need to play with other musicians and allows
him time to concentrate on playing solo, which he has become more and
more interested in, not for any ego gratification purposes (''well,
maybe just a little bit''), but to see how far the instrument can go.
The idea of solo bass concerts, he readily acknowledges, can frighten
people off. ''Because it's not a recognised solo instrument you're seen
as some sort of weirdo. People think it's going to be all
art-for-art's-sake, after which everyone says 'so what'. But I try to
give them something that they will remember hours, maybe even days after
the concert. It's important that we all get pleasure from the music.''
Weber's ''the bass as orchestra'' approach is aided by technology such
as digital delay which enables him to build a composition from a simple
bassline, adding melodies, chords, rhythm patterns, whatever, as he
goes. Although there is an element of improvisation, he works to a
programme which he has evolved over 10 years and two albums, the more
recent of which, Pendulum, ranges in tone between the hauntingly
evocative and the frankly mischievous.
''I'm a little more confident about these concerts now,'' he says.
''It's a struggle to begin with because you worry if you might run out
of ideas. But through time, as the programme builds up, you get more
relaxed and the only thing I might worry about now is if something
breaks down, which is out of my control.
''I can change the programme here and there but whereas I used to
think that people wanted to hear something different every time, now I'm
not so sure. I think they mostly want to hear what they know. They want
to be surprised, also, but not too much.''
The last time Weber played solo in Scotland the surprise was how one
man and his bass, albeit technologically assisted, could hold the
attention for ninety minutes. Give them something they'll remember hours
afterwards? That last concert was five years ago and some people I know
are talking about it still.
Eberhard Weber plays City Hall, Glasgow, tonight; Queen's Hall,
Edinburgh, Friday; Music Hall, Aberdeen, Saturday.

A SCOTTISH judge was asked yesterday to decide whether a 71-year-old
widow should be allowed to visit her 15 grandchildren in this country.
Mrs Azizan Bibi was refused permission by immigration authorities to
spend a two months' holiday in Glasgow with her eldest son, Faqir
Mohammed, a licensed grocer who was sponsoring his mother's first visit
to the UK.
Mr Peter Macdonald, advocate, claimed at the Court of Session,
Edinburgh, that the decision was ''unreasonable''.
Mr Macdonald said: ''Mr Mohammed, in his evidence to the immigration
authorities, said his mother would definitely go back at the end of the
visit.''
Mr Macdonald argued that Mrs Bibi wanted to be near her late husband's
tomb and wished to die where she had spent most of her life.
The judge, Lord Kirkwood, was asked to allow Mrs Bibi's appeal, which
also has the backing of the Council of British Pakistanis (Scotland).
Miss Susan O'Brien, advocate for the Scottish Secretary, who is
opposing Mrs Bibi's appeal, will begin her case today.

THE poll comes as no surprise; it vindicates our robust defence of the
Union despite attempts by our opponents to marginalise our stance. Not
only has backing for the status quo seen a marked increase, but when the
stark realities of Labour's flawed devolution plans are exposed, there
is a dramatic drop in its support.
It is one thing to be in favour of some romantic idea of
self-determination, but quite another when the harsh practical
implications of those dreams are taken into consideration. I am quite
convinced that most sensible Scots do not wish to pay higher taxes for
the luxury of having yet more politicians and extra bureaucracy that
Labour's devolution plans would provide.
As ever, there is no clear majority for any constitutional option,
even when vague terms such as devolution are used. It is therefore wrong
to say that any sort of consensus exists for Scottish home rule. Indeed,
as the searchlight penetrates on Scotland's constitutional future, it is
more than likely that the current benefits of membership of the UK will
be more keenly appreciated.
The most interesting aspect of the poll is its confirmation that few
people regard the constitutional question as the most important issue
facing them. They are, quite rightly, more concerned about the practical
realities of life.

THIS poll is a devastating blow for the Tories, a disappointment for
the Nationalists, and a massive boost for Labour.
It shows the overwhelming demand, not only for constitutional change,
but also for Scotland to remain within the United Kingdom. While more
than three out of four Scots support some kind of Scottish Parliament,
two thirds of those polled clearly see Scotland's future as being firmly
within the UK.
It shows that Labour's plans for a Scottish Parliament inside and
strengthening the UK -- supported by 47% of Scots -- are a clear
favourite with the Scottish people. The fact that almost a third of Tory
voters support devolution shows how out of touch the Tories are with
their own voters.
The poll also demonstrates that Labour's priorities -- jobs, the NHS,
education, crime, and homelessness as well as constitutional change --
are the priorities of the people of Scotland. It shows the great
importance of the constitutional issue in determining people's vote. It
is clear the debate about Scotland's future will be one of the major
battlegrounds at the next General Election.
The clear message of this poll is that Scotland wants a real say over
its own affairs but it does not want to be wrenched out of the UK.

HOUSE prices in the Aberdeen area are continuing to outstrip the rest
of the country, and last year rose more than 3% faster than the rest of
Scotland.
They went up by 4.7% to an average of almost #71,000, while the
average Scottish price rose 1.5% to #57,700 last year and throughout the
UK the rise was 0.5% to an average of #62,750.
The annual survey, by the Aberdeen Solicitors' Property Centre and
Grampian Regional Council, shows the market is remaining buoyant
although the rate of price increase is slowing.
The highest prices of more than #100,000 were in Kingswells, Lower
Deeside, and Banchory/Durris, while the lowest prices of less than
#60,000 were in Bucksburn, Bankhead, and Stoneywood.
After suffering a drop in 1986 and 1987 in the wake of the oil price
slump, prices in the Aberdeen area have risen steadily.
They are now 13% above the UK figure, but the gap has narrowed since
1983 when the difference was 21%.
Since 1983 Aberdeen prices have risen by 90% as opposed to 103% in the
UK, and over the same period the Retail Price Index has climbed 50%.
Mr Malcolm Shepherd, ASPC vice-chairman, said: ''The rate at which
property prices in the Aberdeen area are increasing has slowed down a
little, but at almost 5% higher than a year ago the market remains in
good shape, particularly when compared with the figure for the whole of
Britain.''
During last year the ASPC handled 5690 sales in the area worth more
than #403m.
At the end of the year there were 1622 properties on its register,
which is a 41% increase on the previous year and the highest since 1989.
This reflects the fact that homes take longer to sell.

THE most interesting thing about these figures is that they have been
consistent for the last 10 years.
Over the whole period, more than three out of four Scots have wanted a
Parliament sitting in Edinburgh to make decisions about purely Scottish
matters. Half of all Scots want that Parliament to be within the United
Kingdom.
Scottish Liberal Democrats have been consistent too. Throughout this
century, we have advocated a federal system and consistently argued
against the persistent centralisation of power.
This poll also shows the people of Scotland attach great significance
to this issue. Moreover, as a Scottish Parliament would have the task of
improving our schools and health service, and a major role in creating
employment, it is quite clear the principal concerns of the Scottish
people would be addressed more effectively by the establishment of a
Scottish Parliament. The Government underestimates the demand for change
at its peril.
To the politicians, the poll spells out a simple message. The people
of Scotland want a Parliament. Both the status quo and full independence
continue to be rejected.
Now is the time for all of us in favour of change to raise the level
of debate above narrow partisan interests. And it is time for the
Conservatives to take their heads out of the sand.Jim Wallace

than #403m.
At the end of the year there were 1622 properties on its register,
which is a 41% increase on the previous year and the highest since 1989.
This reflects the fact that homes take longer to sell.

THE most interesting thing about these figures is that they have been
consistent for the last 10 years.
Over the whole period, more than three out of four Scots have wanted a
Parliament sitting in Edinburgh to make decisions about purely Scottish
matters. Half of all Scots want that Parliament to be within the United
Kingdom.
Scottish Liberal Democrats have been consistent too. Throughout this
century, we have advocated a federal system and consistently argued
against the persistent centralisation of power.
This poll also shows the people of Scotland attach great significance
to this issue. Moreover, as a Scottish Parliament would have the task of
improving our schools and health service, and a major role in creating
employment, it is quite clear the principal concerns of the Scottish
people would be addressed more effectively by the establishment of a
Scottish Parliament. The Government underestimates the demand for change
at its peril.
To the politicians, the poll spells out a simple message. The people
of Scotland want a Parliament. Both the status quo and full independence
continue to be rejected.
Now is the time for all of us in favour of change to raise the level
of debate above narrow partisan interests. And it is time for the
Conservatives to take their heads out of the sand.Jim Wallace
Scottish Liberal Democrats leader

PROPERTY consultancy Chesterton International has acquired the main
commercial arm of surveyors Bell-Ingram Ltd, a practice with offices in
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The acquisition took place on Tuesday
and makes Chesterton the only leading surveyor in Scotland with
representation in the three key cities.
The firm's staffing has now virtually doubled from its previous 65 to
125 after the takeover. Ian Darling, managing director of Bell-Ingram
becomes director in charge of the Edinburgh office; Allan Jack will
continue to run the Aberdeen office; and Neville Brown, who ran
Bell-Ingram's Glasgow office, becomes director in charge of the combined
Glasgow operation.
Chesterton's Mark Hunter retains his role as director in charge of
Scotland. The deal excludes Bell-Ingram's rural and pipelines businesses
which will continue to operate from the firm's Perth and Bonar Bridge
offices.

A NORTH-EAST developer is poised to give Aberdeen its own equivalent
of Princes Square, the up-market Glasgow specialist retail centre.
Subject to planning permission, The Academy, shown above in model, is a
50,000 sq ft retail and catering proposal with maisonettes and flats
above.
It will contain around 20 retail and catering outlets which the
developer says is not provided elsewhere in the granite city.
Charlie Ferrari, managing director of developer Jarlaw, said scheme
would have a specialist role which would complement the nearby Bon
Accord Centre, which was opened three years ago. He added: ''Aberdeen
should be on the same level as the other premier Scottish cities in
relation to speciality and quality shopping, and to date this has still
to be addressed in the city centre.''
Jarlaw has appointed Hamilton Glen, a Glasgow-based retail agency with
a track record in attracting specialist retailers into Glasgow,
Edinburgh, and Belfast. Partner Fiona Hamilton said: ''The Academy will
offer Aberdeen true 'festival shopping' of a similar quality to Princes
Square and the Italian Centre in Glasgow. Strong demand is anticipated
from internationally famous design names and other retailers at the
quality end of the market.''

AN overall 20% growth in exports by Ayrshire companies to a new high
value of #2180m is the latest statistic to mark the area's continuing
record of industrial and commercial success.
Ayrshire's all-round significance in Scotland's economic health is
being more clearly established at a time when it looks to new
challenges.
''Ayrshire, with about 7% of Scotland's population, is now producing
around 15% of Scotland's exports,'' said David Macdonald, chief
executive of Enterprise Ayrshire at their headquarters in Kilmarnock.
''Continued growth of success in the export markets is an indication of
the international competitiveness which Ayrshire companies have
achieved. This is bringing additional wealth to our national economy and
illustrates our shared vision of 'prosperity through performance'.''
Enterprise Ayrshire has just been awarded a budget of more than #28m
by Scottish Enterprise for economic development work in Ayrshire, an
increase of more than #1.8m over last year. After Glasgow, Edinburgh and
Lanarkshire it now receives the fourth largest budget within the network
of 13 Local Enterprise Companies.
To that it is also hoped to add further funds which are being sought
through the European Union and money accrued through efficiency savings
and other means, including the undertaking of joint projects with local
companies and the public sector. In all, it is believed that the
Ayrshire economy will benefit from a resultant expenditure of around
#120m in 1995-96.
''An accurate perception of modern Ayrshire has to be very different
from the past. It is now one of the most important concentrations of
manufacturing in Scotland,'' said David Macdonald. ''It is now without
doubt one of the most important exporting areas in Scotland. Take as
examples our aerospace, electronics and textiles industries -- Ayrshire
now has more people employed in textiles than there are in equivalent
Borders industries.''
Enterprise Ayrshire has been a sturdy supporter of the rebirth of
Prestwick International Airport and its new rail-link bridge. The
airport is seen as important to future plans, as is the key area of
Prestwick's aerospace industry.
''Prestwick International Airport has a main role as a freight airport
and another in handling tourist passengers. In terms of outward tourist
traffic, it will handle more passengers next year than it ever did when
it had gateway status. In terms of inbound tourists from overseas we
believe there is major growth ahead.''
One immediate factor in that inward growth is expected to be next
year's bicentenary of the death of Robert Burns. Enterprise Ayrshire
sees that commemoration as being certain to give an important stimulus
to general visitor figures. Considerable funding is being directed in
co-operation with local authorities to commemoration events across the
entire sweep of what can be regarded as Burns territory.
Ayrshire is also well advanced in its preparations for other
situations.
''One of these will be the winding up of Irvine Development
Corporation,'' said David Macdonald. ''This will certainly involve us in
additional responsibilities and although we will not be taking on all
the previous IDC functions we will certainly be involved in inward
investment delivery and are setting up an Ayrshire Business Location
Service''.
A future without Strathclyde Region is another factor where much
advanced planning is already underway. An Ayrshire Economic Forum shared
by the Region and Enterprise Ayrshire with four district authorities
will change into one shared by three single-tier authorities and the
Enterprise company.
''Our optimum position would have been a single local authority for
the whole of Ayrshire,'' said David Macdonald. ''We are disappointed
that that is not going to happen, but we are totally committed to work
with whatever new strategy is set up.''
He accepts that winding up the old and setting up the new will pose
some difficulties to continued momentum but describes relationships
within what will be the proposed new structure as already ''very
positive''.
One position which will not change is the continued belief in the
importance of improving communications within the rest of Scotland. In
Enterprise Ayrshire terms that means much more than improvements to the
A77.
''We have pretty good communications within Ayrshire. But despite this
being a very important manufacturing area it remains difficult to get in
or out of Ayrshire.''
The A77 improvement programme is claimed as a success by the Ayrshire
Economic Forum, where the regional council, district councils and
Enterprise Ayrshire came together in a joint campaign. Continuing on,
their attention is already turned to the urgent need for ''necessary
links'' to give direct access to English markets.
These links would cut across to the M74 or M6 totally avoiding the
Glasgow area, crossing on the general line of either the A70 Cumnock or
A71 Edinburgh routes.
Economic development is Enterprise Ayrshire's basic business and is
being achieved in exemplary style in partnership with local industry.
''Without doubt there is much more dynamism in the economy,'' is David
Macdonald's view. ''There is a very strong commitment between ourselves
and companies working in Ayrshire.
''Companies improving performance will not necessarily always get
bigger. But they will be stronger, and we are all working towards
that.''
A final important factor in it all is the known high quality of
workforce available. Employer feedback to Enterprise Ayrshire makes it
clear that some new companies have been drawn into the area because of
the workforce.
''In all our activities, which can involve many aspects from local
enterprise to environmental improvement, training remains one of our
biggest activities and is certainly set to continue.
''I sense an increasing appreciation and commitment to training by
employers throughout Ayrshire. Training is now seen as a real investment
by all concerned -- and that includes major employers making a major
commitment towards the continuing training of their workforce. That in
turn brings us back to the strength illustrated by the area's current
20% growth in exports and that shared vision of prosperity through
performance.''

SIR David Naish, president of the English National Farmers' Union,
performed a tricky tightrope-walking act as he strove to drive a wedge
between animal rights groups and to retain the confidence of his
membership.
If that was not enough, he used his opening address to the union's
annual meeting in London to extend the voice of reason to the broader
audience of the British public, calling for calm and reasoned debate on
the question of live animal exports.
It was clear that farmers were both angry and frightened at the
escalating violence shown by militant animal rights demonstrators,
although the Compassion in World Farming pickets outside the venue were
peaceful enough.
It was the sinister minority of ''boot boys in balaclavas'' that
attracted Sir David's wrath, along with the rent-a-quote brigade which
claimed to speak for the farming industry.
''The British people may love animals, but they cannot and will not
abide extremism and political thuggery, whatever cause it claims to
support.
''We in the NFU have been subject to taunts and cheap jibes from those
who seek publicity stunts and bluster as a substitute for thought.''
Showing that he could give as good as he got, he derided reported
plans by militants to use 100 lorries to block the M25 on a Friday
afternoon as ''an exercise in futility''. The road was usually blocked
in daylight hours from Monday to Friday anyway, he said.
He made it clear the union would continue to fight for the retention
of the legal trade to preserve a competitive farming industry in the UK.
* Meanwhile, in Brussels, Junior Agriculture Minister Angela Browning
met her Belgian counterpart as part of a tour of EU capitals to drum up
support for a ban on veal crates.
Belgium currently raises 600,000 calves a year in crates, but
Agriculture Ministry officials said farmers were moving voluntarily
towards more humane forms of production, such as group housing.
A spokesman for Minister Andre Bourgois said Belgium was in favour of
bringing forward a review of EU legislation on veal crates from 1997 to
this year, but would decide its position on a ban only on the basis of
the results of that study.
European Commission officials expect no decision on a ban when
Agriculture Ministers meet in Brussels later this month. One source said
he did not even expect to see the veterinary review completed before the
end of the year.
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler is, however, expected to push
for agreement on EU-wide animal transport rules this month. Agreement,
which will hinge on the divisive issue of maximum journey times, might
be enough to satisfy ferry companies and restore the live export trade
between Britain and the Continent.

IT was a day of in and out trading in Perth yesterday, on the third
day of the bull sales. The Simmentals were the breed under the
microscope and by general consent this was not a vintage year.
There was never any possibility of a five-figure bid to equal last
year's top of 13,000gns and, indeed, only four bulls managed to reach
the 5000gns mark.
Mr David Gaunt, the breed society secretary, commented at the
conclusion of the sale: ''It is so clear that its not enough to have
good hind quarters -- they've got to have power and length. The trade
was good for good bulls, but there were not enough of them. The message
for breeders is that they should leave short, gutty bulls at home.
No-one wants them.''
Top price was 5500gns for the fifth prize November 1993 Delfur Dominic
by Crailing Barrister from Delfur Farms, Rothes, which sold to Cumming
and Grant, Allanfearn, Inverness.
Next best was the first prize June 1993 Abbey Cowper Derwent by Sacomb
Wishful Thinking from Nora Jefferson, Abbey Cowper Farm, Carlisle, which
sold to Ouston Farms, County Durham, at 5400gns.
At 5300gns Strathisla Farms, Meigle, Perth sold the July 1993
Strathisla Dominator to M J &amp; J McLaren, Fintallich, Crieff. While at
5000gns, George Anderson, Kair, Fordoun, Kincardineshire, sold his
intermediate champion Kair Democrat to William King, Wolfstar,
Haddington.
The reserve senior champion, Innerwick Diplomat from Mr and Mrs
Lindsay, Moffat, Innerwick, Dunbar, sold at 4600gns to W R &amp; M Mill,
Westfield, Thurso. At the same price, Guy van Der Gucht from Cheltenham,
secured the first prize junior Whitemire, Drummer Boy from former NFU
vice president Mr Barclay Forrest, Whitemire, Duns.
The supreme and junior champion, the November 1993 Corrick Dollar from
Cecil McIlwaine from Newtownstewart, County Tyrone, sold at 4500gns to
Kincaple Farms, St Andrews, Fife.
At 4300gns Ardralla Estates, Islay, purchased another Northern Ireland
bull, this time from the partnership of L A Richardson and H A Stubbs,
Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh. Robert Forrest Limited, Preston, Duns,
bettered that selling at 4600gns to the Ettrickshaws Farming
Partnership, Selkirk.
Overall, 104 bulls averaged #2542 -- down #322 on 1994, when 112 were
sold. Auctioneers, United Auctions Ltd.

MANUFACTURING output has risen in all 11 UK regions over the past four
months as the recovery continues, but Scotland is lagging behind the
rest of the UK, according to the February CBI/Business Strategies
Regional Trends Survey.
It also shows that orders levelled off in Scotland over the period
leaving it again bringing up the rear. And Scotland now has the
second-highest level of firms working below capacity after the North of
England.
Scottish manufacturers, however, are reasonably optimistic about
business at present though no more so than in the October Survey. The
reason for this caution becomes more apparent when looking at the volume
of total new orders compared to October. Growth in orders, sustained for
most of 1994, has fallen back in contrast to the rest of the UK, which
is still experiencing rising total new orders.
On the upside, the outlook for orders for the next four months is more
positive with a balance of 21% -- that is the difference between those
expecting an upturn and those who do not -- looking for improvement
against 5% in October. This means expectations are at their highest
level since 1988.
Despite the fact that export orders have stabilised over the past four
months, Scottish firms expect strong increases over the next four, with
a positive balance of 15% against just 1% in October.
Figures from other sources which support the survey estimates point to
a strong export performance in the electronics, whisky, textiles and
paper industries for much of last year. As a result, firms remain
optimistic about exports over the coming year, though 67% of
manufacturers have expressed concern that creeping export prices are a
constraint on export orders.
Manufacturing output in Scotland continues to expand although the rate
of growth has dropped off a little as expected after four consecutive
quarters of moderate to strong growth. Expectations over the next four
months are for a small recovery.
The slight drop off in demand has contributed to rising stocks in
Scotland with no real shortages expected in the next four months. The
number of firms reported to be working below capacity has risen to 57%.
This suggests that investment in plant and machinery has been sufficient
to deal with present levels of demand.
Even so, plant capacity remains a short-term problem for 20% of firms.
Employment estimates implied by the survey indicate a continued
reduction in employment numbers. These fell to 338,000, representing a
2.5% reduction on the same period a year ago.
The survey shows that home market prices in Scotland, previously held
down in the face of rising costs, have risen and are expected to
continue rising in the next four months, as in the rest of the UK.
Export prices, which remained static in 1994, are starting to creep up
and expectations of future increases are, at 43%, the second highest
behind the North of England. These are still seen by firms as the
biggest constraint in winning orders. Delivery dates have become more of
a restriction, reflecting the high demand for exports. However, credit
and finance has become less of a constraint.
So far as investment is concerned, it is suggested that an
increasingly important limit on investment is uncertainty about demand.
The number of Scottish firms, though, expecting to increase capital
expenditure on plant and machinery has risen. This is in contrast falls
seen in most other areas of the UK. Of those firms indicating they were
planning to invest, just under a quarter intended to do so to expand
capacity. Replacement and increasing efficiency were other growing
factors.

HIGH Street spending around Christmas time is crucial to the fortunes
of Amstrad, the consumer electronics company founded by Alan Sugar.
Given continuing weak demand for its mature products throughout Europe
and internal restructuring within the company it is not surprising that
profitability is under pressure.
In the six months to December 31 it made a smaller-than-expected
profit of just #25,000 before tax in what has traditionally been the
stronger trading half. That compares with #1.7m previously but the
interim dividend was maintained at 1.0p.
Profits were dragged down by about #7m of stock write-downs and
rationalisation provisions which pushed continuing operations into a
loss of #8.5m. Most of the write-downs relate to Amstrad Consumer
Electronics (ACE).
Normally one would have expected Amstrad to make a loss at the
year-end on the basis of its low interim profitability but Mr Sugar said
that the nature of Amstrad's business had changed to such an extent that
''seasonal factors are not as significant''. He added that the half-year
position should be maintained in the second half.
Of more importance to the future is the progress made by David Rogers,
the new chief executive, in reshaping the group's business. ACE is said
to have improved its trading performance recently helped by the
establishment last November of a direct selling operation. Amstrad
Direct sells faxes and computer direct to consumers. The benefits of
restructuring ACE under new management are expected to be felt next
year.
Two recent acquisitions are making encouraging progress. Viglen, the
personal computer manufacturer, made a profit of #5m. Its production
capacity will increase with the opening of a new factory.
The company's policy of taking an immediate write-down against
reserves of goodwill arising from the Viglen acquisition led a reduction
in Amstrad's net asset value. Net current assets dropped to #177.8m from
#228.1m.
Dancall Telecom, the telecoms equipment manufacturer, is said to be
making money. Later this year Dancall is to launch its new digital
cellular telephone.
Also on the positive side the group's balance sheet was strong with
net interest of #2.7m on its #136.4m cash pile.
Many in the City believe that Anstrad has turned the corner and can
look forward to a brighter future. The strong cash position together
with analysts forecasts for profits of #15m-#20m in 1996 helped Amstrad
shares gain 8p to 141p.

A ROW is brewing between BT and its regulator, Don Cruickshank,
director-general of Oftel, over amendments it has proposed to BT's
licence.
They concern the way BT works out how much to charge other operators
such as Mercury for using its telephone lines. This is a bone of
contention for Mercury whose interconnect fees are set to double to #60m
in 1994/95.
Mr Cruickshank is proposing that BT should produce regulatory accounts
and cost break-downs, and that Oftel should have more power to
investigate BT's accounting procedures and cross-subsidies.
BT said it accepted the principle of accounting separation proposed by
Oftel and would respond on the public record within the next week or so.
A new interconnect regime would be in place from April 1.
However, the group accused Oftel of wanting ''unfettered discretionary
powers'' which went far beyond what was required to achieve accounting
separation.
''Wide discretionary powers, by their nature, introduce uncertainty
and unpredictability into the regulatory regime. This is not in the
interest of customers, shareholders or competitors,'' it said.

THE Scottish American Investment Company's net asset value was dented
for only the second time in two decades last year.
Saints' nav fell 9% to 171.4p during the year to end-December,
slightly outperforming the FTSE-A All-Share Index, which lost 9.6%. A
further 3% decline in nav was suffered during January, with Far Eastern
markets on the slide.
Saints is proposing a final dividend of 1.22p, resulting in a 4.1%
increase in total dividend to 4.82p.
The #383m investment trust had 50% of its portfolio in UK equities at
the year-end, with 8% in North America, 9% in Continental Europe, 6% in
Japan, 13% in emerging markets in the Far East and Latin America, 2% in
unquoted companies, and 12% in fixed interest investments.
Latin American investments were the poorest performers but, with only
2.5% of funds invested there, Saints was cushioned from the full extent
of the financial crisis which began late last year.
Teddy Tulloch of manager Stewart Ivory said: ''It is sad to give some
money back but at least it has not been a disaster. I think, after the
strong gains of the last three years, it is not surprising to give some
of it back.''
Saints' 1994 performance is in stark contrast to the previous year,
when its nav rose 24% to 188.3p.
The company sees good value in the bond markets and believes a firmer
Wall Street will lend support to equities in the UK and Continental
Europe.
It anticipates that Pacific markets such as Singapore and Malaysia
will offer excellent buying opportunities from the beginning of next
month.
Although the Kobe earthquake appears to have temporarily put paid to a
recovery in the Japanese stock market, Mr Tulloch foresees a rally
before or during the second half of the year.
Looking ahead generally, he said: ''I think there will be a pick-up
but I think there will also be some anxious moments to cope with.''
Uncertainties in the UK in the run-up to the next general election, a
possible leadership crisis in China, and concerns over further US
interest rate rises are among the possible causes of future volatility.
With the company reiterating its policy of minimum consecutive rises
of 0.01p in quarterly dividends, the total 1995 payout should be at
least 4.98p.

Philip Contini, boss
of Edinburgh's famous
specialist food shop
Valvona and Crolla,
claims you don't get
seriously rich from a deli.
But V and C is rich in
tradition, discerning
customers, and admirers
(below) whose prestige
is matched only by the
title they recently
bestowed on the shop,
says Raymond Duncan.
LLOYD Grossman and his fellow judges -- including Sir Peter Ustinov,
Lord Lichfield and Sir David Frost -- ''deliberated, cogitated, and
digested'' and at the end of the day came up with their choice of the
UK's Best Specialist Food Shop.
The category, one of several in the recent Courvoisier Book of the
Best Awards, was won by a family business launched more than a century
ago and which has mushroomed into one of Scotland's best-known food and
wine operations.
When, in the 1870s, Ralph Valvona began importing food from Italy into
the Edinburgh area to supply the growing number of Italian immigrants he
could never have imagined the success ahead.
Valvona and Crolla Ltd, in Edinburgh's Elm Row, often featured in food
and drink television programmes and chosen by top name cooks such as
Antonio Carluccio and Sophie Grigson as a venue for cookery
demonstrations and book launches, has been described by Grossman as
''the front rank of specialist food retailers''.
The name resulted from the setting up of a partnership in the 1920s
between Valvona and Alfonso Crolla, grandfather of the current
generation running the business. On September 8, 1934, the company was
incorporated.
It grew steadily, although the war brought an obvious blip and the
real growth came in the late 40s and 50s with Alfonso's son Victor in
charge.
As well as starting a delivery service of all its produce to Italian
families the length and breadth of Scotland, he also started the
''education'' of the Scots in things Italian including wines, oils,
vinegars and cheeses.
Carlo Contini, father of the current management, married into the
family business in the early 50s.
The job of taking the delicatessen, formerly a fish and chip shop,
into the twenty-first century has now fallen to 41-year-old managing
director Philip Contini;, his younger brother Victor, a director and
fresh food buyer; and Philip's wife Maria, administrator and events
director. Carlo Contini is company chairman.
A computerised system is being set up for the business which employs
around 40 full-time and part-time staff.
Those who control the operation are ambitious but not to the extent of
opening a series of nationwide delicatessens.
''Ideally it would be brilliant if we could have Valvona and Crolla in
every city centre in Britain to give everybody the opportunity to taste
what we think is good,'' says Philip. ''That would be fantastic but
maybe I'm not the person to do it. Perhaps it has to be the next
generation who might take it on.''
He and Maria have a teenage daughter Francesca but at present she has
no inclination to join the business and no pressure will be put on her.
Philip, unlike Victor, didn't want to join the business as a teenager.
He was waiting to be accepted for a sociology degree at Stirling
University and only helped the family out on a Saturday.
''They were clever,'' says Philip. ''My Dad suggested I work during
the summer. The idea was to get me into the business and it worked. They
gave me a car used for deliveries, put my wages up and gave me
responsibility. I thought this was great. I was hooked.''
There came a time when Valvona and Crolla had to decide the direction
it was to take. Management could have bought new premises and
established a large Italian supermarket. Or it could specialise.
''I felt we could not compete with the supermarkets and that has been
borne out today with the big outflow of city stores mopping up all the
business and leading to the demise of the small local ones dotted round
the city.
''We buy from small producers and growers, family people like
ourselves. Supermarkets can't compete with that because these small
people can't give them the volumes they need.
''We have the exclusivity of high-standard products and we give value
for money.''
There is a fast refrigerated delivery service from Milan to Edinburgh.
For example, their ''real'' Mozzarella di Bufala is produced in Naples
on a Thursday and is on the Elm Row counter by Tuesday morning.
The management is currently examining the possibility of opening a
small restaurant for customers at the back of the delicatessen where
they could introduce new food lines.
It also wants to introduce a mail-order service for food, as it does
with wine.
Business is going well for Valvona and Crolla, although Hibs fan
Philip, who admits it provides a good life for them, maintains that
''you don't get seriously rich opening a deli. I tell people who want
advice about starting one -- open a fish and chip shop if you really
want to make money!''

LLOYDS Abbey Life's decision to increase its provisions against
compensation liabilities for the possible mis-selling of personal
pensions by #59.6m to #80.1m should give all those who have invested in
endowment and other profits related policies something to ponder.
The life industry as a whole could face claims of about #2000m over
the next two or three years, depending on the response to a letter which
the Securities and Investments Board should be sending out in about six
weeks once the wording has been agreed with the life companies.
Lloyds Abbey Life has about 5% of the sector, but chief executive
Stephen Maran reckons it will have a proportionately lower exposure to
claims as it had predominantly sold pensions to younger people through
its Abbey Life and Black Horse Life divisions.
He said yesterday that all the costs would go against shareholders as
the policies were unit-linked and had no bonuses which could be cut in
the future. So the pain is rightly being shouldered entirely by the
company and not by unit holders.
That is in stark contrast with the bonus system at the mutuals where
future bonuses will have to take all the strain.
And as during the last three or four years terminal bonuses, in
particular, have been reduced, the outlook on that score seems even
bleaker. Endowment holders with some mutuals, who will be suffering
because of management failure, are likely to feel somewhat sore when the
bonus announcements are made early next year in respect of 1995 results.
But in practice, they are virtually powerless to seek retribution.
As a result of these increased provisions, Lloyds Abbey Life saw 1994
pre-tax profits ease 2% to #316m, with Black Horse Financial Services
the worst hit, declining by 41% to #67.6m. That reflected single and
regular premiums business falling by 37% and 19% respectively, even
though there was a slight bounce in singles activity in the fourth
quarter.
Part of the downturn was due to the amount of time and expense
involved in re-training.
Chairman Sir Simon Hornby argued that the setback was in fact due to
hostile criticism of the industry. ''Family finance people have got to
stop. Not all life assurance salesmen are crooks,'' he said.
However, the question of whether Black Horse will be sold, as has been
rumoured, was met with silence. So was that concerning the Lloyds Bank
parent, which has a 62% holding, doing a bit of tidying up.
Sir Simon added there was a danger that over-regulation combined with
press comment might stop people protecting themselves, with many now
under-insured.
Disclosure of commission has also thrown many customers into
confusion, with the actual investment performance much more important at
the end of the day.
It will take time to restore confidence, with the trend by the
building societies to push repayment mortgages one major hurdle to
overcome. After all, if the Halifax is prepared to forego commission on
life policies, it must have good reason.
There were, however, one or two bright spots, with the Lloyds Bank
Insurance activities benefiting from selling credit insurance for those
taking out loans. Bowmaker saw its contribution jump 92% to #73.2m
helped by the surge in new car registrations in 1994, but Mr Maran is a
little less confident about current trading conditions. Likewise, the
housing market is ''pretty awful''. The estate agency business remained
in a small loss.
Germany continues as something of a disaster area, with Trans Leben
seeing losses only slightly reduced to #13.5m, although half of this
deficit relates to the write-down of the investment portfolio under
German regulations.
Mr Maran would dearly like to sell the activity, but buyers are
conspicuous by their absence.
Although there is some encouragement from a raised dividend total, up
1.5p to 19.5p for a yield of 6.8%, it is not sufficient support for the
shares at 356p -- that comes only from hopes that Lloyds will move to
buy out minority shareholders once it has completed the #1800m
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester acquisition.

PEOPLE in the UK are living longer these days through a combination of
better quality of life and advances in medical science. What has yet to
be addressed is where this increasing number of old people are to live
when they become incapable of looking after themselves and can no longer
be cared for in their own homes.
The answer lies in private nursing homes. Although there are many
thousands there are insufficient of the quality needed to meet projected
demand.
Increasingly, following the introduction of Care in the Community,
local authorities are preferring to place old people in purpose-built
nursing homes. These are typically owned and run by large operators such
as Takare and Westminster Nursing Homes.
Independent consultant Laing &amp; Buisson estimates that between mid-1994
and mid-2000, about 100,000 new and replacement care home beds will be
required. Estimates of the total capital expenditure needed by the
quoted nursing home operators in this six-year period centre around
#3000m, assuming a capital cost per bed of #30,000. In Scotland this is
nearer to #25,000.
One company which intends to plug a least some of the funding gap is
Nursing Home Properties (NHP). It is a property investment company
specialising in the sale and leaseback of purpose-built nursing homes,
the first of its kind in the UK. It is currently offering the public 15
million Ordinary Shares at 100p each to raise up to #30m, in what chief
executive Richard Ellert said was a low-risk property asset-backed
investment.
''NHP is the ideal vehicle for the risk averse investor seeking a high
and growing level of income together with good prospects for capital
growth,'' he said.
Investment in NHP will allow private investors to participate from the
outset in the growth of nursing homes as a new sector of commercial
property. The NHP prospectus shows a projected gross dividend yield for
the first full year of 7.4%, which is expected to rise thereafter.
The public offer follows a similar sized institutional offer,
completed last week, that was oversubscribed. The Bank of Scotland was
among those taking an equity stake in NHP. It is also one of the
institutions providing it with a banking facility.
Mr Ellert believes it makes commercial sense for the ownership and
management of nursing homes to be split in a similar fashion to that
which occurs in the retail industry. NHP intends to limit its
geographical and home occupancy risk through securitisation. This is a
method of debt financing where securities are issued secured on
identified assets of a company, in this case nursing homes.
This will provide NHP with additional funding at lower cost than is
available from its existing banking arrangements.
It will only take on nursing home tenants if they have proven ability,
reputation and track record, and a minimum of 300 beds in operation.
There will be a minimum base level of rent, linked to turnover, which
will be reset every five years on an upward basis only.
NHP has already entered into conditional arrangements with four
nursing home operators, including Ashbourne and Grampian Care, to
acquire #45.3m of nursing home assets. Deals are due to be completed on
the Forfar and Arbroath Grampian nursing homes early next month.
The NHP offer closes on Tuesday 28 February. There is a minimum
investment of #1000 and dividends will be paid twice yearly. The issue
is sponsored by Close Brothers and Collins Stewart is the stockbroker.
Share dealings are expected to be permitted under rule 4.2 on March 31.
The rule 4.2 facility is to be followed by a listing as soon as
possible.

BATH Press Group, founded by Sir Isaac Pitman in 1845 and now one of
Britain's largest book manufacturers, printing around 27 million volumes
a year, is going public. This takes the form of a reverse into Diverse
Acquisitions, a special vehicle formed by Luke Johnson, Hugh Osmond and
Matthew Allen, responsible for floating Pizza Express.
The enlarged group will be valued at #13.2m at the 10p placing and
rights price, following a #10.5m fund raising.
Bath Press Group, whose coloured art books are printed at the
company's Blantyre plant, specialises in high quality books and cites
Margaret Thatcher's Downing Street Years, Andrew Morton's Diana -- Her
True Story and David Attenborough's The Private Life of Plants as three
examples. It won the Book Printing Company of the Year award in 1994.
For the 34 weeks to November 25 adjusted profits before interest and
tax amounted to #1.92m.
Bath Press Group's chief executive Roy Hill commented: ''Going public
means Bath Press has the financial strength to take advantage of the
significant expansion opportunities in the book manufacturing market.''
Mr Hill will be retaining a 9.3% shareholding in the enlarged group.
The shares commence trading on Monday, February 13. The sponsor and
underwriter to the issue is Hill Samuel Bank and the stockbroker is
Albert E Sharp.

BRITISH Petroleum and Graseby have won the 1995 Annual Account Awards,
presented to one large and one small company for the excellence of their
financial reporting and disclosure.
Both companies provided good descriptions of their business. This was
particularly important for Graseby as Britain's largest supplier of
automated drug doseage to patients and pollution detection equipment.
Other factors included full director information, divisional performance
with headlines to encourage the reader to press on, and full financial
ratios.
The judging panel, headed on behalf of the Stock Exchange and the
three institutes of chartered accountants by solicitor Richard Sykes,
had to consider the accounts all 2200 listed companies, although that
figure was soon reduced to 140 or so for closer inspection.
He said the small companies -- with shareholder funds of under #50m --
had shown a significant improvement, partly because they were feeling
more confident and were prepared to spend more on their annual accounts.
Accounts must be addressed to various sets of audiences with different
objectives and be understandable.
One very major company which provided a wealth of information
presented itin an indigestible form because it was computer sourced.
Although not named, this is believed to be British Gas.
Mr Sykes said that as directors' pay was the hot potato of the moment,
he expected much more disclosure in accounts being filed in the current
year.
The winners last year were Coats Viyella and James Cropper.

NORTHERN Electric shares jumped ahead 19p to 978p as expectations grew
that President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine may not refer the
hostile #1200m bid from Trafalgar House to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
An announcement to this effect could come today at 11am as decisions
of this type are increasingly announced either on Tuesday or Thursday
mornings.
Even if there is a referral, most analysts expect that the offer will
be allowed to proceed although perhaps encumbered by one or two
conditions. These could include measures to safeguard future capital
expenditure.
The war of words continued with Northern attempting to undermine
Trafalgar's prospects and claiming that it does not understand the
electricity distribution business. But the real battle obviously will
not begin, if it starts at all, until Mr Heseltine's position is made
public.
The George Soros Quantum Fund has sold its holding of 1.485 million
shares at 963p and so has lost #620,000 on the deal. The $11bn fund
started buying Northern shares just after the bid was announced on
December 19.
Mr Soros sprang into the limelight as one the major players resposible
for Britain leaving the ERM in September 1992 after selling sterling
short.

A ROW is brewing between BT and its regulator, Don Cruickshank,
director-general of Oftel, over amendments it has proposed to BT's
licence.
They concern the way BT works out how much to charge other operators
such as Mercury for using its telephone lines. This is a bone of
contention for Mercury whose interconnect fees are set to double to #60m
in 1994/95.
Mr Cruickshank is proposing that BT should produce regulatory accounts
and cost break-downs, and that Oftel should have more power to
investigate BT's accounting procedures and cross-subsidies.
BT said it accepted the principle of accounting separation proposed by
Oftel and would respond on the public record within the next week or so.
A new interconnect regime would be in place from April 1.
However, the group accused Oftel of wanting ''unfettered discretionary
powers'' which went far beyond what was required to achieve accounting
separation.
''Wide discretionary powers, by their nature, introduce uncertainty
and unpredictability into the regulatory regime. This is not in the
interest of customers, shareholders or competitors,'' it said.

THE Scottish American Investment Company's net asset value was dented
for only the second time in two decades last year.
Saints' nav fell 9% to 171.4p during the year to end-December,
slightly outperforming the FTSE-A All-Share Index, which lost 9.6%. A
further 3% decline in nav was suffered during January, with Far Eastern
markets on the slide.
Saints is proposing a final dividend of 1.22p, resulting in a 4.1%
increase in total dividend to 4.82p.
The #383m investment trust had 50% of its portfolio in UK equities at
the year-end, with 8% in North America, 9% in Continental Europe, 6% in
Japan, 13% in emerging markets in the Far East and Latin America, 2% in
unquoted companies, and 12% in fixed interest investments.
Latin American investments were the poorest performers but, with only
2.5% of funds invested there, Saints was cushioned from the full extent
of the financial crisis which began late last year.
Teddy Tulloch of manager Stewart Ivory said: ''It is sad to give some
money back but at least it has not been a disaster. I think, after the
strong gains of the last three years, it is not surprising to give some
of it back.''
Saints' 1994 performance is in stark contrast to the previous year,
when its nav rose 24% to 188.3p.
The company sees good value in the bond markets and believes a firmer
Wall Street will lend support to equities in the UK and Continental
Europe.
It anticipates that Pacific markets such as Singapore and Malaysia
will offer excellent buying opportunities from the beginning of next
month.
Although the Kobe earthquake appears to have temporarily put paid to a
recovery in the Japanese stock market, Mr Tulloch foresees a rally
before or during the second half of the year.
Looking ahead generally, he said: ''I think there will be a pick-up
but I think there will also be some anxious moments to cope with.''
Uncertainties in the UK in the run-up to the next general election, a
possible leadership crisis in China, and concerns over further US
interest rate rises are among the possible causes of future volatility.
With the company reiterating its policy of minimum consecutive rises
of 0.01p in quarterly dividends, the total 1995 payout should be at
least 4.98p.

JANUARY brought a healthy improvement in trading activity in both the
domestic and foreign equity markets, according to the London Stock
Exchange's January Fact Sheet.
On the domestic market, turnover last month was #49.4bn, an 18%
increase on the previous month. The overseas market also posted an
increase of 22% on December to #54.7bn.
Although both domestic and foreign turnover was down on January 1994's
particularly buoyant figures, trading has picked up from the depressed
levels which characterised the latter months of the year.

Businessman Alan Armstrong gives his report on a conference on
monetary and economic reform which he attended in Toronto
DURING the last few days of January I attended an extraordinary
economic conference in Toronto and your readers, I hope, may be
interested in what participants had to say.
They discussed the distressing impact of a world economy in
depression. They noted the real prospect of its impending ''meltdown''
on a scale that will make the depression of the 1930s seem like a minor
downturn in the economic cycle. And they went on to identify clearly the
root causes and what change must precede any satisfactory solution.
All of us are familiar with the symptoms of the problem -- poverty
amidst plenty, mass unemployment, increasing homelessness, rising public
and private debt, diminishing social cohesion and a desperately ailing
environment.
Less of us are aware of what is causing the problem.
We find it difficult to understand why it is that our governments
everywhere, and of every shade of political persuasion, insist in
concert that nothing can be done until ''the budget deficit'' has been
eliminated.
We may also find it strange that their only approach to dealing with
these deficits is by a combination of rising interest rates, swinging
cuts in public services and/or increased taxation and then reliance on
''free markets'' to deliver recovery.
Well, around the world there is a growing awareness of what the root
cause of the economic problem is (I'll identify it later in this letter)
and there is growing opposition to the uniform, centrally orchestrated
and increasingly unacceptable approach that governments and
international financial institutions are bringing to its ''solution''.
Perhaps nowhere is this awareness and opposition being more effectively
channelled than in Canada -- thanks to COMER.
The Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform was founded in 1986 by a
number of eminent figures in the fields of economics, accountancy,
mathematics and private business. It held its first conference that year
and launched its ''Economic Reform'' newsletter in 1986.
The committee set out to convince politicians and thoughtful members
of their professions that the current approach to operation of the
economy was fatally flawed and that it simply must lead to a crisis of
no less severity than that of the 1930s.
Gradually COMER has become very influential, forcing the political,
economic and financial establishments to respod to their arguments.
Membership has grown steadily and the 1995 conference was designed to
broaden the campaign base still further, by inviting a wide range of
organisations representing sectors adversely affected by the economic
downturn, to become active in the call for change on the basis of the
COMER programme.
In fact over 200 participants from a very wide range of organisations
in Canada, the US, and Scotland took part.
The conference agenda, which ran from the evening of Friday, January
27 to Sunday afternoon on the 29th, included a major presentation by the
Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation.
The presentation demonstrated, that whereas the implication behind
''bringing the deficit under control'' was always that Canadians were
''living beyond their means'' and that this profligacy was responsible
for the social problems that plagued Canadian society, the fact was that
close analysis of the deficit showed that:
* Fifty per cent was accounted for by massive tax breaks for big
business (a recent TV programme had noted that a girl working as a
teller with the Royal Bank of Canada had payed more tax than the bank!).
* Forty-four per cent was due to high interest payments to holders of
the national debt while the Bank of Canada was deliberately following a
high interest rate policy ostensibly to ''squeeze inflation from the
system''.
* Six per cent was accounted for by government spending on public
services.
This presentation was followed on Saturday by a plenary session
dealing with the background to the problem and the unworkability of
''presently touted solutions''.
It covered the role of the Bank of Canada which in its early years of
operation had been a powerful force for good while its policies today --
aligned with those of other Central Banks and co-ordinated from the Bank
of International Settlements -- were an unmitigated disaster.
It dealt with misunderstandings about the nature of inflation that
central banks and governments have beeen instructed to set such store by
when pursuing their monetary policy.
It is far from being simply an indication of the ''economy
overheating'' because of excess demand.
In conditions of mass unemployment that should be obvious!
A rising price index may instead reflect the impact on prices of
rising interest rates which business must recover in prices, the cost of
anti-pollution measures etc etc, while the economy is in fact operating
at well below its full employment potential.
Policies of restraint then, simply make the situation worse rather
than better.
This session was completed with a review of international financial
institutions -- IMF, World Bank, and Bank of International Settlements
-- and their global co-ordination and development of, monetary policies,
free market economics involving free international movement of capital
and trading blocks etc.
Most of the rest of Saturday was taken up by workshops dealing with
the ''ABC'' of money -- especially, and this is the nub of the problem:
how it is created ''out of nothing'' by the commercial banks everywhere,
on the basis of the ''reserve ratio'' or ''fractional reserve'' system.
It is a fact that private banks in this way, create some 95% of the
nation's money supply which they inject into the economy only in the
form of interest-bearing debt and which they subsequently cancel out of
existence when the loans are repaid. The result is continuously growing
indebtedness of national and local governments, business, and consumers.
This fractional reserve/debt money system which the whole world uses
is simply unsustainable.
''With present institutions, prosperity, growth, and ecological
viability are not sustainable in the long run because of excessive
growth of debt and interest on debt.
''Through the last century at least the following pattern has
manifested itself: real output only grows in years in which aggregate
demand grows, demand only grows when the money supply grows, the money
supply only grows when debt grows.
''The longer output, demand, money supply and debt grows the higher
the rate of interest becomes and the more excessive the growth of
interest and debt.
''This pattern presents itself internationally as well as nationally,
as unpayable Third World interest which must be either added to
unpayable Third World debt in ever greater resort to ''Ponzi finance''
or the leading banks of the world must be declared insolvent.''
Ana Isla, a Peruvian economist, spoke in this context of the debt
crisis in Latin America where the debt burden had ''brought Latin
American countries into submission, perpetuating a process of capital
flight, impoverishment and environmental destruction''. . . ''The only
way for Andean countries (Bolivia, Peru, Colombia) to survive is by
growing coca (source of cocaine) as a ''cash crop''.
Perhaps the speed with which President Clinton acted to circumvent
Congress and arrange, in co-operation with the IMF and Bank of
International Settlements, a $47.5bn Mexican bail-out can more easily be
understood in this context.
Sunday was wholly taken up with the workshops, this time instead of
dealing with the problem, the focus was on solutions and action to
ensure their implementation.
A large number of initiatives were brought back to the final plenary
session and were recommended for action by COMER and other organisations
represented at the conference.
The conference was quite clearly a huge success.
Campaigning for monetary reform will now be much more broadly based
and co-ordinated action will proceed in both Canada and the US.
It will reflect a unanimous acceptance that the key reform must
involve, in Canada, restoring to the Bank of Canada the responsibility,
enshrined in its constitution, of creating either debt free or at zero
or very low interest, all or nearly all of the money supply in the
Canadian economy.
When this is achieved it will simply be a return to the arrangement
under which the bank, between its establishment in 1934 and 1945,
created 80% of all transactions money (notes, coins and demand deposits)
and during the Second World War financed all government deficits above
25% of GNP at interest rates of between 0.37% and 2% while inflation was
prevented through wage, price and credit controls.
Given that the ''monetary experiment'', currently followed by the
governments of all major economies, with precisely the same results, has
been centrally imposed and co-ordinated by the international financial
interests, through the Bank of International Settlements, it is
important that any campaign for change should also be international and
the COMER initiative is an important start to that process.
The alternative to radical monetary change along these lines is
inevitable progress to the threatened ''meltdown'' of the international
financial and economic system with which I opened this letter from
Canada.

Hugh Dougherty discovers how one man is building himself a business by
helping builders build theirs.
JIM BONNER is building up his own business. And he's building up the
building industry at the same time. The 43-year-old man behind JB is
drawing on nearly a quarter of a century of experience as a surveyor,
contracts manager and quality guru, to help the small and medium-size
builder cope with a world in which paperwork, professionally prepared
and submitted, counts for as much in winning and keeping contract
customers as site-based skills.
''What I'm here to do is improve the image of the smaller man by
making it possible for him to access the full range of surveying and
contracts administration services,'' explained Jim, who works from home.
''Far too many smaller operators in the building business try to do
everything themselves. The picture comes to mind of a man who's been out
on sites, working with his men all day, sitting at home in the evening,
making very little progress with a calculator, forms and contract
documents,'' said Jim. ''These businesses can't afford to have that sort
of provision in-house, but as I operate on the basis of a percentage of
contract fee, they can afford me.''
Jim drew on his own experience working for large builders. But, as he
says, the problems faced by the smaller concern can be just as complex.
One of his customers turns over #2m and employs 80 men, mostly on
cable television cable-laying contract work.
''That's the sort of business that needs a professional eye, with
surveying and contracts administration background, cast over its
operations,'' said Jim. ''The smaller and medium-size builder may handle
substantial amounts of money and employ a considerable number of staff.
But he has to relate to a variety of organisations including banks,
contract customers and suppliers. They all want to see professional
paperwork and presentation. I feel that far too many smaller builders
sell themselves short on image. I want to raise it for the whole
industry.''
But Jim also knows that his prime market won't react too well to
someone who is offering a service with frills.
''That's why JB operates from home to keep overheads down. My
customers want the basics and the basics done very well. Years of being
on site as a surveyor and contracts administrator means that I can
relate to the people counting the actual bricks and employing the
joiners at the very sharp end. Sometimes I think that counts for just as
much as being a chartered surveyor and a Member of the Chartered
Institute of Builders,'' said Jim.
JB regards systems, and the pursuit of quality, as the lifeline to the
many small builders who go under.
''Far too many builders go to the wall,'' said Jim. ''The truth is
that customers are very keen to have faith in a builder. That's where
the professional approach to documentation and keeping track of
contracts is vital.''
But Jim makes no bones about why he's gone down the road of keeping
the building industry on the level in viability terms.
''The large company I was with went bankrupt, and I was forced to
consider my own position,'' said Jim. ''But I had always maintained that
I had spotted a gap in the market, and that's exactly where I've founded
my own business.''
And does the man behind JB practice what he preaches to his own
industry?
''Of course,'' he smiled. ''I've taken training in computing, kept up
my professional studies, and employ an accountant to do my own books. I
wouldn't attempt anything that I couldn't do in business terms myself.
There's no reason why a builder should be good at contract management
and systems. If he sticks to his concrete, bricks, men and plant and
hands the rest over to me, we'll all build up our businesses. And the
Scottish building industry will begin to get a better image. That can
only be good for builders, the folk they employ, and their customers --
not to mention JB itself.''

Businessman Alan Armstrong gives his report on a conference on
monetary and economic reform which he attended in Toronto
DURING the last few days of January I attended an extraordinary
economic conference in Toronto and your readers, I hope, may be
interested in what participants had to say.
They discussed the distressing impact of a world economy in
depression. They noted the real prospect of its impending ''meltdown''
on a scale that will make the depression of the 1930s seem like a minor
downturn in the economic cycle. And they went on to identify clearly the
root causes and what change must precede any satisfactory solution.
All of us are familiar with the symptoms of the problem -- poverty
amidst plenty, mass unemployment, increasing homelessness, rising public
and private debt, diminishing social cohesion and a desperately ailing
environment.
Less of us are aware of what is causing the problem.
We find it difficult to understand why it is that our governments
everywhere, and of every shade of political persuasion, insist in
concert that nothing can be done until ''the budget deficit'' has been
eliminated.
We may also find it strange that their only approach to dealing with
these deficits is by a combination of rising interest rates, swinging
cuts in public services and/or increased taxation and then reliance on
''free markets'' to deliver recovery.
Well, around the world there is a growing awareness of what the root
cause of the economic problem is (I'll identify it later in this letter)
and there is growing opposition to the uniform, centrally orchestrated
and increasingly unacceptable approach that governments and
international financial institutions are bringing to its ''solution''.
Perhaps nowhere is this awareness and opposition being more effectively
channelled than in Canada -- thanks to COMER.
The Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform was founded in 1986 by a
number of eminent figures in the fields of economics, accountancy,
mathematics and private business. It held its first conference that year
and launched its ''Economic Reform'' newsletter in 1986.
The committee set out to convince politicians and thoughtful members
of their professions that the current approach to operation of the
economy was fatally flawed and that it simply must lead to a crisis of
no less severity than that of the 1930s.
Gradually COMER has become very influential, forcing the political,
economic and financial establishments to respod to their arguments.
Membership has grown steadily and the 1995 conference was designed to
broaden the campaign base still further, by inviting a wide range of
organisations representing sectors adversely affected by the economic
downturn, to become active in the call for change on the basis of the
COMER programme.
In fact over 200 participants from a very wide range of organisations
in Canada, the US, and Scotland took part.
The conference agenda, which ran from the evening of Friday, January
27 to Sunday afternoon on the 29th, included a major presentation by the
Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation.
The presentation demonstrated, that whereas the implication behind
''bringing the deficit under control'' was always that Canadians were
''living beyond their means'' and that this profligacy was responsible
for the social problems that plagued Canadian society, the fact was that
close analysis of the deficit showed that:
* Fifty per cent was accounted for by massive tax breaks for big
business (a recent TV programme had noted that a girl working as a
teller with the Royal Bank of Canada had payed more tax than the bank!).
* Forty-four per cent was due to high interest payments to holders of
the national debt while the Bank of Canada was deliberately following a
high interest rate policy ostensibly to ''squeeze inflation from the
system''.
* Six per cent was accounted for by government spending on public
services.
This presentation was followed on Saturday by a plenary session
dealing with the background to the problem and the unworkability of
''presently touted solutions''.
It covered the role of the Bank of Canada which in its early years of
operation had been a powerful force for good while its policies today --
aligned with those of other Central Banks and co-ordinated from the Bank
of International Settlements -- were an unmitigated disaster.
It dealt with misunderstandings about the nature of inflation that
central banks and governments have beeen instructed to set such store by
when pursuing their monetary policy.
It is far from being simply an indication of the ''economy
overheating'' because of excess demand.
In conditions of mass unemployment that should be obvious!
A rising price index may instead reflect the impact on prices of
rising interest rates which business must recover in prices, the cost of
anti-pollution measures etc etc, while the economy is in fact operating
at well below its full employment potential.
Policies of restraint then, simply make the situation worse rather
than better.
This session was completed with a review of international financial
institutions -- IMF, World Bank, and Bank of International Settlements
-- and their global co-ordination and development of, monetary policies,
free market economics involving free international movement of capital
and trading blocks etc.
Most of the rest of Saturday was taken up by workshops dealing with
the ''ABC'' of money -- especially, and this is the nub of the problem:
how it is created ''out of nothing'' by the commercial banks everywhere,
on the basis of the ''reserve ratio'' or ''fractional reserve'' system.
It is a fact that private banks in this way, create some 95% of the
nation's money supply which they inject into the economy only in the
form of interest-bearing debt and which they subsequently cancel out of
existence when the loans are repaid. The result is continuously growing
indebtedness of national and local governments, business, and consumers.
This fractional reserve/debt money system which the whole world uses
is simply unsustainable.
''With present institutions, prosperity, growth, and ecological
viability are not sustainable in the long run because of excessive
growth of debt and interest on debt.
''Through the last century at least the following pattern has
manifested itself: real output only grows in years in which aggregate
demand grows, demand only grows when the money supply grows, the money
supply only grows when debt grows.
''The longer output, demand, money supply and debt grows the higher
the rate of interest becomes and the more excessive the growth of
interest and debt.
''This pattern presents itself internationally as well as nationally,
as unpayable Third World interest which must be either added to
unpayable Third World debt in ever greater resort to ''Ponzi finance''
or the leading banks of the world must be declared insolvent.''
Ana Isla, a Peruvian economist, spoke in this context of the debt
crisis in Latin America where the debt burden had ''brought Latin
American countries into submission, perpetuating a process of capital
flight, impoverishment and environmental destruction''. . . ''The only
way for Andean countries (Bolivia, Peru, Colombia) to survive is by
growing coca (source of cocaine) as a ''cash crop''.
Perhaps the speed with which President Clinton acted to circumvent
Congress and arrange, in co-operation with the IMF and Bank of
International Settlements, a $47.5bn Mexican bail-out can more easily be
understood in this context.
Sunday was wholly taken up with the workshops, this time instead of
dealing with the problem, the focus was on solutions and action to
ensure their implementation.
A large number of initiatives were brought back to the final plenary
session and were recommended for action by COMER and other organisations
represented at the conference.
The conference was quite clearly a huge success.
Campaigning for monetary reform will now be much more broadly based
and co-ordinated action will proceed in both Canada and the US.
It will reflect a unanimous acceptance that the key reform must
involve, in Canada, restoring to the Bank of Canada the responsibility,
enshrined in its constitution, of creating either debt free or at zero
or very low interest, all or nearly all of the money supply in the

Given that the ''monetary experiment'', currently followed by the

been centrally imposed and co-ordinated by the international financial
interests, through the Bank of International Settlements, it is
important that any campaign for change should also be international and
the COMER initiative is an important start to that process.
The alternative to radical monetary change along these lines is
inevitable progress to the threatened ''meltdown'' of the international
financial and economic system with which I opened this letter from
Canada.

A Scots distiller and a Spanish sherry-maker are toasting closer ties,
as Maggie Craig reports
WILLIAM Grant &amp; Sons, distiller of Glenfiddich whisky, has just
established a new partnership with Gonzalez Byass. The new link was
celebrated last week when over 100 of the Spanish firm's sales and
marketing force visited Dufftown to tour the Scottish company's two
distilleries.
As part of its ongoing marketing strategy in Europe, William Grant is
delighted that Gonzalez Byass will now be handling the distribution of
its brand in Spain. It sees many similarities between the two companies.
Both have a highly structured and focused operation and a large sales
force and strong marketing team. Like William Grant &amp; Sons, Gonzalez
Byass is a family business, with many members of the family involved in
day-to-day operations. Grant's consider this aspect as being crucial to
its own success, allowing it to take a long-term perspective, and is
keen to have good, stable relationships with like-minded companies.
According to David Grant, one of the directors of the company, the
Spanish visitors were highly impressed by the scale of the operation and
the level of preparations made for their visit. They were presented with
a two-and-a-half-foot replica of the number one still at Glenfiddich,
made by William Grant's own coppersmith. They also witnessed the
decanting of a cask of sherry Glenfiddich into a Gonzalez Byass fino
cask. The whisky was distilled in 1987, Grant's centenary year, and will
mature for another year. Each of the 122 visitors will receive a bottle
of it to commemorate the visit.
At a gala dinner during their stay the Spaniards were given the chance
to sample haggis and take part in some Highland dancing, the taste of
Highland culture designed to help them put the product in context. David
Grant says that Pedro Gonzalez-Gordon of Gonzalez Byass was particularly
struck by the warmth of the welcome he and his team received in the
North-east. It is perhaps only appropriate given that the new
partnership between Scotland and Spain has a historical precedent.
Senor Gonzalez-Gordon numbers among his ancestors a Gordon from
North-east Scotland who went out to Spain 200 years ago and went into
the sherry trade.

THE first windpower generation project proposed for the Island of
Lewis has been ruled out by the generation prices which the Scottish
Office expects. The news has led to disappointment among agencies who
were supportive of a project that has drawn little adverse environmental
comment, because of the unobtrusiveness of the proposed site. But there
is still some optimism that the scheme could be revived at a later
stage.
The proposal to site a wind farm in Lewis just two miles south of the
town of Stornoway, came from a firm of wind energy consultants who set
up a company, Arnish Electric Ltd, which has been carrying out tests on
the site, on the Arnish moor, for more than a year.
The site has been described as a natural bowl, which is virtually
hidden from the road nearby, but which is still open to the full force
of the wind. Nick Yencken, a spokesman for Arnish Electric, said: ''The
results of our tests have shown that this would be a good site, with
very good wind speed readings. It's disappointing that the prices
suggested by the Scottish Office have ruled us out.''
The Scottish Office announced the Scottish Renewable Obligation in
December, with 12 windpower projects getting approval. Although the
Order obliges Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric to sign
contracts with renewable energy generators for 15 years, developers have
been given five years to get their schemes up and running, but there
will be no replacement of schemes that fail.
According to Iain MacIver, the factor of the Stornoway Trust, on whose
land the tests were carried out, the prices set are a disappointment.
''The highest price for windpower was set at 4.17 pence per unit, which
rules out the Arnish Electric scheme. Some of the other schemes still do
not have planning permission and, according to those with a knowledge of
this type of generation, the figure put in by other companies will need
a lot of clarification. This scheme had wide backing, and would have
benefited the community through earning income from selling electricity
to the National Grid,'' he said.
According to Mr Yencken, there are several issues to be clarified.
''Projects were given the go-ahead, which are proposed for areas where
there is still argument about their suitability, and which could have
problems getting planning permission. This is a site which has broad
support and which would have benefited the local people. There is also a
question of the cost of getting electricity to the Islands, and how this
should figure in calculations of pricing structure -- the high cost of
National Grid  transmission could make our scheme very competitive.'' he
said.
But he insists that the proposal is still very much alive. ''We were
all surprised by the pricing structure.  But we are having another look
at the project and, with technology improving all the time, we are
confident we can get the price down even further. There should be
another round later this year, and we will be ready to re-submit this
scheme by then,'' he said.

Graham Ogilvy charts the success story of the enterprise which grew to
become Scotland's only dried flowers wholesaler.
BUSINESS is blossoming for Louise Carstairs and Scottish Everlastings,
the dried flowers enterprise which has grown to occupy half of the
steading on the family farm above Anstruther in Fife's picturesque East
Neuk.
Louise, the founder and driving force behind Scottish Everlastings,
typifies the gritty determination of generations of Scottish farming
folk to make good. But even by these exacting standards she is
exceptional.
A wee whirlwind of a woman, Louise takes her business seriously and
steadfastly refuses to fall into the trap of regarding her obvious
success as cut and dried. Innovation is at the heart of Everlastings,
displaying a commitment to research and development still found all too
rarely among the leading players of British industry.
Included in the eight employees in the refurbished Victorian farm
buildings which now house a drying shed, an arrangement assembly area,
an immaculate shop, and a gleaming laboratory, is a research chemist. He
has helped Louise develop new systems for flower preservation which are
currently pending patent and which promise to revolutionise the
industry.
When a smartly dressed Louise greets us at Carnbee, the farm which her
husband's family have worked for three generations, she has just
returned from a business meeting in London. Hers is an image which is
about as far removed from that of the rolling pin and scones vision of a
matronly farmer's wife serving bed and breakfast as it is possible to
get.
She even bridles slightly at having her business pigeon-holed as
''farm diversification''. She stresses: ''Everyone thinks that
Everlastings is a classic case of farm diversification, but I feel that
I would have done it anyway.''
What is not in doubt is that fields which would have been given over
to set-aside or mundane low-value crops of potatoes or turnips are now a
riot of colour each summer with acres of peony, poppy, larkspur,
nigella, and helichrysum comprising Fife's most unusual harvest.
Like so many successful enterprises down on the farm, Everlastings
developed out of a kitchen table hobby. Louise recalls the early days
leading up to the launch of the business in 1987: ''I used to import
dried flowers from Holland to colour, arrange, and sell locally. This
was proving to be a profitable exercise and I began to think seriously
about growing flowers myself.
''My husband had spare plots of land on the farm and it seemed an
ideal opportunity to become my own supplier and really begin to make
money. At the start that was not the intention. It was just a spin-off
from my love of dried flowers which goes back to childhood. But, as time
progressed, the idea of entering into business made more sense.''
The business began in 1987 with one part-time helper and a turnover in
the first year of #20,000. Today it is Scotland's only dried flowers
wholesaler distributing dried flowers, oils, baskets, and ribbons to a
network of 200 agents as well as selling direct to the public from the
spectacularly colourful farm shop. Ten acres are given over to flower
growing but, due to the vagaries of the Scottish weather, Everlastings
also continues to import flowers. Louise remains coy about the present
turnover, but concedes: ''We prefer to say that turnover has doubled
every year since we started.''
Basic arithmetic suggests an impressive performance and Louise and her
team have gained recognition for their innovation and determination. In
1992 and 1993 she won Department of Trade and Industry Smart awards for
innovation, using the prize money to equip her laboratory. A John Logie
Baird award followed and Louise is currently the only woman from the UK
to be selected for the prestigious Euroleaders business scheme.
Her new products consist of a revolutionary new preservative which
will allow her effectively to dry plants like heather that would
ordinarily crumble into dust and two products aimed at the fresh flowers
market. The latter will stop flowers from blossoming while they are
still in bud and then restart the process to order with obvious
consequences for the longevity of the fresh-flower market.
Louise is currently closing a deal with a Dutch flower supplier and is
talking to companies in Germany, Israel, and New Zealand. Everlastings
is also looking to participate in the ''Fourth Framework'', an EC
programme aimed at fostering cross-European partnerships in research and
development.
Unsurprisingly, Louise now spends an ever-increasing amount of her
time travelling and on the business tasks rather than her former passion
of flower arranging. But she remains defiantly proud of her achievements
as a Scottish woman.
She says: ''A lot of what has happened has come as a surprise to me. I
had no idea when I started off that I had any managerial or business
skills on which to build. But these are exactly the skills which women
acquire in their everyday life when they have to juggle to do 100 things
at once. I enjoy learning from others and build on my own skills. Now, I
enjoy the business side of things. All of the form-filling and
bureaucracy is a hassle but you just have to accept it. It has to be
done and I just regard it as a challenge.''
And Louise has taken to her European role like a duck to water. ''I
think of myself as a European,'' she says. ''When I go to Brussels, I
feel at home with the other people involved in Euroleaders. My husband
sometimes jokes that I am eccentric but these folk make me realise that
I am not odd or different, we are a similar breed of people.
''I have always had a very good reception as a Scot in Europe. I
believe that people on the continent notice a difference between the
English and the Scots and warm to the Scots more readily.''
She adds: ''I am hardly ever at home nowadays. But I love coming back
to Fife, I will always live here.''

WHEN car enthusiast Andrew Nicolson saw an advertisement for the sale
of a dormant company that produced miniature replicas of the Austin J40,
he just couldn't resist the challenge.
This week's TrialBlazer looks at Cars For Kids, the company that the
former investment and pensions consultant re-established last August and
relocated to his home in Inverness. From there he markets the revamped
replicas and so far business has been accelerating fast.
So what made Nicolson, who has no children himself, choose this
alternative and unusual career?
''I had been aware of the replicas being made by former Welsh miners
who could no longer go down the pits due to throat infection,'' he
explains. ''The original company was jointly funded by the Government
and Austin and produced over 32,000 replicas between 1948 and the late
fifties.
''These were made from tin and powered by pedals and most were
exported to America, South Africa, and Australia, with very few of the
original ones still remaining in the UK.''
The idea was adopted by a car enthusiast who ran a sales and servicing
business in Kilmarnock. Having bought the body mould, he made the cars
on a hobby basis for friends and colleagues. Other business commitments
forced him to abandon his hobby and sell the rights and the mould.
The company was advertised for sale last year in Kilmarnock and had
been dormant for more than two years. Nicolson was confident that with a
little modernisation the business could thrive under his management.
The cars, which retail at #1800, are now made with steel box-section
chassis and the tin bodywork has been replaced with the more durable
Fibreglass, moulded and painted by professionals in Inverness. The pedal
power has been replaced with an electric motor fed by a 12-volt battery
and there is a choice of paintwork and upholstery. The headlamps and
horns work as normal and the number plates are personalised at the time
of purchase. The headlamp trims, bumpers, grills, and hubcaps are all
genuine chrome and the gearstick is operational offering a choice of
forward, reverse, or neutral.
''There is even space in the boot for teddy!'' says Nicolson.
Safety is always an important issue with children and speed is
governed to a maximum of 4mph.
''I realise that it is important for parents to be able to catch their
children,'' explains Nicolson, ''so speed has to be kept to a minimum.''
Each car comes with its own battery charger which plugs in to the car
to deliver an overnight trickle charge. Nicolson has his own theory
about the type of market his cars are aimed at.
''I suppose the cars are appealing to the child who doesn't quite have
everything,'' he said, ''but it is actually the parents who do the
purchasing on behalf of their child.''
Cars For Kids now offer a buy-back deal with the possibility of a
future second-hand market developing.
''They are suitable for children aged between three and a half to 10
years' old,'' said Nicolson, ''so it made sense to offer this facility
so that the parents get some return on the car when the child finally
outgrows it.''
The company, which employs Nicolson and one other part-time engineer,
maintains a stock of six assembled cars of varying colours and
upholstery, but will generally produce cars to order.
Nicolson has exhibited the cars at craft and trade fairs and recently
won a #500 award for the best new Highland product at last year's
Highland Trade Fair. More recently he has been approaching up-market
retail stores throughout the UK to establish regular outlets and is
currently producing a brochure.
''I wouldn't want to say too much at this stage as nothing formal has
been agreed,'' he said, ''but I am optimistic as a great deal of
interest has been shown in the cars, not only from retailers in the UK
but also in America.
''If repeat orders could be secured then it may be possible to reduce
the unit cost.''
Following the last Highland Trade Fair, Nicolson received three
unexpected enquiries from doctors who wanted to know if the cars could
be adapted for disabled children.
''I hadn't really thought of electric cars as alternatives to electric
wheelchairs but I guess it does make sense,'' he says. ''The disabled
child is more likely to use it as a fun mode of transport rather than
simply a toy.''
It was with this in mind that he is currently working on a prototype
car which will have an extra inch and a half ground clearance and
''off-road'' type tyres. It also has the option of hand controls.
''The prototype will have an extra motor which should give it the
power to be used in woodchip park paths. I expect it to be ready for
trials in about six weeks,'' he concluded.

A truly innovative idea can benefit from European funding. Grace
Franklin reports
YES, you can get money out of Europe to aid business in Scotland.
Maria Craig can testify to that. ''I've just banked 9000 Ecu,'' said the
jubilant Maria at her office in a converted farmhouse near Bridge of
Allan. ''It proves that if you come up with a truly innovative idea,
Scottish businesses can benefit from European funding.'' ''That's about
#7000 and created four jobs.'' The jobs will ensure the completion of a
women's business directory for Tayside and Fife.
''This will be published in February,'' said Maria, who runs her own
training and business development company.
Her own creation, the Profiles Women's Business Directory, is a
runaway success in Central region. Used as a networking tool by women,
it is a means of making contact with a woman architect, lawyer, or
trainer or any woman in business.
''I was always being asked by women if I knew of a woman they could
contact in different spheres. There is a real need for a directory like
this. You need resources and tools to network effectively.' She first
identified the gap in the market when she was women's business adviser
at Stirling Enterprise Trust. ''Women setting up in business often asked
to deal with other women professionals but didn't know how to contact
them,'' explained Maria. ''Men meet others in the golf club, in the pub,
or the Rotary meeting. Women don't have the time to socialise like
that.''
So the idea of a directory is right and the Central Region Profiles
success, proved it. Not only do women -- and men -- refer to it when
they want a female principal, some of the women listed in that directory
are now meeting on a regular basis to help each other in business. After
Tayside and Fife, Strathclyde will be the next area to have a Profiles
Women's Business Directory.
And an all-Scotland directory is also underway. Maria is consulting
Strathclyde region Business Development Unit and Scottish Enterprise
with a view to expanding her Profiles system.
''This European money is a bonus,'' said Maria, who has worked in Abu
Dhabi, Hong Kong, Barbados, and Iran. ''It will enable me to pay the
right people to do the development work planned.'' She first heard of
the European money through Stirling University's Scottish Enterprise
Foundation. There, Dr Pat Richardson paid tribute to Maria's initiative.
''We are delighted she has done so well from the Local Employment Grant
scheme,'' she commented. ''Only half a dozen LEI grants have been given
out in the UK so it is nice to know one of the recipients personally.''
Dr Richardson is the UK representative for the LEI programme.
Applications from the UK have to be channelled through her. ''I wish
more people would apply,'' she said. ''These are new awards -- one for
creating jobs for women and one for innovative projects.'' Out of the
152 LEI grants awarded in Europe in 1994, three were Scottish and
received a total of 21,000 ecu (approx #16,500). The Scottish projects
created eight full-time jobs and five part-time jobs, and include
Maria's new team.
When Maria was researching her original idea she approached the
university to get professional help to check it out. She has retained
her connections with the university and continues to help the
development of women in business.
Said Maria: ''As well as publishing Profiles, I train women who want
to go into business.'' She works with Monklands Enterprise on their
management development programme for women and she is a director of
Stirling Women's Technology Centre.
In the past six months she has trained more than 80 women in business
start-up programmes in conjunction with Glasgow Women's Technology
Centre.
''The latest group graduated recently. It is truly encouraging to see
women take the initiative. But I know how much harder it is for them
than for men. They have to field home and family responsibilities as
well as create a business. On these courses the women make new friends
and can support each other as they set up in business.
''In one sense the Profiles Directory is another friend to women
entrepreneurs. I aim to make it available to all women in Scotland by
the time the United Nations World Conference on Women takes place next
year in Beijing.'' Since that event is scheduled for September, Maria
Craig has her work cut out. But Maria, who is an entrepreneur who
practises what she teaches, is fit for the challenge.

MUCH has been written of late on the subject of women entrepreneurs
and women in management. We have had courses and seminars and
conferences; there have been surveys and analysis upon analysis. All
sorts of people, bodies, and organisations have been investigating the
problem. All this activity would seem to suggest that there is a problem
with women, or worse, that women themselves have a problem. Hold it
right there, is what I say.
To any woman who is thinking of starting a business or moving up the
career ladder, my advice would be to ignore much of what you read and
hear and concentrate, instead, on the positive aspects that women have
to offer.
Women bring a new style of leadership to the market-place, perhaps it
is one that many men are not comfortable with, but that will change.
Women refuse to conform to the traditional style and methods of
entrepreneurship and management role models. We approach business in an
entirely different manner and eschew well-trodden paths of modus
operandi.
Women are more likely than men to use an interactive style of
leadership -- they encourage participation at all levels by naturally
trying to enhance other people's sense of self-worth and this, in turn,
energises other team members.
As a behavioural scientist, I know that people perform at their
optimum when they feel good about themselves and their work; when they
are made to feel part of the decision-making process and are rewarded
for their efforts. Women seem to have a natural talent for engendering
and encouraging this feel-good scenario.
They are not power mongers and will happily share the credit for new
ideas or problem solving and this can have a domino effect throughout an
organisation. It creates loyalty by signaling to colleagues and
subordinates that they are trusted and that their ideas are respected
and valued and it sets an example for other people to follow, so
enhancing the general communication flow of information within a company
both horizontally and vertically.
An added bonus is that this also increases the opportunity for
management to be made aware of problems before they become
insurmountable. This sharing of power and information allows everyone to
evaluate problems, compare solutions and arrive at mutually successful
conclusions.
If everyone stopped complaining about the inadequacies of women and
concentrated, instead, on their strengths we might begin to see some
immediate and lasting progress.
As entrepreneurs, women are finding powerful common denominators that
cross income and race barriers; we are on the threshold of a very
important time in our evolutionary business culture, but as always we
are dragged down by the old attitudinal problems that exist in Scotland.
Women must be made to feel that they can make a difference. Change is
all around us and everything is up for grabs. Many women returners
(horrible phrase) and female entrepreneurs are recognising that they can
reconcile the needs of the family with that of their business
aspirations. Technology means that we can communicate with the world
from the comfort of our own living room -- the days of nine to five have
long gone.
Nor do women feel the urgent need to earn mega bucks and impress their
friends with the flash car and the glitzy lifestyle; they are much more
likely to start small, concentrate on the basics, watch every penny and
as a result are much more likely to succeed than many of their male
counterparts. And when they do ''make it'' women are as dedicated and as
committed as the most successful of men and they are every bit as
shrewd! Just try selling to a woman -- she'll unpick your sales pitch
with pinpoint accuracy and will rarely be sold on glossy brochures or
fancy advertising.
Our country desperately needs imaginative break-the-rules
entrepreneurs and, since women have not been force-fed with ''the right
way to do it'', they are much more likely to come up with innovative
methods and practices. I am convinced that the female style of
management will increasingly become the preferred choice of many
organisations, but companies must be willing to accept that the
command-and-control mode of yesteryear is as outdated as yesterday's
milk.
So, while I am not denying that women do face barriers and hurdles in
the business environment, I am confident they will overcome them. Having
watched a number of ''beginners'' grow and develop into mature and
successful business women I know that the rewards are worth waiting for.
Only by valuing a diversity of entrepreneurial styles will we all
benefit from the skills and talents that women have to offer. If we
don't change and adapt and allow women the chance to breathe, we will
stifle a wonderful opportunity to build our economy and our society.
Yes, by all means let the courses and seminars continue, but let's
also recognise that women are a force to be reckoned with and the place
to start is with self-belief.
* Pat Martin, managing director of Pat Martin Associates and founder
of The Osprey Network, was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

SOME of the UK's biggest retailers are this week weighing up whether
to opt for Glasgow's proposed Buchanan Centre or the out-of-town
Braehead scheme at Renfrew.
The Buchanan Centre Partnership, developer of the 645,000 sq ft city
centre scheme, was strengthened at the weekend by AMP Asset Management's
purchase of a 50% stake from Grosvenor Square Properties. The other 50%
interest in the centre, which will be anchored by Glasgow's first John
Lewis store, continues to be held by Slough Estates.
The joint partners have announced that work could start later this
year, provoking a burst of interest from major retail chains.
One leading Glasgow commercial agent said some major retail operators
were now unsure whether to back the Braehead scheme or the Buchanan
Centre. He said: ''They want to know whether both schemes will
definitely go ahead -- and if so, which of the two they should seek
space in. Every major retailer wants the answer to that question.''
Both schemes have been dogged by rumour and delay. Braehead's
developers are Sainsbury, Marks &amp; Spencer and Capital Shopping Centres,
a powerful line-up which is attracting the interest of other leading
retailers. But opposition from the planners is causing some hesitation.
The developers already have consent for 675,000 sq ft of retail space
plus a further 375,000 sq ft of non-food retail warehousing. They have
now applied for consent for a revised scheme of 450,000 sq ft of retail
space and a reduced retail warehouse park.
The planners will almost certainly reject the revised scheme, leaving
the developers with the option of re-thinking their strategy or building
the larger scheme for which they have consent.
Glasgow-based surveyor Peter Campbell who is advising the developers,
said: ''If the revised scheme does not get planning approval then the
intention is that the bigger scheme will be developed. Retailers need
have no worries about Braehead, there is room in Glasgow for both
schemes.
''Most major retailers already have representation in Glasgow city
centre and I don't believe the Buchanan Centre will shift many of them.
But Braehead is a very different kettle of fish. It offers a major
opportunity for representation in the West of Scotland's most important
out-of-town scheme.''
Meanwhile, the new partnership of Slough Estates and AMP Asset
Management is now moving forward the plans for the Buchanan Centre, with
a view to starting construction later this year.
Roger Carey, group managing director of Slough Estates, said: ''We
have been in liaison with AMP and now their deal has been concluded, we
look forward to driving the development forward together.''

Scottish engineering -- with a small 'e' -- has a
long and honourable history. And despite its
changing fortunes in more recent years, the chief
executive of Scottish Engineering sees a strong
future for what is now a slimmer industry, 'straining
at the leash', he tells Harry Conroy.
ENGINEERING has felt the cold blast of three recessions in the last 15
years, making the survivors tough and lean. But now Brigadier Howard
Jordan, chief executive of Scottish Engineering describes the
engineering industry in Scotland as ''like a tiger straining at the
leash'', ready to take on world competition and beat it.
But to maintain our first division ranking position in world
engineering, he believes that Government must take positive action.
Brigadier Jordan points out that society can do little without
engineers. ''We cannot go on holiday, wash dishes, watch televison, or
cook without engineers being involved.''
Responding to the raised eyebrow regarding a relaxing holiday on a
sun-soaked beach, he reminds me that we often need a jet of some sort to
get us there, or indeed a ship or a car.
Scottish Engineering has 330 member companies employing 55,000 --
which is reckoned to be about 50 per cent of the workforce employed in
the sector.
Three recessions -- in the early and mid-eighties, and the early
nineties -- forced many companies to the wall, leaving says Brigadier
Jordan, with the better managed companies surviving.
''The banks did us a favour. A lot of companies in the early eighties
had old products, equipment and management. The banks would not support
these companies which left the market to better companies.''
According to the Scottish Engineering chief executive, firms were not
prepared for the first recession in the early eighties but were better
prepared for the second recession in the mid-eighties. By the time the
last recession hit in 1990, managements took the action that was
necessary.
''One of the reasons why the engineering industry in Scotland found
the nineties recession less fatal than companies in the South of England
was that we had served our apprenticeship in the eighties,'' explains
Brigadier Jordan, who took over the chief executive position of what was
then the Scottish Engineering Employment Federation in 1980.
In the new industrial world Brigadier Jordan believes the days of the
long order books have gone.
''Before the first recession companies had 18 months to two years
orders books, and said to customers here is what we can do for you and
when we can give you it.
''The position has changed, engineering companies now say to customers
what is it you want us to do and when do you want us to deliver it?''
Scottish Engineering, according to Brigadier, Jordan supplies the
parts of many finished products including printed circuits for Swedish
mobile telephones to such an extent that 60 per cent of Swedish mobile
phones have Scottish printed circuits.
Despite the reduction of people employed in our engineering industry,
Brigadier Jordan suggests that the value of output has not declined to
the same extent.
''The industry is smaller in employment terms, but technology has
advanced and equipment now does the work people did. In the past our
industry had one man per machine. Machine centres are now commonplace
where one person operates a bank of machines and tools via a computer.''
Brigadier Jordan worked in a foundry in Leith for a period after
leaving school at the age of 15, before he joined the Royal Corps of
Transport.
''I joined the army as a national serviceman,'' he explains, ''but
stayed on for 26 years.''
Since leaving full-time army employment he has continued to serve the
cadet force and is now Commandant of the Army Cadet Force in Scotland.
Looking to the future, he believes Scottish engineering will survive
by keeping a step ahead of emerging nations.
''There will be a greater emphasis on research and development,'' he
predicts -- while admitting he is not fully confident that we are doing
everything to maintain this position.
To ensure that we do, Brigadier Jordan believes ''we have to apply
national resources to get there'', and until recently he says there was
no indication that the Government was willing to do this.
However, in the past few months, he feels Michael Heseltine as
President of Board of Trade has recognised that engineering is a major
industry and part of the wealth creation of the UK.
''Five task forces are to be created as part of the Action for
Engineering concept, and the Scottish one is now being set up,'' he
says.
Professor David Tedford of Strathclyde University is responsible for
the Scottish Task Force whose job, says Brigadier Jordan, will be to
identify where we have the edge and develop such areas. He points to the
areospace industry as an example.
To maintain our position in this area, he believes the Government
should be prepared to invest cash in research and development up-front
-- ''We should not sit back and believe that market forces will keep us
in front''.
If we take the correct measures, the Scottish Engineering chief
executive is confident that the industry's output will grow in value --
although the number employed will not grow significantly.

THE origins of engineering in Scotland are obscure but in the late
eighteeenth century they were linked to the textile mills before a
period of rapid expansion following the invention of the hot blast
furnace by James Neilson in 1828.
The rapid expansion of the iron industry -- followed by steel-making
-- was paralleled by the rise of engineering companies.
The fledgling industry prospered as it supplied machinery not only to
the home market but to the British Empire. The West of Scotland was, for
a long period, the ''workshop of the British Empire''.
Sugar was an early example of this role, with Glasgow engineering
companies supplying machinery and sugar mills to the West Indies as well
as Mauritius, Brazil and Java.
Between 1851 and 1876, one firm, W &amp; A McOnie, built 820 steam engines
and 1650 sugar mills, 1200 steam boilers, 117 waterwheels and 169
evaporating pans.
Locomotive building was another example of a thriving Scottish
industry which supplied the developing nations.
Between 1873 and 1910 the Cape Government Railways in South Africa
bought 567 locomotives from Glasgow companies, and by 1909 India alone
had purchased more than 3,500.
By 1903 three companies -- Neilson &amp; Co, Dubs &amp; Co and Sharp Stewart &amp;
Co -- had between them built 16,000 locomotives. No fewer than 3,500 had
gone to India, 1000 to South Africa, and 357 to Australia.
The locomotive building industry declined between the First and Second
World Wars but between 1939 and 1153 locomotives were produced at Queens
Park in Glasgow.
Several giant companies grew up in the West of Scotland, including
William Beardmore &amp; Co at Parkhead and Dalmuir in Glasgow, and Singer
sewing machine manufacturers in Dalmuir.
Following the First World War competing factories sprang up abroad and
Scotland's pre-eminent position in engineering was challenged. Slowly,
household names such as Singer disappeared.
But 100,000 people are still employed by the industry, and Howard
Jordan of Scottish Engineering believes it will grow again in terms of
added value and output -- although there is unlikely to be a significant
increase in employment.

THE dentist's drill held little terror for amateur glass engraver
Geoff Nickolls. It was during a session of treatment in the dreaded
chair that 17-year-old Geoff was inspired to study drilling techniques
to help develop engraving as a full time occupation.
Now his artistic and remarkably comprehensive work can be found in
virtually every country in the world.
''I use dental drills,'' he explained, ''in much the same sort of way
as they are used in the laboratories and workshops of the dentistry
profession.
''When I decided to start full-time my engraving was at a stage of
being little more than a hobby, and it was at a time when there were no
instruction books or kits available on the subject.
''So after that initial chat with my dentist, I had to find drills and
seek out lots of advice from people in the industry to perfect the art.
''I needed to acquire the expertise, at that stage I wasn't too far
removed from whizzing away at the bottom of a milk bottle with a Black
and Decker!''
Using minute, diamond-hard drills he engraves to mark engagement,
wedding, anniversary, birthday, retiral, commemorative, or any of the
other inevitables or events of life.
Working from his tiny, Glass Engraved studio at the Antartex craft
village, at the Vale of Leven Industrial Estate, Dunbartonshire, he does
hearts and flowers aplenty.
But he's also turned his high-speed drills to a tankard to engrave a
JCB as a present for the boss of the earth-moving company. And he's
presented six delightfully different views of one man's boat on a set of
wine glasses.
Even more intriguing, he researched the architecture of a demolished
church to place on a rosebowl to mark a couple's golden wedding
anniversary.
In addition to requests for the unusual, Geoff gets more ordinary
repeats, the throughput of staff at the Clyde Submarine Base at Faslane
being some of his regular customers. Naturally, submarines, ships, and
nautical themes appear high on the order list.
''I get a lot of business from HMS Neptune, as I also do from the
Allied distillery and the J &amp; B whisky plant. And I've had work from the
Polaroid factory, too.''
People often take books and pictures to the studio to illustrate the
exact card, dog, or cat they would like to see reproduced on the glass.
But the reason his work travels so far is due to purchases made by
some of the 400,000-plus who visit Antartex every year, many on the way
to nearby Loch Lomond.
Several ranges of engraved subjects can be bought straight off the
shelf, including special Scottish themes -- wildlife and nature, the
arts, sport, historic and traditional design successfully converted on
to glass.
''With tourists I cannot fail with a thistle or a stag,'' laughed
Geoff. ''I reckon they are attracted to any traditional subject as a
reminder of their visit to Scotland.''
As far as Geoff knows he is the only person who is engraving on
recycled glass, ranging from blue, green, clear, and crystal -- items
which have helped place the business on a firm footing.
''I am only too well aware that some people cringe at going to the
dentist -- but I suppose I've got a lot to thank my dentist for!''
quipped Geoff.

For many years Scotland's music industry was non-existent, with groups
heading south to get breaks. Colin Wright finds that things have changed
so much that the Scots now form a musical force to be reckoned with.
SCOTLAND has always had a large number of successful musical
performers but the infrastructure and the confidence to operate
independently of London is only a recent phenomenon.
However, the fact that Scotland was well represented at the music
industry's premier event, MIDEM, in Cannes, is one indication of just
how far the industry has gone in establishing itself as a separate and
fully functioning independent entity.
And the Scottish Record Music Industry Association (SMIA) can claim
much of the credit for the Scottish turnout at Cannes this year. ''We
wouldn't have gone without the SMIA which has given us an understanding
that we are no different from anyone else in the music industry,''
explained Robin Morton, owner of Temple Records who represent and
produce Battlefield Band among others.
''My problems, with a record label turning over half a million a year,
are no different to Warner Brothers except in scale. The only difference
is their problems are multiplied by several millions -- but we all have
common issues which conferences like MIDEM help to address.
''Prior to the formation of the SMIA and attending MIDEM I thought of
myself and the other small labels in Scotland as part of a cottage
industry now I know that we are all part of the same thing. But
attending one of these conferences gives you a hell of a lot of
self-confidence.''
The current chairman of the SMIA is Ronnie Simpson, who runs Lismor
Records: ''The SMIA was originally set up to lobby for Scottish music
during the period of the changes in national copyright laws.
Subsequently we have participated in the select committee's report into
the price of CD's and have tried to maintain a close eye on changes in
the music industry which will affect our members.
''As a whole the industry turns over about #8m a year, and that is not
including Wet Wet Wet who are tied to an English record label. My own
label sells to over 50 countries and most of us involved in the industry
are dealing on a global basis.''
One band who have remained resolutely Scottish both in their outlook
and in their approach is Runrig. Their manager, Marlene Ross, explained
how they approach the music industry in London: ''I wouldn't accept that
we had to fly down to meet them in London, I always asked them to come
up here (to Aberdeen). You don't have to go along with the view that
London is where everybody who is anybody works. I've always found that
if you balance their books for them, and make the band profitable then
they will go along with whatever you ask and will have meetings in
Scotland.''
Another central part of the Scottish music industry over the last 15
to 20 years have been the Edinburgh-based promoters Regular Music. They
have emerged as the largest promoters in Scotland, bringing
international names to an increasing number of venues. Company
co-founder Barry Wright explained: ''We have nurtured venues over the
last 20 years. In the seventies the Average White Band had to leave
Scotland to make it. Now Scottish bands have all the venues and
infrastructure to develop here.
''We have opened up every major venue in Scotland. Prior to Regular
Music there was only the Usher Hall and Glasgow City Hall. We were the
first to open the Playhouse, the SECC and many other outlets for
bands.''
This expansion of the industry has meant that at the peak of
promotions in the late eighties touring bands were making 10-20% of
profits from the Scottish part of their UK tours.
One of the key reasons for the success of the Scottish music industry
over the last decade or so seems to have been an increase in confidence
and the view that you don't have to look to London for information,
advice or money. For, as Barry Wright explained, Scotland currently has
an infrastructure capable of developing and promoting its own music:
''When we started there was no PA company, no lighting, no lighting, no
lawyers, no other promoter up here. Now we have all of those things and
the circuit of venues from the smallest to the largest to utilise.''
Marlene Ross believes that it takes determination to hold out against
the offers and attractions available to groups if they move to London:
''We were told that it would be easier if we moved to London but I know
I would have died within a week of moving down there. It's what you want
out of life, the quality of life that matters. We were going for eight
years before anyone in London was interested but we were making a living
and enjoying ourselves and could have kept on like that without the
additional success. Now that we've had it things are better but we could
have gone on without it.''

AN Ayrshire company has hit the National Lottery jackpot with a #1m
order confirmed yesterday to print tickets for the ever growing
competition.
The management and workforce this week expressed their delight at the
order -- especially when it was discovered that suppliers to lottery
company Camelot are just as entitled to have a flutter as the rest of
us.
Ritchie (UK) Limited will print millions of the now familiar lottery
tickets in the coming year and managing director Robert Craig is
confident that there will be more business to come.
The company, employing over 200 at bases in Kilmarnock, Glasgow and
Edinburgh, was bought out by its management from the Sears Group in 1987
and has seen turnover build from less than #6m to in excess of #14m and
its reputation grow at the same pleasing rate.
Mr Craig said: ''When we bought out the company it was trying to be
all things to all men and doing everything from shoe boxes to office
furniture and specialist printing.
''Now I believe we have found the core business on which we will build
and which has allowed us to become market leaders in a wide range of
products.''
That core business is in security printing and everyone who buys their
groceries, fills their car with petrol or tries their luck at the pools
or now the National Lottery will come across Ritchie products.
From fixed odds coupons, thousands of which are turned around in a few
hours each weekend after the confidential figures have been flashed to
Kilmarnock, to credit and debit card vouchers using carbonless paper.
Blue-chip clients include Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury's, Tesco and the
major Scottish banks as well as leading oil companies.
Said Mr Craig: ''We have built our reputation on reliability, quality
and the level of security which dealing in markets like these requires.
For example, the fixed odds are worked out and remain confidential until
issued the following week.
''We were all thoroughly checked out by Camelot before being awarded
the contract for the tickets and some of the staff were worried that
they would not be able to take part in the Lottery because of the part
we were playing in it. I checked and was able to tell them that the only
person not able to take part is the director-general of the watchdog
body Oflot.''
Although the contract represents just over 7% of current turnover it
has come at just the right time with the downturn in orders for computer
paper brought on by advances in CD-ROM and other technologcial
innovations threatening to squeeze the company.
Mr Craig added: ''We have always tried as far as possible to be ahead
of changes or at least develop with them and we will be investing over
#750,000 in machinery for the Lottery business and other contracts we
are working on.''
The printing business for the many millions of tickets is being shared
out around the country but Mr Craig is confident that he will not only
keep his company's share and watch it grow as the results begin to speak
for themselves.
He is also working to ensure that orders for paper and possibly
delivery and distribution is handled by Scottish companies.
Despite the Ritchie (UK) title the company is already working in
European markets with Belgian football pools and other customers. Mr
Craig is hoping to expand into the lotteries of countries like France,
Spain and Sweden using the expertise gained this year.
He is full of praise for the work of Enterprise Ayrshire in helping
his company grow but is hopeful that local politicians may take a little
more notice of what is happening on their doorstep.
And what, we hear you ask, are the numbers which Robert Craig fills in
on a Saturday at his local National Lottery outlet. ''That would be
telling,'' comes the swift reply.

PENSION funds run by Glasgow Investment Managers topped the
performance tables over the past year, achieving a result well ahead of
the pack.
The company achieved a total return of 5.4%, easily achieving the top
slot for mixed with property funds in 1994.
The next best performance came from Scottish Equitable which made
1.3%. For comparison the upper quartile figure was minus 3.9% and the
median minus 5.2%.
The tables come from the latest survey by CAPS, the pension fund
monitor.
Last year was no flash in the pan for Glasgow Investment Managers
because the firm also topped the five-year performance table with growth
of 13.4% per annum. Morgan Grenfell was second with 11.8%.
At the other end of the scale the worst one-year showing came from
Ulster Bank with an 10.9% fall. National Mutual Life was next at minus
8.7%. Over five years Guardian Royal Exchange achieved growth of only
5.3% and Scottish Provident 6.4%.
CAPS says that over the past 10 years, UK equities produced by far the
best returns, averaging 14.3% per year. However, managers should have
concentrated on gilts over the past five years as they outperformed
equities, even after 1994's dismal showing.

ALEXANDERS Holdings has suffered the exquisite embarrassment of
discovering that it paid its 0.3p interim dividend when the holding
company had insufficient reserves and had not filed the half-time
results with the Registrar of Companies as is required in these
circumstances, writes ANDREW WILSON.
In theory, shareholders could be called upon to repay the near #69,000
involved -- the probable reaction needs little imagination. But this
ultra viresposition is being put right through an extraordinary meeting
-- a similar state of affairs has pertained at Wellcome.
More pertinently, the Edinburgh based Ford dealer has ended the year
to last September in good shape wth sales surging 27.5% to #111m. That
boosted pre-tax profits 83% to #935,000. Encouragingly, it has
outperformed the Ford national figures in both retail and fleet sales
with the latter in particular showing exceptionally good growth.
However, margins have remained under pressure at 1.1% and in an
attempt to reduce the cost base there will have to be restructuring
moves that will reduce the number of employees from the current 321.
Alexanders, chaired by controlling shareholder Mrs Aleksandra Clayton,
has four Scottish franchises in Edinburgh, Greenock, Kirkintilloch and
Paisley and at Northampton in England.
Last October it bought a multi-franchise operation in Lincoln for
#1.75m which will contribute in the current year. The dividend total is
being doubled to 1p witha 0.7p final. The shares closed 1p higher at 21p
for a 6% yield.

MINING (Scotland), parent company of the new Scottish Coal Company,
was urged yesterday to find room in its long-term business plan for the
wealth of Scots energy represented by the mothballed Frances colliery,
writes BILL MAGEE.
The Fife pit has been under care-and-maintainance for a decade and
British Coal now plans to shutdown pumping operations, while mining
unions have called on SCC to keep the Frances open.
In the absence of this Mining (Scotland) is now being asked to not
overlook the colliery's high-quality/low-sulphur reserves.
The new owner of the country's deep-mine and open-cast assets included
the Frances development in its bid for the coalfield last year, but is
committed to a #50m investment over the next few years at Kincardine to
develop the Longannet complex. It is also looking to expand open-cast
interests.
The call for the coal company to take a fresh look at the East Fife
pit has been made by Eric Clarke, MP for Midlothian, and the firm's
Parliamentary adviser.
He said: ''While the company is in its infancy and British Coal's
actions are totally unfair, I would nevertheless appeal to the
shareholders of Mining (Scotland) to see if a compromise can be reached
to somehow keep Frances alive, by absorbing the pit into its plans.''
Of the British Coal inaction, Mr Clarke added: ''With respect to
inward investment, thousands of pounds per job is spent to attract the
likes of Nippon Electronics, itself a very rich company.
''By comparison the Government should treat its indigenous industry
better.''
Developing the Frances colliery, long term, was the key to unlocking
at least 1000 new jobs for Scotland, he said.
Michael McGahey, former NUM area president, said: ''There are rich
reserves within Frances belonging to the Scottish people and which
should be exploited.''
One of the first tasks of new Mining (Scotland) chairman Dr Ian
Preston will therefore be to canvass opinion from his board and
shareholders about the viability of at least keeping Frances on
care-and-maintainance basis until the money can be found to develop the
East Fife coalfield.
The business plan of the Mining (Scotland)'s trading company has an
envisaged annual turnover of #150m-200m.

* GORDON SMITH has 562 properties under his control, bringing in #3
million rental income. He has also just completed a #3.5 million deal
with Wimpey for a site in Motherwell town centre.
But Gordon is not merely interested in the rental income he raises
from the properties or indeed what price he can obtain for a piece of
real estate.
Unlike most property executives, Gordon does not measure his success
simply in pounds sterling. His priority is JOBS.
Gordon is head of Motherwell District Council's estates and business
development department. His major task is to replace the jobs lost by
the closure of Ravenscraig.
''What finally makes a firm decide to choose a particular location is
often the availability of property,'' he says, ''so we have to ensure we
have property available for incoming companies. We are not a property
company; we are only interested in jobs for this area.''
One of the District Council's prime sites is the 37 acres of the
Excelsior Enterprize Zone at Netherton.
Already 150 jobs have been secured by the building of six advance
factories on this site which was formerly a scrap yard and nail factory.
Courtaulds is also building a factory on the site which will ensure
the future of 200 jobs in the area as there was a danger that Courtaulds
could have transferred the work down south if a suitable site had not
been available.
The District Council will also shortly be announcing a major
development on a 10-acre site in the Enterprize Zone which will create
300 new jobs.
''In addition to these developments,'' says Gordon Smith, ''we are
also talking to several companies just now about their locating in the
area which if we pull it off will mean a further 400 jobs.''
Gordon admits to getting job satisfaction when he sees the results of
an empty site being converted into a modern industrial site with people
working in modern factories.
He got particular satisfaction from completing the recent #3.5 million
deal with Wimpey in Motherwell town centre.
''There was a town centre redevelopment programme in place when I
joined the council shortly after it was formed in 1975 but we had many
ownership problems and it has taken us until now to complete the
programme,'' says Gordon.
When he is not wheeling and dealing in property on behalf of the
District Council, his favourite recreations are listing to jazz in the
morning, watching Hearts in the afternoon, then relax at the opera --
preferably Wagner -- in the evening.

* AS a primary school teacher Ann Murdoch spent most of her time
telling children not to speak in the classroom; but a switch in career
meant that her aim in life was to encourage people to speak as often as
possible.
Ann runs Speakeasy, which provides after-dinner speakers for functions
throughout the country, but she leaves most of the speaking in the
family to her husband David, a former referee, who now runs a public
relations consultancy.
''I have spoken at a few Rotary Club meetings but never for money,''
she says. ''But David is, of course, on our list of speakers -- though
he probably suffers as I try to make sure that I don't promote him more
than our others.
Speakeasy organises speakers for dinners throughout the country --
from the Shetlands to Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow and even London --
and it is all done from the Murdochs' charming home overlooking the
harbour at Lower Largo in Fife.
''I am very rarely at any of these functions, even when David is
speaking,'' says Ann. ''I handle the business via the phone and fax.''
Speakeasy provides such names as Bob Crampsie, Sheriff Nigel Thompson
and Craigie Vietch for dinners. Journalist Dorothy Grace Elder is also
among the speakers, and she recently broke new ground when she was asked
to reply on behalf of the lassies at a Burns Supper.
''We have never been asked before to provide a lady speaker for a
Burns Supper, but we were informed that Dorothy was a great success,''
says Ann.

JOHN FRASER divides his time between negotiating with hard-nosed oil
executives and trying to raise cash for children.
He is chairman of Tube Developments, a company he formed 25 years ago
to supply steel tubes mainly to Clyde shipyards. As this industry
declined, the company targeted the petrochemical industry and
subsequently North Sea oil. At its massive 350,000 sq ft site in
Kilsyth, near Glasgow, thousands of steel tubes are stored in ten
warehouses.
''We try to crystal-ball the industry,'' says John, ''by anticipating
their needs for special casing pipes. Many rigs are now completed on the
design-and-build basis, and companies could wait for six or nine months
for a specialist steel tube from the manufacturer but we try to have it
in stock.''
John is now chairman of the company, while his son Ian is managing
director, and his other son Stephen is sales director.
The Scottish company does not only supply the North Sea oil industry
-- it also has customers in the Middle East and Singapore and currently
has a salesman in America looking for orders.
While John's mind might be trying to second-guess the international
oil industry, his heart is elsewhere. He is vice chairman of the Variety
Club of Great Britain's Scottish committee and devotes a great deal of
his spare time to raising cash for the charity.
A conversation with him jumps between the supply of mild steel tube to
specification BS3601 and APE 5L grade B to the charity's bid to sell
50,000 Gold Hearts in Scotland for #1 each. The Gold Hearts are being
distributed from the charity's office in Crow Road, Glasgow.
The Gold Heart Appeal will culminate on February 14 when Sky TV runs a
telethon in aid of the appeal.
''Cheques raised by Scottish activities will be presented to the
charity at Sky's Livingston studios, and all the money raised in
Scotland will be spent here,'' says John.
Last year the charity presented 15 of its famous Sunshine coaches
(costing between #18,000 and #21,000) to handicapped schools in
Scotland. But John points out that the Variety Club does not confine
itself to Sunshine Coaches.
''We raise cash to pay for computers that respond to a person simply
blowing, and also motorised wheelchairs which cost around #5,000 each.''
But back to steel tubes: John explains why he started up the business
-- ''I was a pipework engineer working in the shipyards before I worked
for another steel tube stockist, but I saw a niche in the market for
specialist tubes and decided to go out on my own.
''The niche has grown to the position where Tube Developments is one
of the largest stockists in Europe of seamless process pipe and the ten
warehouses in Kilsyth can hold over 10,000 tonnes of material.

THIS fuss over the appointment of top execs to Scotland's new water
quangos has ignored one important point. There are only three of them.
This leaves a whole raft of movers and shakers in the Scottish business
community seething with resentment. They have become gripers and
whiners.
''I don't know why Ian Lang didn't consider our Chairman,'' said The
Braces yesterday at our nicotine break in the Nerd House commissariat.
''He has all the right credentials.''
I asked: What exactly are the right credentials?
''Well for a start,'' said The Braces, ''he must know a helluva lot
about sewage and plumbing. He has his own washroom. He seems to spend a
great deal of time in there, according to my information.''
What information was that? ''Every time I try to get in touch with
him,'' said The Braces, ''his secretary says 'I'm sorry, but at this
moment the Chairman is in his washroom'.'' (The Braces' mimickry of a
Kelvinside accent is quite professional.)
Ms Angelica Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, gave a short
laugh. One ''ha'' instead of two. She said: ''Surely, Braces, you
haven't been taken in by that ploy. The phrase 'in his washroom' is a
euphemism, a dodge if you like.
''Whenever the secretary gets a call for the Chairman she repeats the
caller's name with ostentatious emphasis -- you must have heard her
doing this. If he doesn't want to take the call, he points towards the
washroom. It's a well-tried routine.''
The Braces looked suitably chastened. Then I said: ''But surely this
increases the Chairman's qualifications for heading one of the new water
quangos. We've established that he doesn't spend as much time in his
washroom as people might think.
''A first-hand knowledge of sewage and plumbing might be seen as a
minus point. What Mr Ian Lang was looking for, I'm sure, was an entirely
new business-aligned approach to the job in hand. Too much knowledge of
where water comes from, or where sewage goes to, could easily interfere
with new visionary initiatives.''
This proposition was accepted, with much nodding and sucking at
filter-tips. The Braces developed the theme by speculating that Mr Ian
Lang had actually phoned Nerd House intending to ask the Chairman if he
would like to become the head of a Scottish water quango. When the
Chairman's secretary repeated the Scottish Secretary's name with her
usual emphasis, the Chairman thought it was a spoof and pointed to the
washroom. And when Mr Lang learned the Chairman was in the washroom, he
concluded that he must have known too much about sewage and plumbing to
bring a new visionary approach to the task in hand.
''It's a great pity,'' sighed The Braces. ''The Chairman's other great
qualification is that he's a Tory voter who's not a member of the
Conservative Party.'' This seemed to deep to go into. But we couldn't
argue against The Braces' final proposition. ''If he'd been on 30 grand
for a two-day week, that would have been two happier days for us.''
Indeed.

BANK of England attempts to reassure financial markets that the
Government's inflation target could be met were upset by a fresh bout of
weakness in sterling.
Fears that the Government's days could be numbered have been
undermining the pound's standing on foreign exchange markets since
Friday, the day after interest rates were raised by half-a-point to
6.75%.
Sterling lost further ground yesterday, especially against the German
mark as rumours circulated in the City that Conservative chairman Jeremy
Hanley had told party members to prepare for an early election.
This was denied by Conservative Central Office. An official said,
''No, he didn't say that at all. He said there would be an election in
the next 27 months, which is a constitutional fact.''
The Bank of England's inflation report and quarterly bulletin,
published at 10.30 when a summary of its conclusions was flashed around
the City, was largely ignored as the pound came under renewed pressure
after a major selling order was executed.
Sterling staged a partial recovery in the afternoon, but still lost
nearly 1[1/4] pfennigs to DM2.3788 and a third-of-a-cent to $1.5530. Its
trade-weighted exchange rate fell 0.5 to 87.3, extending its losses from
88.7 a week ago.
''Without the increases in interest rates since the previous report
(in November), the Bank's central projection would now have been for
inflation to be in the upper half of the target range,'' the Bank
claimed.
With the benefit of three rate hikes since September the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street is still projecting underlying inflation two years
ahead of around 2.5%, the mid point of the target range -- with the
upside risks somewhat less than before.
''The tightening of monetary policy since November has, therefore,
improved the prospect of achieving the lower half of the target range by
the end of the present Parliament,'' the report concluded.
The upside risks to the inflation target, which had been highlighted
in the November report, had lessened because of the rate rises, Mr
Mervyn King, the Bank's economics director, told the first ever on the
record briefing on the quarterly bulletin.
Otherwise the inflation forecast would have been in the 2.5% to 3%
range.
Mr King offered no guidance on the future path of base rates. ''I
cannot tell you either when or whether they will need to go up again. We
take it one month at a time.''
He warned against getting locked into a pre-planned schedule of
interest rate changes. ''We will now have to see what the next set of
data shows.''
The report took pride in sterling's relative stability, marred in the
last few days, and acknowledged that output growth had fallen from an
annualised rate of well over 4% in the first half of last year to about
3% in the second.
The latest inflation indicators were higher than expected in the
previous report for the first time since the Bank was signed up as the
nation's inflation watchdog after the pound left Europe's exchange rate
mechanism.
Underlying inflation is now expected to rise further over the next six
months and peak at between 3% and 3.5%. Retail price inflation is likely
to pick up as some of the squeeze on retail margins unwinds, the report
said. A weak pound could aggravate the situation.
Mr King said the pound was only one of the factors used by the Bank in
determining monetary policy and denied that any specific targets had
been set for sterling.
The risks to the Bank's two-year inflation forecast remain mainly on
the upside. ''The probability of it being in the lower half of the range
is less than the probability of it being in the upper half,'' the report
said.
The main threats include above trend growth in output, capacity
constraints, especially at export producers, a greater than expected
recovery in retail margins, and an upturn in earnings growth.     Mr
King was concerned about possible upward revisions to the latest output
data as has happened throughout the upswing in activity.
He confirmed that the Government would have to restate its inflation
target this year to take it beyond the life of the present Parliament.
Monetary policy changes take up to two years to affect inflation,
according to the Bank.
The validity of targeting underlying inflation, which excludes only
mortgage interest payments, has been questioned, not least by Bank
economists.
There has been speculation of a switch to a target band of zero to 3%
on a narrower measure, which would also strip out changes in value-added
tax, excise duties, and council taxes.

A WORKING partnership between the public and private sectors has its
culmination tomorrow at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall.
It's decision day for choosing the best examples of applied quality
service among all the various departments making up the 100,000-plus
staff in Strathclyde Regional Council.
Who wins the Customer Care trophy sponsored by ScottishPower? Or the
Business Process trophy from United Distillers? The Value for Money
trophy coming from Moat House International? Or the Strathclyde Quality
Award, covering some aspect that may not fit neatly into the three other
categories?
The roads department, for example, has produced a whole new system for
carrying out street inspections. If it does not prevent potholes from
appearing all over the place, at least it speeds up the process of
identifying and dealing with them.
Already, it has meant fewer claims from motorists and pedestrians.
Along with improved service, goes a saving in costs. Some annual
departmental savings can be assessed as six-figure sums.
Quality service also directly affects youngsters and senior citizens
alike.
Take Tormusk Primary in Castlemilk, for example. Headteacher Jim
Callery had the familiar problems of absenteeism, and less than 100%
enthusiasm from the local community.
The change, for pupils, parents and staff, has been dramatic. There is
a new attitude to schooling, and to taking an active part in school
development.
At the other end of the age scale, there have been changes at Burnbank
House in Glasgow, which offers residential and respite care for older
members of the community.
Many had problems of dementia, and a lack of visits from friends or
relatives. They tended to sit by themselves, and find little of interest
in their lives.
Now, a shop has been set up in the home. It's run by residents. There
is also a bar. Run by staff this time, but with a volunteer mobile
service to meet the needs of frailer residents. A minibus gets people
out and about in the community.

HIGH Street spending around Christmas time is crucial to the fortunes
of Amstrad, the consumer electronics company founded by Alan Sugar.
Given continuing weak demand for its mature products throughout Europe
and internal restructuring within the company it is not surprising that
profitability is under pressure.
In the six months to December 31 it made a smaller-than-expected
profit of just #25,000 before tax in what has traditionally been the
stronger trading half. That compares with #1.7m previously but the
interim dividend was maintained at 1.0p.
Profits were dragged down by about #7m of stock write-downs and
rationalisation provisions which pushed continuing operations into a
loss of #8.5m. Most of the write-downs relate to Amstrad Consumer
Electronics (ACE).
Normally one would have expected Amstrad to make a loss at the
year-end on the basis of its low interim profitability but Mr Sugar said
that the nature of Amstrad's business had changed to such an extent that
''seasonal factors are not as significant''. He added that the half-year
position should be maintained in the second half.
Of more importance to the future is the progress made by David Rogers,
the new chief executive, in reshaping the group's business. ACE is said
to have improved its trading performance recently helped by the
establishment last November of a direct selling operation. Amstrad
Direct sells faxes and computer direct to consumers. The benefits of
restructuring ACE under new management are expected to be felt next
year.
Two recent acquisitions are making encouraging progress. Viglen, the
personal computer manufacturer, made a profit of #5m. Its production
capacity will increase with the opening of a new factory.
The company's policy of taking an immediate write-down against
reserves of goodwill arising from the Viglen acquisition led a reduction
in Amstrad's net asset value. Net current assets dropped to #177.8m from
#228.1m.
Dancall Telecom, the telecoms equipment manufacturer, is said to be
making money. Later this year Dancall is to launch its new digital
cellular telephone.
Also on the positive side the group's balance sheet was strong with
net interest of #2.7m on its #136.4m cash pile.
Many in the City believe that Anstrad has turned the corner and can
look forward to a brighter future. The strong cash position together
with analysts forecasts for profits of #15m-#20m in 1996 helped Amstrad
shares gain 8p to 141p.

A WORKING partnership between the public and private sectors has its
culmination tomorrow at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall.
It's decision day for choosing the best examples of applied quality
service among all the various departments making up the 100,000-plus
staff in Strathclyde Regional Council.
Who wins the Customer Care trophy sponsored by ScottishPower? Or the
Business Process trophy from United Distillers? The Value for Money
trophy coming from Moat House International? Or the Strathclyde Quality
Award, covering some aspect that may not fit neatly into the three other
categories?
The roads department, for example, has produced a whole new system for
carrying out street inspections. If it does not prevent potholes from
appearing all over the place, at least it speeds up the process of
identifying and dealing with them.
Already, it has meant fewer claims from motorists and pedestrians.
Along with improved service, goes a saving in costs. Some annual
departmental savings can be assessed as six-figure sums.
Quality service also directly affects youngsters and senior citizens
alike.
Take Tormusk Primary in Castlemilk, for example. Headteacher Jim
Callery had the familiar problems of absenteeism, and less than 100%
enthusiasm from the local community.
The change, for pupils, parents and staff, has been dramatic. There is
a new attitude to schooling, and to taking an active part in school
development.
At the other end of the age scale, there have been changes at Burnbank
House in Glasgow, which offers residential and respite care for older
members of the community.
Many had problems of dementia, and a lack of visits from friends or
relatives. They tended to sit by themselves, and find little of interest
in their lives.
Now, a shop has been set up in the home. It's run by residents. There
is also a bar. Run by staff this time, but with a volunteer mobile
service to meet the needs of frailer residents. A minibus gets people
out and about in the community.
Old-fashioned ''spyholes' have been removed from doors. There are now
panes of stained glass, selected by the residents, and still allowing
staff to make sure everything is in order, without interfering with
privacy.
Looking at the overall effect throughout the region, Duncan Whyte,
chief operating officer with ScottishPower, said: ''We are delighted
these awards are helping to improve the council's service to the people
of Strathclyde in so many ways.
''I am sure it would benefit a number of companies in the private
sector, to look closely at what has been achieved by council staff, and
take these lessons on board.''

Local Government at Strathclyde University; Alan Devereux, chair of
Quality Scotland Foundation; Stephen Carter former general manager with
Moat House International; James McGrath, quality manager with United
Distillers; and Hamilton Smillie of ScottishPower.

FROM April 1 Scotland could see the roofs being torn off empty
buildings, internal staircases demolished, or pipes and fittings ripped
out, as rates on empty buildings are charged for the first time.
From April 1, many non-domestic properties which have been unoccupied
for more than three months will be liable for 50% of the normal rates
payable. Offices and shops will be hit, but most industrial premises
will be exempt.
South of the Border where ''empty rates'' have been enforced for many
years, developers and landlords frequently damage their empty buildings
in a bid to claim exemption on the grounds that the property is
unusable.
''It's nothing less than institutionalised vandalism, and we could see
it come to Scotland,'' said Bob Mowat, a rating specialist with
chartered surveyor D M Hall.
''In one of the most notorious examples, staircases were torn out of
London's Centre Point to avoid paying empty rates. The abolition of
vacant rates relief will have major on-going repercussions in the
Scottish property market.''
As landlords scramble to offload empty buildings, he predicts a
two-tier market with some properties available at a peppercorn rental to
reduce the landlord's commitment, while other tenants who are tied into
longer leases will find their rents reviewed upwards every five years.
The already very slow speculative development sector will also be hit
as developers postpone projects until they have a guaranteed occupier
for the scheme.
''It's ironic that this is happening -- everyone in England regarded
the Scottish rating situation as superior to theirs, now we're facing
the same daft dilemmas,'' said Philip Reid of surveyor Jones Lang
Wootton.
''If you disconnect the power, will that be sufficient to avoid 50%
rates? Nobody knows how the rules will be interpreted.''
Inquiries by D M Hall indicate confusion among the rating authorities.
''Some say that the three months starts on April 1, so an empty building
will be liable from July 1. But others say that any building empty from
January 1 1995 to April 1 should immediately receive a demand,'' said Mr
Mowat.
''Class 4 buildings, the modern pavilions which have been developed on
business parks, can be used as either offices or light industrial
premises.
''If such a property is empty, we can't be sure whether it will be
treated as office space or industrial space,'' he added.
The new rules come into effect on April 1 under the Non-Domestic
Rating (Unoccupied Property) (Scotland) Regulations 1994. Exceptions
include ancient monuments; industrial property used for manufacturing,
storage or distribution; buildings with a rateable value less than
#1000; and listed buildings -- but there is uncertainty about modern
offices standing behind a retained listed facade.

THE importance of Scotland as a market in its own right was underlined
by Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of the Argyll Group, when he addressed
the conference held by the Institute of Grocery Distribution at Heriot
Watt University, Riccarton near Edinburgh, yesterday.
Scotland, he said, was a #6000m grocery market. Scotland was much more
than a region. It was a national market which was quite distinctive.
Sir Alistair said it was not easy to make statements fully acceptable
to all Scots.
''If you stress the advantages of the Union and the benefits which
flow from almost 300 years of English/Scottish partnership, you can be
accused of being ignorant of the continuing and vibrant national
identity of Scotland, of the Scots, and of the Scottish national
institutions.
''If you take the other tack and propose that Scotland should be
regarded as a separate country and a separate market, while the Scot
Nats may applaud your sentiments they and other Scots will be the first
to complain if the benefits of scale are in any way sacrificed through
downsizing the market from 56 million to around five million.''
Sir Alistair said that as a grocer he was wholly sympathetic to the
idea that ''you can't win, because this continuing ambivalence about the
Union or devolution is both a deep-set instinctive trait in the Scottish
character and a well-developed negotiating position which has been
exploited for all of 292 years''.
Asked later about the possibility of Scotland becoming independent, he
replied that the group would regard such a situation as independence
with open borders, given that the UK would be one market and Europe one
market.
Sir Alistair said that Argyll's development of stores in Scotland was
very much a vote of confidence in the country.
When Argyll acquired Safeway in March 1987, it had 22 Safeway stores
and 34 large and 133 smaller Presto. By the end of March this year, it
would have 61 Safeway and 109 Presto.
The group had invested #350m, and Scotland now represented 18% of
Argyll's business.
In 1990, Safeway opened a major distribution centre at Bellshill. This
centre was also a valuable launch pad for smaller companies to build up
their sales in Scotland and make a wider distribution south of the
Border.

<HEADLINE>Bank of England's attempts to reassure markets are upset by sterling weakness</HEADLINE>

BANK of England attempts to reassure financial markets that the
Government's inflation target could be met were upset by a fresh bout of
weakness in sterling.
Fears that the Government's days could be numbered have been
undermining the pound's standing on foreign exchange markets since
Friday, the day after interest rates were raised by half-a-point to
6.75%.
Sterling lost further ground yesterday, especially against the German
mark as rumours circulated in the City that Conservative chairman Jeremy
Hanley had told party members to prepare for an early election.
This was denied by Conservative Central Office. An official said,
''No, he didn't say that at all. He said there would be an election in
the next 27 months, which is a constitutional fact.''
The Bank of England's inflation report and quarterly bulletin,
published at 10.30 when a summary of its conclusions was flashed around
the City, was largely ignored as the pound came under renewed pressure
after a major selling order was executed.
Sterling staged a partial recovery in the afternoon, but still lost
nearly 1[1/4] pfennigs to DM2.3788 and a third-of-a-cent to $1.5530. Its
trade-weighted exchange rate fell 0.5 to 87.3, extending its losses from
88.7 a week ago.
''Without the increases in interest rates since the previous report
(in November), the Bank's central projection would now have been for
inflation to be in the upper half of the target range,'' the Bank
claimed.
With the benefit of three rate hikes since September the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street is still projecting underlying inflation two years
ahead of around 2.5%, the mid point of the target range -- with the
upside risks somewhat less than before.
''The tightening of monetary policy since November has, therefore,
improved the prospect of achieving the lower half of the target range by
the end of the present Parliament,'' the report concluded.
The upside risks to the inflation target, which had been highlighted
in the November report, had lessened because of the rate rises, Mr
Mervyn King, the Bank's economics director, told the first ever on the
record briefing on the quarterly bulletin.
Otherwise the inflation forecast would have been in the 2.5% to 3%
range.
Mr King offered no guidance on the future path of base rates. ''I
cannot tell you either when or whether they will need to go up again. We
take it one month at a time.''
He warned against getting locked into a pre-planned schedule of
interest rate changes. ''We will now have to see what the next set of
data shows.''
The report took pride in sterling's relative stability, marred in the
last few days, and acknowledged that output growth had fallen from an
annualised rate of well over 4% in the first half of last year to about
3% in the second.
The latest inflation indicators were higher than expected in the
previous report for the first time since the Bank was signed up as the
nation's inflation watchdog after the pound left Europe's exchange rate
mechanism.
Underlying inflation is now expected to rise further over the next six
months and peak at between 3% and 3.5%. Retail price inflation is likely
to pick up as some of the squeeze on retail margins unwinds, the report
said. A weak pound could aggravate the situation.
Mr King said the pound was only one of the factors used by the Bank in
determining monetary policy and denied that any specific targets had
been set for sterling.
The risks to the Bank's two-year inflation forecast remain mainly on
the upside. ''The probability of it being in the lower half of the range
is less than the probability of it being in the upper half,'' the report
said.
The main threats include above trend growth in output, capacity
constraints, especially at export producers, a greater than expected
recovery in retail margins, and an upturn in earnings growth.     Mr
King was concerned about possible upward revisions to the latest output
data as has happened throughout the upswing in activity.
He confirmed that the Government would have to restate its inflation
target this year to take it beyond the life of the present Parliament.
Monetary policy changes take up to two years to affect inflation,
according to the Bank.
The validity of targeting underlying inflation, which excludes only
mortgage interest payments, has been questioned, not least by Bank
economists.
There has been speculation of a switch to a target band of zero to 3%
on a narrower measure, which would also strip out changes in value-added
tax, excise duties, and council taxes.

GAVIN Hastings will lead an unchanged Scotland side in Paris on
Saturday week when the Scots will endeavour to end a 26-year string of
defeats in the French capital.
The selectors, under team manager Duncan Paterson, met for two hours
before naming the same side which defeated both Canada and Ireland.
He said yesterday at a Murrayfield news conference that the decision
to stick with the same combination for three consecutive games -- the
first time since the 1990 Grand Slam season -- had not been a case of
the same personnel ''going through on the nod.''
There had been much discussion about the centre partnership of Ian
Jardine and Gregor Townsend, and about Craig Joiner's berth on the right
wing.
Tony Stanger, of Hawick, and Boroughmuir wing-threequarter Derek Stark
had, he said, come ''very close to selection'' and the selectors had
also noted ''the continuing push'' of Stirling County's Kevin McKenzie
for Ken Milne's slot at hooker.
''However, the feeling at the end of the day was that the side that
played in the last two games had done enough to justify another run.
They showed a lot of character to come back the way they did against
Ireland,'' said Paterson.
Stanger, who has opted at international level for his club berth of
centre after 36 caps on the wing, had been considered for the outside
centre role. The manager said: ''Looking at Stanger in the centre
created further options elsewhere in the back division. I don't intend
going into detail, but there was a fair amount of discussion on that
point.''
Paterson would not be drawn on the implications for both Townsend and
stand-off Craig Chalmers if Stanger had, indeed, been chosen in the
outside centre berth.
However, the likely options would have been discarding Townsend, whose
defence came in for criticism after the Irish game, or playing him at
his preferred position of fly-half in place of Chalmers.
He added: ''By considering outside centre that can have an effect on
the inside centre and, indeed, stand-off. It gives us options.''
Paterson said that the discarded Scott Hastings had also figured in
their calculations but not to the same extent as Stanger or Stark.
So far as the 'A' team captain Kevin McKenzie was concerned, the
manager said that the Stirling County man brought ''presence'' to the
squad and that he too had come ''pretty close'' to promotion from the
bench.
''As selectors, one of the big advantages that we have now compared to
the recent past is that there are players such as Stark and Stanger
pushing for promotion. Kevin McKenzie has been in that category for some
time now. I think his day will come. It just depends when. But, at the
moment, Kenny Milne is holding the place,'' he said.
Later, both Stanger and Stark said that they were heartened by the
fact they were now both back in the selectorial frame.
Stanger, who had a match-winning, two-try performance for the 'A' team
against Ireland last week, declared: ''I would have liked the
opportunity to show what I could do at 'A' level before Friday's game,
but it's nice that I now seem to be in consideration for the full
side.''
Stark said: ''It's good to hear that I seem to have come close. I'm
disappointed that I didn't get back into the side but, hopefully, I'll
be watched in what's left of the club season and it's up to me to keep
producing the goods.'' Team:
Scotland -- A G Hastings (Watsonians), captain; C A Joiner (Melrose),
G P J Townsend (Gala), I C Jardine, K M Logan (both Stirling County); C
M Chalmers, B W Redpath (both Melrose); D I W Hilton (Bath), K S Milne
(Heriots FP), P H Wright (Boroughmuir), D F Cronin (Bourges), S J
Campbell (Dundee HS FP), R I Wainwright (West Hartlepool), E W Peters
(Bath), I R Morrison (London Scottish). Replacements -- I C Glasgow
(Heriot's FP), A G Shiel (Melrose), D W Patterson (West Hartlepool), G W
Weir (Melrose), A P Burnell (London Scottish), K D McKenzie (Stirling
County).
* FRENCH prop Laurent Benezech, who was injured against England on
Saturday, will miss the Five Nations clash with Scotland after having
undergone surgery to repair a detached retina. Laurent Seigne -- his
replacement at Twickenham -- is likely to retain his place.

FOOTBALL fans have never been slow to let managers know it is time to
go, but Ian Miller, who intends to lead a walk-out of St Mirren
supporters on Saturday, yesterday told Jimmy Bone precisely that
face-to-face.
''He said it was nothing personal,'' said Bone who, along with
directors Jackie Copland and Charlie Palmer, asked the rebel leader to a
meeting.
Miller, who anticipates about 1000 people taking part in the protest
during the game against Raith Rovers, confessed that he had been a great
fan of Bone during the manager's playing days with Saints.
''I once ran on to the field to get him to autograph my programme,''
he said, ''but many of us believe that he cannot motivate the players
any more. We understand that the club has no money to buy players, but
we think a new manager would give the team a lift.''
Miller believes that the move is required to make sure that the team
avoids relegation to the second division, a prospect that is an alarming
one for everybody at the club.
Lying in third bottom place at the moment, St Mirren are only three
points ahead of the side holding up the league, Stranraer, and face a
tough battle to survive in the division.
But Bob Earlie, the club's chief executive, made it clear that Bone
does not deserve to be singled out for this treatment, despite the
disappointing results this season.
''Jimmy Bone came here knowing he would get little or no money but I
have every faith in him.''
Earlie and his fellow directors have used their own money to buy John
Boyd of Dumbarton for #30,000, and Bone pointed out that, in all, he
reckons he has spent about #55,000 since he took over three years ago.
''I would guess that with all the players we had to sell, players it is
impossible to replace instantly with youngsters, we took in about
#500,000.''
Earlie expressed his disappointment at the proposed walk-out. ''What
the players need just now is extra help, like they got against Celtic in
the cup. I understand the fans' frustration, but they should know that
when we took over, the club showed a deficit of #880,000 and we had to
make a decision about how to turn that around.
''We brought the figure down to #330,000 in the first year, then to
#150,000, and we hope it will be better again this year. But to do that
we could not allow any money to be used for players.
''Everyone is working very hard to try to bring the club around but,
in the circumstances, it is very difficult.''
Bone, naturally, would prefer to see everybody -- team, board, and
fans -- pulling together, and added: ''There is no-one more frustrated
than me. We have a group of fine young players here, but I am also aware
that we have some players who are not good enough.
''There is no money to change that and we will have to sit tight and
keep working. In the medium to long-term, this club will be all right,
but when you are using young players they find it difficult to find
consistency.''
Neither his promptings, nor those of Palmer and Copland, however, were
able to alter the determination of Miller to carry on with the walk-out.

<HEADLINE>Summer launch for share issue    Aberdeen seek #3m from fans</HEADLINE>

ROY Aitken could be rewarded with #1m to strengthen his squad if he
saves Aberdeen from relegation and the club are successful in a share
issue which they plan to launch in the summer.
The response of Celtic's supporters to their club's recent share issue
has encouraged Aberdeen to offer shares also, although they are not
expecting anything like the #14m which the Glasgow club hope to take in
by the time everyone seeking shares has been satisfied.
The Dons believe they could generate #3m and be able to clear their
debts of #2m, leaving the remainder for Aitken, who will be given a
managerial contract if he succeeds in avoiding relegation, to buy
players.
Willie Miller, sacked on Monday, insisted Aberdeen could not hope to
challenge the Old Firm under the existing financial set-up and to be
competitive changes would have to be made.
Chairman Ian Donald, whose family own the club, admitted: ''Launching
a share issue is an option we will take this summer.
''We had considered doing it earlier this season, but were then
knocked out of Europe by Skonto Riga. This is still not the time to do
it with the way our results have been.
''Celtic had a very successful share launch, but we could not hope to
attract that interest. Realistically, I believe we could raise around
#3m from such a scheme, but this could be done only once, which is a
disadvantage.''
Dealing with Miller's criticisms, he added: ''He said we must spend
big to be successful again, but this club does not generate enough money
to do that. We can create a million-pound player, but we can't afford to
buy one. With average gates of 14,000 that is a fact of life and it will
never change.
''Even when we were winning the European Cup-winners' Cup our crowds
were just 18,000 and attendances have fallen almost everywhere since
then. We must live within our means and every other chairman in
Scotland, apart from the men at Celtic and Rangers, knows he must live
from hand to mouth.''
He then denied reports he would quit because of the decline in
Aberdeen's fortunes and stressed: ''Anyone who suggests this is talking
rubbish and they obviously do not know me. There is no chance of me
walking away.
''When things are going adversely at a club the popular attitude is to
sack the board, but that would solve nothing. Aberdeen football club is
in my blood. It is my life. I am a supporter and if I was not in the
boardroom I would be in one of the stands cheering on the team.
''I am not on an ego trip. I am chairman and spokesman and take the
brunt of public opinion, but we have an excellent board of directors and
we work together as a team. If we go public I will invest heavily again
in the club and if someone comes along who invests more and who can do a
better job then I will stand aside, but I would remain in some
capacity.''
Donald stated the obvious in saying football isn't a money-making
business and that people like Blackburn's Jack Walker are few and far
between. ''We were forced to go into debt for the first time ever to
build the Richard Donald Stand,'' Donald added, ''but that is a
long-term investment for the club which is already starting to make
money.
''We will continue to run this club on prudent lines and not live
beyond our means.''
* CELTIC will be leaned upon to accept the findings of the independent
arbitration tribunal and settle their compensation dispute with
Kilmarnock following the move of manager Tommy Burns and his assistant,
Billy Stark, from the Rugby Park club to Parkhead.
The SFA were playing it cool yesterday following an executive
committee meeting which considered the threat by Celtic not to abide by
any decision. SFA media official David Findlay said: ''The association
will write to the clubs to clarify the situation.''
As the tribunal is an independent body and not a standing committee of
the SFA, the game's ruling body does not want to be seen to be too
involved at this stage.
However, both clubs will have it pointed out to them that they must
abide by the rules of football and that they have, by their membership,
accepted the rules of the SFA which state they must accept decisions.

WILLIE Miller's place in the folklore of Aberdeen will always be
secure, but because of misguided belief on his part -- and an error of
judgement born of desperation within the Pittodrie boardroom -- his
image has been smudged, writes James Traynor.
As a player he attained legendary status, but he failed to take his
greatness from the pitch to the manager's room.
It is unfortunate that someone who had served the club so remarkably
and successfuly as a player should now be associated with a bleak time
as manager, but he ought never have been appointed successor to Alex
Smith in the first place. Chairman Ian Donald and his directors will say
the benefit of hindsight makes every man wiser, but when they dispensed
with the experience of Smith and turned to Miller they were ignoring
sorry precedent. They were flying in the face of statistics which prove
it is almost impossible for a player to make the straight transition to
manager of a top club.
Perhaps Miller's failure will finally convince Aberdeen of this truth,
and if so, they will avoid the same mistake should caretaker manager Roy
Aitken fail to impress enough between now and the end of the season.
Gordon Strachan is being touted strongly, but he has no experience as a
manager.
It would help also if the club and their supporters were to drag
themselves away from the glory years of the 80s. They must realise they
are in a different era, one in which the playing field is not level and
that Alex Ferguson is long gone.
An ability, no matter how great, to organise and influence on the
pitch might offer an indication of potential of managerial abilities,
but it is hardly absolute proof. Aberdeen should have known that much.
After all, they were warned by the man who made way for Miller.
''There are so many different disciplines involved in being the
manager as opposed to being the main player or the captain,'' said
Smith, now in charge at Clyde. ''A manager has to deal with so many
different sets of people, directors, players, supporters, and the media,
and all of these groups see the game in different ways. They require
delicate handling.
''A player could be influential on the pitch, but when he hears his
own voice calling all the shots for the first time it can be another
matter altogether. Also, a young manager can make rash decisions and
perhaps fall out with someone in the boardroom through trying to prove
he is his own man, and all he is really doing is creating a problem for
later on.
''Managing a football club is about many things and it requires
various disciplines. It rarely works when a player is given the job at a
top club because everything he does, his entire learning process, is
analysed, whereas if he started at a smaller club in a lower league he
would be allowed to develop in a less demanding environment.''
It would have been more appropriate a few years ago when Aberdeen's
directors were buckling under the weight of supporters' demands to tell
Miller he was being groomed as the next manager, but that he would have
to work closely with Smith and draw from his experience. At the right
time, when Miller was ready, there could have been a smoother change
over.
''It's strange, but football is the only industry in which a manager
is not properly trained for the job,'' Smith added. ''Too often
directors and chairman are influenced too much by supporters and the
press.
''They always end up thinking that a player, because he displayed
greateness, should automatically become a great manager. The players
themselves always think, 'yes, I can do this,' but it just doesn't work
that way, and you only have to look at the list of those who have failed
to make the transition.''
John Greig suffered at Ibrox even though he won two trophies, Liam
Brady failed to at Celtic Park, Eddie Gray, Alan Clark, Norman Hunter,
Terry Butcher, Tony Fitzpatrick, and now Miller all buckled under the
pressures of managing.
''The ideal way for anyone to go into football management is to work
with someone who has vast experience and knows all the ways and
nuances,'' claims Smith, ''someone who can read players and directors
and get everyone to go along with him. Look at Walter Smith and Archie
Kox. They were schooled properly and are able to handle whatever
problems the game throws up.''
Smith identified narrow vision as another of the game's ills by
stressing that every manager must live in three-match cycles. ''People
don't see that a manager might have his club beautifully structured,
that it could have an excellent youth system, because they deal only in
immediate results.
''The manager is always judged on last week's game, today's match, and
the next one. If results are against him, he is in trouble, yet we find
that things are not equal because it is impossible to compete with the
resources of the Old Firm.
''Other clubs must get back to developing their own players and I
believe we will all return to that age because football canot continue
spending #2m on ordinary players. That can't be sustained. In football
terms Scotland has to be a nation which develops.''

THE leading seeds had mixed passages into the next round of the San
Jose Open tennis tournament yesterday.
Andre Agassi, fresh from his Australian Open title, reeled off the
first eight games en route to a 6-0, 6-2 win over left-hander Fernando
Meligeni, of Brazil, but Michael Chang , the second seed, hit a bumpy
patch in the second set before defeating Chilean Marcelo Rios 6-4, 7-5
in a baseline battle.
Agassi was anxious to get back to business after having taken a week
off following his victory in Melbourne, and was surprised at the way he
dominated Meligeni in just 53 minutes.
''It's tough to beat anybody 6-0, 6-2,'' said Agassi, after having won
57 of 89 points. ''It is surprising. But when you're out there you're
not thinking about how surprising it is, you just continue with your
game plan.''
Chang served well, timed at 124mph, and his unrelenting ground-stroke
game helped him to take the opening set. But the next set was very
different, with the world's sixth-ranked player and Australian Open
semi-finalist falling behind 2-5 to the 19-year-old left-hander before
reeling off the next five games for the victory.
''I played good tennis, not great,'' said Chang. ''I'm hoping as the
week goes on it gets better.''
In other opening-round matches, American Bryan Shelton and Canada's
Greg Rusedski caused the first upsets of the tournament. Shelton
defeated No.4 seed Arnaud Boetsch, of France, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7), while
Rusedski beat seventh-seeded American Richey Reneberg 6-3, 6-4.

SIX of Kingussie's senior shinty players are poised to win an
unprecedented tenth successive north championship title, and while the
silverware is not yet in the bag, this weekend's matches could go a long
way towards resolving two crucial issues.
Kingussie need just three points from their last two games, against
bottom club Beauly, whom they meet at The Dell on Saturday, and Skye. It
is almost inconceivable that Kingussie will slip up, and the six players
who will achieve that unique feat are all scheduled to play -- Michael
Thain, Dave Thomson, Dave Anderson, Ally Dallas, and the Borthwick
brothers, Stephen and David.
The other crucial match tomorrow is the meeting of Lovat and Skye at
Kiltarlity. Both are in the running for national league places next
season and Skye currently have a single-point advantage, having played a
game less. If ever there was a four-pointer, then this is it and the
winners are almost assured of a place.
For the first time, two reserve teams have scooped both Marine Harvest
Club of the Month awards.
Oban Celtic, whose three wins in the period covered by the award
propelled them into second place in division three in the south, receive
#100, and the #50 second prize goes to Beauly's second string, who
hauled themselves off the foot of north division three and into relative
safety.

THE England cricket team's manager, Keith Fletcher, yesterday vowed to
carry on until 1997 and said Mike Atherton should remain as captain as
England's squad flew home after their four-month tour of Australia.
Fletcher was optimistic about the future despite the Ashes demise. ''I
don't think this latest loss puts any extra pressure on me and I can see
some light at the end of the tunnel now,'' he said.
''With the likes of Darren Gough, Devon Malcolm and Angus Fraser, and
with the crop of youngsters coming through like Dominic Cork, Glenn
Chapple and Mark Ilott, we have got the makings of a useful attack.
''What we need now are some batsmen, but with Michael Atherton, Graham
Thorpe, Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash, there is every reason to be
optimistic.''
England have won only five out of 26 Tests -- losing 15 -- since
Fletcher took charge in September, 1992. In addition to losing the Test
series 3-1, they suffered embarrassing one-day defeats against Australia
A, Zimbabwe and the youngsters of the Australian Cricket Academy.
''I would like to see Michael stay on as captain,'' said Fletcher.
''He is the best man for the job in the long term.''
Fletcher also defended the decision to pick veteran batsmen Graham
Gooch and Mike Gatting. ''I am not going to say that with hindsight we
should not have brought them. Hindsight is a brilliant thing but there
was not one person who would have left Graham at home at the start of
the tour,'' said Fletcher.
Meanwhile, the England A team manager, Phil Neale, broke off from
prolonged celebrations in India to tell Atherton: ''If you want players
focused and hungry for success, then come and get this lot.''
Tail-end heroics from Richard Stemp, Richard Johnson and Min Patel
clinched a one-wicket win over India A in the third Test in Chandigarh.
Alan Wells' overjoyed young team promptly went on a Wembley-style lap of
honour -- saluting and blowing kisses to an imaginary crowd in the
near-deserted stadium.
Neale added: ''There is a lot of good talent in India and our success
proves it. But perhaps English players need to appreciate how hard you
have to work for that success. Perhaps some people have had things too
easy.''
India A 229 (R Dravid 59, G Chapple 4-60) and 156 (A A Muzmumbar 55, G
Chapple 5-38), England A 209 (P L K Mhambrey 4-63) and 179-9 (K Singh
4-49, U Chatterjee 4-71). England A won by one wicket.
* PAKISTAN recovered from losing three wickets in 18 balls to paceman
Heath Streak to build an 86-run first innings lead in the second Test
against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.
The tourists, 63 for four after Streak's burst, fought back to reach
260 all out at the close of the second day.

SEVE Ballesteros is looking forward to another successful year after
attending ''a very happy funeral'' in Palm Springs last week.
Ballesteros, who is playing in the Canary Islands Open which begins in
Gran Canaria today, said: ''I spent a week with my coach Mac O'Grady in
Palm Springs, working on my driving and chipping, but particularly on my
short game.
''But the most important thing I did last week was to take an empty
cardboard shoe box, fill it with all the photographs I could find which
showed me swinging badly, and then Mac and I drove out into the desert
and buried the box.
''We buried all my bad habits and I have kept all my good ones. It was
the happiest funeral I have ever attended. Mac and I prayed together, so
maybe I will have a very good year now.''
This week's tournament will be the last European Tour event for
Ballesteros until after the US Masters in April, and he added: ''I
played in Manila two weeks ago. That tournament and the one this week
are just to get a competitive feeling.
''But if I have a chance to win this week, I will take it. I have been
having a little trouble off the tee, but maybe after the funeral all my
drives will be straight.''
Ballesteros intends to have a fortnight's rest after this week before
going to the United States to play in four tournaments in preparation
for the US Masters, which he has won twice.
The 37-year-old Spaniard is currently well ahead in the Ryder Cup
points table, but said he is not worried about the possibility of
dropping down the list. He believes he has almost enough points already
to make the team, and most of his leading rivals also will be
concentrating on American events in the next few weeks.
''The Ryder Cup is not until September and I have four major
tournaments to play before then,'' he said.
Among the Spaniard's main rivals this week will be David Gilford, last
year's winner, Gordon Brand Jr, Darren Clarke, Peter Baker, Sweden's
Joakim Haeggman and fellow Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez.
Ballesteros will play in the first round with Baker and Brand, who,
like the Spanish maestro, has been having problems with his driving.
''Sometimes I can't see the wood for the trees,'' said Brand. ''I've
changed my swing and at the moment it is not going well at all. But I
shall just have to soldier on.''
Brand is joined by nine other Scots in the field -- Dean Robertson,
who finished joint fourth on his European Tour debut last week, Gary
Orr, Adam Hunter, Paul Lawrie, Ross Drummond, Mike Miller, Stephen
McAllister, Craig Ronald, and Brian Marchbank.
* WELSHMAN Simon Defoy, son of Craig, starred with a four-under-par 68
in the second round of the 72-hole Arizona Ping World Pro-Am at
McCormick Ranch in Phoenix, but Scotland's Russell Weir struggled to a
79.
Coombe Hill assistant Defoy, born in 1971, the year his father was
fourth in the Open Championship, vaulted into fourth place while an
out-of-touch Weir -- he had three double bogeys and four-putted once --
slid to fourteenth place, 12 strokes behind Charlie Gibson's
pace-setting total of 140. Leading aggregates (British unless stated):

CROWD trouble at Stamford Bridge marred Millwall's celebration last
night when they progressed to the next round of the FA Cup at the
expense of Chelsea.
John Spencer, so often the hero for Chelsea this season, turned out to
be the villain when he was the only man to miss in a penalty shoot-out
with Millwall at Stamford Bridge, the side from the New Den going
through 5-4 on penalties, setting up a trip to QPR after the London
derby finished 1-1 after extra time.
However, trouble among the fans turned the match sour. Twenty-eight
mounted policemen lined up across the pitch to prevent rival fans
getting at each other.
Millwall manager Mick McCarthy twice came on to the pitch to confront
his own supporters as they spilt over the barriers in jubilation and
police were kept at full stretch dealing with skirmishes around the
ground.
Some seats were ripped up and used as missiles against the police and
at least one rider was unseated from his horse in the jostling.
The post-match scenes obscured a good performance by Millwall, who had
already knocked Arsenal and Nottingham Forest out of cup competitions
this season.
Meanwhile, Norwich struck two goals in five minutes, also in extra
time, to see off Coventry 3-1, and now meet Everton at Goodison, while
in the Midlands, Wolves looked down and out when they went 2-0 down in a
penalty shoot-out with Sheffield Wednesday.
But Graham Taylor's side stuck to their task well, and when
Wednesday's Chris Waddle missed in sudden death, and Don Goodman's shot
hit the back of the net, the home fans went wild with delight, their
team winning 4-3 on penalties after the match ended 1-1 in extra time.
They now meet Leicester at home in the next round.
The only decisive winners were Southampton, who helped themselves to
six goals without reply against Luton.
In Italy, Arsenal manager George Graham was not too despondent despite
the fact that his side were beaten 2-0 in their European Super Cup,
second-leg match against AC Milan.
''They have world-class players,'' said Graham, ''and it was a lesson
to us to see skilful individuals work hard in possession and as a team
when they haven't got the ball.''
Ian Wright had the ball in the net with the London side just one down,
but his strike was disallowed, a decision that mystified Graham. ''Only
the referee can answer the question of why he disallowed it.''
But the manager had no complaints about the result. ''We showed them
too much respect,'' he said. ''We tried to defend in depth but Milan's
forward movement was too good -- in fact, tremendous.''
* AIRDRIE tonight hope to clear the first hurdle as they plan for a
new 10,000 seated stadium on the edge of the town. Monklands District
Council's planning committee will meet to consider the plans for the
Raebog site.
If the plans are accepted, they will then go before a full meeting of
the council and then the regional council. Chairman George Peat said:
''If we get the go-ahead from all the bodies we would be able to start
work quickly.''
* PAUL Ince has been cleared to play for England in next week's Dublin
friendly against Ireland. The Football Association cleared up any doubt
over the availabilty of Ince, who was yesterday arrested and questioned
by South Norwood police investigating the Eric Cantona incident at
Selhurst Park.
* THE Italian Senate, galvanised by the fatal stabbing of a fan last
month, yesterday approved a series of measures aimed at curbing violence
at football matches.
Under a decree, which now goes to the Chamber of Deputies for
definitive approval, police can bar from stadiums hardline, or so-called
'ultra,' fans who have been accused or convicted of violence. These fans
are also required to sign a police register, making it easier for
authorities to keep track of them.

JULIE Ewart, of Forfar, had a convincing win in the opening round of
the Bank of Scotland Junior Curling Championships at Kilmarnock's
Galleon Centre last night, by 12-3 over Hamilton's Lesley Stobo.
Also starting out on the victory trail was Greenacres' Fiona Brown
who, after the first few tight ends, never looked in trouble against the
Perth rink skipped by Sharon Stewart and eventually won by 8-3.
The other two matches in the women's section were much tighter.
Lockerbie's Alison Meechan misjudged the weight of her last stone to let
Catherine Wright, of Stranraer, in at the end of the game for an 8-7
win, while Kinross's Sheila Swan was too heavy with her last stone and
lost by 7-6 against Ayr's Kirsty Drummond.
While the women's games went with the form book, there were surprises
in the opening round of men's games which followed.
Holder and 1993 world junior champion Craig Wilson, of Lockerbie, went
down 5-3 to Tom Brewster's team, also from Lockerbie, while James
Dryburgh of Aviemore -- another former world junior champion -- lost by
the same score to David Mundell of Greenacres.
Chris Hildrey of Murrayfield got off to a flying start, scoring a 4 at
the second end, but his opponent, Ross MacKay of Gogar Park, clawed his
way back to win 7-6.
Lee McLeary, of Kinross, scored singles at each of the first four ends
to against David Gladstone's team from Stranraer on his way to a 7-3
triumph.

MORAY Hanson has not had his troubles to seek recently as Edinburgh
Racers have leaked goals at an alarming rate. Britain's most decorated
ice hockey club side lost 20 last weekend and Hanson admitted: ''It's
got to stop.''
The Great Britain internationalist, one of 40 players on standby for
the world championships in Slovak Republic in mid-April, still believes
Racers have the firepower to lift the season's last remaining national
title -- the British championship -- but only if they get things
together at the back.
Racers' hold on the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup was released by eventual
winners Nottingham Panthers, who also are odds-on to take the premier
division title.
Hanson, however, is convinced Racers can lift the sports blue riband.
''We've thrown in the towel as far as the league is concerned, because
we're 11 points behind Nottingham and they have two games in hand,'' he
said.
''What we've got to do is find some consistency going into the
play-offs at the end of the regular season. We've proved we can beat the
best, and if we can get to the play-offs looking strong, then there are
only a handful of games we've got to win to go all the way.
''If we can work things out, then we can win at Wembley. We have the
firepower to cut down any side, but we can't continue to leak goals.''
Racers received a boost last night when defenceman Mike Ware's gross
misconduct penalty, picked up at Nottingham last Saturday, was wiped out
by Britain's referee supervisor Nico Toemen.
Meanwhile, Canadian Peter Woods, currently coaching in Sweden, looks
set to be named as Great Britain coach later this week, replacing former
Murrayfield favourite Alex Dampier.
* JOE Mullen scored two goals and made two assists to became the first
American-born player in National Hockey League history to reach 1000
career points as unbeaten Pittsburgh beat Florida 7-3.

CITY of Glasgow will carry Scotland's hopes in the British Club Team
Swimming Championships in Stockport next month. Victory in the women's
event, and second place in the men's, at last weekend's Scottish
championships convinced coach Dave Bance that a trip south would be
worthwhile.
''Competing at home is too predictable,'' he contended. ''The swimmers
need to get into England and take on people they don't know. Taking part
in the club championships will be a good opportunity to develop better
team spirit within the club.''
Milngavie and Bearsden, who won the Scottish men's event, have decided
to forego the Stockport meet, but Bance also recognises it as a chance
to boost the high-level competition experience for those with European
championships in their sights.
Fraser Walker, Alison Sheppard, and Euan Stewart all will be targeting
the senior European trials in the middle of April, while Craig Miller is
a contender to earn a first British cap at the European junior event in
Geneva in July.
This weekend, Miller will be aiming to boost his credentials when he
competes for Scotland in the Welsh Dragon Meet in Cardiff.
In Edinburgh on Saturday, David Wilkie, the 1976 Olympic champion,
will be a special guest at the Royal Bank of Scotland Scottish Schools'
championships at the Royal Commonwealth Pool.
Wilkie, who is involved with the Scottish Schools' Award Scheme, will
be presenting trophies, and his presence will be an inspiration for the
1200 youngsters taking part.
In the senior section, former British youth cap Kirsty Hope (Dundee
High), is favourite in the 100m free-style, while Tracy Porter (Mackie
Academy) and Laura Mercer (Dunfermline High) have their sights set on
breaking records in the 17-19 years 100m butterfly and 100m back-stroke
respectively.

GEORGE Foreman, the veteran world heavyweight boxing champion, will
defend the title against German Axel Schulz in Las Vegas on April 22.
''The fight is firmly in the bag,'' the American told a German
television station. ''Now everything is official.''
Foreman, who holds the World Boxing Association and International
Boxing Federation versions of the title, was in danger of losing his WBA
crown for fighting Schulz instead of its highest-ranked available
contender.
But, following a telephone call with his financial adviser Henry
Holmes, the 46-year-old American said: ''The final approval is now only
a formality. After days of to-ing and fro-ing, this is great news for
me.''
Foreman has been visiting Germany in the last few days at the
invitation of the television station.
Meantime, 33-year-old James Oyebola will prepare and learn under the
supervision of America's Tommy Brooks -- one time co-trainer of former
world champion Evander Holyfield -- at Great Gorge, New Jersey, before
returning to defend the British title next month.
Oyebola undoubtedly has the power, but currently is too one-paced and
predictable, as was shown before he caught up with Californian
substitute Keith McMurray in the seventh round at the Ipswich Corn
Exchange last week.

PROBLEMS with his irons cost Kevin Anderson the chance of two winners
and an interview with the stewards at Alnwick, but the Dumfriesshire
rider hopes for better luck at the Haydon point-to-point on Saturday.
Anderson's stirrup leathers came adrift after he was struck into on
Givower in the restricted race and, as a result, he was forced to pull
up.
Worse was to come in the open race in which he rode Jimmy River, a 1-6
shot bidding for his eighth consecutive victory in point-to-points.
The pair were handily placed approaching the fourteenth when the
leather parted from the stirrup again, and Anderson had no option but to
pull up. The race was won by 33-1 chance Mandika, and Anderson's
explanation was accepted by officials.
Andrew Parker had his first success of the season in the confined on
the Berwickshire horse, Royal Stream. He also was placed in two of the
maiden races, while the ladies open went to Pauline Robson on Minibrig,
another from Berwickshire.
On the new point-to-point course inside the perimeter of Hexham
racecourse on Saturday, Jimmy River will attempt to repeat last season's
success when he beat Royal Jester.
This time the opposition could be stiffer as the entries include
13-year-old Generals Boy, who beat him by five lengths in a hunter chase
at Ayr in April.
Also in the field is Gunmetal Boy, winner at the Buccleuch meeting
last season.

HE is, without doubt, the most talented male endurance runner in
Scotland. But if Tom Hanlon were a horse, you would not bet on him.
An enigma in Scottish athletics, he ranks among the world's leading
steeplechasers year after year, far ahead of any other Scottish track or
road endurance man.
With such a pedigree, including sixth in the Olympics, the surprise is
that Hanlon has not dominated the national cross-country championship as
did Nat Muir, with eight senior wins in the decade before him.
Yet Hanlon has just one such victory to his credit, in 1991 -- a
spectacular, runaway win at Dundee. But even then his clubmates had to
drag the reluctant Hanlon from bed on the day of the race and persuade
him to run.
He is downbeat about his prospects of a second title on Sunday, when a
total of 2155 athletes from 85 clubs line up at the North Inch, Perth.
''Last year I was in great shape,'' he said. ''I'd just returned from
Kenya, but turned out when I should not have -- just to help the team. I
dropped out after a lap and half. I was incubating flu. The two years
before that, I was injured. The important thing this year is to run a
canny race, to count as high as I can.''
His club, Leslie Deans Racing, is trying to stop an eighth successive
senior team win by Cambuslang in a race which carries the additional
reward of places in Britain's world championship trials.
The first six men and five women in their respective races will
automatically be sent to the trial at Druridge Park, Northumberland, on
March 5. There will only be one trial place in each team at the
selectors' discretion.
''I'm probably not a contender this weekend,'' said Hanlon. ''I've had
the odd problem over the winter -- cold, calf and Achilles niggles --
but since Christmas things have picked up.
''My priority is to start the track season without losing any more
training. Each winter I've had problems, and it's been well into the
summer before I've been in any shape at all.''
Despite that, he reached the most recent Olympic and world finals, a
claim which none of Sunday's rivals can make.
His talent is so great that he can lift his fitness dramatically
within weeks. His English coach sends schedules by post. ''Sometimes,
you wonder if he uses them only as a coaster,'' said one of several
clubmates who envy his ability and are frustrated that he can improve so
dramatically on seemingly gentle training.
Hanlon's best track summer followed his Scottish cross-country title.
He lost count of the number of times he broke the national steeplechase
record. But then he was tackling 15-mile sessions with his mates, Alan
Robson and London Marathon winner, Alastair Hutton.
These sessions are over, though Hutton, the 1982 champion, is making a
return at these championships, in LDRC colours.
* SALLY Gunnell has a heel injury and has withdrawn from Saturday's
Great Britain v France international at the Kelvin Hall, leaving City of
Glasgow's Mel Neef as British No.1. A replacement has yet to be named.
Changes announced yesterday were: Sarah Oxley for Marcia Richardson
(200m), Debbie Gunning for Alison Wyeth (3000m), and Vicky Schofield for
Yinka Idowu (long jump). But the presence of stars such as Linford
Christie, Colin Jackson, and John Regis yesterday secured the
sponsorless meeting a backer, Interflora.

BOGOTA, Wednesday
A STRONG earthquake shook cities and towns across western Colombia
today, reportedly killing at least 27 people, injuring more than 200 and
destroying dozens of houses and offices, radio reports said.
The quake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale, was the most deadly in
Colombia for more than two decades.
It sent office workers in the capital Bogota running out into the
streets in panic but the death and destruction was concentrated in the
industrial and coffee-processing city of Pereira, 90 miles to the west.
Police General Carlos Alberto Pulido Barrantes, speaking from national
police headquarters in Bogota, said 20 people had been officially
reported dead, 11 of them in Pereira, but radio reports put the toll at
more than 27.
RCN Radio, using reporters on the spot to count victims, said 20
people died in Pereira alone and more than 85 had been injured, many of
them seriously. Nationwide, 217 people were injured and 27 dead in six
provinces, it added.
Barrantes said the quake badly damaged or destroyed more than 60
buildings in Pereira, including the provincial government building, a
college, banks, a police station and offices.
Police and military chiefs immediately declared a state of emergency
and ordered helicopters and Army transports to airlift food, medicine
and rescue workers to the quake zone.
''This is a horrible, lamentable event,'' Health Minister Alonso Duque
told reporters as he boarded a flight to the disaster area.
Residents of Pereira, a city of about 300,000 people, told how water
leaped out of swimming pools, tiles fell off roofs and huge cracks
opened up in the walls of offices and homes as the quake rocked the town
at 1.43pm local time.
Television pictures showed rescue workers and bystanders frantically
tugging at pieces of walls and chunks of concrete in the tangled
wreckage in a desperate search for victims. A boy was pulled from the
debris.
A firefighter, his yellow slicker smudged with dirt, gently cradled
the boy in his arms and carried him away.
TV images showed a highway overpass buckled by the quake, the body of
a man lying on it.
Electricity supplies were cut off and the city's telephone network
collapsed as the quake hit, witnesses said.
Pereira officials said they cut electrical power in the city of
700,000 to avoid fires from possible gas leaks or downed power lines.
Residents were urged to buy flashlights and candles.
''We watched as part of the facade of the newspaper building cracked
up and crashed down to the street,'' Rosmira Corro, news editor at the
Pereira newspaper La Tarde, said in a telephone interview. ''People here
are terrified.''
Rescue workers said four of Pereira's dead were a family buried alive
under a landslide in a hilly city street. Other victims, including a
16-year-old girl in a southern city, died of heart attacks brought on by
the terror of the quake.
Mayor Juan Manuel Arango clamped a curfew over the city centre and
drafted in extra police and soldiers to prevent looting. Hospitals in
Bogota organised emergency airlifts of donor blood to the quake zone.
Pereira is located in the heart of Colombia's coffee growing and
processing area. Colombia is the world's second biggest coffee exporter
but exporters in Bogota said they did not believe that the quake would
seriously affect crops.
In June 1994, a 6.4-magnitude quake triggered landslides which buried
several villages along the Nevado del Huila volcano south of Bogota,
killing at least 1109 people.--REUTER

Copenhagen, Wednesday
FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd and Faroese leaders said today they
hoped for a negotiated settlement over a boundary row between the Faroe
and Shetland Islands which is blocking oil exploitation.
''We emphasised our desire and hope for a negotiated settlement,''
said Mr Hurd after a meeting in Copenhagen with Faroese Prime Minister
Edmund Joensen.
''This was the first political meeting during the course of
negotiations about the boundary. We exchanged political views and the
gap between us has narrowed,'' Mr Joensen said.
Talks began in 1991 between Denmark, which is responsible for Faroese
foreign policy, and Britain over the demarcation line between the two
groups of islands in the North Atlantic.
Before today they had been conducted solely by diplomats.
Until the boundary is agreed companies cannot obtain licences to
exploit large oil reserves which are believed to be in the area.
There have been signs that patience is beginning to run out and that
the matter would end in a long trial before the International Court of
Justice in The Hague.
Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said last month that he
would not give in to British demands, but a joint statement today made
it clear both sides still aimed for a compromise.
The next round of talks will take place in London on February 21 and
more sessions are scheduled in the spring.
BP said in 1993 that it had struck oil worth an estimated #6.6 billion
just 13[1/2] miles from the Faroese fishing limit.
The Faroese are believed to be insisting on a demarcation line halfway
between the two groups of islands, but British officials say this would
give the Faroes an enormous area out of proportion to its own size.
HAVANA: Cuban leader Fidel Castro said he was encouraged by prospects
for closer business links with Britain after two meetings with Baroness
Young.

five-day visit that Cuba was on a path of economic change.--Reuter.

Houston, Wednesday
BRITISH shuttle astronaut Michael Foale was busy today inspecting the
bulky suit he will wear during a five-hour spacewalk tomorrow morning.
Lincolnshire-born Dr Foale, 38, who emigrated to the United States in
1982 to become an astronaut, will be joined outside the shuttle
Discovery by Bernard Harris, the first black man to walk in space.
As they double-checked their spacesuits today, the other four shuttle
crew inspected 20 scientific experiments in a space laboratory.
Before tomorrow's walk the crew is to retrieve an ultra-violet
telescope released yesterday. The telescope is focused on interstellar
gas and dust that eventually will form new stars and planetary systems.
Discovery is flying about 35 miles behind the telescope during its two
days of free flight.
The spacewalk in Discovery's vast cargo bay will see Foale and Harris
practise lifting the one-and-a-quarter-ton telescope.
Nasa also wants to evaluate changes intended to make the spacesuits
''warmer''. The two spacewalkers, stationed on the end of the 50ft
shuttle crane, will remain idle in the frigid darkness of Discovery's
shadow for up to half-an-hour to see just how cold they become.
''I think I may get as cold as shivering, but not beyond that -- where
you stop shivering,'' Foale joked.
When the United States, Russia, and other countries start building an
international space station in 1997, spacewalking astronauts will face
long periods without the warmth of direct sunlight.
Discovery's eight-day flight ends on Saturday.--AP.

Cape Town, Wednesday
ANTI-APARTHEID cleric Allan Boesak and his staff were today accused of
getting rich on money given by foreign charities.
Donors from Nordic countries said they had enriched themselves
''substantially'' from money intended to help the victims of South
Africa's former apartheid policy.
Boesak is accused among other things of spending aid funds on his
wedding reception, but he bitterly denounced a meeting with donors'
representatives as a ''farce'' and laimed he was not allowed to defend
himself against the allegations.
''I speak with anger in my heart today, I speak with a lot of hurt,''
he said. ''I have spent most of my life fighting for the liberation of
the people. I have found that the justice I have fought for is not for
me.''
The donors said Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice had given
him and other staff loans of more than #400,000 over five years.
''The loans were used by the recipients for their own benefit. Only
very limited efforts to repay the loans have been made,'' said DanChurch
Aid, the Church of Norway's Council of Foreign Relations, the Olof Palme
International Centre, and the Swedish International Development Agency.
They said an investigation by lawyers concluded that the trustees of
the FPJ ''acquitted themselves of their duties to account, to supervise,
and to avoid conflict of interests in a way that is characterised as
'astounding'.''
''The findings also indicate that employees of the foundation,
including its director (Boesak), have enriched themselves substantially
at the expense of the foundation,'' the group added.
The aid donors warned that if the FPJ gave no satisfactory response
they would start criminal proceedings.
A furious Boesak, South Africa's ambassador-designate to the United
Nations in Geneva, told a Cape Town news conference: ''I believe this
report is a travesty of justice.'' He branded the Scandinavians
''arrogant and in contempt of what we are trying to do''.
Meanwhile the groups who gave the aid cash said Boesak had told
investigating lawyers that his monthly income of more than #4000 was
justified on merit.
''Among the queries raised in the investigation are payments in
respect of the settlement of Mrs Boesak's debts, the purchase of Dr
Boesak's house and the renovations thereof, Dr Boesak's extensive travel
budget, and his wedding reception.
''The donors have not found the explanations given satisfactory,''
their statement said.
Boesak, 49, headed the Geneva-based World Alliance of Reformed
Churches for eight years until 1990, when he was forced to resign over a
sex scandal involving a white television producer who is now his wife.
He and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu were among the main spokesmen
for South Africa's black majority during five years of emergency rule
that ended in 1990.
Boesak headed the campaign of President Nelson Mandela's African
National Congress in the Cape Town area in last year's first all-race
elections, but failed to win election himself as a provincial premier.
On Monday Tutu asked police to investigate the disappearance of
#80,000 donated by American singer Paul Simon to his Children's Trust in
1988 and administered by Boesak's FPJ.--Reuter.

Ottawa, Wednesday
CANADA'S new governor general took office today, but questions about
his tax-free salary, patronage, and the role of the monarchy have
tarnished the image of the Queen's personal representative.
Former Liberal politician Romeo LeBlanc, 67, swore allegiance to the
Queen as head of state in a lavish ceremony to become the nation's 25th
governor general.
''Your career is an example of devoted public service and a source of
inspiration to all who live in this country,'' said Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, who picked LeBlanc for the job.
However LeBlanc came under criticism before he took office for his
close ties to the Liberal party and for his tax-free salary.
The respected newspaper columnist Allan Fotheringham wrote about the
appointment of LeBlanc: ''Just as the goofy Royals are killing off the
monarchy with their bulimic excesses, the Prime Minister's Office makes
laughable its latest pork appointment to what used to be a respected
position in our firmament.''
The Globe and Mail newspaper listed LeBlanc among other Liberals who
have received prominent jobs since the party swept to power in late
1993.
''It still pays to know the party in power in Ottawa,'' the newspaper
said.
In a rare attack against a governor general in Parliament, the
right-wing opposition Reform Party yesterday challenged his tax-free
status.
''Now that the Queen pays income tax, why shouldn't her representative
in Canada do so?'' asked Deborah Grey, a Reform Party member.
Chretien said the Canadian Government might review the tax-free
status. However pressure is building since the government is planning to
axe thousands of jobs and cut spending to bring down Canada's huge
budget deficit.
The role of governor general, which is a highly ceremonial one of
approving laws and meeting foreign dignitaries, also brings with it many
perks, including a large residence and a huge staff.
Last year, anti-poverty groups blasted the outgoing envoy Ramon
Hnatyshyn for spending an estimated #76,000 flying to and from the
United States.
Hnatyshyn was later roundly criticised for using a government Airbus
A-310 to fly to Brussels in March at a cost of about #66,000.
Ties between Canadians and the Crown are waning, with opinion polls
showing most Canadians favour severing ties with what is seen by many as
an anachronistic institution.
Reform Party leader Preston Manning told reporters that his party has
recieved a great deal of support through letters, faxes, and phone calls
since it began to speak out against LeBlanc's appointment.
LeBlanc, born in 1927, worked as a teacher and a foreign correspondent
for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He later served as press
secretary to former Liberal Prime Ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre
Trudeau.
He was Minister of fisheries and public works. In 1984, he was
appointed to the Senate, where party favourites are often sent.--Reuter.

Grozny, Wednesday
CHECHEN rebels moved more men into Grozny today to meet fresh Russian
attacks.
Truckloads of fighters arrived from Gudermes in the south and headed
off towards the main bus station, where rebels reported clashes with the
Russians.
However the Chechens have decided to withdraw their military
headquarters from the devastated capital, an aide to Chechen leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev said tonight.
''A decision was taken to move the headquarters of the armed forces
outside Grozny,'' said Movladi Udugov. ''Special assault groups will
remain in the city. They have the task of waging military activities
there.''
He did not say when the fighters were planning to abandon Grozny,
which has been largely reduced to rubble by eight weeks of Russian
bombing and fierce street fighting.
Chechen military commander Aslan Mashkhadov said the plan was to hold
out in Grozny until the end of winter, then move to mountain bases.
''The Russian troops in Chechnya will feel more and more strongly our
resistance,'' he warned.
The Russian Government said that its forces were pushing deeper into
western and south-eastern parts of the city and were not meeting much
resistance.
A Russian commander in Grozny said earlier that he was now ready to
withdraw his men as planned to allow Interior Ministry troops, who have
no artillery or tanks, to police the wrecked city.
SEOUL: Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said on a visit to South
Korea that Russians no longer supported President Boris Yeltsin and
urged him to quit. ''The Chechnya incident has damaged not only Grozny
but the entire republic,'' Gorbachev said.--Reuter.

Athens, Wednesday
A TURKISH F-16 warplane crashed into the Aegean sea today after Greece
said it entered Greek airspace and scrambled fighters to drive it off.
The pilot parachuted to safety.
An Athens air force spokesman said the plane had violated Greek air
space in the eastern Mediterranean and crashed because of pilot error.
No shots were fired.
In Ankara, a Turkish military spokesman said the plane was on a
training flight in international air space when it crashed owing to a
technical error.
The pilot was picked up by the Greek Coast Guard after 30 minutes in
the water, the Greek spokesman said. He was treated for shock at a
Rhodes hospital, he added.
The plane crashed as pilot Mustafa Yildirim turned to go back to the
nearby Turkish coast. He was later flown home from Rhodes in a Greek
military plane, escorted by the Turkish consul in Rhodes, a Greek
doctor, and a Greek Air Force officer, the Defence Ministry in Athens
said.
In Ankara, officials played down the latest crisis between arch-rivals
Greece and Turkey.
''I don't believe the incident to be of a magnitude to increase
tension in Greece-Turkey relations,'' said Foreign Minister Murat
Karayalcin.
A Turkish military spokesman said: ''The crash occurred 15 miles
south-west of Rhodes while the plane was in international airspace.''
However the Greek spokesman put the interception 10 miles south of
Rhodes and said it was ordered after four Turkish F-16s had violated
Greek airspace for a second time yesterday.

HOUSE prices in the Aberdeen area are continuing to outstrip the rest
of the country, and last year rose more than 3% faster than the rest of
Scotland.
They went up by 4.7% to an average of almost #71,000, while the
average Scottish price rose 1.5% to #57,700 last year and throughout the
UK the rise was 0.5% to an average of #62,750.
The annual survey, by the Aberdeen Solicitors' Property Centre and
Grampian Regional Council, shows the market is remaining buoyant
although the rate of price increase is slowing.
The highest prices of more than #100,000 were in Kingswells, Lower
Deeside, and Banchory/Durris, while the lowest prices of less than
#60,000 were in Bucksburn, Bankhead, and Stoneywood.
After suffering a drop in 1986 and 1987 in the wake of the oil price
slump, prices in the Aberdeen area have risen steadily.
They are now 13% above the UK figure, but the gap has narrowed since
1983 when the difference was 21%.
Since 1983 Aberdeen prices have risen by 90% as opposed to 103% in the
UK, and over the same period the Retail Price Index has climbed 50%.
Mr Malcolm Shepherd, ASPC vice-chairman, said: ''The rate at which
property prices in the Aberdeen area are increasing has slowed down a
little, but at almost 5% higher than a year ago the market remains in
good shape, particularly when compared with the figure for the whole of
Britain.''
During last year the ASPC handled 5690 sales in the area worth more
than #403m.
At the end of the year there were 1622 properties on its register,
which is a 41% increase on the previous year and the highest since 1989.
This reflects the fact that homes take longer to sell.

A SCOTTISH judge was asked yesterday to decide whether a 71-year-old
widow should be allowed to visit her 15 grandchildren in this country.
Mrs Azizan Bibi was refused permission by immigration authorities to
spend a two months' holiday in Glasgow with her eldest son, Faqir
Mohammed, a licensed grocer who was sponsoring his mother's first visit
to the UK.
Mr Peter Macdonald, advocate, claimed at the Court of Session,
Edinburgh, that the decision was ''unreasonable''.
Mr Macdonald said: ''Mr Mohammed, in his evidence to the immigration
authorities, said his mother would definitely go back at the end of the
visit.''
Mr Macdonald argued that Mrs Bibi wanted to be near her late husband's
tomb and wished to die where she had spent most of her life.
The judge, Lord Kirkwood, was asked to allow Mrs Bibi's appeal, which
also has the backing of the Council of British Pakistanis (Scotland).
Miss Susan O'Brien, advocate for the Scottish Secretary, who is
opposing Mrs Bibi's appeal, will begin her case today.

SAYING it with flowers on St Valentine's Day may still be romantic but
in the hi-tech 90s the gift of a mobile phone has become the latest way
to his or her heart. Giving a mobile phone has never been so popular
with the two largest service providers, Vodafone and Cellnet, adding
over a quarter of a million new subscribers in December alone.
Giving mobile phones divides equally between the sexes although,
according to Joanne Arden of Woodend Communications Queen Street branch
''there tend to be slightly more men than women giving phones to their
wives or girlfriends. But, really, we find that, with the cost so low,
almost anyone can afford them nowadays.''
There are four operators who provide the networks for using mobile
phones in the UK. They are Vodafone, Cellnet, Mercury One-2-One, and
Hutchison Orange. When you buy your phone from a dealer you will be
linked to one of these four service providers who will bill you monthly
for the rental, the issuing of itemised statements and the details of
call charges.
The phones themselves are manufactured by a wide range of familiar
companies including BT, Nokia, Phillips, NEC, Sony, Mitsubishi, and
Motorola and then retailed through general electrical chains such as
Dixons or Comet or through mobile phone specialists such as DX Modile
Phone Centres (the UK Cellnet dealer of the year in 1994), Woodend
Communications, Martin Dawes Communications etc.
Choosing which operator and then which phone you want can be daunting.
There are two main criteria for selecting which operator: the charges
and the availability of the system. The tariffs for mobile phones can be
bewildering but the general rule is that if you intend to use your phone
for a lot of calls then you should select the business service which has
a cheaper monthly rental charge but a lower call charge. Typically
monthly rental of #25 and charges of 25p peak and 10p off peak per
minute as opposed to the non-business user which has a monthly rental of
#14 but call charges of 42.5p peak and 17p off peak per minute.
If you intend using the phone for more than 10 minutes per week then
the business tariff tends to work out more cheaply. Orange are the only
operator who bill you by the second rather than in minute blocks which
again can make a difference to the bill at the end of each month.
Connection charges to each of the operators tend to fluctuate
according to deals available at any one time. Sometimes connection is
free while at other times it can be between #30-#60.
The first mobile phones that were produced tended to be large, clumsy
heavy items which didn't really fit in your pocket and didn't really
look attractive. The latest models are designed beautifully, are light,
and easy to carry and use. The world's smallest mobile phone at the
moment is the Sony CM-R111 which weighs just 185g and is tiny. This was
available at DX recently for just #59.
The Ericsson phone was voted mobile phone of the year last year and
there are a number of features to look out for in selecting your mobile.
Name and number memory (usually around 99 numbers), the length of talk
time available (this ranges between 60 to 100 minutes), and how often
you need to charge the batteries (every 18-20 hours for the Ericsson,
14-16 hours for the rest).
Most mobile phones are now very light, easy to carry and look good
making them, for some, a very desirable fashion accessory. The cost of
buying a mobile phonbe varies wildly from about #40 up to, and in excess
of, #350. You may be wondering why this is so and it is because of the
margins the dealers are offered and the commission they make from the
operators for gaining new subscribers. The operators say that they
expect the annual costs of a mobile phone to be around #265 with a
business user nearer #700 so they obviously want as many customers as
possible and are willing to provide as many incentives to mobile phone
dealers as they can to get sales. The result, for the customer, is that
mobile phones, which generally cost around #180, are being sold for
half, or even a quarter of their real value.
Aside from their fashionable and aesthetic appeal they also have to
work. The original Analogue system was begun in 1985 and this now
encompasses most of the UK and Europe. This offers the most
accessibility and biggest geographic spread of any of the systems.
However it is now a secure system, as those involved in the ''squidgy''
tapes know! Had they been using the latest Digital system their
conversation would have been entirely secret since Digital does not
allow for others overhearing or being able to listen in on
conversations.
The Analogue still has around 15 years of its contract to run and it
is likely to remain the most popular system in the foreseeable future.
Digital offers a clearer reception and is more restricted in its
availablility but is likely to be the system of the future. Digital
tends to be best in urban areas and in the central belt of Scotland
which is fine if that's where you need it but if you are going to
require your phone outwith these areas then you should think about
analogue.
Analogue also suffers from cloning whereby another mobile phone user
can get a hold of your line details and then use your phone number for
their own calls charging them to your monthly bill. Again Digital has
the advantage in this area with a security smart card available which
prevents other people from discovering your details.
Mobile phones have never been cheaper, lighter, as easy to use or as
accessible to as many people and seem likely to remain at the top of the
gift list for some time.
In the hi-tech 90s giving a mobile phone has never been so popular and
has become the latest way to his or her heart

THE award-winning Rouken Glen Garden Centre in Eastwood celebrates its
10th birthday this month by opening a new outdoor undercover area
totalling some 20,000sq ft of garden display space.
A fully glazed roof protects the entire area from the elements. More
than 100 tons of concrete slabs were laid to provide the floor, now
filled by a bright blaze of colours and greenery as the three Sheikh
brothers who run the garden centre in partnership also mark its 10th
birthday with a special celebration ''earlybird'' sale aimed at garden
enthusiasts everywhere.
''We began work to create the new undercover area in August last
year,'' said Mr Mohammed Akram, one of the three brothers. ''Finishing
the task is another big step forward in our overall development plan for
here.
The next stage ahead will complete the job of giving us the first
fully covered garden centre in Scotland. The new development, which
doubles the space we now have under cover, offers shelter to customers
whatever the weather. But it is more than a convenience factor. Although
plants are also sheltered by the glass overhead, they are otherwise
still in the open for healthy natural growth to which we can add
benefits like controlled watering. It means that the flowers and plants
are offered in top quality and in best possible conditions.
The new chapter to be added to the green success of the Rouken Glen
Garden Centre story is the latest in a history which began when the
Sheikh brothers, who came to Scotland from Kenya some 20 years ago,
first obtained a lease of ground at Rouken Glen these 10 years ago when
the parkland became the property of Eastwood District Council.
Steady development and investment resulted in what began as a modest
garden centre building of 5000sq ft eventually expanding to cover more
than 35,000 sq ft.
It now offers parking for 400 vehicles. A recent #100,000 building
programme aimed at creating an all weather centre to attract gardening
families of all ages. It is busy seven days a week and has a tearoom
which seats 140 customers.
''We count our customers in thousands every weekend, many coming from
a considerable distance beyond Glasgow. Like the rest of the garden
centre, the new undercover outdoor area has been designed to offer total
access to disabled visitors. That includes reserve parking, walkway
ramps, and toilets.''
Rouken Glen operates two other garden centres at Barnton in Edinburgh
and at Linlithgow.
''That gives us a particular strength when it comes to buying at keen
prices and we are able to pass on major savings to customers. That fact
is reflected in this year's sale offer prices. In most cases they match
special sale prices last year and in some cases are even below those
prices.''
The Sheikh brothers have lorryloads of fresh supplies of plants and
shrubs arriving daily from places as far apart as the north of Scotland
and the south of England. Other lines are selected imports from all over
the world. That may mean the bright colours of large displays of
everlasting silk flowers -- ''they are at 20% off marked prices, and if
they ever get dusty you just wash them'' -- to a wide range of
fashionable cane furniture for conservatory use, general garden
furniture in wood or plastic, barbecue equipment and, direct from Italy,
a large selection of terracotta pots of all sizes.
''One of the things we have set out to do is to make a visit to the
centre a full day out experience for the family. As part of that, our
Butterfly Kingdom opens for another season in March. Our pets
department, run by Tracy Morrison, and which doubled in size last year,
features a number of small animals to delight children. It also stocks a
wide range of outdoor and indoor fish along with pond and aquarium
sundries and has one of the largest stocks of pet foods and accessories
in the West of Scotland.''
The Rouken Glen Garden Centre experts say that more Scottish families
now spend more time than ever in their home gardens. Scots, they say,
are particularly attracted by flowers and colour. Plants in bloom are
always top choices with vegetables lagging far behind.
The Sheikh brothers admit that it took a lot of hard work to build up
the Rouken Glen Garden Centre to its present prize-winning status in the
horticultural world, where ''the boys from Rouken Glen'' are regarded as
total professionals throughout the UK.
They sum up their present celebrations by saying: ''We are murdering
our prices on our 10th anniversary!''
That covers everything from plants to conifers and flowering trees,
from composts to plant foods.
But now something new is stirring as a possible plan for the near
future. They are exploring the possibility of establishing Scotland's
first ostrich farm. That they agree would be something different.

THIS is a time of year when gardeners everywhere feel starved of
colour -- the colour in rich profusion which the Rouken Glen Garden
Centre prides itself in providing.
''After the kind of winter we have had, flowering colour is at the top
of most people's lists,'' said Brian Cullie, outdoor sales manager.
A professionally qualified horticulturist, he backs that belief with
swathes of colour which begin with a display of more than 1000 winter
flowering heathers in 12 different varieties. They are flanked by long
bright lines of pansies.
''There are other flowering plants we sell by the thousands each year,
including mallows, which have a large single flower, forest frees --
small cheerful plants with a red flowering top -- and the always popular
begonias and dahlias.
''Polyanthus, rhododendrons and azaleas and many others can now be
seen to a new advantage in our undercover outdoor area, which surrounds
a large central courtyard where bright colours are again strongly
featured.''
Gardening fashion can change, and Brian Cullie cites as one current
example the fashion for ''family'' apple trees. These are space saving,
producing three different types of apple which pollinate one another and
steadily increasing sales show their popularity for the smaller garden.
''They are also excellent value at around the #25 mark. Smaller house
gardens, with families wanting to make the most of their space, are
often behind choices of shrubs and flowers.''
Some things do not change. As always, the Rouken Glen Garden Centre
offers some particular bargains in summer flower bulbs. Other offers at
this anniversary sale time worth noting include ICI rose food at #2.49
for a 3KG sack, Irish peat moss at #5.99 for a 200 litre bag and
hortipeat growbags at only 99p each or four for #3.50.
There are also special offers in alpines and heathers and six-pack
pansies. A pre-packed offer of three roses comes at only #2.99.
''Our staff are always willing to offer advice which takes into
account local conditions of light and heat and soil conditions,
including the mainly clay soil to be found around much of the south of
Glasgow,'' said Brian Cullie.
''Each year, the variety of plants and shrubs in stock keeps growing.
The adventurous gardener has never had it so good. That includes so many
of today's plants being container grown. Once planted, they need minimum
attention. Shrubs and ornamental trees include many which are
root-wrapped, lifted in a ball ready for the new location.
''Most plants, including our displays of year-round indoor plants and
flowers, are carefully labelled to offer advice as to best growing
conditions and care.''
Bargain offers extend throughout the entire garden centre, with its
extensive stocks of high quality garden tools. Other features include
displays of stationery and cards, ceramics and fancy goods -- the latter
including some exclusive offers of toys and picture frames.
''People have been looking forward to the time when they can start
organising another season's gardening colour,'' said Brian Cullie.
''That time is now, and you can bring the family along to help decide
what to purchase.
''Everyone is welcome and we've something for everyone.''

WHEN the trading of live animals is under such intense public
scrutiny, Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum's Parrots exhibition could not
be more relevant. Its visual mechanics entice conscience and compassion
to great effect.
The introduction is a leafy, sub-tropical soundtrack installation,
interrupted by the chirpy ''Sparky'' Williams, the budgie who in 1958
became a BBC star. Less media-wise parrots are defined by their colour
-- Tahitian blue, rose-ringed parakeet, scarlet macaw, surfer-crested
cockatoo, etc. It may have been predictable but I would have expected to
see Joseph Crawhall's aviary series -- made at Bristol Zoo in 1888 --
sitting comfortably beside Ralph Steadman's frenzied caricature of Long
John Silver and partner. Here the taxidermist's palate has outshone that
of the artist.
Textiles and decorative art contain layers of cultural rythmn and
magic. A parrot opium mortar or a beautiful Maori wall pattern
constructed of flax and feathers would have Klee or Scully sqawking with
excitement. A ceremonial arrow used by Brazilian Indians for the killing
of parrots is said to whistle through the air towards its mimicking
target, the sound a religious justification for the animal's death. By
contrast Caribbean mythology records the killing of parrots as evil --
even to witness the killing is said to bring untold bad luck.
We owe the parrot family a visit (albeit stuffed and artefact). They
were among the earliest of animals to be taken into captivity, and
became essential colonial luggage, primarily for their beauty but also
for their ability to mimic the human voice without logic or reason.
There's a lesson there somewhere.
* Sparky and friends are perched at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery,
Glasgow, until March 19.

THERE is every reason why contemporary artists should try to redefine
Shakespeare in their own image: there has to be a way of making those
plays come alive for new generations apart from the RSC way, which is
why the Barbican's attempt to bring other versions of Shakespeare to
these shores last year was so intriguing.
Paradoxically, what we also learned is how difficult it is to juggle
contemporaneity with sense: when you disregard the verse, you run the
risk of also losing reality.
Neil Bartlett's first attempt at Shakespeare (in association with West
Yorkshire Playhouse) with Emily Woof as Juliet proves the point. Trying
to eschew romanticism, his production ends up as neither fish nor fowl.
You can't undercut the reality and still expect the story to carry
force. But then maybe Bartlett doesn't entirely believe in the story
anyway. Certainly his version turns out (like Karin Beier's
controversial but emmotionally charged Dusseldorf production) full of
youthful, post-modern irreverence with its echoing, bare stage, piercing
spotlights and loutish street youths.
Unfortunately, though the opening promises much and Bartlett succeeds
in reawakening our awareness of the play's real violence, overall the
production feels energy-less and on occasion, positively pedestrian --
and at three hours, it's much too long. Emily Woof's visceral, angry
Juliet is a pale shadow of Caroline Ebner's for Dusseldorf and some of
the speaking is truly lamentable. Bartlett should have had the courage
of his convictions, cut the play to the bone and realigned the pieces as
a tense, one and a half hours. Now that would have been radical -- and
exciting.

Rob Adams charts the colourful career of solo bassist Eberhard Weber,
who appears in Glasgow tonight
IT'S a universal story with endless permutations, the one about the
chap who didn't want to become a musician so instead he became a
drummer, joined Des O'Connor's backing band, etc, etc.
In Eberhard Weber's case, he didn't want to become a musician so he
became a singer with German bandleader Horst Jankowski -- he whose big
hit, the insidiously jaunty A Walk In The Black Forest, seemed to hang
in the air like midges during the 1960s. Weber can't remember for sure
if he appeared on that record but he certainly recalls singing it many
times during his 10 years with Jankowski. ''Ten years,'' he reiterates.
''That was far too long, a youthful aberration.''
He had been dissuaded from the professional musician's life by his
protective, cello-playing father, who nevertheless started his son on
cello at the age of six. In his teens Weber switched to double bass and
later played jazz in his spare time while working for a company making
television commercials. It was his sister who got him involved in the
Jankowski choir.
After his escape from choral duties he began taking jazz more
seriously. He turned professional in 1972, when he discovered his
electrobass, a customised five-string solid-bodied instrument whose
instantly recognisable sound featured on a whole string of albums for
the ECM label, including his own award-winning Colours of Chloe and the
two still very listenable Solstice albums with guitarist Ralph Towner.
For 10 years Weber led his own group, the popular Colours, but since
1982 he has been a member of saxophonist Jan Garbarek's regular touring
group. This satisfies his need to play with other musicians and allows
him time to concentrate on playing solo, which he has become more and
more interested in, not for any ego gratification purposes (''well,
maybe just a little bit''), but to see how far the instrument can go.
The idea of solo bass concerts, he readily acknowledges, can frighten
people off. ''Because it's not a recognised solo instrument you're seen
as some sort of weirdo. People think it's going to be all
art-for-art's-sake, after which everyone says 'so what'. But I try to
give them something that they will remember hours, maybe even days after
the concert. It's important that we all get pleasure from the music.''
Weber's ''the bass as orchestra'' approach is aided by technology such
as digital delay which enables him to build a composition from a simple
bassline, adding melodies, chords, rhythm patterns, whatever, as he
goes. Although there is an element of improvisation, he works to a
programme which he has evolved over 10 years and two albums, the more
recent of which, Pendulum, ranges in tone between the hauntingly
evocative and the frankly mischievous.
''I'm a little more confident about these concerts now,'' he says.
''It's a struggle to begin with because you worry if you might run out
of ideas. But through time, as the programme builds up, you get more
relaxed and the only thing I might worry about now is if something
breaks down, which is out of my control.
''I can change the programme here and there but whereas I used to
think that people wanted to hear something different every time, now I'm
not so sure. I think they mostly want to hear what they know. They want
to be surprised, also, but not too much.''
The last time Weber played solo in Scotland the surprise was how one
man and his bass, albeit technologically assisted, could hold the
attention for ninety minutes. Give them something they'll remember hours
afterwards? That last concert was five years ago and some people I know
are talking about it still.
* Eberhard Weber plays City Hall, Glasgow, tonight; Queen's Hall,
Edinburgh, Friday; Music Hall, Aberdeen, Saturday.
Elizabeth Clark reports on an ensemble which has gone from strength to
strength
NOT just a concert, but an ''evening out'' is what's promised by the
Kelvin Ensemble who bring their latest programme to Glasgow University's
Bute Hall on Saturday. After a selection from Mozart, Strauss, and
Mendelssohn, the entertainment continues in the form of a post-concert
ceilidh in the University Union to which all of the audience are
invited.
Established in 1991 as Glasgow University's Student Chamber Orchestra,
the Kelvin Ensemble aims to provide quality classical music to staff and
students on campus as well as serving the wider local community. While
the university offers the chance to perform in a symphony orchestra, a
few of the students felt the need for a select group to perform at the
highest possible level with professional conductors -- hence the Kelvin
Ensemble.
Previous concerts have been directed by an impressive collection of
conductors: John Lubbock, Christopher Bell, Richard Honner, Richard
Chester -- and William Conway who returns for Saturday's concert. Having
first conducted them in 1992, Conway believes the Ensemble has grown
from strength to strength.
''They've definitely changed. Initially they were just finding their
feet but they've worked really hard and play to a much higher standard.
They are no longer a scratch band -- they've developed a collective
skill as an orchestra.''
Conway strives for professionalism from the students but recognises
the obstacles which can stand in their way. ''There's a pressure on
students to earn money to survive and part-time jobs eat into rehearsal
time. It's not professional to miss rehearsals and that cuts the
idealism but, on the whole, they are very professional, and more
importantly, they very seriously want to improve.''
Run entirely by students with no assistance from the university music
department, the Ensemble also provides a training ground in orchestral
management. Through impressive marketing and administration, the
Ensemble has benefited from two major awards. In 1993, it was the
recipient of a BT Innovation Award, closely followed by a grant from
Enterprise in Higher Education.
Conway is impressed by their organisation. ''There's a feeling of them
putting something together. They can use the running of the Ensemble as
learning a skill without the pressure of a real job so they can make
mistakes. They can only benefit from that.''
Conway is also quick to acknowledge the expertise of the former
commercial manager Robert Fleming. ''Robert is outstanding. He did a
very professional job in mobilising the Ensemble and his commitment is
incredible.'' Fleming is currently in London studying for a
post-graduate qualification in arts administration.
Saturday's programme features Mozart's Overture to the Marriage of
Figaro, Strauss's Oboe Concerto and Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony (No
3). Conway is pleased with the rehearsal so far. ''It's shaping up very
well. The Mendelssohn has come together, but the Mozart needs a little
more work -- it's a difficult style to achieve and must be knocked into
shape. Thankfully these players can be knocked into shape.''
The Strauss will be performed by young oboist Jane Emanuel. Conway has
worked previously with Emanuel in the National Youth Orchestra of
Scotland Chamber Group and is impressed by her technical and musical
skills, both of which are required to pull off the formidable Strauss
Concerto.
Coincidentally, Conway has recently returned from Italy where he was
conducting oboist Douglas Boyd in the Strauss and, while Conway will be
conducting Emanuel this Saturday, Boyd will be performing the same work
with the Royal SNO. There's no ceilidh after the Royal SNO's concert so
you know which performance I'll be at.
* The Kelvin Ensemble perform in Glasgow University's Bute Hall,
Saturday night, 7.30pm.

''WITH your bright yellow gun, you own the sun.'' What does this mean?
''Keep an eye on me, I shimmer on horizons.'' Pardon? While last night's
show brought us no closer to full comprehension of Kristin Hersh's
lyrics, it confirmed the truly important things we know about her and
her band: Throwing Muses are awesome, beautiful, unique. And strange.
Definitely strange, but in the most life-enhancing way.
Oh yes. For one thing, there were Kristin's stately and spiralling
guitar riffs of surpassing weirdness, rococo beezers that she kept
pealing out one after another. And Throwing Muses' music manages to be
simultaneously neurotic and slinky; so wistful and yet so sinister. Two
guitars, drums, keyboards: how can such freshness and dramatic
complexity spring from such a traditional instrumental line-up?
And while on one song Kristin was cooing a soft and doomy Gothic
lullaby, the next she was ululating in the raw-throated manner of a
muezzin calling the faithful to stage a bloody jihad. And pardon me, but
shouldn't someone capable of such other-worldly vocalising look a little
more alien?
Kristin didn't. With her bobbed hair, and in jeans and a man's white
shirt, she resembled a weekending schoolteacher. Only by the gentle
side-to-side rolling of her head, like a snake before a mongoose, would
you have guessed at her hypnotic lure.
It sure worked on one unfeasibly vast chap who spent most of last
night trying to shimmy out of his skin on the Plaza's dancefloor. Were
his shoes Vaseline'd? Was he trapped in an invisible hula hoop? Dunno.
Like Kristin Hersh and Throwing Muses, some things are best experienced
rather than merely understood.

DONALD MACLEAN's set design, painted on the back brickwork of the
theatre space, is symbolic of this Arches Theatre Company's dramatic
version of Beaumarchais's opera, translated by Graham Anderson; bold and
amusingly gaudy but two-dimensional.
Director Caroline Hall focuses on the farcical elements of the Count
Almaviva's attempts to win the young beautiful Rosina from her dastardly
guardian, Bartholo, with performances which seem to satirise amateur
dramatics, all silent-screen-style posturing and exaggerated asides.
Tom McGovern plays Almaviva as a slick, smirky James Bond type,
obviously revelling in such licence to overkill, while Neve McIntosh's
Rosine is the kind of ''woe-is-me'' heroine who is usually tied to
railway tracks. Indeed, Hall does tether Rosine; she's confined to
quarters by means of a thick rope, a visual joke which is too laboured
by the time it becomes the prop in a tango-style encounter between the
two young lovers to seem witty any more.
Robert Carr turns in the best performance of the night; prancing about
the stage in his penguin suit, wheezing like a walrus and sweating like
a pig. It's a manic characterisation but, like Jack Nicholson's Joker in
Batman, he pulls it off.
Having clearly hoisted a pink flag in the first half the camp crew
have more fun in the second, where the action becomes slicker and
sometimes very funny. But the comedy can be too crude or, again, too
laboured -- Almaviva snorting cocaine not once, not twice, but three
lines. The dynamics were meaningful in just one subtle moment -- when
McGovern shushed his new wife with an imperious snap of the fingers and
fleetingly became the kind of tyrannous master Rosine had just escaped.

UBU brings out the worst in people. And I mean that in the nicest
possible way. There's something about Alfred Jarry's 1888 schoolboy
satire, shambolic, anarchic, ill-structured though it is, that inspires
companies to do their theatrical best.
Graeae Theatre Company, furthermore, believe that the play still needs
shaking up; that in an age when sex, violence and sweary-words are
routinely taken to their graphic extreme, Ubu needs an extra injection
of extremism to hold its own. This the company provides by dint of the
fact that each of its members is in some way disabled -- they know what
it means to be social outcasts and with the help of Ubu they cheerfully
take us into a netherworld of misfits and madness.
It starts with a bowel movement and ends with a show of two fingers.
In between we get masturbation, talking buttocks, death by castration,
blow-up dolls, and a bursting colostomy bag. Pleasant it is not. Funny
it is.
The production might lack variety and tone -- it is either vulgar or
very vulgar -- but it makes up for it in the tremendous range of the
performers. Ubu himself, played by James Beddard, red-eyed and
crop-headed, with the girth of a floundering tugboat and the guttural
voice of a drain, is a fine match for his wife, played by the
wheelchair-bound Sara Beer with a continual tirade of vulgar scouse
backchat and sexual obsession, but their coarseness contrasts starkly to
the delicately executed mime of Mandy Colleran as the Queen.
I could have lived without the second half, but well worth seeing for
the first.

BBC Scotland might be celebrating the 700th anniversary of the treaty
establishing the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France but there is
obviously no chance of an alliance, not even a soupcon of a nouveau one,
between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
The Beeb were induced to break the news of their seven-hour televisual
feast on February 18 at a launch in Edinburgh following complaints from
hacks from Auld Reekie, who are fed up of traipsing through to Glasgow.
At the event at Malmaison a representative from Edinburgh District
Council crowed over this achievement and revealed that the publicity
department of EDC were given a #70,000 shot in the arm after Edinburgh
lost the 1999 City Of Architecture award to the so-called Second City,
to enable them to trump their rivals in other matters.
Perhaps a more enlightened attitude could help them in this
aspiration. BBC Scotland's plans to film the Lothian and Borders Pipe
Band playing on the esplanade at the Castle were almost scuppered when
eyebrows were raised over their choice of tune, a version of the Serge
Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin hit Je t'aime (moi non plus). Recalling the
BBC ban over its sexy lyrics when the song was a hit way back in 69,
Edinburgh officialdom duly pursed its lips and demanded assurances from
BBC Scotland producers that they weren't intending to superimpose saucy
pics over the pipers' footage.
Saucy stuff will be seen on the Auld Alliance night, however, in a
short programme, Les Clips, featuring a montage of clips from French
advertising, a medium not famed for its prissiness. Commenting on the
casual nudity and a clip featuring a French rugby team playing with a
live cockerel -- and we don't mean as scrum-half, animal rights
protestors check the Chunnel times now -- will be television newcomer
Jenni Falconer.
Falconer, a 19-year-old from Milngavie who studies at the University
of Leeds, was star-spotted by the Beeb following an appearance last year
on Blind Date, a fact which will no doubt up the ante on the
exhibitionist factor of the guys'n'gals greeting Cilla.
The wrong image
* BENCHTOUR'S production of Salman Rushdie's children's tale Haroun
and the Sea of Stories has created a deal of controversy, with adapter A
L Kennedy now dissociating herself from the piece. But while the company
have successfully defended themselves against accusations of exploiting
the Rushdie fatwah, they have had to put their hands up and admit to
creating a tasteless publicity image.
A photo of a chap holding aloft a burning book adorned posters for
their tour in Denmark and appalled Rushdie's agent who regarded it as
highly inflammatory.
Benchtours assured him that the image would be withdrawn and duly
recalled the early publicity pics they had sent out. Unfortunately one
slipped though the net and appears in the MacRoberts Arts Centre's
spring programme. ''It's really unfortunate,'' says Neil Cairns,
Benchtour administrator. ''We agree that it was provocative and stupid
of us and we regret it hugely.''
Throwing in the towel
* SCI-FI fans could be induced from under the duvets and into the
theatre for Strathclyde Theatre Group's lunchtime series of dramatic
adaptations of Douglas Adams' cult bestseller The Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy, performed today and tomorrow at 1.15pm and next Thursday and
Friday at the same time at the Ramshorn Theatre in Ingram Street.
The Ramshorn brochure warns audiences to bring a towel but the stage
effects do not include showers. Those in the know will recognise the
advice as an in-joke reference to Ford Prefect's advice to the hapless
Arthur Dent.
Organists at play
* THE Arts Diary can never resist a reference to organs so is happy to
highlight the Young Organists' Day at Hyndland Parish Church in Glasgow.
Aspiring organists will meet at Hyndland Parish Church for a short talk
-- about the size of their organs? -- and will then disperse to other
local churches for ''hands-on experience'', returning to Hyndland for a
recital by 20-year-old Malcolm Sim, who is also performing at
Kelvingrove Art Gallery earlier the same day at 2.30pm.
Seriously, the event is essential as organists are a dying breed, with
the 23 churches in Glasgow desperately seeking their services.

MUSIC by Prokofiev -- steps from the skater's primer of toe-loops and
triple salkos. Cinderella on Ice is what you might call a glace ballet.
Whatever category it fits into, it is certainly appealing. An
enjoyable mix of highly accomplished skating, colourful spectacle,
intriguing effects, and lively comedy that is just that bit different
from the usual run-of-the-rink extravaganzas because of the balletic
influences on its presentation.
Tatiana Tarasova -- who choreographed the piece -- is known in skating
circles for her coaching of various Russian champions, some 30 Olympic
gold medallists among them. Her approach then was markedly artistic in a
field where everyone -- spectators especially -- seemed on the lookout
for fizzy footwork, improbably complex lifts, and daring corkscrew
jumps.
On stage, in a full-length work like Cinderella, she has scope to
celebrate not just the grace and flow of movement on ice, but to imbue
it with expressiveness and thoughtful interpretation. Her company, the
Russian All Stars, is full of skaters who have just these skills:
technically full of bravura (and in some cases bravado) yet well able to
suggest through delicate gestures the emotional aspects of the
characters they portray.
Marina Pestova is a thoroughly delightful Cinderella. Small,
fine-boned, she is like a pretty little bird -- at first a wee brown
wren in her sad rags but eventually more like a dove when, shimmering
from top to toe (those glass skating boots!), she flies into the arms of
her prince, Marat Akbarov. He really is the ice equivalent of ballet's
chevalier noble. He swoops round the stage in a series of muscular
leaps, his bearing is upright and yet not arrogant, his partnering is
tender and lyrical. In their pas-de-deux, all the implicit innocence and
awakening love of Prokofiev's music is ably translated into elegant
lines and breathtaking lifts.
One catches one's breath almost every time the Jester of Leonid
Kaznakov comes hurtling on stage, bounding and cartwheeling, tumbling
and running pell-mell as if the stage could not contain his energy.
Jesters seem to be the lucky charm of every Russian ballet, this show
was no exception -- the audience adored his antics, but then they also
delighted in the antics of the Ugly Sisters and the Stepmother, all of
whom used exceptional skills to execute some exceedingly clever, gawky
bits of tomfoolery.
Perhaps the lighting washes might have been subtler -- petunia is not
the most flattering of shades, but the effects in general were
attractive. This is entertainment with a touch of class, a sincere
effort to celebrate ice dance at a level beyond the simply showy.
Enjoyable enough to melt the prejudices of anyone who thinks that ''on
ice'' inevitably means tacky cocktails.

Britain's hospitals face a shortage of junior doctors, but many career
paths remain closed to women. Chris Holme speaks to two women surgeons
who made it to the top
PUBLICATION of what you are now reading and the photograph on the
right would have been impossible just three years ago. Finding two
female consultant surgeons in the same room is a rare enough event in
1995.
In October 1991 all 157 consultant, general surgeons in Scotland were
men and there were only a handful of females in surgical specialties.
Hilary Sanfey and Margaret McQueen, both just into their forties and
based at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, hold two of the most prestigious
surgical posts in the country.
Miss Sanfey carries out half of the liver transplants in Scotland, for
which the major problem is finding enough donors to meet the demand at
the right time.
Last October Miss McQueen became Scotland's first consultant in
orthopaedic trauma. She is also involved in the world's largest survey
of the treatment of wrist fractures and a co-founder of Sort-It, a
charity which is about to launch a #5m appeal for the UK's first
specialist trauma unit.
Their appointments signal the first breach in one of the grossest
examples of sex discrimination: those who don't play rugger simply have
not had a fair kick of the medicine ball.
In the space of 20 years the proportion of women graduating from
Scottish medical schools has risen from one third to one half. Within
some schools, like Glasgow, this will increase to nearly two-thirds by
1997. Despite this, virtually none is likely to wield a consultant's
scalpel.
Assuming equal ability, such discrimination represents an overall
estimated annual waste of at least #6m in medical training expenditure
and an even greater wastage of human potential.
Discrimination which imposes the traditional glass ceiling on
promotion prospects at registrar and senior registrar interviews is
rarely overt. It does not need to be. Nor does it even have to exist at
all, except in the minds of those embarking on a career. The same
concept applies in reverse for men contemplating nursing or midwifery.
''Rather than real discrimination, it is just women's perception of
how they will be treated,'' said McQueen.
''Women do not go into surgery because it is perceived that it is much
harder to get on in a surgical specialty. It is a very competitive field
but it is difficult for everyone and it is just as hard to get on in
other hospital specialties.''
She graduated at Edinburgh in 1971 in a class of 150 of which one
third were female.
''They had to have higher entry qualifications -- usually five As at
Highers -- than men, because at that time women were discriminated
against from the start. That is not longer the case,'' McQueen said.
She was intent on a career in orthopaedics from the start and was
appointed Scotland's first female consultant in the specialty in 1987.
''I was never conscious of discrimination against me when I was
training because I think it was considered by my senior colleagues to be
very avant-garde and adventurous to have a female orthopaedic trainee.
''Of my class some left after house jobs and others to have children
and a number went into general practice because it was perceived to be
easier. Nowadays it certainly is not.''
Sanfey's career has been much more widely travelled. After graduating
in Dublin she took in London, Barcelona and finally an assistant
professorship at Charlottesville, Virginia, before coming to the
Scottish Liver Transplant Unit in 1992.
''We are not perceived by people in the hospital as being equal to a
male colleague'' she said.
''I have certainly been asked questions at interviews that were
inappropriate, like: Do you really think we are going to give this job
to a dolly bird or do you think a woman can do this job.''
Both Sanfey and McQueen would not tolerate any such interrogation of
female candidates at the interview panels on which they now sit. They
reject the idea of establishing female networks to combat surgery's old
boys' club mentality and the myths as to which of the sexes makes a
better surgeon.
Schoolgirl expertise in needlework does not imply dexterity with
sutures, and orthopaedics does not require a prop forward's muscles.
''What you need for surgery is stamina,'' said Sanfey.
''There is no doubt in my specialty that if you use brute force you
are not doing it correctly,'' added McQueen.
They argue that the UK hospital career structure brutalises both men
and women, particularly in surgery. It can take 15 years or more from
graduation to consultant, with moves every year or two to another
hospital usually in another city.
This creates havoc for spouses with their own careers and any family
life. It becomes discriminatory because these are the very years when
women would be having children.
A welter of changes in the last three years may yet signal an
improvement. By October 1993, women occupied 14 out of a total of 482
surgical consultancies and a further 36 in the associated specialist
grade.
The Calman report will shorten training time across the UK, in
response to European pressure. In addition, a Scottish Office working
party set out an innovative programme to develop opportunities for
part-time training.
Sanfey said these offer no panaceas. The part-time avenue carries a
second-class stigma, and theoretically can extend training to an absurd
30 years. It is also very difficult to shorten training yet maintain
standards and still reduce the workload of junior doctors.
''In the USA, medicine is still white-male dominated, but at least
there is a well-structured residency programme where you are in the same
post for six years. You know where you are starting off and you know
when you will finish. It is a big help for women,'' she said.
McQueen agreed: ''It will never be easy to combine the two, but it is
perfectly feasible to maintain a family and a career provided you can
plan ahead.''
Married to a chest physician, and with three young children, she is
cheerfully disarming about which role is more demanding.
''I come back to work for a rest. It's easier than being a full-time
mother,'' she said.
So far the scheme for part-time training has attracted nearly 70
applicants, mostly women. Just one has opted for general surgery,
although some have chosen other surgical specialties.
The task of developing the scheme has fallen to Dr Graham Buckley,
executive director of the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and
Dental Education. He says the quality of the female applicants readily
discounts any notion of second-class training.
''They really have been very impressive. My own view is that general
surgery is not a suitable job for a man either. The way people have to
work in it makes it a total commitment which does not allow other things
in your life,'' he said.
Buckley added that there is Scottish Office support for expanding
flexible training, but the long-term solution is for it to be integrated
from the outset as a normal route for career development, rather than
simply as an adjunct.
''We should also think about taking this further beyond the time they
become consultants. The actual demands on NHS consultants as a whole
have increased both in intensity and the length of time they work,'' he
said.

Funds from experience
HAVING a daughter who suffered for years with gynaecological problems
which went undiagnosed gave Melanie Brickley from Kirkintilloch personal
experience of the health difficulties women sometimes suffer.
''Camilla, my daughter, was a student at university. Her pains were
dismissed as menstrual problems,'' says Brickley. Finally, her daughter
collapsed, and was rushed to hospital for an emergency operation . . .
to remove a huge ovarian cyst.
When her mother heard about The Herald Foundation for Women's Health
special investigative clinic for women at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary she
immediately vowed to help fundraise.
''The proposed clinic is exactly the kind of place that would have
helped my daughter,'' said Brickley. As president of the Soroptimists
(Scotland South) she drew members' attention to the project and the
result was a cheque for #350 which was handed over last week to
consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr Helen McEwan, of Glasgow
Royal Infirmary.
Fighting the fear
A BREAST Awareness and Information evening, the first of its kind,
held last week in Airdrie, was an overwhelming success. A team of
experts headed by Dr Jean Lauder of the Breast Screening Association
took women through the procedure after breast cancer is diagnosed.
Organised by local community worker Audrey Cameron this educational
evening was the first of a series to help dispel some of the fears and
myths surrounding the disease.
New rules save lives
WHEN new regulations ensured that aspirin and paracetamol were sold in
child-resistant containers, there were protests from some elderly and
those with arthritis in their hands.
But a report in the British Medical Journal shows the new regulations
resulted in a 5000 drop in the number of childhood incidents involving
the medicines, from 7000 to 2000 within three years.
Casual callers
* SPARE a thought for your GP before you put in a night call. A recent
survey carried out by GP, the doctors' weekly magazine, found that the
majority of patients had no idea they were getting their doctor out of
bed when they called at night.
More than 50% thought their GP was already out, doing another call,
19% thought the GP was sitting in the surgery waiting for the phone to
ring and another 15% waiting by the phone at home.
After-hours plus
* PATIENTS are prepared to attend emergency night centres, according
to a survey on the newly opened Out-of-Hours Assessment Centre in
Dundee. Dr Andrew Russell, a member of the GP co-operative that runs the
centre, says that already 42% of people are willing to attend since it
opened a month ago. ''A lot of people just need reassurance and are
willing to come to the centre if a doctor, rather than a receptionist,
advises them,'' he said.
Waiting-room game
* DEMANDING patients have discovered that the best time to get an
appointment with their doctor is the last one of the day; that way the
doctor can't kick them out because he has another patient waiting.
Vitamins, who needs them?
* WE spend more than #100m a year on vitamin and mineral supplements.
But is it really necessary? No, says Which? the independent consumer
guide in its latest issue, unless you fall into certain categories then
they may be beneficial. They include people with restricted diets
(vegans and children who are faddy eaters), expectant mothers, young
children, women having periods (many are anaemic and lack iron), and
people who are housebound who do not get sufficient exposure to
sunlight, the main source of Vitamin D.
Bad start for heart disease
* THE weight of your baby boy on his first birthday is an indicator of
heart disease in later life. If he is below weight the chances are that
he will develop heart disease. The latest study reported in the current
issue of Monitor Weekly, the doctors' magazine, confirms earlier studies
showing a link between poor nutrition in early life and subsequent heart
disease in middle-age males.

Mary Brennan talked to one man who manages to make light of the trauma
of having a dreaded form of cancer
DAVID Izod pauses: ''HOLD on 'til I roll a fag.'' He senses my
surprise. ''Yes! I Am Still Smoking. Actually I did give it up while I
was having the treatment.
''My consultant didn't insist. Just the opposite, actually. He felt I
was under enough stress already. But it seemed a bit . . . w-e-e-l-l . .
. Anyway, the fags were one way of me gauging that I was feeling
better.'' David Izod pauses. Inhales. And reflects on how he feels now.
On Christmas Eve, 1993, Izod discovered he had cancer. Two weeks later
he was told that the original tumour -- which had been on his right
testicle -- had since spread to the lymph nodes at the back of his
abdomen.
He was just 29, gaining real ground as a writer and solo performer.
The reviews were enthusiastic, the work was coming in. He had a wife.
Life, if he stopped to think about it, was good. Maybe even better than
that.
By midsummer, life -- and he thought about life a lot, by then -- had
become painfully precious. He had undergone intensive chemotherapy,
followed by major surgery. And he had come through. In his own words, he
had lost, ''my mother, my right bollock and my fertility to cancer.
Temporarily I lost my hair and my sense of humour. Fortunately I am now
once again hirsute and happy''.
On the strength of those feelings he wrote The Teratoma Show. (You can
see it at Glasgow's CCA this Friday and Saturday) In it he explores the
stages of the cancer -- he has got to know his disease scientifically as
well as personally -- and he examines the physical and mental processes
of his recovery.
He wrote it because he had learnt that testicular teratoma -- once
regarded as incurable -- could be treated effectively, if properly
diagnosed in time.
He wanted to stand up before an audience and invite the gentlemen to
put their hands down their trousers. He wanted to joke and chivvy them
into an awareness that isn't widely encouraged by brisk campaigns or
mass screening programmes -- and yet testicular cancer is as common as
cervical cancer, so he told me.
He also wanted to celebrate the art of living, and the act of having a
laugh. He was, at the time of writing, utterly euphoric.
And how is he now, three months on? Well, he's waiting for the results
of a scan that commonsense tells him is routine and the odds say should
be clear. Only, of course, he can't be sure.
''And that's when you realise you'll never be sure again. Because what
happened before, happened against the odds. And what are odds anyway? I
was chatting with this bookie who's a friend of mine and he said in the
end it all comes out 50-50. Either something happens, or it doesn't. And
you find yourself thinking 95% likelihood of there being nothing there
isn't enough -- when it's your life you want 100%.''
He's very down the line and open about how that initial high has come
closer and closer to ground level.
''While I was ill, lying there, I found myself thinking about the very
simple physical and emotional activities that I really missed the most.
Having a cigarette. Playing poker with my friends. Cooking. Food. Sex.
Going out for a drink. I talk about it in the show -- it's my Booth of
Brilliant Things.
''And to begin with, when I was starting to get better, there was this
glory of enjoying the simplest of pleasures. Now, now they've slipped
back into the realm of the mundane. And that sense of being intensely
alive, and happy, has gone rather.''
Mind you, though he's in earnest about this sense of let-down, he
actually laughs at how dumped he's feeling. It's this trick he has, of
being able to see the painful absurdities of life.
Laughter, for Izod, is the saving grace. It's there when he describes
himself emerging from the rigours of chemotherapy and surgery. ''If I
may say so, I looked immensely fanciable.
''This huge tumour that had made my belly stick out was gone. I was
thin, looked really sexy and had acquired this brilliant haircut.
''For years I'd worn my hair long. And then, of course, I lost it all
when I started treatment. When it grew back in, I had this crew cut that
really suited me. Thanks to cancer I had finally found an image I'd
wanted for 15 years!''

SENSITIVE readers will, I hope, forgive the mention of Arnold
Schwarzenegger in consecutive columns. It was Clive James, I think, who
said he looked like a condom stuffed with walnuts. You can forget the
birth-control allusion. Now Arnie, once a big swaggering macho
terminator, is giving birth soon at a cinema near you. Hollywood's
recent obsession with dads and the meaning of fatherhood has reached its
logical conclusion.
It began I suppose with Look Who's Talking where a cutesy baby
auditioned potential fathers who reached out through their
career-hardened hearts to get in touch with their tender side. Hmm. Then
there was Tom Hanks in Sleepless in Seattle, followed by Robin Williams
dressed up like a denizen of Morningside to masquerade as a housekeeper
in Mrs Doubtfire, and set his bosom aflame for laughs. Better not, I
fear, to deconstruct the latter scene.
Even the dreary Lion King spouted a stern moral message. The defining
moment came when the naughty lion cub Simba slunk up to his father
expecting a clout round the ear, only to have Mufasa go all sensitive on
him and start talking about stars and the Meaning Of Life.
It was another parable about fatherhood, made for an uneasy market by
people worried that men no longer know how to be a dad. As if it has
ever been easy. As if this generation has suddenly discovered a gushing
well of male tenderness.
The right-on right-wing American sociologist Charles Murray wrote that
supporting a family is a central means for a man to prove to himself
that he is a mensch: ''Men who do not support families tend to find
other ways to prove that they are men, which tend to take various
destructive forms.'' The daddy films all seem to overflow with the same
cracker-barrel philosophy of human relations.
When Mufasa gets his in the Lion King, Simba hangs out in the jungle
crooning forgettable songs (so irresponsible) while his community is
devastated by lawlessness. But it turns out all right in the end. Simba
meets a nice girl, gets a job (being King) and in case we miss the
point, the final golden shot is of him with his wife and their new baby.
(Such a difference, don't you think, from the message conveyed by
other more enduring Disney dramas: innocent little Snow White, forced to
shack up with seven hygienically-challenged diamond miners, Cinderella
forsaking a life of domestic drudgery to fall in love with a shoe
fetishist, The Little Mermaid swapping her voice for a full set of
genitals.) Now we are asked to believe that the Terminator has forsaken
violence and rehabilitated the tender virtues. And if he cannot make it
as a believable dad, well let's just turn him into a mom.
What is this about? If there is some difficulty here about Hollywood
knowing how to define the male role, some insecurity about knowing what
a man is for, what does it tell us about a culture that thinks the
answer is to give him a womb of his own? What message is there for women
here? Is it revenge, do you think? Is the fine tuning of the sexes now
so awry that we can expect women to take on the violence Arnie has
vacated. Call up some full-scale role reversal. Go around wielding
handbags weighted with boulders to be aimed at the crotch of any male
under 85 who stops you in the street to ask the way? Especially if he
speaks with a funny foreign accent.
Yes of course the role of the sexes has changed. They are not, though,
never have been, immutable roles. They have from time immemorial had to
adapt to prevailing social conditions. From the innumerable women whose
suffering and endurance were ''like little black knots holding the web
of history together'', that Neil Gunn wrote about, to the men for whom
dire economic forces have marked the abrupt end to their working life in
the labour market, in the depressions of the twenties and thirties, and
now in the men I see every day taking the children to nursery and
school, because their partners are out there in our new brave new
mobile, deregulated workforce, in part-time low-paid jobs. Men and
women's roles are changed more by the forces of economics than by any
brazen feminism.
Oh but we're all equal now, the post-feminists prate. Sexism, we are
asssured, in this brave new post-feminist age is no more than a fantasy
bred by a few embittered maiden aunts with the requisite lack of humour.
Young people now take sexual equality as part of their culture. Any
woman still shouting the odds has a special interest or pressure group
to defend. It's tosh.
It is not poker-faced feminism that has led women to seize the moment
and the balls and catapulted men into a new laddish frenzy about their
lack of a role. In caricaturing and magnifying the new dad, the
film-makers may have their collective tongues in their cheek but their
brains have disappeared up their own sphincter.
Behind the caring, sensitive image promoted by the daddy films is the
vain, petulant, arrogance of a fretful culture whose over-riding emotion
is of resentment and terror that the dominant role is being usurped. The
enemy remains the other sex. Women are useful scapegoats for all the
ills of economies in decline and the changes demanded by uncontrolled
market forces. So much easier to punch than any abstract economic
notion.
What was it the philosopher said? Something about trying to save
damaged traditions by conscious effort being like trying to repair a
broken spider's web with bare hands. The strands are too fine and too
sticky and their interrelations too complex.
Och well, never mind: just wait till Arnie gets his feet into the
stirrups. Then he'll know the meaning of violence. But pass him the gas
and air. Even Terminators bleed.

ONE of the nice things about Sir Hector Monro is that he has a habit
of answering the occasional parliamentary question directly. This is a
very dangerous tendency for a Government Minister -- almost as bad as
being caught telling the truth.
A couple of years back Hector made a declaration against the
legalisation of water cut-offs -- a stand so firm that it eventually
became bedded down as official policy.
Yesterday at the Scottish Grand Committee, Monro bagged it again. This
time he responded to persistent questioning by saying that there would
be a formal consultation exercise into the cutting of the Motorail and
Fort William sleeper services.
The immediate consequence of the new Monro doctrine must be to prevent
any change in the rail timetable while the consultation exercise is
being carried through. For a short time at least uncertainty will be
removed from these services and the Highland rail campaigners have more
valuable time to gather their clans.
It is difficult to be certain whether this was a deliberate
intervention by Sir Hector. It is even possible that he does not know
himself given that he had moved into the debate only as a last-minute
substitute for the genuinely unfortunate Allan Stewart.
On the one hand Hector seemed quite firm about the whole matter. On
the other, Lord James Douglas Hamilton, opening the debate, made no
mention of the consultation exercise. This might be because he did not
reach the appropriate page to read out the script or perhaps he, like
the rest of us, was taken by surprise by another Monro demarche.
Sir Hector is now in that state of grace given to very few
politicians. He is genuinely indispensable. After Allan Stewart's fall
there is unlikely to be further movement at ministerial level in the
Scottish Office team. In that sense Hector is in command of the House.
Yesterday's Scottish Grand Committee debate was better than most and
not because of the first bout of mini questions. The problem with the
conduct of Scottish government does not lie in the number of questions
but in the poverty of the answers.
Yesterday's debate struck a chord because the general issue of rail
privatisation was tackled with specific reference to vulnerable
communities whose vital transport links are under threat.
Obviously local representatives were present in force and their
concern lifted the Grand Committee above the ritual exchange of abuse.
There are still, however, the same underlying frustrations. First, the
committee has no power whatsoever. If it had, the integrated Scottish
rail network would not be about to be scrambled.
For example take my near, but not dear, namesake, Mr Trevor Salmon.
His name was on everyone's lips at the Grand Committee. It is into his
hands, as franchise director, that the Government have commended our
railways. And yet Mr Salmon was not even present to hear the Scottish
parliamentarians bumping their gums.
Mr Salmon, who was revealed during the train dispute as a Blairite by
persuasion, could argue that he is not personally responsible for the
threatened disintegration of the network. The whole point about the
Government's madcap plans is that nobody is responsible and that
everybody will end up passing the parcel of responsibility to everybody
else.
The second frustration goes even deeper. Throughout my political
career I have seen many fine campaigns -- even a few, a very few,
successful ones.
However, almost all of them have been rearguard actions, last-ditch
fights to protect something under threat. I wonder what would be
achieved if all that imagination and effort could be channelled into
positive change.
The real point about the railways is not just that the privatisation
plans are a botched job but that the present position is totally
unacceptable.
The investment levels are pathetic compared with any other country. In
terms of rail infrastructure they are a quarter of the level of Germany
and one tenth the per capita spend in Switzerland.
What little spending there is is highly focused on London and the
South-east so that taxpayers round the country can cough up for the
consequences of London congestion.
In the North direct services to London are running at half the level
of a decade ago. While John Major, a Prime Minister who is unsure about
the geographical location of Fort William, rambles on about the supposed
dire consequences of political separation, British Rail have been busy
economically separating Inverness and Aberdeen from access to vital
markets.
Far from arresting this decline, privatisation will merely free the
railways from the dead hand of the Treasury to turn them over to the
tyranny of the accountants, with an investment time horizon no bigger
than next year's balance sheet.
As Sir Hector might have said: ''This is no way to run a railway.'' It
will take a lot more than the concession of a formal consultation
period, spontaneous or not, to change things for the better.

Are children of a famous person more likely to rebel than children of
the anonymous?
WHEN young James Major collected four red cards on the football field
two seasons ago he faced headlines as well as the wrath of his team
mates. Did his parentage give his opponents extra cause to needle him or
was the retaliatory punch the result of temperament and youth?
Sixteen-year-old Jack Stewart's alleged possession of an air gun made
the headlines because he is the son of Eastwood MP Allan Stewart, who
resigned as a Scottish Office Minister after his own behaviour was
questioned.
The publicity for incidents which would not otherwise make the news
illustrates the extra pressure on young people with famous parents.
It is a chicken and egg argument. Are the children of a famous person
-- particularly a politician who pontificates on good and ill at the
drop of a microphone -- more likely to rebel than the children of the
anonymous or is it that if the children of a prominent person get
accused of getting into trouble they are more likely to find their
escapades publicised?
The expulsion of Nicholas Forsyth (son of Michael, Home Office
Minister) from Rannoch School last year illustrated rather than answered
that question. Mr Michael Barratt, the school's headmaster, said: ''The
boy has a very difficult time ahead of him. Having a famous father is
not easy for him.'' Asked why the pupil had been expelled, Mr Barratt
would say only: ''Drink and drugs were not involved in this case. The
boy was asked to leave for other school-disrupting reasons.''
The fact that it is the children of the rich and famous on whom
fortune has beamed and the children of the poor and unknown upon whom
she has turned her back who are most likely to die as a result of taking
drugs, produces a commonality of tragedy which halts censure but does
raise searching questions about self-esteem and self-identity.
The death of 22-year-old Olivia Channon in the room of Count Gottfried
von Bismarck at Christ Church College, Oxford, after a post-finals
champagne-and-heroin party was not essentially different from the death
of other young heroin users in dingy tenement flats, although it might
appear that one had everything to live for and the others nothing.
Miss Channon's spectacular lifestyle owed something to her personal
wealth (she was a student with a #25,000-a-year allowance) as well as to
the high public profile of her father, Paul Channon, who was Trade and
Industry Secretary at the time.
Mary Parkinson, daughter of former Cabinet Minister Cecil Parkinson,
was fined for possessing cocaine in 1987, when she was 27. After the
court case, she described the pressures: ''I wanted so much to please my
father. He used to get really angry with me because he'd never known
failure in his life. He expected so much from me, but I just couldn't
deliver. The pressure on me was too much and I just cracked.''
It was a significant outburst because it came a few years after her
father had very publicly demonstrated that he had feet of clay. Not only
had he had a long-standing affair with his secretary but had apparently
promised to marry her and then back-tracked once she became pregnant and
pressurised him to keep his word.
A decade before that, Piers Shore, 20-year-old son of the then
Environment Secretary, Peter Shore, had been found dead in a dingy squat
not far from his parents' home in Putney. The inquest ruled that he died
as a result of drug addiction and heard evidence that he had begun
taking drugs at the age of 15.
Coming to terms with the realisation that parents are not the fount of
all knowledge but ordinary, flawed human beings is one of the
developmental tasks everyone has to undertake on the rocky road through
adolescence, according to Margaret McAllister, deputy chair of the
Scottish branch of the British Psychological Society.
She said: ''If the parents are famous it adds another ingredient to
the difficulty of standing back and looking at them as human beings.
Some young people would wish to be famous in their own right which adds
further conflict. Others may feel embarrassed and want to shrink into a
corner and not be noticed, however there are developmental tasks that
every young person must complete.
''Rebellion against parents' values is common and is part of the
process of differentiating yourself as an individual. A great deal
depends on the individual young person and his or her family and whether
the parents communicate with their children in a real sense. If they
communicate seriously with their teenagers it is less likely that they
will run into trouble.''
For MPs, whose business involves them being away from home for a large
part of their time, that is not easy -- and that is true of the
lifestyle of most famous people. The family circumstances -- busy
parents with high incomes -- also make it more likely that the children
will be sent to boarding school which compounds the problem.
According to Margaret McAllister, who specialises in child and
adolescent psychology: ''The lines of communication are likely to be
thin and may snap, making it more likely that young people may come
unstuck. If you have a famous parent, father or mother, or a pair of
famous parents, there is additional pressure if that is not handled
sensibly.''

Some employers are being 'overzealous' in a crackdown against workers
taking sick leave
ONE of the minor pleasures of life is to be slightly ill, Harold
Nicolson once declared. No longer, it seems. Changes in the regulations
governing statutory sick pay and a new drive against absenteeism by
employers are driving workers from their sick beds and forcing them to
have second thoughts about taking a day off.
Absenteeism: in Holland they call it ''the Swedish disease''.
According to the Confederation of British Industry, if the epithet
wasn't reserved for another supposed facet of life in the UK, it ought
to be called ''the British disease''. ''Employers realised we had the
highest spending in Europe on sickness absence, so we've been trying to
get it under control,'' said Dominic Johnson, benefits policy adviser to
the CBI.
Between 1989 and 1993 the proportion of working days lost to sick
leave fell from 6% to 4.5%. This was partly due to fear of unemployment
and partly to a number of procedures adopted by management to tackle the
problem. But absenteeism is still costing the economy 177 million lost
working days a year.
Employers' minds were concentrated further last year by the Statutory
Sick Pay Act, by which the Government essentially off-loaded on them
responsibility for paying the short-term sick. Previously companies
could claim 80% of SSP, so the change cost every employer more than #40
for every sick worker. Despite a relief scheme to help companies hit by
exceptionally high sick-pay bills, the Industrial Society estimates that
the extra cost to British business is more than #1000m a year. That is
on top of the #11bn or so already being paid out through occupational
sick-pay schemes and probably the same amount again in ''the hidden
costs'' of absenteeism, such as the extra stress on those still at work
and the cost of hiring short-term replacements.
A report out this week from the TUC and the Labour Reseach Department
suggests employers have responded to the 1994 Act by intensifying their
crackdown on workers taking sick leave and discriminating in recruitment
against groups thought likely to take sick leave.
Nearly three-quarters of the companies surveyed have tightened their
sickness absence procedures in the past year and nearly a quarter had
changed sick pay or absence policies to the disadvantage of the
workforce.
Interestingly, the survey's findings coincide almost exactly with
those of one by the CBI last year about employers' intentions when the
Act came into force in April.
Ironically, health workers appear to have received the most
heavy-handed treatment. Jim Devine, who represents Scottish health
workers for the union Unison, says: ''We've seen a dramatic change in
attitudes to people who are sick.'' He adds that this is partly because
of Scottish Office guidelines which lay down a target of 2% absenteeism.
The current level in the NHS is more than 6%, he claims.
Cases reported to the union include:
* Frequent instances of staff being telephoned at home to find out why
they aren't at work.
* Sick workers being asked to come to work to explain their absence
after three or four days.
* Moves to dismiss a staff nurse after it became known she had breast
cancer.
* Five nursing sisters in one department at Yorkhill Hospital
receiving letters telling them to report to a senior manager to discuss
absences in the previous six months.
''This is very intimidating to people whose sickness level over a long
period has been first class. We're not defending people who abuse the
system but there's no common sense being applied. Everyone is treated as
if they are malingerers,'' says Devine.
Dominic Johnson of the CBI says good employers don't treat their
workers like this. However, he admits: ''When the Government creates an
incentive for employers to crack down on sick leave, some employers may
be somewhat overzealous.''
The Industrial Society believes there are good and bad ways to control
absenteeism or ''manage attendance'' as they put it. Graham Houston,
head of the Industrial Society of Scotland and Northern Ireland, says
employers who are inflexible about attendance actually increase
absenteesim: ''By refusing time off for legitimate things, like school
or medical visits, family problems and so on, they cause employees to
use sickness as an excuse.''
He says employers can't begin to tackle the problem until they log it.
Scotland falls well behind the rest of the UK in monitoring attendance.
More than a quarter of the Scots managers surveyed by the society last
year had no computerised personnel system and more than a third didn't
calculate the cost of sickness absence because it would be ''too time
consuming''.
At the same time organisations and companies in Scotland which have
started detailed monitoring of absences have found they can achieve
dramatic reductions without resorting to the big stick of disciplinary
procedures and dismissal threats.
Strathclyde Regional Council has reduced absenteeism among its 105,000
workers from 9% to 6% over five years. Their strategy involved
installing monitoring systems capable of spotting patterns of absence.
They also broke down their workforce into small groups of 20 to 30, ''so
that everyone was seen as an individual and not just a works number''.
Each team is responsible for absences in its own sphere, so
introducing an element of peer pressure on persistent absentees. A
council sub-committee monitors absence across all departments and
discusses targets for reducing it. ''We're trying to tackle absence
before it becomes a major problem. We start by making people realise
that the service suffers if they aren't there,'' says Andrew Stewart,
assistant personnel director.
Five years ago Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc, which employs 45,000 people
world-wide, began offering occupational sick pay to its workers from the
first day of absence, instead of the fourth as previously. The result
was that their sick-pay bill rocketed, not only because they were paying
out for the first three days, but because more workers were going sick.
Close monitoring of absence patterns has helped bring sick leave back
down to around 3.5% but, according to Toni McAlinden, S &amp; N's personnel
planning manager, absenteeism will continue to be a serious problem in
Britain until companies reverse recent trends and start taking on more
permanent staff.
He says: ''The causes of absenteeism are much more complex than they
appear on paper. I think it's tied up with job insecurity and long
working hours. Many companies have restructured so that the knock-on
effect of one person going off sick is much bigger. There's more
pressure on those left.''
Peter Burgess of Income Data Services echoes this view: ''On average
people in Britain are working 100 hours a year longer than in Germany.
Maybe that's too much and British workers are redressing the balance by
taking more time off sick.''
NEC Semiconductors in Livingston boasts an absenteeism rate of barely
3% despite its young workforce (average age 22). Contrary to popular
belief, absenteeism is traditionally high among the 18 to 25 age group.
Bill Gold, personnel director at the plant, says their solution is to
organise the workforce into small groups and give them problems to
solve.
''If people are seen to be getting away with staying off, others will
join them. We get in quickly and treat it as a problem that has to be
solved. It doesn't become a disciplinary issue unless the absences
persist.''
''Our approach is to say: 'We missed you' rather than: 'Where the hell
have you been?' ''

February 3.
Judging by his letter headed ''The Euro-con'', John Douglas is
obviously confused over the roles of the various European institutions
(February 3). Sadly he is not alone.
His letter implies that a recent ruling by the European Court of Human
Rights has come about as a result of our membership of the European
Union.
Contrary to popular belief this is not the case. The Court of Human
Rights is part of another body altogether, namely the Council of Europe.
The Council of Europe's piece de resistance is the European Convention
of Human Rights, signed by the Ministers of 12 European countries
(including the United Kingdom) in November, 1950.
It is now the most sophisticated and effective human rights treaty in
the world and has become the model for other regional treaties such as
the American Convention on Human Rights.
The ruling to which Mr Douglas refers, that ''Britain must now
compensate deliberate criminals, poll tax dodgers'' (Mr Douglas's words,
not the court's) is a direct result of Britain being a signatory to the
European Convention on Human Rights.
The Court of Human Rights has powers over a much wider area than the
European Union and covers 35 countries of Europe plus nine former
communist countries such as Russia, Croatia, and Albania.
The ruling in question has no bearing whatsoever on our membership of
the EU and, in my opinion, we have certainly not been conned either as a
signatory of the Human Rights Convention or in our membership of the
European Union.
Mr Douglas highlights yet one more reason why a referendum on any
European issue is not a wise idea. The sad fact is that the British
public in general are ignorant of the many facets of being truly
European.

February 1.
At first glance Brian Wilson's proposed alternative to Clause 4 sounds
great but on closer examination we can see that it presents Labour with
two fundamental problems (February 1).
First, by what constitutional conjuring trick would a Labour
government change us all from being subjects to being citizens?
Secondly, considering that Labour is committed to the market economy
how is it going to manage to implement this new Clause 4? It is full of
contradictions.
I suspect that since Labour is just as committed to the existence of a
subject population as the Tories are, there will be no change of status
to real citizenship, and if there ever is a Labour government it will be
business as usual.
Her Majesty's subjects will get whatever Her Majesty's Government sees
fit to give them, and that will be whatever the market dictates.

Allan Stewart complained on the radio that the Earth First protesters
did not even live in his constituency. I would like to remind him that
one does not have to be resident in Eastwood to care about the
destruction of the environment there. One just has to be resident on
planet Earth.

Discrimination of one kind or another seems to be never out of the
news.
It occurs to me that, as a mere male 5ft 5in in height, I am not
eligible for employment as a police person in the UK. Were I female and
5ft 5in in height, I would be eligible.
Does not that amount to discrimination against me on the ground of my
sex?

Dr John Peters, the Glasgow physician with the nom de plume, is right
to recognise the potential danger for patients in having doctors working
all day, all night, and then on to the next day (February 2).
When the New Deal for junior doctors was finally agreed in 1991 it was
supported by the royal colleges, the Joint Consultants Committee, the
Central Consultants Committee, the Hospital Junior Staff Committee, NHS
managers, and the health departments.
It was important that any new arrangements would carry the agreement
of all concerned and the BMA warned that extra money would be necessary.
Funding from the Scottish Office has been allocated each year since
then to establish new posts to reduce the overall hours of juniors.
Unfortunately there is never sufficient money and other manpower
problems have compounded the staffing difficulties.
The profession is committed to ensuring the success of the New Deal
but it is important that shorter hours for juniors do not result in
longer hours for hospital consultants. We have reiterated that hospital
service commitments must be fulfilled by additional staff so that
patient care does not suffer.
Dr Brian Potter,
Scottish Secretary,
British Medical Association,
3 Hill Place,
Edinburgh.
February 3.
Dr ''John Peters'' describes at first hand the present hectic chaos in
the NHS (February 2). It is revealing that he has to use an alias,
presumably to avoid victimisation. This was not always the case.
Prior to 1974 each local health authority had its own medical officer
of health, who was free, if justified, to speak out in public without
fear on any controversial matter concerning the health of the people,
including, if necessary, hospital care. The MOH had this freedom because
dismissal could only be with the approval of the Secretary of State.
Now the people have no such guardian and the NHS staff no protector.
As a former MOH, I know that this privilege was rarely required but it
is certainly needed now. As a senior doctor I had to put up with
non-medically qualified ''managers'' dictating medical action and
overruling medical opinion.
If you are sick you need a doctor, similarly our sick NHS should have
doctors in charge, not graduates in business administration, think-tank
whiz kids, overpaid management consultants, civil servants and their
ilk. There are plenty of capable doctors, like ''John Peters'',
available.
Dr Donald J C Cameron,
7 Duncan Avenue,
Fochabers.
February 2.
Dr Peters is quite right to highlight some of the problems with the
implementation of the New Deal, the national programme to reduce junior
doctors' hours (February 2). In particular he comments on the lack of
inadequate funding for the changes, and I fully agree with him.
However, he is wrong to suggest that the appointment of large numbers
of additional junior doctors would be a good solution to the problem.
Many of the tasks currently done by junior doctors do not require
medical expertise -- eg filing results, taking blood samples, giving
injections, finding beds for patients, and performing cardiographs.
Redistribution of such tasks to paramedical staff employed
specifically for the purpose would reduce the work intensity for junior
doctors, allowing them to concentrate on their clinical responsibilities
to patients.
However, for reasons of cost, many NHS trusts will not consider this
option, since junior doctors are relatively inexpensive to employ,
particularly outwith office hours -- the overtime rate for junior house
officers is only #3.27 per hour.
In conclusion, I wish to stress that the SJDC remains committed to the
reduction of junior doctors' hours of work, and the intensity of that
work.
This is essential, both to improve patient care in Scottish hospitals
and to improve the lives of our young doctors.
Dr Peter Bennie,
Chairman, Scottish Junior
Doctors' Committee,
3 Hill Place,
Edinburgh.

I feel bound to respond in defence of Julie Davidson, and repel the
unwarranted attack on her professional skills by the chief executive of
Scottish Television (February 2).
Far from ''reviewing her reviewing'' as he would wish, I suggest that
some more of the same objective criticism of Scottish's parochial output
would perhaps expose the myth that the viewing public are happy with
their local station's performance.
The Taggart series must be unique in that each episode is so
disjointed and cluttered with red herrings (perhaps to disguise the lack
of a strong story line) that the ensuing episode requires a voiceover
introduction to remind the viewer of the previous week's plot.
No doubt the wooden co-stars of Taggart are as inundated as Mark
McManus himself must have been with offers of work from elsewhere in the
UK.
Long may Julie Davidson continue to cast an educated eye on the
domestic TV scene, and provide us with an oasis of criticism in a desert
of sycophantic adulation.

In the report ''Thousands of young people overtaxed by computer
error'' (February 3), Mr Docherty remarks that ''it is a serious cause
for concern that the error . . . had not been picked up by anyone''.
This problem, however, was brought to the attention of the appropriate
offices by myself approximately seven years ago.
At the time I had taken up a temporary post with a local authority,
and was distressed to discover when I received my first pay slip that I
had been taxed at the ''emergency rate''. As I had never worked
previously, the allocation of an emergency code number was clearly
inappropriate.
I was able to confirm that all the necessary documentation had been
forwarded to the tax office, and as such this situation should never
have arisen. I contacted the tax office and was assured that this matter
would be dealt with speedily. In my own case it was, as I received a
refund the following month.
In the light of these circumstances I was disturbed by the content of
the article, not least the implication that this error could be put down
to ''teething problems'' with a new computer system.
My own experience suggests strongly that this is not a new problem
resulting from ''wrongly programming a computer'', as the Inland Revenue
investigation concluded, but rather the carrying forward of an error
from the previous system, which the tax office was made aware of some
seven years ago and apparently failed to rectify.

A book is to be published to mark the occasion of the centenary this
year of Cardross Golf Club.
John Scott (1852-1921) was a founder member of the club and was
captain from its inception in 1895 to 1906. Until 1903 his home was at
Church Avenue in Cardross. He then moved to Newlands in Glasgow.
Mr Scott was with the firm of W Graham and Co, Cathedral Street,
Glasgow, for many years, then was the owner of a drysalter's business.
We know that his son Ian was alive in 1960 as our captain of that time
had correspondence with him.
We shall be indebted to any of your readers who are descendants or
relatives of John Scott (or know of their whereabouts) who could furnish
us with a photograph of him for inclusion in the book. After copying we
would return the photograph to its owner.

THROATS are being extra-irrigated in Australia to celebrate the
century of Waltzing Matilda, a great song that has in it a good
question. ''Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?'' it asks.
Assorted theories have paired the ballad with sundry romantic
partners. For it seems that the most Aussie of songs may not be all Oz.
Some other country is involved. Like the tango, the waltzing took two to
do. Did Matilda first wear tartan?
One theory suggests that what the hero of the song first haunted was
not a billabong but a wet Renfrewshire wood where a lame, lovelorn, and
largely forgotten poet was once wont to wander.
It is a large notion to swallow. Yet some Australians do give a damn
for it. A television film crew has been up here from down there to find
out. Intrepidly, they plodded over cold, rainswept hillsides to seek any
haggis roots of their national song.
Intrepid is the word for them. Back home about every dusty sheep
station in Queensland will dispute that it is the only true fountainhead
and poetic spring of Waltzing Matilda.
Certainly, its wizard words could only be Oz -- like jumpbuck (a
sheep) and billabong (watering-hole). And Matilda was no lady. Waltzing
a matilda described how a swagman, or hobo, carried his bedroll.
Besides, the lyric had a namely author. He was Banjo Paterson, a
stickit solicitor, horse fancier, and Sydney newspaper editor. He was
also a poet of the outback and bush balladeer. He wrote the words, no
question; only he. They were first sung in public 100 years ago in
April.
How the music happened is the teaser. Seeking the source of Matilda's
tune was why a Channel 7 crew beat some damp bushes around Paisley.
Earlier, they had called on Kent. In the cathedral city of Rochester an
eighteenth-century ditty called The Bold Fusilier makes a paternity
claim to Matilda. It goes:
And he cried as he tramped through the dear streets of Rochester,
Who'll be a sojer for Marlbro' with me?
It is a sound bid. Banjo Paterson could well have had a newspaperman's
predatory enthusiasm for lifting other people's best lines.
Renfrewshire's shout is altogether more cerebral and solfa.
Once upon a time in Kilbarchan weaving village a blithe tunesmith
named Jamie Barr composed an air for a poem called Bonnie Wood o'
Craigielee. To cloth-eared listeners it is on a different songsheet from
Waltzing Matilda. Musicians, however, detect a family resemblance.
Pipe-sergeant Jim Wark, of Strathclyde Police Pipe Band, agrees. On
Sunday on the soggy slopes of the Gleniffer Braes he accompanied
Caroline Kerr, a musical chartered accountant, who had to sing the song
so often to satisfy a television sound engineer that she may never get
it out of her head.
Jim Wark said afterwards: ''At first I didn't hear any similarity. But
after a wee bit of study it started to come through.''
A plainer connection is the word Craigielee, a name invented by the
poet Robert Tannahill (1774-1810) for a sylvan and romantic part of
Paisley where the town later put its gasworks.
In 1894 at a horse-racing meeting at Warrnambool, Victoria, the
Craigielee love tune resurfaced as a song title, although arranged as a
march played by an artillery band. It caught the ear of young Christina
Macpherson, a lass as Scotch as her name, who said: ''It hasn't any
words that I know of, but it must have had at one time: I believe it to
be an old Scottish tune.''
Months later on holiday in Queensland she hummed the air for Banjo
Paterson, who was on a trek to collect folk tales and work on a ballad
about a drowned swagman. So words and music came together. They had a
first public airing at a hotel in the outback town of Winton.
Although not published for eight years, Matilda was an instant
folksong hit. Its rapid oral circulation strengthens Paisley's claim. So
abundantly had weaver emigrants carried with them Robert Tannahill's
work that in 1874 the faraway Queensland branch of the poet's fan club
celebrated his centenary with many memorial toasts. Also popular must
have remained the music that arrived on the back of Tannahill's words.
Jonathan King, the lofty, big-hatted producer of the two-hour
television programme, remained sceptical. A lurid Paisley pattern (well,
kind of) tie was his one concession to Scottishness. He joked that
Renfrewshire voices would need subtitles.
At Sma' Shot Cottages, the Victorian haven restored by the skills and
sweat of the Old Paisley Society, the four-member television crew were
feasted at a steak-pie lunch and fed all sorts of good Paisley
propaganda.
Jonathan King continued to doubt. ''Very few people in Australia have
heard of Tannahill -- or Paisley,'' he asserted.
Ellen Farmer, the society's irrepressible president, stayed unfazed.
She said: ''Waltzing Matilda is a smashing tune. Everybody in the world
loves it. There are just too many coincidences for it not to be
connected to Paisley.'' Local pride made her add: ''It doesn't surprise
me.''

SOME people dislike mobile telephones; we happen to loathe them with
every fibre of our being. Any day now we envisage being allowed to pay a
charge to BT that will allow us to be completely out of touch with the
world at the touch of a button, and grateful for it.
In the meantime we could not help but notice the photo-call arranged
for next Tuesday by Glasgow's Talking Business, the mobile phone group,
to celebrate the opening of their new shop. Obviously, for such an
occasion you'd want a personality universally recognised for seamless
eloquence and a nice turn of phrase, someone who could articulate the
case for modern telecommunications with wit, poetry, and commanding
oratory, someone with a telephone manner, someone . . .
OK: they've got Kenny Dalglish instead. Aye, um, like, ah mean, naw,
him, aye, sure: Mr Garrulous. Nowhere in the release does it mention,
however, if the least communicative manager in football history will be
available for comment before, after, or even during the event.
Never mind. Just to be on the safe side the organisers have drafted in
the playwright Peter McDougall to help out. No bets are being taken on
the chances of phones being defenestrated during the celebrations, but
Charing Cross isn't the Ubiquitous Chip, after all.
On a more positive note, the organisers state: ''Available props
include mobile phones, football, and balloons.'' The three, we have long
felt, tend to go together.
Take your pick
IS it now safe to say that Allan Stewart has hit the road, or would it
be more accurate just to say that he no longer has first pick of the
jobs?
Calf measures
WITH friends like Carla Lane, what oppressed veal calf need fear
bistecche di vitella cacciatora? Not content with torturing free-range
artics, the playwright has taken to conducting gruesome experiments on
the English language in the pages of the London prints.
In one sheet yesterday she told of her part in a recent demonstration
at Shoreham: ''There is a violent shifting of the crowd. I am lost in
sadness at the sight of dark eyes, the tips of ears, the saliva-covered
noses.'' Yes, it's a hellish life in the modern police force.
Later Ms Lane, having grasped every aspect of the argument, is giving
it her all with a wholly superfluous loudhailer: ''My throat hurts as I
shout at the drivers, 'Tell your children what you do!' 'Murderers!'
'Hitler did this to the Jews!' ''
Oh, indeed: you knew the architect of the Holocaust was bad but you
hadn't realised the full enormity of his crimes, had you? But there's
more. Scenting victory (in a light sauce), Ms Lane concludes her
entirely logical exposition of the case for animal rights: ''Perhaps
something in our gut reminds us that this is a bad world . . .''
Perhaps, on the other hand, it was just a dodgy burger.
Going for mould
STILL, if animal rights activists really want to wean us all off meat,
they might try promoting the latest craze from (where else?) Los
Angeles. We speak, of course, of kombucha mushroom, which isn't a
mushroom at all but a combination of yeast, bacteria, and lichen. Yummy.
Hip Angelenos swear by the stuff which, if we've got this right, you
ferment in water for 10 days with sugar and tea, drink three times a
day, and sit back and wait for your pimples to clear, your ''energy to
lift'', and your sex drive to boldly go where it hasn't gone lately. And
all for a mere $50.
The US Food and Drug Administration has yet to rule on the virtues of
mouldy tea, but users insist there are no nasty side-effects save one
syndrome known as ''the kombucha retch factor''. Now we know what Carla
Lane is on.
Creative definitions
A DISTRUST of computers is a healthy and, on the whole, rational
attitude. Anyone who has run the phrase ''Allan Stewart'' through the
spell-check and come up with ''honourable decision'' will know exactly
what we mean.
But evidence reaches us, from Hong Kong of all places, that the little
electronic beasts are more treacherous than we had thought. In a survey
of 15 electronic dictionaries, the Crown Colony's consumer council (try
saying that after a pint of kombucha) found various examples of unsought
creativity.
Thus, the man who is ''ill at ease all the time'' became the man ''who
is sick but always happy''. The chap who ''bought a gold watch for his
wife'' turned out to be the bloke who ''bought a gold ornament while
carefully waiting for his wife''.
Meanwhile, when the moon rose it became a flower, and when the sky
''cleared up'' it disappeared altogether. Finally, the individual,
possibly even a Diary reader, who ''wanted a break'' was deemed ''in
search of a crack or fissure'', though not necessarily the sort you
might make with a pick-axe while waiting for a quote from Kenny
Dalglish.

AFTER a month in which the Prime Minister chose to launch a major
offensive on devolution, a very substantial majority of Scots, including
a very large minority among his own supporters, would like some form of
distinct Scottish parliament or assembly. Younger voters tend to feel
this way more than older, and the only age category with a preference
for the status quo are those over 65. In some age groups there was a
preference for a completely independent parliament, entirely separate
from England: of those questioned between the ages of 25 and 34 there
was a very large majority which fell to 51% for slightly older voters
between 35 and 44. These findings must be very bad news for the
Government and not just because of the overall total but because of the
dynamic they disclose. When older voters' intentions are so different
from younger and when the younger are progressively more strongly
committed the younger they are, biology alone would appear to favour the
views of the young. Unless, that is, they can be persuaded to change
their minds. In fact, however, Scottish opinion on these matters appears
to have been remarkably consistent for a decade with a slight but
definite trend disclosing a hardening of support for constitutional
change.
How people vote becomes a fact only after they do so, and why they do
so often remains a matter of debate thereafter. The poll has some
comfort for the Government in that when it comes to ranking issues of
public concern, constitutional change is not a priority for many. More
immediate and practical concerns come first. That may change after a
sustained election campaign that focuses on the constitution, but the
poll's findings suggest that the more attention is so focused the more
clearly the reformers will dominate opinion and ensure that that opinion
dominates voting intentions. Of course, public opinion is notoriously
fickle rather than fixed, and an opinion poll (as well as an election
outcome) has something of the quality of a snapshot. A pattern of poll
findings over a decade is another matter, especially when it is
consistent with the actual electoral experience of the two General
Elections embedded within it. The evidence is more daunting to the
Government still, for it also shows a large minority which is in favour
of severing the Union altogether. This may also be a worry to Labour,
which wants to make the Union work better and more responsively to
Scottish views but does not want to end it.
Like social experimentations generally, the case for constitutional
change should be regarded with caution, for it is not easily reversed
even if it goes wrong and people want to think again. But where a very
large majority exists for taking that risk, democratic beliefs insist
that the risk be taken. The poll findings endorse taking that risk, and
only a very different electoral outcome at the next election would
recommend anything different. There is a price for everything, and it
may exist in this case, though it is seldom explored in any systematic
way as yet. Scotland will not be able to change the shape of political
relations in Great Britain without automatically altering English
affairs as well. It is important, therefore, to make changes in line
with, rather than deliberately opposed to, opinion south of the Border
which has itself, if other recently published poll findings there are
accurate, proved to be sympathetic to Scots' aspirations. This is
certainly Labour's position (substantially shared by the Liberal
Democrats), and its proposals for England are designed to fit this wider
context. Even the SNP has come increasingly to adopt a position which
takes English opinion into account in framing the case for separation,
and making sure it is now heard south of the Border as well as here.
What is surely beyond dispute is that a majority of Scots voters do want
a large measure of constitutional change, and only the Conservatives
countenance no change at all. That is hardly a formula for Conservative
electoral success in Scottish seats two years from now.

IT would be interesting to read the history of society as written by a
hairdresser. Seventy-five years ago, for instance, the great social
question facing women was whether or not to follow the example of Irene
Castle, the ballroom dancer, and have their hair bobbed. It was not an
easy decision, particularly in America, for among former doughboys the
shingle bob still had scandalous associations with the mademoiselles
from Armentieres. F Scott Fitzgerald, it will be recalled, even wrote a
short story about it. Fashion goes in cycles, however, and America's
young ladies soon found new role models. Greta Garbo and Veronica Lake
brought long hair back, only to be followed by Betty Grable, who swept
it up again.
During her visit to New York the Princess of Wales may have played a
crucial role in promoting yet another new hair style -- the ''wet
look'', which makes it look as if the wearer has just emerged from a
shower. It is, fortunately, a style that can be modified at short
notice, for any hairdresser's history would include a chapter on
permanent waves. Whereas the century opened with the ''Marcel waving
iron'' and progressed to the 12-hour ordeal of the Nestle wave, modern
hair chemistry allows the same basic cut to be used in five different
ways. There has also been a revolution in colour. No-one would declare
openly that the Princess uses peroxide, of course, but few would dispute
that she might be aided by the euphemistic ''tint'' or ''rinse''. As for
hair sprays, neither Jackie Onassis nor Margaret Thatcher could have
maintained their ''modified bouffants'' without them.
Men are lucky in having easier role models, and also less hair. Their
own ''wet look'' came with Johnny Weissmuller, the film star who really
did get soaked. Men are certainly less ready to accept change. When the
French comedy actor Fernandel visited his barber shop, a new hairdresser
proudly flourished a mirror behind his head. ''Just a little longer at
the back, please,'' Fernandel asked.

A BROTHER-in-law of Virgin chairman Mr Richard Branson died after
carelessly taking more than 20 times the therapeutic level of a
codeine-based painkiller, an inquest heard yesterday.
Glasgow born Mr John Templeman, the brother of Mr Branson's wife,
collapsed in his basement flat in Holland Park, London, on January 7,
just hours after a private call-out doctor had prescribed 120
dihydrocodeine tablets to relive the pain.
Westminster Coroner's Court heard that Mr Templeman, 47, an office
manager, had injured his chest in an accident the previous week. Dr
Alistair Shaw saw Mr Templeman and diagnosed a rib fracture or muscle
injury.
Dr Shaw told the court a broken rib takes six to eight weeks to heal
and is very painful for the first two to four weeks. He said:''I wanted
to make sure he had adequate pain relief for the first two to four
weeks.'' He prescribed 120 tablets of 30mg dihydrocodeine. The correct
dosage is one tablet every four to six hours.
''He did not strike me as someone who would abuse drugs,'' said Dr
Shaw. ''The treatment I gave was fairly standard.'' He also prescribed
20 temazepam sleeping pills for insomnia.
Ms Rose Templeman, of Kensington, said her divorced brother had always
had problems sleeping and it was quite possible he often took more
sleeping pills than he should.
Mr Templeman died in St Mary's hospital after 90 minutes of
unsuccessful resuscitation. Pathologist Dr Iain West said Mr Templeman
had five broken ribs, some caused by the attempts to resuscitate him and
the others about a week previously.
Blood tests revealed a therapeutic level of temazepam, no evidence of
alcohol, but about 20 times the normal level of dihydracodeine.
''It would appear he has taken a moderate overdose of this drug,''
said Dr West. ''He has probably taken half a dozen at a time. He would
have been in quite a lot of pain from his ribs. He certainly has not
taken 70, 80, or 100 tablets.''
Coroner Dr Paul Knapman said: ''We are dealing with somebody who was
rather careless in taking medication from time to time.'' He recorded a
verdict of death by misadventure.

THE Brussels Commission is pumping more than #300m into a new
offensive to protect Europe's film and television industry from the
American onslaught.
But the commission has failed to agree quota limits on the amount of
American programmes which can be shown on European screens.
France is keen to limit the share which foreign films have been taking
of its national market. But other member states have been fighting to
avoid EU restrictions which would upset the United States.
The commission has instead agreed to spend #320m before the end of the
decade on a new audio-visual campaign.
Commissioner Marcelino Oreja told a news conference thatthe
shortcomings of the European industry were mostly in poor preparation
and investment at development stages. This was critical, he said,
because it was then that the future of any production was determined.
The money will be used to support training, develop programmes, and
improve distribution facilities.

A SECURICOR guard told the Bonnyrigg murder trial yesterday how he
found a 63-year-old retired mining engineer dying from a gunshot wound
to the chest.
Mr Robert Bourhill said he found Mr David Dunn lying unconscious in a
car park moments after two men had robbed a bank at gunpoint.
During the raid at the Bank of Scotland in High Street, Bonnyrigg,
Midlothian, one robber stuck a gun in Mr Bourhill's back and a second
held a gun at the head of his Securicor colleague, Mr Ronald Allan, the
High Court in Edinburgh was told.
Mr Bourhill was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Robert Smith, 33,
Mr Gerald McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25, who deny presenting a
loaded gun at Mr Dunn, of Dalhousie Drive, Bonnyrigg, on October 19 last
year, shooting him on the body and murdering him.
They also plead not guilty to assaulting Mr Bourhill and Mr Allan
along with customers and staff at the bank before robbing them of
#185,000.
All three also are charged with attempting to murder PC John Duffy, of
Lothian and Borders Police, Mr John Girdler and Mr Duncan Milliken by
presenting a loaded gun at them and repeatedly discharging the weapon.
Both incidents are alleged to have taken place in Polton Street car
park, Bonnyrigg, on October 19.
Mr Bourhill,36, told the court that he and two colleagues had arrived
at the bank at about 11am. One stayed in the Securicor van while he and
Mr Allan took cash into the bank.
A man wearing a ski mask suddenly jumped between him and Mr Allan and
held a gun at his colleague's head, pointing it just to the right of his
nose. Shown a black revolver in court, Mr Bourhill said it looked like
the gun used in the bank raid.
The man had shouted: ''Get in the bank and don't look.''
Another raider appeared behind him. ''He pushed me in the back. He had
a gun. I didn't see it but I felt it in my back.''
Mr Bourhill said the security men, customers and bank staff were
ordered to lie on the floor while the raiders took cash from the bank's
strong room. The whole incident took about a minute.
He and Mr Allan ran after the robbers, along Bonnyrigg's High Street
and into a vennel leading to Polton Street car park. As he was running
along the vennel, he heard two gunshots.
As he entered the car park, he saw two ''bandits'' being caught.
One was on his knees next to the open door of a silver grey Ford
Granada, being held round the shoulder by a member of the public. The
man had not been one of the two in the bank.
''Another bandit was lying flat on his stomach. I had seen him in the
bank. There was a gentleman holding him down, just lying on top of
him.''
Mr Bourhill said the revolver that he had seen in the bank was lying
about two feet away.
He then heard a woman shouting: ''Get an ambulance, he's been shot.''
She was talking about a man lying next to a car. ''I went over to him.
He was shot in the chest. He was unconscious.''
The guard told the court the next thing he saw was a man carrying a
blue bank bag jumping over a wall at the end of the car park.
Mr Bourhill identified Mr Smith as the man who jumped over the wall,
Mr McQuade as the man lying on his stomach in the car park and Mr
Bootland as the man on his knees.
Cross-examined by Mr Derek Ogg, counsel for Mr Smith, Mr Bourhill
accepted that his identification of people in the bank might be flawed
but he added: ''I'm sure about the identification in the car park. They
weren't masked in the car park. I saw their faces.''
The trial continues.

GOVERNMENT claims about UK workers take-home pay met with expressions
of disbelief from the Labour Party yesterday.
Employment Minister Phillip Oppenheim said average take-home pay for
an unmarried full-time production worker is higher in the UK than any EU
state except Luxembourg.
He added that, for a married couple with two children, the
corresponding figure was still higher than in most other EU countries.
Commenting on these figures, gleaned from the February edition of the
Government's Employment Gazette, Mr Oppenheim said they showed that
Government policies had helped make British production workers among the
best paid in Europe. Service sector comparisons also suggested that
British workers were well paid, he claimed.
Labour denounced Mr Oppenheim for ''an extremely selective use of
statistics'', pointing out that UK workers put in an average of four
hours a week more than the average EU worker.

AGRICULTURE Minister Mr William Waldegrave yesterday condemned
protesters who resort to ''mob violence'' in an effort to end live
animal exports and promised that ''the rule of law'' would be upheld.
He also warned farmers that they must respond to demands for higher
welfare standards and said ''cowboy'' hauliers had to be weeded out.
Mr Waldegrave's attack on activists earned him warm applause at the
annual conference of the National Farmers' Union in London.
It angered welfare campaigners, who said the vast majority of protests
were being carried out peacefully by ''ordinary people''.
''The British public, and increasingly public opinion in other
European countries too, demands nothing but the highest standards of
care for animals,'' said Mr Waldegrave.
''But there is another side as well. There is a straightforward law
and order issue.
''While a trade remains legal, it strikes at the heart of the rule of
law -- the same rule of law which amongst other things protects animals
-- if mob violence effectively drives people out of legal business.''
Mr Waldegrave was speaking after NFU chairman Sir David Naish told
farmers that they must not be intimidated by ''boot boys in
balaclavas''.
Sir David yesterday said he was determined that the lawful live export
trade would continue.
''The public has rights but so do farmers -- farmers of this country
who carry out this lawful business,'' he said.
Mr Waldegrave is due to meet French Agriculture Minister Jean Puech
next week when he will again press for new maximum time limits on animal
journeys and call for the European Union to improve the way it polices
hauliers.
He said he understood that the EU had only one full-time official
responsible for monitoring animal hauliers -- most checks are left to
individual countries.
* A woman and a four-year-old boy were critically ill in hospital
yesterday after a lorry believed to be taking sheep to the Essex port of
Brightlingsea for export overturned in a crash.
The lorry jack-knifed on the A2 near Gravesend, Kent, and police said
130 of the 300 sheep on board were killed.
Their bodies piled up at the roadside as emergency workers fought to
rescue other animals.
The lorry and a Mini collided in the crash and the injured woman
passenger had to be cut free from wreckage, police said.
She was taken to West Hill Hospital, Dartford, and the boy to Atkinson
Morley's Hospital, south London.
It is understood that the woman driver of the car and another child, a
three-year-old boy, escaped serious injury.

ANIMALS are routinely subject to brutality at livestock markets, the
Edinburgh-based campaign group, Advocates for Animals, claimed
yesterday.
It mounted an investigation between July and November last year using
a hidden camera on visits to 11 Scottish markets and one in England.
This recorded 34 separate apparent breaches in animal welfare
regulations.
Filming was carried out at Carlisle, Ayr, Dumfries, Castle Douglas,
Lanark, St Boswell's, Forfar, Paisley, Stirling, Strathaven and two
marts in Edinburgh.
Mr Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, said it was
commonplace to see pigs, sheep and calves kicked, punched and struck in
the face by sticks.
Adequate bedding was seldom provided and at no stage during filming
was any attempt made to curb the violence.
Mr Ward said cruelty was evident to a greater or lesser degree at all
the marts and was carried out by farmers, drovers and auction staff,
sometimes under the direct gaze of the auctioneer.
He added: ''We are certainly not saying that everyone indulges in
this. We have never condemned the whole of the farming community, but
they do have a responsibility to rear livestock in humane conditions,
put them through a humane market system and then give them a quiet
death.
''If we could achieve that situation, it would be great.''
Mr Ward said there was statutory provision for animal welfare at
auctions. However, systems to monitor it by auction staff, local
authorities, animal inspectors and police were inadequate and in some
cases virtually non-existent.
Footage from the investigation will be shown tonight on BBC's
Frontline Scotland programme.
A spokesman for the Institute of Auctioneers and Appraisers in
Scotland, said last night he could not comment until he had seen the
report and the film.

MR Bashir Maan, who in the early seventies was police convener on the
former Corporation of Glasgow, and who is one of Scotland's most
prominent ethnic community leaders, has been adopted as a Labour
candidate for the new Glasgow unitary authority.
The irony of his victory in the Firhill Ward was that he defeated a
Strathclyde councillor who has worked tirelessly over the years for
racial harmony.
Councillor John Gray and Bashir Maan were tied 7-7 for three ballots
at the selection conference, but the councillor eventually lost by the
toss of a coin.
He said last night: ''For 20 years I have worked for good race
relations in this city and I'm astounded that someone like Bashir Maan
should oppose me. This is all about local power broking. That's all I
want to say.''
Mr Maan said he was extremely sorry about Councillor Gray's situation.

EDINBURGH Royal Infirmary is to have Europe's most advanced scanner
unit to investigate patients with serious illnesses.
Thousands will be checked by the equipment, reducing the need for
X-rays and exploratory surgery.
The equipment is being supplied by US-based International General
Electric, which has an office in Livingston, West Lothian.
It consists of a computer tomography scanner and a magnetic resonance
imager. Staff will use the equipment to trace tumours, bone disorders,
and other illnesses when it arrives in about eight weeks.
The plan is to hire the scanners, which are each worth #2m. Hire and
operating them will cost #1m a year.
Dr Ian Beggs, consultant radiologist, said: ''We will be able to
reduce from 20 minutes to five minutes the time it takes to scan a
patient fully.''

STATION master Paul Cook, dismissed for being under the influence of
alcohol when he turned up to take charge of Scotland's busiest station,
was yesterday ordered to carry out 150 hours of community service when
he appeared for sentence at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Cook, 33, of Whitehill Street, Dennistoun, Glasgow, was found guilty
three weeks ago of being drunk in charge of Glasgow Central when he
turned up for duty one night in July last year.
Yesterday Sheriff Alexander McIlwain told him that, thanks to the
prompt and responsible action of one of his colleagues, no one was
actually put at risk because of the condition he was in.
Sheriff McIlwain said he was taking that into account, plus the fact
that Cook had not only lost his job, but had lost one he had applied for
because of the publicity surrounding his case.
The prosecution, believed to be the first of its kind at Glasgow
Sheriff Court, was brought under the 1992 Transport and Works Act.

TWO armed robbers who were caught red-handed were each jailed for 15
years yesterday at the High Court in Glasgow.
A jury heard that as Robert Findlay and William Graham, both 35, ran
from a post office in the East End of the city, an anti-theft device
detonated in the security case, which contained #15,000. The raiders
were engulfed in red dye and smoke.
The container made a bleeping noise, which helped trace the men
through a graveyard, where they had frightened six schoolboys by
pointing a sawn-off shotgun at them.
Police who surrounded the graveyard in Glasgow's East End caught the
men in a nearby street. There was red dye all over their clothing.
A jury took less than an hour to find them guilty of robbing postman
Gerard Stewart at gunpoint outside the post office in Tollcross Road,
Shettleston, on October 21 last year.
They were also found guilty of presenting the gun at the boys and
possessing a firearm during the crimes.
Temporary judge Alexander Wilkinson, QC, was told that Findlay, of
Gatehouse Street, Shettleston, and Graham, of Ross Drive, Viewpark,
Uddingston, had previous convictions, including eight-year sentences for
assault and robbery.
Mr Stewart told Mr Scott Brady, prosecuting, he had just taken the
money from the locked security van when the masked men appeared from
''nowhere''.
One of them pointed the shotgun at him and he flung the case of money
at him.
''They were putting it into a bin bag when the case exploded with a
flash and a bang and smoke and red dye poured out,'' he said.
Mr Stewart and his driver, Charles Haggerty, chased the robbers but
lost sight of them.
The mailmen said the ordeal shocked them and they were both off work
for weeks.
Schoolboys said they saw the two masked men in the graveyard trying to
get the case open but ran off when the gun was pointed at them.
When caught, Findlay and Graham told police they had seen other men
dropping the case but could not explain the red dye on their clothing
and cartridges found in their possession.

THE Prime Minister was rebuked yesterday for his choice of language in
the Commons by the Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd.
In a special statement to MPs, she made clear that she took a dim view
of epithets like ''dimwit'' the one hurled across the despatch boxes by
Mr Major at Mr Blair the day before.
She did not single out the Prime Minister by name, but, by including
not only Honourable Members (ordinary MPs) but Right Honourables (Privy
Councillors) in her strictures, it was clear she did not exclude him.
Miss Boothroyd said she knew ''only too well from my postbag that some
of the exchanges across the floor of this House do not enhance it in the
eyes of our electorate.''
Some Members, she said severely, ''seem to think it is rather smart or
clever to manipulate the English language in making references to other
Members across the floor of the House,''
The Speaker urged MPs to ''make use of the richness of the English
language to select elegant phrases that express their meaning without
causing offence to others. ''
Her message came too late -- one might say several centuries too late
-- to head off some less than elegant phrases uttered in a single
24-hour period.
The previous evening, Labour's Michael Meacher called Transport
Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney ''a man who has raised used car
salesmanship to a new art form'' and ''an old lag,'' although he did
add, in case the House had not caught on, that he was being
light-hearted.
Earlier yesterday, Mr Tony Banks (Newham North West -- Lab.) told
junior Transport Minister Steven Norris that he was ''the most
proficient bull-shitter the Government has got.'' Reports that
Disraeli's statue in the Members' lobby just outside the Chamber,
shuddered could not be confirmed.
Later, in the very session over which Miss Boothroyd was presiding,
Labour's Consumer Affairs spokesman Nigel Girffiths (Edinburgh South),
treading closely in Mr Major's footsteps, called Trade and Industry
Minister Charles Wardle ''a nitwit.'' Mr Wardle, rejecting his charges
about the ill-effects of changes in the gas industry on the elderly and
disabled, ended his retort with ''so, who's the nitwit?''
One cannot pretend that any of this is the stuff of great
parliamentary debate. The television age has caused politicians to set
great store by the sound bite -- a phrase or at most two sentences which
incorporates their essential message.
There is always the danger that in trying to be colourful enough to
get on the TV news may take precedence over the message. To be fair to
Mr Major, ''dimwit'' seemed a spontaneous addition arising out of
annoyance at being called a weak Prime Minister by Mr Blair.
Erskine May -- the ''bible'' of parliamentary procedure -- says a
Member must not accuse another of deliberately lying or impute false or
unavowed motives and must not misrepresent what another Member has said.
The Commons business would go into gridlock if the chair tried to police
that one strictly. Nor must they utter, ''abusive and insulting language
likely to cause disorder.''
Members have been brought to order, Scots may be interested to know,
for calling another ''a blether.'' Rather obvious accusations like
''traitor,'' ''criminal'', or ''hypocrites'' have been barred. So has
''cheeky young pup,'' ''jackass,'' and ''rat.''
In the so-called Golden Age of parliamentary oratory the likes of
Gladstone and Disraeli had hours to spread themselves although Dizzy
could come up with one liners like ''justice is truth in action.''
Even within living memory the following exchange would have fitted
well into a television report:
Angry Opposition Front Bencher attacking a Government policy ''I can
think of no clearer example of the triumph of expediency over
principle.'' The Minister, asking him to give way, enquired sweetly:
''Has the Right Honourable gentleman considered his own career.'' Even
the victim laughed.

By Our Parliamentary
Correspondent
EXTRA funding of more than #300,000 is being made available to four of
Scotland's biggest health boards to help tackle the drugs problem, it
was announced yesterday.
The announcement was made by Scottish Office Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton at a meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee at
Westminster, and was formally confirmed in a statement by Health
Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie.
Most of the money, #213,000, will go to the Greater Glasgow Health
Board; #50,000 will go to Tayside and #40,000 to Lothian and #8000 to
Grampian.
Lord Fraser said in a statement: ''The increased allocations are being
made following discussions with health boards about their funding
requirements for drug misuse services for the remainder of 1994-95.
''The additional resources of over #200,000 being provided to GGHB in
particular reflects the success of the Glasgow Drug Problem Service
during its first year of operation. The extra funding for the three
other boards is similarly for the development of drug services.''
The issue was raised in the Scottish Grand Committee by Glasgow
Central Labour MP Mike Watson. He welcomed the additional resources but
questioned whether they would be enough.
He said: ''Young people continue to die in Scotland on a horrifyingly
regular basis, for a number of reasons on drug-related matters. That
challenge cannot be met without a significant increase in funds.'' Mr
Watson demanded: ''What can you do to ensure the toll of death on our
streets is brought to a stop?''
Lord James told him that the Government took the matter very seriously
and pledged: ''We will deal with these matters with as much urgency as
possible.''

A TOP insurance company is continuing to claim in advertisements that
it can arrange fast-track hospital care for patients, despite Government
warnings, it was claimed at Westminster yesterday.
Labour MP Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West) said at the Scottish Grand
Committee: ''Over a year ago, I complained to the Government about the
activities of Norwich Union, who were issuing advertisements claiming
they could arrange fast access for their clients to beds in NHS
hospitals.
''Ministers expressed their concern to Norwich Union, but the company
is still cocking a snook at the Government by continuing to issue such
advertisements.
''If the claim in the advertisements is true, why should private
patients be able to jump the queue for beds in NHS hospitals?
''And if the claim is untrue, will you take action now to stop the NHS
being used in this way for such a con trick?''
Junior Scottish Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton replied: ''I
would deplore any material which could be construed as misinterpreting
the correct facts.'' The same criteria were used to categorise and
prioritise both NHS and private patients who needed urgent care or were
seriously ill, he said.
A Norwich Union spokesman said its literature had already been amended
to make clear that it was not able to guarantee fast access or direct
settlement of accounts for NHS pay beds.The company also was suspending
mail shots in Scotland and was reviewing its literature.

TORY chairman Jeremy Hanley last night appealed to the party's warring
Euro-factions not to attempt to tie the Prime Minister's hands behind
his back before next year's EU summit.
Negotiating effectively meant taking strong, defensible positions --
''not sewing ourselves into a straitjacket'', he said.
Mr Hanley spoke out on the eve of a keynote speech by the pro-European
Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke -- in which he is expected to set out
fresh obstacles to Britain joining a single currency.
Ministers have insisted the obstacles already were contained in the
smallprint of the Maastricht Treaty.
The Prime Minister is, on the one hand, refusing, as Euro-sceptics are
demanding, to rule out a single currency, while, on the other, trying to
assuage them by suggesting new conditions for entry.
Mr Hanley told a Conservative Group for Europe meeting in London that
no-one could be better in batting for Britain in the inter-governmental
conference on the future direction of Europe than Mr Major.
''None of us should think of trying to tie one hand behind his back
beforehand, still less two hands,'' Mr Hanley said.
''Remember, the PM secured the European Monetary Union opt-out.''
Meanwhile, Euro-rebel Sir Teddy Taylor fanned the flames of the single
currency row in Tory ranks when he issued a dire warning of the
consequences of monetary union.
''If we go ahead with stage two of economic and monetary union, which
I believe that the Treasury intends to do, our economic freedom and
national independence will largely fade away,'' the Southend East MP
said.
''The single currency and the procedures for securing it will prove to
be a costly nonsense securing nothing apart from gigantic subsidy and
total inflexibility,'' he added.
However, the Government was urged by the Liberal Democrats to end its
prevarication towards a single currency, and accept it was the ''logical
conclusion'' of Britain's economic ties to the Union.

Stephen McGregor describes the chaos which
accompanied a Scottish innovation at Westminster
CHAOS and confusion were the order of the day as the Scottish Grand
Committee met for the first time yesterday in its new form at
Westminster.
MPs, journalists and observers crammed into a committee room at the
Commons for the first session under the ''taking stock'' procedures,
which allow for 45 minutes of questions, a general debate and an
adjournment debate on a specific constituency interest.
Such was the pressure for space that a number of MPs could not find
seats and were forced to stand at the back.
Glasgow Hillhead Labour MP George Galloway tried to mark the
proceedings as ''a historic occasion,'' but made rather a mess of things
by forgetting the conventions of the House and not asking his main
question first.
However, he did manage to get in his comment that while the new
procedure was a step in the right direction, the journey would not be
completed until Scotland had a parliament of its own.
The occasion was also marked by the dismissal by committee chairman
Labour MP Michael Martin of the Scottish Tory Whip, Mr Michael Bates. Mr
Bates, MP for Langbaurgh, went round behind the chair and sat with the
civil servants.He was bluntly told by Mr Martin (Glasgow Springburn):
''You are not a member of the committee and you must leave.'' He nodded
to the chair and obeyed instructions.
Former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart -- who resigned on
Tuesday -- was, as promised, present on the back benches, sporting the
blue rosette of Eastwood on the lapel of his jacket, while his successor
to ministerial office, Mr George Kynoch, faced his first questions in
the hot seat.
The exchanges in the committee on serious political issues were
important but predictable. Amid the noise, Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson went on the attack over the job losses at Rolls-Royce
in East Kilbride.
Mr Robertson said that the loss of this key asset to the Scottish
economy would have a devastating impact and the Government's approach so
far had been characterised by ''complacency, indifference and paralysis
of action.''
However, the Government line was that, while Ministers regretted the
job losses, Labour continued to look at the downside of the Scottish
economy. Mr Kynoch, in what was an impressive debut, said: ''Alongside
the very disappointing job losses at Rolls-Royce, there has been a
significant increase in jobs in the East Kilbride area.''
Mr Kynoch said that Scottish Enterprise had been highly successful in
the number of jobs it had created and the assistance it had given to
companies.
Elsewhere, Mr Robertson was involved in an exchange with Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang about the water industry, referring to ''three more
placemen for the superquangos'' which was a ''flagrant display of
political patronage.''
Mr Lang told him: ''There is no doubt that the new authorities will
deliver services in the most efficient and cost-effective way.
The historic occasion was rounded off by Mr Galloway complaining that
it might have been held in a better room, such as the larger committee
room 14. Mr Martin was forced to explain to Mr Galloway that room 14 had
been commandeered for a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party.
* Some Scots Tory MPs suspect Labour of contributing to the shambles
by booking the larger committee room. Mr Bill Walker (North Tayside)
said: ''I believe they did this to undermine or attempt to undermine the
new system in the hope of encouraging support for their own costly
devolution plans. It shows they do not care about the good government of
Scotland.''

By Our Political Staff
REPUBLICANS yesterday blamed a British ''dirty tricks'' operation for
a bomb planted in Newry, County Down, claiming it was part of an attempt
to disrupt the Northern Ireland peace process.
So-called agents provocateurs unhappy with the political developments
were most likely to be responsible, Sinn Fein said.
The IRA yesterday categorically rejected Unionist claims -- and some
security force suspicions -- that it left the one-pound Semtex device at
the front of a DIY shopping centre in the border town.
Army explosives experts spent nearly five hours making it safe with
three controlled explosions. No-one was hurt.
Yesterday's developments came as the Government faced pressure from
Dublin to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, after the Republic's
Parliament voted to lift Ireland's State of Emergency provisions.
Downing Street said it was ''not persuaded'' that the powers provided
by the Act -- allowing for the detention of terrorist suspects for up to
seven days and the issuing of exclusion orders from mainland Britain --
were no longer needed.
However, there were reports last night that Home Secretary Michael
Howard is considering plans to drop the use of exclusion orders.
The Home Office said only that the Act was kept under constant review.
The likelihood of changes will become clearer as the Act comes up for
renewal in the Commons next month.
However, Mr James Cran, vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench
Northern Ireland committee, said it was not time to consider a response
to the Irish Government.
He said: ''This sort of debate is just a distraction apart form which
people like me would not wish to see amendments along the lines of the
Irish Government simply because both sides of the divide in Northern
Ireland have very considerable caches of armaments. We have got to those
decommissioned.''
The Newry bomb was the second to be defused since the start of the IRA
ceasefire just over five months ago.
Sinn Fein will meet senior civil servants at Stormont today in another
round of exploratory talks which could edge the party even closer to
full negotiations at ministerial level.
The party's northern chairman Mitchel McLaughlin claimed: ''Whoever
planted the device is not involved in the peace process and does not
want it to succeed.''
However, Democratic Unionist MP Peter Robinson said he was convinced
the Provisionals were behind the Newry device.
He added: ''It is part of the threat that they want to remind the
Government that unless they continue with their surrender they are
willing to go back to violence.''
At today's meeting at Stormont, Sinn Fein will call for an end to the
exploratory dialogue and a swift move into talks with Government
Ministers.
Provided ''good progress continues'' with the civil servants, it seems
the Government will be ready to meet them once the joint framework
document is published.
This outlines the basis of all-party negotiations on the future of
Northern Ireland and is due out before the end of the month.
Meanwhile, Unionists are preparing to resist any moves towards the
establishment of any cross-border bodies being proposed in the framework
document.
A special meeting involving representatives of Mr Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionist Party and Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist Party
is being held in Belfast tonight to agree on a joint strategy. However,
a new formal pact at this stage is unlikely, according to sources in
Belfast.

A DEALER involved in supplying nearly #48,000 worth of amphetamines
was jailed for six years yesterday at the High Court in Inverness.
The haul was discovered beside a track in the village of Foyers, on
the banks of Loch Ness.
Gary Follen, 34, of Glenlia, Foyers, had denied being concerned in the
supply of the drug at his home and elsewhere in March last year.
The amphetamines were wrapped in 58 individual bags inside two ice
cream tubs. They weighed 3915g. Previously the biggest amphetamine
seizure in the Highlands was 140g.
Follen had lodged a defence of incrimination, naming Allan Wade, of
Kanachrine Place, Ullapool.
He was called as a defence witness and changed his evidence after
being granted immunity from prosecution on drugs charges.
After initially denying any involvement, Mr Wade, 34, admitted
handling the amphetamines then concealing them without Follen knowing
anything about it. He denied trying to help Follen by giving that
evidence. But Follen's fingerprints were found on one of the ice cream
tubs.

A soldier was jailed for 10 years yesterday for the attempted murder
of a top republican in Belfast.
Andrew Brian Clarke fired 20 shots at mourners outside the home of
Thomas Begley, an IRA man who blew himself up in a bombing which killed
nine Protestants at a shop on the Shankill Road just days before in
October, 1993.
Mr Eddie Copeland was hit twice in the back and chest but recovered
after 13 days in hospital.
Trooper Clarke, 22, from Merseyside and serving with the 9th-12th
Lancers, had been on the back of a Land Rover when he fired.
He told police he had felt frustrated and angry when he saw suspected
terrorists walking the streets of Belfast laughing at soldiers.
Clarke had aimed his rifle at Mr Copeland and although he could see
blue smoke he could not remember firing the shots.
Jailing him for 10 years at Belfast Crown Court, Lord Justice Carswell
said he accepted the shots were fired in an aimed and controlled manner
but this was not a premeditated attack.
''This was not a planned or premeditated attack but one done on the
spur of the moment, prompted by an uncontrollable impulse.''
Trooper Clarke is single and worked in the Wirral for a local council
before joining the Army six years ago.
The court heard that he had fired two single shots and then removed
the safety catch before switching to automatic mode.
Clarke emptied a 20-shot magazine and was preparing to reload his
rifle when he was disarmed by other soldiers.
In court, the soldier apologised to the man he shot and said it was
unbelievable anything like that could happen.
Trooper Clarke had been on his second tour of duty in Ulster and had
previously served in South Armagh.
He had been on duty in the republican Ardoyne district, where mourners
had gathered to pay their respects to the family of Thomas Begley.
Lord Justice Carswell said: ''There can be no excuse for a soldier to
allow his frustration to boil over, lose his head and shoot at people in
the street when there was no possible justification in law.''

A ROW has broken out over the selection process for drawing up a short
leet of four candidates for the leadership of Scotland's fifth biggest
trade union.
They will be interviewed for the #48,000 post of general secretary of
the Educational Institute of Scotland tomorrow evening.
The appointment will be made by the union's 140-strong council, which
consists of elected members representing EIS local associations.
But some council members are unhappy about the ommission of Mr Fred
Forrester, EIS deputy general secretary, from the short leet, which
consists of full-time officials Mr Ronnie Smith and Mr Ian McKay, and
elected members Mr George MacBride and Mr Eric Young.
Mr Vincent Hanna, a council member who teaches at St Mary's primary in
Duntocher, Clydebank, has successfully lodged an objection to the
selection procedure used by the EIS executive, whose 24 elected members
are drawn from the council.
It will be debated before the council begins interviewing the
candidates and, if carried, the selection process would be immediately
postponed until April, when a short leet produced by a different method
would be interviewed.
A former EIS President, Mr Wolseley Brown, also formally objected, but
his submission -- which named Mr Forrester -- was ruled incompetent.
Last Friday, the EIS executive interviewed nine candidates on a long
leet for the job. Those candidates who secured the vote of a majority of
executive members made it on to the short leet.
Mr Hanna, who is secretary of the EIS Dunbartonshire association, but
who emphasised that he was speaking in a personal capacity, said he
opposed a method of selection which allowed the executive to choose
those whom it wanted and those whom it did not want on the short leet.
He said: ''They have deliberately chosen a method whereby they can
ensure that only the people they think should go forward will go
forward. They have reduced council members' choice.''
His objection calls on the council to disapprove of the procedure for
drawing up the short leet, to postpone making an appointment, and to ask
the executive to review the list of applicants, re-advertise if
necessary, and produce an alternative selection procedure.
He said he could call on at least five sponsors for his objection.
Mr Brown, an old ally of Mr Forrester, said: ''This seems to have been
an exercise to exclude certain people from the short leet.''
Mr Forrester said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the
matter.

THE value and quality of the works on display at the national
galleries in Edinburgh will not be diminished if the proposal to site a
new national gallery in Glasgow goes ahead.
This assurance was given in Edinburgh last night by Mr Angus Grossart,
chairman of the board of trustees of Scotland's art collection, at a
public meeting which was part of the trustees' consultation process for
their options for a National Gallery of Scotland in Glasgow.
Mr Grossart said: ''We have not embarked on a process to diminish the
value and quality of what is on display in Edinburgh. We believe we can
tell a story, jointly, without reducing the quality that exists in
Edinburgh.''
Mr Grossart said further proof of this was the fact that there was a
commitment for the two cities to work together.
''There is not going to be an element of competition between the two
but one of harmony. Glasgow District Council has given a guarantee to
give some of the Scottish paintings from its collection,'' he said.

GLASGOW'S Labour councillors yesterday outlined their plans to get rid
of #35m of cash reserves lying in the city council's bank accounts.
More than #18m will go on ensuring that there is no increase in the
city's council tax next year, council treasurer Gordon Macdiarmid said.
A further #8m will go towards funding Glasgow's reign as City of
Architecture in 1999 and the council will hand over at least #8m in
reserves to the new unitary authority which will replace Glasgow
District Council next April.
The spending plan, largely outlined in the council's budget which will
be approved tomorrow, in one step reduces Glasgow's controversial cash
reserves.
The Labour administration came under fire from senior Glasgow
Conservatives who claimed the money had been creamed off the budgets of
council departments to prepare a spending sweetener for this year's
local government elections.
Tory group leader Bill Aitken accused the Labour administration of
''systematically ripping off council tax payers by overbudgeting and
saving for a rainy electoral day.''
Those claims were described as ''laughable'' by Mr Macdiarmid.
He added: ''We are hoping for a standstill on the council tax as a
result of the prudent financial management carried out by this authority
despite the very heavy financial burdens central Government has imposed.
''Through careful management we are able to release #18m from our
reserves to achieve that tax freeze. This means that family budgets will
not be further burdened and the people of Glasgow will also benefit from
some improvements in services and a marginal increase in jobs.''

THE Princess of Wales's legal victory yesterday in her efforts to
protect her privacy shows her coming of age as an independent member of
the royal family.
Only hours after the announcement that former gym owner Bryce Taylor
and Mirror Group Newspapers had settled out of court over photographs of
her working out in a gym, she set the seal on her trip to Japan by
meeting Emperor Akihito.
The settlement means Princess Diana will not appear at the Royal
Courts of Justice in the Strand, central London, next Monday -- which
she had told friends she was determined to do if necessary.
She would have become the first member of the royal family to give
evidence in a court this century.
Her determination to protect her privacy stamps her authority on her
life after separation from her husband.
The Princess was said to be delighted at the settlement and its
vindication of her resolute stance.
The out-of-court settlement means the photographs showing the
33-year-old Princess in a leotard and cycling shorts can never be
published again.
A permanent injunction prevents further use of them. All copies and
negatives must be delivered to the Princess's lawyers for destruction.
The settlement was announced by solicitors Mishcon De Reya, who said
in a statement: ''Her Royal Highness is pleased that her determined
stance in defence of her right to privacy has been so completely
vindicated.''
The Princess's legal costs have been met, it is believed by MGN. It is
thought they could amount to #1m.
New Zealander Mr Taylor took the photos with a hidden camera at the LA
Fitness club in Isleworth, west London, in 1993. The payments he
received were frozen by the courts and he is forced to hand over the
money, believed to be about #300,000, to a charity of the Princess's
choice.
Also under the settlement Mr Taylor has apologised to the Princess.
MGN has repeated an apology it made shortly after the Sunday Mirror and
the Daily Mirror splashed the photographs over their front pages and
across several pages inside.
In a front-page story on the settlement in yesterday's Daily Mirror,
editor Colin Myler states: ''As soon as we realised that the Princess
had been offended by the pictures, we apologised to her for publishing
them.'' Mr Myler was editor of the Sunday Mirror at the time the
pictures were published.
The Mirror said that if the court proceedings had gone ahead it
''would have refused to have taken part in subjecting her'' to lengthy
cross-examination of her attitude towards privacy and photography.
The paper adds: ''After long negotiations, complicated by the fact
that Bryce Taylor is in New Zealand, he eventually agreed to submit to
the undertakings demanded by the Princess's lawyers.''
Mr Taylor was at his home in the suburbs of Auckland and said: ''I am
very pleased that the situation has been resolved amicably.''
Mr Taylor, who was receiving legal aid, is understood to be
unemployed.
Meanwhile, the Princess had a meeting with Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko for nearly an hour at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, marking her
stature as a member of the royal family in her own right.
The Princess, who attended Emperor Akihito's enthronement in 1990 with
her husband, was totally relaxed as she curtsied deeply to the imperial
couple before going inside the rather austere concrete palace.
Earlier, she had another informal meeting, said to be very friendly,
with Crown Prince Naruhito and his wife Princess Masako.
Had she given evidence in court, the Princess would have been the
first member of the royal family to enter the witness box since the
Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, in 1891.
He was supporting a friend who had brought a claim of slander over an
accusation that he had cheated at cards.

MURRAY RITCHIE, European Editor
in Brussels
A NEW breed of European supergrass is to be paid to inform on
fraudsters who rob the EU of billions of pounds every year, it was
disclosed yesterday.
The European Commission announced plans for stepping up the fight
against fraud, which mainly involves the misuse or illegal claiming of
farm subsidies inside the member states. The EU's Court of Auditors
reported last year that up to #10 billion a year, equal to one fifth of
all spending, could be misused or inadequately accounted for.
New laws are expected to be in place by the summer, Mrs Anita Gradin,
commissioner in charge of anti-fraud measures, told reporters. Her plans
were formally adopted by the commission yesterday at its weekly meeting.
''Fighting against fraud and misuse of community funds is of the
highest importance,'' she said.
Mrs Gradin announced that the commission's own anti-fraud squad is to
be extended from 50 to 80 personnel, while anti-fraud officers from
various commission departments will be brought under one roof for a
co-ordinated assault on the problem.
Much of the responsibility for detecting fraud will, however, remain
with the EU member states, where about 90% of offences take place.
Member states will also be largely responsible for the recovery of lost
community funds.
A freephone number will be set up for members of the public who know
of frauds being committed, and a payment system will be set up for
anonymous informers.

COMMITTAL proceedings in the case of alleged mass killer Rosemary West
were adjourned temporarily yesterday to allow legal discussions on
aspects of media reporting.
On the third day of the hearing at Dursley Magistrates' Court,
Gloucestershire, Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Mr Peter Badge said a
substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice had
arisen.
He made an order banning reports of the proceedings from being
distributed, made available or published by computer network or
otherwise the public in Great Britain.
Mr Badge has been hearing prosecution evidence to decide whether Mrs
West, 41, accused of 10 murders, should be sent for jury trial.
The hearing, which began on Monday, is covered by reporting
restrictions and details of the case cannot yet be published in Britain.
Mr Badge called members of the media into open court to read his order
under the Contempt of Court Act.
A crowd of mainly schoolchildren last night shouted at Mrs West as she
was driven away.
The hearing continues.

THE new Lord Provost of Glasgow will be 64-year-old grandfather Bailie
Tommy Dingwall. He defeated Bailie Alex Mosson to win the Labour
nomination which guarantees him the post when it is put before the
council on Friday.
Weeks of city chambers speculation ended when Mr Dingwall emerged from
a secret meeting of Labour councillors yesterday afternoon with a
six-vote victory over Bailie Mosson.
He said: ''I have been under pressure since I was told I would be
nominated. It is something that people can only dream about. And for me
it is a dream come true.''
Bailie Dingwall's deputy will be Councillor Jimmy Mutter, who defeated
Bailie Mosson 27 votes to 25.
The vacancy for the Lord Provost's position was created by the death
of Lord Provost James Shields in January. He was the second Glasgow Lord
Provost to die in office within two years.
''We have been unfortunate in the fact that the last two Lord Provosts
have died in office and didn't get a good run at the post,'' added
Bailie Dingwall.
''Both will be hard to follow, but I would like to bring some
happiness back to the city chambers.'' Bailie Dingwall, a former senior
shop steward at the Albion Motor Works, is married to Winifred. They
have two children, Drew and Alison, and grandchildren Nicola and
Christopher.
Bailie Dingwall will possibly serve the shortest official term of any
Glasgow Lord Provost, as the district council will be replaced by a new
unitary authority on April 1 next year.
Within hours of his election speculation was sweeping the council
corridors on whether the new Lord Provost will seek to extend his term
by standing as Lord Provost when the matter is dealt with in May.
It is known that council leader Pat Lally wants that job, and any
attempt to stand in his way could result in a major political clash.
Bailie Dingwall said: ''It is an unwritten law in here that, if
somebody has served the normal four-year term as Lord Provost, then that
is it.''
He would not speculate on whether his shortened term of office would
open the door for him to challenge for Lord Provost of the new authority
''I couldn't decide that. It wouldn't be my decision.''

THE Clydesdale Bank was accused yesterday of treating its employees
with contempt after it decided to implement a pay package which union
negotiators rejected earlier this week.
Talks with the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union broke down on
Monday without any agreement being reached in the pay dispute, and the
results of a strike ballot among Bifu's 4000 members on the staff are
due to be announced today.
However, the bank told employees yesterday that it was proceeding with
the pay package rejected by the union. Salary increases in keeping with
its individual performance pay programme would be made this month, it
said.
For ''satisfactory performers'', the increases would range from 3% to
7%. Those whose performance was less than satisfactory -- fewer than 10%
of employees -- would get no rise.
The bank described the package as fair, and said it was keen to press
ahead with the increases which already were overdue.
But Mr Keith Brookes, Bifu's assistant secretary, said: ''The
contemptuous tactics of Clydesdale in imposing their pay formula the day
before the ballot result is typical of the way they treat their staff --
with utter contempt.''
Union leaders say they are confident that the strike ballot will
produce an overwhelming result in favour of a series of one-day walkouts
to support Bifu's claim for a 6.75% rise for the majority of staff.
They say industrial relations have deteriorated since the Clydesdale
was taken over by the National Australia Bank in 1987. Pointing to
Clydesdale's record profits of #110m last year, they claim that the
parent company has been pushing UK staff harder to increase profits
without being prepared to reward them fairly.
The Clydesdale said yesterday that other elements in the pay package
included increases in salary ranges and special provision for some
employees who had recently moved to new positions.
The bank also operated a performance bonus scheme -- which the union
has branded ''arbitrary and divisive'' -- under which 60% of employees
had received payments in December.
In addition, a new employee share scheme providing staff with an
opportunity to buy shares in the National Australia Bank was being
introduced.
The bank said that individual performance pay had been introduced for
managerial staff in 1990 and had been extended subsequently to cover all
employees. There was an agreed annual review process, including
discussions with the union, and this process had ''now been completed''.

TRANSPORT Minister Steve Norris is at the centre of a row after he
dismissed public transport commuters as ''dreadful human beings''.
Mr Norris sparked an angry response when he praised the benefits of
private car travel by saying: ''You have your own company, your own
temperature control, your own music and don't have to put up with
dreadful human beings sitting alongside you.''
His remarks at a Commons committee inquiry into vehicle exhaust
pollution provoked an immediate protest from Labour.
The Shadow Transport Secretary, Mr Michael Meacher, said: ''This is a
gross insult to public transport users and shows the deeply held Tory
belief in a two-tier society -- whether health, education or transport
services.
''It also speaks volumes about the sincerity of Ministers' claims to
want to improve public transport.
''Perhaps they have taken to heart the warnings of the Maples
memorandum that a 'them and us' feeling is growing throughout the
nation. Perhaps Ministers are afraid to travel on public transport?''
Mr Norris told MPs the private car was ''extraordinarily convenient,''
and rejected the case for government spending vast sums of money on
alternative public systems.
The Minister said it was a delusion to think delivering safe,
efficient and reliable public transport was the answer to the problems
of traffic pollution.
He said oil companies would have to raise petrol prices by 2p a litre
if forced to reduce carcinogenic benzene levels in fuel. But new exaust
emission controls would be in force by 2010 reducing UK pollution by
two-thirds.
''The reality is that most benzenes occur as a result of combustion in
the engine, so cutting emissions is far more effective,'' Mr Norris
said.
Expensive public transport systems were not the answer as people were
unwilling to sacrifice their cars to save the environment.
Mr Norris, who has responsibility for transport in London, also caused
anger among environmental groups who are staging a high profile campaign
against motorway building.
Air pollution campaigner Fiona Weir, of Friends of the Earth, said:
''It is incredibly disappointing that Steve Norris has under-estimated
how much better and more pleasant public transport could be if
government were to invest properly in bringing it up to the standards of
continental systems.''
The Minister's comments on the benefits of car ownership come at a
particularly sensitive time as several recent reports have warned of the
hazards of petrol pollution.

OPPOSITION MPs have threatened the Government with legal action if
there is no formal consultation into the future of the Motorail and Fort
William sleeper services before their threatened closure in May.
This follows yesterday's meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee where
Scottish Office Minister Sir Hector Monro clearly indicated that such
consultation would take place.
Shortly afterwards, however, the Scottish Office cast doubt on the
extent of the Minister's commitment when a spokesman said: ''Our
position has not changed. There is an obligation for full consultation
on the proposals of the director of rail franchising which will be
published in May.''
Franchise director Mr Roger Salmon, made clear in December that he
would no longer protect the Motorail and sleeper services with subsidy.
As a result neither service would appear in timetables after May, nor
indeed in Mr Salmon's proposals.
There was anger last night at what appeared to be a Scottish Office
suggestion that Sir Hector had been misunderstood.
Labour's Trade and Industry Spokesman Mr Brian Wilson, who first drew
the commitment from Sir Hector in the debate yesterday, told The Herald:
''If the Government now tries to renege on Sir Hector's commitment they
will face judicial review because what a Minister of the Crown says in
parliamentary committee has the force of law.
''I specifically asked whether there would be formal consultation
before the services were withdrawn. Not some loose exercise but a formal
consultation under the Railway Act. I pursued it because it had to be
made clear and Sir Hector said there would be such a consultation. The
record will show that.
''Given Sir Hector's commitment we will now be asking the rail
regulator to ensure that these services continue at least until this
formal consultation is completed.''
Mr Wilson's recall of events was supported by most present at the
committee including Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat MP for
Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber.
A delegation from Highland Regional Council had travelled on the
threatened sleeper to attend yesterday's meeting of the Scottish Grand
Committee at Westminster. Later, the convener of Highland Regional
Council, Mr Duncan McPherson, and Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP Mr Charles
Kennedy, met with Highlands and Islands Minister Lord James Douglas
Hamilton, where the Minister made no attempt to qualify Sir Hector's
commitment.
Indeed, after yesterday's meeting Mr Kennedy told a news conference:
''We left with the clear impression that Lord James and the Scottish
Office would be putting pressure on to maintain these services right
through the consultation period which is good news for the forthcoming
tourist season.
''It would be a blatant act of bad faith to take any services off now
in the light of what was said this morning.''
Last night Scotrail, which will shortly take over the sleeper services
but have said they cannot run one to Fort William without a #3m subsidy,
issued a statement reacting to Sir Hector's comments.
It said: ''We obviously have a duty to honour commitments made by the
Government. At this stage we do not know how long the consultation
process will take and we expect to receive more detailed information
from the Secretary of State's office in due course.''
A spokesman later confirmed to The Herald that if the consultation ran
into the summer timetable the company would be seeking financial support
from the Government.
The Highland delegation, meanwhile, boarded the Fort William sleeper
last night in good heart despite the apparent confusion within
Government as to what commitment had been made.
* Dr John McCormick, chairman of the Scottish Association for Public
Transport, has claimed in a letter to Transport Secretary Dr Brian
Mawhinney, that withdrawing support for the sleeper service will
effectively lead to the closure of track from Cowlairs East Junction to
the junction at Cowlairs North, as the sleeper is currently the only
scheduled passenger service using that line.
A ScotRail spokesman insisted last night, however, that any withdrawal
of the sleeper would not necessarily lead to the closure of the line.

More than seven in 100
of Scotland's population
hail from south of the
Border and obviously
have strong feelings
about their host
country's aspirations.
How do they express them?
Gavin Bell talks to
a few to find out
IF ENGLISHMEN still regard their homes as castles, Scotland has
probably more Anglo-Saxon fortifications today than at any time since
the Duke of Cumberland crushed early Scottish nationalist aspirations in
1746.
At the last count (in 1991), there were 354,268 English people living
north of the Border, representing more than seven per cent of the
population. Judging by their views on the devolution issue, however, the
majority are here as friends and sympathisers rather than as defenders
of the Union.
A random sample interviewed by The Herald indicates that many are
broadly supportive of a Scottish Assembly, believing that it is high
time Scotland was allowed to manage its own affairs. Few appear to share
Mr Major's concerns about the fate of the Union, and most believe
Scotland would benefit from more direct relations with Europe.
Terry Butcher, the former Rangers footballer who hails from Lowestoft,
enjoyed a love-hate relationship with Scottish supporters, dictated by
their respective loyalties to Glasgow's two principal clubs. The balance
was favourable, however, because when he retired from football he
returned to Scotland with his family last year to buy a small hotel at
Bridge of Allan.
''We came back because the four years I spent with Rangers were the
happiest of my life,'' he says. ''We have a lot of friends here, we love
the area and the way of life, and the warmth and friendliness of the
people in the village is very special. We've put down roots here, and I
can't imagine wanting to live anywhere else.''
Mr Butcher is not certain that devolution is the panacea for
Scotland's ills, but he firmly believes it should be given a chance: ''I
feel the Scots people have been hard done by in the past, and that it
makes sense for them to have a say in running their own country. Many
people in England have a false impression of Scotland, which they see
vaguely as a cloudy, misty land full of kilted caber-tossers. So I think
it would be far better if Scotland's destiny was decided by its people,
rather than by others far away who have little idea what the country is
really like.''
In his new role as a businessman, he has reservations about the price
Scotland might have to pay for autonomy. ''On the whole I think it could
be good for the country, but I'm concerned it might lead to more taxes.
From the business point of view, that's just what Scotland doesn't need.
What it needs is jobs, prosperity, and business incentives.''
Mr Butcher is also wary of Labour proposals, describing himself as
''about the only Tory left in Scotland''. However he does not share Mr
Major's view that separation would precipitate a flight of English and
foreign capital. ''I don't see that happening, unless they impose
specific taxes on foreigners which is unlikely. Foreign businessmen have
added a lot to the stability, wealth and outlook of the country, and its
future leaders should appreciate that they need to encourage such
investments.''
He does, however, share Conservative concerns about the fate of the
Union. ''I hope it survives in one form or another. History has shown
that in times of conflict and hardship, people are stronger when they
stick together. I know the Union is under strain, but I would be sad to
see it breaking up.''
On a subject on which he speaks with some authority, the ex-Rangers
star doubts whether devolution would benefit Scottish football,
currently the focus of much soul-searching about a perceived lack of
skills and imagination.
There is a danger, he says, that the small foreign legion in its ranks
could be diminished. ''Sport is like business, in the sense that it
benefits from the presence of foreigners. I'm afraid that independence
could limit the number of foreign players Scots clubs would be allowed
in European competitions, and that some home-grown talent might want to
leave to play in the big championships elsewhere. So I'm not so sure it
would be good for the game here.''
As the manager of a prominent English bank in Glasgow, David Grimshaw
from Leeds has a discreet finger on Scotland's fiscal pulse -- and he
considers the economic climate and conditions are right for Scotland to
stand on its own feet.
''Personally, I feel Scotland should be given the opportunity to
decide its own destiny and manage its own economy. The country is
under-developed, and because of the decline of its traditional heavy
industries there are support bodies in place for encouraging growth in
other directions. The infrastructure is there for building on, far more
than in some English regions, and in the past year I have seen more
optimism and confidence in creating new businesses and seeking new
markets.
''At the same time the number of business failures is diminishing
noticeably. There is no question that Scotland is now leaner and fitter
in economic terms.''
Mr Grimshaw believes that devolution would also stimulate trade:
''Rather than having to rely on central government initiatives to
compete on world markets, Scotland could identify its own markets and
negotiate its own trading terms. There may be a price to pay for the
reorganisation in the short term, say over two or three years, but I
would expect taxes to rise under a Labour government anyway.
''The essential point is that historically Scotland has always been a
proud, stand-alone nation, and I don't honestly think it gets a fair
crack of the whip at Westminster.''
On a personal note, the banker says his transfer to Scotland was his
best career move so far. ''This is a relaxed place to live, the natives
are friendly, and the quality of life is far better than in many urban
areas down south. I like to think I'm very positive about Scotland.''
Helen Price from Lincolnshire quit a high-powered job as an
advertising executive in London to follow her Scottish boyfriend to a
farm cottage near Kirkintilloch, and a new career as a veterinary
assistant. She agrees that Scotland has not been well served by the
mandarins of Whitehall or by English-based companies:
''I think the people in England in charge of Scottish affairs have no
idea what life is like in Scotland. This country is treated like a
region, and the resources allocated to it are not commensurate with the
population. At least with devolution, we would have people running the
Scottish economy who understand Scottish problems.''
Ms Price does not believe that punitive taxes are inevitable, and
suggests that substantial public funds are being wasted anyway by
executives in London who do not understand the issues they are trying to
tackle north of the border. She also doubts that English and overseas
businessmen would flee for safer havens:
''On the contrary, I believe that, given the opportunity to manage its
own economy, Scotland would be able to offer more to potential
investors.''
Nor is she unduly concerned about the possible disintegration of the
Union: ''I think it would be better for Scotland to be independent, even
if it means the break-up of the Union, because I don't believe English
rules apply to a Scottish society. An independent Scotland would have a
lot to offer anyone who chooses to live here. It would stand alone, and
be the nation it's been fighting to be.''
From his bungalow on the Isle of Skye, retired scientist Peter Barham
has a splendid view over the Sound of Sleat to the hills of Knoydart.
Having forsaken his native East Anglia, he can think of nowhere else he
would rather be, and he would be quite happy to live under a Scottish
government.
''I am very sympathetic to devolution. I do feel there is far too much
centralised government in the UK, and I would like to see a Scottish
Assembly as part of moves towards a federalised structure also involving
regions of England and Wales. Having said that, one of the tragedies of
the world today is its splintering into tribalism, and I would like to
think there is still a place for an autonomous Scotland within the UK.
''The only possible problem with devolution might be an antagonistic
response from Westminster, but frankly I can't see any reason for that.
Whatever happens, I very definitely wish to remain here. And if it came
to a fight for Scottish rights, my arm would be with them.''
Ann McKenna from Berkshire is not so sure. As the wife and business
partner of a financial consultant in Kilmacolm, she is concerned that
more bureaucracy will lead to higher taxes with no guarantees of more
effective government.
''It depends on whether there are enough benefits after the bills are
paid, and frankly I don't think Scotland will get enough out of it. I'm
afraid it might be just another tier of government with a higher level
of expense. And in European terms, I'm not sure that a smaller voice
would have a bigger say. Scotland on its own would not have the same
pull in political and economic terms. On the whole, I think devolution
would create problems rather than solutions.''
Michael Holroyd from Manchester, the regional manager of a drinks
company in Lanarkshire, takes a similar view: ''I don't see what
benefits Scotland could expect without incurring extra costs. It seems
to me like just another layer of management which would be very
confusing for everybody. In economic terms, the trend in sales and
marketing is towards pan-European and global products rather than
national brands, so Scotland might suffer there.
''I do appreciate London is a long way from Scotland, and maybe London
needs to come to Scotland more. My own view is that it would be better
to improve the present system of consultation and decision-making than
to break it up.''
Ray Gibson from Durham is more sanguine about devolution. As a press
officer with Aberdeen District Council, he has observed the North Sea
oil and gas boom at close hand and sees no reason why Scots should not
have a greater share of it.
''In general I support devolution. It seems the vast majority of
people here vote Labour, and yet Conservative views in Westminster have
been imposed on them. I believe Scots are entitled at least to decide
for themselves whether they wish to run their own affairs.''
Mr Gibson dismisses suggestions that foreign capital would abandon an
autonomous Scotland: ''Businessmen go where there is money to be made,
and practically every month there is somebody relocating to the Aberdeen
area. I don't see devolution changing that.''
Nor does he see himself fleeing back across the border if the Saltire
was raised above a Scottish Assembly. ''In the street where I live there
are French, Norwegians and other nationalities, and I have never heard
anyone even suggesting they might leave if devolution came along. We
like it here.''
An English executive, who asked not to be named, put it another way:
''We often find it difficult to persuade our English staff to come to
Scotland, but those who do come love it. It's a nice secret to keep.''

THE poll shows the very high levels of solid support for independence
-- some of which lie in the most surprising places. Scotland has not
been swayed by Mr John Major's smears or Mr George Robertson's fears.
In response to a significant new question regarding attitudes to
independence for Scotland, 47% of those questioned are in favour of
independence with only 21% very much against.
Many Scots are firmly behind the Scottish National Party's policy of
independence in Europe and, for many others, who are not yet SNP voters
devolution is only a process, not a final event. They want to reach the
same independence goal.
Support for the status quo remains in the doldrums despite -- perhaps
because of -- Mr Major's prophecies. Even 21% of Tories support
independence now. Across the parties, more and more Scots are quite
relaxed about the break-up of Britain.
Mr Robertson's ''mission to save the Union'' is also in disarray.
Astonishingly, he has failed to convince half of his own supporters.
Fifty per cent of Labour voters are in favour of independence and for
them devolution is merely a flag of convenience.
Far from devolution ''killing off the SNP'', as Mr Robertson claims,
his own supporters may well kill off devolution as the independence
option becomes more and more popular.

Robbie Dinwoodie analyses new figures that show three out of four
Scots support devolution
IS A Scottish Parliament to be or not to be? Or did the English bard
get it right in his Scottish Play in voicing a cry taken up by
latter-day Tories, that the debate is an irrelevance, change
unnecessary, new structures pointless?
To politicians, journalists, and broadcasters who have kept the debate
going over the years, it can be a little disheartening to note how scant
has been the impact of our interventions. In comparison to the
fluctuating fortunes of individual parties, popular opinion on the
constitutional issue has been remarkably consistent.
A constant figure of one fifth or less have been content with the
status quo, making a mockery of the Government mandate over the last 15
years. The rest want change, with the safer ground of a devolved
Parliament the preferred choice.
But beneath the surface of these steady lines on a graph, there are
shifts. Tories yearn for independence. Labour supporters defend the
Union. Among SNP voters are those trying to squeeze out a better deal on
devolution. Many want devolution but not if they have to pay extra for
it. Some natural constituencies have shifted across the fault lines of
party allegiance.
Above all, the future may be an uncertain landscape but it is not one
that seems to frighten people by its strangeness. Short-term, people may
be natural gradualists, tapping their way forward with a political white
stick, more concerned with jobs and hospital beds than debates on Calton
Hill.
Long-term, they seem to be more open to change. When Mr John Major's
apocalyptic vision of devolution slouching towards separation is put to
people, they see not a nightmare but a possibility, maybe even an
opportunity. Those able to accept the idea of an island of disparate
nations total 47%, those against only 35%. If it is a slippery slope, it
is one many seem to be prepared to attempt.
What would influence people in choosing their party vote in the event
of a snap poll? Asked to choose from a list of public concerns,
non-Conservatives put jobs and unemployment top of the list, with the
SNP and Lib Dems close to the 32% average on this, Labour at 40%, and
Tories on 11%.
Next priority was the NHS and hospitals, a concern of 24% on average,
with Labour and SLD making it a higher priority, Conservatives lower,
and SNP in between. Education and schools came next on 16%, highest for
SLD, with Labour next, and Conservatives and SNP making it a lower
priority, perhaps reflecting the private sector choice of one and the
historical satisfaction with the Scots system of the other.
Only then, at 15% and fourth in the table, came independence or
devolution, a priority for just 4% of Conservatives, 8% of Labour
supporters, 13% among SLD voters, and 47% of SNP followers. Next came
questions of the economy, where issues such as inflation and recession
pushed it to 27% among Conservatives, in contrast to the other parties
who clustered round an average concern of 14%.
Below that, came housing and homelessness on 11%, a lower priority for
Conservatives than others, and law and order on 9%, with SLD voters most
concerned. Other issues that made 7% were income tax and council tax.
The fact that Labour's commitment to a Scottish Parliament is of
greater importance to the party's leaders and activists than to its
voters has long been known, but the fact that only 8% volunteered it as
a priority, compared to 40% voicing concern about unemployment, may come
as a surprise.
Although, unprompted, it may not be a top priority, the issue of
Scottish self-government does rear up when beckoned. Asked,
specifically, how important it was in people's decision on casting their
party vote, 18% said it was the most important issue and 39% said it was
important but not the main issue. Some 15% said it was not at all
important and 22% said it was not very important.
The 18% figure appears to correlate to the bedrock support for
outright independence, but it is one issue fighting for attention among
many concerns. Mr Chris Eynon, of System Three, said: ''At is simplest,
if there is popular for support for some form of self-government for
Scotland in principle, then there are other issues which are of greater
importance to the Scottish electorate in determining how they vote in
General Elections.''
A feature of The Herald's polls is how remarkably stable Scottish
opinion has been on the constitutional issue over the last decade. The
September 1985 figures for independence (29%), devolution (44%), and the
status quo (21%) are almost identical to today's of 29%, 47% and 20%.
One underlying difference between broadly similar figures across the
gap of 10 years is that Liberals have become markedly less likely to
support full independence (down from 20% to 7%), and Labour support for
that position has also fallen (from 35% to 29%), changes reflecting the
more worked-out Scottish Constitutional Convention scheme.
Home-rule support has therefore grown from 41% to 54% among Labour
voters, and from 54% to 77% between the Liberals of 1985 and their SLD
successors. Tories, devolution champions a decade ago at 47%, have
fallen to 30%.
Tories will point to the high-water marks of 1986 (34%-46%-15%) and
1993 (31%-50%-16%) to claim that the current is now running their way,
but the consistency of the figures makes their moral position scarcely
tenable, and the pro-devolution figure remains the second highest ever.
But what are we to make of the following facts? That 11% of Tories
want independence and 30% are home-rulers, that 29% of Labour voters
actually want independence, that 36% of SNP supporters put devolution
ahead of sovereignty? That Liberal Democrats have least liking for
independence (7%) but the greatest desire for home rule (77%) is at
least consistent with their federal approach.
There is a storm warning in our poll, however, for the leaders of both
Labour and the SLD as partners in the Scottish Constitutional Convention
plan for a Scottish Parliament with tax-raising powers. When the
identical options are prefaced by a caveat about higher taxes, their
voters' support for the plan is seen to be soft.
General support for a devolved Parliament falls 10 points, from 47% to
37%, with a swing directly to the status quo position, up 10 points to
30%. Faced with more taxation, Labour support drops 10 points to 44% and
SLD by 21 points to 56%.
Labour's Mr George Robertson and the SLD's Mr Jim Wallace may have to
ask themselves whether the right of their proposed Scottish Parliament
to vary income tax by 3p in the pound, which even the scheme's
supporters concede is far more likely to raise than lower the tax,
appears on our evidence to be an electoral millstone.
Supporters of independence, in contrast, seem impervious to direct
economic warnings. Overall support falls just one point to 28% in spite
of any taxation threat. Tories are most scared off, down five points to
6%. Labour supporters of independence fall by just one point to hold at
28%. SNP voters firm up by one point to 59%, and SLD independence
supporters go up three points to 10%.
Scots appear to be torn between what they would be prepared to vote
for tomorrow, and what they might be prepared to see in the future -- to
the extent that 47% appear to be in favour of the break-up of the UK,
compared to 35% who are against.
We asked the question in a way which shows that in thrusting the
constitutional debate up the agenda, the Prime Minister may have opened
a Pandora's Box, inside which had lain dormant much more daring Scottish
attitudes than we would have expected to find there.
We asked: ''John Major has said that the setting up of separate
Assemblies for Scotland and Wales will ultimately lead to a break-up of
the United Kingdom. What are your views on England, Scotland, and Wales
becoming independent countries, each governed separately?''
Conservative Central Office must have expected that such an explicitly
scary question would make voters run a mile but, instead, 26% said they
were ''very much in favour'' of this scenario, while 21% were ''slightly
in favour''. Those neither for nor against amounted to 13%, while those
''slightly against'' amounted to 14% and those ''very much against''
totalled 21%.
This potential tide for change is not matched south of the Border as
yet. This is revealed in an extensive Herald/System Three poll conducted
across England, which we will publish tomorrow. This shows just 8% very
much in favour of the break-up and 17% slightly in favour. The
uncommitted total 23%, those mildly against amount to 18% and those very
much against come out at 26%. A 47:35 ratio in favour of change in
Scotland translates as a 44:25 opposition to change in the South.
These same ratio figures (contrasting all those in favour with all
those against) make interesting reading when applied in Scotland on a
party political breakdown. These show the mood for changes as SNP (78:13
in favour of the break-up), Labour (50:32 in favour), SLD (52:30
against), and Conservative (71:21 against).
The statistic that 47% of Scots seem to be in favour, at least in the
long run, of ending the Union and, as Mr Alex Salmond will no doubt put
it, the granting of independence to England, Wales, and Scotland, is one
we can expect to hear repeated. The downside for the SNP is that we seem
to aspire to change while being frightened of voting for it.

Current support for a Scottish Parliament of some kind stands at 76%
(independence 29%, devolution 47%), with 20% supporting status quo.
This is slightly down on the 81% peak two years ago (31% independence,
50% devolution, 16% no change) but close to the consistent figures of
the last 10 years.
Independence support remains firm even if higher taxes were the result
(28%).
On the general concept of the break-up of the United Kingdom into
independent nations, 47% of Scots supported the idea (26% were very much
in favour and 21% slightly in favour), compared to 35% against (14%
slightly, 21% very much).
According to an exclusive poll conducted in England, to be carried by
The Herald tomorrow, the equivalent support in the South for breaking up
the UK is 25% (8% very much in favour, 17% slightly so).

TORY MP Teresa Gorman yesterday defended her #300,000 home against the
local Labour-controlled council's planning committee.
Mrs Gorman and her husband, Jim, face more than 60 charges of breaking
planning laws when restoring Old Hall Farm in Orsett, a rural backwater
in suburban Essex.
Last night Thurrock Council ratified the planning committee's decision
despite a move from the tiny Tory group. The Conservative group leader,
Ray Andrews, brought a motion disapproving of the court action, which he
said was going to cost a lot of money. But a vote on his motion was lost
by 25 votes to four.
Enforcement notices have already been issued.
A demonstration by Mrs Gorman's supporters outside the council meeting
was called off because of the rain. But Mrs Gorman opened her house, a
timber-framed 15th century farmhouse, to reporters. She accused council
officers of deliberately leaking material to the press and failing to
tell the Gormans about breaches of planning regulations.

AN AWARD-winning hospital housing more than 120 elderly patients is

approved.
Health watchdogs reacted angrily yesterday after hearing that
Mearnskirk Hospital, Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, is under offer to a
consortium of house-builders. Greater Glasgow Health Board has already
sold most of the land around the hospital for a development of 395
houses in a deal estimated at #40m.
Closure of the hospital itself -- which stands on the remainder of the
site -- is among the options put out for public consultation by the
health board in December as part of their plan for Care in the
Community, drawn up with Strathclyde Regional Council.
However, another option calls for the retention of a 40-bed unit for
long-stay care on the same site. The consultation process is not
complete but yesterday the board admitted that the land was ''under
offer'' to the consortium comprising Ambion Homes, John Dickie, and
Bryant.
The deal allows the board continued occupation of the hospital itself
until 1998, the proposed closure date. In the meantime, it said it had
retained a separate site on which it would build a 40-bed unit if the
option to continue services at Mearnskirk was approved.
''The present buildings would not be suitable for use beyond that
time,'' said a spokesman.
However, the secretary of the South-East Glasgow Local Health Forum,
Mrs Margaret Hinds, said the frail, elderly residents were set to spend
the next three years living in the middle of a building site.
''How can they expect to look after people in the middle of all
that?'' she said. ''This comes so close to selling people's beds from
under them. It is a disgrace.''
The most modern part of the hospital, the Rosewood Ward, was built
only 15 years ago and last year received a Good Health award presented
by the Local Health Council and The Herald's sister paper, the Evening
Times.
The health council secretary, Mr Danny Crawford, said: ''I had been
aware that land at Mearnskirk was being sold off but I had not been
aware of the extent until our last visit there. The health council
agreed last night to express its serious concern that Mearnskirk is
effectively being closed without proper consultation.''
The housebuilding consortium -- Ambion Homes, John Dickie &amp; Sons, and
Bryant -- confirmed that it acquired the main hospital site from Greater
Glasgow Health Board more than one year ago. Outline planning permission
had already been gained by the health board for around 390 houses on the
site.
A spokesman for the consortium said yesterday that it was still
involved in informal discussions with the district council over plans
for the housing development. He declined to comment further until this
matter had been resolved with the planning authorities.
* In another property deal, the health board is planning to sell off
its own headquarters in Ingram Street. They have decided to move back to
offices in Bath Street which they have on a long-term lease and vacated
in 1988 in a #1m-a-year money-spinning sub-lease to Britoil.

LACK of security for #4m in old notes awaiting incineration took a
banker aback, the High Court in Glasgow was told yesterday.
Mr Thomas Porteous said that after he had seen how the notes were kept
in the basement of the Clydesdale Bank's Glasgow offices he phoned the
chief inspector to complain.
He said he was shocked that a single individual had control over the
vault.
Mr Hector MacGillivray, 54, a senior bank manager, of Thomson Drive,
Bearsden, denies embezzling #163,000 over 20 years.
The jury has heard an alleged tape-recorded interview of him in which
he is said to have confessed to police that he took between #300 and
#600 a week while in charge of the bank's ''burning section''.
Bank workers who complained about allegedly seeing him pocketing money
were told to ''get on with their work'', the court has heard.
The trial continues.

GLASGOW asbestos victim John Birnie was awarded #40,000 compensation
-- and had #29,000 clawed back by the Government.
Another Glasgow man was awarded #30,000. The Compensation Recovery
Unit took #28,000.
And a solicitor yesterday attacked the ''callous'' Government
legislation which claims cash from compensation paid to victims of
workplace negligence.
The case of Mr Birnie, 67, from Nitshill, Glasgow, was highlighted at
Glasgow Airport yesterday by Clydeside Action on Asbestos (CAA), before
a delegation left to give evidence to a Commons social security select
committee. The group wants the CRU abolished.
It has already managed to have an inquiry set up into the operation of
the CRU, set up in 1989 to recoup state benefits paid out while a
compensation claim was being considered.
The unit is said to be recovering more than #100m a year from
compensation paid for injuries ranging from bomb injuries to asbestosis.
Mr Birnie, who worked as an apprentice plumber and shipyard labourer
for about six years during the 1950s and 1960s.
He said it took about 30 years for the damage to his lungs to become
apparent. He gave up work seven years ago because of his health and was
awarded his compensation last July.
Mr Birnie said: ''If the Compensation Recovery Unit believes it has a
right to the money, why get it from me? Why not get it back from my
employers who made me the way I am today?''
Mr Frank Maguire, of Glasgow-based solicitors Robin Thompson and
Partners, who led the delegation, said the law was callous.
''It is harsh and oppressive to make these deductions from the limited
compensation payable to former asbestos workers who are suffering
serious, painful and life-threatening conditions,'' the solicitor said.
''These victims are entitled to sick pay, invalidity benefit and
industrial disablement benefit because they paid tax and National
Insurance contributions through their working lives.''
But Mr Maguire did not appear over-optimistic about any change of
heart on the Government's part.

CHILDREN chosen for their ability to overcome difficulties or for
helping others received McDonald's Child of Achievement Awards
yesterday.
This year nearly 10,000 youngsters from all over the country were
nominated, often by their teachers, and 150 received awards.
Gemma Stevenson, eight, of Irvine in Ayrshire, was born 13 weeks
prematurely, and has had to have three valves in her head. She suffers
from epilepsy, tunnel vision, and has a duodenal ulcer, but despite all
this Gemma remains a happy, loving little girl, who is an example to
everyone.
She now manages to attend a special needs school, and for the year
before she joined, was given home tuition to prepare for her big day.
At playtime she has to wear a special helmet to protect her head in
case she falls, but other than that, she wants to approach school life
with a very positive attitude, joining in everything her classmates do.
The organisers of the awards -- now in their 13th year -- concede that
narrowing the winners down to 150 was difficult.
Many of the children, ranging from four to 16, suffer from a
disability -- often a rare syndrome with a complicated name.
What makes them special is their pluckiness, cheerfulness and
enthusiasm and eagerness to help others less fortunate.
Chris Morris, 11, from Ilfracombe in Devon, decided to shave his hair
off in sympathy with his nine-year-old friend Anthony, who has been
undergoing intensive treatment for leukemia, and get sponsored at the
same time.
''A lot of people called me baldy,'' said Chris, ''but I quite liked
being bald.''
Chris, a pupil at Ilfracombe College, raises funds for the charity
CLIC (Cancer and Leukemia in Children).
Each of the 150 winners received a certificate and a trophy, presented
by a host of celebrities at a ceremony at London's QEll Conference
Centre.

THE proposed closure of Lenzie Hospital was driven by land speculation
on the part of Greater Glasgow Health Board, Labour MP Tom Clarke
claimed yesterday during the Scottish Grand Committee at Westminster.
He said: ''The health board sees closure of a hospital as an
opportunity to sell the land to housebuilders and thereby improve their
resources. If the Minister does not get on the phone and tell the GGHB
that this is not acceptable, then the Minister will be making an
unforgiveable mistake.''
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said the matter still was up for public
consultation on the Joint Community Care Plan, and that the board would
consider all responses lodged with it by March 6.
He told the committee: ''The GGHB position on future care is
unequivocal. No current Lenzie Hospital resident will be discharged
outwith NHS continuing care unless the resident exercises that choice.
''If the final outcome . . . is a recommendation from the health board
that Lenzie Hospital should close . . . then all residents would be
offered alternative care appropriate to their needs at either Stobhill
Hospital or Fourhills Nursing Home.
''In such circumstances closure would not be immediate and you may be
assured that the needs of the residents would dictate the eventual
closure date.''

THE managing director of a construction company squandered millions
fishing for sunken treasure as his business fell apart, it was claimed
yesterday.
Anthony Budge, a Tory activist who has entertained Ministers at his
home, sailed his #2m yacht as the company went under with debts of
#96.6m, it was alleged at Leeds County Court.
The Official Receiver said that he also ''lost'' in accountancy terms
the cost of building a swimming pool for horses and a rifle range within
the grounds of his home, Osberton Hall, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, by
including it in the price of constructing a by-pass.
Mr Budge, 55, his wife Janet, and fellow director Michael Yates, of
Mire Lane, Sutton-cum-Lound, Retford, Nottinghamshire, were accused of
misappropriation of funds and dishonesty.
They face being banned as directors of any company for seven years.
Mr Budge was managing director and chairman of A F Budge Ltd, a
holding group which owned trading companies including A F Budge
Contractors Ltd.
But on December 9, 1992, the company went into liquidation and some
months later -- the same day that his brother Richard bought large
tracts of the British coal industry -- the Department of Trade and
Industry began legal proceedings against him.
Mr Mark Cawson, counsel for the Official Receiver, said they found
#25m had been dishonsetly loaned and invested.
Mr Cawson said the company, in which the Budge family owned 99% of the
shares, failed to keep proper accounts and funds were diverted to The
Janet Budge Settlement Trust and other family interests.
Improvements worth #152,000 plus VAT were carried out on Osberton Hall
-- the horse pool and rifle range -- and the money hidden in the cost of
building the Newark bypass, he said. Own of Mr Budge's interests was
breeding horses, and the pool was to keep them fit.
It was also alleged that #900,000 was transferred from the company
pension and life assurance schemes to keep the company afloat.
One ''hobby'' they indulged in was called Value Resources Ltd, a
Bermudan-registered company.
''The primary objective of this company seems to have been to operate
a yacht used for the benefit of Mr and Mrs Budge and his family and also
a speculative investment in hunting for sunken sea treasure,'' said Mr
Cawson.
The yacht cost more than #2m -- and #5.5m failed to find one gold
doubloon, he said.
Another company, A F Budge Military Ltd, spent #8.27m collecting
tanks, guns, and a Scud missile.
Mr Peter Irvin, for the respondents, said they denied the allegations
and questioned why only the three of them were appearing in court.
A host of highly paid professionals had cost the company #8m in fees
and they had found nothing wrong with the operation, he said.
The hearing was adjourned for the respondents to call witnesses.

A SHERIFF yesterday saved the life -- at least temporarily -- of a dog
called Slitz, when he found it proved that the five-year-old bitch was
not a pit bull terrier, and criticised the legislation on dangerous dogs
as ''most curious''.
The decision by Sheriff Nigel Thomson at Peebles Sheriff Court
delighted her owner, bricklayer Mr Andrew Cleghorn, 32, of Dickson
Place, Peebles.
He was overjoyed when the sheriff pronounced him not guilty of being
the owner of ''a dog of the type known as the pit bull terrier'' on
November 8 last year.
Slitz would have been destroyed automatically under the 1991 Dangerous
Dogs Act if Sheriff Thomson had accepted she was a pit bull terrier, as
she had not been registered as one.
The sheriff came to his conclusion after a five-day trial in which he
heard evidence from three vets -- two called by the prosecution, who
insisted that Slitz was a pit bull terrier, and one called by the
defence, who maintained that she is a Staffordshire cross.
Giving his verdict, the sheriff said the Act was most curious as,
''unlike all normal criminal procedures'', it put the onus on the
defence to prove its case.
The Act was also curious in that two of the normal presumptions
required in criminal cases were absent -- ''the presumption in favour of
life and the presumption of innocence''.
He said: ''The whole Act is designed to promote death, and it is clear
that there is a presumption of guilt.''
Sheriff Thomson also expressed regret that Slitz herself, impounded
when her owner was charged, was not produced in court.
However, referring to the vets' contributions as expert witnesses,
which included assessments of Slitz's skinfolds, tail, gait, teeth
alignment and bone measurements, he said he preferred that of the
defence vet.
He also recalled it was decided in an English case that the question
of a dog's ''character or disposition or temperament'' was a matter that
should not be ignored.
He said: ''Here there is no indication that this particular dog was in
any way aggressive.''
The dog has to remain in custody until depute procurator-fiscal Mr
John Napier decides whether to appeal.

COMPENSATION is to be paid out by Strathclyde region following
withering criticism by the Ombudsman of huge delays in processing
complaints against social workers.
The report by Local Government Ombudsman, Mr Frederick Marks, revealed
exclusively in The Herald, highlighted the tragic case of a child on the
at risk register who lost both her hands in a domestic fire.
Her father's complaint against the department's handling of her case
has still not been dealt with -- four years after the accident.
In three other cases which Mr Marks investigated, there were delays
ranging frm 150 days to 88 days.
The social work committee has agreed compensation of #1000 in respect
of the tragic case involving the child, and #200 with regard to each of
the other three cases.
It was emphasised the payments related only to the delays in dealing
with complaints, and not the complaints themselves.
Committee members also endorsed revised procedures aimed at ensuring
there was no repetition of such unacceptable delays.
But it is also urgently seeking clarification from the Scottish Office
on how to proceed where there is the possibility of legal action against
the council.
Its legal advisers have warned that in such cases the complaints
procedure might have to be suspended in order that the council's
position should not be prejudiced.
They also take the view that the legal requirement to respond to a
complaint within 28 days is unrealistic.

TWO police officers walked free from Arbroath Sheriff Court yesterday
after charges against them were dropped because of a legal blunder.
Police Constable Harry Anderson and his girlfriend Woman Police
Constable Shirley Bayne had proceedings against them thrown out by a
sheriff.
Ms Bayne, 28, of Spink Street, Arbroath, had faced a charge of
dangerous driving on a road near Arbroath on April 29 last year and was
accused, with Mr Anderson, also of Spink Street, of making offensive
gestures to an Asian motorist and his passengers while they were
off-duty.
It was alleged that Ms Bayne deliberately slowed her car to 15mph and
took up a position preventing a car driven by Shahid Ramzan from
overtaking.
Once he had overtaken, it was said she had deliberately driven towards
the offside, forcing him to drive on a verge.
Before the trial began, defence solicitor Mr Peter Watson argued that
it should not go ahead because the procurator-fiscal's office had
possession of the defences of both accused.
The court heard that complaints made by the accused against the
motorist and by the motorist against the accused in connection with the
alleged incident were merged by police and later sent to the fiscal's
office.
Mr Watson said the information from the two accused constables gave
the Crown an unfair advantage.
Fiscal Mrs Elizabeth Bott said it was an ordinary claim and
counter-claim situation.
But Sheriff Colin Harris, QC, said that the information gathered by
police from the complainers had not been kept ''sufficiently separate''.
He upheld the defence plea in bar of trial.

POLICE were ''annoyed'' yesterday at football star Eric Cantona's
''blatant disregard'' to help them in their inquiries after he struck a
spectator at a match at Crystal Palace two weeks ago.
Cantona and Manchester United team mate Paul Ince were due to return
to South Norwood police station in south London for questioning about
the incident.
Ince turned up, was arrested and interviewed and given police bail to
return at ''a later date''.
But the French player failed to turn up and is understood to be on
holiday in Antigua.
A Metropolitan police spokesman said: ''We have expressed our
annoyance to Cantona's solicitor as we believe this shows a blatant
disregard for police inquiries.''
Cantona plans to defend himself at an FA inquiry on February 24 into
his kung fu-style attack on a Crystal Palace fan.
Cantona's solicitor, Mr Maurice Watkins, denied he had failed to show.
''No appointment had been made for him to appear because he is on
holiday and the police were fully aware of this.''

THOUSANDS of mainly rural businesses are facing a large surcharge on
the price of their gas supplies, it was revealed yesterday.
Hotels, manufacturing companies, crofts, and others unable to use
mains gas are among those which will suffer temporary increases of up to
25%, adding hundreds of pounds to their overheads.
Calor Gas, Britain's biggest supplier of liquid petroleum gas, said
yesterday that an international shortage of propane, and a consequent
rise in the fuel's cost, had forced changes in its pricing structure.
From this week, all of Calor's commercial bulk customers will have to
pay an extra 3p a litre, or six pence a kilogramme of propane bought in
cylinders.
The company insisted yesterday that the surcharge was a temporary
measure, and said it would be removed as soon as possible.
Other commercial suppliers are believed to be implementing similar
steps, although industry observers have forecast that the European gas
market will return to more normal levels within two months.
In a separate move, Calor has added a permanent increase of 2.6% on to
the bills of tens of thousands of domestic bulk users of LPG, taking the
standard price to almost 20p a litre.
A company spokesman defended the domestic rise, saying the cost of
propane had gone up by only 10% in the past 10 years. The prices of
smaller butane cylinders are not affected by the changes.
However, a number of Calor's commercial customers in Scotland have
expressed unhappiness at the surcharge they face, pointing out that the
company's main rival, Macgas, has so far chosen to absorb the extra cost
of propane and not pass it on to users.
Mr Nick Ryan, of the Crinan Hotel in Argyll, said Calor enjoyed a
virtual monopoly in remote parts of the Highlands and islands, and
customers found it extremely difficult to transfer to another supplier.
''This is a stick-up,'' he said.
The co-owner of Airds Hotel at Port Appin, Mr Graeme Allen, said any
increase in the cost of gas would make it harder to keep the hotel open
all year round -- a policy which sustained a large number of jobs in the
local economy.
''We will be watching very carefully to make sure they bring the price
back down soon,'' he said.
Calor argued that many commercial users benefited from a discounted
price, and said rural businesses paid the same as their urban
counterparts, despite the increased cost of transporting the fuel to
remote areas.
Macgas yesterday declined to comment on the situation, although it is
understood that a number of Calor customers have asked the Glasgow-based
company for details of how they could transfer their supply.

RALLY driver Calum Munro was fined for careless driving at Inverness
Sheriff Court although he did not drive at more than 25mph. He had taken
his rally car on to the Inverness-Fort William road near the village of
Dores to try to fix a locked rear wheel. He drove partly on a verge to
protect the expensive tyre, but came on to the road at intervals to
avoid drain culverts. Two vehicles travelling behind had to brake
sharply to avoid his car, which was backed up by a support vehicle. A
defence agent said Munro did not leave first gear during the manoeuvre.
Sheriff James Fraser fined Munro, of Craigdarroch House Hotel, Foyers,
#150 and told him: ''The public road is not there for you to sort out
the problems of your specialised car.''

LOTHIAN'S director of education is to carry out an investigation into
child labour after complaints from an official of the shopworkers'
union, Usdaw, of ''sweat shop wages and conditions''. Mr Rab Knox, area
organiser, said some children delivering newspapers were carrying 52lb
in weight, double what postal workers were allowed to carry. Their
average wage was #1.80 an hour.

VOLUNTARY organisations in the social welfare field are to receive
#900,000 more in Government grants this year, a 16% increase. Lord
Fraser of Carmyllie said that the grants, totalling #7.2m, would enable
150 organisations and projects to develop their work at national and
local level. Organisations working with children and their families and
in areas such as community care, volunteering, and victim support would
receive more. The grants include #160,000 over two years to the Local
Government Support Unit to be run by the Scottish Council for Voluntary
Organisations. It will provide information and support to voluntary
bodies working with the new local authorities.

A MAN who gave evidence at his own trial last year again appeared at
Ayr Sheriff Court yesterday, denying a rare charge of perjury. Craig
Milne, 28, of Blythswood Square, Glasgow, previously appeared on January
13 and 14, 1993. He was found guilty of driving a hired car while
disqualified and without insurance. The trial continues.
It is the first time in 97 years, when an accused was first allowed to
give evidence at their own trial, that a person has been convicted but
later charged with perjury.

FOUR paratroopers who escaped prison sentences after crippling a
father-of-two were yesterday disciplined by their commanding officer.
After being summoned before Lieutenant Colonel Godfrey McFall, all
four were given formal warnings about their future conduct.
They all received ''regimental entries'' -- black marks in their
personal records which are likely to affect future promotion.
Lance Corporals Stuart Baillie, 26, and Justin Woodcock, 22, were
reduced to the rank of private.
Baillie, Woodcock, and Privates Craig Harris, 23, and James Collins,
21, had returned to the 1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, which is
serving in Belfast.
The four admitted unlawfully wounding Mr James McGuire, 33, outside an
Aldershot nightclub after going out to celebrate Baillie's promotion to
lance corporal last year.
Mr McGuire suffered two fractured arms, broken ribs, and head injuries
and spent 10 days in hospital. His injuries were so bad that he still
cannot pick up his children.
A furious row erupted after the men were ordered to do community
service and pay compensation to Mr McGuire when they appeared at
Winchester Crown Court on Tuesday for sentence.
Aldershot MP Julian Critchley said that neither the military
discipline nor the community service orders imposed by the courts was
proper punishment for the crime.
Mr Critchley, who took up the case with Defence Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind, said he believed they should all have served a spell behind
bars at the military jail at Colchester.
Probation chiefs firmly backed the judge's decision, calling the
sentences ''rigorous, constructive, and cost-effective''.

<HEADLINE>Nine years for rapist fascinated by vampires</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A RAPIST who left his schoolgirl victim so petrified that she still
suffers nightmares and refuses to sleep alone at night, was yesterday
jailed for nine years.
Malcolm Foster, who had been freed from prison just two days earlier,
attacked the 15-year-old as she walked through Mowbray Park in
Sunderland, Tyne and Wear.
He tore her clothes off and raped her, struck her on the head with a
wooden stake and strangled her. She lost consciousness and when she came
round, Foster was licking blood from a gaping cut above her eye.
Sixteen months later, she is still haunted by nightmare memories and
refuses to sleep alone.
The Crown Court in Newcastle upon Tyne was told Foster, 29, a homeless
drifter, had a macabre fascination for vampirism. Detectives who
arrested him found a copy of a novel which advocates drinking the blood
of young girls to stay looking youthful.
The novel was found amoung his possessions at his makeshift home in a
warehouse in the Hendon area of Sunderland.
Mr Justice Holland told him: ''Such was the level of violence on this
girl in the course of the attack, that she was not far away from death.
''The impact upon her beggars belief. I can only hope that, in time,
healing will take place aided by the counselling she is receiving.''
The judge added that a long jail sentence was needed to protect the
public.
At an earlier hearing, which was adjourned for reports, Foster
admitted rape and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in
October 1993.
Prosecuting, Mr Aidan Marron, QC, told the court that Foster battered
the girl and the injury to her eye later needed 14 stitches.
He said Foster led the girl from the park after the attack and she ran
sobbing uncontrollably to a nearby shop, her face, neck, and hair
drenched in blood.
Mr Marron said: ''She is still unable to sleep alone in her bedroom,
she is disturbed by panic attacks and frightening flashbacks.''
Defence counsel, Mr Franz Muller, QC, said Foster had been addicted to
glue sniffing since he was 13. Just two days before the attack, he was
released from jail with #126, which he spent on solvents.

<HEADLINE>MP and unions demand commitment to Ayrshire explosives plant's future Factory fears as 200 jobs go</HEADLINE>

FEARS were expressed yesterday for the long-term future of the Nobel's
Explosives Company plant in Ayrshire after it announced the loss of up
to 200 jobs.
The ICI subsidiary is to phase out the manufacture of initiating
systems (detonators) at the Ardeer site by the end of October as part of
a restructuring programme which will leave a workforce of about only
400.
Workers at the plant had faced a long wait for yesterday's news. The
jobs cut is the result of a review announced last August which was
initially intended to be completed in a few weeks.
Local MP Brian Donohoe said he had ''major fears'' about the future of
the plant and would be making new approaches to the company with
increased urgency. ''These job losses are a terrible blow to the local
economy, given the high levels of unemployment within this part of
Ayrshire.
''Along with my fellow Ayrshire MPs and local trade unions, I have
been pushing ICI to back up its commitment to the plant. It is
unfortunate that it has apparently chosen to ignore these
representations.''
Mr Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, added: ''It is essential that we
continue with the pressure on ICI to safeguard the jobs of the remaining
workers.''
''The announcement has come as a shock to those who are affected,''
said the TGWU's Mr Ian Gibb, shop stewards' convener. ''Some refused to
carry on working in their areas until they met senior executives.''
In some cases, because of the nature of the work, union officials felt
that it would not be totally safe for employees to continue while their
minds were not completely on the job. The company had not applied any
pressure over the temporary stoppage, he added.
''We are angry at the news because it is totally unnecessary. Lack of
investment is the prime reason for this body blow. Unemployment in this
area is already more than 17%.'' The unions had been demanding
investment for five years and would be stepping up their campaign.
He added: ''We believe political pressure in the USA led ICI to drop
its proposed investment plans for Ardeer in favour of its explosives
plant in Pennsylvania. That investment was to manufacture products such
as car safety air bag igniters for which there is a growing worldwide
demand.
''We aim to apply similar political pressure on ICI and make them take
seriously our demands for investment to reverse the trend of decline at
Ardeer.''
As well as being a manufacturing base, the Ardeer site has served as
the business headquarters for the Nobel's Explosives Company (NEC) which
has two smaller plants, near Wigan and in North Wales. But under the
restructuring plan, NEC's affairs were devolved to separate business
units and the position of NEC managing director was discontinued.
A statement issued by the company yesterday said there had been a
radical reduction in demand, particularly from the coal mining sector,
for the initiating systems manufactured at Ardeer. It added: ''Despite
attempts to find profitable alternative markets and rigorous cost
control, that operation has been in loss for several years.''
A small part of Ardeer's initiating systems operation will be
relocated to the Wigan plant, but the rest will cease altogether. The
Ayrshire site will continue to manufacture chemical and other products
for automotive and aerospace customers.

A YOUNG woman wept yesterday as she told of the last hours of her
boyfriend, who died after taking drugs at a rave in the Hanger 13
nightclub.
Miss Claire Prentice, 18, of Bellfield Road, Coalburn, told a fatal
accident inquiry in Ayr that she had been going out with Andrew Stoddart
for a month. He collapsed and died after attending the rave event on
August 20 last year.
The college student broke down several times while recalling the
events which began with a birthday celebration and ended in her
boyfriend's death in Ayr Hospital.
Miss Prentice was speaking on the third day of the inquiry before
Sheriff Neil Gow into the deaths of Mr Stoddart, 20, of Rigside,
Lanarkshire, and of Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, Ayrshire, and
Mr Andrew Dick, 19, from Glasgow, on May 1 last year. All three had
attended Hanger 13.
She told Mr James Kelman, procurator-fiscal depute, that she had
joined Mr Stoddart and a group of friends on a bus from Rigside and that
he had spoken of ''getting some when he got there''. Miss Prentice
agreed that he meant drugs, probably ecstasy.
She said that, 10 minutes after entering Hanger 13, Mr Stoddart went
away then returned to show her three tablets. Sheriff Gow: ''Did you
know what they were?'' Miss Prentice: ''Yes, I knew that they were
ecstasy.''
She said Andrew had paid #45 for the drugs and that to her knowledge
he took two tablets and had one left in his pocket. Miss Prentice added:
''He told me later he was not feeling well. He said he had very sore
legs. I went to get a steward and he took him outside and sat him on a
bench.''
Mr Stoddart was given water then he was lain down on the ground as
stewards tried to resuscitate him. An ambulance came and took him away.
''I told them that Andrew had taken ecstasy but was not sure how many.''
Mr Craig Ramage, 18, of Newtonhead Road, Rigside, said he had met Mr
Stoddart and the rest of the group at the Viewfield Tavern in the
village and travelled to Ayr. He had agreed to share an ecstasy tablet
with Mr Stoddart and they did this waiting in the queue to get in.
He told the inquiry that, once inside the club, Mr Stoddart returned
with the half tablet he owed him. ''Then I asked him to get me some E
and I gave him #60 and I received four tablets. I took another one but I
cannot remember taking any more. I had one left at the end of the
night.''
Mr Ramage said that, later that night, he heard ''a lassie screaming''
and saw his friends running to where Mr Stoddart was being dragged out
by stewards.
Mr Craig Forrest, 21, of Ayr Road, Rigside, said he had been told that
Mr Stoddart had taken an ecstasy tablet inside the club and that his
eyes looked glazed. ''He sat down beside me later and was drinking a can
of juice. He looked normal. Suddenly he was shaking, like a fit, a
convulsion. He was taken outside by a steward.''
Miss Jacqueline Loudon, 20, of Broomfield Street, Netherburn, told the
inquiry of seeing Mr Stoddart shaking and unable to stand as he was
helped out by stewards.
''They took him round the side and tried to give him water. The water
was just running out of his mouth after that. Then they laid him down
and gave him mouth-to-mouth. Then the ambulance came and took him
away,'' said Miss Loudon.
Mr Daniel Russell, 35, of Gillies Street, Troon, told the inquiry that
he was head steward and in charge of training.
He said he had been at the front door when colleagues brought a man he
later learned was Mr Stoddart from the hall because he appeared unwell.
''We walked him around and tried to cool him down,'' he added.
Another steward, Mr James Graham, 30, of Gillies Street, Troon, said
that, on August 20, he had been called to assist a young man and when he
got there his friends were cuddling him and saying all was well.
He added: ''I looked at him and his eyes were rolling in his head. I
picked him up and carried him to the door. He was sweating and seemed
dehydrated.
''We gave him water but he did not improve. Then Danny Russell tried
for a pulse but could not get one. Danny gave him mouth-to-mouth and I
gave him heart massage until the ambulance came.
''We finally learned from his girlfriend that he had taken ecstasy
tablets. She said he had a tablet in his pocket and I looked for it in
case it would help the ambulance men. There was nothing in his
pockets.''
Asked by Mr Jack Drummond, representing the Stoddart family, if he
felt 22 stewards was enough to control up to 1400 people at a rave, Mr
Graham said he thought it was.
The inquiry continues.

EXCLUSIVE
ANNUAL fees at Gleneagles Golf Club have soared by between 23% and
30%, leading to cries of foul play.
Increases at two other leading courses, St Andrews and Turnberry, are
either non-existent or small in comparison.
Mr Tom Younger, golf operations director at Gleneagles, denied the new
rates, on top of a 12% rise last year, are a ripoff. He said the charges
still provide ''exceptional value for money''.
Individual memberships are up from #1100 to #1350 (+23%); founder
memberships from #675 to #850 (+26%), and corporate memberships from
#3300 to #4300 (+30%).
Hotel residents -- the only other people allowed to play the King's,
Queen's and Monarch's courses -- will now pay #60 a round, a 20%
increase on last year's #50 charge.
Gleneagles Hotel, owned by Guinness, is determined to get a return on
spending #8m on golf developments over the past three years.
Mr Younger confirmed the increases had caused ''a reaction'' among the
four clubs at Gleneagles -- Glenearn, Dunwhinny, Dunochil, and
Dunbracken.
He added: ''Club secretaries and captains, on being given an
explanation for the increases, fully understand the position.''
However, members are ''up in arms'' over the new subscriptions,
according to sources. ''They do not believe they are justifiable against
current inflation rates,'' one said.
At St Andrews, the home of golf, where the five courses are open to
the public, local residents can buy a season ticket giving access to
them all for #88. That ticket will cost #90 from April.
People from outwith north-east Fife, who under an Act of Parliament
must pay three times the local rate, get the same deal for #264, rising
to #270 in April.
Visitors' fees for one round of golf in the forthcoming 1995-96 season
will be held at current rates, the eight trustees in the St Andrews
links management committee have ruled.
Charges range from #14 on New Strathtyrum to #18 on Eden and #25 for
the Jubilee or New Course, while the Old Course fee is #55.
The Royal and Ancient declined to declare its club subscriptions on
grounds of client confidentiality. Its members receive special rights of
access to the courses, regardless of visitors' bookings.
At Turnberry, where the new hotel owners have invested #28m in four
years, residents will pay #55 for a round on the Ailsa course, with an
option to play the Arran course on the same day -- an increase of #5 on
last year. A non-resident will be charged #90 for the same day.
Annual membership has increased by just under 5%, from #850 to #890.

DOZENS of councillors across Scotland are counting on a nice little
treble coming up this April after elections for the shadow unitary
authorities.
Unlike a wager with the local turf accountant, however, this one is a
municipal certainty.
It is already known that councillors elected to the new shadow unitary
authorities will be entitled to claim two allowances -- one for their
work on their existing council and a second for their work for the
shadow authority -- doubling up to around #10,000.
However, a privileged elite, members of both regional and district
councils, could go for the treble, possibly amounting to more than
#15,000 for the single ''shadow'' year.
This would involve payment for work on a regional council, a district
council, and a shadow authority covering their existing district council
area.
It is understaood there could be more than five treblers in
Strathclyde, 22 in the Highlands, and many more in the other regions.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''Certain councillors
would be entitled to claim for the three allowances. They will be
performing separate and distinct roles and will therefore be entitled to
claim the appropriate allowances.''
Glasgow councillor, Bailie John Young, honorary president of the
Association of Scottish Conservative Councillors, has already expressed
doubts as to how a double payment could be justified.
He said: ''We were astonished at the double payment but we're
absolutely amazed at the thought of a treble payment.''
However, Councillor Iain Drysdale, the Conservative leader on
Strathclyde region, said if the councillors were actually doing the
three jobs they were entitled to the allowances.
One of the Strathclyde councillors who could land the treble is Mr
William Petrie, who is also on Dumbarton District Council.
He declared: ''If we're doing three jobs then we're entitled to the
allowances for three jobs.

THE privatisation of ScotRail is going ''seriously wrong'' as a result
of growing delays in the franchising process. Senior railway officials
have warned that doubts are growing over the sale of what was once the
Government's favourite franchise.
Under the Government's original timetable, ScotRail was supposed to
have passed into private hands in early 1994. The date has now been put
back until early 1996 and some within the railways are privately
suggesting it will not happen.
The news came as startled MPs at Westminster were told last night that
British Rail will have only #100m for capital investment in the next
finiancial year compared with #260m at present -- and #70m of the #100m
has been pre-committed.
Despite public assurances about the ScotRail privatisation process
being on course, Ministers are said to be concerned about the
unpopularity of recent decisions by franchising director Roger Salmon,
notably to axe Motorail and some sleeper services.
Sources in London and Scotland have told The Herald that Transport
Ministers and Mr Salmon were struggling with complications which had
thrown the ScotRail sell-off timetable into disarray.
One source in London said: ''This sale is going seriously wrong. It
has been hit by all sorts of complications which no-one expected and now
people are talking privately about it not happening at all.''
The biggest problem concerns Strathclyde Passenger Transport
Executive, which is part of the ScotRail franchise. It has so far
refused to give its approval to the terms on which the franchise will be
awarded.
At a private meeting with franchising officials on Tuesday,
Strathclyde representatives were told their objections threatened ''the
saleability of ScotRail''.
Mr Charles Gordon, convener of Strathclyde's transport committee, who
attended the meeting, said: ''The pace of privatisation is unsustainable
and that is the view of people behind the scenes. The sale of ScotRail
is grinding to a halt due to its own lack of internal logic.''
A senior BR source said last night: ''Strathclyde is proving to be a
huge headache for the franchising director. The fact that half of
ScotRail's business comes from the SPTE means it is hugely important to
its success. They have to take Strathclyde with them, and Strathclyde is
sticking to its guns.''
Strathclyde is refusing to compromise on pressures from the Government
to accept that timetable and quality requirements should be flexible.
''We have the best, most reliable suburban network in the country. We
achieve that by strict control of fares and total control of timetables.
That may cut the commercial flexibility of the franchise but it is
non-negotiable,'' said Mr Gordon.
In the early stages of privatisation, ScotRail was promoted by the
Government as one of the most attractive franchises because it is
geographically self-contained and has a clear corporate identity.
One source said delays were building up because ScotRail had not yet
been told by Mr Salmon what its minimum service requirements would be.
These are the key figures which will define timetables and on which
most of the franchise's financial calculations will be based.
Labour industry spokesman Brian Wilson said last night: ''I'm sure
they are in very deep trouble with ScotRail privatisation. It was
supposed to have happened last autumn but they are still waiting, while
the SPTE issue is no closer to being resolved.
''If the SPTE, which carries two-thirds of ScotRail's passengers
doesn't know where its money will come from in 15 months' time, how can
it sign up for anything? The other problem is that money is being taken
out of the system at a time when they are trying to get it into a fit
state for privatisation.''
BR's financial problems came to light as the Transport Select
Committee questioned BR chairman Sir Bob Reid and other executives last
night.
One Labour member of the committee described the news as
''flabbergasting''.
Before the disclosure, Sir Bob had restated his concerns about
investment levels in the railway system and warned the committee that
productivity could no longer be expected to offer big savings.
He added: ''You cannot expect to go on squeezing the lemon.''
Sir Bob pointed out that investment in the railway system was #665m
last year and #615m this year, compared with more than #1bn in previous
years.
''To keep the railway in a good steady state, we need to be spending
in the region of #900m to #1bn a year,'' he said.

MORE than 40% of Conservative voters in Scotland want a Parliament
established North of the Border, in spite of the Prime Minister's
dramatic raising of the stakes in the constitutional debate.
Mr John Major's attempt to polarise opinion on the Union does show
some signs of success, with those opting for the status quo climbing
back to 20% and support for both independence and devolution slipping
back slightly from 1993 levels. However, the majority of Scots demanding
constitutional change continues to run at its level for the last decade
of almost four in five.
Although the figure for those who would vote for immediate
independence is now 29%, down from a 1991 peak of 35%, the System Three
poll for The Herald includes evidence that Mr Major's intervention may
have backfired.
Asked to respond to his claim that devolution would lead to the
break-up of the UK, 47% gave a positive response to the idea of England,
Scotland and Wales each becoming independent countries, governed
separately, in contrast to 35% who were hostile to the concept.
This apparent long-term support for independence, which reached 50%
among Labour voters, was seized on by the SNP leader, Mr Alex Salmond,
who called the figures ''new and sensational''.
He said: ''John Major has tried to scare Scots with suggestions about
a slippery slope to independence. The answer to this question shows that
Scots are actually quite anxious to clamber onto that slope.
''Many Scots are firmly behind the SNP's policy of Independence in
Europe, and for many others who are not yet SNP voters, devolution is
only a process, not a final event. They want to reach the same
independence goal.''
The poll had plus and minus points for all sides in the debate,
revealing that, unprompted, the constitutional issue came well down
people's order of priorities, behind unemployment, the National Health
Service and education.
While this could be grasped at by Labour, the downside for them and
their Liberal Democrat partners in the Scottish Constitutional
Convention was that the prospect of tax-raising powers for a devolved
Scottish Parliament scared off 10% of those who would otherwise have
supported the plan, cutting support for home rule from 47% to 37% and
boosting support for no change from 20% to 30%.
The difference between our ''what would you vote for now'' question
and the result when people are asked about their views on a longer-term
change allowed all sides to take something from the poll.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, called the result
''a devastating blow for the Tories, a disappointment for the
Nationalists and a massive boost for Labour''.
Pointing out that 47% of Scots favoured the current plan for a
Scottish Parliament, and that almost a third of Tories were revealed as
devolution supporters, he said the poll proved that Scots wanted more
control without being ''wrenched out of the UK''.
He said the fact that other issues, such as unemployment and health,
featured strongly was evidence that Labour had its priorities right.
The Conservatives also jumped on this point, with Scottish party
chairman Sir Michael Hirst saying: ''Few people regard the
constitutional question as the most important issue facing them.''
Sir Michael claimed the split between independence and devolution
showed no scheme commanded a real majority. ''It is one thing to be in
favour of some romantic ideal of self-determination, but quite another
when the harsh practical implications are taken into consideration.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, pointed to the
consistency of support for self-determination over the years and said
his party was the only one to match that consistency. It was time for
all politicians to take heed of the simple message that Scots wanted
change and most favoured change within the UK.
''It is time for the Conservatives to take their head out of the sand.
If 41% of their own supporters now want reform, surely they must be able
to see that a Scottish Parliament really is required,'' he said.
* The figure suggesting that 47% of Scots are in favour of the
long-term break up of the UK, with 35% against, contrasts with the
English view that only 25% would favour the break-up and 44% would
oppose it. This is revealed in a Herald/System Three poll of attitudes
South of the Border which will be published tomorrow.
The poll was conducted among 1016 voters in their homes in 39
constituencies across Scotland between January 26 and 31, statistically
weighted to ensure the sample was representative of the population.

THE Cabinet is today expected to approve pay awards of 2% to 3% for
1.4 million public-sector workers, with the proviso that rises will
generally have to be funded out of efficiency savings.
The awards cover teachers, nurses, midwives, health visitors, doctors,
dentists, the Armed Forces, and senior public servants such as judges
and Whitehall mandarins.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is determined that there will be no easing
of the relentless pressure on the wage bill of public servants.
He has made it clear he expects the rises to be funded through a
ruthless assault on waste and unnecessary bureaucracy.
His tight-fisted approach is certain to provoke a fresh political row.
Tory back benchers, especially those in marginal seats, will join the
clamour from the Opposition, trade unions, and public-sector bodies to
fund in full the pay rises recommended by the various review bodies.
Most controversial is the teachers' pay award, which is expected to be
between 2.5% and 3%. Local authorities fear there will be no extra cash
from Whitehall to fund it.
The policy of restricting public sector pay is likely to be tested to
breaking point this year by a combination of rising inflation, tighter
market conditions, and greatly reduced scope for further efficiency
measures, according to a study by Incomes Data Services, published to
coincide with today's announcement.
IDS says that, during last year's public sector pay bill freeze, most
deals more or less matched the unexpectedly low rate of inflation but
that this will be much harder this year.
Other pressures include Mr Clarke's largely unnoticed one-year
extension of his public sector pay bill freeze to March 1998, which was
buried in his recent Budget statement, the continuing trend towards
decentralisation of wage bargaining, and Government insistence on the
extension of profit-related pay.
Increasingly, the Government's policy will mean lost jobs or reduced
services, or both, as a means of funding pay rises but IDS suggests that
the Government will come under increasing pressure to concede bigger pay
rises than can be paid for through such cuts.
IDS maintains there were points when last year's pay freeze policy of
funding wage rises from savings looked extremely fragile and that it
could be argued the 8.7% settlement of the Railtrack signal workers'
dispute actually breached the policy, as did the 4.7% MPs' rise and the
3% award to the police.
Although today's five pay review body reports are expected to
recommend increases of between 2.5% and 3%, the Chancellor has already
ruled out any additional state funding and eductional authorities are
warning of short-time working and therefore short-time learning.
Mr Clarke was Education Secretary when the teachers' pay review body
first reported in 1992. At that time, he declared himself delighted that
it had recommended a substantial increase which the Government ''had no
hesitation in implementing in full''. Giving teachers review body status
was ''an essential step in restoring the status of the teaching
profession'', he claimed at the time.
In recent years, the pay review bodies have awarded 9% to 12% in 1991
(when increases were staged except for the Armed Forces), 5.8% to 7.8%
in 1992, 1.5% (strict pay policy limit) in 1993, and 2.7% to 3% (pay
bill ''freeze'') last year.
IDS also reports that the number of workers covered by profit-related
pay schemes last year reached almost 1.9 million, about one in eight of
the workforce and more than four times the number involved since tax
relief was doubled in 1991.
Such ''tax-free pay schemes'' distort earnings figures by boosting the
net pay of employees by an average of 7% at no extra cost to employers.

WASHINGTON: Lady Thatcher was among some 900 admirers of former US
president Ronald Reagan yesterday and praised him as a ''giant'' of his
era at a gala party for his 84th birthday.
The Republican elder statesman and his wife Nancy were not at the
Washington party, which was televised live into their California home.
Mr Reagan revealed last November he suffers from Alzheimer's disease.
Lady Thatcher told the crowd: ''Like Churchill, you always understood
the big issues and you never faltered in your decisions. Ron's name will
join the roll eventually of the giants of our time.''--Reuter.
