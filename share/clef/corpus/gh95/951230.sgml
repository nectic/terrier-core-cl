THE PROSPECT BEFORE HER: A History of Women in Western Europe. Volume One, 1500
- 1800
Olwen Hufton
HarperCollins, #25
IN Northanger Abbey which Jane Austen had just begun at the close of the
eighteenth century, and of the period covered by this book, Catherine Morland
remarks to Mr Tilney that she reads history a little as a duty but it tells her
nothing that does not either vex or weary her. She explains: ``The quarrels of
popes and kings, with wars and pestilences in every page; the men all so good
for nothing, and hardly any women at all, it is very tiresome; and yet I often
think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it must be
invention.''
It is a wonderfully apt and well-chosen quotation with which Olwen Hufton opens
her remarkable book telling a different sort of history. It is a bold choice,
too, for it sets the author the considerable target of ensuring the story she
has to tell is neither vexing, nor wearying, nor tiresome, nor dull and yet at
the same time fulfils the obligations of a serious historian dealing with a
huge subject over an immensely lengthy span of years during which there was
inevitably much change. Even for an immensely experienced prize-winning
historian, who was able, as she explains, to draw upon the intellectual baggage
of her lifetime's work in comparative European social history, the project was
of daunting proportions.
She has succeeded magnificently. This is no dull history book. There is nothing
dry or dusty about the narrative, despite the fact that it is a work of
scholarship intended as much for the historian in the library as for the
``lay'' reader, the working woman on the bus. It is interesting and
informative, filled with delicious nuggets of social history and it is
readable. The last 150 pages are notes and bibliography which I left to the
history students, but despite the somewhat fearsome size of the book - it is
such that you could probably kill a man with a well-aimed throw - it is an easy
read.
While the cautious man should rightly steer clear of any aggrieved women of his
acquaintance who are engaged in reading this book - at least until it is in
paperback - he should not fear opening it himself. It is a considerable work of
obvious feminist importance, but another of the author's significant
achievements is that it does not read like a work of vengeance on behalf of the
neglected women of history; it is not in any sense a one-sided dogmatic tract.
It is the story of women and men during this period, explaining their lives as
one affected the other in different countries and social conditions.
It is an economic and social analysis of the role of women in the
pre-industrial societies of western Europe. She concentrates mostly on France
and Britain, but there is much incidental intelligence from elsewhere woven
into the historical tapestry. It is set in the context of the questions about
women that are relevant to the history of the period. To paraphrase the author:
What did women do? How did change affect their lives and those of their
families? What were the consequences of the Reformation and its attendant
guilts on everyone's sex lives? What do we really know about motherhood? Who
acquired literacy and what did they do with it? Who rebelled and why? Who lived
and who died?
The first several chapters take the lives of girls and women through the
various stages of womanhood, and this is followed by an examination of the
unusual: witches and whores and writers and women in the French Revolution. It
is all put in the perspective of the traditional society and the extent of
change in the period. The bad news is, or was, that while some were beginning
to question the continuing dependence of women at every level, there was really
no agenda for improving their lot even by the end of her 300 years.
She pictures young girls seeking employment in order to establish the dowry and
thus the husband; their marriage; their motherhood and their widowhood. None of
it makes for very cheery reading - apart from the constant personal reminder of
the extent to which one might be very grateful to be living now and not then.
Their lives, at whatever social strata, appear to constitute a catalogue of
misery ranging from, at worst, a struggle to survive at all to a position
which, at best, seems always to have been lacking in dignity. It is,
apparently, a tenet of much feminist analysis since the 1960s that the progress
of women's lives has throughout history represented a ``descent from paradise''
to the horrors of the twentieth century. Olwen Hufton would seem to have her
doubts about this which, on the basis of her own work, I would wholly share.
That doesn't mean, though, that I wasn't riveted by much of the social detail
she records: about the dangers and difficulties of survival, for example. In
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, 25 women in every thousand in Britain
and 40 per thousand in Paris died in childbirth (compared to 0.12 per thousand
today). The babies were carried off at an even greater rate, and if they made
it to weaning they were lucky if they didn't then fall victim to summer
diarrhoea caused by the filthy conditions in which everyone lived. It was only
if they got to the age of five that they were reckoned to have a good chance on
living to a middle-age, motherhood notwithstanding.
They all had lice and worms and never washed and they thought that cradle cap
was meant to protect the cranium and it wasn't picked off (after a gentle
rubbing with butter) until the infant was several years old. It is all
absolutely disgusting and utterly compelling to read about.
It is the best sort of history book because it is filled with the trivial
detail which illuminates. The author tells the tale of a classic case of a
witch trial in Scotland in the late seventeeth century brought against one
Janet MacMurdoch, a sub-tenant of the laird of Broughtone, who spent years
causing people's husbands and cattle and children to suffer and die for
crossing her.
``Poverty,'' writes Olwen Hufton, ``perhaps also bred its own kind of defiance
- known in Scotland as `smeddum', the propensity to answer back, the refusal of
deference.'' She did not defend herself when she was brought to trial as an old
woman. She was aggressive and defiant - and convicted (although we can only
assume her fate). Even smeddum didn't get you far 400 years ago.

IN the midst of the dark days of winter, when storms blow and rain lashes the
windows, it's something to look forward to - that verdant renewal of life that
is the spring. Lighter days, the first leaves on the trees, and the birdsong;
above all, the birdsong.
There are few who would disagree that without it life would be intolerable. So
what of the unthinkable prospect of a silent spring? Ridiculous, you might say;
but you'd be wrong. Far-fetched as it may seem, ornithologists believe changes
in farming practices in the last few decades make the silent spring a real
possibility.
Studies have shown a dramatic drop in the populations of some of Britain's
best-loved birds, and unless measures are taken to improve the situation, they
will decline even further.
Take Shelley's blithe spirit, the skylark, for example. ``The situation is
becoming desperate with some three million fewer breeding skylarks singing in
the British countryside,'' says Dr Jeremy Greenwood, director of the British
Trust for Ornithology.
Following the production of a report highlighting the problem, the trust has
launched an appeal to help pay for research into the specific reasons for the
decline in farmland bird populations, and to find ways of boosting numbers.
The trust is not the only body to have shown concern. The Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds reports skylark numbers have diminished by more than 50% on
farmland over the past 20 years. In Scotland, as well as other parts of the UK,
it is joined by the tree sparrow, grey partridge, lapwing, and reed bunting,
among others.
``We view the situation regarding farmland birds as very alarming, and across
the society's work, the plight of farmland birds is one of our biggest
priorities,'' says Steve Sankey, head of policy and advice at the RSPB's
Edinburgh headquarters. ``It's easy to recognise the problems, it's much less
easy to resolve them.''
Changes in farming methods brought about by the Common Agricultural Policy are
to blame. In order to thrive, birds need a food source and they need a breeding
habitat. The CAP has encouraged farm units to merge and become bigger, and
rewarded farmers for intensifying production and bringing non-productive land
into use.
In the process, farmland birds have lost what they need to survive. Pests have
no place on high-yield farms, so pesticides have been employed to prevent them
attacking crops. Consequently, insects and invertebrates - vital sources of
food for insect eaters such as the skylark - have been drastically reduced.
Farmland weeds, whose seeds are another food source for birds, have been
suppressed with herbicides. Their food in short supply, birds have had to cope
with fewer hedgerows and rough ground cover for breeding, reducing their
chances of survival still further.
Berwickshire, the Lothians, and parts of Aberdeenshire are the worst affected
areas in Scotland, but even in the less intensively farmed areas, says Sankey,
there is still an increased use of chemicals and mechanisation.
Another group of birds threatened is farmland waders, affected by the increased
drainage of wet areas to bring them into production. The lapwing, already
mentioned, together with oystercatchers, snipe, curlew, and redshank come into
this category.
``None of us in the RSPB blames the farmers,'' stresses Sankey, ``because we
recognise that it's hard making a living, particularly in the remoter areas of
the country. It's the system that's at fault, and it's the system we need to
change.''
This may sound like a Marxist analysis of the political economy, but it has
been shown that careful management and a sympathetic approach to production
which takes into account environmental requirements, can make a difference.
Biodiversity is the current conversational buzzword for it, and in the case of
one bird in particular, it has proved crucial to its survival on a worldwide
scale.
The secretive corncrake, with its grating, vocal call, is a rare and threatened
species which requires very specific conditions for breeding. Once widespread
and common, it has undergone a dramatic and continuing decline. Now nearly all
the remaining corncrakes in Britain are confined to the Outer Hebrides and the
Argyll islands.
Drastic action was needed to deal with the problem and three years ago the
RSPB, in conjunction with Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Crofters'
Union, initiated a scheme to save the bird.
``We paid crofters to delay the cutting of their hay until the beginning of
August and we paid them a little more money to cut their corn in a particular
way,'' explains Sankey. Corncrakes like the cover of long grass and crops, and
other tall plants, where their eggs are laid. By August, adults and young
migrate to Africa for the winter, and the initiative was designed to safeguard
breeding and rearing. Numbers have shown a modest increase in the past two
years.
``What's good for corncrakes is also good for many other species,'' says
Sankey. ``We know exactly what corncrakes need because of all the research we
have done, but we have so far failed to get the Scottish Office to include that
in an agri-environment programme.''
Over the past three years #10.5m in the Scottish Office budget earmarked for
environmentally sensitive areas, which could have been paid to farmers and
crofters to help wildlife, has returned to Treasury coffers, claims the RSPB.
The Government is in the process of publishing a biodiversity plan and rural
White Paper, both of which Sankey hopes will help farmland birds.
If the lilting, liquid sound of Shelley's skylark is to be part of British
countryside, and the silent spring is not to become a reality, the warning
signs must be heeded; the message not dismissed as exaggerated, and the people
bringing it not labelled as alarmist cranks.

Michael Fry, in his latest missive, recounts a frosty festive reception for the
Prince and his followers.
GLASGOW, December 30 - After nearly a week in this Presbyterian stronghold,
Prince Charles Edward Stuart is preparing with relief to march on to the north.
He has had a frosty reception from Glaswegians, and a response in kind from the
Jacobites has made the festive season miserable for both sides.
The only revelry took place before the prince's arrival, a fortnight ago, when
false reports that the Duke of Cumberland had defeated him near Lancaster
brought the people on to the streets to celebrate. As soon as the Jacobites'
advance guard entered the undefended city late on Christmas Day, Glasgow left
no doubt that they were unwelcome.
Reports had arrived of outrages as they advanced down the River Clyde. They
pillaged and burned Lesmahagow, in revenge for the villagers' action two months
ago, when they happened to capture a Highland chieftain, Donald Macdonald of
Kinlochmoidart, and turned him in to the royal authorities. In Hamilton,
officers were accused of losing control as their men got drunk, looted, and
threatened civilians.
Scouts were sent on to Glasgow while Charles enjoyed a short break at Hamilton
Palace, seat of the absent Duke of Hamilton. The prince went hunting in the
park, and shot a brace each of pheasant, woodcock, and hare, as well as a young
buck. For Christmas, he dined in public at Chatelherault off a turkey which
cost three shillings.
The next day, a big crowd of Glaswegians turned out to watch his arrival, but
nobody cheered and the men all kept their hats jammed on their heads. The only
commotion came as he rode up the Saltmarket when, according to unconfirmed
reports, someone aimed a pistol at him. After parading along the main streets,
the Jacobites marshalled at the Cross, where King James VIII was proclaimed
with Prince Charles as his Regent. Onlookers again remained silent.
Some clansmen have been billeted, without incident, on private homes. The rest
are encamped round the half-built St Andrew's church, beside the Molendinar
Burn in between London Road and Glasgow Green, where they are drilled daily.
During one review the prince was heard to remark that this was a fine town but
he found he had no friends here.
He is staying at Shawfield Mansion, on Trongate at the head of Stockwell
Street. The citizens are free to enter twice a day to watch him dine with his
staff, though few do so. He cannot quite believe they are so impervious to his
charm, and walks the streets in his elegant French suits. Still, when he held a
ball, the Glaswegian ladies refused to attend.
The reason may lie in the fact that Charles has hit their husbands where it
hurts, in the pocket. While occupying Edinburgh during the autumn, he sent an
armed detachment to collect taxes from Glasgow. The city gave him only #5000 of
the #15,000 asked for. Now, with his soldiers ragged and often barefoot after
the invasion of England, the prince has ordered the town council to hand over
6000 coats, waistcoats, blue bonnets, and pairs of shoes and stockings, with
12,000 linen shirts.
The Lord Provost, George Murdoch, has been fined #500 for the previous
unfriendly act of raising two battalions to fight the Jacobites. The total cost
to the city will be #10,000, and may exhaust the Common Good Fund. Similar
punishment, on a lesser scale, has been meted out to Paisley.
The open hostility so angered some chieftains that they urged Charles to sack
and burn the city. Luckily another of them, Donald Cameron of Lochiel, has
strong links with it. His brother, John Cameron of Fassifern, is a merchant and
burgess of Glasgow. His aunt, Mrs John Campbell, lives at Shawfield Mansion and
is Charles's unwilling hostess. Lochiel persuaded him to stick to his policy of
avoiding needless suffering to civilians.
The West of Scotland has been unable to mount any organised resistance. But
since the Jacobites left and crossed the Border two months ago, the general
situation in the country has changed in the British Government's favour. Its
troops have retaken Inverness. The Royal Navy is setting up a blockade in such
depth as to make it impossible for the prince to get the French supplies he
needs to tighten his grip on Scotland.
All this has yet to be taken into account in Jacobite strategy. Since the
retreat from Derby, the prince's first aim has been to make contact with the
fresh troops recruited while he is away in England. In the North-east, Lord
Lewis Gordon has raised two regiments which, in a skirmish at Inverurie, have
just repulsed units sent to attack them by Loudoun. They can now combine with
the French force under Lord John Drummond which landed a month ago at Montrose,
and with reinforcements of Frasers, Mackintoshes, and Mackenzies.
After a planned rendezvous with Charles at Perth, they could bring total
Jacobite strength up to 7000. He will then have several options. One would be
to attack Stirling Castle, still held for the Government, and secure the lines
of supply from the Highlands. Another would be to attempt the recapture of
Edinburgh. The prince himself has not abandoned the scheme of turning about to
invade England again.
However, the scheme suffered a setback today with the surrender to Cumberland
of the Jacobite garrison left behind in Carlisle. Mostly Englishmen recruited
in Lancashire, they had the job of keeping open the route to the south. As the
duke approached, they did their best to strengthen the town's crumbling
defences with earthworks and sandbags. But he brought up heavy cannon, and
after three days of bombardment further resistance was useless.
Cumberland would grant the soldiers no terms, only ``that they should not be
put to the sword, but reserved for the King's pleasure''. He added in a message
to London that ``they have no sort of claim to the King's mercy and I sincerely
hope they will meet with none''.

Ping!, The Happy Gang (Happy Gang)
As the Singing Kettle go more and more showbiz, blythely annexing the panto
tradition for the under-eights down at the SECC in Glasgow, the new pretenders
move smartly into early SK territory with their second cassette, featuring
versions of the likes of Aitken Drum and The Wee Kirkcudbright Centipede.
Modern keyboard instruments rather than the traditional instruments that
distinguished the Kettle's earliest (and best work), but still just the thing
for those long car journeys this time of the year necessitates.Enter the
Hardbag, various (A&amp;M)
Just what your Uncle Adam and his flatmate Steve would like to have found in
their stocking. This 2-CD set is the perfect gift for foxy chaps who like
nothing better of an evening than waxing their chests, piercing their nipples
and then bouncing around to some cheesecore Nu-NRG music: high-speed handbag
music for high-speed he-man hedonists.
Nowhere is the hardbag philosophy better summed up than on Fee Fi Fo Fum by the
Candy Girls, an urgent demand for sexual congress with a large man of
Afro-Caribbean lineage.
Other highlights? Son Of A Gun by JX; Mrs Wood's Joanna, and Fluke's Bullet.
Listen to Enter The Hardbag and know that God made you to go for it, Adam and
Steve!
Rockabilly Filly, Rosie Flores (Hightone)
Neat twang'n'torch inspired by the Blessed St Patsy of Cline as well as a
host of primal rockabilly legends, including Johnny Burnette, whose son, Rocky,
turns up as one of Ms Flores guests. Super covers - Lefty Frizzell's Stranger,
Cliff Gallup's Bop Street, Butch Hancock's Boxcars, Crazy Mixed Emotions by
Russell Scott - and some corking originals. Yup, yup, yes indeedy; accompany
Rosie to her Poor Girl's Town for some good rockin' tonight.
A Sense of Direction, various (BGP)
``The in sound from way out: 12 positive jazz gems from the left side of jazz
culture'' it says on the cover, telling you most of what you need to know about
this collection's tastefully-swinging cool-bop delights, recorded between 1961
and 1987.
Vibe up with Walt Dickerson, providing a helpful Sense Of Direction. Abbey
Lincoln offers sinuous scat philosophies on Long As You're Living. Stanley
Cowell's I'm Trying To Find A Way is a swaying slice of chamber-orchestral
salsa. Soul legends Mel and Tim offer the best advice of all: Keep The Faith.
Tony McManus, Tony McManus (Greentrax)
McManus is one of the most exciting talents to have emerged on the Scottish
folk scene for years. An acoustic guitarist with a harpist's breadth of vision,
a piper's grace note-dotted phrasing and a twinkling-eyed wit (check his
version of Louis Armstrong's Wonderful World), he renders his occasional
accompanists almost superfluous on this remarkable debut. His slow airs are
clear and poignant and his reels are a spiky tribute to the benefits of being
born with 18 fingers on each hand.
Tone Poems II, David Grisman &amp; Martin Taylor (Acoustic Disc)
Anyone predicting back in January that one of my favourite tracks of 1995
would be a version of Swanee played with the last dance at a snail's soiree in
mind, would have had their temperature taken.
But here we are: track one of an intimate and reverent yet reinvigorating
breeze through the well-worn (Anything Goes, Unforgettable et al) and a few
newer choons, all beautifully played on a variety of vintage guitars and
mandolin family members which the accompanying booklet illustrates in life
savings-threatening detail.
Valpariaso, Rita Connolly (Tara)
The second album from the woman who gave cool, clear voice to Shaun Davey's
brilliant folk-rock opera Granuaille and Relief of Derry Symphony follows a
similar formula to the first: majestic singing, sumptuous accompaniments.
Connolly sails dangerously close to tweeness at times but her ability to
convince on songs as diverse as Irving Berlin's vaudevillian Shakin' the Blues
Away and Mike Nesmith's enigmatic Rio plus her commanding way with a narrative
swing the balance in her favour.A New Way of Listening - Book Competition

GOOD jazz news for the New Year came this week from the United States where
veteran alto saxophonist Benny Carter has announced he is ready to visit
Glasgow to front an all-star group.
Talks have begun to have Carter - who will be 89 this coming year - headline
the Glasgow Jazz Festival in July. It will be the tenth year of the Festival
and Carter featured heavily at the launch as composer in residence and
instrumentalist.
I still remember the altoist fronting a big band which included trumpeter Tommy
McQuater who had worked with the American fifty years before when Carter had
first come to Britain as staff arranger for Henry Hall's BBC Dance Orchestra.
This time round, Carter will be teamed with younger musicians, some of whom he
will hand pick. One has already been chosen, cornettist Warren Vache, who was
in Glasgow a few weeks back. Vache recently recorded an album of Carter songs
with the saxophonist which is set for release in February.
Vache says: ``It was a great experience. The idea was to get a whole gang of
singers to record some of Benny's numbers, some old favourites and some which
were unpublished until now.''
On this latest CD, entitled The Benny Carter Songbook, the singers involved
include Peggy Lee, Carmen Bradford, Ruth Brown, enjoying a New York revival
right now at Rainbow and Stars, Shirley Horn, Jon Hendricks, Bobby Shot and the
former count Basie vocal star Joe Williams.
Carter's career has been unlike that of any other major musician of his
generation. There have been few instances of the man being forced to scuffle
for a living though that might just have happened in his earlier days with the
Fletcher Henderson Orchestra.
He had an enormous influence on the British music scene during his stint with
the BBC, even though that was interrupted every few months because of work
permit restrictions. Still, at his creative peak, Carter was providing six new
arrangements a week for Henry Hall.
His playing too, was echoed by every Palais band altoist in the land. For long
enough these bad imitations which you could hear all around Scotland, and
England, made me chary of Carter's elegant, studied playing.
Eventually, however, I listened and I learned the breadth of the man's talents.
I doubt if, Louis Armstrong apart, any other black musician has been more
respected by his peers.
I can remember one time when the late Red Allen told me of Carter revisiting
his old Harlem haunts and how the musicians paid homage to him. Said Allen:``It
was like royalty visiting, all these guys who used to play with Benny in the
old days were there just wantin' to shake his hand. You see, Benny made it more
than any of us did.''
Allen was not only talking of Carter's superb musicianship, he was also talking
about the way the urbane and sophisticated saxophonist had broken down the
racial prejudices which long existed in the studios.
Carter wrote the sound track music for the film Stormy Weather in l943 and
followed up with other major Hollywood film successes and TV show themes. He
was the first black musician to break into that market and for many years he
hung up his horn to concentrate mainly on writing, though his Further
Definitions' reunion album with Coleman Hawkins was a notable return to the
recording scene.
Since he stopped writing movie scores he has returned to playing as often as he
can. Eighteen months ago I saw him at the Blue Note in New York in front of an
SRO audience and he played with an effortless lyricism. He is still doing it
and hopefully he will be demonstrating his mastery one more in Glasgow. It's a
nice thought to have around at Hogmanay!

MARRIAGE
Gloria Nagy
Little Brown, #16.99
MICKEY and Annie Wilder met, both aged six, when her family moved into the
converted brownstone on MacDougal Street, Greenwich Village, where his family
lived. They shared childhood and adolescence and married when Annie's mother
died. A year later their first child was born, ``and Annie moved aside and let
Mickey pass through. Mickey had the aura of success about him. He had
presence''.
Annie's move allowed Mickey to become a moderately successful actor, while she
did a little journalism.
Other couples found them special because of their endurance. ``Through the
seventies and eighties, when relationships were crashing like cheap pottery at
a Greek wedding - human beings smashing and breaking apart; infecting one
another with terrifying diseases; betraying, lying, incesting, child abusing,
deserting one another as if an epidemic of antihumanity had consumed the planet
- they endured. They were the envy of everyone.''
The Wilders transplanted to California when Mickey was chosen to star in a hit
television series. Especially in the spiritual home of active consumerism, such
a couple make dull fiction, so in their 45th year each has an affair and their
marriage looks like coming apart. The rifts remain, revealing sacrifices and
resentments each had kept hidden for the sake of their life together. Will they
make up, separate, stay together for the sake of the kids or make sufficiently
meaningful sacrifices for the sake of their relationship, if not each other?
Gloria Nagy has an irritating style. She is sloppily informative, layering the
narrative with nuggets of dross, so that she appears to be dispensing
information, but in fact is either telling nothing or is relating the sort of
detail one could either guess or manage perfectly well without.
When she does tell us something, it is almost immediately discounted or
contradicted. ``Having always been together, they could not even imagine being
apart,'' she says early on. Yet most of the novel is spent actively discussing,
contemplating, analysing and at one point even embarking on this proposition.
Apart from the affairs, we do not know how or why this happens. Too much has to
be taken at face value and while these impressions are generally disguised by
the mellifluous pace, there are occasions when cracks appear in more than the
marriage. Gloria Nagy assumes we will take her word for it. She tells what is
going on, and makes empirical statements with little or no evidence to support
them.
Neither of the Wilders' respective lovers are ever more than ciphers. Mickey's
mistress could be taken for Annie's alter ego, but if this is so, what are we
to make of Oliver, an Englishman in the Hollywood mould, who spoils an illusion
of silent manliness by opening his mouth?
Mickey's affair is with an opinionated, athletic sculptress who earns his
daughter's antipathy by wearing cheap underwear. The attraction seems to be
that she is younger than Annie, who wastes no time small-talking Oliver,
flaring into passion with something more than a need for revenge.
All of which seems to suggest their long-term commitment was based on nothing
more than a lack of opportunity, though we are assured this is not so. Yet to
underline the message, and with typical Californian excess, their accountant
makes off with the loot. Annie gives chase, thinking: ``No-one would ever
believe this.''
There are moments when Gloria Nagy approaches the heart of the matter, when the
Wilders' dilemma is both complicated and convincing. There are times when she
seems to have her eye on the tensions and compromises of family life, and
provides a final twist which increases Annie's dilemma and adds to her feeling
of desperate resignation.

TELEVISION: ALLAN LAING
PETER MULLEN. This actor and director, if there is any justice, is surely going
to follow in the footsteps of Peter Capaldi and win the Oscar for best short
film with his bleak and uncompromising Tartan Short, Fridge. Also likely to
make a full-length film this coming year.
PAULINE QUIRK. The comedy actress best known for Birds of a Feather will make a
sensational impact in the coming year when she appears as an ugly, obese,
murderess in the BBC
adaptation of Minette Walters' seering crime novel, The Sculptress.
JOHN HANNAH. The Scots actor of Four Weddings and a Funeral fame will be given
his first lead role on telly if and when the network gives Scottish Television
the go-ahead to turn MacCallum, a thriller about a London-based pathologist,
into a series in the New Year. He will also be seen in bad-guy mode in a new
feature-length thriller by BBC Scotland, Bait.
EWAN McGREGOR. Like Hannah one of the new breed of young Scots actors, he will
be acclaimed for his rivetting performance in Trainspotting, the controversial
follow-up from the Shallow Grave team.
CLIVE RUSSELL. He seems to have been in just about everything this year
(Cracker, Ruffian Hearts, Roughnecks, Atletico Partick . . ). He must be in
line for a major lead role in TV. One of the best actors in Scotland, he'll be
seen later in the year in The Flowers of the Forest, a disturbing one-off drama
from Michael Eaton about ritual child abuse allegations.
KATE MURPHY. She made an impression in Donna Franceschild's last award-winning
drama, Takin' Over The Asylum, and will make an even bigger impression in the
same writer's next series, A Mug's Game, to be shown on BBC2 early in the New
Year.
EDUCATION: BARCLAY McBAIN
FRANK PIGNATELLI. Strathclyde region's director of education will quit local
government in April rather than take up a much less prestigious post - with
#94,500 salary conserved and access to a substantial pension - to which he is
entitled with cash-strapped Glasgow City Council. Can you keep a good, and a
driven, man down? 1996 will tell.
DOUGLAS OSLER. The man who had to sell the initially highly-unpopular version
of national testing - and suffered much parental ire in the process - has got
his reward by being appointed HM senior chief inspector of schools. What kind
of fist will he make of Higher Still, the forthcoming reform of upper secondary
schooling?
RAYMOND ROBERTSON. The Scottish Office Minister for Education wants more
schools to opt out and more families to take advantage of the expanded assisted
places scheme for the private sector. 1996 will tell if a significant number of
schools move to self-governing status, or if the vision continues to be a
pipedream.
HELEN LIDDELL. How much of the Tories' education clothing will Scottish Labour
steal? We shall find out early in the New Year when the Monklands East MP
produces Labour's blueprint for Scottish education.
Prof JOHN MacBEATH. The value schools add to their pupils' experience is
recognised as the key pointer to their effectiveness. Professor MacBeath and
his team at Strathclyde University are chasing that Holy Grail. Their report on
effective schools is eagerly awaited.
BRIAN MacKINNON. Where will the manchild turn up next in Scottish education,
and in what guise? Not in one of our medical faculties and certainly not as one
of their students. Of course, in 1996 the Government will run pilots to test
nursery vouchers.
MEDICINE: ALAN MacDERMID
NEIL WILSON and ALAN HOUSTON are consultant cardiologists who have pioneered
the use of catheter intervention to treat heart defects at the Royal Hospital
for Sick Children in Glasgow. A new, state-of-the-art catheter lab is planned
at Yorkhill.
Dr CAROLINE BLACKWELL is an expert on the factors which increase some people's
susceptibility to disease, in particular the way in which viruses, genetic
factors, or cigarette smoke make the cells in our mouths ``stickier'' and more
hospitable to bacteria.
Dr MOIRA BROWN, a scientist at the MRC Institute of Virology in Partick,
Glasgow, has played a leading role in disarming the herpes simplex virus of the
protein through which it causes damage to the cells in the brain and other
parts of the nervous system.
Dr DONNIE BLACK, from Stornoway, has been involved in Scotland, England and
America with the hunt for the gene mutations responsible for familial breast
cancer, the first of which, BRCA1, was identified last year.
Prof DAVID LANE heads a top-flight team of scientists in the Cancer Research
Laboratories at Dundee University. His discovery of the tumour suppressor gene
p53 could point the way to a new generation of cancer drugs. With his
colleagues - including wife, Dr Birgitte Lane, and Professor David Glover - he
has helped to justify Dundee's City of Discovery title.
LITERATURE: HARRY REID
NICOLA BARKER. Regarded by many as the best young short story writer around,
the acerbic Barker used to work in the kitchen of a children's hospital and has
more of a grip on the realities of life than many of her more precious
contemporaries in literary London. Watch out for her second collection of
stories, Heading Inland, from Faber in the spring.
AJAY CLOSE. Close is, well, closer to home. The Scottish journalist must be
delighted at the advance publicity for her first novel, Officialand Doubtful.
Secker &amp; Warburg publish it in February.
CARL MacDOUGALL. Carl needs little introduction to Herald readers; he is our
chief fiction reviewer and a regular contributor to many parts of the
newspaper. The Casanova Papers, set in Paris and Glasgow - always a potent
combination - is his best yet. This powerful novel comes out in May, again from
Secker.
NIALL DUTHIE. Less well known than MacDougall is this older, expat writer. He
is returning from Spain early in 1996 to launch his second novel, Natterjack,
which is partly set in Edinburgh and for which his publishers, Faber, have high
hopes.
ALAN FURST. If there is one author who deserves to achieve widespread acclaim
in 1996, it is Furst. His new novel, The World at Night, is published by
HarperCollins in October. Meanwhile, the paperback of his last, The Polish
Officer, is out in January.
FRANK KUPPNER. Finally, we have Glasgow's own Mr Kuppner, whose unexpected
success in the McVitie's will raise his profile. The small but enterprising
Edinburgh house of Polygon bring out his latest novel, Life on a Dead Planet,
in February.
CINEMA: WILLIAM RUSSELL
SANDRA BULLOCK. In the last year her roles as the bus driver in Speed, the
computer expert in The Net and the girl in love with a stranger in While You
Were Sleeping confirmed her as a star in the making.
NICOLE KIDMAN. Until her homicidal weather girl in To Die For this talented
Australian actress was best known as Mrs Tom Cruise.
RICHARD LA GRAVENESE. Without a script there is no film, and La Gravense has
over the last year established himself as among the best there are at turning
novels into celluloid gold with The Bridges of Madison County, the enchanting
tale of a waif amid thieves. A Little Princess, and Diane Keaton's debut as a
director, Unstrung Heroes.
MARTIN CAMBELL. Although his TV career as a director is distinguished, a veil
is best drawn over his cinema past, but Goldeneye has shown he knows how to
make genuinely exciting action adventure films.
HUGH O'CONNOR. This Irish actor's beguiling performance as the mass poisoner,
Graham Young, in The Young Poisoner's Handbook was brilliantly concieved, and
with luck - because it all depends on the parts that turn up -he should go far.
GEORGINA CATES. Her Stella, the repertory theatre trainee whose innocence
causes havoc in the lives of all around in Mike Newell's An Awfully Big
Adventure was amazing. She stole the film from Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant.
SPORT: JAMES TRAYNOR
STEPHEN GLASS. Aberdeen's emerging young fullback. In the modern game he is
described as a wingback, a player who starts wide of the defence but spends as
much time as possible lending support to his midfield and attack.
DAVID COULTHARD. Perhaps the Formula 1 driver from Twinholm in the Borders
should have started his Grand Prix career in 1995 in a team which wasn't
expected to win the championship, but by moving to from Williams Renault to
McLaren Mercedes, who are developing a new car which they hope will take them
back to the No 1 position, Coulthard can concentrate on his own development.
COLIN McRAE. He ought to be worth following. Only recently he became the first
British rally driver to win the world championship and he is young and bold
enough to secure back-to-back titles.
PRINCE NASSEEM HAMED. We should really keep our eyes on this man who is the
most exciting fighter to appear in the boxing ring in decades.
ALAN MACKIN. This teenager from Paisley has been making sterling progress
through the ranks and is a member of the Lawn Tennis Association's Rover team.
THE TARTAN ARMY. I suggest we all watch the Man in Threadbare Kilt and
Old-fashioned Football top with Scotland's finest gearing up for a march south
of the Border in the summer for the European Championship finals.
CLASSICAL: MICHAEL TUMELTY
SALLY BEAMISH. Since moving to Scotland around five years ago, the composer has
gone from strength to strength. The new year sees her order books full.
JOSEPH SWENSEN. Taking up his new post as principal conductor of the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra in 1996, American Swensen is exciting news; so far,
everything he has touched has turned to musical dynamite.
TAN DUN. More musical dynamite for Scotland with the appointment of Chinese
composer Tan Dun to the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.
HE WHO CANNOT BE NAMED. The BBC  SSO is on the verge of announcing the
appointment of a new principal conductor.
ANGELA WHELAN. Starry young trumpeter, still a student at the RSAMD, and
already making a name and reputation for herself. Definitely a classy musician
to watch out for. Appearing in February with the Scottish Bach Consort in a
tribute concert to Sir Alexander Gibson.
BRYAN ALLEN. Just in the door, Allen, leader of the Fine Arts Brass ensemble
and newly appointed head of brass at the RSAMD, has launched a big band at the
academy within his first term.
BUSINESS: ALF YOUNG
FRED GOODWIN. Less time under the bonnet restoring old cars when this intense
37-year-old accountant finally takes the executive reins at Clydesdale Bank
from departing Aussie, Frank Cicutto. One of the tough new breed of non-banking
bankers taking a traditional industry by the scruff of the neck and giving it a
good shake.
BRIAN STEWART. Courage is in the bag and chairman Sir Alick Rankin departs to
chair General Accident from early 1977, so the soft-spoken chief executive of
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, now the UK's biggest brewer, has his chance to step into
centre stage. The rave reviews should multiply.
ROBERT SMITH. The local profile has slipped a bit since the sharpest accountant
ever to emerge from Maryhill left the Royal Bank's investment banking offshoot
for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. Still a grandmaster of buy-outs in Europe, he
becomes president of the Scottish chartered accountants institute in April.
TOM HUNTER. With the deal to purchase the Olympus sportswear chain from Sears
complete, the boy from New Cumnock who started selling shoes from his father's
lock-up is poised to become a really serious UK retailer.
BRIAN SOUTER. Love him or hate him, the co-founder of the UK's largest bus
fleet, Stagecoach, now has his chance to prove the Perth-based group can weave
the same spell with trains in south-west England.
JIM FAULDS. Nice man, running successful ad agency. Having cheekily poached the
hugely creative Jim Downie from arch rival The Leith Agency, Faulds now has to
prove a Scottish success story can rival anything to be found in London's
ad-land.

n.SOMETHING about wrens has always got to humans. The midwinter ``wren hunt''
is one of the widest pre-Christian rituals in Europe. Sometimes it is killed,
sometimes caged, sometimes made a king. Maybe it is to do with its size, or
maybe to do with sex: ``The wren goes to it and the gilded fly does lecher in
my sight.'' But the wren would not die for adultery. It is one of the 20% of
common songbirds for which polygamy is a natural way of life. Males mate with
several females, but females with only one male.
This raises some interesting questions. Why do they do it? Why do the females
put up with it? Polygamy is thought to be the fundamental mating system for
animals; females must choose mates carefully as they invest more in their
limited number of young than the carefree and unchoosy male does in his sperm.
Most birds are monogamous because they need both partners to raise young and so
leave any genes to posterity. Not so the wren?
It may be that polygyamy is likely when there is a vast disparity between the
quality of the male's territories. Females find it more productive to be the
second mate of a rich wren than the only mate of a poor one. The male builds a
number of nests and sings loudly outside each. The female chooses the nest for
its safe inconspicuousness; she chooses the male for his conspicuous energy in
defending a large area of good feeding for her nestlings.
So now we begin to understand wrens: that mouse-like scurrying flight, those
domed nests tucked into crevices (no wonder the Latin name, troglodytes, means
cave-dweller) and above all that incredibly loud, vibrant, piercing song.

Jim Hewitson argues that to map out the future we should listen to echoes of
the past
.
DID you notice the bewitching advertisement in The Herald a few weeks ago
seeking experienced psychics, clairvoyants, and fortune-tellers, and another
offering training in the secret arts? This is a bit scary and not just because
we're dabbling in the occult.
Why such a shortage of seers? Is business booming or is there a more sinister
story to be told? Perhaps the now widely trumpeted prediction of the world's
end in 1999 is gaining credence and the gazers into crystal balls and chicken
livers, quite literally, see no future in the trade or in anything else for
that matter.
Over the years I've given a lot of thought to this business of peering into the
future - reading teacups, scanning tarot cards, or interpreting cloud
formations (amazing what you can see up there after a jar or two). You name it
and someone, somewhere, will have used the medium to indulge in a bit of
soothsaying.
In this column, however, one theme consistently spins into view and that is the
cyclical nature of Scottish history, world history, and presumably existence
itself.
Despite the apparent linear progression of our lives, a succession of days,
months, and years speeding by in a dizzy blur, there is an underlying whirlpool
effect, a circling of events not just in individual lives but in society at
large. The big wheel keeps on turning.
It ill behoves a feckless gowk like myself, coming as I do from Covenanting
stock, to advocate some dwamie Buddhist concept of the nature of existence when
predestination should be my bag. But I can only say I have found life thus, and
in any case I don't regard the two ideas as mutually exclusive.
So, what I offer on the precipice of a new year is a pocket soothsaying kit - a
chance to impress your friends and family with predictions for the coming year
simply based on happenings in the 96th year of previous centuries. I'm willing
to bet we're not far off the mark.
First look for interesting developments in the cinema and in politics. Among
the big events of 1896 was the first public screening of a film and the first
screen kiss, while the Scots took a drubbing at the first battle of Dunbar
(1296). Cinema and politics: in 1996 will the SNP ride to victory on the broad
shoulders and brave heart of Mel Gibson?
In health and medicine watch out for new hospitals and/or some stunning
technological innovations. In 1196 the St Nicholas Leper Hospital in St Andrews
was in the midst of a development programme and in 1896 Glasgow Royal Infirmary
became the first hospital in the United Kingdom to operate an X-ray unit.
In the sporting arena, much as I'd like to predict a glory year for the
Bankies, it is to the Fair City of Perth we must look. In 1996 we will mark the
600th anniversary of the famous formal and bloody clan battle on the North
Inch. St Johnstone for the Cup? I wonder. Whatever, let's hope there are more
survivors on the park this time at game's end.
How will our big neighbour south of the Border treat us in '96? Well, in 1296
Edward I nicked the Stone of Destiny and in 1696 English support for our Darien
scheme was withdrawn. Not encouraging portents, I fear.
So remember, as you peer over the edge into a new year, there probably is
indeed a route map through this confusing life, but many roads to your
destination and more than a few roundabouts to negotiate.

Clare Henry talks to a talented furniture maker
whose mother still hopes she'll get a `proper job' .
A WOMAN furniture maker is rare, but from her name, Michaela Huber was
obviously expected to be a boy. When, on leaving school, she took a three-year
apprenticeship as an artist cabinetmaker or ``kunstschreiner' in a Bavarian
workshop in her native Germany, her mother was not impressed. ``Yes, she's
still hoping I'll get a proper job and a husband!''
In fact, Huber has done well with ``proper jobs'', the latest being the
furniture for Reidvale Housing Association's new phase IV sheltered housing in
Dennistoun, which was opened with great success at the end of September.
Huber's furniture is just part of several craft commissions for the building,
including lovely etched glass panels on the stairway by Reinhard Behrens and a
disappointing clock from Gordon Burnett.
Huber's furniture was no disappointment. A curved love seat plus two very solid
oak and iron benches - too heavy to be pinched - sitting outside in the central
garden courtyard, were much enjoyed in the unique warm weather. Hopefully, they
will continue to provide a perch for residents in summers to come.
I first saw Huber's love seat in an exhibition at Greywalls put on by
Edinburgh's Scottish Gallery but wasn't familiar with her work. A visit to her
studio in Gogar Old Church, near Corstorphine, was revealing. Sited on the
outskirts of Edinburgh, hidden up a track off the busy Glasgow Road in an
idyllic pastoral setting, it accomodates three furniture makers: Huber, Chris
Holmes, and Chris Scotland.
``I couldn't work alone!'' says Huber. ``I get inspiration from the others as
we all do different things in different ways.''
Holmes found the tiny atmospheric but derelict church in 1982 and restored it
to make a workshop. It dates from 1890, although one of its crowstepped gables
is part of the chancel of a former bit from the 16th century, while the
original chapel dated from the 12th century. Squat, with stained glass, a
northwest tower, (the spire was never built,) it has a small kirkyard right out
of Samuel Palmer, the cows lowing over the hedge.
All three artists prefer to work on one-off commissioned pieces, (costing
between #200-#8000) with Holmes currently making a dresser for a private
commission and Scotland creating ``an amazing balcony/deck'' for a house in
Edinburgh.
Huber likes hills and walking, (last weekend she was busy protesting with the
Ramblers' Association about the Scottish Office closure of a public right of
way in parkland at Middleton Hall near her home) and came to Scotland because
of its landscape.
In 1982, on a visit to the dentist in Munich, she saw some photographs of the
Scottish Highlands in a magazine. She liked what she saw, left Bavaria behind
for travels round Europe - but never got further than Lochaber.
She moved to Edinburgh in 1983, working at Whytock and Reid, the well-known
Scottish cabinetmakers established in 1807. She was the first woman ever to
have worked there. ``It was interesting for a while but I felt it was a little
like being in a zoo - there were lots of VIP visitors and I found it
off-putting. I was expert at restoring German traditional furniture, so I did a
lot of their restoration: church chairs, Penicuik chairs.
``It's sad that Scotland has no tradition of apprenticeships because there is a
need for training. Most young furniture makers here have been at art colleges
studying art and design. But I believe they are too academic, not enough hands
on. Few of them can use materials to their best advantage - the quality of
craftsmanship is just not there. Students don't get enough cabinet making.
There's still a lot to be said for the apprenticeship system.''
In 1984 she moved to Ben Dawson Furniture in Musselburgh, making modern office
and board room furniture, but in 1987 decided to go freelance, ``a leap in the
dark'', taking space in the sawdust strewn Gogar Church.
``We share big machinery and equiptment like the dehumidifier but have our own
hand tools. You get really attached to your tools. We get our own logs, native
woods, saw them up: yew, elm, holly, apple, sycamore from fallen trees at
Linlithgow and elsewhere. It's a nice thing to do. Just think, making furniture
out of a log, it extends the life of a tree by 300 years.''
The church has really thick walls and they have a sawdust burner stove, so it's
not too cold in winter. The dog, called Sprocket, likes the stove. The scent of
new wood being worked adds to the homely workshop. The dehumidifier, a big
walk-in box, sits to the side of where the alter used to be, taking up one
whole corner. ``It reduces the wood by 10%. If you don't do that, when you put
a piece of furnitre in a house with central heating, it starts to jump about
and split.''
Huber describes her philosophy or design approach as ``menschlich'' or
``putting people at the centre, emphasising comfort, a feeling of wellbeing and
at the same time delighting the senses''. She works with clients over a period
of months, making drawings and scale models till both are satisfied. ``I don't
have a particular style. I'm not interested in that. I'm strictly a
craftswoman. I don't consider myself an artist.''
Julia Radcliffe, who managed the Reidvale Annbank Street art project, thinks
otherwise. She's keen to get artists involved in new urban buildings in
Glasgow, and was commissioned to report on the potential importance of
including art in the housing sector. Reidvale's architect, Murray Design Group,
aimed to put art in its buildings from the initial design stage.
Radcliffe advertised for craftsmen for Reidvale, then presented a ``long list'
of 20 artists. ``The committee chose three, including Huber, who they believed
could contribute to this user-friendly building for elderly people. The client
did not want `decoration,' rather strong, simple, pared back solutions.''
Molendinar Park, Reidvale's sister organisation, is also commissioning artists
to work on its new building at Bellgrove Street. Meanwhile, Huber has just
completed three new Celtic Benches for East Kilbride town centre, again working
with blacksmith Phil Johnson, of Ratho, who makes the curved ironwork for all
the seats. One bench has just won the 1000 Premier One prize at Edinburgh's
SAAC exhibition at the RSA and several more are destined for Leith and
Edinburgh's Elm Row.
Huber will make you a solid kitchen table in elm, oak or beech from #300 to
#600; a coffee table from around #200; a board room table for #4,500. A rocking
chair, made to measure, takes three weeks. ``I like my customers to come to the
workshop while I'm working on the piece.'' Well, it may become an heirloom
after all.

I want to see the police taking the emphasis off the motorist and going after
the knife killers and the drugs dealers and all the other crime. I stand
outside my store and I see mothers with their shopping and their two children,
and their car has been taken away, and all they've done is park in the wrong
place. And, now the Bosnian situation is resolving itself, I would like this
year to be a year of peace. I would love to see the countries get together and
do something about peace.

BATMAN FOREVER (retail, #14.99; also available to rent; certificate PG). This
is easily the best of three comic-strip action adventures released this month -
though up against Judge Dredd and Tank Girl (see below) that might sound like
praising with faint damns.
Batman Forever rings a few changes on the personnel of the previous two films
in the series. Val Kilmer takes over the cape and mask from Michael Keaton; Tim
Burton moves upstairs to the producer's office and leaves the director's chair
to Joel Schumacher; and Robin the Boy Wonder finally makes an appearance in the
person of Chris O'Donnell.
Most of these changes are positive - Kilmer delivers a darkness and duality
that Keaton could never manage, and O'Donnell makes a useful foil for Kilmer to
bounce his personality off of.
However, Schumacher's direction lacks Burton's wild flights of fancy, and when
it comes to narrative drive he's no more coherent than his famously plot-hating
predecessor.
Batman Forever actually kicks off with a strong plot idea - the invention by
Wayne Corporation electronics geek Jim Carrey of a virtual-reality
entertainment gizmo that not only turns its users into zombies but can steal or
manipulate their thoughts.
Having established this notion, however, he throws it away and scarcely
mentions it again. In lieu of a story, we get two enjoyably over-the-top
performances from Tommy Lee Jones, as the facially and psychically scarred
villain Two-Face, and Carrey as a high-camp Riddler.
Batman Forever is a show - a couple of hours of streamlined thrills and
throwaway laughs. As Barry Humphries might say, it's a nice night's
entertainment.
nJUDGE DREDD (rental, cert 15).
Let's cut to the chase: the best thing about Judge Dredd is that when you rent
it you get a free copy of 2000 AD, the comic in which the grim lawman began and
continues his career of meting out instant justice to the creeps, crims, and
perps of Mega-City One. The strip is fast, funny, and stylish; the film is a
slow, dull mess.
Everything you heard about the Judge's troubled movie gestation is right up
there to see on the screen: star Sylvester Stallone and director Danny Cannon
obviously had two different films in mind, and the compromise combo is less
that the sum of its parts.
One problem is that, in America, irony is a word that describes the taste of
Perrier.
Another problem is that it looks as though it was edited the way Willaim
Burroughs edits his books: somebody threw all the footage in the air and
stitched together whatever bits came first to hand. A honker, a howling dog, a
stinker in 48 different keys.
nTANK GIRL (rental, cert 15).
Like Judge Dredd, Tank Girl has its roots in the British comics scene, being
the adventures of a feisty, beer-swilling punkette who lives in the
post-apocalypse Australian outback, drives a tank, and bides in with a mutant
kangaroo called Booga.
Also like Judge Dredd, it's lousy; in fact, it's even worse than Judge Dredd.
At least that film didn't make the mistake of incorporating montage sequences
of the original comic strip just to remind how much better that was than the
witless, charmless, style-free fiasco you're watching. Lori Petty stars, for
her sins.

q My wife and I have Tessas maturing in January and would appreciate your
comments on re-investing in Tessas up to the maximum allowed and the balance in
investment trusts. We have retired early, both in our fifties, and have
index-linked pensions which cover our day-to-day needs comfortably. We are both
basic rate taxpayers and are homeowners with no mortgage or other commitments.
We seek to invest with minimum risk and primarily for growth. Our current
investments are: 4357 Sun Life distribution bond, 900 BT, 2500 Edinburgh
Investment Trust PEP, 650 Dunedin Income &amp; Growth PEP, 3070 Schroder UK Growth
PEP, 2340 Foreign &amp; Colonial, 1420 Scottish Mortgage, 116 Alliance Trust, and
700 KEPIT. We also have #23,000 in Tessas and #7000 on deposit.
n Your strategy - including investment in Tessas - is a sound mix of risk-free
and equity investment which should yield good results over the long term. It
might, however, be worth switching more of your existing investment/unit trust
holdings into PEPs in the new tax year, not so much for the benefit now but in
case you need more income in the future.
q I am likely to be over the capital gains tax limit this year and my wife not
at all. I believe I can transfer some shares to her before April 6 and make use
of her allowance for 1995-96. I also think she would have the full benefit of
all indexation allowances due from the original purchase dates of the shares.
Can you confirm this?
n Transfers of assets between spouses are regarded as made on a no-gain,
no-loss basis, so there is no tax payable when the gift is made. Your wife will
be treated as having acquired the shares at your original cost at date of
purchase and this, together with the full indexation allowance from that date,
will be available against the proceeds of sale next year. Her annual exemption
of #6000 will be available against the disposal.
q It has been suggested that for future income I put #15,000 in a life
assurance distribution bond from which up to 5% can be taken each year tax
free. In what way, apart from the small tax advantage, will this be better than
opting for unit or investment trusts and taking 5% each year?
n It would probably be preferable to do the latter because bonds of this sort
can carry higher charges and have performed less well on balance. The more you
can put into PEPs the better as these will be much the more profitable
investment.
q I have 500 shares in Thorntons which have done nothing much over the seven
years I have held them. I would be prepared to be speculative with the proceeds
of these and was considering transferring into an investment trust such as
Dunedin Enterprise. However, the recent upheaval at Dunedin has made me wonder
if it would be a suitable fund to invest in at present.
n The venture capital side of Dunedin which runs the Enterprise Trust has not
been greatly affected by the upheavals in the company and you can invest in it
with some confidence, so long as you are aware of the riskier nature of its
investment strategy. The trust has a good track record among its peers and the
management team is generally well regarded.
q We have a Royal Life Homestyle unit-linked policy which we started in April
1990 and is due to run until 2014. The level of cover is #15,000. We have since
reduced the mortgage capital sum by more than this amount so we do not need the
life cover. We are thinking of stopping the policy and putting the monthly #39
premium in an investment trust savings plan. Is this a wise?
n The disadvantage is that you are unlikely to get back even half of what you
have put into the Royal Life policy if you stop it. The question is which will
give you the better return, keeping the existing policy or changing to an
investment trust savings scheme. Given that part of the current premiums go
towards providing the life cover, the latter will probably give a superior
return over the long term.
q Any articles and adverts I have seen regarding investment trusts and unit
trusts that invest mainly in Preference shares or bonds seem to focus on their
high yields and relative degree of security but do no comment on future value
of capital.
I am looking for investments that provide a combination of high income and
capital values that keep pace with inflation in the medium to long term, so
could you please comment on this and offer any advice about alternative
investments that meet the above criteria.
n You are looking for the holy grail - an investment which offers high income
combined with capital values which are maintained in real terms. There is no
investment which can guarantee such an outcome. However, over the long term
equities have more than kept pace with inflation and provided a rising return,
which is also important for those dependent on investment income. You have to
be prepared for short-term fluctuations in capital values though.
Ten years ago the average equity income unit trust yielded 6.6% gross, against
8.5% for building society seven-day notice accounts. Within a couple of years
the income exceeded that from societies and by 1992 the gross yield on sums
invested in 1985 had risen to 12.4% before dropping back to 10.7% currently. So
they have delivered a rising income.
On the capital front, #1000 invested has become about #2300 in 10 years, though
between 1987 and 1993 they moved nowhere. Also there were two periods when
there were falls of about 25%, one of 20% and another of 15%. So it is
essential the long-term view is taken. While the future may not repeat the
past, the overall positive trend can be traced further back so there is a good
chance it will carry on.
q I propose to give a young relative a few shares. As he will not be a taxpayer
for some time, I presume he will be able to claim back the tax on dividends.
How does he go about this?
n If the child is under 16, it is necessary for the parents or guardian to make
a claim for repayment of income tax deducted. The child cannot apply personally
for a repayment unless he is 16 or over and the investment producing the income
in his own name. In addition, where he is under 18 and the income arises on
gifts from parents, it is not possible to claim repayment of the tax deducted
if that income amounts to more than #100 a year.
Where a claim for repayment is being made for the first time you must complete
Inland Revenue form R95D which you can obtain from any tax office. This
requests details of the child's name, address, date of birth and so on, and
also the name and address of the parent or guardian.
This should be sent to your local tax office which will issue a repayment claim
form. This is a simplified version of a tax return where details of the income
received and tax deducted can be entered. It should be submitted to the tax
office with the dividend vouchers which the Inspector will require before the
repayment is made. Further details are given in the booklet IR112 also
available from any tax office.
q I have an endowment policy which has another six years to run. Before that
time I would like to make it over to my son so he will have the benefit of the
sum assured. I have been told, however, that this will not prevent the capital
sum becoming liable to inheritance tax. Surely if the policy is in my son's
name when it matures there can be no question of a gift being made.
n The advice you have been given is partially correct - there is a transfer of
value for inheritance tax purposes where the benefits of a policy are
transferred or assigned as a gift or for less than full value. The value of the
gift is the value of the policy or, if greater, the value of the total premiums
paid by you to date, less any partial surrenders received on the policy.
Like most other transfers during lifetime, the assignation of the policy will
not be taxable if you survive seven years after the date of gift to your son.
It should, however, be noted that if you continue to pay the premiums on this
policy these are also gifts and, to the extent not covered by exemptions, each
one will also be subject to the seven-year rule.
Provided you retain no benefits under the policy and it is properly assigned to
your son, there is no reason why the capital should be liable to inheritance
tax if you survive the required seven years.

DURING the first half of 1996, the name Tessa will be on many savers' lips.
Existing investors in this type of tax-free bank and building society account
may soon have to decide what they are going to do with their money when it
matures. New savers may be tempted to open up an account.
Tessas were first introduced in January 1991. Many people took the plunge
immediately. Of more than four million who have opened accounts, two thirds did
so in the first year. These are now coming to the end of their five-year term.
Savers were permitted to invest up to #9000 over these five years. Tax-free
interest was added to their accounts. Final returns are set to range from
#11,300 to #14,000. The best results will come from those which offered
fixed-interest rates at the outset, with Bristol &amp; West's Capital Maker topping
the list.
But there were only a handful of these Tessas on offer initially, and
relatively few investors chose them because the rates they offered looked so
much less attractive than those whose rates could change once you were
invested. Fixed-rate accounts at the time were paying around 11.5%, while the
variable versions were offering up to 15%.
Since 1991 as general interest rates have fallen so too have the returns on the
variable Tessas. But some came down further and faster than others. The better
performances have come from smaller building societies and banks.
The Dunfermline Building Society produced one of the best results. More than
7000 investors who put in the maximum deposits over the period have benefited
from the society's competitive rates and maturity bonus. Spokesman Gordon Swan
explains: ``We wanted to encourage and reward longer term savers. We still
believe in maintaining a healthy Tessa rate.''
The most disappointing performances have been produced by the banks. Even the
TSB, which has been advertising itself as ``The bank that came first - top of
the bank Tessa performance table'', has produced a below average return
compared to all providers, though it has given better results than other banks.
The maturity value of the Clydesdale's Tessa is nearly #1000 less than the
Dunfermline's and nearly #500 less than that of the TSB, but a spokesman for
the bank was unrepentant, describing these differences as ``not significant''.
One wonders whether the customers would agree.
Savers with the Bank of Scotland got even less. Initially it refused to
disclose its returns, saying they might be ``misinterpreted''. A spokesman
says: ``Unlike a number of other Tessa accounts, ours did not require the
maximum amount to be invested or a feeder account to be opened.''
If you have a maturing Tessa, you have a number of options. You could spend the
money, of course, but if you want to go on saving you need to think carefully
about your choices. The rules allow you to roll over your capital, but not the
added interest, into a new account. If you have saved less than the maximum
over the past five years, you will be able to roll over your capital in the
first year and then top it up in future years to the full #9000.
It makes sense to roll over your savings into a new Tessa if it is money you
would keep on deposit anyway. There are some attractive roll-over products on
offer which run for another five years. But look carefully at the cash-in
penalties in case you need access to your money earlier.
There are more fixed-rate Tessas available this time round. The Clydesdale
appears to be trying to redeem its poor performance in the first round by
offering one of the highest fixed rates of 8% to existing customers who have
accumulated the maximum in their original account. The Dunfermline is also
offering an attractive 7.7% to previous investors. But cash-in penalties on
fixed-rate products tend to be higher than on variable rate accounts.
Also there is the question of whether interest rates generally will rise or
fall over the next five years. Nobody has a crystal ball but Graham Cooper of
financial adviser Chase de Vere says: ``With a General Election coming up and a
possible change of government, interest rates could well increase again, if
only temporarily. That is why I would opt for a variable rate Tessa.''
THE range of variable rate products is wide. If past form is anything to go by,
investors are likely to get a better long-term deal from a building society
than a bank. If you have a maturing bank Tessa, there is nothing to stop you
transferring. The Dunfermline is offering a variable rate account currently
paying 7.2% for transferred deposits of #3000 or more, and 6.2% on smaller sums.
You cannot reinvest the interest from your first Tessa in a new one, so
consider an alternative investment that is equally tax efficient. If you are
risk averse, you could put it into National Savings Certificates. But for
something more exciting, how about a personal equity plan?

LEWIS CARROLL:
A Biography
Morton N Cohen
MacMillan, #25
AUTHORS write under pseudonyms for a variety of reasons, some as banal as the
attempt to baffle the taxman. But when the Oxford mathematics don Charles
Lutwidge Dodgson claimed not to know Lewis Carroll, author of the Alice books
and The Hunting of the Snark, he surely alerted us that the two aspects of his
personality were as dissimilar as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Morton Cohen, an
American professor, sets himself the task of making sense of the divided
Dodgson/Carroll in a book whose erudition and scholarship is betrayed by the
thinness of its psychological insights.
Dodgson was a deeply unpleasant man, and in two very different senses. The very
worst sort of Oxbridge dons, he was desiccated, supercilious, sardonic, fussy,
spiteful, pedantic, obdurate, self-satisfied, reactionary, misanthropic, and
small-minded - the sort of man who cannot imagine the esoterica of Oxford and
the minutiae of Hebdomadal Council politics are of interest to anyone but a
handful of inverted pedants.
In fact, the entire panoply of ``effortless superiority'' of Victorian Oxford
rested on a risible foundation of religious belief that the average Hottentot
would have found puerile. Nobody can understand Dodgson/Carroll who does not
understand this deadly academic milieu, and Cohen sketches it very effectively.
Yet the second aspect of Dodgson's unpleasantness is less easily dealt with. As
is fairly well-known by now, Dodgson was a man of repressed and disturbed
sexuality - ``confirmed bachelor'' was the euphemism at the time - for whom
paedophiliac is not too strong an epithet.
Any doubt on this score will not survive a reading of Cohen's text and still
less a study of Dodgson's photographs here lavishly reproduced, which reveal a
genuine obsession with pre-pubescent girls; the four nude studies are
especially rebarbative. Alice in Wonderland, however one interprets it - and
the ``readings'' are legion - is a classic example of sublimation through
creativity.
Interestingly, Cohen reveals that Alice Liddell, daughter of the dean of Christ
Church who was co-author of the famous Greek lexicon, was herself a nasty piece
of work - a snobbish, domineering, class-obsessed, money-grubbing martinet and
domestic tyrant, the terror of ``below stairs''. Cohen convincingly argues that
Dodgson discerned her deep character during the famous ``endless summer'' of
1862, when he first told nine-year-old Alice Liddell the Alice stories, and
that this accounts for Alice's temper tantrums during the adventures in
Wonderland.
This book is full of fascinating stories, asides, and titbits, but suffers from
two main faults. Hostile as he is to psychological interpretations of his
subject, Cohen finds himself manoeuvred into banality, occasional philistinism,
and sometimes the downright absurd. Having scouted all psychoanalytical
readings of the man and his work, Cohen argues that Carroll, far from being a
pathological case, found children interesting because he had read Blake,
Wordsworth, and Dickens. According to this argument, all reputable teachers of
English literature, who have read these authors, should be morbidly obsessed
with very young girls!
The second fault with the book lies in the structure. A biography, of all
artefacts, ought to be relied on to follow a clear chronological sequence, yet
for the most part Cohen organises his material thematically, on relations with
publishers, etc. One feels that one has read a book of essays rather than a
life. The ultimate absurdity comes when Morton devotes a chapter to Dodgson's
parents two-thirds of the way through the book; clearly the proper place for
such a discussion is in Chapter One.
There is a lot of pure gold in this book but it is hidden among the iron
pyrites of lengthy quotes, legions of proper names, and a veritable Who's Who
of Victorian England. Specialists will doubtless be fascinated, but this
reviewer found all the doubling back on its own tracks and the failure of the
book to develop chronologically or, ultimately, to evince any real structure or
craftsmanship as wearying as watching a Godard movie.

Artist Douglas Gordon tells Ann Donald about his night time reading.
n I WAS travelling recently and decided to buy all three of Irving Welsh's
novels and read them within the week, starting off with Trainspotting. I liked
it a lot because the vocabulary invaded your mentality, which for me was quite
funny because I'm not an east coaster. The dialect was relentless and strangely
I could relate more to Welsh's language than when I read James Kelman. Maybe
it's a generation thing. I didn't find it such a horrible or bleak novel;
rather he dealt with the whole thing of drugs and casuals quite humorously and
didn't sanitise anything but dealt with it all very honestly.
I thought Acid House was good but didn't enjoy the short stories as much as
Trainspotting where the narrative was so chaotic. The characters flowed in and
out of each other like an extended family, which reminded me of Brett Easton
Ellis' style. Marabou Stork Nightmares I thought was just incredible. It was
really heavy but I enjoyed the whole deep, dark aspect. Maybe it was because I
was reading them all in succession but by the time I got to Marabou I was
crushed. The rape scene was one of the worst things I've ever read. And as for
the ending - and this probably says more about me than him - I just don't
believe in this idea of redemption. I think the main character should have died
suffering spiritually rather than physically. I thought Welsh let him off a wee
bit in the end.
I think Welsh is a great storyteller. The metaphors of abuse, recycled abuse
and then redemption in Marabou were quite simplistic but that's not necessarily
bad. At the risk of sounding totally pretentious I'd say that it was like a
Calvino book. He treads the same story again and again. But for me that's fine.
A young writer needs to get to know his territory.

n A Good-Looking Corpse, by Mike Nicol, Minerva, #7.99.
It's a pleasant change to read a book about black life in South Africa that
isn't either painfully pious or devoutly PC, and Mike Nicol's recreation of the
musical and social scene of the townships in the 1950s, centred on the
pioneering black magazine Drum, is a delight from beginning to end.
While never ignoring the miseries of apartheid, he reveals a raucous and
raffish subculture, based on dancing, jazz, zoot suits, and home-grown hashish,
whose inhabitants refused to be victims and defied their oppression by not
letting the Boers stop them having fun. Live fast, die young, and leave.
n Stigmata, by Padraig Standun, Brandon, #5.95.
The latest example of Ireland's thriving literary cottage industry of whimsical
comedies that take a poke at sanctity and sanctimoniousness in the 26 Counties,
Stigmata is a real inside job in that its author was ordained as a priest in
1971 - and for all I know, may still be one.
We're deep in the heart of what Dubliners call culchie country here, a
piety-ridden village in the West where bad language gets you barred from the
pub, the parish priest is suspected of communist leanings, a mad old woman
spends her time rebuffing the social services, and the odd miracle is
considered not all that remarkable. Droll and kindly humour with an edge -
great fun for all folks of Irish descent and those who wish they were.
n Clint Eastwood: Actor and Director, by Edward Gallafent, Cassell, #12.99.
Not so much a star biography as an attempt to give Clint Eastwood the place he
deserves in the history of the American movie, Edward Gallafent's book makes a
convincing case for the star of Dirty Harry as an auteur whose austere cultural
and historical vision has been denied serious recognition because his films
actually bring people in to see them.
Grouping his pictures within the genres and cycles to which they belong, and
relating them to broader movements inside and outside the cinema, current the
author diligently analyses the themes and attitudes of Eastwood's work and
creates a coherent critical portrait. Feeling lucky, punks?
n A Working Mother, by Agnes Owens, Abacus, #5.99.
One of the best but also the most underrated of the informal 1980s Glasgow
school of novelists that includes Alastair Gray (who drew this edition's front
cover) and James Kelman, Agnes Owens here adds a delightful touch of wry and
dry humour to the painstaking anatomies of working-class women's lives in which
she specialises.
It's still as dark a brew as ever - madness, adultery, fortune-telling, and
hard drinking are among its ingredients - but her spoonful of sugar helps the
medicine go down. Now if James Kelman would just discover a sense of humour too
. . .
n Hollywood People, by Douglas Thompson, Pan, #4.99.
Film fans with a taste for gossip and scandal - ie all film fans - will find
plenty of guilty pleasures in the book of Douglas Thompson's 1995 TV series
about life at the top and bottom (there is no middle to speak of) of the
capital of the movie industry.
This is the place Marilyn Monroe summed up as ``where they pay you $1 million
for a kiss and 50 cents for your soul'', where every waiter has a script in
development, and where only the most deprived 12-year-old on Sunset Boulevard
still has the nose she was born with. Sounds like heaven to me.

Margaret Rigillo bumps into P D James at the Spanish Steps and hears how her
disappointments are outweighed
by satisfaction
BATHSHEBA Abse, curator of the Keats-Shelley Memorial House in Rome, has a
favourite anecdote concerning P.D James. ``When the BBC Breakaway team were
over here preparing a feature on the Romantics, they were with me in the house
looking for a likely visitor to interview,'' she told me. ``Nobody they asked
seemed to speak good enough English, and they were about to give up - when who
should happen to come toiling up three flights of stairs but Lady James!''
P.D James was, of course, the answer to a producer's prayer - a famous author,
an eminent public figure, and a good off-the-cuff talker. She is also a genuine
Keats fan and she makes a pilgrimage to the little room where the poet died
every time she is in the Eternal City.
``I love his odes,'' she tells me, as we sit over a cappuccino in her hotel at
the top of the Spanish Steps. ``And I have immense respect for him as a human
being. I'm not a poet, but I think I understand something of the poetic
imagination. Maybe that's why I made Dalgliesh a detective poet. Great poetry
gives you solace in these moments of darkness, of grief and distress.''
Phyllis James's early life was not easy. She married young, at the outbreak of
the Second World War, and subsequently she had to shoulder the responsibility
of supporting her husband, who came home incapacitated, and two small
daughters. Widowed when she was 44, she never remarried.
``You don't forget...... Funnily enough, as you get older, you miss them more.
You see your grandchildren growing up and you think: Oh, why isn't he here to
see them, to enjoy things with me, to do things together...?''
In a moment, the shadow is gone. P.D James is the last person to indulge in
self-pity. She is an optimist, projected towards the future. At 75 years young,
the last thing she is thinking about is retiring. Indeed, she is already hard
at work on her next crime novel: ``Plot planning takes me almost as along as
the actual writing. I end up with enormous notebooks of ideas and information.''
After her incursion into a different genre with Children of Men in 1992 - ``It
was very much a one-off event. I found it a very painful book to write, but I'm
glad I did it'' - she returned to her poet-detective Dalgliesh with Original
Sin.
P.D James seems to have featured on our bookshelves for so long that it is
difficult to believe she was over 40 before she published her first novel,
Cover Her Face.
``I always knew I wanted to write books, but it just never seemed possible. I
always just had to concentrate on what I considered was a safe job with a
cheque at the end of the month.
``One day - I can remember it quite clearly - I thought: there's no point in
going on like this waiting for a good time to write my first book, because
there never was going to be a good time. I was already attending evening
classes to try to get qualifications in hospital administration so I started to
get up early in the mornings to write, before I went to work.
``I thought the crime-fiction genre would be a wonderful apprenticeship. I
loved the structure and I found it very supportive. But at the time I don't
think I believed that I was going to necessarily stay with it.''
Her eyes still sparkle when she recalls the day, 30 years ago, that she got the
news that her first novel had been accepted. ``When I learned I was going to be
a published author! That was a great moment!''
Other fondly remembered high points in her career are the two honorary degrees
conferred on her, by Buckingham University in 1992 (``I never got the
opportunity to go to university myself. My family couldn't afford it. I started
work at 16, and I've been working ever since'') and Glasgow last year. ``I had
a really lovely time - they had a piper piping me in!''
Although she enjoys all the accolades and adulation, they have not gone to her
head. A candid and straightforward writer, who has been going quietly and
unostentatiously about her craft for the past 30 years, she was astonished to
find herself, some months back, the object of an apparent denigratory campaign
when she was accused first, of snobbery and political incorrectness, and then
of snubbing the Crime Writers' Conference.
These allegations she publicly refuted, but the wound has not healed. Her voice
rings with indignation when she talks about it: ``It was a disgraceful business
really. It's the first time I've ever been attacked like that, on a personal
level. And all completely untrue. The journalists involved should have checked
their facts.
``I realised that if you are very successful, sooner or later you are going to
attract spite. I suppose I'm lucky that I haven't attracted it before this.''
And she laughs a little, shrugging it off: ``Fortunately, they can't take the
goodies away from me!''
The ``goodies'' include an OBE, a life peerage, and a string of crime-writing
awards, as well as stints chairing the prestigious institutions like the Booker
Prize Committee and Literature Advisory Panel of the British Arts Council, a
governorship in the BBC, and a seat on the British Council Board.
They also include her two daughters, to whom she is very close. ``They both
helped me with the research in Children of Men and I dedicated the book to
them.''
She told me of the new honour which is about to be bestowed upon her: ``The
National Portrait Gallery has commissioned my portrait. I believe that this is
the first time this has been done for a crime-fiction writer. They do have, I
believe, a portrait of Dorothy L Sayers hanging up, but they acquired that - it
wasn't commissioned.
``They asked me if I'd prefer to be painted by one of their famous
old-established artists, or by an up-and-comer. I said: `Oh, I'd rather have
someone up-and-coming'. A young man called Michael Taylor is doing it.''
During this latest trip to Rome, she has a busy schedule. She is to star in a
couple of literary events, and she will be wined and dined by the British
Ambassador.
``But I do have one day off,'' she says. ``I'm going to take a taxi and nip
down to see the Sistine Chapel.''
And this is the picture of her which has remained in my mind: Baroness James of
Holland Park standing unobtrusively in the queue, among the Japanese and German
tourists at the doors of the Vatican Museum.

TO a large extent, especially in my maturing years, it is still better to have
received Christmas presents that are hard. Soft generally means clothes and
after a few pokes and prods it's a safe bet the parcel will soon produce an M &amp;
S jersey or cardigan. Occasionally there's been the odd red herring; but the
boxed shirt is betrayed by its lightness and the jigsaw when shaken gives a
crinkly rumble instead of that pleasing murmur of settling liquid.
The Ultimate World Encyclopedia of Beer (#16.99) comes into the hard category,
and although you can't drink a book, if you could this one would be a classic.
If it were liquid it might be described as having full colour, being aromatic
as well as robust, with a subtle flavour that satisfies to the finish, leaving
a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. A probable ABV might be around 6.6%. Clearly one
to be respected but which on occasion may be lifted and laid during a session.
Beer is certainly a subject that lends itself to some extravagant treatment and
author Roger Protz has not missed the opportunity to bring out its colourful
characters with bottles, beermats and breweries swirling amid a spray of facts,
figures and fonts to bring cheerful animation to each page.
Credentials don't escape Protz either. He was one of the earlier driving forces
behind CAMRA and editor of its Good Beer Guide and is currently editor of its
monthly What's Brewing newspaper. His beer blethers have earned him leading
honours and he now sips his ale from a golden tankard.
Within the 224 pages, Protz goes on a global pub crawl and from Flanders to the
Far East visits leading breweries, sampling products and profiling each
company. He seems to have landed the ideal job, although he does return with a
few tales to tell. Behind many of those well-known beer labels some
entertaining and interesting facts emerge.
For instance, did you know that Heineken was so appalled by the depravity and
drunkenness caused by gin drinking he told his mother he would brew healthy
beer for the people if she bought the Haystack Brewery?
Chapters cover the making of beer and the beer business, beer and food, the
history of beer and the culture of beer drinking. For about the price of a
night at the pub or a reasonable carry-out The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Beer is
a good reference book for the enthusiast beer drinker or anyone interested in
this fascinating subject. It is certain to have a lengthy shelf-life.
Another gift that came in hard format, although this time towards the soft end
of the spectrum, was the World Beer Guide (#9.99). Written by Andrea Gillies,
who like Protz was editor of the Good Beer Guide, it is dominated by sections
dealing with tasting notes of bottled and canned beers that are available in
this country.
Over a six-month period she and her fellow tasting companion sampled more than
4000 beers - which seems to be nice work if you can get it. But everything in
the garden wasn't rosy. Despite their huge popularity, it is certainly true
canned beers are in a third division of taste leagues when compared with their
bottled cousins. In her tasting notes Gillies does not miss this point.
An unmentionable (and undrinkable?) has been thus described: ``Must be a joke.
Dark, plummy-brown beer with a caramel, roast-barley nose, and a sugar syrup,
corny, vaguely roasted, sweet and sticky palate. One of the crudest and most
unpleasant of British beers, and certainly not a pale ale, by even the most
imaginative definition.'' Ouch.
Occasionally Gillies' tongue unfurls around a beer and language more associated
with the wine taster streams out. A bottled blue-eyed boy was depicted as being
``rich brown coloured, with even richer, malty-fruity, butterscotch aromas. A
good, dry, prickly hop character, introducing a wonderfully soft, buttery (rich
dark toffee), fruity sweetness, with a little baked apple and the tiniest hint
of prune. Dark malts, succulent yeast fruits, vividly hoppy: this is an
admirably made ale, at once deeply mellow and arrestingly clean-edged.''
Clearly Gillies' tongue reaches tastes that others do not. Yes, nice beer if
you can get it.
n Making its baptism, albeit in minute quantity, is Red Cuillin from the Isle
of Skye. Available at Blackfriars, Brewery Tap, State Bar and Station Bar,
Glasgow; Coane's in Johnstone and the Bow Bar, Edinburgh.

THERE is nothing like a happy ending. When Elizabeth married Darcy and Jane
married Bingley, more than 10 million viewers, who tuned in to the final
episode of Pride and Prejudice for the double wedding, basked in the glow.
The married couples aside, no one is happier than Auntie Beeb herself. Pride
and Prejudice has been a huge commercial and critical success for the
corporation and, following on from Middlemarch and Martin Chuzzlewit, the
adaptation has helped ensure the classic serial is now an integral part of the
BBC's drama output, after a long period during the mid to late eighties when
whiskers and morning coats dropped out of fashion.
``They are now an essential plank of public broadcasting in our society,''
explains Michael Wearing, head of BBC's drama serials. ``With a literary
history as long as our own, you can't say we shouldn't do them.''
Already adaptations of George Eliot's Daniel Deronda, Daniel Defoe's Moll
Flanders, and Anne Bronte's Tenant of Wildfell Hall are all at various stages
of production, while Joseph Conrad's Nostromo, a novel that defeated the best
efforts of film-maker David Lean, has already been completed and will be shown
next year.
This Christmas, the boy's own adventure The Prisoner of Zenda graced our screen
for the umpteenth time.
Even ITV is planning a version of Jane Austen's Emma, its first costume drama
since Jewel in the Crown back in 1984.
``The BBC have proved there is a market for them,'' explains Wearing, the man
responsible for commissioning these adaptations. ``Oddly enough, they are now
more successful than when the BBC were doing two or three a year as a matter of
absolute course.
``There is no doubt that they are great stories and they seem to connect, which
I don't pretend to fully understand, but every time we've done one they've
caused a splash.''
However, as producers rush to the local library to see what other old
favourites can be rescued from the cobwebs, it's notable that the recent
revival seems to be drawing on the same small band of literary sources.
True, Middlemarch had not been adapted before last year, but the cameras have
turned on the works of George Eliot before. Dickens is a hardy perennial on
television and Andrew Davies's version of Pride and Prejudice comes just over a
decade after Fay Weldon's attempt in the early eighties, which itself was not
the first time the BBC tackled Jane Austen's novel.
Yet, with the much praised BBC Scotland's adaptation of A Scots Quair now
little more than a distant memory, the question arises, where are the Scottish
classics? Is the BBC only interested in serials for and about middle-brow,
middle-England?
``I hope if we do Middlemarch it does speak to people in Scotland, Ireland and
Wales as well as England,'' Michael Wearing says. ``There is a sense in which
writing in the English language, as written by Oscar Wilde or Walter Scott or
Jane Austen or anybody else has to belong to all of us.''
However, Wearing is aware of criticisms that the canon of great works upon
which the BBC draws does seem a little restricted. Unfortunately, he suggests,
the problem is money. ``These things aren't cheap. That's the biggest problem.
We can never entirely fund them ourselves. We can't actually do more than two
or three a year.''
He suggests that, as a result, there can be limitations on what the BBC can
afford to adapt. ``It's fair to say that more esoteric classics are not what
American producers want to invest in.''
It's a problem that BBC Scotland's own Head of Drama, Andrea Calderwood, is
well aware of.
``The problem with classics is that they're massively expensive to do and
normally they have to be co-produced. The Jane Austens are the ones everyone
has heard of and that American co-producers are familiar with, so that's a
reason why we in Scotland are at a slight disadvantage.
``In Scotland, we have less of the books everybody has heard of and that are on
everybody's school curriculum. There is a danger, however, of just doing the
curriculum classics. The same classics have been done over and over again.''
A few Scottish classics might help combat that danger and Calderwood is
certainly not averse to the idea.
``The way I look at our output, we should be doing things right across the
whole range. So at the moment, we're doing original serials like A Mugs's Game,
the popular series like Hamish MacBeth and there are hard-hitting serials like
Cardiac Arrest and I think the classics are something we should look at as well.
``I firmly believe if there's a good strong accessible story and if it's well
adapted and the scrip works on its own terms then there's no reason why we
shouldn't do it.''
At the moment, nothing has progressed further than the development stage, but
BBC Scotland is hopeful that its plans for adapting Walter Scott's Old
Mortality will come to fruition.
``What interests me is that we should try to find an original approach to the
classics,'' says Calderwood. ``And the reason we're doing Old Mortality is that
the writer Chris Hannan came to us just full of enthusiasm for what he saw as
the contemporary resonance of the book and because it's an accessible, strong
adventure story,'' Calderwood explains.
``A very few people have read it, but he felt it had something to say - it's
about the Covenanters, about sectarian divisions within Scotland and those are
the same problems we still have today.''
BBC Scotland is also hoping to adapt Irish novelist Patrick McGill's Children
of the Dead End, with a script by Bernard MacLavety.
``It's a story about Irish migrant workers coming to work in Scotland,''
Calderwood explains. ``I think it will have particular relevance here because
we tend to see ourselves as the people who tend to migrate and are treated as
underdogs. This is a story which turns the tables and says, `Well, this is how
Scots behaved as landowners and how they treated migrant workers at the turn of
the century'.''
An adaptation of Children of the Dead End would certainly combat the nagging
notion that it is only novels firmly couched in a bourgeois setting, with
plenty of opportunities to show off posh frocks, that get the nod when it comes
to television adaptations. There's no guarantee, however, that either of these
programmes will actually appear on the screen, as Calderwood admits.
``You have to ask is it a strong story and will it work for a television
audience and can it have a cast which people will have heard of? And, as the
projects we have are now in development, that's what I'm about to find out.''
Coincidentally, Michael Wearing is also looking to Scott for source material.
He is planning an adaptation of Ivanhoe for 1997.
``Ivanhoe trades on romance and action. Like Rob Roy or Braveheart, we're
talking about archetypal, semi-mythic characters which carry across
generations. It touches the fact that at that time society excluded the Jews,
or other elements of society, which is not so unfamiliar a story now.''
As the classic serial returns to television's centre stage, the opportunities
for adaptations that reflect life outside middle England will grow. And though
they have to survive in the Darwinian universe of television drama, short of
money and the recognition that attracts it, it would appear Scottish literature
will not be neglected. That's certainly what Andrea Calderwood is hoping for.
``Obviously, they've got to compete with other classics being developed in
England and in Ireland, but it's certainly possible.''

CRIME
n Dead Ringer, by John Francome, Headline, #14.99.
David Tredington returns unexpectedly to his home and family, having
disappeared at the age of 12. His father, Sir Mark, has no doubts about his
identity but his two sisters are less certain although prepared to give him the
benefit of the doubt - as is cousin, George, the next heir.
It is the beautiful Susan Buckley, his father's secretary, for whom David has
fallen, who is the only one to remain totally suspicious. The book opens in
October with David winning a race on one his father's horses, a success marred
by the death in a motor accident of a promising lad from Sir Mark's stables to
whom he was giving a lift home. Next follow two flashbacks - to September, when
he returned home, and to August, when he was first located and persuaded to
return by Sir Mark's godson - before moving on again to November where the
story moves towards its conclusion. Is he really David Tredington and, if not,
who? This is John Francome's best book so far.
n THE ISLAND OF THE DEAD, by Philip Hook, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #15.99.
This is also the name of a picture by Arnold Brocklin - a cliff rising from the
sea, steps leading to a darkened doorway, a boat rowed by an ancient oarsman, a
sinister passenger swathed in white. A fictional second version of the picture
forms the focal point of the book. This oil-painting hanging in a gallery in
London is vandalised and the irrefutable perpetrator is Thomas Donat, a wartime
Hungarian refugee to the US, who is visiting this country.
At about the same time, a memorial service takes place in St James's,
Piccadilly, for Alexander Courtney, a leading art dealer, which Dominic
Maitland, an art journalist who has been commissioned to do an in-depth study
of Courtney, attends. He is also commissioned by his paper to do an article on
the vandalisation of The Island of the Dead, thereby bringing the two threads
of the tale together. The relationship between Thomas and Greta Kassak in
wartime Budapest and the present day are dovetailed skilfully together to make
a coherent whole. Philip Hook, a director of first Christie's and then
Sotheby's, contrives to make the world in which he lives and works a vividly
clear background for a suspense story.
n BETRAYAL, by Clare Francis, Heinemann, #12.99.
This is another first-class thriller. Written in the first person, hero Hugh
Wellesley's business has been taken over, his marriage seems doomed, his
mistress has been found dead and, by the end of the first chapter, the reader
is suffering every ounce of his despair coupled with apprehension.
The ``betrayal'' of the title runs throughout: in the business, which may just
be recovered by a management takeover; in the marriage, where his wife has
taken to hosting charity fund-raising events as a compensation for his frequent
absences on business; and with the mistress, Sylvia, a girlfriend from some 16
years earlier who has accidentally returned to his life and with whom he has
almost involuntarily begun an affair. This affair is complicated by the
revelation that her recent life has been one of drugs and promiscuity.
n TEN LORDS A-LEAPING, by Ruth Dudley Edwards, HarperCollins, #14.99.
This is in a far lighter vein than the other three, but no less enjoyable. Jack
Troutbeck, the Mistress of St Martha's College, Cambridge, has become a life
Baroness. A Bill to abolish foxhunting is being taken through the House of
Lords and Lady Troutbeck, with the aid of Bertie, Duke of Stormerod, and
others, has taken upon herself the task of blocking it. Nothing very unusual so
far, you may say. But the methods employed by both the supporters and opponents
of the Bill to achieve their ends, including among other things, mass murder,
add a distinctly Tom Sharpeian atmosphere.

AFTER the release of the film Braveheart, the newly restored Wallace Monument,
perched high outside Stirling, trebled its figures in September to 30,000
people. There is no doubt movies like Braveheart and Rob Roy raise interest in
Scottish holidays.
There are more films to come too, with a new family story set at Loch Ness, to
be released in February. In addition to the monster, it stars Ted Danson as a
sceptical American scientist, and Joely Richardson, with a local lass as the
junior lead. The special effects for the monster are spectacular and should
send hundreds more to the area.
The Wallace Monument restoration was one of the benefits brought about by the
injection of public money under the Stirling Initiative, which has benefited
tourism along with other industries. Historic Scotland has already done much in
that most castle-like of castles, Stirling Castle, and this year saw the
completion of the Medieval Kitchens, which portray food and tableaux from the
past, and the opening of Marplace House, not far away, as the Cornerstone
Gallery.
In the spring, the Old Town Jail, once a detention barracks, will reopen its
ground floor as a Museum of Punishment and Crime. Following the principle of
keeping the Old Town as a place where local people live and work, the upper
storeys will be offices.
The Stirling Initiative has also made possible the re-cobbling of the Old
Town's Broad Street, and freed lower areas from cars, with a Heritage Tour Bus
in the season. This historic town, above the River Forth, is very popular for
weekend (or longer) breaks. Examples are: Stirling Castle Hotel, #55 per person
per night, D/B&amp;B; Forth Guest House: #24 person/night D/B&amp;B: two nights per
D/B&amp;B #75, plus Sunday free as long as dinner is taken. There are many more.
Information: Stirling Tourist Centre: 01786 475019.
Quite apart from the new film, Loch Ness and its monster and the area around
Inverness are always popular. Inverness Castle, above the River Ness that
divides the city, is the successor of many more militant fortresses. When it
closed its gates against Mary Queen of Scots in 1562, she recaptured it and
hanged the governor, whose ghost can still be seen in the vaults. The castle
esplanade holds a statue of Flora Macdonald.
It is only six miles or so to the start of Loch Ness, with the Loch Ness
Monster Exhibition Centre, at Drumnadrochit (01456 450 573). It is refreshingly
different from the usual ``themed'' centre in that it tells the history of the
search for the monster with some interesting scientific pictures. A very
popular spring and summer way to see the loch is by Jacobite Cruises, which
also sail into the Caledonian Canal (01463 241730).
As the Highland ``capital'', Inverness is the centre of a huge area, stretching
from John o' Groats to Cape Wrath and south to Fort Augustus. The Inverness
area alone offers Macbeth's Cawdor Castle (and gardens), said to be the place
where King Duncan met his end. Fort George, built against the Jacobites, now
holds the Regimental Museum of the Queen's Own Highlanders. Information: 0131
244 3101. Moniack Castle, along the inner firth, is home to a winery which
makes country wines from local sources, such as rowans and birch bark. Good
licensed restaurant. Information: 01463 831 283.
Again in 1996, the most celebrated place near Inverness will be Culloden, in
commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Bonnie Prince Charlie's ill-fated
attempt at the throne, which died on April 16, 1746, on this battlefield. The
great grave mounds show Culloden for the disaster it was and, despite a modern
audio-visual programme and a restaurant, there is always a sense of sorrow
about this peaceful place. Information: 01463 790 607.
In addition to this Jacobite anniversary, Scotland has several more in 1996.
One that should bring people from all over the world, as well as native Scots,
is the Burns International Festival to mark the bicentenary of the death of
Robert Burns, on July 21, 1796. The Festival was opened last September by the
Princess Royal, who unveiled a new statue of Burns by Alexander Stoddart, at
Kilmarnock Cross.
There will be hundreds of events - in places from Ayrshire's Alloway Kirk and
Souter Johnnie's Cottage to the Burns House and Monument in Dumfries, and much
wider. A National Burns Exhibition starts in Edinburgh, and Glasgow's Royal
Concert Hall will host the Burns Federation Concert, with a 500-strong Scottish
male-voice choir. A Tam O'Shanter summer spectacular will tour the country,
telling of Burns through song and dance, and include Son et Lumire.
Information: Burns Festival: 01292 288080. Accommodation: Ayrshire: 01292 2988
688; Dumfries: 01387 53862.
As usual, Glasgow will hold its annual Mayfest, the international arts festival
which has gone from strength to strength. There is also the Jazz Festival in
June. But Glasgow's main event for 1996 is the Glasgow Festival of Visual Arts
which, among other events, makes a feature of the work of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh. Starting in Glasgow (May 25 to September 30) it will move on to
three American cities: New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. The Festival of
Visual Arts will have many other components, including a Festival of Design,
and a Visual Art Fair in George Square.
Glasgow regularly runs ``breaks packages'', including a series of Extra Special
Breaks for 1996, which covers accommodation, travel, and tickets to a major
festival. Information: Greater Glasgow Information Centre: 0141 221 0049.
In 1996, the Edinburgh International Festival reaches its 50th year, and this
will be a momentous occasion, with the Edinburgh Festival Theatre adding
greatly to the quality of the venues. The Tattoo continues to flourish and
attract many overseas visitors but I have always believed all Scots should make
a point of being on the Castle Esplanade every few years. In 1995, Edinburgh
opened a new Conference Centre, close to the five-star Sheraton Grand Hotel and
the Usher Hall.
In addition to a plethora of hotels and guest-houses, the city has long made a
feature of first-class bed and breakfast accommodation. One group, Welcome
Homes, had its birth in the Festival some 15 years ago, by matching guests to
carefully chosen host families, and has continued to grow. Almost all hotels
and guest-houses in Edinburgh have special Festival packages and Welcome Homes'
1996 Festival packages include tickets for festival events, plus a Tattoo
ticket. Information: Edinburgh International Festival: 0131 226 4001. Full
brochure ready end-March, preliminary now. Edinburgh Information Centre: 0131
557 1700. Welcome Homes: 0131 332 0410.
Scotland is synonymous with climbing and hill walking, Munros and mountains.
The great walking routes, the West Highland Way and the Southern Upland Way,
which often follow the old drove and hill roads, have added another dimension
to long-distance walking, with overnights in the small communities en route, or
mountain huts.
In addition to the various mountaineering clubs, several companies offer group
walking, often with leaders for the less experienced. H.F Holidays is a good
example. Started earlier this century in the North of England to get industrial
workers away from their dark satanic mills, the company has built up a series
of houses all over Britain (and overseas), and has some 600 leaders who, among
other places, walk and climb in many parts of Scotland.
Walks are usually graded into Low, Middle, and High Level, indicating
standards. One of the attractions is the social life of H.F evenings - very
much a house party. There are houses on Arran, and at Loch Leven and Pitlochry,
with transport to walks that range widely. More challenging routes are tackled
on summer weeks such as Ridges and Scrambles of Arran and the same for Glen
Coe, and Munro Bagging, and in winter, in hill-walking and mountaineering
weeks. Prices for seven nights are reasonable, from around #250-#300 depending
on the season, and there are shorter breaks. Brochure: 0181 905 9388. Sales:
0181 905 9558.
Golf rides even higher on the Scottish outdoor list, though wildlife and
watersports run it close. Two or three places immediately come to mind. St
Andrews claims to be ``the home of golf'', though East Lothian would certainly
dispute that. St Andrews' Old Course Hotel, which looks over the famous Old
Course, now also has its own Duke's Course, in a lovely parkland setting
overlooking the links.
The Duke's Course is championship standard, and the hotel offers packages and
golf holidays. From spring 1996, for golf fanatics there is a basic package for
#160, per person per night which includes table d'hote dinner, a course guide,
and a round of golf per day on the Duke's Course. The minimum is two nights
with two people sharing. For golfers and non-golfers, the Leisure Break starts
from #125 per night for Dinner B&amp;B, and guests use the hotel as a base for any
for St Andrews' famous courses, while non-golfers explore old St Andrews,
Scotland's oldest university, the thriving Byre Theatre, and other places in
Fife. Both can luxuriate in the hotel's excellent health spa. St Andrews has
many other hotels, inns and guest-houses with course tee-times. Information:
Old Course Hotel: 01334 47427. St Andrews Tourist Information Centre: 01334
72021, April-September. Tourist Board: 01334 74609.
Also world famous are courses from Ayrshire and the South-west such as Royal
Troon, founded in 1878, and Turnberry, a familiar sight on many a television
screen, to Royal Dornoch in the north (rated one of the world's top 10) and
Caithness, which claims to provide some of Europe's cheapest golf. Grampian
also boasts some of the best. The Royal Aberdeen has a club going back to the
eighteenth century. It is a links course only a few minutes from the cobbled
streets of Old Aberdeen.
One of Aberdeen's newest ``old'' hotels, the Marcliffe at Pitfodels, run by
Stewart and Sheila Spence, well known for their time in Deeside, now has strong
ties with Royal Aberdeen, with special tee-times and so on, and there are
several more courses within close range. The Marcliffe is just as popular for
fine cuisine, served in the Conservatory Restaurant which, weather permitting,
also has a patio. Grampian's famous hills, valleys, and coastline have a range
of accommodation at all prices. Information: Marcliffe: 01224 861 000. Aberdeen
Information Centre: 01224 632 727.
East Lothian boasts some 18 golf courses, including Muirfield, Gullane,
Aberlady, and North Berwick, which also has a new course above Tantallon
Castle. A good base is the town's Marine Hotel, where the manager, Alistair
Risk, is a keen golfer and can often be seen encouraging his younger guests on
the Children's Course just outside. The hotel organises its own competitions
and weeks, with a special golf holiday at the end of June each year, which
tries to cover as many East Lothian courses as possible, ending with a
competition. Throughout the year the hotel has many golfers, but for less
interested folk it is also right in North Berwick. The town is a great place
for sailing, and has exciting boat trips out to the Bass Rock to see the great
white patch, growing larger each year, that is thousands of breeding gannets.
There is a special train (and buses) into Edinburgh, only 20-odd miles away.

There is a curious part of the Scottish psyche that seems to think ``north''
when going on holiday in Scotland. This often means that the Borders, or
Galloway in the South-west, are not as well-known as they should be. Not many
of the Braveheart devotees, for example, realise that there is a huge Wallace
statue high above St Boswells, very close to Dryburgh Abbey, and within walking
distance of Dryburgh Abbey Hotel. It is an impressive piece but well-hidden by
tall trees. Both these regions make excellent walking areas, with the Southern
Upland Way striding some 220 miles from Portpatrick in the west and Eyemouth in
the east. Galloway has the south of Scotland's highest mountain, the Merrick,
only a few feet below Munro status. Mountain-biking is also popular in these
uplands.
Another curiously similar area much further north, the Grampian uplands,
north-west of Aberdeen, stretching up to the south side of the Moray Firth, is
also excellent for horse-riding and trekking, with some 10 centres in
communities such as Grantown, Tomintoul, and Lossiemouth. Elgin Tourist
Information Centre: 01345 542 666.
The Borders are full of history, and strife between England and Scotland, with
the warring Border families deep into cattle reiving. The colourful Border
Common Riding ceremonies of today were then a necessity. In those warring days,
Border burghs such as Selkirk, Hawick, and Lauder had to ride their marches to
ensure that no thieving landowner or marauding English band had annexed any of
the town lands. The tradition of horse-riding has continued today for pleasure,
and Kelso Racecourse, and the many point-to-point meetings, are well
patronised. Thirlestane Castle at Lauder also hosts the BHS Scottish
Championships over an August weekend, with dozens of horses tackling the
terrifying cross-country jumps.
The Borderland has some fine mansion houses, beside the Tweed near Kelso,
Mellerstain House, Border peel towers like Smaillholm. There are famous houses
such as Abbotsford, built by Sir Walter Scott, also by the Tweed, where his
descendants, Mrs Patricia and Miss Jean Maxwell-Scott, are frequently on hand
to welcome visitors.
The mild south-western climate makes Galloway's great gardens bloom abundantly,
from the wonderful display of rhododendrons at Castle Kennedy, close to
Stranraer, to the lovingly-tended gardens of Ardwell House on the Rhins
Peninsula, and nearby Logan Gardens, now in the care of Edinburgh's Royal
Botanic Garden, and many more. Both regions have the sea - the dramatic eastern
Berwickshire coast, great cliffs at St Abb's Head, and the gentler Solway
coast, which leads to Scotland's southernmost point, the Mull of Galloway, with
its towering lighthouse. Both regions offer many holiday packages in hotels and
guest houses, caravan and camping sites, and bed and breakfast accommodation is
first-class. Information: Borders Tourist Centre: 01835 863 435, Dumfries &amp;

If Sir Hugh Fraser, who built the Aviemore Centre in the 1960s, could see the
Spey Valley now, he would be amazed at the transformation and the numbers of
visitors who come to Speyside all year round. So too would the pioneers of the
Cairngorm chairlift, who introduced many to skiing. Today they would see the
chairlift used year-round, the summer lifts packed with walkers, or visitors
going up to the restaurant and to admire the glorious view. From Dalwhinnie,
through Newtonmore, Boat of Garten Aviemore, Coylumbridge, Carrbridge, and the
rest, then on up to Inverness, the area is packed with things to do.
Many are connected with the outdoors - climbing, walking, fishing, mountain
biking, and pony trekking for a start. There are places such as Rothiemurchus
Highland Estate with falconry, ranger forest walks, fishing, and more. At the
Highland Wildlife Park at Kingussie, my pride of place goes to the wild cats
but, there are herds of deer and bison and also foxes and the rest. There is
energetic or easy walking and climbing (skiing in winter) in the peace of
Glenmore Forest Park, which takes in part of the Cairngorms, Glenmore Lodge and
Camping Park, and the Reindeer Centre is dedicated to Britain's only reindeer
herd, free-ranging out on the mountains, which can be visited with a guide.
Landmark, one of the earliest forest parks, today also has an emphasis on
Highland history, shared by the Highland Folk Museum at Kingussie. A
fascinating Heather Centre at Dalnain Bridge grows some 300 varieties, with
plants for sale and an interesting exhibition.
All these are only a taste, and in the Aviemore Centre itself, many of the
younger guests spend a lot of time go-karting. Between Aviemore and Boat of
Garten, the Strathspey Steam Railway makes an interesting contrast to the car,
with a lot of special trips. Information and accommodation: Aviemore &amp; Spey
Valley Information Centre 01479 810363.
I try to visit at least one Scottish island every year, sometimes a new one,
sometimes an old friend. This year I went to Coll and Tiree. Fascinating
islands, well out into the Atlantic yet relatively easy to reach by ferry from
Oban, or air from Glasgow. Tiree's long low stretches and its beaches are ideal
for birds and botany, cycling and golf.
But it is most interesting for the Skerryvore Lighthouse built by R L
Stevenson's uncle, Alan. Today the lighthouse's landward storehouse at Hynish,
plus the small harbour from which the builders travelled to the site, have all
been restored. It is now an ideal place to stay. Close by is Skerryvore Museum,
in the old signal tower.
Coll, only a few miles away by boat or ferry, is unusual in that its population
is growing. Here there are seals and Breadach Castle, the ancient seat of the
Coll Macleans, restored by Nicholas MacLean-Bristol and his wife, who founded
and run the Project Trust. In a specially-built house, the trust trains young
volunteers for work all over the world, a bit like VSO. At other times, the
house is available for paying visitors, and there are a couple of small hotels
and guest-houses. Coll's great asset is the corncrake, which owes its survival
to traditional agriculture, and croaks its way through the night. This may
produce a love-hate relationship with the locals but it brings birders galore
to the RSPB reserve, and there are seals and expeditions to smaller islands by
boat.
All along this western coast, with its inlets and peninsulas, islands and sea,
one is never far from water. Roads wind and have wonderful views and every
island is different. Arran has northern, mountain scenery in a southern
location. Islay has a famous golf course and hotel and six - or is it seven? -
distilleries. Every visitor is sure to want to try out Skye's new bridge in
1996; Gigha has great gardens; and Mull, with two castles and the Mull Little
Theatre, is close enough to Oban (an excellent base for Argyll too) to be busy
and bustling. It is also on the way to the Holy Isle of Iona with its abbey and
community.
Mull gave me my first sighting of an otter, sitting up on a rock eating a fish,
though that would have been a more likely first in Orkney or Shetland to the
north. For these are magnificent wildlife island groups, with many unexpected
offerings. But though I first went for birds and wildlife, I soon discovered
archaeology too, for both, perhaps Orkney in particular, have magnificent
sites, some 4000 years old such as Orkney's standing stones, the Ring of
Brodgar, and Maes Howetom. Jarlshof in Shetland stretches between the Bronze
Age and Viking times.
The Outer Hebrides are another world, but that does not mean a town like
Stornoway lacks a golf course or a swimming-pool and a busy social life. But in
Lewis, Harris, the Uists, Barra (where the thrill is landing on the beach by
air) and the rest, there is always a sense of being far north-west on the very
edge of Scotland and in a land of the Gaels.
No-one specialises more in Scottish islands than D A Study Tours, of Culross in
Fife. The tours are mostly led by a specialist in the area or subject, but
there are a few programmes for independent travellers. In 1996, D A Study Tours
will visit Lewis, Harris, Barra, and Vatersay in the Western Isles, Islay,
Jura, Colonsay, Gigha, Coll, and Tiree, and more further south. The holidays
usually last five or six days, travelling by coach and ferry, staying in hotels
and cost from around #230-#390 per person. The company also visits Orkney and
Shetland, as does the specialist firm, Island Holidays, whose 1996 programme
includes Natural History in Orkney, and a similar 10-day programme in Shetland.
Both are led by specialists. Prices range from around #645-#680, by air/coach.

But many like their active holidays to be productive too, and want to work hard
when away whether it be digging or diking, roofing or raking.
Aching muscles, this school of thought claims, give a great sense of
achievement! Various organisations offer working holidays. The National Trust
for Scotland (NTS) runs Thistle Camps, working on restoration and environmental
projects throughout Scotland. For some 38 years, one very special NTS trip has
been to St Kilda, where volunteers are restoring many of the old cottages that
were deserted so long ago. Scottish Conservation Projects (SCP) is also busy
spring, summer and autumn, drystane diking in East Lothian and Orkney, tree
planting on Rum, controlling erosion on a Roman fort, and much more, Historic
Scotland's similar Action Breaks are also run by SCP, and all these
organisations ask visitors for a small sum towards their keep, very small in
the case of SCP - #5 a day. Information: SCP (also Historic Scotland work)
01786 479 697. NTS: 0131 226 5922.
Historic Scotland has a long list of properties in its charge, many of which
hold special events such as battle re-creations, next year strongly featuring
the 1745/6 Jacobite Rising. Historic Scotland offers seven and 14-day Scottish
Explorer tickets with free entry to 60 properties, including Edinburgh and
Stirling Castles and Fort George (#12 adult, with some concessions), which can
be bought at Historic Scotland Properties, and many tourists centres. Historic
Scotland events list: 0141 668 8686.
Quite apart from its numerous properties, (NTS members free entry) the National
Trust for Scotland has a selection of apartments and cottages in more than 30
places all over Scotland, from a small flat sleeping two in Gladstone's Land in
Edinburgh's Lawnmarket to Thrums Cottage at Kirriemuir, elegant castle flats in
Culzean and Brodick Castles and Castle Fraser to cottages in Threave Estate in
Galloway where the NTS runs beautiful gardens. This is self-catering and many
sleep four or six, while a house on the Isle of Canna can take 10. Prices are
reasonable. Brochure/Bookings, NTS: 0131 243 9331.
Though travel by car is essential for some places, anyone who has seen the
number of summer coaches on the Scottish roads is well aware that this is an
easy, comfortable option, and there are many tours within Scotland, often
starting in Edinburgh or Glasgow. For individual travel, ScotRail has a Freedom
of Scotland travel pass which gives unlimited travel on all scheduled ScotRail
and Strathclyde PTE trains, Glasgow's Underground, scheduled Caledonian
MacBrayne ferries on the Firth of Clyde and the Western Isles (except Raasay
and Scalpay), with Strathclyde PTE included and discounts on other ferry
services, bus and postbus. It even includes discount on entry fees to some
places to visit.
The Freedom of Scotland pass costs #99 for eight consecutive days, #110 for
eight from any 15 consecutive days, and #139 for 15 consecutive days. The more
limited ScotRail Rover (no ferry or bus concessions, some restriction on times)
costs #60 for four out of eight consecutive days, #88 for eight consecutive
days, and #115 for 12 out of 15 consecutive days. There are also Short Breaks
packages and Days Out by Rail. Information Sales: staffed ScotRail stations or

I ONCE spent many rewarding hours in the company of a man whom I regarded as a
true West Coast Scot. His preferred mode of dress was a dark pea jacket, navy
wool rollneck sweater, and a flat cap to thwart the perpetual rain. The
nautical look was a backwash from his years in the Merchant Marine and in rich
men's yachts.
He lived in one of those organic, whitewashed crofts with which mid-Argyll is
dotted and which appear to be growing out of the rock. He could handle a small
boat in a gale as sweetly as a shepherd controls his dog.
Once, after a black night drift-netting in the Kilbrannan Sound, he took a
mackerel from the net, filleted it with a few deft flicks of his seaman's knife
and fried it with butter and salt and pepper before it had properly stopped
twitching. Served in a warm foc'sle with a mug of tea, it tasted heavenly.
I wonder what this courteous, contented, and unostentatiously knowledgeable man
would have made of the recent inhabitants of another whitewashed house on the
West Coast who have announced their presence with a glossy book of Vegan
recipes entitled Rainbows and Wellies, the Taigh Na Mara Cookbook.
Their bubbling enthusiasm is such that they must surely be incomers to the
small guest-house near Ullapool on Loch Broom, from whose menus they take the
evangelically anti-meat recipes.
Certainly one of them arrived, ``a casualty of the stressed-out 90s'', just
last year and it is difficult not to suspect a marketing background, given the
``Och Aye the Noo'' flavour of the names of their dishes.
Bonnie Prince Pudding, Sushi MacHoochie, Ceilidh Cassoulet, MacFungus
Croustard, Hector's Haggis Boats and Culloden Hearts . . . the list goes on,
excruciatingly.
They would doubtless be greeted with thigh-slapping glee by a southern English
coach party, as would the injuction in the first few pages to use the Orgasmic
Chocolate Mousse for sexual purposes.
I am sure the colonial tone of the text - ``the local boys are so good at
keeping our roads clear'' - is unintended. However, the laddish image on the
front cover - a picture of one of the owners standing in Loch Broom naked
except for a bunch of bananas - is straight from the culture of Men Behaving
Badly.
A ceilidh, we are informed, is ``generally perceived to mean a dance or
party''. In the book, ``lassies from Lewis'' ask for the porridge recipes. The
guest-house address is given as ``near Ullapool, Scottish Highlands''.
Many of the meals circumvent the limitations of vegan cooking with imagination
and flair and I can accept that they feel obliged to import tofu, oyster
mushrooms, and Japanese seaweed in favour of the traditional fare of the
district. However, it is difficult to ignore the feeling that they are just
delighted with themselves for indulging in a lifestyle adventure in such an
outlandish place.
Burton Anderson is a writer who has no qualms about exploring a different
culinary culture, in Pleasures of the Italian Table. He has lived in the
country for more than 20 years, writing about wine, food, and travel and has
approached his subject with respect, not to say reverence.
In this discreet and unillustrated volume, he dwells in depth on familiar foods
such a pizza napoletana, witnesses the ritual of pasta being shaped and cut
and, on a foggy morning in Alba, goes in search of the legendary white truffle
in the company of an experienced trifolau and his five dogs.
His style reminds me of the incomparable Margaret Visser and her great culinary
polemic Much Depends on Dinner. He talks in fascinating and informed detail,
adding dashes of history, economics, and politics to the mix, and listening
carefully to the wisdom of the ordinary people who have created extraordinary
food from the bounty of their immediate surroundings.
Junior Masterchef is a book designed to irretrievably dispirit parents with
couch-potato children whose most rigorous activity is changing the computer
game disk.
A spin-off from the highly successful Loyd Grossman TV series, it features
recipes from gifted adolescents who can not only produce dishes such as timbale
of trout and sole in a champagne sauce, but would no doubt dominate the
dinner-table conversation with unanswerable bons mots.
From the Scottish section, for instance, 14-year-old Ross Spence, from
Banchory, not only offers a recipe for chargrilled pave of gravadlax salmon but
lists his hobbies as fishing the Dee, collecting wine labels, and playing
croquet. One can only assume he will grow into burgers on the barbie like the
rest of us.
It was Shirley Conran who observed that ``life's too short to stuff a
mushroom'', and only the most relaxed of the leisured classes would spend their
afternoons creating the recipes in A Passion for Caviare, such as the spinach
parcels stuffed with lemon sole and Sevruga.
However, this beautifully produced and lovingly illustrated book is worth its
price for the little gems scattered throughout. Did you know - and buy yourself
a bottle of champagne if you did - that the Queens's Grill on the QE2 serves
15% of the world's consumption of Beluga? Or that in 1927 Cartier had in their
brochure a small gold ball on a chain for use as a caviare tester? Whenever
caviare was served you dropped the ball into it. If it sank, it was judged
acceptable, but if it stuck in the middle you sent it back.
Along with A Passion for Oysters from the same stable, which is lavish in its
praise of the famously creamy Islay oyster, these would make entertaining
birthday gifts, or simply treat yourself.

THE word ``talent'' infers a volcano of ability, but it needs a support group.
The structure of the life of 14-year-old swimmer Steven Kidd is geared towards
allowing him the chance to reach his goal of Olympic Gold Medallist in the year
2000. His is a story of parental love versus the establishment.
Scotstoun Leisure Centre, run by Glasgow City Council, where Steven is coached,
where he does circuit training, boxercise, step aerobics, weights, and uses the
400m track, doesn't really merit a mention, because it didn't let our
photographer in to snap Steven in their pool for this article. The Herald is
not being churlish. We have it on authority that the Sunday Mail was once let
in, after all.
The fact that a young boy - while some others of his age all over the world are
staring at a computer screen, sniffing glue, drinking, taking their first
ecstasy tablet, or watching nine daily hours of TV - turns up to train in their
pool so that one day he will represent Scotland and Scottish sport, in a major,
international competition, seems to elude council officialdom.
It is commonsense that Steven needs all the publicity he can get. But while
phone-calls inquiring about centre facilities are answered, wires are crossed.
Boys and girls anxious for heros troop in and out the swish complex, already
converted to the benefits of health and competition, already familar with Nike
trainers, Linford Christie and McCoist.
But for Daniel and Isobel Kidd there would be more money to invest in Steven's
future if they stayed outside in their car. For Scotstoun Leisure Centre
contributes to the isolation the Kidds already feel by regularly charging them
admission money. The price of watching Steven in the pool is not much, around
35p per person, but it mounts up, day after day, year after year, decade after
decade.
``But there's no-one else to drive him,'' Isobel explains. The Kidds have no
choice but to be there. If Steven ever wins a Gold Olympic Medal, it will be a
credit to him and his family, not his country.
Steven, a member of the Scottish Junior Swimming Team, swims eight times a
week. He travels from the family home in Bo'ness to Scotstoun, 44 miles there,
and 44 miles back. During a normal day, Steven trains twice, getting up at
4.30am and arriving at the leisure centre at 5.30am. He trains until 7am, then
he's driven home to Bo'ness for 8am, gets his breakfast, and is at school for
9am. At 3.45pm he leaves straight from school to travel once again to Glasgow
for a training session which starts at 5pm and finishes at 7pm. His dad does
the driving, although his Grandpa helps out nights. Aren't you permanently
knackered? I ask Steven.
``It's me that's permanently knackered,'' says his dad. Daniel and Isobel Kidd
turn up at 5am in the morning, and hang around at the pool side for up to three
hours until their son has been coached. As taxpayers the Kidds feel that they
are already paying for the use of the leisure centre, but the council still
feel at liberty to make money from their support. What can you say? This
ignorance and parsimony is an example of a mediocre and lazy Scottish
mentality. A sports centre in Scotland thinks that it's OK to penalise the
parents of a boy who could, one day, be their worldwide and respected
representative.
But Steven is a fighter, and the more he has to face down the better he
becomes. He knows his parents are struggling to put him through his training.
He knows they have to find thousands of pounds per year, and they don't have
high-flying jobs; Isobel works in a hospital and Daniel is a contracts
supervisor.
``I've got an ambition to go the Olympics,'' he tells me. ``Your family have
got to pay for you, and it costs a lot of money to get there. It's hard for
them. They've got a life as well. I just know that it all pays off when you go
into a competition, when you win.''
Indeed. I counted 26 gold medals on Steven's CV, and seven new records. A rough
estimate of expenditure, based on information gleaned from Mr Kidd - ``#62 for
Darlington, #108 for Norway plus spending money, #12 per month coaching fees,
#3.50 a swim, #22 entry fees for each race, #67 for Dunoon training camp, daily
petrol . . .'' - comes to about five, six grand per year.
``Sponsorship in swimming is non-existent,'' he states. ``Steven got a couple
of hundred quid from a guy in Bo'ness who doesn't even know him. I got a phone
call last night from the coach, Steven's got to go to Lanzarote to a
warm-weather training camp, and needs #240 to go, just like that.''
Steven left Grangemouth and Cumbernauld for Scotstoun to be trained by an
Englishman and a New Zealander, because his dad believes that here the coaches
are the best. Coaches are only looking for someone who can do the business, who
can perform.
``There is no doubt that Steven will become a Scottish Senior
Internationalist.'' There aren't any swimmers in the family. Daniel raises his
eyes, mystified to where it has all come from. All he knows is that your
children are bound to you forever, that Steven has to continue training and
that he has to look out for him.
As a child, Steven was wildly energetic, but never a waterbasher, like other
swimmers. He has a liquid technique, he's a dolphin, but without his swimming
he has nothing. Daniel is determined for his son, but he's not the driving
force. You can't have starstruck parents when swimming champions are largely
ignored by the media. Steven knows that winning might bring him anonymity.
``Fraser Walker was second in the world championships. Ask anyone in the street
who Fraser Walker was and they wouldn't know.''
``We've got to pay it and get on with it,'' says Daniel. ``He's come too far
for us to say you'll need to stop swimming, we can't afford it. He can't just
stop. If they've got the talent you've got to give them the chance to do it.''
It really depends on your own state of grace, whether you feel a sense of
patriotism or disdain for a wee worker like Steven Kidd. His current best event
is the 200m backstroke. When I interviewed him, his time was 2.13.13, but it
will now be down to 2.10, if not better. Steven's times are consistent. It's
the only way to progress. Each new level is a platform to knock more seconds
off, and he knows how much time he must lose each year to earn a chance of
winning an Olympic Gold. He worked it out one night, when he was 12-years-old,
allowing for new and better records.
``You need a positive approach,'' says Daniel Kidd. ``If you do 2.13 and your
coach says I want 2.10 next week and you go, `I can't do that,' it's wrong.''
The problem with nature is that it takes its own course. Steven has a technique
which complements his bodyweight and five feet 10 inches of height. But he is
still growing, on a high-fibre diet of pasta, bread, and rice. He can only hope
that his comprehensive training outside the pool has indoctrinated his muscles,
and that he will ``bulk out'' in a beneficial way.
``My coach at Bo'ness said it was a natural technique that I had. Just now,
there are other boys in my age group who are much bigger and stronger than I am
and they are using strength. I haven't got as much strength, so I use technique
- that's what's getting me there.''
``Probably this year and the year after are going to be the most difficult time
for him,'' says his dad, ``to keep his interest in swimming, although he's
never lost any of that interest, and to progress to senior stage by fifteen or
sixteen, and the women, ken . . . ''. At this point Steven's dad bursts into
giggles.
Steven hasn't graduated yet to that male nadir where he begins to take girls
seriously. He is not yet at the mercy of women's hormones. His dad tells me he
thinks Steven's got a girlfriend. ``Ah huvnae!'' Steven insists, getting red
and annoyed. He thinks having a date is an insult, proof that he doesn't have
anything more important to do.
``What about that wee lassie who keeps following you about?'' his dad nudges.
Steven sighs deeply. ``We were at Darlington last week,'' Daniel continues,
``and he was at the hotel. I went down to see him and there were four girls in
the room with him.'' Well, the girls seem to think he's a safe bet. Young,
talented, fit. Yes, the boy's got a tribe of groupies already.
I don't think, however, that he'll go off on a wild spree. Steven's focused.
He's calm. He was the fastest in the junior championships in Leeds this year,
but not without some immediate trouble. A fellow competitor, the boy
representing England, took an emotional crisis on his block. Steven just turned
his back to him and beat him. He has sessions with a sports psychologist, but
he learned this tactic from watching Linford Christie.
``In his race in the Olympics, in the 100m, he usually looks down the track, he
was under pressure, and the guy next to him was looking at him. He just turned
and concentrated on his own race. The guy next to him was destroyed.'' Can
somebody throw you, Steven? ``They can't really, it just makes me more
determined.''
The use of a psychologist sounds ominous. Prodigies feel pressure. It's true.
``According to the coaches, this is him getting groomed for six or seven years'
time, when it comes to a major championship, so that his bottle doesn't go.''
Then, all the nurturing would be wasted.
But Steven believes that the hassle, the expense, and the time will pay off,
because he'll make sure it does. In the Olympic Year 2000, Steven will be 19,
but in 2004 he should be at his peak at 23. He doesn't yet know what his best
stroke will be then. It is unbearable for either Steven, his mum or dad or even
his little sister to think about what might happen if Daniel lost his job, or
Steven was permanently injured. When your whole existence revolves around one
purpose, you have a tenuous link with the idea of failure.
``David Wilkie hit the nail on the head. He said that money from the lottery is
being pumped into building fancy new pools. Glasgow will get three: Tollcross,
Bridgeton, and the Gorbals,'' says Daniel Kidd. ``But, as he reckoned, that's
not how you get Olympic swimmers, you need the sponsorship to take them
through. And companies only sponsor the finished article, the guy who's made
it, that's where the problem is.''
Linford Christie gets #50,000 for turning up for a race. Sponsors pay for their
logo to be paraded on the back of the man or woman to which the TV camera
always turns. Sponsors, unlike parents, will not take a chance on anyone's
future; even though, unlike parents, all they have to do is sign a cheque. But
Steven Kidd will prove the cynics and the fat cats wrong. I think he'll make
it, I think he'll get what he wants.
``You need self-motivation,'' he says, frankly. ``You have to want to do it, to
have that goal.'' But like Wilkie, he won't forget that he had to achieve on
behalf of his country, without its help.
``I'm hoping that when I'm older, I can help somebody else who's younger than
me, and share my experiences'' he says. Ironically, Scotland will not lose its
chance of stardom, because if Steven Kidd doesn't make it, he'll make sure
another Scottish talent does.
n If you or your company are interested in sponsoring Steven Kidd, or you would
like to make a donation, please call Mr Daniel Kidd on 01506 822766.

THE former owner of a haunted Scottish castle now relies on family and friends
to keep him going financially, a court heard yesterday.
Yorkshireman Ian McMillan, 51, used to own the 600-year-old Hallgreen Castle,
near Inverbervie, Kincardineshire, and held the title Baron of Brigfoord.
He and his wife spent thousands of pounds renovating the clifftop fortress and
he had planned to develop a #1.5m theme park there.
However, he ran into money difficulties earlier this year, was declared
bankrupt, and had his assets sequestrated.
Stonehaven Sheriff Court heard yesterday that McMillan now lived in Hull and
was reliant on friends to keep him going.
He admitted a charge of driving a hired car without proper insurance.
The court was told he had not realised the insurance was only in his wife's
name.
The offence happened in May this year, near the entrance to his former castle
home.
His defence solicitor, Mr Dennis Daun, said McMillan had asked his wife if he
was covered to drive the car and she had told him he was.
Mr Daun added: ``He was sequestrated in this court earlier this year and his
financial circumstances are fairly strained, to say the least.
``He now lives in Hull and is relying entirely on friends and family for
assistance and support.
``He is endeavouring to seek work and his best efforts to find employment may
lie abroad,'' said Mr Daun.
Sheriff Robert McCallum fined McMillan, of Ferry Lane, Hull, #150 and banned
him from driving for six months.
Hallgreen Castle is home to a series of ghosts, including green ladies,
mediaeval serving-wenches, and murdered children.
It was put on the market earlier this year for #250,000 pounds - the same as a
traditional granite house in Aberdeen, 25 miles away, would be expected to
fetch.

MIKKI DOYLE, the fiesty former women's editor of the Morning Star, communist
and fighter for women's liberation, died this month aged 79, after a long
illness.
At a ceremony at Putney Crematorium attended by the Marchioness of Lothian and
Ken Gill, former general secretary of MSF, her friends recalled the memory of
an extraordinary woman. Although she was only ``5ft-nothing'' in her stockinged
feet she had a hea
rt as big as her native New York where she met and married her Glasgow-born
soulmate Charlie Doyle who passed away in 1983.
Always refreshingly candid with a wicked sense of humour the chain-smoking
Mikki could hold court for hours over drinks with such amazing tales, they
could have provided the stuff of novels.
Born Miriam Levental to East European parents in the lower east side of
Manhattan in 1916, her communist politics were forged at an early age -
initially by her first husband, an English communist sailor, but essentially by
her experiences surviving the d
epression.
She was renowned for taking her two children on the campaign trail,
demonstrating her support for the Spanish Republic and fighting the judicial
murder of the Rosenbergs.
She met Charlie in 1949 after a second failed marriage. It was just months
after she had lost an eye at a Paul Robeson concert in Peekskill, New York,
when a gang of drunken racists pelted the crowd with stones.
Mikki was forced to marry Charlie by proxy as he was detained awaiting
deportation to Britain during the McCarthyite purges. He was a vice-president
of the Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union and member of the US Communist
Party.
Mikki's account of their exile sounds like a scene from Casablanca. Separated
by the full length of the ship and two burly FBI agents, wee Charlie was only
freed from his handcuffs when they reached international waters.
Typical of her mischievous sense of humour was her response to the strange
request by the US Communist Party for all members to record a list of their
personal relationships.
Rumoured to have been initiated by covert FBI agents, who many believed
outnumbered the real membership of the CPUSA during the cold war, Charlie
adamantly refused to comply.
Not so Mikki. ``I wrote down the name of every male I knew and then some. If I
was to be painted a red harlot, they might as well put me down for f****** them
all.''
In another spectacular confrontation, this time on British television, the
normally trouser-wearing Mikki upstaged the usually ostentatious Barbara
Cartland by tarting herself up in a shocking pink outfit.
On her arrival in Britain in 1953 Mikki became a factory worker and then a
successful copywriter in advertising before spending a short time working for
the Cuban Embassy and then going on to join the Morning Star in 1967.
Charlie went on to become shop stewart in the electricians union and was dubbed
by the Daily Mirror during a strike as the ``most dangerous man in Britain''.
Always ready to put the cat among the pigeons Mikki helped to transform the
Morning Star's women's page into a lively feminist forum and was instrumental
in shaping the emerging women's movement of the 1970s.
She was a founder member of Women in Media, was an active anti-racist
campaigner and was the only Morning Star journalist ever to be invited to
appear on What The Papers Say.
Affectionately dubbed Lady Doyle because of her friendship with the Marchioness
of Lothian, Mikki first met her when she was asked to address a Woman of the
Year luncheon to raise money for the Greater London Fund for the Blind.
When she retired from the Morning Star in 1985, the former editor Tony Chater
praised her contribution to working class politics, saying: ``Mikki is not
retiring, she's just slowing down.''
Mikki never let the side down. Despite having countless operations against
cancer she continued to inspire many younger comrades with her revolutionary
enthusiasm.

Cherkassky: showy and often deliberately wayward.
Shura Cherkassky, pianist; born Odessa, October 7, 1911, died London, December
27, 1995
WITH the death of Ukranian-born pianist Shura Cherkassky at the age of 84, one
of the final links with a great romantic tradition is severed.
Utterly wilful, completely eccentric, and frequently bizarre in his playing
style, Cherkassky sustained his career into old age, celebrating his eightieth
birthday with an international tour. Audiences loved him, purists detested his
waywardness, and crit
ics wandered away from his concerts shell-shocked by his indifference to
convention.
In an age when pianists are churned out by conservatoires, schooled in the
disciplines of absolute correctness and the sublimation of individual whim,
Cherkassky was almost a direct link with an earlier age, when
personality-pianism ruled, high-velocity v
irtuosity triumphed, and the pianistic pyrotechnician was the first genuine
international superstar.
Born in Odessa, and trained initially by his mother, a piano teacher,
Cherkassky emigrated to the United States with his family in 1922. A child
prodigy, he made his debut that year, aged 11, in Baltimore.
His first real contact with the great nineteenth-century tradition came when he
played for the pianist-composer Rachmaninov, who saw the young Cherkassky's
potential, but said he would teach him only if he agreed not to play in public
for two years.
Cherkassky, impatient for the limelight, instead went directly to the Polish
pianist Josef Hofmann, one of the lions of late nineteenth-century pianism,
then teaching at the Curtis Institute at Philadelphia. Hoffman took the
opposite view to Rachmaninov,
saying that Cherkassky must give recitals immediately, accepted him as a
student, and began indoctrinating the youngster into the great romantic
tradition.
By the age of 16, Cherkassky had embarked on his first international tour, a
practice that was to become the habit and passion of a lifetime. From 1945,
when he made his first, extensive, and acclaimed tour of Europe he began a
ceaseless circuit of intern
ational touring that he attacked with a rare relish and that was to last almost
half a century until his death.
He became famed for his exuberant performances of the great romantic piano
concertos of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Chopin, Liszt, and Schumann. Unlike many
others, he never eschewed new developments, tirelessly absorbing new
compositions by composers as av
ant-garde as Berio and Stockhausen.
The dapper little pianist was famed - and notorious - for his complex and
ambiguous behaviour. In his preparation and practice he was meticulous and
prissy. But only to a degree - four hours a day precisely he practised; not a
minute more or less.
Every year he abandoned his strict regime for two months, when he would travel
somewhere hot and, in his own words: ``Lie in the blazing sun doing nothing
until my fingers are stiff like iron.''
His eccentric inflexibility and obsessiveness with detail spilled into his
personal life. He would insist on two copies of the programme for each of his
concerts being placed on the table in the artist's dressing room. And, at
another extreme, he would sp
ecify the number of sheets of toilet paper to be made available in the
dressing-room lavatory.
Not surprisingly, with such bizarre behaviour, his one marriage was
short-lived. He admitted himself that the reason for his wife divorcing him was
``mental cruelty''.
Following the break-up of his marriage, he lived with his mother in Nice, until
her death in 1961. Thereafter, he moved to London and - for the last 17 years
of his life - lived in a cluttered hotel room at The White House in Regent's
Park, surrounded by
his books, clothes, and CDs and the airline timetable which was, he said, his
bible.
Despite all of Cherkassky
's obsessiveness with precision - and he confessed freely that he was extremely
difficult to tolerate - when he played, he would be showy and often
deliberately wayward. ``I must admit,'' he once said, ``that I will always play
how I feel on the spur of t
he moment.''
He drove conductors and orchestras mad by rehearsing a work in a particular
way, then, without warning, going off in a completely different direction
during the performance. Though many found this an endearing and rather romantic
trait, it could be comple
tely ruinous to a performance.
At his last appearances in Scotland, three years ago, when he toured with the
BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Cherkassky, as neat and dapper a figure as
ever, went totally off the rails.
Playing Gershwin's Piano Concerto he introduced an unwritten rhythm section by
stamping his feet throughout, and in a completely unpredictable version of
Beethoven's Emperor Concerto, defying any known convention of style, he at once
reinvented the piece
and repeatedly charged ahead, leaving the conductor and orchestra miles behind
and racing to catch up.
As ever, despite leaving a technical shambles in his wake, the charming little
shocker secured a rapturous reception from his audiences. More anarchist than
romantic, Cherkassky left his mark wherever he played.

Brussels, Friday
A BRITISH former church minister accused of publishing international guides for
child molesters has died before standing trial in Belgium.
John Stamford, 56, was scheduled to answer charges brought by children's rights
groups alleging that he provided information on child prostitutes to
paedophiles around the world.
Belgian media and sources involved in the case said Stamford died on Wednesday
of a heart attack in hospital near his home in northern Belgium.
``His death will probably mean the end of all judicial action. We regret it
because we wanted to make an example of him,'' said Bernard Boeton of Land of
Mankind, one of the groups pressing charges.
Stamford, a former Sunday school teacher from St Helens on Merseyside, denied
child sex charges and claimed to be the victim of an anti-homosexual campaign.
News reports claim that the former policeman's son ran an organisation that
dispatched paedophile information to more than 25,000 customers.
He allegedly recommended that clients visit Third World countries where
children could be ``hired'' for a can of Coke.
Prosecutors say Stamford used a homosexual travel guide called Spartacus as a
front for a mailing service offering information on child prostitution in
Thailand, Brazil, the Philippines, and other nations. In April, a court in
Turnhout ruled that he shoul
d face a jury on charges of offending public morals and publicising sexual
exploitation.-AP.

THE final steps on the road to Superbowl XXX will be initiated this weekend as
the NFL's post-season play-offs get under way with the first round of the
knock-out stages.
Wild-card teams Miami Dolphins, Indianapolis Colts, San Diego Chargers, Detroit
Lions, Atlanta Falcons, NFC Central champions Green Bay Packers and AFC East
conquerors Buffalo Bills will battle to fill four berths among the last eight
in next weekend's di
visional play-off games.
Up for grabs for the AFC teams is a divisional play-off visit to either
Pittsburgh Steelers or Kansas City Chiefs, while the NFC survivors will face a
trip to either Dallas Cowboys or San Francisco 49ers, who all received byes to
the divisional stage due
to their superior regular season records.
The Dolphins, more used to the tropical climes of sunny Florida, travel to
freezing Buffalo today to take on the Bills in a rivalry as bitter as the
weather in up-State New York.
Led by record-breaking quarterback Dan Marino, Miami are playing for more than
a trip to the Superbowl in Arizona. Unbelievably, after 25 years in charge,
head coach Don Shula's previously unassailable position is under threat.
In the NFC a battle of running backs will ensue when Philadelphia Eagles and
their ground attack specialist Ricky Watters host resurgent Detroit Lions, who
boast one of the NFL's most potent rushing threats in Barry Sanders.
NFL play-offs round 1 fixtures;
Today: AFC - Miami Dolphins at Buffalo Bills (KO 5pm GMT); NFC - Detroit Lions
at Philadelphia Eagles (9pm GMT).
Tomorrow: NFC - Atlanta Falcons at Green Bay Packers (5pm GMT); AFC -
Indianapolis Colts at San Diego Chargers (9pm GMT).

Archibald Gillespie, director of finance, Strathclyde Regional Council; born
September 4, 1935, died December 25, 1995
WITH the death of Archie Gillespie on Christmas Day, I have lost a trusted
friend as well as a director of finance. The relationship between a committee
chair and director has to be special, with respect and trust on both sides. I
worked closely with Arch
ie for the past eight years, and we certainly had that kind of relationship.
He was a wise counsellor, always there to give a considered response whenever
it was asked for. When he felt strongly about something he would stick to his
own view, as the Scottish Office and Secretary of State - and members of his
own council - have fou
nd to their cost.
He was never an easy touch, and was noted for his tenacity and his integrity.
Last year, when discussing the problems of capping with Ian Lang and Allan
Stewart, he pointed out that the only way to make savings was redundancies -
``and that won't save mon
ey, but cost us more''.
A big man in every way, Archie had worked his way up from Greenock Corporation
through Bute County Council to Strathclyde, where he controlled a budget of
over #3bn, more than that of many independent states.
Although he served his apprenticeship in the private sector (with Ritchie and
Holmes in Greenock), he was one of the old-style council officials who firmly
believed in public services and their need to be funded properly.
As the director responsible for the collection of local taxes, he had no doubt
about the duty of citizens to pay their way. He was constantly concerned about
collection of rates, and the effect the Poll Tax had on public attitudes to the
payment of local
taxes.
He had, however, the knack of switching off when he left the office, and
enjoying life with his family, or on the golf course. One of his great passions
was Greenock Morton: just a few days ago he was discussing the team's progress
with me, and expressing
his doubts about how the Dutch-style football they were playing could
withstand the Scottish weather. He loved football, and enjoyed nothing more
than going to Cappielow, watching the game, then heading to the golf club with
friends.
He was quite a wit. When we had to take some difficult decisions on collection
of poll tax by arresting student grants, he ended a stormy meeting with the
remark: ``That's it gone, my chance of being elected rector of one of our
universities!''
I'd known Archie since I came to the council in 1982. At that time I lived in
Gourock, where he was an elder of the Kirk and a well known figure in
Inverclyde district. He very much enjoyed his appointments as a commissioner
for the Public Works Loans Boa
rd, and treasurer for Loch Lomond Park.
We had all hoped that he would enter retirement and have the chance to give
more of his special talents to the wider community. This was not to be, and our
hearts go out to his widow, Alice, and the children, Linda, Christina, Duncan
and Kenny.
n.Appreciation by Councillor JOHN MULLIN, chair, finance committee, Strathclyde
Regional Council.

A BABY boy died of meningitis hours after being sent home from a hospital
casualty unit late at night, it was disclosed yesterday.
Five-week-old Ryan Smith from Londonderry's Creggan district was later
confirmed to have had meningococcal meningitis.
His mother, Wendy, first became worried about Ryan on the evening of the
Thursday before Christmas and called out her GP, who examined him and said he
might have meningitis.
With her boyfriend Paul Boreland, she took the baby immediately to Altnagelvin
hospital, where a doctor told her to go home and return next day if the baby's
condition did not improve.
The baby died in bed beside his mother about 7am the next day.
A coroner's inquiry is to be held but the hospital said it does not plan an
internal inquiry.

MILLIONS of us are busy making resolutions at this time of the year, but how
many of us ever turn words into actions? Well, that all depends on whether
you're a shaker, a breaker, a maker or a faker, according to some New Year
research by IFA Promotion.
Shakers make really bold decisions, but the proposed changes are so dramatic
they fail to do anything at all. The solution? Set realistic goals - the more
manageable your New Year resolutions the better your chances of achieving them.
Breakers believe that if one bad habit vanishes, the rest will soon follow -
but they tend to give up after a few days or weeks. The solution? Try to break
only one bad habit at a time - and note when and where you slip back into your
old ways.
Makers are most likely to stick to their guns. They plan well and focus on
greater personal, professional and financial achievements - don't you just hate
them!
Fakers, meanwhile, produce the longest list of resolutions, but keep them for
the shortest time. The solution? Make just one realistic resolution that will
improve your life or help those around you.
In the aftermath of Christmas many people will be looking for ways to increase
their income, cut back on expenditure or simply make financial life easier for
themselves and their families. So here are a handful of ideas that may help to
make your 1996 mor
e prosperous.
n Switching your bank account could save you as much as #100 a year and give
you a better level of service. Top accolades in a recent Which? magazine survey
of customer satisfaction went to the Royal Bank of Scotland and First Direct.
Many of us don't switch banks because we think they are all the same - not true
- and that there's a lot of work involved. But many banks have special
switchers' packs to ease the move, so get cracking.
n Thousands of people move home each year, leaving millions of pounds behind -
not hidden under the floorboards, but left in savings accounts, premium bonds,
insurance companies and other investments.
Without an up-to-date address dividends cannot be sent, Ernie cannot pay out
premium bond prizes and the proceeds of insurance policies remain in the
companies' coffers. Building society savers who don't pass on their new address
can't be told about impen
ding takeovers either and may miss out on valuable free shares or cash bonuses.
So it's time to sort through all your policies, passbooks and investment papers
and make sure every organisation which has some of your money knows where you
are.
n Could there be a long lost pension waiting for you somewhere? If you worked
for an employer many years ago and left behind benefits in a scheme now is the
time to track them down. The company may have changed its name, moved or been
taken over, but the
Pension Schemes Registry can help to find where your benefits are now.
Write to the Registry at PO Box 1NN, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE99 1NN. You'll be
sent a form to fill in and asked to give as much information as possible about
your old scheme and employer. With luck it will be able to come up with an
address where you can w
rite to collect your pension from long ago.
n More pension cash could be waiting for anyone who has been employed in the
construction industry since 1982. If you were directly employed in the industry
and received ``holiday stamps'', get in touch with the Building and Civil
Engineering Benefit Sche
mes (B&amp;CE). You could be in line for the tax-free lump sum paid out to workers
when they retire at age 65. To be eligible you need to have had 80 weeks of
service between April 1982 and your retirement date.
To find out if you might qualify phone B&amp;CE for the cost of a local call on
0345 414142 - the lines re-open for claims on Wednesday, January 3.
n If you took out term insurance in 1990-91, you could cut your premiums by a
third by switching to another company. Premiums for term life insurance peaked
in 1991 as the insurance industry agonised over the potential effects of Aids.
But premiums have c
ome down again in recent months and you can benefit from cuts by cancelling
your old policy and starting a new one.
A word of warning - don't opt out of your existing policy until you've been
accepted by a new company. Also, make sure the new one gives as good or better
cover.
Term insurance simply guarantees to pay a fixed amount if you die within the
term of the policy - say, between five and 25 years. There is no surrender
value, which is why you may have nothing to lose by cashing in and starting
another plan. Don't try the
same trick with investment-type policies such as endowments though as there
are big financial penalties if you stop these early.
n Consider using the savings you make to add critical illness cover to your
range of insurance. Traditional policies pay up when you die. But you might not
have heard of the newer critical illness cover. This gives you and your family
a lump sum as soon a
s a serious medical problem is diagnosed. This could be used to pay off a
mortgage, provide specialist nursing care - or even to fund a round-the-world
trip if, like thousands of people each year, you recover.
Serious illnesses covered include most cancers, heart attacks, strokes,
multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers, kidney failure and heart bypass surgery. The
typical cost for a 40-year-old man of buying #50,000 of critical illness cover
would be just in excess of
#20 a month. But before you take out a policy, always seek expert advice from
an independent financial adviser.

<HEADLINE>Border moves to replace Bragg</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974635118</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BORDER Television chief executive James Graham will also assume the role of
chairman, following the decision by South Bank Show producer and editor Melvyn
Bragg to relinquish the position.
When it was announced at the beginning of this month that Mr Bragg was to step
down as chairman at Easter but remain a non-executive director, finance
director Peter Brownlow did not anticipate that the appointment of a new
chairman would be considered un
til the Carlisle-based company's next board meeting in early February.
However, Border has obviously decided to move swiftly to appoint a successor to
Mr Bragg from within. No-one at the company was available for comment yesterday.
Concrete sale
CONSTRUCTION firm Costain has sold its concrete products business to Tarmac for
#3.6m. Under the terms of the sale, Costain will retain the company and a small
number of projects which are completed or near completion. It will also retain
and recover the
book debts of the business. Work in progress and debtors retained are estimated
to be worth #8.5m. Tarmac will assume the trade creditors of the business which
amount to around #6.9m.
Name change
NORTH West Water is changing its name to United Utilities from January 1,
following its recent takeover of the Norweb regional electricity company.
Timber profits
TIMBER manufacturer Allan Brothers of Berwick has announced record profits for
the past year of #1m, compared with a #750,000 surplus the previous year and a
deficit in 1993 of #250,000, before being taken over by the John Carr Group.
Cash flows
ROYAL Bank of Scotland experienced its busiest day for cash withdrawals on the
Friday before Christmas, with more than #26m taken out by customers. It
believes its Cashline network will notch up a new monthly record during
December, with withdrawals expec
ted to exceed #400m.

I SEE Dean Richards got a wee award in the honours list. Well done, Dean, and
shiver my fibrillating left ventricle, but you deserve it old boy.
You know, it's about now that I should enter into my hate-the-English mode and
start to slag them off and call them all manner of things, but entirely in
keeping with the spirit of Christmas and forgiveness, ever in touch with the
sentiments of a New Year
, I just can't do it. Not this year any how.
The English wear a white jersey, which is a sure-fire sign of the purity of
their lovely country. Their system of law and order has been copied all over
the world for its fairness and simplicity.
Gary Lineker is English, as is Frank Bruno. I actually like the English as a
race. As a wee boy in Malaya, I was surrounded by lots of little English lads
and I quickly learned that beating them on the rugby pitch was a good way to
annoy them, and it didn
't matter that these rugby games were the only way to let rubber planters' boys
living in a boarding school on the top of an island off the coast of Penang let
off steam, because we all loved it. What the heck, these were my friends.
Take Brian Moore, for instance. The only reason he has a pathological hatred of
Scots is that he has an even bigger inferiority complex than us north of the
Border. The boy acts like a Scotsman in that he is so flaming blinkered and
one-eyed that we are i
nsanely jealous that he's capable of doing unto us what we have done to the
English for decades now - wind us up.
What a cheek he has to use our tactics, which often include talking utter
nonsense to inflame a situation, to annoy us. Take it from me that we have no
viable historical reason to despise them so, because it's years since they came
over the hills in John
Jeffrey's neck of the woods and took all the sheep for their own purposes.
You must have that hate of a neighbour to make it really work, of course, and
it suits us fine, doesn't it? Not only is their dammed country bigger but
they're richer and healthier as a race. Their rugby team is better.
So's the football side, which is miles better, actually. The Queen lives there
and only rarely visits Holyrood Palace.
So you have to pity the English. There they sit, in the sunnier bit of our
island system, looking wearily north at a bunch of miscreants. Yes, we Scots,
who are out to cause trouble and complain until the world ends. We mump if they
beat us, we gloat like
ignorant little children if we duff them, and we talk all the time about
wanting to be a separate country.
Perhaps it's got to a stage in our relationship with our big cousins south of
the Border for us to re-think what we do. The off-field battle is as important,
remember, as the on-field one.
Could it be that our years of niggling away at the English, calling them this
name and then that, have turned events full circle so that the pressure is now
on us? Is Brian Moore and his hate of the Scots a sign that we have lost the
tactical high ground?
Is it a coincidence that Dean Richards gets a wee award and no Scotsman does?
Is it now time to try to understand our persecuted neighbours?
Look at it from their point of view. No-one in the world likes the English, and
therefore, what must it be like for them to have their nearest neighbours
against them instead of acting in support?
I have a novel solution. Let us make it our New Year's resolution to like the
English, and admire them. For they are indeed admirable. Look, I'm only joking.
I hate them too.

LORD Wakeham, former leader of the Conservatives in both Houses of Parliament,
is to become the new chairman of the British Horseracing Board.
After less than a year as a director of racing's governing body, he has been
appointed to succeed Lord Hartington, whose term of office ends next June.
His experience in business and politics - he was also a racehorse owner with
Stan Mellor in the 1970s - marked him out as a potential chairman once he had

AS you await the bells to ring in the new year tomorrow night and you reflect
on what 1996 might bring, just consider this. We are officially living in the
country with the most dynamic economy in Europe. I am not going to predict the
creation of more job
s, continuing strong exports, higher disposable incomes, rising capital
expenditure, lower interest rates and higher growth. The independent
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has done that already.
However, you might ponder the fact that of Europe's elite top ten companies,
four are British. This is more than any other country, the Swiss being next
with three, poor old Germany with only two, and the Netherlands with one.
If you think that is a quirk how about this? Of the 25 best-performing shares
in Europe, an astonishing 15 are for British companies. (The French,
incidentally, don't figure in either grouping although they do have five major
firms with the worst performi
ng shares in Europe.)
Okay, but what does that mean in translation? Well, if Pierre, Jose or Hans
want to salt away some cash in anticipation of the proverbial rainy day, they
will be looking no further than UK stocks. And as many of the high performers
are in the financial se
ctor this is splendid news for Scotland.
If that's the case, you may ask, then why don't you feel good? You will. All
these indicators point in that direction. Your job should be safer. The housing
market should finally pick up. And you should certainly have more cash in your
pocket. After one o
f the worst recessions in modern times this will be some achievement.
The reason why Britain has emerged as leader of the pack is thanks to that most
remarkable of decades, the eighties, which is to be the subject of a major
documentary series on the BBC beginning next month.
I feel it is still too soon to stand back and fully appreciate what happened in
these years and what the long-term effects will be, but the period has been so
traduced a pre-emptive strike is needed.
There have been attempts to dismiss it as the ``me'' or the ``greedy'' decade.
In fact, the eighties was the most important decade for Britain this century.
It represented a watershed when Britain finally shrugged off a near century of
decline, buried the
``British disease'' of the sixties and seventies which had made us the Sick
Man of Europe, and instilled a self-confidence not seen since the days of
Victoria. So revolutionary was it that it radically transformed the political
landscape and, ironically,
the biggest beneficiaries have been Tony Blair and New Labour.
Mrs Thatcher stirred up so many extreme emotions, idolatry or hatred, that the
message of the eighties has often been confused with the messenger. It has
always amused me that socialists speak highly of Lord Home, the product of a
privileged class which p
resided so long over the genteel decay of Britain, but disparagingly of a
clever grocer's daughter who strove to reverse it. Yet it was Mrs Thatcher who
attempted to create a classless Britain by assaulting the cosy Oxbridge liberal
establishment and the
closed shops in medicine, law and the civil service.
The ``yuppy'' in the City and Essex Man in the gentrified villages of southern
England was indeed vulgar with ostentatious spending habits, flashy cars and
brash attitudes, but these were invariably the aspirational sons and daughters
of working class fam
ilies, the very people Labour used to tell us were the salt of the earth.
Mrs Thatcher failed to permanently change attitudes - it was not possible to do
so in the space of only 10 years. What she did achieve, however, was the
systematic burial of the trade unions and the birth of privatisation, both have
invigorated the econom
y. The tradeunions had been living on borrowed time. One of the best books this
year was Correlli Barnett's The Lost Victory, which examined why Britain
underperformed economically after the war. Among the fascinating wealth of
detail are the passages con
cerning the trades unions who put themselves first even when the nation was
fighting for its survival. ``The particular symptoms of the British disease
which was to become so notorious are bluntly documented in the war years of the
1940s by field investig
ations into various industries and tabulated in strike charts kept by the
Ministry of Labour and National Service,'' he writes.
``More working days were lost through strikes every year from 1942 to 1945 than
in 1938, the last full year of peacetime. Coal was far and away the worst
offender with no fewer than 1.2m man-days and 2m tons of coal lost in the first
quarter of 1944 alone
. Usually a coal strike was about wages which really meant a miner's place in
the industrial pecking order. But one local strike during the Normandy invasion
year of 1944, costing 1000 tons of production, took place simply because the
miners wanted to get
rid of the canteen lady.''
Mr Barnett also records how ``who does what'' disputes and stoppages abounded
in the shipyards at the very time Britian stood in desperate danger of losing
the Battle of the Atlantic for want of new warships and merchant vessels to
replace those sunk by t
he U-boats. He notes that the ``unrelenting pursuit of such absurdities were
worthy of the weird land of nonsense visited by Gulliver.''
Politicians of both parties tolerated this for 30 more years before Mrs
Thatcher in the eighties swept away the Lilliputian fantasy and at the same
time severed the cords of nationalisation which bound so much of British
industry. Apart from the error of
joining the ERM, which aggravated the effects of the recession, this new-found
industrial and labour flexibility set the pattern for Europe and catapulted
former state firms like BT into the forefront of private European companies.
It is for these reasons, rather than the ephemera of the ``loadsamoney''
culture that Britain is now in pole position. Happy new year.

MISSING French teenager Celine Figard has been found dead in a lay-by.
Police confirmed last night that a naked body found by a motorist near
Worcester at lunchtime was that of the 19-year-old student, who vanished 10
days ago from a motorway service area near the M4 at Chieveley in Berkshire.
She was formally identified by her 24-year-old cousin Jean-Marc Figard, who had
travelled from a hotel in the New Forest where he works as head waiter.
Celine had been on her way to spend Christmas with him when she disappeared.
Home Office pathologist Dr Peter Ackland carried out a post-mortem examination
in Worcester yesterday afternoon but the cause of death has not been released.
It is understood there were no major injuries on the body of teenager.
Police forces throughout Britain had been on the alert for Celine, who was last
seen apparently getting a lift from the ginger-haired driver of a white
Mercedes lorry cab at the Granada Service Station on the A34, near Newbury.
She hitched her way from her home on a farm in the village of
Ferrieres-Les-Scey, south east of Paris, by lorry as travel was difficult in
France because of numerous strikes.
A nationwide manhunt is under way in a bid to track down the mystery driver,
who is said to be aged 30 to 35 and with a ginger chin-strap beard.
Celine's body was discovered at lunchtime yesterday when a motorist stopped to
examine a faulty windscreen wiper near the hamlet of Hadley.
As he stepped from his car he looked over the fence of the lay-by and spotted
the naked body lying in a dip of land close to the fence, but sheltered by a
small copse.
Officers from Hampshire Police drove Celine's cousin to the West Mercia Police
headquarters at Hindlip Hall, near Worcester.
Earlier this week her farmer father Bernard made an emotional appeal on British
television for the safe return of his daughter.
.q.THE 19-year-old victim of a savage attack vowed yesterday that it would not
ruin her life.
Ms Louise Laight was set upon after becoming separated from friends during a
Christmas Eve night out in Chester-le-Street, County Durham.
Her dress was torn off, she was dragged through a garden, suffering deep
scratches from thorn bushes, and punches to her face left her with two black
eyes and a cut lip.
As detectives hunted her attacker, Louise said: ``I wanted to come forward in
public to show that I have nothing to be ashamed of and that I will not let
this incident ruin my life.
``The attack has not just left me physically hurt, but has left me with mental
scars as well.
``I had been looking forward to Christmas and never dreamed anything like this
could happen to me in a place I knew so well.
Louise, who urged anyone who could help police catch the man responsible to
contact them, said she could remember very little about the incident.
``It has made me very nervous about going out, and I know for sure it will take
me a long time to put this fully behind me.''
Detective Inspector Neil Redhead, leading the inquiry, said: ``This assault
left me sickened and was one of the worst of its kind I've come across.
``Obviously, with New Year's Eve coming up, I am concerned that the man who did
this remains at large.
``The last thing I want to do is to scare people, but it is a fact there will
be lots of young people out and about in Chester-le-Street trying to have a
good time just as Louise was last Sunday.''
He urged the man's friends, particularly those with him outside the Red Lion
pub last Sunday night, ``to examine their consciences''.

A USER'S GUIDE TO THE MILLENNIUM: Essays and Reviews
J G Ballard
HarperCollins, #18
THE 1984 novel by J G Ballard, Empire of the Sun - the book of the film by
Steven Spielberg - has an obvious pun in the title. Empire of the Sun depicts
the world as seen by Jim, son of English immigrants to Shanghai.
A son with Anglo-Saxon attitudes to the Chinese inhabitants of Shanghai is
forever altered by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 as he ends up in
a civilian prison camp. Sunny Jim is transformed into a son of several empires
- English, American,
Japanese, Chinese. He has sympathy for them all.
He honours the English, hopes for help from the Americans, admires the audacity
of the Japanese, sadly stares at the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers: ``In the
trenches between the burial mounds hundreds of dead soldiers sat side by side
with their heads a
gainst the torn earth, as if they had fallen asleep together in a deep dream of
war.''
As a writer of fiction - including the science fiction that first made his name
as a writer - Ballard spreads his sympathies like Jim. In this collection of
his essays and reviews, Ballard is as sunny as Jim. Sympathetic to one and all.
Born in Shanghai G
eneral Hospital in 1930, Jim Ballard was impressed when Japanese forces invaded
China in 1937. As he explains in an essay in autobiography: ``As I moved
through the checkpoints I was even more drawn to the Japanese soldiers.
``Many were ruthlessly brutal to the Chinese farmers and rickshaw coolies (yet)
I knew that the Japanese soldiers were brave, and I hoped the British tommies
would never have to fight them. But the Japanese had a strain of melancholy
that I admired, a qua
lity not much in evidence among the party-going Europeans and Americans whom my
parents knew.''
After Pearl Harbor he was placed in Lunghua Camp, to the south of Shanghai, and
(astonishingly) enjoyed the experience: ``Once the 2000 internees had settled
in, life in Lunghua was dominated by the overheated summers and freezing
winters, by stench, nois
e, and boredom. I was enthralled.''
He played games with Japanese prison guards, and continued to look on Lunghua
as his real home when liberated and sent back to Shanghai. As a famous writer
he returned to Lunghua in 1992 and knew ``this was where I had been happiest
and most at home, desp
ite being a prisoner living under the threat of an early death''. Being nice is
second nature to Ballard.
As a reviewer he manages to be nice even when he is inclined to be nasty.
Discussing Richard Schickel's biography of Marlon Brando (1991), Ballard begins
by ridiculing the actor as one who trivialised his talent by agreeing to appear
in poor films for ric
h fees. Then he pays tribute to Brando on account of his performance in Last
Tango in Paris - ``in no sense a pornographic film, but a stunning portrait of
male middle-aged despair, in which he wrote a large part of his own dialogue''.
So, after all, Bran
do is a great actor for Ballard who is, above all, a fan.
A fan of Elvis, despite the great entertainer's decline into overeating and
drug-addiction. Reviewing Albert Goldman's autobiography
character-assassination of Elvis in 1981, Ballard begins by repeating all the
vicious rumours about a man who allegedly be
came a maniac. Yet, Ballard observes, Elvis was ``an enormous talent, and an
influence on popular culture greater than that of any other musical performer
of this century''. Ballard believes a man should be judged on his best work,
not his worst.
He has a good word for Mao as one who enabled millions of Chinese to express
emotion. A good word for Hirohito as an emperor determined to save what was
left of Japan after the dropping of the A-bombs. A good word for Hitler as a
man at the mercy of his o
wn ignorance: ``Hitler was one of the rightful inheritors of the twentieth
century - the epitome of the half-educated man''. Similarly, Charles Manson and
Gary Gilmore are observed as fascinating figures, given ``the remarkable
talents these rootless and
half-educated men (manifested) for manipulating the mass media''. So much
nonsense in the name of entertaining copy.
The title essay of this collection has Ballard waxing lyrical on his favourite
sci-fi films, again making the nasty sound nice. Alien (1979), a truly
repulsive and gratuitously violent movie, is enthusiastically admired as ``an
extremely elegant s-f film'
'. How anyone can see this stomach-churning spectacle as elegant is beyond
belief unless you believe, with Ballard, in moral relativism.
Ballard mentions moral relativism in a review of 1993 of two books on Einstein.
Rejecting criticisms of Einstein as a genius who also managed to be a jerk -
rumours of a visit to a Berlin brothel, speculation that he had sired a number
of illegitimate chi
ldren - Ballard writes that ``none of these revelations lessens one's
respect''. In a world of moral relativism, behaving badly means nothing
compared to the fame of the name noticed by Ballard.
As Ballard, for all his fame as a name in the world of science fiction,
confesses he has never understood what Einstein was on about intellectually,
let me enlighten him by boldly breaking into verse on the subject of Einstein's
Special Theory of Relativity:
According to Einstein
There's no still centre of the
universe:
Everything is moving
Relative to something else.
My love, I move myself towards you,
Measure my motion
In relation to yours.
According to Einstein
The mass of a moving body
Exceeds its mass
When standing still.
My love, in moving
Through you
I feel my mass increase.
According to Einstein
The length of a moving body
Diminishes
As speed increases.
My love, after accelerating
Inside you
I spectacularly shrink.
According to Einstein
Time slows down
As we approach
The speed of light.
My love, as we approach
The speed of light
Time is standing still.
I prefer the moving relativity of Einstein to the moral relativism of Ballard
but appreciate the latter as a fine aphorist (``the great appeal of alcoholism
. . . is that it provides an opportunity for honourable and even heroic
failure'') and one of the
finest apologists for his troubled time. Relatively speaking.

ETHICAL investment may sound a bit dull. And the concept of ``going green'' was
dismissed by some fund managers as irrelevant to investing when it emerged in
the UK 11 years ago. But ethically run investment funds are now reckoned to add
up to an impressi
ve #1000m or thereabouts.
Clearly the concept has caught the imagination of a sizeable number of
investors, even if #1000m is only a tiny fraction of total investment values
and an even smaller percentage of overall funds than in the US.
Conscience and money, which have seldom been obvious partners, have managed to
produce some pretty good results. The 1995 stock market year, for instance,
ended with an impressive flourish for shares in a number of the ``baby bio''
companies working to di
scover cures for a range of problems from cancer downwards as investors placed
bets on hopes of profitable breakthroughs.
Savers can now choose from 30 funds concentrating on the broad field of social,
health or environmentally friendly concepts. One of the most successful at the
moment is the Framlington Health Unit Trust. This has been run by Antony
Milford since it was st
arted in 1987 and in the last five years has quadrupled investors' capital.
The fund is still a small one, adding up to approximately #15m. Much of the
growth came this year - its 1994 low point was 114.5p but it ended 1995 more
than 100p higher.
Although run within ethical guidelines, it is more specialised than most funds
of this type, which can mean it can be more volatile. Its stated aim is to seek
capital growth through investment in health care and medical services and
product companies worl
dwide. Investment includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are in
great favour with investors at the moment, and more than three-quarters of its
money is invested in the US with the UK coming second.
Friends Provident, which was the first to launch an ethical fund - its
Stewardship Unit Trust - in the UK back in 1984, claims around half of the UK
funds under management. But it is now mounting a campaign to convert more
investors.
``Investment in the care market is increasing and we think there is great
potential,'' a spokesman says. ``People are becoming much more aware. This was
shown when people sold Shell shares when the company refused to pull out of
Nigeria after the executio
ns there. But we do need to sell the concept and show that investment does give
long-term performance. Ethical investment is a success story waiting to be
discovered.''
The Stewardship life and pension funds have, in fact, out-performed a fair
number of non-ethical rivals. The company says that a recent survey showed that
four out of five people had not heard about ethical investment but ``millions
would consider investi
ng in such funds if they knew about them''. As many as 60% of those questioned
said that they would prefer to invest in a unit trust that was run on ethical
lines.
The company maintains financial advisors should ask people about their ethical
concerns when discussing their financial needs. Otherwise pacifists might find
themselves investing in companies involved in the arms trade, non-smokers in
tobacco companies, a
nd vegetarians in factory farming.
When ethical investment started it was mainly based on negatives - the funds
avoided companies involved in certain activities and also shunned countries
such as South Africa during the apartheid regime.
Now the ethical funds are increasingly adopting positive criteria and looking
for companies making a helpful contribution to the environment, involved in
medical research or aiding development of the Third World. Funds which once
banned South Africa might
now be keen on supporting it.
The CIS Environ Trust run by a subsidiary of the Co-operative Insurance
Society, for example, says it ``aims to provide capital growth by investing in
the shares of companies which are active in improving the environment, human
health and safety''.
Launched in 1990 it has more than doubled investors' money in five years and in
one performance table using Micropal figures features as second after
Framlington Health. Others with gains of more than 80% in the five years
include Eagle Star Environmental
, Credit Swisse Fellowship, Abbey Ethical, Friends Provident Stewardship and
TSB Environmental.
A large number of companies in the FTSE-100 share index would fail for one
reason or another to qualify for inclusion in an ethical fund. They are usually
so big and diverse that a subsidiary somewhere could well be doing something
that breaches the ``rul
es''.
Looking further, it is estimated that some 60% of the companies in the
All-Share index would also be ruled out. When it launched its first fund
Friends Provident argued that this could be a good thing for investors as it
meant fund managers, having a much
more restricted list of approved investments, would have to research each
company more thoroughly than might otherwise be the case.
This may or may not be a valid point, but it is clear most of the companies
qualifying for consideration are medium or small ones. That usually means their
share prices will be more volatile than those of the giants, but as a trade off
for that they can g
row a lot faster than the really big ones.
Deciding whether a company is ``ethical'' or not is often carried out with the
help of research from EIRIS - the Ethical Investment Research Service. Each
fund has its own criteria and many use EIRIS research to decide whether or not
a company meets them.
EIRIS (0171 735 1351) does not itself give investment advice but individual
investors can buy research material from it to do their own screening. It will
also supply a list of independent financial advisors able to give specialist
advice on ethical inves
ting.
December has seen the Mid-250 index of ``second line'' companies hit a new
record, and with many pundits predicting that 1996 will be another positive
year, ``going green'' should be good for the pocket as well as the conscience -
at least for a while.

SCOTLAND'S top 10 are seeking a special meeting of all clubs in membership of
the Scottish Rugby Union so that the issue of clubs or districts in next
season's European Cup tournament can be more fully aired.
The request, which was due to be discussed at the SRU general committee last
night, follows a meeting of the clubs on Thursday in Edinburgh. The SRU
declared that a decision on whether or not to accede would be made within the
next few days.
It also emerged at yesterday's Murrayfield press briefing that the union's
preferred route is for European participation by three recognised district
sides and not by ``hybrid'' teams - a concept which has also been under
discussion. Which sides will be d
ecided soon, with performances over the past four or five seasons taken into
account.
``The Top Ten,'' as this latest grouping of clubs is now known, had the option
to call for an extraordinary meeting of the union, at which the six in favour
of club participation in Europe - Melrose, Stirling County, Boroughmuir,
Watsonians, Edinburgh Aca
demicals and Currie - could have put their case, but it has been decided to
request a more informal meeting of all clubs.
Top ten spokesman Ronnie Smith, vice-president of Boroughmuir, said yesterday:
``We have the six clubs necessary for an extraordinary meeting but feel this
way is less confrontational. We are trying to keep it informal rather than
become involved in the l
egal niceties that an extraordinary general meeting would entail.''
The pro-clubs lobby envisage a meeting which would hear presentations from the
SRU which would put the case for districts, and from those in favour of clubs.
There would then be a three-week truce during which club representatives would
return to their co
mmittees for further discussion before returning to a second meeting at which a
vote could be taken.
The Top Ten representatives have also asked the SRU to provide details of the
European Cup rules of participation so that they are in a better position to
fine-tune their counter proposals.
Yesterday, SRU senior vice-president Fred McLeod said that this latest round of
talks had been conducted in a positive manner, and he had been able to say that
players and the clubs which supplied them to the district sides which the SRU
want to compete w
ould receive around 70 per cent of the European Cup revenue.
``We have endeavoured to provide a sensible package with a view to keeping the
best players in Scotland,'' he said.
The position regarding participation of the Exiles was still unresolved, he
added, largely because of potential problems with club contracts but this was a
matter for ongoing discussion.
q GLASGOW make three changes to the side which lost 23-5 to the South last
weekend for tomorrow's inter-district championship game against Edinburgh at
Murrayfield.
Kenny Logan, Stewart MacGregor, and Gordon Doran come into the side for Gus
Turner, John Gibson, and Brian Robertson. Logan, chosen to play against the
South, withdrew because of flu. Gibson and Robertson are unavailable, allowing
district debuts for MacG
regor and Doran.
The only change to the Edinburgh side which defeated the South 31-30 is in the
pack where Edinburgh Academicals' Scott Murray is unavailable because of
gastro-enteritis. He is replaced by clubmate Malcolm McVie.
Tomorrow's game is scheduled to take place on the international pitch at
Murrayfield thanks to the under-soil heating, but because of the severity of
the weather, inspections will be held today and tomorrow morning. The
Murrayfield switchboard (0131 346 5
000) will be manned tomorrow between 10am and 1pm. Teams:
Glasgow - G Breckenridge (GHK); T Mathewson (Glasgow Acads), A Garry
(Watsonians), I C Jardine, K M Logan (Stirling County); C MacGregor (Glasgow
Acads), C Little (GHK); S MacGregor (Glasgow Acads), G Bulloch (West of
Scotland), G Doran (Glasgow Acads), G
Perrett (West of Scotland), M Norval (Stirling County), F D Wallace
(Boroughmuir), G Mackay (Stirling County), I Sinclair (Watsonians).
Replacements - A Turner, C Sangster (Stirling County), F Stott (West of

<HEADLINE>Stand on drugs attacked.  Legal action `excessive'</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974635128</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S senior judge and a chief constable have been accused of being
infected by a ``frenzy'' over drugs cases.
SCOLAG, the magazine of the Scottish Legal Action Group, has lambasted the
approach of ``hammering'' otherwise law-abiding people with the criminal law.
An editorial in the latest edition of the magazine describes the 18-month
sentence recently imposed on advocate's wife Rosalind Henderson for cultivating
cannabis as ``plainly excessive''.
SCOLAG says: ``We seem to be in the midst of another flare-up in the `war
against drugs' which has been waged with varying degrees of ferocity for nearly
30 years. It is a war which all experience shows cannot be won . . .
``Yet otherwise clever and rational people seem to be gripped with a kind of
frenzy.
``Thus Chief Constable (Ian) Oliver of Grampian region confesses his police
force alone cannot win the local war and he tries to have employers co-opted by
law to fight it for him.
``He wants health and safety law amended to force employers to impose random
urine tests for forbidden substances so as to provide evidence for their
dismissal.''
SCOLAG argues that employers are already familiar with the problem of employees
turning up unfit for work because of the abuse of alcohol and need no extra
powers to discipline or sack such people.
It adds: ``Clare Short, the Shadow Transport Secretary, is made, ignominiously,
to recant by her outraged party leader, after merely suggesting that
consideration be given to the legalisation of cannabis.
``Regrettably, the Scottish law system's leader, Lord Hope, who has been
responsible for several enlightened legal reforms, seems to have been infected
by this frenzy.''
SCOLAG refers to the Henderson case in which Lord Hope, Lord Justice General,
upheld an 18-month sentence for ``cultivating 13 cannabis plants in a locked
room in her remote farmhouse''.
In that case, Lord Hope said: ``Whatever views others may take about the
purpose and nature of the production of cannabis, the fact remains that it is
an offence which has been laid down by Parliament as punishable by a sentence
of imprisonment.''
SCOLAG argues, however, that with the exception of the mandatory life sentence
for murder, Parliament does not insist on judges imposing any particular
sentence but relies on them to select a sentence appropriate to the unique
circumstances of the case.
It points to a case in which the High Court decided that a sentence of 12
months was excessive where a first offender had cultivated cannabis for his own
use. The court substituted a sentence of six months.
``Not only is the 18-month sentence of Rosalind Henderson plainly excessive in
relation to that one, it looks positively oppressive when compared with the
three years imposed by the High Court in Aberdeen on two young men who stamped
and kicked a father t
o death.''
SCOLAG sees a ``minor ray of hope'' in the approach taken by Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth to deaths at raves caused by taking ecstasy.
``He proposes to make it a condition of licensing the premises that water and
cooling facilities be available.
``A better approach than hammering otherwise law-abiding people with the
criminal law is to ask what exactly are the harms that we seek to avert when we
control certain substances and frame measures that focus on removing these
harms.''

OFFER, the electricity industry regulator, has published proposals for the
financial ring-fencing of electricity businesses within enlarged groups after a
spate of takeovers in the industry. This will provide reassurance for consumers
worried about the po
ssibility of higher bills following the change of ownership.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, said he proposed to
modify the licences of South Western Electricity (SWEB) and Eastern Group. This
follows their takeover by the US utility firm Southern Electric International
and the Anglo-Ameri
can conglomerate Hanson, respectively. The regulator first issued proposed
amendments to electricity firms' licences in July after Southern Company's bid
for SWEB.
Southern and Hanson have already agreed to Offer's proposals which deal with
financial ring-fencing of the electricity businesses, restrictions on
activities, availability of resources and disposal of assets.
Offer's statement said that the modifications will be applied to other merged
companies in due course. Chester-based Manweb was taken over by ScottishPower
in October and North West Water has acquired Norweb.
During the bid North West Water said that the regulated water and wastewater
businesses of North West Water and the regulated electricity businesses of
Norweb would remain separate subsidiaries of the enlarged group.
Two other bids, Powergen's for Midlands Electricity and National Power's for
Southern Electric, have been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
by president of the Board of Trade Ian Lang.
``The merged companies will continue to have to meet their existing obligations
under the Electricity Act and licences,'' said Professor Littlechild. He added
that the additional licence modifications would allow him to regulate
effectively and to ensure
that customers continue to be fully protected.
Offer's announcement may deter other potential bidders such as the Texan
utility company Houston Industries.

Elizabeth Buie charts the career of a woman with a deep commitment to social
justice: being poorly regarded by the grey men of the House has never worried
her. Her departure leaves the Government with a tiny majority
WHEN Emma Nicholson entered the House of Commons in June 1987, she entered from
a dynasty so blue in blood and creed that her mother's family boasted an MP in
every parliament since modern parliaments began in the 17th century. Yet she
was seen as the hig
h-flying, iron-jawed, new Conservative woman.
She arrived there as a former vice-chairman with special responsibility for
women, a post that had existed since the 1920s, but no-one knew about it until
Miss Nicholson's appointment.
Once labelled ``the thinking man's crumpet'', she was nevertheless the only
Tory woman to sponsor Clare Short's second Bill to bar Page Three pin-ups. She
has always been outspoken about the put-downs and harassment facing women who
do make it to Westmins
ter, and has indeed faced her share of verbal harrassment. One ex-Tory MP wrote
that her nipples stuck out when she made speeches and the tabloids predictably
splashed the tale.
Nevertheless, the more typical pro-feminists have never warmed to her. They
have seen first and foremost her impeccable upper-class breeding. Her father,
Sir Godfrey Nicholson was MP for Farmham for 29 years. Her uncle, Lord
Dilhorne, was Lord Chancellor.
Her sister is married to the former Arts Minister, Richard Luce - and there is
a whole network of connections by blood and marriage stretching throughout the
party past and present.
When she speaks, her tone is jovial but firm, her delivery uninterruptible -
probably because she is partially deaf and wears a hearing aid.
Yet the surface appearance of Emma Nicholson has always belied hidden depths.
While some believed her arrogant and unresponsive, in truth it was almost
certainly due to her hearing problem. And her involvement in the publicised,
acrimonious divorce of her
husband, Sir Michael Harris Caine, from his first wife influenced her view of
Back to Basics' moral certainties: ``You cannot see into someone else's heart,
soul and motivation.''
It is said that on the day before Margaret Thatcher resigned, a member of the
1922 Committee accosted Miss Nicholson in a corridor at the House of Commons
and told her she was to blame for the fact that the Prime Minister had not won
outright on the first
ballot.
Apparently he told her: ``I always knew you were fundamentally unsound.''
To her it was a compliment, for it showed ``they'' took her seriously as a
politician. To be unsound was their crowning insult, she said.
That will be nothing to what she is called now.
But the Conservative MP for Devon West and Torridge is known to possess a hide
as thick as a rhinoceros, and being poorly regarded by the grey men of the
House has never worried her.
She was not looking for their approval when as a humble back bencher she set
off to southern Iraq, dispensing largesse to the marsh Arabs, a little-known
people whose culture could not be but alien to her constituents', just as
everyone was trying to forg
et the fall-out from the Gulf War.
Indeed, it was partly as a result of her three-year campaign that the plight of
this Arab people did climb up the international agenda. Through her work, the
full extent of Saddam Hussein's persecution of the impoverished Shi'ite
minority, the chemical bo
mbing, the draining of the marshes, and the driving of an entire people from
their ancient land became known.
More than that, Emma Nicholson made a personal as well as a political
commitment to the cause by adopting Amar Kanim, an 11-year-old orphan terribly
injured by Saddam's napalm bombing.
Many constituents have been baffled by her commitment to what they see as
faraway lands while the canker of unemployment steadily eats away at rural
Devon.
She incurred a fair degree of local displeasure when she gave her overt support
to Michael Heseltine against Mrs Thatcher. There was talk then of deselection.
What will they make of her now?
But to dismiss her as a ``maverick'' Tory is to misunderstand her deep
commitment to what she sees as social injustice - for that is and always has
been her guiding force.
To begin to understand where it springs from, one has to go back to her
childhood. The third daughter of a Tory baronet, she was born into the landed
gentry and imbued from her earliest years with the oft-claimed upper-class
traditions of service and phil
anthropy.
Her part-autobiography, part-polemic on her campaign for the marsh Arabs Why
Does the West Forget? portrayed the Nicholsons as quasi-Palliser characters.
The young Emma would follow her father on his constituency visits, noting the
poor housing conditions
of the agricultural workers.
She wrote of a visit to a children's home and the sight of a woman who was
terrible physically disabled: ``She was imprisoned and I was free; she could
not move fast and I could run; she had no family and I had everything at home.
My determination to make
a fairer world for others was born.''
She may not have known it at the time, but perhaps her natural affinity to the
disabled grew from the fact that Nicholson was disabled herself.
Incredible, it was only after winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy of
Music that it was discovered she was seriously deaf. A bad bout of german
measles during her mother's pregnancy had left her hearing and eyesight
impaired. Lengthy and painful exp
eriments with various hearing aids meant that she was an adult before she heard
birdsong or the rustle of a newspaper.
And like many people born deaf, she instinctively learned to lip-read - a skill
she still possesses and one that gives her occasional cause for amusement
during parliamentary debates. It also accounts for her booming voice and
emphatic delivery.
Her musical career thwarted, Miss Nicholson became one of the first women in
Britain to enter the emerging world of information technology. She became a
management consultant, and after taking on a project for the Save the Children
Fund, she became its di
rector of fund-raising. In the seven years she spent there, the charity's
annual income rose from #3.5m to #42m.
It seemed that she would be a career woman destined never to marry - until,
that is when she met Sir Michael Harris Caine, the chairman of Booker plc, at
the age of 45. It was then that she attracted a first whiff of political
scandal when she was named i
n the divorce petition by his first wife.
Her account of their wedding in 1987 betrays a lingering glimmer of her grand
origins. She recounted how a friend from Somerset had agreed to play the organ
on condition it was to be a small family wedding - so she just asked 36 family
members and 350 mai
nly constituency friends.
The honeymoon lasted one day. The following evening, she was contacted by her
political agent with the message to return immediately - a General Election had
been called.
Initially in her political career, Nicholson and Thatcher were allies. When
Miss Nicholson was made a vice-chairman of the party, with special
responsibility for women, she reported to the Prime Minister.
But over the years, Miss Nicholson became convinced that Mrs Thatcher was out
of touch. When the clash came it was titanic and it was over the poll tax. Mrs
Thatcher refused to listen to Miss Nicholson, and the back bencher decided to
withdraw her support
.
She never criticised Mrs Thatcher overtly, but openly supported her opponent.
As a former vice-chairman, central office had assumed she would stay loyal. Her
public view that Mrs Thatcher should resign was only what many others were
saying in private.
Her friends believe that it was this outspokenness that denied her a post in
the Major Government. But it is also possible that she relished that freedom of
the back benches to speak her mind - something she has done over the
disestablishment of the Churc
h of England, and in favour of a relaxation of abortion law. All too often, her
views have taken her beyond the caricature Tory lady.
For in truth she is more a social crusader than a politician. One Tory
colleague once said there was no point in making her a Minister as she would be
bound to find something in her department she did not agree with and resign on
principle.
In fact, it has gone further than that - a series of Government policy moves on
single parents, the disabled, asylum-seekers and other minority rights have
proved too much for her principles. She reduces the Government's majority to
three.

SCIENTISTS in the US say they are a step closer to developing a drug for fat
people after discovering the second half of the signalling system that tells
the brain when the body has had enough to eat.
In today's issue of the journal Cell, scientists said finding a receptor on the
surface of brain cells could lead to medication that would alter how the
signals of no longer being hungry are received.
The researchers from Millenium Pharmaceuticals, based in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, in collaboration with other pharmaceutical laboratories and
academic centres, have been seeking the receptor gene since the discovery last
year of the first important obesi
ty gene, called OB, and the leptin protein it produces.
Dr Robert Tepper, author of the paper published today, said a drug to treat
obesity was probably years away but that the new finding ``will jump-start
research at Millennium and elsewhere''.
The scientists say that while leptin is what sends the satiety message to the
brain, it is not a lack of the hormone that causes obesity. On the contrary,
most obese humans have higher levels of leptin.
The problem, the Millennium team theorises, may be that obese people are
resistant to the message because of a deficiency in the leptin receptors or in
the pathway leptin takes to the brain, Dr Tepper said.
Scientists hope to bypass that resistance via drugs.
``It's of course an important breakthrough and it's exciting when specific
genes in a certain trait are identified,'' said cell biologist Dr Jeanne
Lawrence. ``People who have problems with weight are often looked down upon by
people who don't, but they'r
e struggling under a different set of conditions that nature has handed
out.''-AP.

<HEADLINE>Challenge mounted to feudal law.  Absentee landlord thwarts property sale</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974635132</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CHALLENGE is to be mounted in Parliament against a ``ludicrous anachronism''
in feudal Scottish property law.
The move by Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy was prompted when an
absentee landlord based in Kent pre-empted the sale of a cottage to a local
villager in Cromarty.
Ferro Cottage, on an estate belonging to retired investment adviser Michael
Nightingale, 68, had been on the market for almost three years.
Mr Nightingale stepped in and bought the cottage only after forester John
McIver, 56, struck a cut-price deal with the vendor, the local baker.
To exercise his right of pre-emption which goes with the Black Isle estate, Mr
Nightingale simply matched the agreed price.
Landlords used to be able to exercise this right whenever they chose but under
a reform introduced by the Heath Government in the early 1970s, the right
expires if it is not used once a property comes on the market.
Mr Kennedy now wants such ``archaic privileges swept away completely''.
``I have already written to Lord James Douglas Hamilton on this question of
pre-emption because another landlord in my constituency was doing much the same
as seems to have happened in Cromarty,'' Mr Kennedy said.
``He didn't give me much hope of reform. But following the news from the Black
Isle, I will be pressing him on this matter and I will be raising it with the
Law Commission. It also strikes me that our beefed-up Grand Committee would be
an excellent place
to discuss this.
``Such rights have more to do with the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries than
they do with trying to keep people in our rural communities in the last decade
of the twentieth century. Quite simply, they have no place in a modern
democratic society.''
Mr McIver said last night: ``It is all so very unfair but I understand that is
the way he works. The property was on the market for almost three years and he
never showed the slightest interest until my deal was under way.
``I am just waiting to see how much I will lose out on legal fees. It is a
bargain buy for Mr Nightingale. He must have saved almost #20,000 on the
original sale price.''
Speaking from his Kent home last night, Mr Nightingale said he was unwilling to
comment.
``I have had no contact from the community council as yet, so I cannot talk
about something I don't know about,'' Mr Nightingale said.
It is not the first time Mr Nightingale has caused controversy in the village
by exercising his feudal rights. About seven years ago, he acquired Cromarty
Lighthouse from Northern Lighthouse Board, although several local families were
interested.
Cromarty Community Council chairman Gordon Hogg now warns that an ambitious
project to seek Millenium Foundation funding for development of the harbour
area may be prejudiced because of Mr Nightingale's actions.
The project, Cromarty 2000, was to have included Aberdeen University's Dolphin
Research Laboratory, which is situated in the lighthouse. However, Mr Hogg and
the council decided it would be unwise to include the lighthouse given the
level of local discont
ent.
As a result, Aberdeen University will have to make a separate application.
Mr Hogg said: ``There is no doubt the Cromarty 2000 plans would have been much
stronger as a package of three proposals: the harbour, the visitor centre, and
Cromarty Lighthouse. The package as a whole could total more than #3m, and it
would be a tragedy
if this ruined our chances of securing such a major boost for the village's
economy.
``We have no argument with Aberdeen University. They will be able to apply
separately. But public opinion bars us from including their scheme. There is no
way we could justify our part in securing a quarter of a million pounds for a
property on Mr Nightin
gale's estate after what he has done.''

Charles Fletcher, physician and TV personality; born June 5, l9ll; died
December l5, l995
IT is difficult today to comprehend how much consternation and opposition there
was among members of the medical profession when Charles Fletcher presented the
television series Your Life In Their Hands, a step in opening up the closed
door of medicine to
the public and patients. Perhaps only a physician as distinguished as Fletcher
could have made such a success of this courageous venture.
Fletcher, who has died aged 84, was educated at Eton and Trinity College,
Cambridge, and studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He was
involved in the early investigation of penicillin and gave the first injection
to a patient, at the Ra
dcliffe Infirmary in Oxford.
He had knowledge of medicine on both sides of the profession, having been
diagnosed as a diabetic, which rendered him ineligible for military service.
This in itself may well have shaped his subsequent career and his interest in
bringing medicine and trea
tment into people's homes.
Fletcher, whose subject for his doctorate was gastroenteritis, switched
direction, being appointed by the Medical Research Council to the directorship
of its Pneumoconiosis Unit in South Wales, an inspired choice for a dedicated
physician. With an equally
dedicated team, the work on lung disease in coal miners became internationally
recognised.
In l952 Fletcher returned to London, to the Department of Medicine at the Royal
Postgraduate Medical School in Hammersmith, to continue his research into
respiratory disease. Again with MRC support he built up a team to study chronic
bronchitis, with the
emphasis on the risks of smoking, air pollution, and respiratory infections.
Fletcher received many honours in his life of medical research, including being
appointed CBE, but probably his lasting memorial will be the TV series which
ensured medicine would never again be a book almost closed to all but a
privileged profession.

SALINAS: A judge in California has ordered a mother convicted of manslaughter
in the deaths of three children to have no more babies while still a drug
addict or face 11 years in prison. Gelenda Bosley, 25, slept in a drug stupor
while seven children in h
er care played with matches and set fire to a dry Christmas tree. Her
five-year-old son died in the blaze.
Judge John Phillips jailed Bosley for one year and enrolled her in a drug
programme, but said he would impose the maximum 11 years if she had another
baby while still an addict.
Colonel blamed
BRUSSELS: A Belgian inquiry has blamed a senior Belgian military officer for
the deaths of 10 men under his command while part of a UN peacekeeping force in
Rwanda last year. Colonel Luc Marchal is to be charged with homicide by default
in the deaths of 1
0 paratroopers, who were taken prisoner and shot after being tortured. Marchal
said he welcomed the chance to prove his innocence.
Stowaways row
PARIS: The fate of five Moroccan stowaways found aboard a container ship hung
in the balance last night. French authorities refuse to let them off the ship,
while its Dutch captain refuses to leave the port of Brest as long as they
remain aboard.
Rockets fired
MARJAYOUN: Hizbollah guerrillas fired Katyusha rockets into northern Israel
yesterday after Israeli shelling killed a civilian in south Lebanon. No-one was
hurt in the reprisal attack. Seventeen people have died in Israeli shelling of
south Lebanon villag
es this year.
Wife quizzed
BERLIN: The German wife of international guerrilla ``Carlos the Jackal'' has
returned home from Venezuela and has been questioned by prosecutors. Der
Spiegel magazine reported that Magdalena Kopp, who has a nine-year-old daughter
by Carlos, was ready to t
estify against her notorious husband.
14 wiped out
MANILA: Fourteen people, mostly children, were killed when gunmen attacked
their home in the northern Philippines. Police said the victims, members of two
families, were watching television when a house was strafed by gunfire. Three
were later beheaded. O
nly a six-year-old boy survived the massacre which may have resulted from a
land dispute.
Space toast
MOSCOW: Two Russian cosmonauts and a German will see in the New Year on the Mir
space station with brandy - because it is hard to sip champagne in zero
gravity. Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Avdeyev, and Thomas Reiter, who have been in
space since September 3, wi
ll toast 1996 while watching pictures broadcast from Earth of a clock in the
Kremlin striking midnight.
Executions rise
WASHINGTON: Fifty-six convicted killers were executed in the United States this
year, the highest total since 1957. The figure looks set to rise again next
year with more than 3000 men and women on death row. Texas, with 19, had the
most executions among
the 16 states which carried them out.
Santa mellows
ROME: Italy's leading civil rights campaigner, wearing a yellow Santa Claus
suit, was arrested yesterday for throwing bags of hashish to passers-by in
central Rome. Marco Pannella, 65, leader of the Reformist movement that seeks
the legalisation of soft d
rugs, staged another bold stunt when he gave a TV presenter a bag of hashish
during a prime-time programme.

Forte lifts profit forecast
FORTE has inched up its forecast for profit before tax and exceptional items
for the year ending January 31. It now expects to make not less than #190m
compared with earlier expectations of a #185m profit. This increased forecast
represents a 50% rise on
last year's #127m.
Earnings per share before exceptional items are forecast to be not less than
14.5p, an increase of 44%.
The new projection follows strong trading in December. Highlights were said to
be a 25% increase in the sale of London hotel rooms through a 6% rise in
occupancy and 17% growth in achieved room rate.
Forward bookings are also said to be strong. Business contracted in the UK with
tour operators and other groups for 1996-97 is projected to show revenue growth
of 13% compared with the same period last year.
Forte is the subject of a hostile #3300m bid from Granada which promptly
dismissed the hotel group's latest prediction, citing the fact that it was #10m
less than Forte's own broker's forecast last April. ``In real terms, it is
still lower than five years
ago. The earnings per share forecast is 16% less than five years ago,'' said a
Granada spokesman.
Granada remains convinced that it can improve Forte's profits by #100m in the
first financial year after takeover. Forte has attacked these claims as
``unsubstantiated''. Granada's share price has out-performed the All-Share
index by more than 150% over t
he last five years while Forte's has under-performed by 40%.

<HEADLINE>Car dealer is jailed for mileage `clocking' fraud</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974635136</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CAR dealer was jailed for 15 months yesterday after admitting he sold 47
``clocked'' cars with three million miles taken off their speedometers.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that Mark Fox, 33, bought high-mileage fleet cars
at auctions in Manchester and shipped them north on transporters to sell at
auctions in Glasgow.
Some cars had between 40,000 and 50,000 miles taken off their speedometers
before they were sold. This netted Fox an average extra profit of #800 on every
car he sold.
The case prompted immediate calls for a change in the law by Shadow consumer
affairs spokesman Nigel Griffiths, who has previously sponsored a Bill to
tackle ``clocking''.
He now intends to introduce a new measure to force motorists to declare the
mileage on their vehicles each time they renew the road tax certificate.
The Edinburgh South MP said this would mean that every vehicle's declared
mileage would be logged at Swansea and prospective purchasers could then check
its accuracy with a premium rate phone call.
Mr Griffiths said yesterday: ``This latest case is the worst I have ever come
across.
``Second-hand car buyers are being cheated of an estimated #100m every year.''
Fox went on trial earlier this month but changed his plea midway through the
case. Sheriff Brian Lockhart called for social inquiry and community service
reports and continued the case for sentence until yesterday.
Fox's defence counsel, Mr Frank Pieri, asked the sheriff not to jail him but to
allow him to do community service.
He claimed that only half a million miles had been taken from the 47 car
speedos and that the difference in profits was not in fact a great deal.
However, Sheriff Lockhart rejected this and said: ``I have considered closely
what has been said and I also have regard to the evidence led in this case.
``In my view, the minimum sentence I can impose is one of 15 months.''
Earlier this month, the court heard how the car dealer was arrested after a
nine-month undercover investigation by Strathclyde Trading Standards officers.
Yesterday, it was revealed that the team used video and still cameras in a van
with its windows blacked out.
The special car fraud investigation squad also had sophisticated satellite
eavesdropping equipment.
They discovered Fox used various aliases to cover his tracks, including the
names of well-known football players and managers.
A Trading Standards spokesman said yesterday: ``We are delighted with the
sentence - it will send shock waves through the crooked car business.
``What we uncovered in this case, which was one of the biggest investigations
of its type in the UK, is just the tip of the iceberg.
``There are other motor dealers still involved in this fraudulent trade and,
hopefully, the knowledge that the courts are treating the matter seriously will
deter them.
``We have a number of other cases in the pipeline.''

AN investigation was launched yesterday into the death of an 88-year-old war
veteran whose frozen body was found outside his home in a council-run sheltered
housing complex in Edinburgh.
Mr Nick Gould, a widower, was found by neighbours in the courtyard development
in Coillesdene Avenue, Joppa, around 8.30am, when temperatures were around
-14C. He may have lain for several hours.
Edinburgh District Council which runs the home said it had launched an urgent
inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death.
The alarm was raised by neighbours who saw Mr Gould's body lying near his door.
Locals believe the former Royal Navy seaman slipped on an icy pavement after
spending the evening out with friends.
They believe the frail pensioner, who needed a walking stick to help him move
around, would probably have been unable to get himself off the ground.
Neighbour Jess Young, 88, said she was shocked to learn of the death of her
friend.
She said: ``I knocked on his door on Thursday night to ask him in for a
Christmas drink but because I didn't get an answer I assumed he was in bed.
``I couldn't believe it when I opened my curtains in the morning and saw him
lying outside. In this cold weather, he wouldn't have a chance of surviving out
there all night. He was such a good man.''
Friend George Wilkes, who had been out drinking with Mr Gould before the
tragedy, said: ``When he left me on Thursday night, he was in great spirits.
What has happened hasn't really sunk in yet.''
Police investigating Mr Gould's death said there were no suspicious
circumstances.
An Edinburgh District Council spokeswoman said: ``The council will take a close
look and see if there are any ways we could, if needed, tighten up
proceedures.''

<HEADLINE>MP hits out at `appalling' gas supply shut-down</HEADLINE>

AN MP made an outspoken attack on British Gas last night after the supply to
15,000 people in nearly 5000 homes in his constituency was cut off.
East Lothian MP John Home Robertson said it was ``appalling'' that thousands of
people faced, in some cases, a further 48 hours of freezing conditions with no
heating in their homes after the gas supplies crashed.
Mr Home Robertson said he was ``horrified'' to find out it could take until
tomorrow evening to restore the gas supply to all the affected houses. He said
he was deeply concerned for the plight of the elderly and disabled people in
the area.
Hundreds of people from Cockenzie, Port Seton, and Prestonpans affected by the
gas shut-down sought refuge yesterday in community centres, where they received
a warm meal.
The problem arose as British Gas revealed that, over a 24-hour period up until
yesterday morning, 29 million cubic metres of gas was transported to customers
in Scotland. That is the highest amount of gas yet recorded and 12% higher than
the previous peak
demand.
Mr Home Robertson said he would be demanding compensation for all the people
whose gas supply had been turned off.
In a letter to gas board officials, he said: ``There is a widespread belief,
which I share, that the generation of profits is the only priority in the
privatised gas industry . . .
``The present crisis has apparently been triggered by a 12% surge in demand in
very cold weather, which suggests that the margin for security in the system is
woefully inadequate.''
A spokeswoman for British Gas TransCo, the company's pipeline franchise, said
last night it had people working 24 hours a day all over Scotland to maintain
its supply. It said that in many of the 5000 homes in parts of East Lothian
affected by the gas shu
t-down, hundreds of electric heaters were being distributed to vulnerable
residents.
British Gas engineers working for the pipeline franchise company, TransCo,
spotted levels of gas in its pipes dropping dangerously on Thursday evening.
Five thousand customers were immediately asked to switch off all their gas
appliances while the cause of the problem was identified.
A British Gas TransCo spokesman said last night: ``Teams of engineers are now
working in the area to restore supplies as quickly as possible. Twenty-five
people are currently going from house to house, isolating the individual
services.
``Once this work has been completed, we hope to restore gas supplies to groups
of up to 500 people at a time. We hope to restore supplies to everyone, all
being well, over the weekend.''
Last night, Lothian regional councillor John Russell said an emergency plan to
cope with the problem had been launched.
Councillor Russell said: ``This is a very severe and difficult situation. We
got the first indications around eight o'clock on Thursday night that the gas
might have to be cut off.
``The local authorities are issuing advice to people in the area of what to do
and whom to contact for help.''
Local residents said having their gas supply shut down was causing them worry.
Mr John Merritt, 60, of Prestonpans, said: ``Many people are worried about what
they will do. In my case, I will be bringing in an oil-fired heater to my house.
``I've heard of other people going walks in the cold to keep warm, rather than
sit in their freezing homes.''
A spokeswoman for Lothian Regional Council, outlining the council's emergency
plans, said: ``People should remain in their homes whenever possible.
``Those who are completely reliant on gas for cooking, heating, and food and
particularly those who are either frail, elderly or who have young children are
urged to phone a helpline set up by Scottish Gas for assistance.''
The helpline number for people in East Lothian is 0131 559 4885.

<TEXT>
THE adopted daughter of a late tobacco heiress has dropped her claims against
Doris Duke's estate in exchange for a #43m settlement.
The financial settlement to Chandi Duke Heffner, 42, was approved by a
Manhattan judge, the New York Daily News reported.
Duke, who died in 1993 at age 80, left an #800m fortune, one of the largest
private fortunes in US history. It has been the subject of complicated legal
wrangling ever since.
Duke adopted Heffner in 1988, but they later became estranged and Duke left the
younger woman out of her will. The twice-divorced heiress had no other
children.
Duke left most of her money to charity and named her butler, Bernard Lafferty,
as co-executor of the estate.
Heffner also dropped a breach-of-contract suit in which she claimed her adopted
mother reneged on a promise to support her for life, the newspaper said.
Heffner contested the will and also attempted to make a claim upon a #120m
trust established in 1917 by Duke's father, James Buchanan Duke, who founded
the American Tobacco Company.
According to the settlement, Heffner will receive #40.5m from the trust and
#3.3m from Duke's estate.
Duke's will is still subject to a separate legal fight by her former physican,
Dr Harry Demopoulos, who sought to have the butler removed as co-executor.
Earlier this year, a judge removed Lafferty from that position for allegedly
squandering the estate's assets on a lavish lifestyle. The former butler is now
fighting to resume managing Duke's fortune.-Reuter.

Some of the names are unlikely to appear on the official list, but the
selectors believe they should be our nominations for New Year honours
n Elizabeth Blackadder, artist, nominates:
Penelope Beaton. She was a very good painter, and also taught for many years in
Edinburgh College of Art, guiding people such as Robin Philipson and John
Maxwell. She was my tutor, and a lot of people, I'm sure, owe a lot to her.
n Shirley Robertson, dinghy champion who is tipped for gold in the next
Olympics:
Princess Anne, because she's deeply involved in sailing, is president of our
federation, and is always supportive of the sailors and of sailing in this
country, and of the Olympic movement. She's a great fan of Scotland, too.
n Primrose McCabe, chartered accountant, Scottish businesswoman and MD of
Primrose McCabe &amp; Co:
Anne Gloag, founder of Stagecoach, because she's a good example to the rest of
the women in business of someone who can make a success of it. She has also
done a lot to improve the economic structure of the country in terms of
creating jobs and wealth. Dr
Elizabeth Scott for her services to medicine, not just as a GP, but as a
researcher into sleeping problems. I think she's quite a character. Also
Catherine Duthie, for 20 years director in Scotland of the Macmillan Nurses.
Basically, she's done an awful
lot to make the Macmillan services in Scotland second to none.
n Roseanna Cunningham, MP:
I think we definitely need to give an honour to Princess Diana for her sterling
contribution to the campaign for an elected head of state! And can I give one
to my mum, who will be 84 in January, for all her patience and her lifetime of
unshakeable faith
in me.
n Professor Rona MacKie, Scottish skin cancer specialist, professor of
dermatology, Glasgow University:
Cicely Saunders, who introduced palliative care into the hospice movement - but
she's already a Dame, so somebody else thought it was a good idea. One to Jane
Glover, the female conductor - she's super, she brings a lot of pleasure to a
lot of people. The
next one is Dame Margaret Turner Warwick, the first woman president of the
Royal College of Physicians of London, which is a male bastion. Unfortunately,
somebody got there first with the honour!
n Vera Weisfeld, founder of What Every Woman Wants, top Scottish businesswoman,
and owner of Glasgow department store Weisfelds:
The women who stand out most in my mind are the wives of assassinated
presidents - for example, Yitzhak Rabin's wife - for the way they face life
afterwards, particularly when their husbands were canvassing for peace.
n Ray Michie, MP:
I would vote for Yitzhak Rabin's widow, and for the wife of Philip Lawrence,
the headmaster who was knifed. I think everybody admired the way she conducted
herself and the way she has held the family together. I think her views on what
we should be doing
about violence and knives are admirable. She appeared to be a very courageous
woman.
n Maria Fyfe, MP:
Princess Diana for doing more to upset the establishment than anyone I can
think of.
n Winnie Ewing, MEP:
Mrs Pankhurst. After all, she was the main voice for votes for women, and very
courageous, very eloquent and good looking and everything else, and she had the
ability to inspire a movement, which is not an easy thing to do.

BENJAMINS Law has been in particularly fine form since being campaigned on the
all-weather and can win the first division of the Snowstorm Handicap, the
opening race of Wolverhampton's afternoon fixture.
The four-year-old gelding, who shares top weight with Beauman, has made the
frame in each of his last four outings, including two wins.
He was getting off the mark for his career when winning a handicap over course
and distance in November, landing the spoils by a neck from Rood Music.
Following two creditable efforts, he was back in the winner's enclosure, after
another course-and-distance suc-cess. Starting the 4-1 favourite, he was taken
to the front by Jimmy Quinn with over a quarter of a mile remaining and had
three-quarters of a l
ength to spare over Pine Ridge Lad at the line.
Quinn once again takes the mount and, despite his hefty burden, Benjamins Law
is taken to win his third race over this course and distance.
David Evans does very well with the string he trains at his Welshpool base and
his Little Ibnr looks a sound bet to take the first race of the evening
meeting, the `Farewell 1995' Handicap.
Although he, too, has to carry top weight of 10st, he showed he is in fine
fettle by lifting a claimer, again over course and distance, earlier in the

q ANY punter wishing to have a placepot bet on Wolverhampton's even-ing fixture

The unusual arrangement has arisen because the computer system cannot

The Jackpot - with a #20,968 carry over - will be on the afternoon card at the

<HEADLINE>Revellers warned of the risks of hypothermia.  Doctors highlight deadly combination of drink and cold weather as death toll continues to rise</HEADLINE>

NEW YEAR revellers and elderly people will add to the growing hypothermia death
toll if they fail to take proper precautions against the record low
temperatures, Scottish doctors warned last night.
The stark message came as the number of recent deaths from hypothermia rose to
at least five following the discovery of another man killed by extreme
temperatures in Joppa, near Edinburgh.
One hypothermia victim has already died and two more were being treated last
night by doctors at Southern General Hospital, in Glasgow.
The freeze has also claimed the lives of Renfrewshire pensioner Elizabeth
Donaldson, 77, Mr John Murphy, 55, who had been sleeping rough in Bathgate,
West Lothian, and 16-year-old John Colquhoun, from Ayrshire, who froze to death
on Christmas Day after tr
ying to walk home in the early hours of the morning.
Glasgow has recorded its lowest temperature yet (-20C) for the past three days.
In East Lothian, 15,000 people in nearly 5000 homes were without a gas supply.
British Gas said the problem was caused by an all-time record demand for gas in
the area.
Dr Brian Potter, Scottish secretary of the British Medical Association, warned
that more lives would be put at risk over New Year if people did not take
commonsense precautions.
He said: ``There are going to be some people who die over the festive season
primarily because of alcohol but also because of the combination of the effects
of record low temperatures on people who have been drinking.
``Alcohol increases susceptibility to serious dangers from the cold, especially
the elderly and ill. Young people can be particularly at risk at this time of
year because they are tempted to drink more than they should.''
Dr Malcolm Gordon, accident and emergency consultant at the Southern General,
repeated the warnings and told people to take commonsense precautions. He urged
people to stay indoors or remain sober while celebrating the New Year.
Doctors fought for around 10 hours to save  a 67-year-old man who was brought
into the Southern General on December 21. He had a core body temperature 12
degrees below the normal level of 37C - hypothermia sets in at temperatures
below 35C. The man, who
had been found in his own house, did not regained consciousness and died later
that night.
A 70-year-old man was in a critical condition in the hospital's intensive care
unit yesterday after being found frozen just yards from his home in the
south-west of the city. An elderly woman was also brought into the hospital
yesterday morning after her
home help found her suffering from hypothermia in her house.
Two people have been treated for hypothermia at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, six at
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and two more victims are recovering in hospitals in
Dundee.
Weathermen yesterday predicted the nights will get comparatively warmer but
still remain below zero. Snow is expected over the weekend and winds of up to
30mph will make it feel as cold as before.
Shetland's snow emergency was drawing to a close last night but the islands are
still severely affected by snow and ice. The temperature dropped below zero
again yesterday afternoon after a slow thaw through the day.
Mr Malcolm Green, chief executive of Shetland Islands Council, said military
help offered by the Government would not be needed meantime, although the
council was grateful for the offer.
``I think the worst is definitely over,'' Mr Green said. ``We've got all the
power back and virtually all the roads are now open.
``As long as we don't get hit again by another heavy fall of snow, I think
we'll be OK. But the weather can change at any moment so we can't be
complacent,'' he said.
Council roads staff and Hydro-Electric crews who had worked on through the
worst of the snows were being told to stand down last night.
Shetland police said last night that Shetland's roads were ``like a 500-mile
skating rink'' after melting snow refroze at dusk.
Coastguards said they had ``almost lost count'' of the medical evacuations
carried out by their rescue helicopter in Shetland since Christmas Eve.
Yesterday, they made two more mercy flights.
Two climbers who had become trapped on Aonach Eagach Ridge in Glencoe were
rescued uninjured last night. Members of the Glencoe mountain rescue team and
an RAF rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth had been involved in the search.
Hydro-Electric said 22 houses were still without electricity on Harris, but
engineers were confident of fixing the problem last night.
Cold weather payments are to be made to people who qualify in the Western Isles.
A Department of Social Security spokeman in Edinburgh said Stornoway Weather
Centre triggered the payments for the Western Isles for the period December
22-28. This will mean #8.50 per week for those who qualify.

Bonn, Friday
GERMAN authorities have launched a investigation into the US-based online
service CompuServe on suspicion that members sent child pornography over its
world-wide Internet computer network.
The inquiry prompted the service to block access to 200 sexually-explicit
Internet discussion groups and sites where pornographic pictures are available.
Prosecutors denied that other groups were under investigation but industry
officials feared it could set an international precedent in the battle against
cyberporn and affect other on-line services and companies offering access to
the Internet.
``Our investigation is directed against CompuServe,'' said Manfred Wick, the
Munich prosecutor leading the inquiry. ``It deals with distribution of child
pornography and there is concrete evidence of a crime that leads back to
CompuServe.''
CompuServe members inundated the service's discussion forums with sometimes
abusive criticism of the decision to block access to any part of the anarchic
Internet.
Several American members denounced the German authorities for taking what they
saw as a unilateral swipe against freedom of speech in cyberspace.
``This is how Nazi Germany and Communist Russia started out by taking away
basic freedoms of the people,'' wrote one Midwesterner who said he had
``old-time family values''.
CompuServe provides online information, electronic mail, and Internet access to
more than four million subscribers in 140 countries, including 500,000 in
Europe.
Prosecutors were tipped off last month that child pornography, which is illegal
in Germany, had been exchanged over the CompuServe network. Police searched the
company's Munich offices on November 22.
Marielle Bureick, spokeswoman for CompuServe in Germany, said the company could
do little to censor the Internet and complained that laws concerning online
services were vague.
``We simply transfer data. If someone sends a letter bomb in the mail, do you
file charges against the post office?'' she asked. ``We need more clarity
regarding the legal framework.''
There is pressure on new online services in Europe because media laws are more
restrictive than in the United States.
Germany, for example, bans all neo-Nazi literature and officials are frustrated
that racist propaganda is available on the Internet from World Wide Web sites
in the United States.
Europe Online, which has just launched its service, said it chose to avoid
conflicts by blocking access to pornographic material online. ``We take the
issue of pornographic areas on the Internet very seriously indeed,'' said chief
executive Juergen Becker
.-Reuter.

PRIME Minister Lamberto Dini said that he would offer his resignation tomorrow,
clearing the decks for Parliament to decide on Italy's political future.
Dini, appointed last January to head an unelected Cabinet of technocrats, told
a news conference that he would tell President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that the
work of his government, Italy's 54th since the Second World War, was done.
``The government will offer its resignation, having completed its duty, its
mandate, and its programme,'' said the former central banker.
He spoke after the Cabinet's final decision, approval of a 5.29 trillion lire
(#2213m) package of revenue-raising measures and spending cuts. The package
completed Italy's deficit-cutting budget for 1996.
Scalfaro has already made clear that he will not accept Dini's offer until
Parliament has had its say on whether to rise for an early General Election or
to try to agree on an ambitious, long-term programme of constitutional reforms.
The Parliament, elected in March 1994, has been bitterly fractured since media
magnate Silvio Berlusconi was forced to resign as Prime Minister a year ago
after the collapse of his stormy conservative coalition just seven months into
office.
However signs were growing today that the opposing centre-right and centre-left
blocs were giving serious consideration to a possible cross-party government
with a two-year mandate to enact the reforms needed to give Italy the stability
it lacks.
The Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the main force on the centre-left and
Dini's biggest backer, proposed giving Dini a fresh mandate for a further six
months, a formula it said would safeguard Italy's European Union presidency
starting on January 1 a
nd still leave time to hold a June General Election if the exploratory talks
failed.
The proposal responded to an initiative announced by Berlusconi yesterday for a
cross-party government of the ``best minds'' in the various parties with two
years to work on constitutional and electoral reform before going to the
polls.-Reuter.

JULIE GOODYEAR, former Coronation Street landlady Bet Gilroy, celebrated her
MBE with pink champagne, saying she was ``thrilled and delighted'' with the
award which came weeks after she quit the top ITV soap after 25 years and 2002
episodes.
``This is one of the most memorable and proudest moments of my life,'' she
said. ``I am a very happy Goodyear.''
Julie was one of 1036 people honoured.
One third of award-winners were women, including Stella Rimington, the head of
Britain's security services, who becomes a dame, and agony aunt Claire Rayner,
who is celebrating her OBE in hospital.
``It's like getting a tick from teacher,'' she said.
The list contains stars from the pop scene, TV, and the stage.
Elton John, reputedly a regular guest of the royals at Windsor, is made a CBE.
Cameron Mackintosh, the stage impresario, becomes a knight.
The man behind Les Miserables and a host of other international hits kept his
award a ``dark secret'' from his friends.
``We can't even ring to congratulate him,'' said Nick Allott, his executive
producer.
Meanwhile, actress Peggy Mount, 78, gets an OBE. She excelled in the role of
formidable battleaxe.
Elsewhere, Nicolas Roeg, who becomes a CBE, found distinction as a film
director even though he ploughed a lone furrow with controversial productions,
including Don't Look Now.
There is an OBE for Ken Adam, who won an Oscar for the best art direction in
The Madness of King George.
There are also a host of Britain's sporting stars in the list. Jonathan
Edwards, the world champion triple-jumper becomes an MBE, as does Ian Rush,
Liverpool's Welsh striker.
There are MBEs too for Robert Jones, the Swansea, Wales, and British Lions
scrum half, and for Dean Richards, the Leicester and England player, the most
capped back-row forward in the world.
There is also an OBE for Dermot Reeve, captain of the successful Warwickshire
cricket team.
Elsewhere in sport, there is an MBE for Karen Dixon, an Olympic equestrienne
and Britain's leading events rider.
Ted Lowe, the whispering voice of snooker TV commentary, becomes an MBE.

THE widow of firefighter Michael Mee, who sacrificed his life in a bid to save
two people from drowning in an icy lake, yesterday paid tribute to her
husband's courage.
Mr Mee, 48, plunged through ice at Hemsworth Water Park in West Yorkshire as he
tried to save Tracey Pattison, 11, and Mr Jack Crawshaw, 51.
All three died despite five hours of resuscitation attempts in hospital.
As Mr Mee's wife, Elizabeth, spoke of her husband's bravery, council officials
disclosed that even as the bodies were being dragged from the freezing water on
Thursday, reckless youngsters refused to leave the ice on an adjoining lake.
A distraught Mrs Mee, of South Hiendley, said: ``He was a wonderful, brave man
who devoted his life to helping others. We have lived in this village for 22
years and there is no-one here who doesn't respect or like him.''
She had watched helplessly with her daughter, Katy, 19, as Mr Mee rushed to
save Tracey as she struggled in the water.
She said: ``He sprinted round the lake, telling me and Katy to dial 999. The
next thing I knew, Mike was on the ice trying to reach the little girl.''
Bachelor Jack Crawshaw, 51, plunged into the lake about the same time.
Mrs Mee, 46, said she and her daughter shouted to try to give her husband moral
support in his rescue attempt.
``Katy and I ran up and just kept shouting to him to try and support him but he
didn't have a chance. He had nothing to get hold of,'' said Mrs Mee, who also
has a son, Christopher, 17.
``The girl and the other man went underneath first, and then Mike disappeared.
After that, everything seems blurred.
``They were all gone by the time the firemen arrived.''
The second rescuer, Mr Crawshaw, lived with his brother Ian at Wrenthorpe. They
once operated a corner shop which adjoined their house but it has since closed.
Jack and Ian, whose other brother Chris lives nearby, lost their mother and
father a few years ago.
Yesterday, Mr Ian Crawshaw said: ``I'm terribly upset. I've been up all night -
I just can't believe it. Nobody knows how this feels, nobody.''
Mr Donald Andrassy, who runs a garage opposite Mr Crawshaw's home, said: ``Jack
was a quiet man who kept himself to himself. Nobody round here can believe this
has happened to him. It was a very brave thing to do.''
Council officials yesterday revealed that, as the tragedy unfolded, children
continued playing on a frozen lake just yards away.
Council staff pleaded with them to get off the dangerously thin ice but they
refused.
Hemsworth town clerk, Mr Chris Geeson, said: ``While they were dragging bodies
out of the big lake, kids were on the ice on the smaller lake.
``They must have known what had happened but, when they were asked to keep off
the ice, we just got abuse from them.''
He said lifebelts around the park, which attracts 75,000 visitors a year, were
constantly vandalised. One was thrown into the middle of the lake as a frisbee
not long before the tragedy.
As the council yesterday reviewed safety measures at the park, Mr Geeson said
the authority ``deeply regretted'' the accident but pointed out it was very
difficult to stop people going on to the ice.
``Commonsense needs to prevail,'' he said. ``The park is open 24 hours a day
and we cannot close it.
``There are already plenty of signs up with lots of `Don'ts' on them and, quite
frankly, while the majority of people adhere to them, a small minority don't.
It's very difficult to stop that.''

THE inquiry ordered by the Government into complaints about staff appointments
made by the new unitary North Lanarkshire Council will open on January 8, when
it will begin taking evidence from witnesses in public.
The new authority, whose area will take in Monklands District Council - itself
the subject of a number of inquiries over allegations of bias in employment
practices - has been criticised for the methods it used in appointing staff.
The hearing, to be held by Mr Ian MacLeod in the Council Chamber of
Motherwell's Civic Centre, is expected to hear evidence from around 80 people.
Mr MacLeod was appointed to investigate allegations that North Lanarkshire
Council had failed to comply with the statutory obligation on them under the
Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to appoint staff on merit.
Earlier this month, Mr William Nimmo Smith QC, appointed by the Government to
hold an independent inquiry into Monklands District Council, produced an
83-page report in which he said he had found no evidence to support allegations
of religious bias or nep
otism within the council.
His inquiry followed another, commissioned by the district council itself,
chaired by Professor Robert Black. His findings failed to eliminate public
concerns of a ``Monklands Mafia''.
The Black Report coincided with the entire Monklands ruling group being
suspended by the Labour Party pending its own investigations.

WHAT ever you do, I thought, don't write about Christmas. For months now, every
newspaper has been banging on about shopping ideas, overeating, and parties. A
festive season grump would be the easy option, and you won't catch me following
the crowd.
So last weekend, as I sat at the computer, I was determined to strike out and
be different. I had three attempts: one was about aeroplanes (got bored after
50 words), one about snow (everyone else doing it, abandoned halfway through),
and a rant about pet
ty nationalism and the England game in June (not topical enough: two weeks too
late). No matter that it was hard work, I was determined to avoid writing
anything about Christmas.
Christmas had largely passed me by. Like most men, I had avoided Christmas
shopping by invoking the ``I've got a Y-chromosome so it's your job to buy mum
a christmas present'' principle. So no problems there.
Even going to the carol service was relatively traumatic. One of our kids is
going through yet another ``phase''. Doctors are obviously taught that any
socially unacceptable behaviour should be dismissed as a ``phase''. To GPs,
this means ``He does whaaaa
t? Jeez, that kid is wierd!'' Our three-year-old has lately developed a case of
Premature Adolescent Behaviour Syndrome, as shown by a delight in shouting rude
words. The word `botty', for him, is the pinnacle of smut, and he uses this
word loudly, in pub
lic, whenever possible. No matter how much we feign disinterest, he knows it's
embarrassing.
On the way to the playgroup carol concert in the local presbyterian church, he
delightedly told us how he was going to sing Away In A Manger, but spiced up
with his favourite word. Matthew's singing voice is as bad as his mother's, but
what he lacks in me
lody, he makes up for in volume. We were, to say the least, a tad anxious that
he would be onstage shouting ``Away in a botty, no crib for a botty'' in his
usual tuneless yelp. It says a lot that we were relieved when he only stood
with his arms folded, f
ace scowling, making intermittent ``Harrumph'' noises. So, no problems there,
and we were still all go for a Christmas-free column.
On Christmas eve, we took the kids to Julia's birthday party. With the kids
having to sing songs about something other than snow and babies in straw, this
helped diffuse some of the yuletide mania. Despite having to do the Hokey Cokey
twice, the party wen
t well. Having known the other parents for years, I wasn't at all embarrassed
about being seen putting my whole bulky self in and shaking it all about. It's
at least less demeaning than dancing to neuromantic records which is what we
used to do for entert
ainment when we first met.
In fact, the Hokey Cokey is probably laden with meaning compared to most of
Duran Duran's rubbish. I'd probably rather be remembered hokeying, or indeed
cokeying, than poncing around to A Flock of Seagulls or Soft Cell as a gawky
adolescent.
Come C-day, I remained untroubled. The innocent wonder with which children
greet their heist is always quite special. It might be basically greed, but if
so, it's greed dressed up cutely, which makes it quite palatable. At first,
after the parcels were op
ened, I thought that we had avoided that phenomenon, The Present From Hell.
Unfortunately, it was only hiding.
You would find it hard to believe there's a thin line between love and hate
when you see the gulf between the affection that Jack held for our PFH and the
loathing it inspired in me. Some vindictive person had given the kids an
instrument of torture disgu
ised as a toy CD player. It didn't seem to be particularly sophisticated, it
just murdered the first two lines of selected Christmas songs in a loud beeping
sort of way, when you insert a small fake CD.
Initially, this was not too bad. As the day drew on, it became apparent the PFH
had been cunningly programmed to develop an Attention Deficit Disorder. It
began to play short snatches of each carol, with no breaks in between, sounding
like some wild music
al maelstrom. The PFH had evolved from a mild irritant into an unstoppable
crazed random note generator. The kids loved it. I was waiting patiently until
bedtime, hammer at the ready.
So why have I written about Christmas? Just to say that if you're out there,
PFH donor, I'll find you. I'll rebuild the PFH, and next year I'll make sure
your kid gets it. And I'll fit long-life batteries. In fact, if I'm still this
mad, I'll programme it
to sing Away In A Botty.

FORMER Barings trader Nick Leeson will not pursue an appeal against a six-year
jail sentence for cheating Singapore's financial futures exchange.
Leeson, whose disastrous deals brought down Britain's oldest bank, Barings, in
February under debts of #860m, was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in jail on
December 2 after pleading guilty to two charges of cheating.
The 28-year-old former whizz-kid trader gave notice of appeal against one of
the charges, for which he received a six-year sentence, on December 12.
He had until 5am tomorrow to present his formal petition in Singapore's
subordinate courts.
However a spokesman for his lawyers said that no petition would now be
presented on Leeson's behalf.
A court spokeswoman said yesterday that Leeson's appeal would be considered as
dropped if nothing was heard from him by the Saturday deadline.
Any appeal by Leeson would have been a gamble. Under Singapore law, even though
the defence brings an appeal seeking a lighter punishment, a court can increase
the sentence and has done so in some past appeals.
Leeson's sentence was backdated to March 2 when he was arrested in Germany, so
the nine months he served in a German jail pending extradition will be deducted
from his time.
He is now likely to serve only three-and-a-half to four years if he gets
reduction for good behaviour.
His sentence came after nine other charges of fraud and forgery were set aside,
following his co-operation with Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department.
In another development today, a Singapore court has authorised the liquidators
of Baring Futures to investigate the assets of six executives in a bid to
recover the company's losses, according to a report in the Straits Times
newspaper.
The High Court order was granted on Wednesday to liquidators Price Waterhouse.
The company will investigate officials Simon Jones, Peter Norris, Michael
Kilian, Roy Johnson, James Bax and Fu Ya Yin, said the usually reliable Times.
Jones, former Baring Futures finance director, Norris, former Barings chief
executive, and Bax, former Asia Pacific managing director, were blamed earlier
this year by a Singapore government-commissioned investigation for failing to
stop Leeson's activiti
es, and even covering them up.
Norris and Bax have denied the allegations. No formal charges have been filed,
but Singapore's fraud squad has said that it will prosecute anyone who broke
the law.-Reuter/AP.

NO more gongs for Gavin in the New Year's honours list, but it's about the only
thing he has not won this year. Player of the Year, and Scotsman of the Year
from this newspaper and that. A book, a film, This Is Your Life, and now BBC
Scotland's Sportscene
Personality of the Year.
He even kept a jumbo jet waiting on the tarmac this week as he and Diane flew
out to Colorado for a week on the piste.
Strange, though, that the BBC blew their own gaffe by arranging pictures of
Gavin with the trophy before he left, and especially when the awards programme
will not be screened until Ne'erday. It kind of kills the surprise element. I
might give it a miss.
It's been a big year for Scottish rugby, and Gavin has been a big part of it.
We'll all miss him now that he's gone. We turned the corner in January against
Canada after nine games without a win. Then we were into the Five Nations'
Championship, which cer
tainly went much better than the Doubting Thomases thought it would.
Personally, I enjoyed the game against Wales best of all and especially the run
which led to Eric Peters' fantastic try. Paris was something else when we won
for the first time since 1969. Hopefully it won't be another 26 years before we
win on French soi
l again, by which time video footage of that Hastings try would be looking as
grainy as that black-and-white footage of the Jim Telfer try which the BBC show
religiously every year since.
The World Cup was special. It was a great experience in a country which was in
the throes of great change. Who knows how far we could have gone if Emile
N'Tamack had not scored that try in the dying seconds which lined us up against
New Zealand.
For Stirling County, too, 1995 was special. It was the year in which we won and
lost the championship title and because of league reconstruction, that's the
first time that's happened.
Nevertheless, we came second and equalled Melrose on points, thus cementing our
place as one of the top sides in Scotland. It's not bad going for a club that
was looked upon as one of the country cousins of Scottish rugby not so long ago.
Weather, and Murrayfield's undersoil heating permitting, I get my first run of
the season with Glasgow tomorrow. It's been frustrating to sit on the sidelines
injured while the district championship was going on, and we just have to end
on a winning note
against Edinburgh.
Then, next weekend, we swop Murrayfield for the, hopefully, sunnier climes of
Italy. It's an A side in name only. This is a full metal jacket squad and
although the Italians - named the most improved side in the World Cup - will be
no pushovers, a good wi
n would set us up nicely for the start of the Five Nations a couple of weeks
later.
This weather is a real bind for us farmers. At a Murrayfield squad session on
Tuesday night, I was just remarking to fellow farmer, Doddie Weir, that it was
so cold the milk was freezing in the cows' udders. Doddie just looked at me and
said: ``Is that ri
ght?''
Now, I know that Doddie is more at home these days with his mobile phone and
his brewery rep's motor, but you would have thought that he would recognise an
agricultural wind-up when he heard it. A case of ``pull the udder one!''

In the 1950s, Alistair MacLean went from Rutherglen schoolteacher to world
best-selling author in record time. His first two books, HMS Ulysses and The
Guns of Navarone, set the pattern for 30 years of phenomenal success.
But it all began when he won The Herald's 1954 short-story competition with a
sea tale called The Dileas. That attracted the attention of Collins, the
publishers.
Now, eight years after his death, some unpublished stories from that same
period have been found in the cellar of his mansion, overlooking Lake Geneva.
Appropriately, having sparked off the career of Alistair MacLean, The Herald is
delighted to bring this
literary romance full circle by publishing the first of the new discoveries.
The Black Storm is another of the author's sea stories . . .<
I DON'T know how much old Glass was worth. Come to that, I don't suppose he
knew himself. But he was as rich as Croesus, that's a fact.
But Croesus or no, peer of the realm or no, he was still the same old Duncan
Glass and hardly a week went by but he came down from the Big House to my
harbour office to pass the time of day with me. But he'd something on his mind
that Saturday - a sunny b
reezy morning in late June.
He got his pipe drawing well, then looked round the harbour, at the waves
sparkling in the sunshine, at the mast-tops of the fishing boats dancing in the
breeze. Then he turned to me, direct as always.
``Tom,'' he said quietly, ``what do you think of them? Really think of them, I
mean.''
``Think of who?''
``You know damn well who! The Tallons, of course.'' He jerked his pipe stem in
the direction of the two men working round an old varnished yellow pine fishing
boat. ``Look at them. A holiday, every other man going to the Games, and there
they are, still a
t it.''
``They seem to like working,'' I said, mildly enough.
Lord Glass glared at me. ``I didn't ask you.......''
``All right, all right,'' I said quickly. ``Well, if you must know, I like old
John Tallon and his son.''
Glass glared at me again. ``No-one else does.''
``No?'' I nodded through the window, then caught Glass's arm as he reached for
the door handle. ``Leave her be, Duncan. What harm can she come to?''
``Aye, maybe you're right,'' he muttered. ``For the moment anyway.''
He stood in silence and watched the young girl walking down the quay, dark hair
and red kilt blowing in the breeze, one hand holding canvas, paints, and
brushes while she waved to the Tallons with the other. As she came opposite the
Tallons' boat, the Jea
nnie, a young man jumped up on the quay, smiled and spoke to her. Moments later
he was sitting on a bollard, looking at the canvas the young girl was showing
him. The black and flaxen heads were very close together.
``I don't like it.'' I could hear Glass's teeth biting hard on his pipe stem,
and his voice was kind of savage and quiet at the same time. ``I don't like it
at all.''
``What you mean is you don't like them.'' I knew how old Duncan Glass felt
about Mairi - since her parents had been killed his 11-year-old granddaughter
was the only person he had left in the world - but I felt he was being a bit
hard. ``Why don't you be
honest about it, Duncan?''
``Can you blame me?'' he said angrily.
``No more than I blame any of the others. You're just as bad as they are.
Forty-five years in the city of London, and you're still a West Coaster at
heart. The Tallons are East Coasters. Oil and water never did mix.''
Glass growled deep in his throat, but I held up my hand.
``And you're just as nosy as the others. The Tallons are mysterious, and you
don't like mystery. But if they care to sail through the Caledonian Canal and
change the Jeannie's registration marks in Skye so that they don't know where
they come from, surely
that's their business. It's certainly none of ours.''
``You talk like an East Coaster yourself,`` Glass said sourly. ``Admit it man,
they're a close, stand-offish couple.''
I admitted nothing. I knew he was wrong, but I knew I couldn't convince him. I
knew, too, what really rankled with Lord Glass and the others......
The Tallons were far and away the best fishermen in Inverglas. Only six months
in the village and already they caught more every day than any two other boats
out together, more than men who had fished these sounds and banks all their
lives. It was natural
, I suppose, that the men should resent that, the seven other skippers who
sailed Lord Glass's boats on a profit-sharing basis. It was natural that they
should stand around on the quay, sullen and morose, after a poor day's haul,
while the spotted olive g
reen and white of cod, the silver blue of mackerel spilled from the Jeannie's
overflowing baskets as they were hoisted up for weighing.
However, I couldn't very well say this to Glass, and I knew he thought I'd
nothing more to say in their defence. He changed the conversation, slightly.
``Mairi's down here pretty often, isn't she?''
``As often as the boats are in. Otherwise she's usually over by Sunda Bay.
Always painting. A very gifted young lassie you've got there, Duncan.''
``She's all that.'' Lord Glass permitted himself a proud smile, then remembered
what he was about. ``She sees young Tallon quite often, eh?''
``Now and again.'' I was feeling uncomfortable. ``When he's not working.''
``No idea what they talk about?''
``As a matter of fact, I have.'' I was on better ground here. ``Always about
painting. Heard the two of them at it the other day. Young Tallon was telling
her how important it was that she should always see - see lines and depths and
shadow and above all
colour. He was pointing out a particular part of the village or harbour or sea
or sky and asking her to describe it for him - just to find out how much she
saw, and how much she didn't. I'm sure he helps her.''
``What the devil does he know about painting?'' Glass snorted. ``Ignorant young
lout who's never.......''
``How the devil do you know.......'' I started angrily, but Glass recognised
the signs from 60 long years ago.
``Sorry, Tom, sorry: let's not fight about it. But I still don't like it. It's
gone far enough. I'm going to stop it.''
``Mairi's safer here than in Sunda Bay. If the tide.......''
``MacArthur'' - that was his chauffeur - ``is always with her. She'll come to
no harm. See you next week, Tom.''
After he'd gone - and taken Mairi with him - I got to thinking about the
Tallons. They were a queer pair all right, father and son. Always they were
together, John Tallon with his broad shoulders and grey beard and the useless
leg swinging between the cru
tches, and his son, Michael, half a head again taller than his father, with
long blond straight hair and a queer faraway look in the washed-out blue of his
eyes.
Always they were together - always. It didn't matter whether they were out
fishing, or mending lines, or getting bait or just digging in the kitchen
garden behind the little cottage they had rented on the hill, they were as
inseparable as Siamese twins. T
hey worked like Trojans, almost inhumanly hard, kept themselves strictly to
themselves - and were the most disliked folk in town. Until, that is, the night
of the Black Storm.
The Black Storm. It came in the early evening of the day of the Glasgow Fair,
in July, and Inverglas was a ghost town for the night. It was the big day of
the year in Dalbreath, seven or eight miles away across the bay - gala fete,
sideshows, and a dance
that lasted far into the morning. Every person who could be there was there.
But not everybody had gone - not quite. I stayed in my harbour office, because
the weather forecast had been a bad and bitter one - Force 9 winds with gale
seas and thunder - and I had to be there, all the time, in case some ship in
distress might be look
ing for help or shelter.
And the Tallons were there, too - it didn't need any clairvoyant to know that
they wouldn't be in Dalbreath. It wasn't just that they knew that they weren't
wanted there: the Tallons never spent any money on amusement, and not a
ha'penny more on drink - a
nd everybody knew you couldn't enjoy a good old-time dance without a dram or
two in the right place. Come to think of it, I don't suppose that helped their
popularity any - West Highland fishermen tend to look a bit askance at a man
too mean to put his ha
nd in his pocket for a drink.
The Tallons had just finished pumping out the Jeannie when the rain started. It
didn't just rain - the black skies opened and it came down in pailfuls.
At once the two men turned up their collars and hurried up the quay as fast as
old John could hobble, but that wasn't very fast. I slid open the door of the
office as they stumbled by and shouted on them to come in.
They were glad enough to come, I can tell you. As I closed the door behind
them, old John sunk into a chair and let his breath go in a long gasp.
``Thank you, Mr Burnett, thank you.'' He looked out at the sky, already dark
almost as a tomb, and shook his head. ``It's going to be a wild night.''
``It's going to be all that.'' I nodded at the stove. ``Just brewed a pot of
tea. Plenty for three.''
John Tallon hesitated, then smiled. ``It's very kind of you, Mr Burnett.''
But we never had that cup of tea. I was just about to pour it when the door
crashed open and there was Lord Glass himself, his face wild, grey with
exhaustion and his breath coming in great heaving gasps.
``Where are all the men, Tom, the fishermen?'' It took him three long breaths
to jerk this out. ``I can't see.......''
``They're all over at Dalbreath, Duncan. You know that. Fair Friday. What in
the name of God.......'' I broke off suddenly, because I already knew.
``Mairi?''
``Aye.'' He nodded heavily, his face sunk in his hands.
``Sunda Bay?''
He nodded again, said nothing.
``And the tide making more than half already!'' I could feel the cold horror in
my blood. ``But MacArthur, the man who looked after her.......''
``Gone to Dalbreath, and never a word to me.'' The spirit was back for a
moment, the voice savage. ``When I see him again.......'' He left the sentence
unfinished.
``You're sure she's there?''
``I know. When the storm came on, I looked for her. Couldn't find her. Drove to
Sunda, saw her pony there.'' His fists were clenched, his chest still heaving.
``I ran down the cliff path - but it was too late. The beach is cut off already
and the water wi
ld.''
``You saw her?''
``I saw her. Shouted to her to get as far up the cliff as she could. Then I ran
all the way here.''
The wind was booming outside now, rising up to gale force. How long, I thought
frantically, could a little girl hang on in that. Men, ropes, but no, that
overhang of the Sunda cliff......
I started and turned as a sudden blast of wind blew papers all over the office
floor. Michael Tallon had the door open, his father just behind him, crutches
already under his arms. It was John Tallon who spoke.
``We'll be back in the half-hour,'' he said quietly. ``You can come if you like
- but it's a wild night.''
And, my heaven, it was a wild night. The Jeannie rolled and pitched her way
across the bar as if every shuddering plunge into the troughs was going to be
her last, but she was a tough old craft with a Gleniffer diesel and John knew
how every single combin
g wave was setting towards us even although it was as black as the Earl of
Hell's waistcoat. He handled that boat as if he had been born with a tiller
under his arm.
We had to quarter our way round Sunda Point - if we had gone broadside into any
of these steep-walled troughs we'd have broached to and foundered in a matter
of moments - and, by Jove, it's a trip I don't want ever to do again. What with
the howling of th
e wind, the thunder beginning to rumble, the rain and the spray tearing at our
faces and the wild staggering of the Jeannie - well, as I say, once in a
lifetime was once too many.
But we made it, and in a few minutes we were running into Sunda Bay, into the
comparative quiet of the water behind the point.
We were maybe 40 yards off the cliff - the sand was already deep under water -
when John shoved the Gleniffer into reverse and shouted on Michael to let go
the anchor. Surefooted as a cat in the darkness, picking his way with uncanny
precision through the
boxes, lines and ropes that lay always in the same tidy positions on deck,
Michael Tallon moved to the bows and 30 seconds later the Jeannie was anchored
head-on to the mouth of the bay, the Gleniffer just ticking over to take part
of the strain, the cou
nter swinging wildly only two or three feet from the face of the cliff.
It wasn't really a cliff at the bottom - but it wasn't far off it. Halfway up
the rock bulged out a wicked overhang, and it was just below this that we saw
Mairi right away, her white blouse plain against the darkness of the rock. She
was hanging on to a
spur for dear life, and in the sudden lulls between the gusts of wind we could
hear the wee soul crying.
We all waited for Michael to fetch her - it wasn't a difficult jump ashore, nor
the climb too dangerous for an active young man like himself. Old John couldn't
go - not with only one leg. I suppose Glass or myself could have gone, but
don't forget neither
of us would ever see 65 again.
I don't think I was ever more dumbfounded in my life than when I saw Michael
hesitating, making no move at all to go - and I'll never forget the anguished
expression on his father's face - I was by his shoulder - as he sat there, just
watching him.
``You despicable young coward!'' Duncan Glass, now that he saw his
granddaughter still safe, was back on balance again and his voice was the lash
of a whip. ``You're a damned good man - when you're sitting with a child's
sketchbook in your hand. But if I
ever see you again within a mile.......''
He choked in anger, made to push past Michael, then sat down with a gasp on a
coil of rope as an iron arm caught him by the lapels and forced him off his
feet. Michael Tallon paused only to say a few soft words to his father, bent
his ear to the reply, th
en leapt ashore.
Not quite three feet, yet he almost missed it. His ankle seem to give under
him, he tottered back wildly on his heels, his arms flailing, then recovered
his balance at the last moment, caught hold of a projecting rock and started
climbing.
I didn't see all of the climb - it was too dark for that - but what I did see I
wouldn't have believed. I don't think I've ever seen a man so clumsy on a rock
face. Cat-footed as a tightrope walker on a rolling deck, he was quite lost on
a cliff-face. He
fumbled and pawed and slipped his way up to where the little girl lay crying,
and my heart was never out of my mouth. But reach her he did, caught her in one
arm - the poor wee girl was near exhaustion by this time - and made his way
slowly, awkwardly, do
wn again. He was so engrossed in what he was doing that I'll swear he'd have
stepped into the sea if old John hadn't shouted a warning.
The rain had almost stopped now, and the wind changed - changed so that the
stern of the Jeannie had moved out seven or eight feet. Duncan it was who
caught up a heaving line and threw an end to Michael so that he could pull the
stern close in. The line h
it Michael on the chest, and fell into the water before he could clutch it.
Duncan Glass pulled in the line, coiled it and flung it once more. Michael
lifted his hand to catch it as it whistled towards him, but again he missed it
- it seemed to strike the back of his wrist and glanced off into the sea.
``For God's sake man, are you blind?'' Glass shouted in exasperation. He hauled
in the rope, but I took it from him, and threw it carefully so that it fell
over Michael's shoulders. My mouth was dry, I felt as cold as the tomb.
``He is blind, Duncan,'' I said, and my voice was only a trembling whisper.
``He's completely stone blind.''
And he was. The rest we learned later that night, sitting before a great fire
in Glass's library, stiff tots of whisky in our hands.
``We were both in the same train smash, Lord Glass,'' old John was saying. He
seemed to be glad to be talking, glad that the secrecy and concealment were all
over. ``That's how I got my leg - well, shortened a bit. And Michael - he got
hurt at the same ti
me. He - well, you've seen, he doesn't see too well.''
Doesn't see too well, I thought - the boy moved in a world of utter dark! The
longer I sat there, the clearer things became - and the more I writhed in
shame, for myself and my people. No wonder the boy had never left his father's
side. No wonder everythi
ng on the deck of the Jeannie had always been in exactly the same place. No
wonder, now, that he moved so surefootedly aboard in the dark - day and night
were all the same to Michael Tallon. And no wonder that he had had little Mairi
describe everything s
o minutely to him - not only had he wanted to ``see'' the new world he was
living in, but he himself, we found, was an artist, just finishing his final
year in the School of Art and she had represented for him the one place where
his real interest in life
lay - or had lain.
``But good God, man,'' - it was Glass speaking - ``Why did you never tell us?''
``Because there is - or was - hope for him yet.'' Old John sounded suddenly
tired. ``They told us in Glasgow that there's a man in Baltimore, in John
Hopkins Hospital, who's a genius in the particular eye surgery Michael needs.
So - well, we were trying t
o save a little money to go there and pay for the operation.''
The simplicity of it all, the magnificence of it all, left Glass and myself
with nothing to say. A one-legged man, a blind boy, the bitter toil from the
dawn till long beyond the sunset - no, this lay beyond tears....... After a
while, Glass said weakly:
``But you could still have told us.''
``And lost my fishing licence? A blind crew? Where would the money have come
from then?''
``I don't know, I don't know at all.'' Glass drained his whisky tumbler, sat
still for a moment, then smiled, a long slow smile. ``But, by God, I know where
it's coming from now.''
Michael hasn't had his operation yet - but the last letter from John said that
the preliminary tests were almost over. And when it does come - well, I know
he'll carry with him the hopes and prayers of every soul in Inverglas.

TWO Scots golfers who reached the pinnacle of their careers in 1995 and a woman
rugby stalwart in Stranraer have been honoured
Bernard Gallacher and George Macgregor have followed similar paths in the
parallel professional and amateur golfing worlds, culminating this year in the
Ryder and Walker Cup successes against the United States, (writes Douglas Lowe).
Gallacher, 46, from Bathgate, was captain of Europe for the third and final
time, while Macgregor, 51, of the Glencorse club in Penicuik, following four
years as Walker Cup captain, was this year chairman of selectors for the Great
Britain and Ireland sid
e which was coached, co-incidentally, by Gallacher.
The pair were Lothians team-mates in the late sixties.
It is appropriate that both should receive their OBEs together.
Mrs Jessie Ferguson, MBE, now 77, has been associated with Stranraer Rugby Club
since it was founded half-a-century ago.
Mrs Ferguson got involved with the club through her late husband, William, a
lawyer, and their son, William, who were both players.

As midnight on December 31, 1999, approaches STEPHEN McGINTY wants to party
into the new millennium.
FORGET this year, what about December 31 1999? On the night when the calendar
rolls over to reveal the big 2000, just where do you plan to witness the birth
of new millennium?
It's not such a daft question. Around the world hotels are being filled up with
folks anxious not to miss the night of not one, but one hundred lifetimes. The
London Savoy has been fully booked since 1990. Disney World in Orlando has sold
out nearly all i
ts 17,000 rooms.
If it's winter in New York you fancy, The Rainbow Room has already been able to
stop taking reservations for its New Year's Eve bash, priced at only $1000 per
person excluding drinks. While the Empire State Building could grow by feet
just using its peak
as a paper spike for hiring requests.
London has been swept up years ago, with the Albert Hall booked since 1975, the
Roof Gardens sagging under thousands of requests for the night's hire and
British Airways opening a requests department to work all through those
received.
Yet in Scotland, the one nation most entwined with Hogmanay - something which
we do so well - hotels, cities, even castles seem curiously laid back.
Historic Scotland, caretaker of Edinburgh Castle has said: ``not now'' to any
enquiries by Richard Branson's Virgin to hire Scotland's greatest monument for
a monumental millennium bash.
Edinburgh's Hogmanay, now in its third year, is building towards a climax in
1999. The five-day event, produced by Unique Events, is funded by Edinburgh
District Council, Lothian Regional Council and Edinburgh Enterprise. The
current plan is to draw media
attention away from American cities such as New York. Promoter Peter Irvine
believes Scotland already tops the world.
He said: ``No other city has a full programme of events like Edinburgh. We are
very aware of the approaching millennium celebrations and once we have come out
from under this one we will all be preparing ourselves for year 2000. But we
are already aware o
f the immense problems.''
``There is the problem of billing appropriate acts. Everyone will want
Pavarotti but will Wet Wet Wet still fit the bill, would they want to?''
This year the city's hotels and guest houses became fully booked by
mid-November with late enquirers being shunted out to Fife and the Borders in a
bid to secure accommodation. Yet some have already expressed an interest in
booking up for 1999.
A spokesperson for reservations at the Caledonian Hotel says that despite a
number of enquiries the hotel has not yet decided what it will be doing for a
millennium celebration.
Glasgow will be linking its millennium celebrations to its year as City of
Architecture. Leader of the council, Pat Lally says: ``The year 1999 will be a
major triumph for Glasgow as City of Architecture and I feel we will all be
entitled to celebrate.''
Anyone wishing a rare touch that only history can provide will have to run the
risk of having nowhere to go. Anyone wishing to hire a Scottish castle for the
night will have to wait until nearer the time.
A spokesman for Historic Scotland said: ``We can't set costs that far ahead and
because they are the Government's property, they might be using them in 1999.
We have had one or two approaches from people but we've had to say come back
nearer the time.''
Antonella Sacchero at Gleneagles says the hotel has received a steady stream of
enquiries stretching back over the past 10 years. But reservations for the
hotel will not actually open until next year, probably May.
Cameron House by Loch Lomond is in a similar situation with enquiries running
to figures double the room availability. A reservation list will be opened
during the next six months, with their capacity stretched nearer the time with
the building of a numbe
r of new lodges.
However, anyone wishing to try to suck the air from others' more billowing
plans, can point out that strictly speaking the millennium does not end until
the following year: December 31 2000. But this is unlikely to deter people such
as one British busines
sman who is organising simultaneous parties in Sydney, London and New York -
and will appear at all three.
The difference in attitudes is light-years from the last millennium's end when
thousands of northern Europeans expected the world to end at midnight.
In five year's time, even if Peter Irvine doesn't order one of the world's
biggest fireworks direct from China for Edinburgh's celebrations, the second
millennium is still sure to end with a bang.

<HEADLINE>Business leaders call for further interest rate cuts</HEADLINE>

AS the year draws to a close, business leaders are urging the Chancellor to cut
interest rates again early in the new year to sustain business growth.
The British Chambers of Commerce yesterday called for more interest rate cuts
throughout the year. This follows CBI president Sir Bryan Nicholson's
suggestion on Thursday that the time might soon be right for a further
reduction and that the CBI was keepi
ng a close check on the moderating pace of growth among manufacturers.
The BCC deputy director- general, Richard Brown, was more forceful, stating
that while the main priority for the Government of a stable economic
environment with low inflation looks like being maintained and will bring
increased prosperity to UK firms, ``
essential to this are more interest rate cuts throughout the year. Britain has
the highest interest rates in the G7 and these must be brought down as a matter
of priority''.
The Chancellor sliced a 0.25-point off rates after his meeting with the
Governor of the Bank of England on December 13. Their next two monetary
meetings are scheduled for January 17 and February 7. The Chancellor has
forecast 3% growth for the UK economy
next year but most economists believe this to be too ambitious unless there is
a further stimulus through another rate reduction. Most forecasts centre on
2.5%-2.75% growth.
In his annual message to the 200,000 members of the BCC, the deputy
director-general said that investment looks set to rise, which can only be good
for British firms, improving quality and competitiveness in overseas markets.
He stressed, though, that the Chancellor must keep a tight grip on Government
spending if the economy is to grow without overheating.
``Markets overseas, particularly in Europe, continue to present challenges to
British companies. These challenges are being seized upon, and 1996 looks set
to see an increase in the UK's share of markets as the drive for global
competitiveness continues.'
'
Mr Brown said that business is strongly committed to Europe, and Britain needs
to play a full and constructive role in its development, arguing for
competitiveness, deregulation and job creation. He warned that ``Europe must
not fetter its business and ci
tizens with unnecessary regulations'' and that it must be founded on the
principles of the free market.
n DR NEIL Blake, research director of economic forecaster Business Strategies,
expects economic growth of around 2.73% in 1996 with exports doing well. He
considers that the massive build-up in stocks will ensure home market demand
can be met without exce
ssive imports and, as a consequence, the balance of payments will not suffer
unduly.
Consumer spending itself is forecast to rise by 2.75%. In the absence of strong
growth in real earnings, the driving force will be personal tax cuts (and more
important the first year without tax increases since 1993); windfall gains of
#50 off householde
rs' electricity bills in England and Wales; the maturing of the first Tessa
accounts; and the prospect of gains to investors from building society mergers.

A MAN accused of throttling prostitute Leona McGovern had injuries to the
inside of his hands, a court heard yesterday.
Mr George Walker, 31, claimed later the healed blisters were old rope burns.
However, a police surgeon, Dr Colin McKelvie, said the blisters could also have
been caused by Mr Walker pulling hard on a belt.
Ms McGovern, 22, was found murdered with a belt round her neck, the High Court
in Glasgow has heard.
She also had multiple bruises and stab wounds around her head and face. Her
ribs were broken and the impression of a boot was stamped on her chest.
Dr McKelvie said Ms McGovern was found lying behind the Art Centre in
Washington Street, Glasgow, on June 2.
He said: ``She was curled up behind a wall and a fence and her blood was still
flowing down a flight of stairs.''
An apple that Ms McGovern had been eating was found nearby.
Dr McKelvie said that, weeks later, on August 25, Mr Walker told him the healed
blisters to his palms and fingers had been caused when he was pulling on a rope.
Pathologist Dr Eleanor Murray said a star screwdriver or a piece of steel fence
could have been used to stab Ms McGovern.
Cause of death was strangulation, said Dr Murray.
Mr Walker denies punching, kicking, and stamping on, strangling, and stabbing
Ms McGovern. The trial continues next week.

ENGLISH football would be entitled to mark the end of this year with unfettered
enthusiasm. The game in the south took a beating from allegations of bribery,
sickening acts of violence, and wretched cases of drug abuse. Some of the most
influential people
, George Graham and Eric Cantona, in particular, took centre stage at times
during the last 12 months and did no more than scythe the legs from football
which spent a lot of time prostrate in a mire of sleaze.
Fingers remain pointed at some players, but the game is recovering, and with
the European Championship finals to be played in various parts of England in
the summer, hopefully the stench of decaying morals will clear.
Many of the world's finest players will vie for our attention and football
could be a joyous occasion again, provided, of course, none of us allow the
finals to be hijacked and used as a platform for the unspeakable creatures sent
out by extreme right gro
ups. Football has been blighted by these contemptibles, but they are not a
product of the sport which often feels alone in trying to cope with the problem.
The return of Scotland to Wembley offers a platform for abuse, and society will
have to help to deal with the shameful organisations who have attached
themselves to a sport which has shown itself capable of creating its own
monsters. It would be a dreadfu
l shame if football is dragged further down at a time when the signs seem to be
suggesting that through the vigilance and concern of the Professional
Footballers' Association good might be triumphing over evil.
The PFA are conscious of the sport's need to project an acceptable image, and
as you would imagine, they are anxious to protect the rights of their members.
With 100% membership, they are a potent and influential union in these times
when the power of the
people has been eroded in most other professions.
The PFA also are a well financed body - since '92, when the players threatened
to strike, the PFA have been taking a percentage of money brought in through
deals with television companies, whose views are given credence within the
English game's administr
aton.
Indeed, the association are succeeding in pressing for changes within the
development programmes employed in England. For years, the Charles Hughes'
method has been the modus operandi, but the players' union - believing that
system to be outdated - have c
hallenged conventional thought and are trying to force their own psychology on
the authority.
The PFA's chief executive, Gordon Taylor, who also is chairman of the
federation of football unions throughout the world, FIFPRO, has emerged as a
formidable and respected leader, but he benefits from having around him a team
equally adept. Among them can
be found Scotland international winger Pat Nevin, who is in his third year as
chairman.
The 32-year-old Tranmere Rovers player has passed beyond feeling shocked by the
worst excesses of players unable to cope either with their fame or wealth, but
familiarity has not dulled his compassion and he remains supportive of the
members.
Nevertheless, the former Clyde, Chelsea, and Everton player, does wince
whenever a Vinny Jones speaks or allows a newspaper to use his name at the head
of a column. Nevin, though, was one of the first in the modern game whose
lifestyle challenged the wide
ly held belief that footballers had their brains in their feet.
Jones and Nevin, an incongruous pairing. Like Neanderthal Man meets Renaissance
Man, or blind rage and calm reason. However, Nevin, who would prefer to study
the classic line of the marble nose on Michelangelo's David, while Jones might
be unable to resis
t an urge to bite it, feels the denigration of the footballer has gone far
enough. It is time, he believes, to look at the positive.
Nevertheless, he did admit some players, who use their brains every day of the
week, and not just Saturdays, found life in the dressing room easier if they
disguised any academic prowess. This tendency to underplay intelligence perhaps
helped to perpetuat
e the myth that footballers are dullards. But Nevin claims the opposite, and
has statistics to back his call.
Two years ago, he says, the PFA did a check and found that more than half of
the YT kids coming into the game were capable of achieving `A' standard in four
or more levels. The PFA-driven youth training scheme - 93% of the young players
took exams which w
ere the equivalent of two A level passes - was hailed as the top one anywhere
in Britain.
All young players coming into the English game have to take national or general
national vocational qualifications which are accepted by universities, with the
PFA putting #500,000 into the scheme. Rightly, they are proud of their results.
``Hopefully we are smart enough to look at society and realise what is
happening,'' Nevin said, ``and we try to help players to avoid the various
dangers. For every nasty piece of work in our game who makes it on to the front
pages, there are dozens of go
od, honest, and decent players who work hard within their communities.
``The great majority of players carry their responsibilities well, some don't.
That is the reality, but I know the media are not generally interested in that
side of our game.''
While it is the PFA's priority to work for, and to protect, their members,
Nevin accepts the union must also be mindful of the game's needs and it could
be to everyone's benefit that there is a greater intelligence emerging within,
even if the behaviour o
f a very small minority attracts a disproportionate amount of attention.
That is a measure of the society in which we all live but, quietly and
effectively, Nevin and his people are working to strengthen the foundations.
``It might also be worth pointing out that while the problems of alcohol and
drug abuse grow in society, it seems that football is attracting fewer kids
with any of these difficulties,'' he said.
``We offer courses and try to educate players on the problems of drugs,
alcohol, gambling, and various other topics, because footballers do tend to
have a lot of time on their hands.
``It might not be ideal for clubs to have young players for a short spell each
day and then expect them to do the right things when they are away from the
ground, so we try to help in this respect. As a union we are concerned about
the dangers players fac
e.''
The PFA offer a wide range of courses, including business studies, chiropody,
langauges, arts, massage, the London taxi knowledge, politics, as well as
Christian ministry, and they have given 794 education grants costing #300,000
already this year.
With players willing to learn, the game in England seems healthy and is
enhanced by the willingness of European players to sign up and play before
increasing attendances.
The PFA know a certain level of intelligence is required to play the modern
game properly, and although no-one is suggesting that soon only nuclear
scientists might have the mental capacity to play, the fact is that footballers
capable of original thought
will prosper.
``I believe most players realise a gap has developed between them and the
Europeans,'' Nevin said, ``but when clubs are banned from Europe for five
years, as the English were, you must accept that game will fall 10 years behind.
``However, English clubs have had serious problems in dealing with the
three-foreigner rule while playing in Europe, but it is also true that, while
in exile, teams like Wimbledon, Crystal Palace, and Sheffield United came to
the fore and their style of p
lay did not help.
``English football did not grow in that period, but I think an increasing
awarensss of what is needed and the influx of European players is helping to
shatter the public perception that there is a lack of intelligence in football.
``That intelligence must also be evident in coaching, which is absolutely
essential.''

Who will be the rising stars of the New Year, the up
and coming movers and shakers of arts, industry,
science and education? Here, and on the next two pages, Herald specialists
select their tips for the top.
POP/ROCK: DAVID BELCHER
FORD KIERNAN. Pasty-faced all-round Glaswegian comedy genius, whether in live
stand-up with partner John Paul Leach, as an impressionist on Radio Scotland's
On The Ball, or as an actor. See him as one of the stars of BBC Scotland's
forthcoming Pulp Video
series.
ONE DOVE. Most of their 1995 was written off following vocalist Dot being badly
injured in a car accident. Then their record company, London, dropped them.
When the band's long-delayed second album surfaces, however, you can be fairly
sure it will be one
of 1996's healing highlights.
LUNGLEG. Green Day? Don't talk to me about pretend-punk laddies from America
when Scotland's got the real thing in the form of raucous rrrumpus-burrrds
Lungleg.
EARTHLING. Trip-rapper Earthling is what the much-lauded Tricky would be like
if he possessed brains in his head and read books, ie thought-provokingly
propulsive.
GANGER. Hailing from Perth and Glasgow, Ganger are an intriguing blend of
old-time psychedelia and slightly less old-time Kraut-rock.
BIS. Soberingly young, this teenage male-female Scottish trio are vaguely
reminiscent of the Beastie Boys and sort of like Huggy Bear. But they're a lot
more pop-orientated than either.
DANCE: MARY BRENNAN
MARK BALDWIN. His background is essentially rooted in contemporary movement -
he danced with Rambert before beginning to choreograph for them - yet he has a
real feel for the lines and possibilities of classical ballet. the best news is
Scottish Ballet re
cently secured his talents as choreographer-in-residence.
MATTHEW BOURNE. In recent years, Bourne and his company - Adventures In Motion
Pictures - have staged radically fresh versions of such classics as The
Nutcracker and a La Sylphide set amidst Glasgow tenements.
NEVILLE CAMPBELL. As well as being a fine choreographer, he has an impressive
track record in getting projects off the ground - Phoenix Dance Company is just
one instance, more recently he was involved in new initiatives in South Africa
- so hopes are hig
h for the future of a revamped Dundee Rep Dance Company under his artistic
directorship.
DEIN PERRY. The Aussie wizard booted tap dance out of yesterday's top hat and
tails and slammed it bang up to date in denims and Blundstones. Choreographer
and leader of Tap Dogs, Perry looks set for international recognition in '96
when the company retur
ns - by popular demand - for a further stint in London.
DANCE BASE. Still located within Edinburgh's Assembly Rooms - though keen to
acquire its own premises - it represents an increasingly significant focal
point and support structure for dance-makers in the city and beyond.
ICE DANCE. The new year looks like being the year of the big ice spectacular.
Theatres across the country will hastily freeze their stages to accommodate
classic ballets and popular stories.
FASHION: JOHN DAVIDSON
NINA BOSCH. What's new in modelling? The ingenue.  In time for the
international shows last October, little Nina had her hair cut to an elfin
crop, perfectly complimentary her quirky features and gamine charm.
GUINEVERE VAN FEENUS. Who is that girl? This was the question on every fashion
editor's lips when this lass walked on to the runway at the Ghost show in New
York last November. Blonde and intriguingly hesitant, yet more curvey than
truly waiflike, Guinev
ere has the mystique of a true cover star.
JOHN GALLIANO. Time-served fashion maniac, and for the third time British
Designer of the Year, John Galliano is poised to disrupt the elegant calm of
Paris when he sends out his first Haute Couture collection for the house of
Givenchy at the later this m
onth.
JO GORDON. Every million years or so, Joan Burstein of Browns boutique in
London devotes her windows to some extraordinary fashion discovery. And right
now the low-voltage spotlights are being turned on the surreal headgear of Jo
Gordon, the hottest name
in millinery.
HARVEY NICHOLS. Is it opening? Is it not? Knightsbridge's most exclusive high
fashion store is absolutely, fabulously, definitely, maybe coming to Scotland.
Sites are all but secured in both Glasgow and Edinburgh.
TOM FORD. Suddenly Gucci is the name on the lips of every dedicated follower of
fashion. And it's all the doing of Tom Ford, the American who has in just two
seasons made Gucci the hottest, hippest thing in Italian fashion with skinny
satin shirts and vel
vet hipsters.
POLITICS: ROBBIE DINWOODIE
HELEN LIDDELL. Ms Liddell only entered Parliament in 1994. Expect her to
achieve spectacularly high office in 1996. The former newspaper industry
executive has shaken off links with doomed magnate Robert Maxwell to become the
most striking Scots talent on
the Shadow team.
NICOLA STURGEON. Absurdly young, 26, Parliamentary candidate, close friend of
by-election victor Roseanna Cunningham, and now adopted for the SNP in previous
Jim Sillars fiefdom of Govan. Irvine-born solicitor and senior party office
bearer - youth and en
ergy are her tautologous portfolios - she might not have much chance in normal
circumstances. But now that civil war has broken out in Labour ranks over the
Watson-Sarwar contest, who knows?
ADAM BRUCE. Tory high-flier of whom great things are expected. Also 26, he will
fight Liberal Democrat MP Menzies Campbell in North-East Fife at the next
General Election. Tories are calling this a target seat and predicting great
things for their man, th
e son of the Earl of Elgin.
MICHAEL MOORE. Inherits Sir David Steel's redoubt in Tweeddale. A gangling
financial wizard, he is Scottish Liberal Democrat spokesman on small business
and employment.
CATHERINE TAYLOR. Wishaw-born, this student of geography and international
relations at St Andrew's was marked out for political greatness when at the age
of 21 she was elected to the party's national executive. A definite career
high-flier. As soon as sh
e finishes her exams.
STEPHEN HENDRY. Fledgling politican, thanks to his manager embroiling him in
party politics by claiming that he would quit Scotland if Labour created a
tax-raising Parliament. Having achieved everything in snooker, Mr Hendry will
this year come out for Sc
ottish Independence and give a large proportion of his accumulated wealth to
Hearts . . . perhaps.
SCIENCE:  JOE DONNELLY
MARC ANDREESSEN. At 24, Andreessen is the founder of Netscape Communications
Corporation and developed the Mosaic Netscape Navigator. This coming year will
see a huge increase in the number of PCs and new entrants to the web. Most will
use the Andreessen
system.
BILL GATES. Last year his Microsoft Corporation's Windows 95 launch was a
world-wide event. A substantial proportion of PCs use the Windows system or its
predecessors.
DAN GOLDIN. Space is more accessible these days thanks to Goldin, whose job, as
head of NASA is to keep space missions going. In 1996, Goldin's team will
achieve a rendezvous with the giant asteroid Eros which passes close to the
earth in February. There
will also be two trips to survey and land on Mars.
TOM McEWAN. An engineer at Lawrence Livermore Labs in the US, McEwan developed
a tiny, cheap radar which uses hardly any power.
OLIVER PEEBLES. A recombinant DBNA specialist from Slammanan, he has developed
a new way of manufacturing plastic. He uses transgenic bacteria to manufacture
polymers which are quite easily turned into biodegradable plastic.
Dr DAVID FLINT. Dr Flint, of the Hannah Research Institute in Ayr, has
developed cells which manufacture antibodies to destroy fat. The cells work in
the same way as immunisation, and a single dose can reduce fat by up to 30% as
a treatment for obese peop
le
JAZZ: ALISON KERR
DIANA KRALL. Harry Connick Jr is old hat: Canadian Krall is the new pretender
to the young glam pianist-singer throne.
THE GLASGOW JAZZ CO-OP. This organisation was set up by members of the former
Glasgow Society of Musicians. In 1995 they put their money where their mouths
were with four successful concerts featuring out-of-town musicians, who would
otherwise not have ha
d a platform in Glasgow.
NATIONAL JAZZ INSTITUTE. This new venture, based at Jordanhill College is to be
Scotland's answer to the USA's celebrated Berklee College. Former Berklee
student Tommy Smith was instrumental in devising the course, and the support of
other big names like
the American vibes player Gary Burton has also been promised. The course begins
in January.
ZEPHYR. Retired businessman John Bune decided to use the money he'd made on the
Stock Market to invest in his favourite jazz pianist, the superb Brian Lemon.
He set up a record company called Zephyr, and gave Lemon carte blanche when it
came to choosing s
idemen and tunes.
NAIRN INTERNATIONAL JAZZ FESTIVAL. Inspired by the film Jazz on a Summer's Day,
local businessman Ken Ramage has been organising world class jazz concerts in
beautiful surroundings for two years now.
DAVE MILLIGAN. This piano-playing Borders boy has already impressed both the
jazz and folk communities; establishing himself on the Scottish music scene not
only as a soloist and an accompanist to such stars as Scott Hamilton, but also
as co-leader of the
folk group Bachue Cafe.
ART: CLARE HENRY
DAMIAN HIRST. The sheep and shark showman, who performs in the arena of
taxidermy, made his name and #20,000 at the Turner Prize. But is it art?
MATTHEW DALZIELL and LOUISE SCULLION. Scotland's answer to the Venice Biennale
this year presented a work called Sargassum which you can see at Glasgow's CCA
until January 28. Their next works will appear in Lyon, France, and beside the
M8.
DEJAN SUDJIC. The newly appointed director of Glasgow Capital of Architecture
and Design 1999, whose name we will all have to learn how to say and spell.
ADRIAN WISZNIEWSKI. He is a busy bee, currently juggling six - or is it seven?
- commissions, including two paintings for Liverpool Cathedral, a portrait of
the three Citizens' directors (on view in Glasgow's People Palace), the
restaurant walls of Glasgo
w's Gallery of Modern Art, and a book by George MacKay Brown.
JULIE ROBERT. Scotland's first winner of the SAC British School at Rome
scholarship, has left us for a year's dolce vita.
MONET. He took Chicago by storn, causing queues around the block by 8am. At
least 900,000 people visited his exhibition, the biggest and best America has
ever seen...... and perhaps the last of its kind ever.
THEATRE: MARK FISHER
DAVID HARROWER. This young playwright has wasted no time in making his mark.
His debut drama, the sparse, linguistically precise Knives in Hens, went down a
treat on a tour of the Highlands and Islands in the summer.
KATHRYN HOWDEN. Winner of a Herald Angel award for her role in the Traverse
Theatre's Bondagers, Howden has proved herself a tremendously versatile
performer.
STEWART LAING. One of the Citizens' Theatre's stable of
designers-turned-directors, Laing attracted attention for Strindberg's The
Father, followed by an unsettling version of the little-known Sicilian play The
She Wolf. But all of this is as nothing comp
ared to the $17m musical he is going to stage on Broadway in 1996.
NICOLA McCARTNEY. Her 1995 Mayfest production of her own play, Easy, about date
rape demonstrated an ear for everyday language as well as a readiness to
address sensitive issues. KENNY MILLER. The name may be familiar but the
occupation could change. The
Citizens' Theatre design boss flexed his directorial muscle for the first time
on a well-received studio production of Look Back in Anger in November and now
he's ready for more in the director's chair.
ANTHONY NEILSON. Son of actor/director Sandy, he has established a reputation
for writing tough, uncompromising and explicit scripts for the stage and
screen. His play Penetrator was recently revived at the Tron, which has also
commissioned a new one from
him.

<HEADLINE>Sack for engineer who came up short on #4.5m building</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974635165</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CONSTRUCTION site engineer was sacked after the length of a #4.5m building
was found to be 14 millimetres short.
Mrs Michelle Morgan, who lost her claim of unfair diswmissal by Renfrew-based
Amec Construction Scotland Ltd, also failed to allow properly for the slope of
the site, an industrial tribunal in Glasgow heard.
She had been working on the Molecular Medicine Centre, a six-storey building at
Western General Hospital and Edinburgh University.
Mrs Morgan, who surveyed the site before construction work began, complained
about staff shortages. She was promoted from assistant site engineer to site
engineer during the project.
Three months later, the client's architect complained about engineering
standards. A meeting was held about lack of progress, poor workmanship, and
poor management.
Mrs Morgan accepted she was responsible for errors, including failing to make
sufficient compensation for the slope in setting out the original base line.
She claimed she had been expected to carry out too many duties when she had
first been allocated to
the contract.
Mrs Morgan was given a written warning but further investigation by the
company's senior engineers revealed the extent and consequences of these errors.
She was called to a disciplinary interview, where she accepted she had made
certain errors, including a mistake in the length of the building. She admitted
it was 14mm short. She said she had discussed the matter with the quality
assurance manager and the
y decided not to report it in the hope the error could be ``ironed out'' as the
construction proceeded.
She said some of the problems had been caused while she was on holiday and she
blamed inefficient contractors.
However, she was sacked for failing to carry out her duties as site engineer
competently and accurately, failing to report an error in the designed length
of the building, and colluding with a colleague to conceal the error.
The tribunal said it was satisfied that, faced with an extremely irate client
on a prestigious contract worth #4.5m, the company, having investigated the
issue thoroughly, was entitled reasonably to conclude there had been
significant failures on the part
of Mrs Morgan in the setting-out process and it was entitled to dismiss her.
The tribunal ruled that Mrs Morgan of Dumbarton Road, Old Kilpatrick, was not
unfairly dismissed and rejected her complaint.

A GENERAL safety certificate for Tynecastle Park, the home of Heart of
Midlothian Football Club, has been extended to include continued use of its
seating until the end of this season.
Lothian Regional Council said yesterday it had wanted Hearts legally to agree
to build a new stand by Sunday, December 31, but was now satisfied the club had
sufficiently progressed the planning for the stand.
The council also agreed to sell a former technical block at Norton Park,
Edinburgh, to Hibernian Football Club for conversion to office space.

AMERICAN maxi yacht Sayonara won the Sydney-to-Hobart bluewater classic but
missed out on breaking the race record that has stood for 20 years.
Sayonara, owned and skippered by American computer billionaire Larry Ellison
and with media magnate Rupert Murdoch aboard as a crew member, arrived at
Hobart's Constitution Dock shortly before 3am yesterday.
The race record of 2days 14hr 36min 56sec for the 720-mile journey down the
east coast of Australia was set by American skipper Jim Kilroy in Kialoa III in
1975. The Bruce Farr-designed Sayonara missed it by almost 10 hours.
Light winds yesterday meant Sayonara advanced only 25 nautical miles in eight
hours. Ellison described the race as the ``most terrifying and frustrating'' of
his career.
Crossing turbulent Bass Strait when winds gusted at up to 45 knots was the
terrifying part, while ``looking at the lights of Tasmania for six hours and
not seeing them move'' was the most frustrating.
Australian maxi Brindabella was runner-up for the second successive year - two
hours behind.

Sarajevo, Friday
US ARMY engineers are racing against a deadline of noon tomorrow to complete a
bridge over a flood-swollen river, the last link in a route for thousands of
American troops to enter Bosnia.
A double pontoon bridge spanning the 300yd-wide Sava river separating Croatia
and Bosnia is said to be their biggest such project since the Second World War.
After winter storms and floods turned military camps into a muddy quagmire, the
engineers' commander today ordered the bridge to be in place by midday tomorrow.
It will plug a gap in a military corridor to bring nearly 20,000 American
troops from bases in Germany to Bosnia to help implement the Dayton peace
accord.
The Americans will roll across the steel and aluminium floating bridge in
tanks, trucks, and armoured cars to their base at Tuzla in north Bosnia.
The US contingent will make up one-third of the Nato-led peace Implementation
Force (Ifor), whose commander, Admiral Leighton Smith, said today he was
convinced that Bosnians wanted an end to their savage 43-month  conflict.
In Banja Luka, the biggest town held by separatist Bosnian Serbs, he said: ``We
are extraordinarily encouraged by what we see. I am absolutely convinced that
the people of this country want peace.''
Banja Luka was once dubbed a ``heart of darkness'' because of heavy ``ethnic
cleansing'', the forcible expulsions by Serbs of Muslim and Croat civilians
from the area.
General William Nash, chief of the US contingent to Ifor, flew to the
bridgehead near Zupanja in Croatia today.
``The bridge is going to go in tomorrow,'' he said. ``Pat, we've gotta make it
happen now,'' he told rear commander General Pat O'Neal.
Work on the bridge - actually two, to allow traffic in both directions - ground
to a halt yesterday when the swollen Sava burst its banks.
Today, however, General Nash ordered four Chinook helicopters to start dropping
bridge sections into the fast-flowing river, which were then built up on both
sides for connecting together tomorrow.
Admiral Smith held two hours of talks with Mayor Predrag Radic and the vice
president of the so-called Bosnian Serb assembly, Nikola Koljevic.
He said the admiral had promised security for Serbs in Sarajevo and elsewhere,
who fear for their safety when the areas they occupy come under Muslim-led
government control under the peace pacts.
Serbs are already fleeing the capital, some taking their dead with them, and
many say they will set fire to their homes rather than let Muslims occupy them.
Koljevic told reporters he was confident there would be no return to
war.-Reuter.

STRATHCLYDE'S chief constable, Leslie Sharp, jetted out of Glasgow eight days
ago for a pre-retirement break in the sun with his wife and stepped back on to
the tarmac yesterday as Sir Leslie, to face a posse of newsmen.
He obviously knew the honour was in the post but he was patently not prepared -
probably for the first time in the last four and a half years - for the media
reception. Within minutes he was relaxed and enjoying the limelight,
wisecracking with a press co
rps he had won to his cause.
``I did not think this would happen for me because for various reasons I have
never been president of the chief officers' association in Scotland and I am
retiring early. Having said that I am very pleased,'' he said.
``It is good to have your work recognised but people should remember there were
25,000 officers in the Met, 6000 in West Midlands, 1200 in Cumbria and 7000 in
Strathclyde, and chief constables get to the top on the backs of others. It is
the work of all t
hese people which is being recognised. The chief gets the sack if things go
wrong and the kudos if things go right. In the last four and a half years in
Strathclyde I think things have gone right.''
Sir Leslie, 59, said he and his wife Audrey had decided to snatch a last minute
holiday to become used to the idea of retirement after 40 years in the police.
He plans to leave office at midnight in George Square on Hogmanay ``with a
glass in my hand''.
``I believe that my time here has been a success,'' he added.
``I do believe Strathclyde is a better place to live now than it was when I
arrived.''
When asked if he had any advice for his successor, Mr John Orr, Sir Leslie
said: ``John Orr is a very experienced officer and needs no advice from me. I
would say to him that the key for the right hand top drawer is in the left hand
drawer because the rig
ht hand one does not lock.''

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Lasse Kjus yesterday won the men's World Cup downhill in Italy and
later claimed he tried not to think about the overall competition,
concentrating instead on each race as it came along.
Kjus won in a time of one minute 55.35 seconds from Andreas Schifferer, of
Austria, second in 1-55.66, with Canada's Ed Podivinsky third in 1-55.86.
The Canadian said that Kjus's downhill win was likely to force some of the top
racers in the discipline to change their training programmes over the summer.
``I think the future of downhilling is to be more technically proficient, like
the Norwegians are now,'' he said. ``I think a lot of skiers will be doing more
technical training over the summer.''
Podivinsky, only twenty-eighth fastest in Thursday's final training session,
said he had then exchanged his skis for ones more suitable to ice. ``I cared
more about remaining on the course than speed,'' said Podivinsky, the 1994
Olympic downhill bronze me
dallist.
``This was the most difficult course we have raced in the last two years,'' he
added. ``It's amazing Bormio could hold a race with no snow in the valley.''
Schifferer, just 21 and in his first World Cup season, seemed as surprised as
anyone to be on the podium after starting a distant thirty-fifth. He had been
sixth in Val d'Isere after a poor debut race in Vail and then was too tense in
Val Gardena.
Leading finishers: 1, L Kjus (Norway) 1min 55.35sec; 2, A Schifferer (Austria)
1-55.66; 3, E Podivinsky (Canada) 1-55.86. British: 30, G Bell 1-58.30; 50, A

Nations Cup standings: 1, Austria 5089; 2, Switzerland 3040; 3, Italy 2227.
q SWEDEN'S Pernilla Wiberg yestrday picked up where she left off before
Christmas by winning her second consecutive World Cup slalom at Semmering in
Austria.
The 25-year-old Swede, after a frustrating start to her season, showed that she
has definitely found her form by powering her way down the Hirschenkogel course
in a two-run combined time of 1min 40.28sec. It was her thirteenth career
victory and her secon
d in a row.
Switzerland's Karin Roten used the fastest time of the second run to vault from
fifth to second, registering her first World Cup podium finish with 1-41.20.
Austria's Elfi Eder, winner of the first two slaloms of the season, took third
in 1-41.78, much to
the delight of the partisan crowd lining the sun-drenched course.
Leading finishers: 1, P Wiberg (Sweden) 1min 40.28sec; 2, K Roten (Switzerland)
1-41.20; 3, E Eder (Austria) 1-41.76. British: E Carrick-Anderson did not
qualify for second run.
Leading slalom standings: 1, Eder 260pt; 2, Wiberg 200; 3, U Hrovat (Slovenia)
192.

MICHAL Pilarski is an increasingly rare phenomenon among his fellow members of
the British Alpine Ski Team.
While more skiers of his age graduate to the team from spells with academies in
the USA, Norway, Austria, or France, Pilarski - who has almost halved his world
ranking in only seven starts since joining the Hanson &amp; Robertson British FIS
team in the summe
r - is a truly home bred skier.
Personal bests in his most recent races in North America are the fruits of
tough summer training. Now he is hopeful of reaching the World's top 350 to
achieve Europa Cup qualification from his next series of European FIS races
early in the new year.
At just 18, he has a second tilt at the World Junior championships in
Switzerland in March in his sights, and believes he can achieve Britain's best
men's result of recent years, and a place in the top 15 in his preferred
discipline, the slalom.
His domestic targets include wins at the British Junior championships in Tignes
later that month, and to establish himself as one of Britain's top three men's
technical disciplines skiers.
Falkirk-based Pilarski took his first infant steps on skis on the local 100
metres or so of dry slope matting at Polmonthill.
If he has lacked the solid seasons on snow that schooling abroad offers, his
success to date and his impressive potential are a testament to elements of the
coaching set-up of Aberdeen Ski Club, who have pioneered long-term summer camps
on the Alpine glac
iers and a strong foundation in the most up-to-date techniques.
``I never let the fact that I have not been abroad to a ski academy bother
me,'' said Pilarski, who was tops in all three disciplines at last year's
British Junior championships. ``I knew it was always going to be the case.
``Now I have the opportunity to ski full time I'm not going to miss any
chances.''
Long term, his targets are the 1998, or realistically, the 2002 Olympics and a
place on the World Cup tour.

<TEXT>
IRELAND'S Deputy Prime Minister, Dick Spring, yesterday joined calls for Sinn
Fein to condemn terrorist-linked killings in Belfast.
He said the recent shootings - claimed to have been carried out by an
anti-drugs group with IRA connections - were ``a worrying feature in the whole
context of the Northern Ireland peace process''.
Mr Spring, who is Ireland's foreign minister and a key figure in political
developments surrounding the peace process, added: ``Reports from the security
forces would seem to point to paramilitary organisations.
``These incidents are obviously a worry. Whether or not they destabilise the
peace process remains to be seen. We would hope they would not continue.''
Asked in an Irish radio interview whether he would like to see the murders
condemned by Sinn Fein, Mr Spring said: ``I would like to see them condemned by
everybody.
``They are totally unacceptable, an affront to civilised society and, at the
end of the day, they are not going to contribute to what we all want to achieve
- the establishment of peace and democratic politics for the whole island.''
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was under growing pressure yesterday to use his
influence to stop the killings and punishment beatings.
Alliance Party deputy leader Seamus Close said: ``As a leader, Gerry Adams must
lead and ensure that there are no more dead bodies or broken bones, no more
widows or orphans.''
The latest victim of the killer gangs, father-of-two Martin McCrory, 30, who
was shot in his Belfast home as he cradled his baby son in his arms on
Wednesday night, will be buried today.

FROM the National Insurance contribution (NIC) point of view, the Budget was
remarkable for what did not happen. In the run-up to the Chancellor's
pronouncement, rumours abounded that all taxable benefits in kind would become
subject to employers' NIC, cu
rrently 10%. As it turned out, the topic did not rear its ugly head at all, but
it may be a matter we will need to come back to.
The mis-match in treatment of NIC and PAYE on benefits in kind will not survive
what seems to be the inevitable closer working of the Inland Revenue and the
Contributions Agency. It is not only administratively inconvenient; it is a
revenue raising opport
unity going abegging. So if the Conservative Party does not cotton on to this,
Labour undoubtedly will.
Historically, benefits in kind are not included in pay for NIC purposes
because, when the legislation was first framed in the early sixties for the
graduated contributions scheme, they consisted of such things as free coal to
miners, the provision of boar
d and lodgings to farm workers and free canteen facilities for company staff.
There was no wish to impose an NIC liability on these and similar items.
There was also the problem of valuation. NIC liabilities traditionally arise at
the time of payment, and employers would have needed instant valuations and
that was simply impractical if not impossible.
This hurdle has been eliminated to some extent by the introduction of the class
1A system of collecting employer contributions on company cars and fuel after
the end of the relevant tax year.
Benefits are now a regular feature of remuneration packages and for a
considerable number of employees they are of a significant value. But since
they are taxable there is no real logic in leaving them NIC-free.
The payment of NICs was not an important or costly issue until October 1985
when the ceiling on employers' contributions was removed. Previously they did
not have to pay NIC on wages above a certain limit, but the Government raised
billions of pounds by r
emoving this.
Since then, a large number of schemes have been developed using more and more
exotic means to avoid paying employers' NIC - predominantly in relation to
bonus payments.
The Contributions Agency has always been one or two steps behind these so, for
example, it legislated against bonuses paid in gilts in 1988, and those paid
through unit trusts or by way of certain life assurance policies in 1991. More
recently, it acted o
n gold bullion in December 1993, and gemstones and fine wine from August 1994.
Finally, from April this year, no doubt suffering from a high degree of
frustration, it has attempted to make any assets for which trading arrangements
exist liable to NIC.
Each of these moves, of course, came about only after much use of each specific
scheme.
Very few ``fat cats'' who were receiving large bonuses tended to keep fine
wines, gemstones or gold bullion. Instead, they encashed these and not only
avoided NIC but also didn't have to account for tax on the value for some time
after the tax year.
It was thought the agency had tired of this cat-and-mouse game and that the
present schemes using increasingly complex arrangements might have rattled it.
It was strongly felt it would take back the initiative and state that all
benefits in kind were subj
ect to NIC with possibly one or two minor exceptions, such as luncheon and
healthcare vouchers.
It had the Inland Revenue legislation and well-established procedures relating
to the payment of tax on benefits to help it. A class 1A type of contribution
would not have placed too great an administrative burden on employers who are
already going to hav
e to provide a lot of the information required for self-assessment tax
purposes. However, we heard nothing.
Perhaps, politically, it was too difficult to introduce what would, in effect,
be an expansion of the tax system to cover these benefits in kind and would hit
middle and higher income earners.
However, this leaves the UK with one of the cheapest social security systems in
Europe and we are almost unique in not charging contributions on all payments,
including benefits in kind.
In that sense, the Budget lived up to the Chancellor's claim that Britain is
the ``enterprise centre of Europe''. It is a significant saving for companies
with employees moving around the continent if they have a 10% social security
cost on only cash item
s rather than, for examaple, around 40% on all emoluments which can be due in
France, Belgium and Italy. With that in mind, perhaps we should drink to small
mercies!

FRANCE and the United States have given the Hopman Cup a boost, stepping in to
replace Sweden and Ukraine who have withdrawn from the mixed team tournament in
Perth.
Sweden pulled out earlier this week after former world No.1 Mats Wilander
suffered a back injury.
The US and France have filled the last two places in group A behind Croatians
Goran Ivanisevic and Iva Majoli, and South Africans Wayne Ferreira and Amanda
Coetzer.
American pair Richey Reneberg and Chanda Rubin open their campaign on Monday
against South Africa, while Croatia take on the French pair, Arnaud Boetsch and
Catherine Tanvier.
Group B has three of the biggest servers in men's tennis - Richard Krajicek of
the Netherlands, Switzerland's Marc Rosset and Mark Philippoussis of Australia.
Krajicek and Brenda Schultz-McCarthy are seeded at the top of the group, ahead
of Rosset and teenage prodigy Martina Hingis.
Philippoussis and Nicole Bradtke are next, ahead of defending champions
Germany, weakened by the unavailability of world No.4 Boris Becker.

n THE most honest answer you can give to anyone who asks you how you're keeping
warm this winter is, simply, that you are not. Everybody is frozen. Frosted
panes and burst pipes plague a struggling nation. Some people are scared of
putting the heating off
in case the bath fills up. Others are scared to put it on because it costs.
Scotland, currently, is as cold as Moscow and just as carefree. From
warehousemen, farmers, and Big Issue vendors, to lawyers, politicians, and
housewives, all are equal in their
suffering. Here, a few members of the public give away their secrets for
combating lower temperatures. Needs must, it's time to pitch in together.
n What's the best way to keep warm? Body heat - David Ewing, Supervisor
n We've got a Calor gas heater in the back room, we take turns to run in and
get a heat - Janice, city centre shop assistant
n I've tried to keep wearing a suit to work, but it's just not warm enough. I
don't have any thermals, so I've got a jumper over my shirt and tie all the
time - John Lewis, office clerk
n When I was broke and couldn't afford to buy a Powercard to stick in my meter,
I burned newspapers in my kitchen sink to heat up the house. I'm thinking of
doing that again - Jim Meek, unemployed
n Exercise - Gillian Peters, trainer
n How do I keep warm? I've borrowed my boss's fan heater - she's on holiday -
and I've plugged it in under my desk - Sarah McPherson, secretary
n By not coming in to The Herald - Colleague David Belcher complaining about
the working temperature
n Eat a lot, keep yourself stoked up with fuel, lots of soup and stodge -
Michael Robb, barman
n Get a dog. Cats are no good unless you skin them - Kate Smart, manageress
n You lose 75% of body heat through your head, so always wear a hat. And wear
layers of clothing rather than one heavy outfit - Herald Fashion Editor John
Davidson
n Bring the duvet through from the bedroom and curl up in front of the fire -
Kirsty Wilson, hairdresser
n Have a hug - Steven Urquhart, romantic
n Stay off work - Jim McAlpine, bookie
n If you were out on exercise you would find a hollow, perhaps under a ridge,
or a natural dugout, and you would lie down there, out of the wind. It's the
wind that kills. On the other hand, in snow you must never lie down, or stop,
you must keep moving o
r you will freeze to death - Anonymous TA Officer
n A real log fire and a furry rug - Ailsa Cunninghame, nurse
n I always wear at least three pairs of woolly socks and a big pair of boots.
If your feet are warm the rest of you is too - Naseem Ahmad, grocer
n Stay in bed with someone you love - Margaret Norris, department store customer
n A plate of porridge in the morning - Sauchiehall Street pedestrian
n Well you could always go abroad someplace nice, like that Princess Di off to
Antigua, if you had the same money - Joe McNulty, fruiterer

SCOTLAND'S new breed of millionaires got even richer during 1995. A study of
the performance of the shares of top Scottish firms has revealed Stagecoach
heads the listing for the second year in a row.
The last 12 months have seen the brother and sister partnership of Brian Souter
and Ann Gloag add more than #80m to their personal wealth as shares in the
Perth-based company soared. That works out at a staggering #1.5m a week between
them, or #225,000 a
day.
And the Wiseman brothers will no doubt be toasting in 1996 with a pinta as
shares in their East Kilbride-based dairy business shot up to net the trio a
cool #25m.
But whisky firms will be glad to see the back of 1995. Producers of two of the
biggest brands - Famous Grouse and The Macallan - topped the list of
under-performers. The reduction in duty in the Chancellor's November Budget
should help in 1996.
The study, conducted by Edinburgh stockbroker Tilney &amp; Co, shows that shares in
Stagecoach accelerated from 225p at the beginning of January to 354p by the end
of the year. That rise out-performed the FTSE All-Share index by 27%. It also
took the market v
alue of Stagecoach, Britain's biggest bus operator, up by more than #190m to
nearly #530m.
Brian Souter, the firm's 41-year-old bus conductor turned executive chairman,
and his sister Ann Gloag, a nurse turned managing director, cashed in as they
are the two main shareholders. Mr Souter, who holds a 23.4% stake, added #44.8m
to his wealth takin
g the total value of his share in the business to #123.7m. Ms Gloag, who has
19.6%, gained #37m which took her stake to #103.6m.
``The shares analysis continues to prove that the wealthy can only get
wealthier,'' said Bill McCall, director with Tilney &amp; Co.
The stockbroking firm said most of the surge had come towards the end of the
year, following Stagecoach being awarded the contract to run Britain's largest
rail franchise - South West Trains.
The Royal Bank of Scotland was a close second in the performance stakes. Over
1995 its share price rose from 393p to 586p, out-performing the market by 23%.
Mr McCall said: ``This was mainly due to Scotland's biggest bank announcing
record profits earlier
in the year, and then becoming the subject of intense takeover speculation
towards the year-end.''
The Dundee-based food retailer Watson &amp; Philip shared second slot, with a 172p
rise in its shares over the year to 535p allowing it also to out-perform the
market by 23%.
Wiseman Dairies took fourth slot, with a 45p rise in its share price from 103p
to 148p. Its shares showed growth of 20% relative to the market. This rapid
rise added #35.2m to the value of the company - controlled by three brothers -
over 1995.
Alan Wiseman, the 44-year-old chairman who holds a 37% stake, gained #13m in
personal wealth, taking the total value of his share to #41m. Robert Wiseman,
aged 40, is managing director. He has a 31% share, which rose #10.9m over the
year to just under #35
m. Gavin Wiseman, the 38-year-old director who holds a 5.1% stake, saw his
share jump #1.8m to #5.6m.
Cairn Energy, the relatively unknown Edinburgh-based oil and gas exploration
company, was the fifth-best perfoming Scottish share. During 1995 its price
rose from 82p to 117p, allowing it to out-performed the market by 18%.
At the other end of the scale, 1995 was not a good year for whisky firms with
the price war squeezing margins as they battled desperately for market share.
Highland Distilleries which produces Famous Grouse, the second best selling UK
brand, has the unenviable record of being the biggest sinner. Its shares
plunged 120p to 323p - under-performing the market average by minus 38%.
Howden, based in Renfrew, reflected the pressures in the engineering sector as
it under-performed the market by minus 36% with a drop in share price over the
year from 93p to 67p.
Weir Group echoed its sector's slump as shares in Scotland's biggest
engineering firm dropped 67p from 213p.
Macallan-Glenlivet, which produces The Macallan also had a tough time. Its
shares tumbled from 211p to 190p.
Edinburgh Fund Managers was the fifth worst performer. Doubts over its future
ownership resulted in its shares falling 71p to 658p.

Jonathon Wills tries to pinpoint the best time to celebrate New Year and
decides any date can be a good excuse for a party
WHY is New Year when it is? Jews and Muslims don't celebrate it on January 1.
Nor do the Chinese. They pick more sensible dates, when there's some serious
evidence that the northern hemisphere really is recovering from winter. Until
1600.AD Scotland did t
he same. The civil and legal New Year was in March, when shoots of green were
re-appearing in more sheltered spots. In England they didn't change over to
January 1 until 1752.
Europe, ahead of the game as usual, had switched in the 16th century, when Pope
Gregory's men of science worked out that the old Julian calendar, drawn up by
one C.J Caesar (101-44 BC), had miscalculated the time it takes for the Sun to
complete one orbit
of the Earth. During a millenium and a half, this had put the clocks forward
by 10 days and a bit. Pope Gregory's boffins solved the problem by turning
October 5, 1582 into October 15, 1582. Bingo! They were back in sync with the
solar system.
Not us, though. Julius Caesar might once have united Europe, single currency
and all, but that had fallen to bits in 455.AD, when Rome was first-footed by
the Vandals. By 1582 even the Pope's writ no longer ran in England or Scotland,
what with the Reform
ation and all that.
Euro-sceptical Protestants were naturally a tad suspicious of some Italian
Godfather in a funny hat and a frock presuming to shorten their natural span by
10 days, which is what they assumed His Holiness intended.
Now, you can have a lot of fun in 10 days, getting rich, drunk, and begetting
heirs to the throne and what not. People over here didn't want to miss out on
10 whole days of that, especially with not having to go to Confession any more,
and who can blame t
hem? They might have missed New Year on March 1, for Heaven's sake!
Just as will happen with the new single currency, the offshore islanders
eventually fell into line and celebrated on the proper ``New Style'' date. On
Britain's own offshore islands, such as Shetland, resistance to changing the
calendar was even more mark
ed and prolonged.
On Foula (population 40), some people still celebrate Christmas and New Year on
the old style dates but, being Foula, they do it 12 days later, not 10. Until
the telephone and the Internet came along, it could take a while for messages
to reach Foula and
sometimes they were garbled.
Twenty years ago, when I lived in Unst, Britain's most northerly inhabited
island, we had it both ways. We celebrated Christmas, or Yule, on December 25,
New Year (or Newerdy) on January 1, ``Aald Yule'' on January 6 and ``Aald
Newerdy'' on January 11 or
12 or 13, depending on how well we'd recovered from Aald Christmas. The Unst
men liked a good celebration, although some of the womenfolk were less than
approving, and four opportunities to get a good dram in were better than two.
Lord knows there are few signs in a Shetland January, whatever date you pick,
that our sleet-blasted heath will ever sprout again. The worst of the winter is
still to come. There's no new grass until the middle of May and snow squalls
can hit us in the fi
rst week of June.
Until the men of science came along, priests, charlatans and mothers-in-law
were always propagating the dreadful fear that the Sun might not make another
orbit, if the Great Godfather in the Sky decided to punish the punters,
particularly the sons-in-law
, for their wickedness. True, it always had come back, but you never knew and
you never could tell, so you kept up the payments to the shamans who said they
knew how to make the necessary arrangements.
That's where Yule came in, long before the Christian shamans started up their
own fear-full racket, which shows no sign of waning despite over a century of
compulsory education.
My own theory is that Yule was nothing to do with New Year, particularly in the
far north. In pre-Christian times it was a time to light bonfires and torches
to scare off the evil ones, tempt the Sun back from the other side of the hill,
and also to sacri
fice stuff, say you're sorry and it won't happen again, and have a good
blowout. We are talking fertility rites and insurance policies here. People had
no idea whether it had worked until the spring - the real New Year - arrived.
Christmas, Hogmanay and the midwinter fire festivals which once were held all
over Scotland are basically the old Yule bolted onto new calendars and
religions. This is thoroughly confusing; some Eurocrat is probably working on a
scheme to standardise it a
ll. But there's no chance it can ever be sorted out at this late date, whatever
happens to British Summer Time. Just as well, because the duplicated,
overlapping celebrations make British winter time so much easier to bear.
Budget Day may have moved from March to November but the tax collectors still
follow their ancient, pagan calendar. Ever wondered why the income tax year
starts in early April? It's because by then they're pretty confident, as they
always have been, that
there actually will be a new crop of bannocks, salt beef, whisky, coal and salt
to get their dirty claws into. I must have been four and a half when first
woken up to bring in the New Year (New Style). My mother carried me to the
doorstep. It was cold, ev
en wrapped in a blanket. The sky was all stars. A church clock chimed down in
the village. I was grumpy, as I still am when roused from a deep sleep.
I couldn't see what all the fuss was about but at least my parents were both
being jolly at the same time, a pleasant change from the usual festive season
rows. Before I was put back to bed I had a symbolic slice of black bun, which
had arrived from Shetl
and in the post before Christmas. More importantly, my father gave me five bob,
a small fortune in 1952.
That was in Wheatley, Oxfordshire, where most people didn't even stay up for
The Bells. There were no first-footers. That was the trouble, as far as my
Lerwick-born mother was concerned. She liked living in England but around
Hogmanay she liked it less an
d pined for ``home''. That was the time of year when she indulged in what was
then a spectacular extravagance - long-distance telephone calls to Shetland.
At No 2 Russell Crescent, Lerwick, 600 miles away, there would be the usual
wild party in progress. A succession of jolly relatives came to the phone, to
bellow ``Happy New Year!'' and say things like ``Yus, yus, wir aa fine, foo's
du Caathie, an da man a
n da bairns?'' and ``Whit a terrible nicht o' wadder'' and then the three
minutes would be up for another 12 months.
It was another 11 years before my first Shetland Hogmanay, at the Lerwick
Market Cross. It was amazing: a huge street party with hundreds of people
roaring, kissing, cheering and swigging out of half bottles of each others' and
God knows who else's whisky
. In no time at all I was drunk for the first time in my life.
Our gang of teenagers ended up on the Orsk, a water tanker for the Soviet
fishing fleet, where we were obliged to eat a mess of cabbage, garlic custard
and onions, down glasses of the comrades' vodka in a wannie and, at the
commissar's insistence, watch a
two-hour, flickering film about the heroic shock workers of the Uzbekistan
cotton fields. That fairly sobered you up.
We escaped from the Orsk around four in the morning, pursued for some distance
along the docks by the second mate, a Kaliningrader who wanted ``jurst waan
moor keez'' from my pal's girlfriend. Then we went first-footing on shore. I
must have passed out so
me time after eight. I awoke behind a sofa in a strange house at teatime, with
no idea where I was, feeling hellish and deeply ashamed. But no-one seemed to
have noticed. They were getting ready for more first footing and, after ``a
peerie moothlifter'',
by golly, I went with them.
In England, Christmas had been the big deal. In Shetland, it was New Year. Or
so I thought, until I took part in my first Up Helly A'. It means, roughly
translated, ``The Mother of All Parties''. The famous torchlit procession and
burning of the replica N
orse galley (now with added fireworks in these affluent times) are but the
beginning of an all-nighter to end all-nighters.
Up Helly A' is Christmas and New Year rolled into one. In its modern form it is
only a century old but its origins pre-date Christianity. It was and remains
the final fling of the Yule carousing season which, at this high latitude,
lasts for over a month,
from Christmas Eve until the awful morning after the last Tuesday in January.
Up Helly A' is a sub-arctic Mardi Gras, an enormous booze-up organised with
military precision. It has been organised by worthy burghers, rightly and
tightly so, ever since serious Up Helly A' rioting in Lerwick was suppressed in
the late 19th century - w
hen drunken plebs used to pull blazing tar barrels on sledges through the
streets and leave them on the doorsteps of the previous year's least popular
worthy burgher, for Heavens' sake!
Up Helly A' purists like to think their festival is unique; in fact, it is just
a fiercely burning relic of a tradition whose smouldering embers encircle the
northern quarter of the globe. Other midwinter festivals are being revived as
the clammy hands of
57 varieties of kirk slip their grip and people rediscover older traditions.
Visitors who come to Shetland for Up Helly A' are often disappointed. The fiery
procession and the galley burning are sensational but the parties that follow
are strangely alienating, however welcoming the locals try to be. As 48 squads
of disguised men e
ach perform skits and costumed displays in a dozen halls in succession, the
incomer can feel a bit out of it. The jokes are in-jokes, the thousands of
jolly conversations between old friends intimate and local. The dialect is at
its most impenetrable on U
p Helly A' night.
Shetland has never seriously marketed Up Helly A' as a tourist attraction and
it probably never will. The halls are run as private parties by committees of
hosts and hostesses and the squads are their invited guests. Only a few tickets
are on sale to the
public. It is first-footing on a Viking scale but still very much a family
affair.
The trouble with Hogmanay first-footing is that etiquette demands you should
not stay too long. With all those other houses to visit in just one night, you
never have time to say everything you meant to say, which is probably just as
well, seeing the stat
e some of us get into after a dozen whiskies.
So throughout the Yule season, people all over Shetland still ``geng
hoosamilla'' (go between the houses), to visit their friends and relations at
other times and ``hae a richt nicht''. This means a proper gossip lasting well
into the small hours and prob
ably until daylight, some time after 9am. Next night they'll visit the next
neighbours. And even a month is never long enough. I knew one sociable old
crofter in Unst who first-footed a neighbour as late as September.
I have spent New Year in other places and nowadays usually do - but only
because my constitution is no longer capable of lying insensible in ditches
between the houses. I've taken a turn at the Tron in Edinburgh, partied in
Fulham, fallen about in Fife, a
nd even danced in the streets of Alloa (where there is sometimes a piper).
Why do so many of us ring in the New under the influence? Possibly because if
we were completely sober we wouldn't understand what all the fuss is about.
What are we celebrating, anyway, on this arbitrary midnight when nothing, apart
from our resolutions, really changes? Well, survival, I suppose, after another
year of Tory occupation. And defiance,in the face of Labour's flight from
principle. And making
a fresh start, wiping the personal slate clean - particularly important for
Protestants who haven't got Confession. And, like Dr Samuel Johnson, we
recognise that a triumph of hope over experience seems worth at least one toast.
I am resolved to spend this New Year quietly, as Hogmanay falls on the Sabbath.
A frugal meal, possibly a small glass of port to follow vespers, and then I
shall read an improving book as we complete yet another sorry orbit. Following
a decorous domestic
scene of mutual felicitation upon the stroke of the New Year, I shall perhaps
sip a nip of Crabbie's Green Ginger Wine before retiring, 10 minutes into 1996,
to enjoy a good night's sleep, so as not to be late for matins.
The hell I will. Happy New Year!

Moscow, Friday
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin returned to the Kremlin today for the first
time since suffering acute heart trouble more than two months ago and recorded
a New Year's address to the nation.
Yeltsin, 64, strolled through the grounds of his headquarters in central Moscow
after arriving from a country residence at Barvikha, west of the capital.
Interfax said Yeltsin chatted with tourists and Muscovites in the Kremlin
grounds.
``I have come out for my first day at work in the Kremlin,'' he said when he
stopped to chat to sightseers beneath the onion domes on a snowy Cathedral
Square.
Later the presidential press service said he was in the studio recording his
New Year's message, to be broadcast on Sunday.
The president left a sanatorium at Barvikha earlier this week for his nearby
country residence, where his press service said he planned to spend the New
Year with his family.
Yeltsin was taken to hospital on October 26 suffering from what doctors
described as an ischaemic heart condition, a blood supply problem.
A month later he moved to the sanatorium where he gradually increased his
workload and received a stream of visitors.
Yeltsin's health problems have cast doubt on prospects for him standing for a
second term in a presidential election scheduled for June 16, although most
analysts expect him to run.
Today he gave few clues to his tactics for the New Year battle with a resurgent
communist opposition.
Final data released by the Central Electoral Commission today confirmed the
communists will be the strongest bloc in the new parliament which convenes on
January 16. They have 157 of 450 seats, over 100 more than their closest rivals.
Yeltsin vowed to stick to his reform course despite a strong showing by the
communists in the December 17 Duma election. However he kept the nation
guessing on whether he would stand for a second five-year term in the
presidential election next June 16.
``I am still thinking about it,'' he said, adding he would announce his
intentions at the beginning of February.
His wife Naina has voiced concern about the impact of a second term on
Yeltsin's condition. However the president has vowed to make a complete
recovery from his second bout of heart trouble in less than four months.-Reuter.

SCOTLAND will play two tests against the host country - at Carisbrook and Eden
Park - on their eight match tour of New Zealand next summer. The Scots open
against third division provincial side, Wanganui before facing Northland at
Whangerei.
The hardest match for the tourists outside the two Tests is expected to be
against Waikato.
Compared to Scotland's 1990 tour when they were undefeated in the six non-test
games, the 1996 itinerary looks marginally less arduous.
May 28 v Wanganui (Wanganui); May 31 v Northland (Whangerei); June 5 v Waikato
(Hamilton); June 8 v Southland (Invercargill); June 11 v South Island
Divisional XV (Blenheim); June 15 v New Zealand (Dundedin); June 18 v Bay of

CONSUMERS should be prepared for higher food prices in 1996, according to Jim
Reed, director-general of the United Kingdom Agricultural Supply Trade
Association. He forecasts that eggs, chicken and pork - products where feed is
the main production costs -
will be dearer in the shops.
Mr Reed warned that livestock farmers, faced with higher costs for animal
feeds, would have to recover part of the increase from the market.
``We drew attention in November to the strong upward pressure on livestock
costs resulting from higher raw material prices on the international market,''
he said. ``Throughout Europe, feed manufacturers face spiralling costs which
they have no choice but
to pass on to farmer customers.
``The EU Commission recently imposed higher cereal export levies and allowed
some imports of sorghum in the southern member states of the EU on special
terms. Partly in response to these moves, quieter trading on north European
grain markets allowed price
s to slacken a little, he added.
Although such efforts were welcome, feed grains were still #15-#20 a tonne up
on the same time last year and UKASTA sees no evidence that the escalation in
prices of high-protein ingredients is over.
``Feed manufacturers are paying an extra #50 on every tonne of soya bean meal
and rapeseed meal above the cost in August,'' explained Mr Reed. ``For
fishmeal, where supplies are sharply down, the increase is #100 a tonne.
``Feed prices will move strongly upward for several months to come and
livestock producers must look to their outlets for higher prices in return. It
is hard to avoid the conclusion that sustained upward cost pressure will affect
the whole range of livest
ock products just at the time when higher vegetable and flour prices are also
coming through.'

Brown Bros
goes East
DUMFRIESSHIRE-based meat processor Brown Brothers has doubled its turnover to
#4m this year, with the help of large sales of speciality pork to Russian
retailers.
Business at home is also booming for the family company, which has more than
doubled its workforce to nearly 50 since it moved from Biggar to larger
premises in Kelloholm 2!s years ago. Brown Brothers hopes to recruit another 30
employees next year.
During the latter part of this year, the company shipped 140 tons of cured
smoked shoulder pork to Russian retailers in 20-ton consignments. Moscow
supermarkets were among the buyers. Managing director Martyn Godfrey believes
Russia could develop into a s
ubstantial market for Brown Brothers, which also exports to Spain and Gibraltar.
Pork on menu
THE growth rate of newly-weaned pigs can be boosted by as much as 25% with
``menu'' feeding, according to Mike Baker, manager of the Meat and Livestock
Commission's pig development unit in Bedfordshire.
Rot bonus
ITALIAN potato growers, who normally deal with Dutch producers, have turned to
Britain for seed potato supplies in the wake of the outbreak of Brown Rot in
Holland. Initial supplies to the Italian market are expected to be limited but
a number of varietie
s will be going into trials in Italy next year for evaluation. The Potato
Marketing Board is considering a trade mission to Italy early in the New Year
and will also be advertising in the Italian trade press.

THE beef industry, faced with the challenge of rebuilding its image because of
the BSE controversy, is planning an important event at the National
Agricultural Centre, Stoneleigh, in March.
Farmers attending Beef for the Market will be challenged to play their part in
arresting the decline in UK home consumption which has fallen from 20kg per
person in 1987 to less than 16kg.
The Meat and Livestock Commission - one of the sponsors - will demonstrate how
it perceives beef to be positioned in the market and how it can best be
promoted and sold. It will take up the MLC advertising theme of how little fat
there is in lean beef com
pared to products that are usually thought to be leaner.
Producers will be briefed on some of the issues which have to be faced by the
retailer, including the predominance of households comprising only one or two
people, which gives rise to a demand for smaller joints and retail packs.
Another sociological factor which has affected meat sales is the changing
lifestyles of families - resulting in fewer family meals and more eating out,
which accounts for 20% of beef consumption.
It is six years since supermarkets overtook independent butchers in the league
of retail beef sales. Since Sunday opening was extended to England and Wales,
the supermarkets' share of domestic beef sales has risen to 55%.
The recent BSE scare has dented that figure at least temporarily. Scottish
experience has shown that traditional High Street butchers have suffered much
less than supermarkets. The strength of the traditional butcher shop has been
that it has staff on han
d to explain the issues and to reassure the customer.
The supermarkets will not give up their hard-won share of the beef market
lightly. They are showing enthusiasm for farm assurance schemes that guarantee
cattle welfare and the wholesomeness of home-produced beef.
One aim of the beef event will be to involve producers in meeting the demands
which are increasingly being imposed by the market. Signet - the MLC and
Scottish Agricultural College joint venture - will demonstrate the main beef
systems and identify key pr
ofit factors.
Beef consultant Dr David Allen said: ``Picking a breed suited to the beef
system is extremely important. Signet will demonstrate how important estimated
breeding values (EBVs) are to the suckled calf producer and also to the dairy
farmer buying a bull for
natural service or AI organisations buying bulls for studs.''
n JOHN Ross, president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, is also
anxious that everything possible should be done to counter the effects of the
BSE scare on meat consumption. He has described 1996 as a year of challenge for
the meat industry in t
he battle to win back the confidence of customers.

BILLY McPherson, for so long one of the mainstays of Insights Menzieshill
indoor team, yesterday came back to haunt his old club when he guided English
title-holders Old Loughtonians to victory in the Menzieshill invitation
tournament at the Dick McTaggar
t Centre in Dundee.
Over the three days Old Loughtonians were that shade better than their rivals,
although it was not until the concluding two series of games that they
eventually sealed their triumph.
They began by beating Menzieshill 6-3 on a day when the Taysiders were well
below form. Uncharacteristically, they made elementary mistakes in defence and
were deservedly overcome.
Steve Carter, Old Loughtonians' Australian striker, did most to separate
Menzieshill from the trophy when he was one of the Englishmen's early
goal-scorers as they established a 2-0 lead.
Menzieshill fought back, but they could do nothing to stop the English side,
who completed their programme with a maximum record by beating Torbrex
Wanderers 7-5, with Carter winning the top goal-scorer award with 14 strikes in
the course of the tournamen
t.
The Dundee side, by beating Wanderers 7-2, finished second, but Wanderers had
the satisfaction of producing the highest score of the day, when they beat
Touche Ross Gordonians 9-1.
The Scottish Under-21s eventually came good and finished in fifth place, which
will undoubtedly give coach Malcolm Callaghan food for thought for the
forthcoming European Junior championship. Results:
Touche Ross Gordonians 8, Bett Inns 2; Torbrex Wanderers 2, Insights
Menzieshill 7; Scottish Under-21s 4, Dita Travellers 4; Gordonians 1, Wanderers
9; Scottish Under-21s 7, Bett Inns 2; Old Loughtonians 6, Menzieshill 3;
Gordonians 4, Scottish Under-21s
3; Old Loughtonians 7, Wanderers 5; Dita Travellers 1, Menzieshill 7.
Final placings: 1, Old Loughtonians, 12 points; 2, Menzieshill 10; 3, Wanderers
8; 4, Gordonians 6; 5, Scottish Under-21s 3; 6, Dita Travellers 3; 7, Bett Inns
0.

Independent
guidance
GLASGOW-based independent financial adviser MGW is producing a guide to the new
Tessas. It will be available from January 4.
MGW's managing director Brian McKenna says: ``Unlike the guides available from
Tessa providers, it does not promote any single product. It's an independent
guide, presenting a much broader picture on Tessas, their performance and the
alternative options a
vailable to investors with maturing accounts.''
The guide goes back to basics, explaining what a Tessa is and then outlines
some of the investment options available. For a free copy telephone 0141 353
2239.
PEP advice
THE PEP Shop has issued a guide highlighting eight different investment
philosophies employed by PEP managers and recommending one PEP in each
category. A copy can be obtained free by telephoning 0115 982 5105.
BoS fixes it
BANK of Scotland has announced a new range of fixed-rate mortgages with rates
reduced by up to 1.2%. They vary from 5.95% to 8.75% depending on the length of
the fix and the loan to property value ratio.
Index option
KLEINWORT Benson private bank is issuing a Tessa with an optional link to the
FTSE-100 index, with a guarantee of no capital loss. Each year for the
five-year period the account holder chooses to receive either the bank's
standard Tessa interest rate or t
he link to the index. There is a minimum deposit of #3000 and it is available
to those with maturing existing Tessas.
Rate reduced
BRADFORD &amp; Bingley Building Society has reduced the interest rate on its
phone-based Mortgages Direct service (telephone 0800 554709) from 6.7% to 6.5%.
It claims this is the lowest rate on offer from a direct mortgage provider.
Loans are available up to
75% of valuation.
High returns
POLICY Portfolio suggests people with maturing Tessas consider investing the
proceeds in second-hand with-profits endowment policies which, it says, offer
returns equivalent to 11% to 13%. For more details call 0181 343 4567.
US guarantee
MANOR Park (telephone 01481 701108) has added the US stock market to its range
of guaranteed equity funds which provide a variety of risk/reward options. The
guarantees range from 95% of the amount invested to 100% per quarter.
The related exposure to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index goes from 355% to 80%,
for investors who want to avoid currency risk. It is slightly different for
those willing to accept this. Switches between the guarantee/exposure levels
can be made. Charges ar
e 5% initial and 0.25% quarterly.
C&amp;G choices
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester has lowered its mortgage base rate for new borrowers to
7.24% and has launched a new range of fixed-rate loans. Two-year fixes are
available at 6.29%, three years at 6.75% and five years at 7.69%. The last two

erest penalty on early redemption, with a reservation charge of #250. For the
two-year fix there is no early redemption fee but there is a reservation cost
of #500.
Interest cut
ABBEY National has reduced the rates on its personal loans by 1.5 percentage
points and they now range from 13.9% on #10,000 or more, to 20.5% on up to #950.
Royal revises

mortgages. These now vary from 5.75% for a one-year fix up to 7.75% for five
years and 8.5% for 10, for loans up to 95% of valuation. Higher loan to value
ratios carry a 1% premiu

A SURPRISE defeat for No.1 seed Lisa McKenna has left Pam Nimmo and Laura
Hamilton flying the Scottish banner in today's under-19 semi-finals of the Bank
of Scotland Scottish Junior Open at Heriot-Watt University, Riccarton.
McKenna, who had been feeling sick and came close to pulling out mid-match,
struggled from the start and  lost  9-5, 9-5, 9-2 to 18-year-old South African,

semi-final clash with
Naude. Seeded 5/8, the Heriot-Watt student upset the third favourite, Julie
Dorn-Jensen, 9-3, 9-0, 3-9, 9-2.
Hamilton, the youngest semi-finalist at 16, had the easiest passage. After a

AS a Scot who worked for 16 years in England, has had two English wives, and
has four grown-up children who consider themselves to be English, I feel I have
the right to comment on Graeme Woolaston's article, Caught in the middle of a
conflict of identiti
es (December 28).
I sympathise with him. As he says, Scotland and England are very different
countries; ``divided by a common language'' like Britain and America, in the
words of George Bernard Shaw.
Yet in his detailed comments he contradicts that sensible judgment. There is no
point whatever in saying to the Scots, ``You lost your independence - get over
it!'' They can't. There's the rub.
For 50 years they've been driving towards greater autonomy and nothing is going
to stop them.
The fact that 350,000 inhabitants of Scotland were born in England makes the
Scottish people fear for their identity: 16% of the Borders, and 10% of the
Orkney and Western Isles populations are English.
Just the other day a charming 30-year-old Glasgow social worker told me how
shocked she and her husband had been when on Skye nearly everyone they spoke to
was English. She thought the bridge would finish off the local Gaelic culture.
Again Graeme Woolaston's judgment of the arts situation in Glasgow (and
Edinburgh) is misguided. Nothing would do Glasgow's arts infrastructure more
good than to be run by Scots. Metropolitan tastes and fashions ring false up
here.
At a conference in the Burrell I attended some time ago a great cultural
panjandrum up from Queen Anne Gate said this to an international audience:
``Glasgow has splendid museums and galleries because it has no history.'' The
Dutchman beside me was shocke
d.
At another international conference in Edinburgh run by the Scotch Whisky
Association no-one could have guessed from the British speakers that the
product was Scottish; they were all English.
Finally, at an important film conference in Ayrshire no-one would have known
that there were any film-makers in Scotland at all, though at the last Oscars
ceremony the only Oscar awarded to Britain was to a Tartan Short.
It is the same in most areas of Scottish life now, even in local government.
The majority of staff at our universities are English, though the system they
were educated in is quite different from ours, which they therefore cannot help
but distort.
When to all that is added the imposition of Westminster decisions by the
Scottish Office in defiance of Scottish opinion, I would have thought that
Graeme Woolaston would have had more understanding of Scottish resentment.
His condemnation of the TV programme, The Englishing of Scotland, shows that he
does not understand.
George Rosie is a highly regarded writer and playwright with a great respect
for the truth and empathy for the moods of the Scottish people.

THERE has been recent media coverage of Lord Baden Powell, the founder of the
Scouts, regarding his sexual tendencies.
Indeed, the mass media at large appear to highlight the aspects of voluntary
organisations which the public may at first find hard to swallow. Sir William
Alexander Smith founded the Boys' Brigade in Glasgow in 1883, and greatly
influenced Lord Baden Powe
ll.
These two organisations, run by unpaid volunteeers, have helped to enrich the
lives of boys in every thinkable aspect of life for more than a century. Why
are the positive points of the Scouts and Boys' Brigade not highlighted? Why is
their grave need for
helpers not publicised?

WEEKEND Extra made interesting reading as usual (December 23). However, I found
it sad that the Free Church member would not be celebrating Christmas.
Despite the fact that this time has become hijacked by commercialism, it can
still be used as a focal point for the Christian Church to remember the birth
of Jesus.
We focus on His death at communion (or mass). Of course we have no exact date
of birth. However, scholars do give a date of some time about winter 5/4.BC
from the Gospel chronologies.
If one wishes to use accuracy as a reason for the non-celebration of Christmas
then surely the principle should apply to all times in the church calendar.
However, living so explicitly creates problems.
For example, Sunday was not the date of the Sabbath. It was Saturday. Sunday
was used after Constantine's conversion in 325.AD. In fact all the names of the
days derive from the Roman calendar.
Furthermore, New Year's Day in a Scriptural context was based on the lunar
calendar. Therefore for the Bible writers it changed from year to year and
certainly did not correspond to our New Year's Day.
If one wishes to live only those things stated explicitly, then we would not,
for example, use toilets as they are not mentioned in the Bible.
This is one Evangelical Christian who enjoys Christmas.

THE review of David Donald's book, Lincoln, was immensely interesting.
In 1984 Gore Vidal's Lincoln, in which Donald assisted, caused a furore by
disclosing that the American President was in two minds whether to integrate
the coloureds into the many states or to colonise them.
That continent eventually decided on ``togetherness''. Similar dilemmas occur
100 years later in another continent, this time Europe. Integration of peoples
and their utterances, or robustly separate nations?
Plus ca change.

WHILE it may or may not be the case that Miller-DYWIDAG, the Skye Bridge
builders, may have a valid claim for compensation from the Scottish Office, the
public have also suffered financially and may also have a just claim to some
form of financial recompe
nse.
The return of monies spent by the Appellants in the Court of Session, Motion to
Suspend the Construction works in November 1992 would not have been necessary
if the construction had not started prematurely.
Following the local public inquiry in Kyle the Secretary of State considered
the evidence and published his decision letter on June 25, 1992.
The public then had a period of six weeks in which to appeal to the Court of
Session. On August 6, 1992, four members of the public appealed to the Court of
Session, but while the appeal was pending the construction works on the bridge
were proceeding.
The appellants were effectively forced to go to the Court of Session to request
a suspension of the construction works so that when the legal issues were
examined no irrevocable damage had been done. This Motion to Suspend was
refused on grounds of conven
ience; ie, because the construction work had already started it was deemed it
should continue.
The construction should not have started, at the earliest, before the statutory
public appeal period elapsed on August 7, 1992. Also since, in the event, four
appellants did appeal to the Court of Session, it is not unreasonable to expect
that bridge work
s would not start until after their lordships had had time to consider the
complex legal issues involving vulnerable species legislation.
This suspension request cost the appellants a great deal of money. Legal costs
wasted thousands of pounds in the Motion to Suspend basically because the
Secretary of State had allowed construction work to start before the public
appeal period had elapsed.
To add insult to injury, the appellants also had to pay for the Secretary of
State's legal costs. Two, Mr Peter Findlay and Dr Bruce Stevens, were both
personally liable and had to pay for Ian Lang's legal expenses of some #1365
for the hearing.
It seems that both Miller-DYWIDAG and the general public understood different
start-up dates from the information provided by the Scottish Office. How could
this ambiguity be possible?
One way this question can be resolved is for the Scottish Office to publish the
terms of the contract. If different dates were used for the public and for the
developer, no wonder confusion reigns.
The contract still remains secret under the cloak of commercial
confidentiality. However there can surely be no sensible reason, now that the
bridge is finished, to continue to keep this a secret. The public are
effectively a party to the contract, since
it was signed, on our behalf, by our own public officials. Those officials are
our public servants and are there first and foremost to safeguard our public
interest.

AS a first step in a strategy for tackling dental decay in children, parents
will have to be educated about dental care before the children get to school
age, eg, not to give a child juice in a bottle as the sugary substance sucked
in will damage the fron
t teeth.
Making a game of teeth-cleaning, especially at bedtime, is good practice.
Parents will have to be educated on diets not only for the sake of their
children's teeth but for overall wellbeing. This could mean reopening clinics
which have been closed down.
Another step towards helping children to better dental health would be to
repeal the decision not to supply milk to school children.
Another method would be to supply fruit and vegetable vouchers (along the same
lines as milk vouchers) so that families on benefits, especially those living
in outlying schemes where fresh fruit and veg are harder and dearer to come by,
are not disadvanta
ged even more.
Visits by school dentists should be made more frequently and take in all
children.

<TEXT>
HAVING worked closely with parents as a headteacher may I suggest that the
solution to problems such as have arisen in Stirling and London lies firmly in
the hands of parents?
A child's attitude toward school and teachers comes in the main from that
engendered by parents in the home. In particular instances where I have been in
conflict with parents I have noticed a negative response from the pupil in the
classroom.
Parents must back teachers even in difficult decisions where the child comes
off worse and loses face in front of his or her classmates.
Parental attitudes which encourage the cult of embryonic ego gratification and
self-obsession do no favour to the child who will be unable to achieve
unrealistic goals set in later life.
At this early stage of life, to behave as though one has all the answers
commands little respect and is an almost insurmountable obstacle in allowing
one to adopt the worthy and gratifying role of learner.
If teachers are to respect children then children must be brought to understand
that respect is a double-edged blade.
If parents want secure, meaningful education they must respect the teachers'
professional judgment and indeed hand their children over totally to the
teacher during the school day and let their children know that parent and
teacher are uniting for the chi
ld's benefit.
The standard of teaching has improved since we parents were at school. No
longer are there malicious, vindictive, arrogant sadists beating children for
poor conjugation. The great majority of teachers now are open, caring
professionals who need the backin
g of parents to give them and the children what they want.
The alternative is a fortress mentality where money allows the more privileged
to have their children educated by those who care and, for the rest, an
underfunded battlefield of decaying buildings and overcrowded classrooms.

Minimum wage
I HAVE difficulty in understanding how political organisations and trade unions
can continually advocate the introduction of a national minimum wage while
simply ignoring valid questions as to the impact of its introduction.
In the construction industry there is an ever-increasing drive away from
employing individuals (earning wages) towards the use of labour-only
sub-contractors (LOSCs) with the latter, as they act as sub-contractors, not
receiving wages and being required t
o tender for the work.
Such LOSCs, unless I stand to be corrected by those who advocate the
introduction of a national minimum wage, will fall outwith any such legislation
and therefore defeat its objective.
Worse still, all bona fide employers, while still being required to meet the
costs of holiday pay, sick pay, National Insurance, travel expenses, etc, will
be faced with the need to pay a national minimum wage and yet compete in the
market-place against o
ther companies which neither meet the employment costs nor pay a national
minimum wage.
In order to survive employers will have to change their working practices
resulting in more and more operatives becoming LOSCs so further destabilising
the employment patterns in this country.
How this can be perceived to be a benefit for anyone defies logic.

A TRADE-UNION leader was reported as being critical of the policy of Asda
Stores Ltd, in using members of uniformed youth organisations in their stores.
The basis of the criticism seems to be that young people are being used instead
of staff.
As a Scout Leader in the East End of Glasgow I would like to point out several
facts.
My troop, involving around 25 boys and girls, have assisted in the Asda store
in The Forge, Parkhead, for many years. Our main duty is bag packing and the
rewards are earned by the generosity of the customers.
A bucket is left beside every Scout in which the customers, if they wish, can
leave a donation.
From the money raised my troop have fulfilled the following: brought a Romanian
paediatrician and a civil engineer for a three-week study tour in Scotland
costing around #4000; sent one of our 16-year-old Scouts to the World Jamboree
in South Korea, enabl
ed the troop to camp in Switzerland and Denmark, and raised funds to supplement
the generous donations that Asda make to local charities.
As well as such specific benefits the money raised enables opportunities of
education for all the Scouts, and it is interesting that I have no smokers or
young people involved with drugs.

WHAT a difference a degree makes, especially if it's a degree of temperature.
This week, as my body temperature soared, the air temperature plummeted.
I could see great lumps of ice floating down the Clyde from my bedroom window,
while in my throat were lodged something which felt like broken glass. Hell is
not a bonfire - it takes only a temperature rise of a couple of degrees
Centigrade to create one
inside you.
I shall spare you the details. You have probably had the ubiquitous virus
yourself, and don't need to be reminded of days when you were one of the undead.
It takes something different to create the spectacular fall in air temperature
we have experienced this week but we sure have had it and it has triggered off
several side-effects. Even the trusty method of clearing roads by the
application of salt to redu
ce the melting point has not worked. (The salt and water mixture freezes at a
lower temperature than water alone, but this week it was so cold that salt and
water froze.)
There was something awesome about the big freeze. Rentaquote politicians
indulged in ritual denunciation of the Government and the public utilities, but
the enormity of the problem seemed to go beyond anything that could reasonably
be foreseen.
Of course it didn't stop some from trying. It seems to be a particularly
Scottish characteristic that we need someone to blame for our failures. Surely
no power or water supplier can foresee temperatures of minus 20C, but that
didn't stop some having a tr
y to blame it all on them.
The tragic loss of life in the Yorkshire pond, in which a little girl trying to
rescue a dog perished along with the two men who tried to save her, is as cruel
an event as one can think of.
But we would find it impossible to apportion blame. Unless we want the kind of
theology which traces every single event to God's purposes.
Some religious people who have strong faith are tempted to take this attitude,
but I believe it leads to a terrible view of God. I have always believed that
as long as there is water, ice, and the laws of gravity, there will be some who
drown, others who
slip and break a leg, and we should not try to explain such events as if they
were part of a celestial puppet show.
My fascination with temperature balance in our bodies and in nature has led me
to realise that it is a paradigm for our ecology. There is a very small band of
temperatures (inside and outside us) within which human life is possible.
Although there are som
e places, eg Siberia, in which there are wider poles, the mean is still within
narrow limits. Likewise there are deserts which were once within the mean (back
in the days of the Romans versus the Carthaginians in the Sahara). Only the
north and south pole
s seem to lie permanently outwith habitable terrain.
In other words we tread fairly narrow limits. That is one of the reasons which
sees to it that life prospers on the planet. But let us suppose for a moment
that the balance is disrupted, and mean temperature begins to rise or fall.
That is what happened d
uring Ice Age 20,000 years ago (a mere blink in geological time). The earth's
temperature was then 4C less than it is today. Not much, is it? I learned this
fact from volcano expert Dr James Jackson, who is giving the Christmas lectures
at the Royal Insti
tution in London.
He also threw in this other fact: that a volcano which exploded on an island in
the Philippines a few years ago caused an increase in the earth's temperature
of one half a degree Centigrade.
In addition to aerosols, car exhausts, acid rain, nature seems to be doing its
own little bit to make sure life is less secure.
Meanwhile a survey undertaken by Friends of the Earth and published yesterday
suggests that Scots will be horribly underwhelmed by this news. One in five
Scots are ``not even slightly concerned'' about the environment.
One exception was my aunt Louisa who died this year aged 96 and kept a library
of cuttings on threats to the environment. She was sure the next century will
see a huge ecological catastrophe with tidal waves caused by melted icebergs.
I tended to discount her pessimism - after all the scientists could not agree
among themselves but now I not so sure.
Life on earth is sustained by a system of checks and balances. Disturbing this
produces a chain reaction which even the smartest scientist cannot predict
accurately. We saw what Chernobyl did - what price a few wee volcanoes added to
the firework display?
So far we find it impossible to feed, clothe, keep healthy, and shelter those
who share the planet with us. How can we possibly get anywhere near this with
spiralling birth rates and gross over-population?
Whether you compare it to a snowstorm or a volcano, it still spells a midwinter
nightmare for those who will live in the next century.

Dropped
linesman
to take
action
LINESMAN George McGuire is taking legal advice after having been demoted by the
SFA following an October 21 incident at Ibrox involving Alan Lawrence, of
Hearts, and Rangers defender Craig Moore.
McGuire, of Bonnyrigg, and Aberdeen referee Mike Pocock missed an alleged elbow
incident by Lawrence, who later received a one-match, SFA suspension on the
strength of a referee supervisor's report.
Earlier this month, the 41-year-old civil servant was told he can now officiate
in amateur football only after 14 years as a referee in Scotland.
``I am taking legal advice on the matter,'' said McGuire, who claims he was
told there was no right of appeal against the decision.
It is believed McGuire is angry that his explanation that he did not see the
incident involving Lawrence and Moore was not accepted by SFA officials.
FIFA-listed referee John Rowbotham and Jim McCluskey also have been carpeted by
the SFA, but look to have escaped the severe action taken against McGuire.
George Cumming, the SFA's Referee and Development Director, would not say
whether or not McGuire's demotion was due to the Lawrence incident. However, he
confirmed that Rowbotham and McCluskey were pulled up by the Referee
Supervisors' Executive committee
``at the same time'' as McGuire, although he would not reveal whether they had
been punished.
q JIM Duffy last night said that it could be the summer before he knows if he
will be part of a management buy-out at Dundee.
Canadian chairman, Ron Dixon, revealed at the start of the month that he had
lined up a #3m deal that would hand control of the Dens Park outfit to Duffy
and vice-chairman Malcolm Reid.
Duffy said, hours before the club's agm last night: ``We would not just be
buying a football team if this deal goes through. The structure of the club is
involved. Hopefully, Dundee are going to return to the premier division and I
personally back the vie
w expressed by people in the game that clubs in the top division should be
required to meet certain criteria.
``That means we have to consider issues like undersoil heating and increased
facilities for supporters.''
``As far as I am concerned these discussions could take months, but we are
certainly not backing out of the plan. We are keeping in touch with the
chairman now that he is no longer in the country, and he is keeping in touch
with us.''

ON paper, five games in a row unbeaten by Dundee United, and only one loss in
five by Airdrie, would please most managers and football pundits, especially in
such a tight league as the first division.
Enter the three-points-for-a-win syndrome, and suddenly the icy blast comes
more from disgruntled coaches than the present spell of weather.
United have three draws in their run, with the loss of six points, while
Airdrie have dropped seven over the same hurdle.
Amazingly, as the two square up in the only surviving first-division fixture on
top of the Tannadice electric blanket today, Airdrie have played only twice
since drawing 1-1 with United at Broadwood on November 25.
Manager Billy Kirkwood's Christmas cheer was dented when the Taysiders could
not defeat bottom-club Dumbarton on Boxing Day.
And Scotland Under-21 winger Andy McLaren is left out of today's game as a
result as Kirkwood seeks the type of consistent performance that would take his
team back into the premier division.
``It is now time for players coming into the side to show the sort of form that
will mean them keeping their places,'' he said. ``Equally, anyone left out must
show they want to fight to get back in.''
Another Scotland Under-21 player, midfielder David Hannah, could make his first
start since the opening day of the season, after having been out with a groin
injury.
Airdrie, meanwhile, have defender Sean Sweeney and striker Steve Cooper
grinding through their long-term suspensions - Sweeney is out for six games,
and Cooper for five - and they should have had Paul Jack back, but a recurrence
of the injury that has kep
t him out for many weeks means he again will be sitting this one out.
Kirkwood, desperate for a victory that would take his side to the top of the
league, added: ``We shouldn't need any warnings at this stage of the season,
but they are certainly there if we want to look for them. This is a big game
for us.''
Meanwhile, Kirkwood released David Craig, the former Partick Thistle
midfielder, who was immediately signed by Hamilton Accies.

THE English Football League have survived the latest threat to its future, when
the 24 first division clubs backed away from mass resignation.
Norwich, Crystal Palace, and Oldham had led the protests, after the League's
extraordinary general meeting in London had thrown out a proposal which would
have given the top-flight clubs a greater say in the running of League affairs.
All but three of the first division clubs had earlier abstained when chairmen
voted through cash split proposals relating to the new, five-year, #125m deal
with Sky TV.
That contract would have been worthless had Palace chairman Ron Noades and his
fellow hardliners persuaded the clubs to hand in their notice to quit the
League before tomorrow's deadline.
The first division clubs had gone into emergency session immediately after the
EGM, but after three hours, League president Gordon McKeag was summoned to be
told that the resignation threat had been removed.

<HEADLINE>Striker's short stay at Ibrox could end soon Majorca are set to move for Salenko</HEADLINE>

A SPANISH second-division side is considering an audacious move to sign Oleg
Salenko, who is ready to make his first-team return in Rangers'
premier-division match against Hibernian this afternoon, in an attempt to
strengthen their hopes of promotion to t
he first division.
Real Majorca say that after having been approached by an agent asking them if
they would be interested in either of two players, one of them Salenko, they
are trying to put together a deal which would persuade Rangers to part with the
player they signed f
rom Valencia.
The Ibrox club paid around #2.5m for Salenko, but he has never looked at ease
in Scottish football. Indeed, it would not be a surprise if he had a notion to
return to Spanish football, where he has tended to start well with clubs and
then shade.
The player might say the coaches have never done him any favours, but in his
time with Rangers he has not appeared like the type willing to match the
determination and commitment of others around him.
In a Spanish radio interview yesterday, Dr Beltran, president of Majorca, who
were one of the favourites for promotion before the season started but who have
dropped to thirteenth place, suggested that Salenko and Rangers might be
interested in doing busi
ness.
He also said that if the deal went through it would be his club's biggest
signing. The Spanish transfer deadline runs out on January 15, and with it
could go Majorca's chance of winning a place among the country's elite.
Rangers would expect to get their money back for Salenko, and Dr Beltran said
it might be possible for his club to find the cash from various sources to
finance a deal. In particular, the television station, Antena Tres, with whom
the club president is sa
id to have connections, might be willing to assist financially.
Although in the wrong half of the table after 17 matches, Majorca are only
seven points away from a promotion place - two clubs are promoted automatically
- and with 21 games remaining, Beltran believes ground can be made up if the
team had a forward like
Salenko.
Another of Rangers' strikers Gordon Durie, who has struck a rich vein of
scoring form at the time when Rangers need him, is not certain to play against
Hibernian this afternoon, when the Ibrox side hope to widen the gap between
themselves and Celtic at th
e top of the premier division.
The striker is nursing a thigh injury and will report early this morning to
undergo a fitness check. Naturally, with Ally McCoist still injured, although
he might be available for the Old Firm game at Celtic Park on January 3, Walter
Smith, the Rangers ma
nager, is hoping Durie recovers and is able to play a part in the attempt to
exact revenge on Hibs.
The Edinburgh club are the only team to have beaten Rangers in the league this
season - Darren Jackson's penalty was enough to give Hibs all three points when
they last played at Ibrox in September - and although the defending champions
won 4-1 at Easter
Road last month, they want to erase the memory of the home defeat. Durie's
scoring form could help them achieve that small, but no less important,
ambition.
``I'm hoping he'll make it, yes, because he has been enjoying what is probably
his best spell since coming to Ibrox, although he did start his career here
pretty well,'' said Smith. ``It has been difficult for him over the period,
because I have used him
in various positions, but up front is where he is at his best.''
Alex Cleland is available again and likely to start the game, one of only three
matches which survived the sub-zero temperatures - the two others are the
contests between Dundee United and Airdrie, in the first division, and Queen's
Park and Ross County,
in Division 3 - and Oleg Salenko also is fit and ready to begin a two-game
period which could have a significant bearing on the championship pursuit.
Celtic's match against Hearts at Tynecastle was postponed, which means they
will have been inactive since
their game against Falkirk two weeks ago.
Then they were only two points behind Rangers, but they could go into the Old
Firm game on Wednesday eight points behind if Smith's players beat Hibs. Celtic
would be faced with the prospect of playing for the first time in
two-and-a-half weeks, and witho
ut the suspended Peter Grant and John Hughes while trying to prevent Rangers
from moving even further ahead.
However, Simon Donnelly believes that Celtic's enforced idleness will not
affect them in mid-week. ``Everyone at the club is looking forward to the
game,'' said Donnelly. ``We have been training hard, with a lot of us staying
back for extra sessions, so o
ur fitness level is good.''
If by the time the lights are doused on Wednesday night, Celtic are 11 points
behind, pressure would mount on them, but that is not to say Rangers are
without concern. ``It's being said that pressure is being placed on those teams
who are not getting game
s, but there is a pressure to win on those who are playing,'' said Smith.
``There is no point in having these games if you are going to lose them, just
as there would be little good in losing to Hibs but beating Celtic.''
In the past, while they were compiling their run of seven titles in a row,
Rangers usually set off on a run around this point, but this time it will be
extremely difficult for them to better their first half of this season. To do
so they would have to go
through the second half of the programme undefeated.
Hibs, whose recent form has been dreadful, were hoping to have Michael O'Neill
available again after suspension, but he must complete his ban this afternoon,
because the Boxing Day game against Partick Thistle was postponed. Manager Alex
Miller is also un
able to call on Willie Miller, Gareth Evans, Graeme Mitchell, and Darren Dods.
Concerned about the effects the weather is likely to have on the New Year's Day
schedule, the Scottish League intend checking on pitches this afternoon and
again there are likely to be early postponements. Indeed, the game between
Aberdeen and Raith Rover
s on Tuesday is already in serious doubt because of fears about the safety of
the supporters.
Pittodrie has undersoil heating, but Aberdeen's manager, Roy Aitken, explained:
``The police advise that they would not recommend the game goes on unless the
weather improves. We are experiencing freak conditions in the North East and
the roads are a prob
lem.

FIFE Flyers could climb to their highest premier division place so far this
season with victory over Humberside Hawks tonight.
A win treble has lifted the Kirkcaldy club into seventh spot, and a point
behind former league pace-setters Basingstoke Bison. Player-coach Mark
Morrison, just back in Scotland after a whirlwind holiday trip with his family
to Canada, said: ``I set the bo
ys a target of six points from the four games around Christmas and new year.
``They've done brilliantly to beat Slough Jets and Milton Keynes Kings on the
road and see off Newcastle Warriors at Kirkcaldy. It really would be the icing
on the cake if we could finish off with a win over Humberside in front of our
own fans.''
Flyers will be at full strength for the match.

<HEADLINE>Forsyth drugs message Churchillian appeal over the top</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>12</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974635206</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER else he has achieved since he returned to Scotland, and there have
been major achievements deserving of praise, Michael Forsyth has been
singularly misguided in that part of his new year message which dealt with his
``major new national initiativ
e against drugs''. Neither the substance nor the tone did the Scottish
Secretary any credit. The misuse of drugs is a serious problem, but to the
extent that: ``The drugs epidemic is a scourge as terrible as any medieval
plague. This country strove in uni
ty, as one nation, during the Second World War to defeat tyranny. We must find
that unity again to crush the drugs menace.'' The plague analogy is a gross
exaggeration and the Churchillian appeal to wartime unity is over the top.
When Mr Forsyth then talks of ``winning back Scotland from the drugs culture''
and ``liberating a generation'' he is quarrying the rich seam of drugs-war
rhetoric which swept America 10 years ago but which has been discredited there
as pandering to the fe
ars and prejudices of the right. He would have been better served had someone
told him that this has also been discredited here. It is the kind of talk
deliberately calculated to play on the fear of the rise of an underclass; a
seething mass of uneducated
, inadequate, housing-scheme dwellers - disenfranchised by self-imposed
unemployment - unwilling to break out of their poverty trap and rampant with
hatred and jealousy of the better-placed middle classes. It is the same kind of
talk which is used to marg
inalise single parents or to justify cuts in benefit to young people as if they
themselves were entirely to blame for being jobless, while the reality is
continuing large-scale unemployment. The Scottish Secretary was on safe ground
when he said he had en
listed the leaders of the other major parties to line up behind Scotland
Against Drugs because no party leader in his right mind could do other. There
is some evidence that the other parties were expecting a joint announcement but
instead the idea has bee
n turned into another soundbite for Mr Forsyth. There already exists a vast
literature on every aspect of drugs abuse, every parent in the country has been
exposed relentlessly to it in the past five years and we have had an endless
round in Scotland of s
eminars, conferences, and police initiatives discussing what should be done. A
very considerable industry, involving thousands of people in the social
services, has grown up around the apparent need to treat drug users as if they
were suffering from some
kind of pernicious illness which was not their fault. Brutal reality is
different, of course, and much more prosaic. The major drug of abuse in
Strathclyde, in Scotland, and in a growing area of England is a sleeping pill
called Temazepam, stronger contro
ls of which have met with bitter resistance from the pharmaceutical industry,
which enjoys most-favoured status along with the booze and tobacco industries
in the eyes of the Government. It remains unfashionable to point out that the
social damage done by
cigarettes, alcohol, and prescription drugs is far more pernicious and has
gone on for far longer than the present drugs scare.
The Government's own task force, an all-party body, has barely had time to sit
down in the wake of its exhaustive examination of drugs problems in Scotland,
an inquiry which focused thinking on multi-agency approaches and which led to
the creation of the
area drug task forces based on the health boards. These have just been set up
and are getting their act together, begging the question of just how much more
talking Mr Forsyth wants. His big idea of partnership to beat the dealers is
therefore only an exi
sting objective dressed up and recycled. The pragmatic approach of Strathclyde
Police - educating and informing, offering diversion for youngsters and then
actually driving at the users, and through them the dealers, with single-minded
purpose is the exam
ple the rest of Scotland should look to.

<HEADLINE>A toast to Burns No slow build-up to celebrations</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>12</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974635207</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AFTER an embarrassing bout of hiccups, the great Burns festivities are about to
begin. So let's raise a glass (or two) to the national bard. The kind of
publicity gained by the organisation set up to run the official Burns
bicentenary festival may not hav
e been quite what it wanted, but it has achieved something after all. If you
didn't know it before, you know it now - 1996 marks the 200th anniversary of
the death of Robert Burns. And celebrations will start with a bang - there will
be no slow build-up t
o the climax. It was ``a blast o Janwar win'' that hanselled the infant Burns
on his entry into the world, and January has always been the big month in the
Burns calendar. This year there will be an extra dash of spice in the haggis
and champit tatties at
a multitude of Burns' suppers. True, these bizarre occasions usually celebrate
the poet's supposed excesses in the way of boozing and womanising rather than
his literary achievement, but at least they show he is not forgotten. The
memory is immortal, eve
n if many of us at table are a little hazy about just what it is we are
remembering. But Burns suppers are only the start. There will be a fireworks
show at Alloway where he was born, and a procession in Dumfries where he died.
Massed choirs, country danc
ers, fiddle bands, and television stars - ``a cast of over 600'', in the words
of the programme - will provide a spectacular in Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
And there is more serious fare. Students of the man and his works will gather
for a three-day inter
national conference at Strathclyde University, and a major exhibition will open
this summer at the National Museum of Scotland. All that seems to be missing is
the film epic. After Rob Roy and Braveheart, the biopic Rabbie would have
rounded off the tarta
n trilogy nicely.
So the year will provide plenty of spectacle and entertainment. It will be fun,
and doubtless it will do wonders for tourism. Dare we hope that it may even
help to create a new readership for the poet, who after all lives best in his
works. Though Burns i
s a national icon, it's doubtful if many Scots today know the poems at all
well. It used to be said that even the humblest family could boast two books
its possession, one being the Bible and the other a copy of the poems and songs
of Robert Burns. Those
days are gone. Burns's gift was to speak directly to the heart, and it is this
which won him his unique place in the popular mind. Whether he is Scotland's
greatest literary figure is a matter of debate. Walter Scott long ago laid a
fair claim to that tit
le. Scotland has produced other writers of genius, both before and after Burns.
Robert Burns stands not alone, but as a leading figure among a host of bright
talents. Perhaps they merit at least a few grace notes in the fanfare.

Lesley Duncan tunes in to a Merry Widow and a
fiddler on the airwaves
ESCAPE to Vienna this Hogmanay weekend. Michael Bevis says Happy Birthday
Hanna! on Radio 2 at 5.03pm today as he traces the history of Franz Lehar's The
Merry Widow, first performed in the Austrian capital exactly 90 years ago. ``I
want to write music fo
r and around human beings, their hearts, their souls, their emotions and
passions, their joy and sadness,'' wrote Lehar. The unabated popularity of his
operetta suggests that he succeeded.
Darker operatic fare is offered by Radio 3 (6.30-10.25pm) when Tchaikovsky's
The Queen of Spades is broadcast Live from the Met. Still more music from
Lesley Garrett and Friends at 7.33pm on Radio 2 in a gala concert from the
Barbican, London.
Meanwhile Radio 4 listeners with a taste for ``the terrible and menacing, like
an unopened door in a bad dream'' may have shivered away the afternoon with the
Playhouse adaptation of Walter de la Mare's short story Seaton's Aunt
(2.30-4pm).
The play's the thing tomorrow, too. Radio 4 continues its Trollope
dramatisations with the start of Barchester Towers. The plot takes up the story
of the Harding family, first met in The Warden, broadcast in November. Alec
MacCowen and Juliet Aubrey resum
e their roles as Septimus and and his widowed daughter Eleanor while Simon
Russell Beale impersonates the odious curate Slope. Will he get his
comeuppance? The plot unfolds in three episodes. (2.30-3.30pm).
This being the time of year for reflection and retrospection, Radio 3 is
appropriately hosting a Memory Night: subtitled Remembering and Forgetting. The
evening opens with a collage of music, poems, and readings from the
photographic memory of childhood.
But as the theme is pursued, darker issues are confronted, including - by the
end of the evening (and year) - the nature of false memory with its
implications for child abuse and claims of abduction by aliens. In the course
of the evening, playwright and
actor Harold Pinter himself stars in the first production of The Proust
Screenplay, his film script for an unmade version of A la Recherche du Temps
Perdu (8.20-10.20pm).
Radio Scotland listeners will have a less taxing time with Cape Breton Island
Revisited (8pm), in which master fiddler Aly Bain traces the footsteps of the
early Scottish settlers of the Canadian island and swaps chat and tunes with
friends old and new.
Radio Scotland Be-Bops to Hip-Hops its way into the New Year with David Sillars
as host of a Hogmanay Special jazz party. Then, from 12.30am, the command is to
Party On! with John Cavanagh and Mark Percival.
Monday morning sees Radio 3 make its customary relay from The New Year's Day
Concert in Vienna (10.15am-12.30pm). Alternatively, at 10.15 on Radio 4, Long
Wave, youngsters may hear the first of five winning stories for children to
emerge from a recent Rad
io 4/Good Housekeeping Magazine competition. Joanna Lumley offers her choice of
music (Glenn Miller to Elton John) in a New Year's Day special (Radio 2,
10.03am-1pm).
Robert Burns, Hugh MacDiarmid, and Stuart Conn - as you've probably never heard
them before - feature in Cover Stories: Scots to Esperanto on Radio Scotland at
12.05pm. But can the true meaning and idiom of poetry really be translated? A
fascinating quest
ion for presenter David Stenhouse.
If you're an Archers fan rather than the kind of person (me) who feels queasy
at the first note of the signature tune, you'll not miss Monday's visit to
Ambridge at 7.05pm on Radio 4. It's 45 years to the day (gosh) since the
country saga was first broadc
ast. In episode 11,721, Ambridge folk look forward to another year. Will Shula

RATHER good timing of Radio 2 to broadcast its celebration of Ginger Rogers on
Boxing Day with her sung encouragement that we should dust ourselves down, pick
ourselves up, and start all over again. Though Katharine Hepburn defined the
famous dancing team
thus - ``He gave her class, and she gave him sex'' - the bitchiness nearly
lost beneath presenter Wayne Sleep's appalling mimicry - the relationship of
the mythical partnership was neither the illicit affair of popular fantasy nor
the passionate feud con
cocted by the studio's publicity machine.
They were both obviously bound by their shared obsessive perfectionism.
Rogers's cream-coloured shoes darkened after one gruelling take, and the fact
she was being filmed in black and white meant the blood did not read as blood.
In Top Hat, Rogers remembe
red Astaire's annoyance that her unforgettable feathered dress left
unforgivable fluff all over his perfect tuxedo. Though she said it didn't. A
minor tiff between major hoofers.
Ginger, seemingly, was fond of quoting a sassier description than Hepburn's
about themselves: ``Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred did, only she did it
backwards and in high heels.'' Even Sleep's pretty banal commentary did not
trip up the programme t
oo much, but did he have to say - after mentioning The Gay Divorcee - ``that
title would have to go today''? Was that his idea of something modern-sounding?
During the filming of Follow the Fleet Astaire was walking down the street when
he heard the sound of a cement mixer and proceeded to improvise a dance to its
rhythm. The noise became part of Irving Berlin's score and was incorporated
into a scene in the
machine room of the boat. This anecdote would have delighted the brilliant
composer, Simon Jeffes, whose Penguin Cafe Orchestra (R3) similarly marries the
arbitrary with rigorous musicality.
Like Rogers and Astaire, Jeffes's work dissolves hierarchical snobberies. They
include ukuleles, jukeboxes, dripping taps, and penny whistles as well as
classic chamber orchestra instruments, and the results are gloriously tuneful,
moving, and original.
Like the serendipity of Astaire's cement-mixer sound, Jeffes once made a phone
call and heard the simultaneous sound of ringing and engaged tones.
He accompanied the rhythm with an elastic band, which he twanged with a handy
screwdriver, and from this grew an extraordinarily beautiful piece.
Accessible and melodious, Telephone and Rubber Band had my seven-year-old
daughter dancing around the room and she laughed when I told her the story.
Whereas The Laughing Policeman song, before it was binned, had her running and
screaming out the door.
Maybe I should tell Roy Hudd about this. He implied in Roy Hudd's Extremely
Amusing History of the Comic Song (R2) that this number could make anyone
smile. I think it's best suited to a English murder movie, all end-of-the-pier
creepiness, with gruesome
landladies and nightmarish ventriloquists' dummies.
And while I would love to have seen Vesta Tilley and Marie Lloyd strut their
stuff, this really should have included the word English in the title.
Jake Thackeray got a mention and Victoria Wood got an accolade.
Her song was a trifle hypocritical, I thought, being about a performer urged by
a cynical agent to push the Northern England ticket.
Mention of Billy Dainty but none of Billy Connolly - Victor and Barry would
have choked on their Kelvinside quiche.
I don't know who decided to call Radio Scotland's Chomsky interview Noam's Ark
but I wish they hadn't. Still, it could have been worse. Could have been Eighth
Choice Chomsky, for according to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index the
American linguist an
d radical is number eight in the top 10 of the world's most-quoted writer, the
only one still living - and talking excellent sense.
His belief that rule of law is used when applied to the less powerful states
and the rule of force comes into play when the superpower is threatened was
given ample detailed examples. Reagan, Thatcher, and now Newt Gingrich fighting
their war against the
welfare of family and children while preaching homey values, show us how
carefully we must protect the true language of democracy against its distorters.

AUSTRALIA gradually wore down Sri Lanka's spirited resistance yesterday to move
within sight of victory in the second Test in Melbourne, despite a tenacious
century by Asanka Gurusinha.
The left-hander frustrated Australia for seven minutes short of six hours in
compiling his highest Test score of 143 to save Sri Lanka from the humiliation
of a second successive innings defeat against the Aussies.
But with only four wickets in hand and a lead of just 17, the tourists' fate
appears certain.
At the close, Sri Lanka were 284 for six from 103 overs, with captain Arjuna
Ranatunga, their last recognised batsman, on six alongside pace bowler Chaminda
Vaas on five.
Resuming on 33 for one, Sri Lanka batted with determination to ensure Australia
must at least bat again to take a winning 2-0 lead in the three-Test series.
Gurusinha, who began the day on eight, hammered one six and 15 fours during an
innings lasting 274 balls, eclipsing his 137 against the same opponents in
Colombo in 1992-93.
He eventually lost his wicket after tea when he was trapped leg before wicket
by pace bowler Paul Reiffel.
Gurusinha said he was delighted with his century given the circumstances,
adding: ``That was the best of my seven hundreds in Test cricket.'' Scores:
Australia - 500 for six (Steve Waugh 131 not out, David Boon 110). Sri Lanka -
233 (Arjuna Ranatunga 51, Glenn McGrath five for 40) and 284 for six (Asanka
Gurusinha 143).
q WEST Indies captain Richie Richardson steered his side to the first win of
their Australian tour with a seven-wicket defeat of a Queensland XI yesterday
in a one-day match in Toowoomba, 100km west of Brisbane. Richardson scored 75
not out from 84 delive
ries as the West Indies chased, and passed, the young Queenslanders' total of
237 for eight from 50 overs.
The West Indians reached 241 for the loss of three wickets when Richardson
stroked the winning runs from the first ball of the forty-ninth over.

AS THEY awoke on Christmas morning to the news that Scotland had been swept by
snowstorms the men who maintain the power lines which light up one-quarter of
the UK knew that their turkey and plum pudding would have to wait.
Some of the linesmen who work for Hydro-Electric have yet to enjoy their
Christmas lunch. In the most remote and hostile corners of Scotland they have
been working in appalling conditions to try to ensure that their 600,000
customers enjoy the power which
they take for granted at the flick of a switch.
When the television goes off and the lights go out it will mean a relatively
short spell of inconvenience for the majority of the population but for the
linesmen it may mean several days of working in conditions which most would
find difficult to tolerate
for even hours.
They cope with biting winds, driving snow and rain, and often the hardest task
is reaching the area where the fault has occurred.
In the summer, as they walk the countryside checking the power lines amid
picture postcard terrain, they are the envy of those kept indoors by work. In
the past week that same countryside has taken on a Christmas-card appearance -
but the workers are the
envy of few.
Typical of the 500 linesmen and the 300 fitters, labourers, and drivers who
support them in Hydro-Electric's area are Gordon Leslie and Ronnie Milne who
were looking forward to Christmas Day with their families.
The excitement of Santa's visit for Gordon's four young children had the family
up just after 6am, but even as he had gone to bed on Christmas Eve, having
heard late news reports of the weather, he suspected it would be his workmates
rather than his wife
and children with whom he would spend the following day.
The presents were opened and the first call was from his mother-in-law, the
second from Hydro-Electric and he was off, as was Ronnie who was also looking
forward to a day with the family.
It was disappointing to have to leave the festive celebrations almost before
they had begun and Gordon had to miss the excitement experienced by
14-month-old Hayley enjoying her first meaningful Christmas, but neither
hesitated.
``We would not have liked to be without power on Christmas Day, unable to get
dinner, so it was easy to imagine how those affected must have felt,'' they
said.
``If there is a big fault you just have to go for it! There isn't really any
choice.''
As they moved all over North-east Scotland locating and repairing faults,
similar teams were attempting the same all over Hydro-Electric's territory
which includes everything north of a line roughly from Dunoon to Dundee and
covers 25% of the land mass of
the UK but is occupied by only 2% of its population.
Some from Aberdeen boarded the boat to Shetland to lend support to their
colleagues on the Islands who were facing unprecedented conditions. However,
Hydro-Electric had to be careful not to send too many out of the area in case
the already bad weather aro
und Aberdeen deteriorated, causing further problems.
There are a variety of problems which the linesmen face, from blown fuses,
caused when the conductor cables clash because they sag under the weight of ice
and sway with the wind, to poles snapping or burning down.
If whole communities are blacked out the linesmen head first for the
high-voltage cables and divide them into sections for checking. In situations
like that they send as many crews as possible to the fault to reduce the burden
on individual linesmen and s
peed up the restoration of supplies.
Once the large-scale problems have been repaired they think about individual
consumers, some of whom, it appears, are less well equipped to cope than they
once were.
``It can take as long to restore the supply to one consumer as it can to repair
a fault which has blacked out hundreds of consumers so obviously we do the
high-voltage lines which run from village to village first.
``Then we prioritise, deciding where to go next, either at the Aberdeen office
or out in the country using our local knowledge.''
There was a time when rural dwellers were born and brought up in the country,
knew how to look after themselves, and were prepared for the times when the
power went down.
Now many of those who live in isolated dwellings or communities are
``incomers'' who are less well versed in country matters and do not expect to
have to do anything other than flick a switch to keep warm.
The linesmen are, on the whole, welcomed. They have, however, detected a change
in atmosphere since privatisation. An intolerance has crept in which was seldom
around in the nationalised days.
``It used to be a case of `the Hydro Board will be here as soon as they can',
but since privatisation they expect us to arrive almost immediately,'' said
one. ``No matter how quickly we are there some people seem to expect us to have
arrived earlier. Some
seem to think it is their duty to hurry us up.''
Even when the fault is identified it does not necessarily mean an instant
repair. Because of the equipment they require they have to get fairly close to
the location and, as happened over Christmas at numerous sites, local
contractors had to be called out
to clear a path through the snow for the familiar blue and white Land Rovers
which are ``home'' for the linesmen when they are working. The heaters provide
some comfort for the linesman as they travel from job to job and prepare
themselves to hike throug
h the snow.
Normally in winter they try to find somewhere for a hot lunch to help them cope
with the conditions but for many on Christmas Day that proved impossible and it
was evening before they could eat.
Out in the wilds one day this week Gordon was looking forward to making a cup
of soup to heat his bones on the small stove he carries in his vehicle - but
his water had turned to ice in its plastic container and he had to do without
until he returned to h
is Aberdeen home at night.
In bygone days they would have tried to work through the night, and although
there are some occasions when they still do, the linesmen normally stop
mid-evening to allow them a good night's sleep, a hot meal, and a chance to get
warm dry clothing on for a
n early morning start.
Keeping warm is a challenge for the linesmen in conditions like the past week
and Hydro-Electric is constantly re-assessing their requirements to try to find
the best possible balance between being warm and having the manoeuvrability to
carry out their wo
rk while perched 20ft off the ground held only by a strap and two spikes in the
insteps of their boots.
Special kit includes woollen gloves with grips which allow them to cling to the
ice which inevitably forms on the windward side of the poles.
They are in no doubt about the job they hate most, replacing broken poles. The
poles often snap when the icy ground prevents them from swaying in the wind.
Some of the poles are more than 30 years old but most in vulnerable areas have
been replaced as part of a multi-million refurbishment by Hydro-Electric.
The linesmen, who have been responsible for replacing hundreds of miles of
cable and scores of poles during spells of less inclement weather, believe that
had the storm struck a few years ago the scale of the problem would have been
considerably greater.
When the fir poles do break the linesmen have to summon an excavator to the
location to dig out the old pole.
Poles apart, the challenge of restoring brightness to hundreds of homes is
rewarding for the linesmen.
``I quite like working on faults,'' said Ronnie. ``Sometimes trying to find the
fault can be a challenge and you learn a lot about the system, switching
sections on and off. Trying to solve why someone is receiving strange voltage
can be interesting.''
However, most of the linesmen have been challenged enough over Christmas and
are hoping that the bad weather holds off so they can enjoy New Year with their
families in the warmth of their own homes.

Following a vain five-hour bid by doctors to save three lives, Kirsty Scott
asks if resuscitation really can work
TO UNTRAINED eyes it seemed like a futile task. As the limp, waterlogged bodies
of three people were pulled from a frozen lake in Yorkshire on Thursday there
appeared to be no hope of saving any of them.
Yet rescuers and a team of doctors worked relentlessly for more than five hours
to try to resuscitate them, because there is often a small, slim chance that
victims of such accidents can literally be brought back to life.
``Basically, the cold affects the body by slowing down the system,'' says David
Campbell, a survival expert with the Survival Centre at Robert Gordon
University in Aberdeen. ``It shuts down parts of the body which are not
required to sustain life - the sk
in, the legs, the arms. What you have then is blood going into the core of the
body to maintain the vital organs.
``The body's way of reacting is to slow everything down. The heart can slow
down to somewhere in the region of six beats per minute or even slower.
Sometimes you also have a gagging reflex which closes off the airways and the
water doesn't get into the lu
ngs.''
Much of the original data on the effect on the human body of extreme cold comes
from Nazi experimentation, but there are more recent well-documented cases of
people being successfully resuscitated after long periods in icy water or
outdoor conditions. Mos
t recently, a man was brought round at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after falling
through ice as he tried to rescue his dog.
In Aberdeen several years ago, a girl who had decided to commit suicide went
into a churchyard, took pills and alcohol and lay down on a bench. She suffered
extreme hypothermia and her body core temperature fell to 18C, the same as the
people in Yorkshir
e, yet she was successfully rewarmed and revived. The normal body temperature
is 36C.
And in one of the most astonishing cases, a two-year-old Canadian girl who was
stuck outdoors for six hours in temperatures of -22 was later revived. The
child's heart had stopped and her body temperature had dropped to 14C, but
doctors hooked her up to
a heart bypass machine and spent five hours slowly bringing her body
temperature up.
Mr David Steedman, a consultant in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary's Accident and
Emergency Department, says it should never be assumed that people who have been
immersed in the cold for long periods have no chance of survival.
``I think in a scenario where major hypothermia is involved you should never,
unless the elements are so dangerous, declare death at the scene. Someone can
look as though they are dead but can be revived successfully.''
Steedman says the longest period someone's heart had stopped and been
successfully revived was three hours and 40 minutes.
Heart bypass, like that used on the young Canadian girl, is the method often
chosen in tandem with gentle warming techniques.
``It is not an infrequent occurrence in Canada and a lot of their resuscitation
units are set up to put these patients on to cardiac bypass,'' says Steedman.
``That's what we did for a patient we had in recently. We managed to transfer
him immediately fro
m Accident and Emergency to a unit which routinely carries out cardiac bypass.''
Steedman says it had originally been thought that children survived cold water
immersion better than adults because they experienced a reflex reaction when
cold water hit their faces, which slowed their heart.
``More recently, people believe that young children have cardiac arrest at a
very much lower temperature than adults. Their hearts keep pumping to a much
lower level, maybe 22 to 23. In an adult, cardicac arrest may be precipitated
at 27 to 28. We now
believe that's the reason why children may survive neurologically intact. In
Canada, young children have survived from extremely low temperatures, even
below 20.
Campbell says the rescuers in Yorkshire would not have attempted resuscitation
on the three victims unless it was possible there was still some life there. He
says there are many factors which affect a person's chances of survival and
some cases which def
y all logic.
``For example, there was an Icelandic trawler which got into difficulties and
the three crewmen went overboard, swam to shore then walked a few miles for
help and they survived. They shouldn't have.''

With regulators paid big sums to make companies the centre of their attention,
Christopher Sims turns the spotlight on the new breed of industry watchdog
PETER Davis, the National Lottery regulator in trouble for accepting free
flights from a major shareholder in Camelot, the company running the Lottery,
is not the first industry regulator to be accused of being nave.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, who oversees the electricity industry, caused an
enormous rumpus in March when he announced a new review of power prices just
after investors had bought a further tranche of electricity shares from the
Government.
The shares immediately fell in value, leaving buyers complaining bitterly that
they had paid too much and that they had been sold them under false pretences.
Labour accused the Government of ``conning'' people into buying the shares.
Professor Littlechild was accused of being nave in not appreciating the impact
his pronouncement would have on share prices. There were mutterings to the
effect that, as he came from an academic background with no experience of
business, he would not app
reciate how the stock market would react to a simple statement that he was
reconsidering the electricity price cap.
The regulators must have a thick skin because by their very nature they are
bound to offend almost everyone. Indeed they are not doing their job well if
all is sweetness and light with those they police.
Their brief is not really to be the consumers' champion, rather they are there
to hold the ring between the consumer and the supplier. So consumers always
think that they are being too soft on the companies and the companies feel they
are not allowing the
m to make a large enough return on their capital.
However, it is clear that companies have been much more profitable than
necessary so shareholders have been massively rewarded. The downward move of
the electricity shares in March was only a temporary blip in an onward march.
Regulators are essential when there are monopoly providers of services,
otherwise consumers would have little protection. But as Don Cruickshank, the
Scot who runs the telephone watchdog Oftel, believes, regulators should be
aiming to make themselves redu
ndant by promoting competition. Once consumers have a genuine choice,
competition will do a better job than a regulator.
But he is finding British Telecom's grip on the domestic market hard to loosen
and the small companies which try to get past the BT colossus would no doubt
accuse him of being nave in his hopes of cracking BT without drastic action.
Cruickshank certainly has experience of the private sector - for several years
he worked for Richard Branson's Virgin Group - but most regulators don't.
However, there is no doubting their intellectual ability, despite their
relatively low pay.
Peter Davis will lose #64,000 a year if he is sacked. Cruickshank is the
highest paid regulator at #124,000 which may seem a lot, but pales beside the
#530,000 plus share options earned by his chief protagonist Sir Iain Vallance,
chairman of BT. Yet he ha
s a job every bit as difficult and responsible. Sir Iain is batting just for
BT, Cruickshank is laying the ground rules for a whole industry.
On the other hand, Clare Spottiswoode appears to have a relatively simple task
as director general of Ofgas, regulating a single straightforward business,
British Gas. At least it seemed so when she took the job in 1993. Since then
the Government has deci
ded to bring forward the date when householders can choose their gas supply
company - now the regulator and British Gas have a more complicated task as a
result.
This was the reason why Michael Heseltine, then Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry, increased her salary by 22% to #90,000 earlier this year. In
contrast, Cedric Brown, the head of British Gas, received a 75% increase to
#475,000 - though he did re
fuse the latest company share options which could have netted him #2.4m. All
the regulators are paid much less than the heads of the companies they oversee.
Professor Littlechild's #102,000 a year compares unfavourably with the #148,000
earned by Murray S
tuart, non-executive chairman of ScottishPower, for example.
Spottiswoode was the successor to Sir James McKinnon, the Scot who was one of
the first of the regulators, and who established a reputation for abrasiveness.
She pursued a gentler path, though she too had to show a thick skin when
denying unfounded rumour
s she had had an affair with the civil servant who recommended her for the job.
Davis is a classic case of the regulator getting too close to the regulated,
something which watchdogs always need to guard against. The regulator and his
staff may have dealings with the same people over several years and it would be
no surprise if a cer
tain camaraderie develops.
It no doubt seemed perfectly reasonable for Davis at the time to accept
``lifts'' from GTECH, he may even have thought he was saving the taxpayer the
cost of several fares. But the warning bells should have rung as soon as the
invitation was made.
The relationship between the regulated and regulator should surely be such that
the former would not dream of offering hospitality to the person who indirectly
controls his profits and thereby the value of the directors' share options.

DURHAM CROSS-COUNTRY
OUT of Africa there is always something new to confound prospects of a British
cross-country revival. For years it was the Kenyan nemesis, John Ngugi,
collecting a record five world titles. A procession followed him out of the
Rift Valley, and Ethiopia no
w helps fuel our winters of discontent.
The BUPA-backed Durham Worldcross Challenge has done little to treat the
wounds, monopolised successively by James Kariuki (Kenya), Fita Bayesa and
Haile Gebrselassie (both Ethiopia), then Ismael Kirui (Kenya), but today
presents a chance for Andrew Pears
on and Rob Denmark.
Ngugi, now 33 and shedding pounds as he attempts a comeback for the world
championships, should surely be vulnerable, while young compatriot Simeon Rono
is not yet ready to pick up his spear. Assefa Mezgebu, who won the world junior
title at Durham this y
ear, is the one likely to thwart the Brits this time.
This may be the highest quality meeting of Scots on the country this winter -
perhaps even surpassing their own national championships. Men making the trip
south for the 9.4km event include world championship team members Tommy Murray,
Robert Quinn, and C
hris Robison, plus Ken Chapman, Peter Dymoke, Phil Mowbray, Glen Stewart,
Graeme Wight, and Stephen Wylie.
There is also a 2000m race including Clydesdale trio Des Roache, Kheredine
Idessane, and Euan Calvert, plus Frank McGowan (Racing Club).
The women's event, which features City of Glasgow pair Vikki McPherson and
Sheila Fairweather, plus marathon internationalists Allison Rose and Trudi
Thomson, will be a stern test for the Scots.
The opposition includes former world junior champion Paula Radcliffe, Geta Wami
(Ethiopia) fifth in the world cross-country this year, Elena Fidatov (Romania)
third and fourth in the last two European cross-country championships, Lyudmila
Borisova (Russia
) fifth over 1500m at the Gothenburg World Championships, and Zohra Ouaziz
(Morocco) bronze medallist at 5000m in Sweden.

<HEADLINE>Atherton called on to defy the odds again Another epic script for Captain Fantastic</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974635215</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE spotlight is on Mike Atherton again as England try to stage a sequel to
their Great Escape in Johannesburg. This time there is an outside chance of
bettering even that blockbuster, with victory a distant but none the less
lingering possibility.
They have 90 overs to survive against Allan Donald, Paul Adams and co - or one
day to score the 308 runs that would result in a remarkable fourth Test victory.
So much, as ever it seems, rests on the slim shoulders of Atherton. He was
Captain Fantastic at the Wanderers after an undefeated 185 enabled England to
draw the second Test against all odds. Now the New Year Honours List may have
to be rewritten if he ca
n produce another epic innings.
Atherton and Alec Stewart - long overdue a meaningful contribution after 16
Test innings as an opener without so much as a half-century - gave England a
solid start tonight by surviving nine overs.
But there is no doubt whose wicket South Africa want most this morning - or
which batsman England can least afford to lose.
``They've got a lot of other good players, but Atherton is their trump card,''
said home opener Gary Kirsten, whose rock-solid contribution of 69 prevented a
full-scale Springbok collapse yeterday ``If we can get him out early, it might
make a difference.
''
Atherton never needs an incentive to fight as though his life depends on the
outcome of every ball, but the performance of a depleted England attack during
South Africa's second innings will make him even more determined, if that is
possible.
Just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong during the first hour of
the fourth day at St George's Park. Far from squeezing out every last run, the
tourists lost their final three first innings wickets in 40 minutes while
adding only 13 to an o
vernight total of 250 for seven.
Then Mark Ilott's attempts to shake off a thigh strain failed before he had
sent down a single delivery. Ilott hobbled away and England were left with
three front-line bowlers.
Dominic Cork, Peter Martin and Richard Illingworth could hardly have done any
more for their side, however.
Cork, meanwhile, was at the centre of a new controversy yesterday. Having
plunged South Africa to the brink of collapse at 69 for six, he resorted to
bowling down the legside while Gary Kirsten and Shaun Pollock tried to set up a
declaration.
Cyril Mitchley eventually called Cork for a wide - and that sparked a debate
between the 57-year-old umpire and captain Mike Atherton.
Twenty-four hours earlier, Mitchley had angered England by giving Atherton out
for a non-existent catch behind. Yesterday, the pair looked close to clashing
over the umpire's interpretation of unfair play.
Mitchley said that he signalled ``wide'' simply because he thought it was out
of Pollock's reach. But the decision had been coming for some time - and that
one delivery looked no further down legside than several others.
The umpire made a point of speaking to Atherton after two balls during Cork's
previous over had given Kirsten little chance of making contact.
South Africa's left-handed opener went on to make 69, keeping alive his side's
chance of victory at St George's Park. ``Maybe it's a good idea but it just
seems like negative cricket to me,'' said Kirsten when asked about England's
tactics.
``I haven't seen it happen too often. You would think maybe they would have
wanted to bowl us out.''
South African coach Bob Woolmer added: ``It's not the greatest part of the game
of cricket but, given the situation, I can understand why it was being done.''
Asked whether his team would resort to the same tactics, Woolmer said: ``I hope
not, no.''
South Africa had recovered from their grim position by the time Cork switched
from striving for wickets to making economy his No.1 priority. ``We had to try
not to give them boundaries,'' said the all-rounder.

BY my reckoning it was Wallace and Gromit (BBC2, Sunday) by a lumpy Plasticine
head. Weeks of hype, hour after hour of ``blockbusters'', ``star-studded''
specials, and celebrity-ridden ``classics'' - in the end it came down to 30
minutes of stop-motion sl
apstick from one little man and his mutt.
Granted, even Nick Park's animated duo have become a ``tradition'' in three
years, heaven help their squishy little bodies. Granted, too, this year's A
Close Shave bore more than a passing resemblance to the prize-winning The Wrong
Trousers (itself repeat
ed last week). But for genuine invention, observation, and comic timing, the
wee chap and his canine sidekick had no competition.
Ken Russell's execrable ``musical'' Treasure Island (Channel 4, Sunday),
camping it up in that thumpingly heavy-handed style the nation has come to know
and loathe, can be passed over in silence (if only its maker had done the
same). P G Wodehouse's Heavy
Weather (BBC1, Sunday) was forgettable heritage comedy, rich in production
values and ageing actors disappearing over the top. Keeping Up Appearances and
One Foot in the Grave (both BBC1, Monday) were both dog-tired formats, as
wearying as the festival i
tself.
It's the usual debate, in other words: why is Christmas TV quite so bad?
There's plenty of it, no expense has been spared, you look forward to it for
days - but when it comes it's about as welcome as a gift-wrapped packet of
cheap cigars.
The sense of occasion that once attached itself to the TV premiere of a hit
picture has now almost disappeared and the sense of fun once to be had from
something seasonally corny, like Miracle on 34th Street (Channel 4, Sunday),
has been eroded by repetit
ion.
That said, the networks themselves are culpable. In their hands the TV
Christmas, always a delicate thing, has become a faux festival. It wouldn't be
Christmas without Eric and Ernie (BBC1, Sunday), would it? The Wind in the
Willows (ITV, Monday) is tradi
tional - God knows how - is it not?
There has to be Noel Edmonds (BBC1, Monday), surely? And Top of the Pops? And
carols? And the Queen? Tradition, that much-insulted word, is being
manufactured and used as a substitute for imagination. To be charitable, there
were good things, but only a f
ew, and they had little to do with the season. After his ``world tour of
Scotland'' Billy Connolly showed again,  A Scot in the Arctic (BBC1, Thursday),
that he might be on to something with this documentary game. Camping alone on
the roof of the world wh
ile living in fear of polar bears and frozen extremities, he was fluent and
funny, exhibiting unself-consciously his God-given, unstoppable gift of the gab.
STV's McCallum (also Thursday) had the makings of the series it doubtless aims
to become, and not just because John Hannah is as hot at the moment as young
actors get. Overcoming its own predictability, McCallum was a forensic
pathologist (ho hum) investi
gating the death of a colleague. It managed to grip for most of 90 minutes,
largely because the hero appeared to have an interior life at least as
interesting as his action-packed exterior one.
Some actors have conviction on tap, no matter how unpromising the material, and
Hannah is one. He invested the part of McCallum with more complexity than the
script alone could have allowed. He is a star in waiting.
For this column's money only Northern Exposure (Channel 4, Wednesday), making
its last appearance for this season, could touch Wallace and Gromit. The
religious event in question here was Passover, not Christmas, but it was the
best drama of the week none
the less.
The show's vice is its knowingness, its virtue the absolute self-confidence
with which the ensemble move from the real and normal to the surreal,
supernatural, and plain wacky. No matter how comic the plot there is always a
steel thread of real emotions r
unning through it all. I shall miss it.

Phil Penfold speaks to Valerie Singleton who has left the old firm behind to
host a new quiz show and add more than a touch of nostalgia  to her life
HAS it been hard to shake off the ``Aunty Val'' image? Valerie Singleton
visibly shudders and says: ``I really don't know why they called me that . . .
I mean, you never heard of `Uncle John and Uncle Peter' did you?''
However, to a generation of youngsters glued to their teatime TV sets between
1962 and 1972, Singleton will always be a slight authority, strong nostalgia
figure. ``I always thought of myself,'' she says reflectively, ``as a sort of .
. . elder sister.''
A friend of mine observed that every time he saw Singleton, he wanted to sit up
straight and look tidy. She giggles when I tell her this, and says that might
reflect rather more on the standards of television for young people today
rather than on her own
style of presentation. But there we are. Today, Singleton bounces into the room
wearing a fuschia-purple two-piece suit with a black halter-type top. The hair
is short and neatly coiffed, and she has a pair of rimless spectacles to
balance off two enormou
s silver-globe earrings and a gold rope around her neck.
Singleton may be in her mid-fifties, but she looks a good 10 years younger.
She's fit (``I try to walk everywhere - it's not unknown for me to cross London
on the way to work, as long as I'm wearing a pair of sensible shoes''), she's
busy, and she's back
on our TV screens from January 1, hosting a Channel 4 afternoon quiz show
called Backdate.
Channel 4? Isn't this a bit of a departure for the woman who was Mrs BBC for
more than two decades? Why isn't she still with the ``old firm''?
``I don't know, you'd better ask them,'' she says firmly. The truth is perhaps,
that the current state of the Corporation isn't particularly to Singleton's
taste. ``In the old days, I'd know the person at the head of a department, or
the one who was makin
g the particular programme, and we'd talk, or they'd call me, and - perhaps -
they'd think `Oh, Val can do that . . .' and I'd get the offer and away we'd
go. Now, the BBC is dependent on so many independent production companies, all
making their own pitc
h for a particular slot with a particular idea. I might be involved with just
one of those projects, and while it might get shortlisted, it won't be the
final choice. So I don't get the work. It's as simple as that.''
But let's not assume, says Singleton, that she is forever doomed to making
pilot shows that never see the light of day. No way. ``I've been doing an awful
lot of writing, some more travelling, a lot of videos, and quite a lot of
corporate presentation for
various firms,'' she explains. ``I haven't been sitting twiddling my thumbs.''
Single, she lives in South London (``with a cat called Daisy. She's very old,
so we get on well together'') and if there is anyone in her life, she's not
saying so. Her mother died not so long ago, so she tends to see her father
quite a bit. Indeed, the p
air of them spent Christmas together, ``with a few friends''. Other than that,
there is a brother and two nieces to make up the Singleton clan, and that's it.
From what she reveals, it seems that Singleton doesn't mind doing things alone.
``I like going to galleries, and museums, travelling, and if I have any
ambition at all, it's to become proficient in something,'' she says. ``I've
been doing some pretty inte
resting evening classes in architecture, art, and archaeology recently, and
they've been terrifically absorbing. In an ideal world, I'd like to win the
Lottery, go to Italy for a year and learn the language while discovering all I
can about their art and
history.''
She gives the distinct impression that she thinks herself to be the Jill of all
trades and - arguably - the mistress of none. ``I started out at Rada and
dancing school,'' she says, ``and then I went into television presentation and
did all sorts of thing
s before someone spotted me at the BBC and thought I might do rather well with
a new programme called Blue Peter.
``I'd done TV advertising programmes, which were allowed in those days, I'd
been a stage ingenue, and I'd been a hoofer. I'd never been really out of work,
but I don't think I'd ever really found my niche until Blue Peter came along.
``I even did a stage tour of Britain supporting Jessie Matthews and Sonnie Hale
in a show called Nest of Robins. By then, they'd got divorced and the
atmosphere on stage was . . er, well, sometimes rather `strained'. She was a
great trooper, however, and
I suppose I learned a lot of stage craft from her. Oh, I'd do anything back
then. Anything they offered. I even appeared in Emergency, Ward 10!''
And it seems that Singleton will do just about anything today. ``Not just
because it's offered,'' she says, ``don't make it out that I'm desperate. I'm
not. It's got to be something with a touch of originality to it. Something that
stimulates me. Hence Ba
ckdate, which I do think has the potential of a shelf-life as long as
Blockbusters or Countdown if we're lucky. The feel-good thing about this new
show is that the contestants are all such nice people. And meeting people is
very important to me. Keeping i
n touch, you see.''
People still think that she's presenting The Money Programme, PM and - even -
Tonight. ``The fact that I haven't, and for several years, doesn't seem to
matter,'' she says, ``so I just thank them for the compliment. I think that you
become such a familiar
face that it takes a long time to sink in.'' I very much enjoyed The Money
Programme in the beginning. PM had a very broad remit to begin with, we'd
review books, talk to authors, visiting artists. Then it swung entirely to news
and current affairs, and
perhaps that wasn't entirely what I wanted to do."
Backdate will ask questions about ``sport, the arts, politics, films . . .
anything. It's all to do with a particular date selected from the last 50 years
by our computer at random. It combines nostalgia and tactical skills and I
think it's great fun.''
Singleton admits that she has always kept a diary "even if it was a selection
of thoughts scribbled on hotel notepaper and it's always been a source of
amazement to me that, even when I've been working hard all day, I've seemed to
write so much.''
Life today, reflects Singleton, ``is much more uncertain. You're a freelance,
available for hire. But I think that it makes it rather more fun. I'm
deliberately trying to shift direction. I don't see me still presenting TV
shows when I'm 70 - heaven forfe
nd! By then, I think - I hope - I'll be writing full-time.''
So how does she relax? ``I'm not very good at that, I admit. But I can never
spend enough money on books,'' she says, ``and I tend to eat out a lot, because
I'm not a great cook.''
She must, I assume, be a pretty rotten person to buy for, should anyone want to
get her a gift or a Christmas present. The woman who has everything?
``I'd far rather get something practical, like a pair of tights,'' she says,
``or a #5 pocket art guide. Simple things mean so much more to me. The sad
thing about growing old is realising how little you actually need - and also
how little time you've got
left to learn about what you actually want to.''
One thing she has recently enjoyed, she reflects, was the shopping for a whole
series of new outfits for Backdate. ``I went out with a very nice lady from the
wardrobe department, and the result is that I've got some lovely frocks to
wear. This (she smoot
hs the skirt of the suit) is one of them.''
And only today, she admits, the tables have been turned as far as remembering
one particular date is concerned. ``Geoff Hurst is doing a celebrity book on
the anniversary of England winning the World Cup, so he's written to me asking
where I was on that p
articular day . . . it'll mean a trip to the diaries, I know!''
And no-one could resist asking the million-dollar question of Singleton. Has
she still got a coveted Blue Peter badge? ``I used to have two,'' she
confesses, ``but the floor manager on Backdate told me how his ambition all his
life was to get one, so I ga
ve him one of them.
"Yes, I still hold on to and treasure that little piece of personal nostalgia.
You can't escape it - ever.''

UNDER THE HAMMER
THE last Saturday of 1995 seems a good day from which to survey the activities
of the past year in the saleroom and look for possible future trends. On the
whole, buyers took a canny approach to their purchases, resolutely turning
their backs on things wh
ich had been over-enthusiastically estimated by auctioneers. As a result,
specialities which have been much vaunted in the past settled down to a far
less hysterical pace.
A good example can be found in teddy bears, which have lost a lot of their
steam. Now a decent Steiff bear can change hands at around #3000, not the five
and six figure sums they were making a couple of years ago. I'm always fairly
sceptical about astonis
hing prices unfailingly publicised by auction houses in an effort to drum up
business and enthusiasm. Are all those prices really genuine indicators? I
doubt it, for what's to stop unscrupulous collectors being under-bidders for
their own treasures? If th
ey're stuck with the goods in the end, they're paying themselves with only the
saleroom commission to find.
An example of an over-estimated bear coming unstuck occurred earlier this month
when Donald Campbell's Merrythought teddy bear, Mr Whoppit, went home unsold
after Christie's put him up for sale with a price of between #50,000 and
#60,000. Poor Whoppit is
a survivor though, his ordeal by water on Lake Coniston proves that, so we'll
probably be seeing him again.
If bears are in the doldrums, however, other toys have done reasonably well
during the year and there is a big collecting enthusiasm for everything from
Dinky cars to models of Lady Penelope. Among the notable prices were #11,375
for a pair of Japanese do
lls in silk kimonos which Christie's in London sold in June. The month before,
a Minic toy car, a Bentley Sunshine Saloon, was sold by the same auctioneers
for #3600.
Like bears however, Rock and Pop memorabilia is another area showing signs of
coming to the end of an inflationary period - things like Jimi Hendrix's
jacket, or George Harrison's spare guitar. There seems to be too much material
of meagre quality around,
but during the year there have been a few highlights such as when Cynthia
Lennon sold John's Japanese Airlines ``Happi Coat'' at Christie's in London.
She must have been as surprised as everyone else when it made #18,000, for
these coats were free gifts
from airlines for their first class passengers in the 60s and Lennon probably
left it behind with Cynthia when he went off with Yoko Ono - he himself
couldn't have set much store by it.
Another pop world surprise was a 1961 recording made by a classmate at Dartford
Grammar School of Keith Richards and Mike Jagger - the earliest known recording
of the soon-to-be famous Rolling Stones. A collector paid #50,250 for it last
May.
Specialist sales always raise good audiences with money to spend. Golf sales,
football sales and whisky sales did well in 1995 for Christie's in Glasgow. I
wonder if the buyer who paid #3900 for a bottle of Macallan Glenlivet in March
has drunk it by now?
In July, one of the stars of Christie's golf sale was an Austrian bronze figure
of a golfer wearing plus-fours which sold for #2,185, and their November
football sale realised #224,733, double the expected total. Top lot was the
Sheriff London Shield whic
h sold for an astonishing #39,000. Phillips in Edinburgh also returned very
good figures from their golf sale in July when a selection of old golf balls
made spectacular improvements on their estimates - one going as high as #19,995
when estimated at betw
een #7000 and #10,000.
As far as paintings are concerned, the Scottish Colourists spent the year
recording prices well below their previous highs, but on December 1 there was a
glimmer of hope for better days when Phillips in Edinburgh sold a Peploe
still-life of fruit and rose
s to a London dealer for #50,580. This painting had an interesting history
because it was saved from a house fire five years ago.
Another Scottish artist who never seems to have been awarded the honour she
deserves is Phoebe Anna Traquair; in October, Phillips of Edinburgh sold a
lovely copper casket made by her for the very good price of #2350 though they
had estimated at between #
500-700.
A trend for the future is the recent escalation in prices in the field of
Decorative Arts, especially William Morris style pieces dating from the turn of
the century. They have been doing very well and some very interesting things
are appearing on the mar
ket, like the embroidered table mats Phillips sold in Edinburgh for #4470
(estimated at #600), and the set of framed Morris tiles representing the
seasons of the year which made an astonishing #32,000 (estimate #12,000).
Another area that has been quietly booming is jewellery. Perhaps canny
investors are putting their cash into diamonds instead of securities.
Christie's in Glasgow reports its jewellery sales have done particularly well
over the year and among the highligh
ts were a diamond brooch sold in June for #27,600, and an emerald and diamond
ring sold for #20,700. In November they also auctioned a Hamilton and Inches
diamond tiara/necklace for #16,675.
The saleroom always throws up interesting oddities and one-offs that amuse
rather than give guidelines about where to go in the future. One such was Ian
Fleming's gold plated typewriter that Christie's sold in London for #55,750,
and a rare Kangaroo bicyc
le of 1885 that Phillips sold in Edinburgh for #8000 in August. Of course,
there's not many gold plated typewriters or Kangaroo bicycles around, so don't
waste time looking for them.
Anyone who is cleaning out old drawers or an attic over the holiday period
should keep an eye open for a few special things - like glass Christmas tree
decorations made in Germany in the 1950s. These irridescent glass balls are now
making very respectable
money, at least a couple of hundred for a good selection.
The second little money spinner might be an old fountain pen. Japanese Dunhill
Namiki's are making big money now, but don't despise your old Parker Vacumatic
because one sold last year for #220 and a mixed lot of a Swan Eternal self
filler, two Parker 51'
s, a Waterman and a Swan made #300. They were sold at Sotheby's in
Billingshurst.
Finally, don't disregard Susie Cooper's cheap and cheerful pottery. She died
this year and there's nothing like dying for raising an artist's price up.
Susie's crockery is now set to chase Clarice Cliff pottery into the high price
range.

BEAUTY BOX
ENLIGHTENED capitalism has caught on. The Body Shop is no longer the only
cosmetic company which aligns profit with principle. The Aveda Corporation,
too, are concerned with trading fairly with the environment, minority groups
and indigenous tribes under
threat from pollution or poverty. It's hard to say what's going on here.
Aveda promote a lifestyle. The premier magazine issue of Aveda, The Beauty of a
Balanced Life, is essentially a catalogue of products which range from the
Eco-Spun Mandarin-Collar Sherpa Cardigan to Volumising Dandruff Tonic. It lists
recipes for organic
produce, and features articles on modern living which draw moral conclusions -
well, produce guilt really. Cheery quotations, such as ``the end of the human
race will be that it will eventually die of civilisation'' (Ralph Waldo
Emerson), litter the pages
. Beauty advice borrows from the ancient Indian Ayurvedic tradition; Aveda say
ageing well is a matter of eating simply and being at peace with oneself.
There is no way any company would bother preaching green politics to the public
if there wasn't money to be made by consumer conversion. The environmental
evangelists don't want their account in the red. If they are scoring profit
then there is a consiste
nt and serious demand for cosmetics which also supply a philosophy of life.
This has a novelty value. If only that for centuries, the personal and touchy
area of how someone looks has been abused and ridiculed by fashion. Being
downtrodden with low-self e
steem is anti-life and anti-social. Buying goods without regard to their source
is passe . The new breed of female (and male) consumer, equates health with
beauty, beauty with contentedness, happiness with confidence.
There will come a time, where anyone who copies the anodyne images punted by
cynical women's magazines and misogynist designers, will be treated with the
same sartorial derision as those who wear shell-suits. The pursuit of
individuality, of personal evol
ution is on its way, but it will ultimately be ignored for the right-wing
discipline and intellectual rigour of convention. But each step forward, even
cancelled by two steps back, is still a way of forging a path ahead. And I
suspect Aveda are the flagsh
ip of a shift of public opinion.
They bang on about environmental issues, the way Cosmopolitan cries out rules
on how to have great sex. But Aveda's range is intended to come on as more
cerebral. There aren't chapters, there are ``domains''; there isn't perfume,
there is Pure-Fume design
ed to complement the seven Chakras.
It has to be said, that Aveda's essential-oil based essences are crackingly
exotic. Their comprehensive range of cosmetics comes in what look like real
colours, deep, strong, and free from petrochemicals. Think about it. On
average, a woman will swallow a
tube and a half of synthetic lipstick a year, which her system will never
digest. Aveda's lipstick shades are derived from plant pigment - they use
beeswax and essential oils, Vitamin E, jojoba and basil.
The company says that plants are the much-maligned saviours of the planet.
Approximately 25 per cent of commercially available prescription drugs contain
plant-derived compounds, at an annual market value of $10 million. These
natural drugs include some o
f the most important medicines in the physician's cabinet, yet less than 10 per
cent of the world's 450,000 to 750,000 plant species have been investigated as
potential sources of new drugs.
In the sixties, an effective treatment for Hodgkins Disease was found in the
rosy periwinkle from the rainforest. The drug taxol, important in treating
ovarian and breast cancer, was distilled from extracts from the Pacific Yew, a
tree found in the Pacifi
c Northwest and British Columbia. Now the National Cancer Institute in America
spends a half million dollars a year taking samples from tropical regions.
Richard Schultes PhD, of Harvard University, says: ``The caveman must have been
an Ethnobotanist, bec
ause he had to learn which plants could kill him or possibly cure some disease
or feed him.'' Like I said, sometimes you need to get into reverse gear to go
foward.

LADY CLAIRE'S KITCHEN
OH dear, another 51 weeks before it's Christmas again - I imagine some of you
must think I am quite mad! But now we look forward to the New Year. If, like
me, you have a house full of family and friends and have done so for many days
now, you may be wonde
ring about a special dish for dinner on New Year's Eve.
And you may be racking your brains to think of a dish which is special but
which doesn't take ages to make - a party type of main course made in minutes
rather than hours spent in preparation, then more in washing up; after all,
life is too short.
I thought that today we would discuss dishes suitable for entertaining when the
host or hostess is short on time, and quite possibly slightly weary. I never
get sick of having guests for Christmas and New Year, in fact I love them and I
love having the ho
use full of family and friends, but there is no escaping the fact it is quite
tiring.
We tend to have a fairly formal dinner on New Year's Eve. If you haven't
thought about the menu, start by planning the main course and arrange the first
course and pudding around that.
In an ideal world, and if I have remembered to get them and freeze them, we
would have venison fillets. They are so quick to cook - I like them undercooked
to the point of pinkness, but I do not like venison fillet cooked so rare that
the meat is red.
A simple sauce is made by cooking sliced mushrooms in butter with a dash of
sunflower oil till they are almost crisp, which improves the natural taste of
the mushrooms, then reducing Madeira and venison stock (you can substitute a
Game consomme, bought in
a can) till it has a syrupy texture - it should reduce by half to reach this
texture.
I leave the ratio of Madeira and stock to you, but half and half I find about
right. Serve with homemade redcurrant or rowan jelly. You may not have access
to venison fillet, but if you can get beef fillet there is always the classic
Beef Stroganoff, wher
e the meat is cut into little finger-thick strips, stir-fried over high heat,
then served in a reduced cream and brandy sauce.
But the recipe today is very simple and quick to make. To a certain extent it
can be prepared in the morning, needing only no more than five minutes cooking
that evening before dinner. Its great plus point is that it is versatile in its
main ingredient. I
have made this dish using monkfish, chicken breasts, or pheasant breasts: it
would be equally good with turkey breasts or pork fillet.
It has a simple and attainable collection of ingredients - leeks, ginger,
garlic, mustard and creme fraiche. One of the most helpful things to use for
this dish is a large saute pan.
What you serve with it depends to a certain extent on the main ingredient. For
instance, if you are using a firm-fleshed fish such as monkfish, or prawns,
then I would choose rice to accompany it. On the other hand, with a meat or
fowl version you could j
ust as well have potatoes cut in large chunks and roasted in olive oil, with or
without garlic, and with a good dusting of paprika in the roasting tin, and any
steamed or microwaved vegetable, such as sprouts - if you haven't had them too
often recently -
spinach, or sugar snap peas.
For a first course you could have smoked fish, either smoked trout, salmon, or
eel. Or, if you have the time and inclination, you could make a smoked fish
mousse or pate.
For pudding anything lemony is a good contrast to the first two courses,
possibly a straightforward lemon mousse, or a baked lemon pudding, or lemon
sorbet. If you happen to have any egg whites in your fridge, it takes very few
minutes to make a vanilla p
avlova, on which you could spread lemon curd and whipped cream.
If you use bought lemon curd sharpen it up with grated lemon rind and just
enough lemon juice, taking care not to let it become too runny. Making your own
lemon curd takes six minutes cooking in the microwave, giving the ingredients
two minutes on high, t
hen a good whisk, and repeating twice more. Assembling the ingredients for
lemon curd doesn't take long either. I use the grated rind and juice of two
lemons to one whole egg, plus two yolks, from large eggs, 3 oz butter cut in
bits, and 3oz caster sugar.
This has a sharp taste and would cover a pavlova which would feed eight.
NEW YEAR FILLET
n Monkfish, or Prawns, or Chicken, or Pork Fillet, or Pheasant in mustard and
creme fraiche sauce.
Serves 6-8
2lbs of whatever meat you use, sliced neatly into even pieces - about one inch
thick for fish, smaller for pheasant, pork fillet or chicken - or into
finger-thick strips
2 tablespoons of sunflower oil or olive oil
1oz butter
3 good sized leeks, washed, trimmed and sliced thinly
one inch of fresh ginger, pared of its skin and finely chopped
1 clove of garlic, skinned and finely chopped (optional)
1 tablespoon good grainy mustard, though use less if vinegary
1 teaspoon flour
2 pots (200ml) creme fraiche
Salt, pepper to taste.
Heat the oil and melt the butter together in a saute pan. Cook the sliced
leeks, ginger, and garlic together till the leeks are soft. You can do this in
the morning. Cut up the fish or fowl or pork in the morning. Scoop the cooked
leeks out of the saute p
an into a warm dish, and cook the fish or meat over a fairly high heat,
stirring all the time. As the pieces turn opaque they are cooked - that is why
it is so important to cut the pieces so small.
Replace the cooked leeks and ginger in with the fish or meat, stir in the
flour, let it cook for a few seconds then stir in the creme fraiche and
mustard. Let the sauce bubble for a minute, taste and season with salt pepper.
You can keep this warm, in a c
overed dish at low temperature in the oven, but not for too long.

A SLICE OF LIFE
n.Jimmie Macgregor talks to Leila Farrah about a typical day's eating
LEFT to my own devices I would treat food as something to be done quickly
before getting back to work, but I appreciate the skill and patience that goes
into preparing a good meal.
For donkey's years I could never face breakfast so I'd go out on three or four
cups of tea. On tour you'd come off stage, it's party time and you're up half
the night, so you don't get up for 7.30 breakfast the next day but use room
service instead.
Quite often I'd go through the whole day without food, but by drinking the
worst kind of tea that's bad for your nervous system and sex life, full of
tannin, lots of sugar. There was a fair alcohol intake as well - bad stuff
this, but I'm being honest - a
nd you got high calories from that. And I'd have my main meal of the day at
11pm - never before going on stage because it slows you down. Absolutely stupid.
Just recently I realised the difference between my waist and chest measurements
was diminishing. So now I eat - and I hate the word - a little muesli in the
morning, tea with less sugar, and I enjoy peppermint tea.
I won't have lunch unless I'm at a function and they always give you salmon
which I find rather boring. I prefer Gravadlax or even tinned salmon - I love
the texture of the wee bones when you crunch them. A good herring has 20 times
the flavour of most sa
lmon I come across at functions. You used to be able to walk across Loch Fyne
over the herring, it would teem with them. Fish stocks are being raided now.
If I cook for myself it's haddock or monkfish from McCallums, that lovely fish
shop on Kelvinbridge, and potatoes. I'll eat a little fruit if I'm hungry
during the day. And when I'm filming and out walking, we carry food like
chicken legs and sandwiches.
Cakes and biscuits bore me, especially chocolate cake.
I like to eat Asian: at the Ashoka, the Shish Mahal and the Creme de la creme
but I eat nothing to hot because that kills the flavour. It's like drinking
high octane whisky with no water - you only get the burn. I'm getting bored
with Chinese food, but I'
m fond of Indonesian.
I appreciate the delicacy and aesthetics of Japanese food which is out of
character with me because I'm dead coarse and just grab stuff. When I was a
little kid, a local grocer used to make a gigantic, absolutely delicious
clootie dumpling - three feet ac
ross and 18 inches high. I'd buy a slice with my pocket money, take it home and
fry it. My father told me once he'd seen the wee shop cleaner washing the
windows and standing on the dumpling in her stockinged feet...... that didn't
stop me.

IT can cost as much as a package holdiday in Spain; in fact it may even cost
more, given the spectacular deals currently offered by travel companies.
Nevertheless, a camping holiday in Brittany can provide a welcome change of
pace and culture for those wh
o are becoming disenchanted with the increasingly grotesque features of some
Mediterranean resorts.
Camping is a quality business in France and facilities are invariably of a
higher standard than can be found in Britain. Serious campers from Germany, the
Netherlands, Scandinavia, and France itself have fastidious tastes and high
standards must be mainta
ined.
Having camped in various parts of the United Kingdom, the sites provided by
Eurocamp along the stunning and unspoiled coastline of Brittany offer a series
of pleasant surprises.
As regular visitors to Brittany will testify, the beaches are magnificent -
clean, uncrowded, and yet easily accessible by car.
Sites are well managed and, in turn, owners expect responsible behaviour. No
lager louts here. Staff are unobtrusively helpful and locals are unfailingly
courteous and kind.
There is always a bonjour and au revoir from shop assistants and cafe and bar
staff. No-one is ignored. One longs for a similar civilised attitude here in
the UK.
This particular Eurocamp holiday begins with a memorable Brittany Ferries
crossing to Cherbourg from Poole in Dorest - surely one of the most spectacular
harbours anywhere.
As the gorgeous Dorset coastline unfolds to starboard, from the the Old Harry
Rocks at Studland and sweeping on past Swanage to Weymouth in the far distance,
we wonder why we should be leaving.
However, the memory of incredibly busy roads, parking pressures, and the sheer
vulgarity of some of the holiday areas turns our thoughts to the promised
quality and quietude of the Brittany camping holiday.
A two-day stopover in a handsomely-appointed Eurocamp mobile home at Chateau de
Galinee yields a first taste of North Brittany which has some of the most
spectacular coastline in France, along with a wealth of splendid, uncrowded
sandy beaches.
The inland site is barely ten minutes from the Cote d'Emeraude, a beautiful
stretch of jagged coastline, west of the smart modern resort of Dinard.
However, our interest was focused on the smaller, but popular resort of St Cast
whose Grand Plage is one of
the largest sandy beaches in the region.
It is also incredibly scenic. From the northern tip of Pointe de St Cast there
are stunning views of the Emerald Coast. The rugged Fort La Latte can be seen
brooding to the north west. Strengthened in the 17th century, it has stood on
its rocky promontory
for over one thousand years.
Of equal interest is Cap Frehel, one of the most outstanding features of the
Emerald Coast. The great lighthouse, whose beacon can be seen for nearly 100
miles in good weather, dominates the landscape. The cliffs here are 100 metres
high and their dull pi
nk colouring provides a startling contrast on a fine day with the emerald sea
and white surf.
Sprinkled liberally among the cliff formations are delightful, smaller sandy
beaches which we had a closer look at while sampling another Eurocamp Mobile at
nearby Le Chatelet. This is a larger, family-orientated site, in a dream site
overlooking the bay.
Despite being much busier with many more camping pitches, our stay was
nethertheless enjoyable, with campers affording each other mutual respect and
consideration.
For a day trip, the spectacular Mont-St-Michel, the 13th Century Benedictine
Abbey 40 miles to the north, is de rigueur. Built on a rock surrounded by sand
flats, the abbey and town has been described as ``the wonder of the western
world''.
On the day of our visit it seemed the rest of the western world was there to
share the experience. It was a veritable ant hill of tourists, with barely room
to squeeze past each other in the narrow, winding streets. Still, it should be
seen.
Even more family-orientated was our third Eurocamp site, 90 miles further south
at La Trinite-sur-Mer, the internationally-acclaimed yachting centre in the
heart of Quiberon Bay where ocean racers dominate the huge town-centre marina.
A mile out of town, Camping de La Plage offers a family holiday with direct
access to a fine sandy beach and, like the other two sites, a swimming pool
with play facilities.
The number of campers is high, but again the considerate behaviour of the
hundreds of campers meant a high activity family holiday and peacful, relaxing
break, were not incompatible.
Amazingly for such a crowded site, things get very quiet after 10pm. Is
everyone in bed? Not likley. A stroll around the site reveals almost every
family gathered around their anti-insect candles and bottles of wine, topping
off the late meal with some ci
vilised conversation. Children were tremendously well behaved and, again, no
lager louts.
Perhaps the only negative feature was the five o'clock alarm call provided by a
demented, and seemingly lonely, cockerel on a neighbouring property. Not
everyone on site appreciated this service.
``Lovely site, but I could choke that cockrel,'' a fellow camper declared.
Eurocamp mobile homes sleep up to six and are equipped with cooker, barbeque,
fridge, toilet and shower facilities. Tents, also with cooker and fridge
facilities, are also available. In addition, the camp sites visited had superb
toilet and washing facili
ties.
Special basins are set aside for washing clothes and dishes, and baby baths are
provided. The site washing machines and ironing rooms may be a harsh reminder
of home but are a Godsend for those who don't want to pack too many cases.
South Brittany offers the visitor a charming blend of old and new. It is an
area rich in local traditions and culture, yet its vibrant coastal resorts
attract visitors from all over Europe.
The coastline ranges from the ``cote sauvage'' of Quiberon to small sheltered
coves and ports offering boat trips to off-shore islands.
Generally, the region is relatively unspoilt and the picturesque villages and
old quarters of towns, such as Auray, Vannes and Nantes, are well worth
visiting, especially on markets days.
While there is an ample spread of supermarkets and hyper-markets to meet the
routine supply needs of campers, local markets provide a fascinating insight
into local culinary and craft traditions. The one at La Trinite sure Mer was
set up once a week in th
e car park of the local supermarket - a situation we couldn't imagine being
replicated in this country.
An astonishing range of strange-looking potted meats, pates, and bakery
products was being vigorously marketed, with stallholders proffering samples to
hesitant tourists. Fresher than fresh fish from the bay were being gutted and
sold on the spot.
Animal rights zealots would perhaps have have frowned on the cages of Breton
Spaniels being offered for sale.
This is cider-producing country, and so the wine connoisseur has to consider a
day trip to the Loire Valley to access the nearest local vintage. However, the
cider, either flat or sparkling, is an excellent accompaniment to savoury
crepes and the wide ran
ge of sea food that is available almost straight from the harbour.
Poultry, mainly free-range, is of excellent quality, and may be supplemented if
action is taken against that demented cockerel at La Trinite-sur-Mer.
n.A 14-night stay in a Eurocamp mobile home for two adults and four children
during the high season will cost around #1200. All under-18s are free but each
additional adult requires a supplement of #95.

TO get away with naming a Glasgow restaurant Froggies, you would surely have to
be French. The British more tactfully or more pretentiously would call it Les
Grenouilles. At any rate, Froggies is indeed that rarity in Scotland, a French
restaurant which i
s genuinely French, yet which is not, apparently, just another offshoot of
Pierre Victoire.
It is French enough, moreover, to have a chef from Marseilles and a proprietor
from Toulouse, though after that the resemblance between Froggies and a French
restaurant - a French French restaurant of the sort you find in France - begins
to falter.
The decor, though Frenchified with posters, atmospheric photographs, and lots
of global lighting, cannot conceal the fact that the personality of this large,
lofty space in Glasgow's business centre is basically lounge-bar or possibly
steak-house British.
The colour gamut ranging from beige to brown with a patterned red carpet is no
more than marginally cheered up by tricolour pennants dangling above your head.
On a quiet day, the mood is glum.
But the staff at least seem pleased to see you, even if nobody bothers to bring
you that fundamental French restaurant requisite, a basket of bread. About the
Frenchness of the menu, however, there can be no doubt, even if - or
particularly as - the three
-course set lunch at #9.95 and dinner at #12.95 are of the brusque ``menu
touristique'' type. But if poulet chasseur is not to your taste, the  la carte
menu provides an escape route, with its emphasis on regional dishes and the
promise, you may hope, of
a dash more flair.
The fish soup which comes at the incredibly low price of #2.15, with bowls of
cheese, crispy toast, and a passable rouille, certainly has the tang of
authenticity you would expect of a restaurant that has someone from Marseilles
at the helm. This is good
enough to make you consider escalating another time to the bouillabaisse at the
more predictable price of #16.95. Choucroute and cassoulet, rather less
expensive, are among the options, but the confit de canard last week proved a
depressingly dim represen
tation of the real thing.
A limp piece of duck, with slithery skin and stringy flesh, seemed a poor shot
at a dish which the Auberge, Edinburgh's leading French restaurant, gets
absolutely right, and the accompanying omni-purpose vegetables - potatoes,
carrots, mange-touts - were
no compensation. The wine list is uninvitingly perfunctory, and the house white
much too sweet.
In self-tribute, Froggies does incorporate frog's legs among its starters. But
what is to be expected of Duck's at the Marche Noir? The fractured name is a
clumsy extension of what used to be, more simply and snappily, the Marche Noir.
As for the restaura
nt itself, on the northern fringe of Edinburgh's New Town, this, too, has been
extended, so that what was once a somewhat forlorn entrance bar has been
renovated to form a section of the restaurant itself.
Unfortunately, none of the changes quite works. What used to look forlorn still
looks rather forlorn, and what used to be a neat name now seems guaranteed to
puzzle newcomers who might arrive expecting duck (if not ducks or duck's) to be
the restaurant's
theme, along the lines of the famous duck restaurant in Warsaw which, when it
runs out of duck, has to close its doors.
But no, though the menu includes a token duck dish, the name is that of the
proprietor, Malcolm Duck, and the aim is at least partly to degallicise what
never has been a genuinely French restaurant anyway. So now we are greeted with
such printed absurditi
es as ``Le Lunch'', ``Le Dinner'', ``Le Desert'', and ``Le Coffee'', and the
menu, though listed as ever in elaborate French, now incorporates an English
translation on a separate page.
Perhaps because the cooking falls into that zone where the ingredients are
Scottish but the style French, the hybrid menu -  la carte at lunchtime,
#19.50, three-course prix fixe in the evening - can be claimed to justify
itself. But except for the fact
it saves the staff from having to explain the dishes to the customers, it does
all seem rather a waste of effort. The food produced by the young Scottish
chef, if you are not by then too exasperated to eat it, is, rather good.
True, my pheasant last week came with tiny shallots rather than with the more
interesting caramelised apples that were promised both in French and English,
but the meat was nicely moist. The preceeding timbale of prawns and crab was
sabotaged by its vineg
ary artichoke accompaniment but there was a good crme brulee to finish with,
even if it was overwhelmed by the gigantic plate it was served on.
The wine list - a battleground between France and the New World - is skillfully
assembled and not overpriced. This is a restaurant whose intentions could be
said to conquer its pretensions, and whose smart service makes up for its
mishaps. But at times on
ly just.

Pests are food
for thought
KNOW your enemy. Pond Cottage on a pale winter afternoon sets a deceptively
peaceful scene. Sheep are grazing in a field across the road. Two deer,
startled by the car, leap the fence and run for the trees. Buzzards cry
overhead on their lunchtime flight
above the open ground we haven't got round to planting. A small grey vole
scarpers in fright as I'm digging the last of the potatoes. At dusk rabbits
help themselves to what's left of the vegetable garden.
Like the gardeners in the last two articles in this series we want a garden
full of wildlife. Our pond is big but dying from silt and nitrate suffocation,
so I envy Matt Smith's lively haven for frogs and newts in the middle of
Glasgow. Our plot, sliced f
rom farmland, is too exposed to welcome many birds yet, and I know we will have
to wait a long time to create anything like the sheltered intimacy of Rosemary
Wilkes' mature garden in East Lothian.
In the meantime, we are learning that not all wildlife is welcome. Especially
if it is not really wild. Deer, voles, even rabbits, still cause an involuntary
pleasure but only the buzzard is on our side. Buzzards eat rabbits and knowing
who eats what is t
he secret of survival for any future trees and shrubs we intend to plant.
The gardener is at the top of the food chain but who would know it looking at
the havoc caused in my garden after a day or two of hungry visitors? Stray
sheep have devoured the best part of #100 worth of healthy new stock planted in
early November when th
e soil was still warm enough to get the roots off to a good start. On the
advice of the nursery, I did not bother with tree shelters as rabbits and deer
have not caused much damage to the hedgerow established two years ago. In the
ideal world trees grow s
tronger and fitter without shelters which can create a microclimate for weeds,
voles and all manner of leaf-eating insects.
But in the ideal world there are no marauding sheep to crop the silver birch
plantation, munch the sweet briar hedge and polish off the guelder rose and
cotoneaster. They left the mint but that is no compensation for the loss of
time, effort - and expecta
tions. At least half of the pleasure of planting is the picture you see in your
mind's eye as you dig. Instead of this weedy, wind-swept bank there is the
future tree-lined footpath where local people walk on their way to the village:
silver birch mixed w
ith holly and juniper to shelter the garden from the prevailing wind and frame
the view from the kitchen window.
The holly and juniper suffered only a mild nibbling but I will have to start
again with the silver birch and it will be spring before I know whether the
rose hedge will send up new shoots. I chose roses to separate the newly sown
lawn from the path leadin
g to the pond and wood. Rosa rubiginosa grows fast, produces pink roses in
summer and big, cheerful hips in winter. It seemed suited to a cottage garden
and at #45 for 15 metres it was a third of the price of yew. But yew is deadly
poisonous to livestock
which now makes it seem an excellent investment.
Revenge is meat. I've been eating a lot of lamb lately but maybe it is not a
good idea to increase demand and stimulate supply. Over-production is what
causes most of our problems in the first place, according to the botanist
Oliver Rackham in the History
of the British Countryside. As Rackham tells it, rabbits, introduced in the
12th century to produce meat on poor grazing land, were once delicate things
which could hardly dig their own burrows. They did not become a pest until the
19th century when tast
es changed and since then a combination of myxomatosis and evolution have
produced a robust, anti-social, surface-living brute.
Likewise deer, the greatest threat to the future of Scottish woodlands, have
increased to unnaturally large populations limited only by starvation and
poaching. ``It is hardly good even for deer themselves,'' says Rackham, ``that
so much excellent meat sh
ould be running round the countryside not properly used.'' And as for ravaging
sheep: ``The simplest conservation measure of all is three strands of barbed
wire.'' Presumably, he doesn't mean around the neck.
IN fact, we have good strong stock fencing round most of the site except for an
unnoticed weak spot along the roadside where only two strands of wire run along
the top of a stone wall. But all this is a timely lesson as we are applying for
a Woodland Gran
t Scheme grant to plant another 2000 native trees - without shelters. I'm sure
Rackham is right about the barbed wire but he has equally uncompromising views
on ``automatic and unintelligent'' tree planting which he says is mistakenly
confused with conser
vation on the basis of advice limited to ``native trees good, exotic bad with
inaccurate lists of native species''. The best trees for wildlife are ancient,
coppiced - or dead if people can be persuaded not to tidy them away.
Woods are not the same as gardens however. Our plantation is an attempt to
create a sheltered corridor between ``unnatural'' farmland and the remnants of
an old woodland with a lot of garden along the way. The selection includes wild
cherry (because it lo
oks nice and attracts birds) alder, willow and downy birch for damp ground, and
silver birch and Scots Pine for drier more exposed areas. We lose eco-points
because the trees are not grown from locally collected seeds so they are not
genetically programme
d for survival in our area (we have not yet found a local source although the
pressure group Reforesting Scotland is working on a register of such nurseries).
Halfway through a Scotvec course in conservation management, one of the
valuable lessons I have learned is that in conservation there are no simple
definitions, easy solutions or firm conclusions to be drawn about the outcome
of our actions. Despite exoti
c species, town gardens have become a richer source of wildlife than much of
our countryside - most of Britain's amphibeans live in garden ponds and the
despised Leyland Cyprus can make a wonderful home for spiders and nesting birds.
As far as our garden is concerned we won't be around to see ancient trees but
we have plenty of dead wood and much of it is going to stay, (festooned,
perhaps, with climbing roses and clematis). A large dead ash above the pond
drums to the sound of tappin
g woodpeckers. Coppicing ash is part of the future plan to produce timber for
the garden and firewood for the house as well as a thriving habitat for birds
and insects.
But existing trees are on the wrong side to prevent the prevailing wind
sweeping across the grass and battering at the windows. That's where the silver
birch comes in. Birch provides a beautiful, fast growing shelter which filters
the wind more effectivel
y than a solid barrier and (according to the conservation group Highland
Birchwoods) is just about as native as you can get.
I also fancy an exotic evergreen or two, along with yews and junipers, to
create that comforting sense of security near the house. Pass the mint sauce.

D  is for Debris, of which there will be plenty come the cold light of Ne'erday.
E  is for Endless, the perfect adjective to describe revelry uniquely without
time limits.
F  is for First Foot, who should be a tall, dark, handsome stranger - but more
often is just plain strange.
G  is Ghastly and Grim. Two adjectives which describe many, many Hogmany
parties. (Make a note in your diary of doors to avoid next time around).
H  is much more likely to stand for Hangover than Haggis - usually reserved for
next month's Burns Night bonanza.
I  is for Inebriated, a posh-ish word used by men in uniform to describe the
condition of Hogmany's most committed revellers.
J  must surely stand for Jimmy Shand, without whose lovely music no New Year
celebration can be considered complete.
K  is for Kissing. Yes; there's always plenty of that.
L  could stand for Liver Failure (if you overdose on the W). Do try to make it
stand instead for Life Assessment; Hogmany is a great time for con-templation.
M  is for those same old Marvelous Memories which gush from old Uncle Arthur's
mind whenever his mouth is in constant contact with a glass.
N  stands for Neighbours, to whom you may very well never normally speak. But,
hey . . . isn't New Year the time to break the ice.
O  is for Open House. The problem with hosting any Hogmany party is that you
really don't get to choose the guests.
P  stands for Pipers. As the old year slips into the new, anyone who has ever
pressed a chanter to their lips feels an inexplicable desire to mark the
moment. Discordantly.
Q  is for Queasy (lethal mixtures of B, S and W do take their toll).
R  is, of course, for Rikki Fulton. Like the Reverend I. M Jolly, make New Year
a time for Reflection and Resolution too.
S  stands for Shortbread and Stovies. And, if you're very lucky, maybe just a
little Smoked Salmon.
T  is for tartan. Absolutely the only thing to wear.
U  is for Ulcer. Oh dear. Overdone it again, haven't you?
V  will neither stand for Violence nor Vandalism. Hopefully.
W  must be for Whisky, the essential libation of the great celebration.
X  denotes that drinking and driving is an absolute No, No, No.
Y  is for Year-end. Oh, just remembered what all this nonsence is actually
about.
Z? Well, Zzzzzzzzzzzz is the only sound heard as Scotland sleeps right through
Ne'erday.

SOCIOLOGY
St. MARY'S HAMILTON: A Social History, 1846 - 1996
John Donald, #9.95
HOW fared these immigrants from Ireland and Italy who arrived at ports and
railway stations with rosaries in their battered suitcases and the hope in
their hearts that they would find prosperity and religious tolerance in
Scotland?
The answers may be found in Hamilton, according to Thomas Devine, which is why
the deputy principal and professor of Scottish history at Strathclyde
University, hailed as one of the best historians of his generation, devoted
precious time to editing a soc
ial history (from 1846 to 1996) of St Mary's Church, Hamilton. He also happens
to be a parishioner of St Mary's.
As far as Devine knows, there has never been a local in-depth study done for
any Presbyterian, Episcopalian or Roman Catholic community in Scotland, or
indeed in England.
``Normally when you get a 150th anniversary of such places you're going to get
a parish pump history which emphasises the clergy and talks about great names
and is all uncritical, based on people's recollections and deeply nostalgic and
sentimental. This
is a full-scale scholarly study done by people who are historically trained and
they are looking at it in a critical way.
``They are also locking it into issues of modern historiographical concern,
such as sectarianism, such as the issue of assimilation. What happens to Irish
immigrants and their second, third and fourth generation descendants in
relation to attitudes to Sco
tland and to Ireland? Another issue is the enormous changes that have occurred
in Catholicism over the past 20 or 30 years.''
In the book, Martin J Mitchell points out that the immigration of Irish
Catholics to the west of Scotland from the mid-1790s placed the Catholic Church
under immense pressure. ``The church was not wealthy and could only send
priests to the region when the
y became available. Chapels were erected only when sufficient funds had been
collected to begin construction, and where there was a congregation large
enough to be able, through its weekly contributions, to help repay the money
borrowed to complete the bu
ilding.''
In September 1843, John Scanlan, an Irish priest who had come to Scotland the
previous year, arrived in Hamilton to establish a mission.
There was ground available, but no money to begin building. Scanlan began
fund-raising, but in April 1845 absconded with the money, ``leaving a great
deal of debt in Hamilton''. His successor, James Purcell, also an Irishman,
began a new collection, and a
600-seat chapel and a priest's house opened in November 1846. Soon it would
not be big enough.
There were 746 Catholics in Hamilton in 1851; by 1857 there were 1411. The
Glasgow Free Press of November 1852 claimed that ``whilst a few live as
brokers, the great majority support life by vending delph, fish, whiting, or
exchanging them to the country
people for rags, bones, old iron, etc''. But the massive increase of Catholics
in and around Hamilton and at Quarter between 1851 and 1857 was almost
certainly caused by the growth of coal mining in these areas.
Gradually, over a hundred years, Irish immigrants to Hamilton and other
industrial areas emerged from the claustrophobia of the pits and the din of the
factories into the light of opportunity and social mobility.
Devine says: ``The other reason why this is a very interesting study is that
this is the first- ever time anyone has come to grips with that very
fascinating phenomenon, the rise of the Catholic middle class, essentially
created by the post-1945 education
al changes. Hardly any of these individuals who belonged to that class are
involved in business. An enormous number of them are involved in education,
particularly school teaching, and there are elements inevitably in areas like
accountancy, law and medic
ine.
``This is probably the first generation where you can actually say: we do have
a middle class Catholic population, and there are probably only about four or
five parishes left in Scotland to which this description can be applied.''
What are the politics of a parish like St Mary's? Joseph M Bradley, who
contributes three chapters to the book, conducted a general survey of Catholic
church-attenders in 1990 which showed that almost 60% of St Mary's parishioners
were Labour supporters.
How did they view the prospect of an independent Scotland? ``About a fifth of
St Mary's respondents either believed that a Northern Ireland situation would
be created where the Protestant population dominated the Catholics, and
excluded them from many are
as of social, economic and political life. A number of respondents also feared
for Catholic schools,'' Bradley writes. However, 68% of St Mary's respondents
believed Scotland should be understood  better or have an Assembly.
Italians as well as Irish emigrated in significant numbers to Scotland,
bringing recipes for ice cream, a veneration for the sanctity of the family,
and a dedication to hard work. The Di Mambro family arrived here around 1919
and went to St Mary's Parish
about 1926/27 where they rented a local cafe and eventually involved themselves
in ice-cream wholesale.
As Bradley records: ``The grandchildren of the original Di Mambros prove an
interesting case in assessing contemporary Italian identity. A sense of their
heritage is maintained by way of their forenames: all have Italian names, and
all are conscious of th
eir `Italianness'. The Italians, like the Irish, sometimes found themselves
discriminated against in Scotland because of their religious beliefs. A St
Mary's parishioner recalled: ``In the past it was atrocious. If there was a job
vacant, no Catholic need
apply.'' And Bradley records that ``almost half of St Mary's church-attenders
believe discrimination in favour of Protestants is a social reality in
Scotland''.
What is the state of the Catholic religion in Scotland after the long struggle
to establish itself here? ``Every church in Scotland is losing support, and
statistically the Catholic Church is losing support in terms of the people
attending mass,'' Devine
says. ``But it's losing support at a lesser rate of knots than other
denominations.''
After Hamilton there will be more in-depth studies of the Irish in Scotland,
because Devine has helped to establish the Irish-Scottish Academic Initiative,
which links Aberdeen and Strathclyde Universities, and Trinity College, Dublin.
Devine is negotiati
ng a separate connection through his research centre at Strathclyde with the
Londonderry campus of the University of Ulster. ``The idea is to try to
understand the two societies in terms of this long historical connection.''

THE moon hung in the night sky like a great orange pumpkin, brushed by spindly
palm trees. We drove through the city outskirts, glimpsing, here, djellaba'd
figures and camels, there, the frontages of modern hotels. My Moroccan
neighbour stretched my resid
ual French to breaking point, probing my views on astrology.
Soon we seemed to have left the city entirely behind. There were mud walls to
our right and the low buildings of a traditional village. We swung into the
grounds of the Hotel Tikida and out of the bus into the scented midnight air.
So this was Marrakesh (
or Marrakech as the French have it).
The journey from humdrum London to this fabled place had taken eight hours or
so and two hops by Royal Air Maroc: first from London to Casablanca - where
travellers automatically scan each other for the lineaments of Bergman and
Bogart, such is the potenc
y of cinematic legend - and thence to the city beside the Atlas Mountains.
The mountains would prove totally elusive in the next three days, lost
somewhere in the haze. They must be startlingly beautiful. Daylight revealed
much else to admire close at hand. The hotel itself - just one of Marrakesh's
choice of sybaritic berths -
has the air of a palace, built as it is in traditional colonnaded style round
gardens overflowing with flowering shrubs, reflected in a pool. It seemed
almost crass to use the last for mere swimming. A fountain played in the main
reception hall, an indoor
water hazard for the clumsy-footed. Carpets, wallhangings, the great vases of
fresh roses all spoke of a culture confident in its own standards and vitality.
The occasion for our visit was Marrakesh's thirty-fourth National Festival of
Popular Art. Each summer it draws a cosmopolitan audience, attracted this year
also by an international tourism fair. The fair centre milled with visitors,
sipping sweet mint te
a and munching sweetmeats in the many trade booths. The Minister of Tourism
announced to the throng (in French, naturally) that ``tourism is the locomotive
of development''. The traditional befezzed band played. Soft drinks flowed. We
exited under giant p
ictures of Morocco's monarch, Hassan II, and his two sons.
It would be a long night. For we were heading for the El-Badi Palace in the
heart of the old medina. Floodlit, the palace's walls seemed out of some
Brobdingnagian film set. The storks' nests on the battlements strengthened the
impression of unreality. Un
der a starry, moonlit sky we were ushered into our tiered places, each
clutching a prickly, long-stemmed rose. The moon swung across the sky in the
next three hours as a dazzling succession of dancers, musicians, and actors
from Morocco's varied kingdom o
f some 26 to 28 million people, performed a series of tableaux.
Tableaux should not suggest something static. Gorgeously arrayed women dancers,
with multicoloured silks billowing, and curious back strappings, swayed and
gyrated. The singing was mesmeric, though the sound is produced back in the
throat in a way very di
fferent from western techniques. Princely figures on white horses and camels
came and went. Rifles were fired. Blanks no doubt, but the audience of
thousands jumped communally. A French commentary of impenetrable eloquence
accompanied the action. We stumb
led out, overwhelmed by the sheer exoticism of the scene.
A second evening's entertainment saw hundreds of people feast on lamb and
Moroccan wine under giant awnings leading down to a little lake. It had a
backdrop of traditional buildings and palm trees. In this oasis under the North
African sky, reality again
proved elusive. The palm trees and buildings moved as on casters. Gauzy figures
glided over the lake in boats like Arabic ladies of Shalott. We learned why
Marrakesh children don't eat doves. It's because of the saintly Fatima who was
a legend by day, a d
ove by night. The city's great twelfth-century Koutoubia mosque - the city's
outstanding landmark - was built near her tomb.
Red is the official colour of Marrakesh (a city of some 1.4 million people) but
really it should be the warm rose of its old walled town - a contrast to the
wide boulevards the French bequeathed from the decades of their protectorate,
from 1912 to 1956.
A sortie to the city's souks is mandatory. - though for someone brought up in
the proprieties of resale price maintenance, the obligation to bargain is
irksome.In the narrow lanes, crammed with locals and tourists, the contents of
the little shops and boo
ths spill onto the minimal walking space. Men turn wood with curious little
foot implements. Gorgeous carpets in abstract patterns (designed as wall
hangings rather than for pedestrian use), brasswear and pottery, ornate silver
jewellery, traditional robe
s for men and women, and pointed-toed
leather slippers out of The Arabian Nights - these were just some of the things
to catch the eye in the melee.
``Ecosaisse! Ecosaisse!'' some small boys shouted after me. ``How observant of
them,'' I thought, till I realised my straw hat sported the motto ``Bell's
Scottish Open.'' Another urchin stroked a lizard and demanded payment for
posing for a picture. Be pr
epared to be importuned.
The snake charmer exercises his slippery charges in the Djemaa-el-Fna, the
great main square in the old part of town. No temptation to linger here. As on
the streets of modern Marrakesh - where young women in western dress ride past
on Vespas while contem
poraries hide behind veils on the pavements nearby - one is aware of the clash
of cultures. It is not necessarily a comfortable feeling.
So many sights of Marrakesh remain to be explored. There is the legendary Hotel
La Mamounia with its art deco mirrors and furnishings and acres of gardens.
Churchill used to escape here during the Second World War. It's certainly beats
10 Downing Street.
The Jardin Menara, with its large, still pool among olive groves, is the most
easily reached of Marrakesh's green spaces.
Morocco's monarch is a golf enthusiast - which may help account for two
impressive courses boasted by the city. The Palmeraie Golf Palace has a new
course built by Robert Trent Jones junior. Its clubhouse and hotel have opulent
interiors in traditional Mo
roccan style. The complex looks like the stamping ground of multi-millionaires
but in fact tariffs are surprisingly reasonable.
The course is green and seems to stretch to the horizon, punctuated by palm
trees and water hazards. The Royal Golf Club is in total contrast. Built in the
1920s, it has narrow fairways enclosed by trees and shrubs. Eisenhower played
on it. So, apparently
did Churchill, with the fabled Pasha of Marrakesh, El Glaoui, as his opponent.
Players tee off to a profusion of bird song.
It would take a long time to tire of Marrakesh - which has, among its numerous
other charms, a dry healthy climate with no tormenting mosquitoes. However, we
took a hurl to the seaside - to the Atlantic town of Essaouira (formerly
Mogador). Journeying thr
ough the western Sahara was almost as good as arriving. No featureless desert
this but a place of shrubby hills and valleys and strange little forts and
sudden patches of cultivation. Goats might be spied up trees eating foliage.
Enigmatic swathed figures
(shepherds?) stalked the middle distance or squatted by the roadside. In one
little oasis town I bought a wooden box of dominoes from a shy teenage boy. The
price pleased us both.
Essaouira had all the breeziness of a Troon or Ardrossan - though the
Livingstone daisies in the flowerbeds are the outsize variety that grow round
Portuguese lighthouses. In fact, the Portuguese built a fort here, there was a
flourishing Jewish community
as late as the 1960s (it evaporated in the wake of the Six Days' War), and
Orson Welles filmed part of Othello against one of its old gateways.
The bleaching sunlight was lovely to walk in; the harbour full of bustle and
the smell of cooking fish. A shop full of locally crafted woodwork yielded
various gifts, including a dodecahedron for a mathematical relative. And I
found the ideal place to sta
y - the modest little Villa Maroc, built and furnished with charm and greenery
on several floors round a central well in a back street.

INNOVATIONS
THERE have been many mind machines but, so far, most have featured in science
fiction movies. Here's a mind machine for our time. It's a gadget which links
light, sound, and the brain. It's a method for getting away from it all which
costs about the same
as a cancellation to Majorca.
Produced by Lifetools, the Mindlab is promoted as a way of attaining the full
benefits of meditation without any of its tedium. The Mindlab is a compact box
of electronics linked to a set of goggles and stereo headphones.
For up to an hour, the wearer can be tuned into a blend of sound waves and
swirling light pulses of colour. Lifetools says the synchronised patterns slow
down beta-wave patterns in the brain to a state of relaxation, while alpha
waves are boosted to a str
ong focus.
As the spiralling light patterns slow down, the mind is supposed to follow
suit. The equipment can be programmed for different levels and times, with a
rechargeable battery for reaching states of meditation for up to forty years.
It's small enough to use on a plane where the swirling lights are possibly the
equivalent of two gins and an in-flight movie.
The system is also reprogrammable from tapes and the material includes
specially designed sound and light concerts, and multi-sensory hypnotic tapes.
A colour-sync option lets external sounds trigger the light intensity, which
might add a further dimensio
n to Sergeant Pepper if we ever needed one. A sound generator allows the wearer
to pick exactly the right tone to suit any taste.
At #269, one would probably need several sessions to get over the blow to the
wallet, but that's still #80 less than the upmarket PolySync pro version which
is a little more sophisticated and allows the user to specify the frequency of
lights, sound pitch
, and has 50 built-in programmes.
After the hustle and bustle of the festivities, a personal show of light and
sound has its attractions. It might just beat watching re-runs.

n.HOLD everything for a second at the bells on Hogmanay. But only for a second.
That's what will happen to the world's atomic clocks just before the stroke of
midnight marks the border between this year and 1996.
The keepers of the primary standard of time and frequency will be adding a leap
second on December 31. This is the 20th such adjustment to the world's time
scale, as decreed by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris.
Such seconds are ne
eded to keep our clocks - the best of which are now so accurate they lose or
gain less than a millionth of a second per year - in step with the spinning
Earth, which varies several thousandths of a second per day.
Since we can't speed up the Earth, we have to slow down the clocks every one to
two years to keep them ``in synch''. This is done by stopping them for exactly
one second so the Earth can catch up.
This year's leap second will be inserted at 23:59:60 Co-ordinated Universal
Time. That means the official last minute of 1995 will actually be 61 seconds
long. But who's counting? Happy New Year from Frontiers!
n.IF you are considering first footing tomorrow night, it's best to put your
best foot forward...... and make sure you keep your balance, especially if
you're in high heels.
Fortunately, assistance in keeping one's feet may be at hand from a team of
Dundee researchers who've been doing some fancy footwork to save us from the
follies of fashion. It has developed an electronic insole which doesn't take
the weight off one's feet
, but spreads it around to where it's most beneficial.
The team, led by Rami Abboud, a biomedical and rehabilitation engineer, aims to
help patients with problem feet without their having to undergo surgery. The
new insole has a set of transducers which redistributes the weight of a
shoe-wearer to ease pressu
re on delicate joints, thus helping to reduce foot deformities.
n.NEW research shows a recently discovered gene cold be a major factor in what
determines a person's skin type - and be a clue to potential risk of skin
cancer. The melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene is the focus of
research by the Human Genetic
s Unit in Edinburgh and the Department of dermatology at Newcastle.
Skin cancers are on the increase for a number of reasons. Susceptibility varies
and it's long been known fair-skinned people are at risk. Those with dark,
pigmented skin face a vastly reduced threat. According to the researchers, the
ability to tan is rel
ated to the type of pigment produced, either dark eumelanin or red
phaeomelanin. The Mels tan easily but the redskin-palefaces don't have this
protection.
The researchers have been looking at what regulates the relative proportions of
the two pigments and found it's all connected with the MSH receptor gene. The
work, funded by the Medical Research Council, is likely to have serious
implications for not only
the understanding of the tanning response, but, more importantly, in helping
to determine the risk factor associated with skin cancers and skin ageing.
Further research is planned to examine the changes in the MSH receptor gene in
different populations.
n.THE connection between Beethoven's music and heavy metal may soon be
discovered. A team of scientific and anthropological experts from Arizona
Univeristy has bought a small oval frame with a lock of hair reportedly from
Ludwig von Beethoven. The lock wi
ll be compared to other known samples of the composer's hair to help establish
its authenticity, and then tested to determine whether the maestro had heavy
metals, such as lead, arsenic, or mercury in his system.
These could act as clues to his medical condition for traces of such elements
may be the result of medicinal compounds. Urologist Alfredo Guevara bought the
lock of hair a year ago at Sothebys London auction house in conjunction with
Ira F. Brilliant, who
has established a centre for Beethoven Studies in California.
If the investigators manage to determine the locks are genuine, they should be
able to give a picture of his condition and possibly the influences on his life
and work.

ONE of the world's leading teams involved in the investigation of marine
mammals' biology will soon be based in St Andrews. The Natural Environment
research Council's Sea Mammal Research Unit will be flitting from Cambridge to
operate from the Gatty Marin
e Laboratory in February.
It will have the opportunity to study seals in controlled conditions, in a new
40-metre tank in a new extension to the Gatty which will open next year to
coincide with the laboratory's centenary.
The Sea Mammal Research Unit has pioneered the development of satellite-linked
loggers which follow diving behaviour, feeding, and physiology of marine
animals and allow their status and travels to be studied in the open ocean.
Beluga whales in the Arctic, elephant seals in the Antarctic, and grey seals
around Scotland are just some of the sea creatures it has focused on. On the
Isle of May, in the Forth, the team has studied the grey seal population -
their breeding success, su
sceptibility to disease, and levels of pollutants in their bodies.
The SMRU will work closely with the Wildlife Population Assessment research
group in St Andrews University in a bid to estimate the population sizes of
whales, dolphins, and porpoises.
Dr Philip Hammond, who has moved to St Andrews in advance of the team's flit
says: ``The excellent new facilities and the active research environment of the
Gatty will enable the Unit to realise its full potential as a world-class
centre of excellence.''
Over at Stirling Uniersity, the Natural Environment Research Council has
awarded almost #170,000 for a fish reproduction study. The grant has been won
by Professor Niall Bromage and Dr Clive Randall of the Institute of Aquaculture
and will support a study
of the ways in which fish use seasonal patterns of changing day length to time
their reproductive activity.
Professor Bromage says: ``This should have considerable interest to the fish
farming industry, which is worth #400.million a year.''
The results of the research should allow trout and salmon farmers to enable
their fish to produce eggs and milt on demand in any month of the year and not
just for the short autumnal period when the fish begin to breed.
The all-year supply will help the trout and salmon industry to maintain a
continuity of production of market-sized fish of consistent quality throughout
the year, thus avoiding gluts and shortages of current production. It will
probably stabilise prices t
oo.

JANUARY
n THE year opened under the grim shadow of Frederick West as he hanged himself
in Winston Green Prison, Birmingham. He left his wife Rosemary to face 10
murder charges in what would become the ``House of Horrors'' trial.
On the other side of the Atlantic, chief prosecutor Marcia Clark was getting
her hair cut and selecting demure rather than figure-hugging suits to adjust
her image for America's ``Trial of the Century'' as the O J Simpson court soap
opened.
In Britain and America, security and justice were in the dock. The Home
Secretary faced resignation calls as three dangerous inmates gained a copy of a
master key to escape from Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, and tried to take off in a
Cessna aircraft at Sando
wn Airport. News was also coming through of rioting at Everthorpe Prison, North
Humberside.
Eric Cantona leapt a barrier at Selhurst Park and planted a kung-fu kick in the
ribs of a taunting Crystal Palace fan to set the tone for a year of living
dangerously for football. Necrotising fasciitis posed another scary form of
attack, except it couldn
't be suspended for the rest of the season or ordered to carry out community
service.
Neither was it going to be a tranquil time for Royals. The announcement of
divorce proceedings for the Parker Bowles prompted a new spate of Prince
Charles and Camilla revelations. A poll suggested Prince William, and not
Charles, was the popular choice f
or the next king. The Princess of Wales gelled back her hair. Lord Charteris,
the Queen's former private secretary, offered a testimonial for the Duchess of
York: ``She is vulgar, vulgar, vulgar, and that is it''.
A year of 50th anniversaries and somber reflection began with events to mark
the half-centenary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Farewells to
satirist/comedian Peter Cook, conducter Sir Alexander Gibson, writer/naturalist
Gerald Durrell, entertainer Larry
Grayson.
Quote of the Month: ``In the early days, privatisation signalled liberty,
equity, prosperity. Now it's just a bunch of slobs stinging the consumer and
putting each other's salaries up over a heavy lunch.'' (Former Cabinet Minister
Alan Clark).
FEBRUARY
n IT was a strange month. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, Britain had a
man walking in space. ``Golly, it's high, isn't it?'', reported Dr Mike Foale
from the US space shuttle Discovery. Equally long after it could possibly
matter, Leith had a sus
pected ex-KGB agent. ``The only time I could be called an agent was when I was
a collector for Littlewood's Pools,'' responded former Labour MP Ron Brown.
A parrot called Barney was restored to the custody of his owner after
identifying Georgina Morgans in the Crown Court, London, with two affectionate
wolf whistles. A Scottish Industry Minister called Allan Stewart resigned after
a fracas with protesters a
gainst the proposed M77 in which he was alleged to have brandished a pick-axe.
A separate assembly was promised Northern Ireland in the historic UK-Irish
Peace Framework initiative launched in Belfast, but devolution for Scotland
would cost #2845m, according to converted unionist Ian Lang, the Scottish
Secretary. British Gas emphasi
sed his point by declaring profits of #1.25m, or #40 a second. Barings,
Britain's oldest merchant bank, tried to match this in reverse with a collapse
that sent the pound plunging.
Farewells to actor Donald Pleasence, Tory MP/wit/bon viveur Sir Nicholas
Fairbairn, writer/vet James Herriot, and former tennis champion Fred Perry.
Quote of the Month: ``I'm a silly old fool.'' (Stephen Fry, after stage-fright
and bad reviews led him to walk out on his West End show).
MARCH
n NICK LEESON, the missing financial trader involved in the Barings disaster,
was detained by police at Frankfurt Airport. ``I'm the fall guy,'' he said
classically. ``I only blew #200 million.''
It became a month for trading places. Gerry Adams visited New York. The Queen
visited Belfast. Grand Prix star Damon Hill visited the Bicester Magistrates to
face a speeding ban. His time, 102.7mph on the M40 at Adderbury, Oxfordshire,
was reckoned the fa
stest of the year he recorded without bumping into Michael Schumacher.
The Beatles launched a revival, and discovered that All You Need Is John. The
Kray Twins lost Ronnie. But Tom Hanks proved you could continue solo as a
complete dork, when he won his (second successive) Oscar for Forrest Gump.
Football's year of kung-fu, bungs, banged-up stars, and drugs continued with
Hampshire Police detaining Bruce Grobbelaar, John Fashanu, and Hans Seegers for
questioning on match-fixing allegations. Tragedy struck down the incomparable
Davie Cooper, who di
ed at 39 after suffering a subarachnoid haemorrhage of the brain.
Other farewells: journalist/broadcaster Hugh Cochrane, pop star/eccentric Viv
Stanshall, and actor Robert Urquhart.
Quote of the Month: ``And who are you?'' (Joan Rivers interviewing Elizabeth
Hurley at the Oscar Awards ceremony).
APRIL n IT was a month for politicians to shoot themselves in the foot. The
Commons pulled the plug on Tory MPs David Tredinnick and Graham Riddick in the
``cash for questions'' row. The Labour Party pulled the plug on Clause Four, in
its public seduction
of the English middle-class vote. Three Scottish judges pulled the plug on
Panorama's interview with John Major, but it would have taken more than BBC
partiality to save the Tories from being wiped out in the Scottish local
elections. They were left with
out control of a single authority.
There were two ways to hit the National Lottery jackpot. Two people shared a
#22m ``rolled-over'' prize by getting the numbers right. The Churchill family
scored #12.5m by selling state papers to the nation and getting the Lottery to
cough up.
Two atrocities shocked the world. In Rwanda the agony continued with the
slaughter of thousands of Hutu men, women, and children in the Kibeho refugee
camp. At Oklahoma City more than 130 adults and children were killed by the
bombing of a federal governm
ent building. Neo-Nazi Timothy McVeigh was arrested as President Clinton
promised the death penalty for the cuprits.
Farewells to friend of the arts George Singleton (Mr Cosmo), DJ/comedian Kenny
Everett, singer/actor Burl Ives, and film star Ginger Rogers.
Quote of the Month: ``When seagulls follow a trawler, it is because they think
sardines will be thrown into the sea.'' (Eric Cantona, on receiving 120 hours'
community service order).
MAY
n IT was an unhappy time for Scottish domestic productions. Actor Tom McGovern
protested over the withdrawal of the film role of Robert Bruce after seeing Rob
Roy go to Liam Neeson, William Wallace go to Mel           Gibson, and the Loch
Ness Monster go
to Ted Danson.
We weren't even allowed to make and enjoy our own cheese. A ton of Lanark Blue
was seized by environmental health officers as a listeria monocytogenes claim
grated on.
The only victory was for the Fort William sleeper service. The Court of Session
found against ScotRail, who had tried to derail statutory consultation by
calling one-way empty trains a ``passenger service''. This confirmed that for
years ScotRail services
had little to do with passengers, and it prompted a great rail debate.
Inspired, perhaps, by VE-Day anniversary celebrations, Nato committed to air
strike action against Bosnian-Serbs. In a tragic escalation, 71 were killed in
retaliatory shelling of Tuzla and 350 UN peace-keepers (including 33 Britons)
were taken hostage as
``human shields''.
Farewells to former prime minister Lord (Harold) Wilson, fashion designer Jean
Muir, and Bet Gilroy (who announced she was pulling her last pint in Coronation
Street).
Quote of the Month: ``If I had been a surgeon I would have been a super
surgeon. If I had been an architect I would have been a super architect. If I
had been Frank Sinatra I wouldn't have made much of a living.'' (Bosnian-Serb
General Ratko Mladic).
JUNE
n IT became official that rats outnumbered people in the United Kingdom. The
estimate was of a 30% population increase to bring the tail count of Rattus
Norvegicus to 60 million. ``Rats are reliable,'' commented Rob Ollason, head of
the education section
of Edinburgh Zoo. ``I've never known one to bite a member of the public.''
John Major offered to make way for one by resigning the Tory leadership and
opening it to election. ``It is time to put up or shut up,'' he challenged.
Welsh secretary John Redwood, a Thatcherite hard-liner, duly obliged. His
resignation from the Cabinet
was celebrated in the valleys. ``He will go down like a rat sandwich,''
predicted Ieuan Wyn Jones, Plaid Cymru whip, accurately.
Hugh Grant tried to play rat to revise a thoroughly boring image as Mr Squeaky
Clean by consulting Ms Divine Brown in a BMW convertible on Sunset Boulevard.
An act of lewd conduct was the police interpretation. Publicity for Grant's
forthcoming film, Nine
Months, was guaranteed and his girlfriend Liz Hurley didn't have to tell
anyone who she was any more.
Mike Tyson wanted it known that if he wasn't a new rat, at least he had a new
name. It was as Abdul Malik Aziz that he emerged from prison after three years
for a rape conviction, and he was a more commercial proposition than ever.
Curiously, it was as Mi
ke Tyson that he climbed back into the ring.
Farewells to film critic Dilys Powell and film star Lana Turner.
Quote of the Month: ``It doesn't matter who you are, I would ticket my own
father or even my husband.'' (Traffic warden Angela Hallam, receiving police
award for 4071 parking tickets issued in a year).
JULY
n MICHAEL FORSYTH was appointed Scottish Secretary in the cabinet reshuffle
after John Major's sweeping ballot victory in the Tory leadership fight. Ian
Lang went to Trade Secretary. ``It's Reservoir Dogs II,'' commented a senior
Scottish Conservative.
Gazza arrived. Gazza endorsements, Gazza haircuts, Gazza mania. He was not the
only manifestion of ``weather rage'' in one of the hottest Julys on record.
Average temperatures for Glasgow were 16.3 C, about 1.6 degrees hotter than
normal. William Hills dr
opped the odds to 10-1 for temperatures topping 100F on the British mainland.
France, which had gone belatedly bellicose since VE-Day, suspended nuclear
tests on Muroroa Atoll temporarily to storm the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior
II in the South Pacific - a rare naval triumph.
The release of Private Lee Clegg was met with rioting in Belfast. Arsenal
manager George Graham was found guilty of misconduct and banned by the Football
Association.
Farewells to DJ Wolfman Jack, former motor racing champion Juan Manuel Fangio,
poet Sir Stephen Spender, and country singer Charlie Rich.
Quote of the Month: ``You don't negotiate with prime ministers. There isn't a
deal.'' (Michael Heseltine, rewarded with the new post of deputy prime minister
after supporting Major in the leadership election).
AUGUST n FOR the anniversaries of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagaskai,
and VJ-Day, Japanese prime minister Murayama expressed ``profound remorse'' for
his nation's wartime atrocities. This sparked a row. Was it an apology? Was he
speaking only fo
r himself? Veterans said it wasn't enough.
An epidemic of wasps (of the yellow and black variety) was the latest product
of the long hot summer, the driest since records began in 1659. ``I've been
chased up the Royal Mile wearing a floral tie,'' boasted Edinburgh
environmental health director Rich
ard Carson. This became an occupational hazard in an Edinburgh Festival in
which bottoms were an official theme with the arrival of Canova's Three Graces.
Croatia launched an all-out offensive in Krajina, capturing Knin as the
fighting spread into Bosnia, as the Serbs accused each other of treachery.
Sarajevo market was mortar-shelled by Bosnian-Serbs, killing 37, injuring 85.
Serb-held positions were bombe
d by Nato jets, as the misery turned another circle.
Old Labour accused Tony Blair's New Labour of abandoning grassroots, as union
sponsorship of MPs was abandoned, and a battle for the soul of the party
ensued. ``It is not our responsibility to be lobotomised foot soldiers for the
New Blair Army,'' said Hi
llhead MP George Galloway.
Farewells to film star Ida Lupino, writer/campaigner Bridget Brophy,
mountaineer Alison Hargreaves and amateur rugby.
Quote of the Month: ``How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to
get them past the test?'' (Duke of Edinburgh, talking to driving instructor
Robert Drummond during a visit to Oban).
SEPTEMBER n IT was a month for posing. The island of Skye claimed to be part of
the British mainland (despite the misgivings of a Bradford firm later in the
year who would charge Euro postage rates), but it was announced it would cost
#5.20 for a passenge
r car to demonstrate it.
Posing as a 32-year-old, Liz Taylor announced that her eighth marriage, to
construction worker Larry Fortensky, 20 years her junior, was on the rocks.
Posing as 17-year-old Brandon Lee, the 32-year-old star of the Bearsden Academy
production of South Paci
fic was revealed as none other than Brian MacKinnon. Posing as pupil William
Windsor, Charles and Diana's eldest son began humble school-days at Eton
College. Posing as a pair of adults, Will and Julia Carling announced that they
would need time and space
alone.
Bosnian Serbs were withdrawing from Sarajevo and driven to a peace deal
brokered by President Clinton in Geneva. France's continuation of nuclear
testing in the South Pacific was internationally condemned, and protest riots
brought the Tahitian capital to
flames.
Farewell to poet Donald Davie, Labour Party treasurer Sam McCluskey, and
actress Susan Fleetwood.
Quote Of The Month: ``Cash is vulgar.'' (Naomi Campbell on why she carries only
plastic for those rare occasions when she actually has to pay for anything).
OCTOBER
n TRAGEDY in the ring. James Murray died of brain injuries after his British
title bout in Glasgow with Drew Docherty. Renewed calls for a ban on the sport
were met by brave words from the dead boxer's father, who said the fight must
continue.
After an interminable nine-month trial, 120 witnesses, 45,000 pages of
transcript and 1100 exhibits, O J Simpson got the not guilty verdict that had
begun to appear as an inevitable guilty verdict when he was arrested 16 months
before. the Rosemary West t
rial began.
Derek Lewis, head of the prison service, was given the finger after a damning
inquiry into the Parkhurst breakout, but tried to stay at the wicket. Duncan
Ferguson's appeal against jail failed. The Faldos marriage broke, Michael
Howarth divorced the Tory
Party, but Canada and Quebec stayed hitched, just. Boris Yeltsin survived a
second heart scare, and a political power struggle. Cliff Richard received a
knighthood for pop survival.
Farewell to former prime minister Lord (Douglas) Home of the Hirsel, writer
Kingsley Amis, astrologer Patrick Walker and legendary Grand national winner
Red Rum.
Quote Of The Month: ``This prosecution team did not lose today. I deeply
believe that this country lost today.'' (Fred Goldman, father of one of the two
victims, on the O J Simpson verdict).
NOVEMBER
n TWO political murders. Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated
by a right-wing Jewish extremist while leaving a rally in Tel Aviv. His role in
the Middle East peace process had earned him the name of ``traitor'', but he
refused to wear a b
ullet-proof vest. In Nigeria, international pressure was ignored with the
execution of dissident writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others following a farce
of a trial. John Major called it judicial murder. The Commonwealth conference
took the unprecedented s
tep of suspending Nigeria.
Rosemary West was jailed for life 10 times over, after her husband gave taped
evidence from the grave, and admitted burying 20 more victims. The Barclay
Brothers bought The Scotsman. The Princess of Wales shocked the Palace with her
Dianorama confessions.
Newsreader Julia Sommerville and her boyfriend were questioned by police after
a roll of film containing exposures of her seven-year-old daughter posing in
the bath with shaving foam was reported. Police said no action would be taken.
The Queen Mother, a
ged 92, had hip replacement surgery. Pat Barker won the Booker Prize with The
Ghost Road. Rangers and Celtic were humbled in European competition with 4-goal
and 3-goal defeats on consecutive nights against Juventus and Paris St Germain.
Farewell to comedian Marti Caine, actor Paul Eddington, soul musician Junior
Walker, film director Louis Malle, DJ Stuart Henry and Today newspaper.
Quote of the Month: ``It's left us with a huge hole to fill.'' (Arsenal Ladies'
soccer coach Vik Akers on the news the star striker was out for the rest of the
season because she was pregnant).
DECEMBER
n MAD cow disease paranoia catching. Schools across Britain took beef dishes
off the dinners' menu. The Duchess of York sent a #250,000 diamond necklace and
bracelet, a wedding present from her mother-in-law, through baggage at Kennedy
Airport, New York.
Astonishingly, they went missing. Even more astonishingly, they were recovered.
Also in New York, the Princess of Wales won an award for humanitarian work.
Former secretary of state, Dr Henry Kissinger, declared her ``luminous''
personality was a benefit to the world. HM Government said it was okay to

LABOUR leader Tony Blair plans a series of nationwide meetings with members of
the public during 1996 - a year in which, he said yesterday, Labour would try
to bring down the Government before Parliament runs its full span.
Mr Blair has developed a taste for ``meet the people '' gatherings following
the successful ones he conducted first with party members during the Clause
Four debate and then with different sections of the business community.
Now he plans that he and his shadow Cabinet colleagues will speak at a series
of public meetings open to voters who are not Labour supporters. In his New
Year message, he said he believed Labour had now built up a relationship of
trust with the people. Ne
xt year he wants to move beyond that ``to form a genuine partnership with the
people''.
Mr Blair said: ``I do not want the public to elect a Labour Government simply
because they despise the Conservatives for what they have done to the country.
I want them to elect a Labour Government because they know us and understand
our policies and they
believe these policies can make them better off in a better Britain.''
He added: ``If we can get an early election, we will be delighted and we will
be prepared for it. We believe essentially that the Government has lost all
purpose and direction. There is no vision and no leadership.''
He said Labour had the opportunity to rise to the challenge of providing that
leadership, giving a sense of direction, and justifying the hope people had
placed in them.
Despite his party's huge opinion poll lead, running at more than 30%, Mr Blair
said complacency remained ``a constant enemy'' and the party must be
``determined and disciplined''.
Recognising cynicism among the electorate as a second enemy, he said: ``We must
restore faith in politics by being honest with the people and by making only
those promises we know can be kept.''
The travelling campaign to sell this message to the voters would enable people
to test him and his team.
Britain had declined as an economic power and been marginalised in Europe where
the Government's decisions were taken not in the national interest but ``to
hold together a fundamentally divided party''.

<HEADLINE>Coach ban for outside lane</HEADLINE>

COACHES and larger mini-buses will be banned from the outside lane of motorways
for a two-year trial period, the Scottish Office announced yesterday.
The new legislation was immediately condemned by National Express spokesman
Stuart Render as ``a knee-jerk reaction to a number of accidents not at all
related to the third lane or to speeding coaches.''
The ban comes into effect on January 1, in response to an EC directive that
will permanently limit coach speeds to 65mph, which operators say will increase
the Aberdeen-London travelling time by half an hour.
Mr Andrew Howard, head of road safety for the Automobile Association, said the
new legislation would prove whether imposing further restrictions on coaches
would improve road safety.
RAC spokeswoman Ms Sue Nicholson said the organisation was concerned that
coaches fitted with the new limiters would cause ``bunching'' on motorways.
The spokeswoman also called for more training for drivers, pointing out that
``the most effective speed limiter is the driver's right foot''.
No comment was available from either the Department of Transport or the
Scottish Office.

SCOTTISH political leaders are squaring up for a General Election battle in
1996.
New Year messages from the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party, and the
Liberal Democrats set the scene for a political dogfight next year.
Scottish Conservative chairman, Sir Michael Hirst, in his message to party
members, recognised that a General Election could soon be called.
He said the party was preparing for a contest but could only offer a ``good
fighting chance of securing a fifth term of Government''. In a New Year message
last year, Prime Minister John Major was more positive. He said the party was
``invincible'' if it
was united.
Sir Michael admitted the party, which has suffered electoral defeats and a
continued decline in popularity, had ``weathered quite a storm'' during 1995.
However, he added that the ``listening party'' was in a positive and buoyant
mood.
He said: ``Scottish Tories have plenty of spine and I believe we have rallied
and the fightback is well under way. We have started to turn the tide and we
are now setting the political agenda for Scotland.''
He said the appointment of Michael Forsyth as Scottish Secretary had un-nerved
political opponents.
He repeated claims that tax cuts would be introduced when prudent and launched
a bitter attack on Labour's devolution plans. He accused the Liberal Democrats
of slavishly supporting ``ill-conceived and dangerous'' plans for
constitutional change.
Sir Michael added that the party guns would be trained on the SNP.
He concluded: ``There is no doubt that much effort and hard work is still
needed to reassure many of our supporters. It would be foolish and naive to
suggest otherwise.
``But I am confident that many of our long-term policies to secure Britain's
ever-improving economy will afford us the opportunity of more tax cuts.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond put his party on full election alert and said the
Tories were ``running out of political rope at Westminster and face the
prospect of being run out of office''.
In a reference to the Mel Gibson blockbuster, he said 1996 was the year for
``brave hearts and wise heads'' in Scotland.
Despite a recent downturn in SNP support following a summer high, Mr Salmond
added that Scotland could dictate the political agenda over the next 12 months.
He said Conservative leaders had effectively admitted that the status quo was
not working in Scotland.
He repeated claims in last year's message that Labour was a ``Mark.II Tory
party'' scrambling for votes in Middle England at the expense of Scots.
Mr Salmond said: ``This is the time for brave hearts and wise heads in Scotland
- brave hearts to power through Tory scaremongering and secure the best future
for Scotland, and wise heads to see through Labour's pretence of promoting
Scottish interests.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said success in the local
government elections north of the Border, which saw the party win 123 seats,
provided a solid base on which to build. He also claimed his party would set
the political agenda and added
that they were the only true guarantors of a Scottish parliament.
He further pledged support for a Scottish Office anti-drugs initiative.
Mr Wallace said the Liberal Democrats aimed to become the second largest party
in Scotland after the General Election.
He said: ``We shall go forward committed to the effort needed for a major
electoral battle but in the sure knowledge that our message will find a
receptive audience.''
q.Meanwhile, the Scottish Tourist Board (STB) in its 1996 message revealed a
#5m project to link the network of computers in STB offices around Scotland,
which serve some nine million visitors.

FIVE people were injured, three seriously, in a Highland hotel at lunchtime
yesterday when part of the building's heating system, a back boiler behind an
open fire in the lounge bar, exploded.
Temperatures in Newtonmore village, in the Badenoch area, had been around -20C
and there had been a 14-hour power cut in the previous days, leading many to
speculate that frozen pipes were at fault.
The explosion rocked the lounge bar of Braeriach Hotel on Main Street. One of
the most seriously injured was the hotel owners' son, Mr Duncan Harper, 27, who
had been tending bar at the time.
The force of the blast sent furniture and fittings flying across the room, some
of which were thought to have caught Mr Harper in the face, knocking him
unconscious. He was flown by air ambulance helicopter to Raigmore Hospital,
Inverness, where he remain
ed under observation in the intensive therapy unit last night. His condition is
stable and comfortable.
The helicopter then flew back to link up with a road ambulance that earlier had
picked up an elderly couple, the only customers in the lounge bar at the time
of the explosion. They were airlifted to Raigmore but no information was
available on their condi
tion last night.
The hotel has been owned by Mr John Harper and his wife Anne for the past 12
years. Mrs Harper was one of the other people slightly hurt when glass from the
bar was sent flying in to the street.
A fire service spokesman said a frozen water inlet or outlet pipe had almost
certainly caused the blast.

SCOTLAND'S local authorities remained unimpressed yesterday with Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth's latest bid to decentralise power from Government to
councils.
Publishing his consultation paper, Devolution of Power to Councils, Mr Forsyth
said he would be seeking views over the next three months on the scrapping of a
range of regulatory burdens hanging round the necks of local authorities.
The proposals in the consultation paper are designed to give councils more
freedom and include powers to councils to draw up their own by-laws and limited
powers over traffic regulations.
However, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities said that while Mr
Forsyth claimed to be pro local government, the proposals revealed a different
story. The organisation accused Mr Forsyth of refusing to give an inch on key
issues which would give c
ouncils more democratic accountability.
Cosla submitted a list of 52 proposals in November. Later in the month, Mr
Forsyth announced a wide-ranging review of all Scottish Office controls over
local government and trailed many of the proposals announced yesterday.
Crucially, he rejected nine of
Cosla's key proposals.
The convention's president, Ms Rosemary McKenna, pointed out that, from April,
councils would have to use a quarter of capital receipts to repay debts and in
the following years half the total of cash raised.
``In reality, councils will have very little cash left. The Scottish Secretary
is just tinkering. If Cosla's discussions with the Scottish Office on
relaxation of controls of local government are to have any credibility, then
the issue of general competen
ce must be on the table.''

SCOTLAND gains six new knights in today's New Year's honours list, which also
features awards for show-business and sporting celebrities and a number of
previously unsung heroes.
The retiring chief constable of Strathclyde Police, Mr Leslie Sharp, receives a
knighthood, as do Professor David Carter, chairman of the Scottish Liver
Transplantation Unit, and the principal of Glasgow University, Professor Graeme
Davies.
They are joined by Professor Donald Mackay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise; Dr
Kenneth Calman, the Government's chief medical officer; and leading Scottish
Tory, Mr Adrian Shinwell.
One of the saddest entries on the list is the CBE for Mr Archie Gillespie,
Strathclyde region's director of finance, who collapsed and died at his home on
Christmas Day.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman yesterday confirmed that the medal would be
presented to Mr Gillespie's widow, Alice, although official protocol meant the
ceremony would not involve an investiture at Buckingham Palace.
Scottish golfer Bernard Gallacher, who captained this year's European Ryder Cup
team to victory over the US, receives an OBE.
In total, 1036 people are honoured, with 40% of all awards recommended by
members of the public.
One third of those honoured are women, including Stella Rimington, head of
Britain's security services, who becomes a dame, and agony aunt Claire Rayner,
who gets an OBE.
The list contains stars from the pop scene, TV, and the stage. Actress Julie
Goodyear, the former Coronation Street landlady Bet Gilroy, is made an MBE,
while Elton John becomes a CBE. Cameron Mackintosh, the successful stage
impresario, becomes a knight,
while actress Peggy Mount, 78, gets an OBE.
In the world of politics, an unexpected knighthood goes to Tory back-bencher
Michael Spicer (South Worcestershire), one of the ringleaders of the back-bench
rebellion against the Maastricht legislation.
Last week, the former Minister contributed to the Government's humiliating
defeat over Euro-fisheries by arriving too late to vote.
Labour's deputy shadow Scottish Secretary John McFall last night attacked the
award of a knighthood to Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish
Enterprise. He said he could only presume that Professor MacKay had been
honoured for political services.
Another row concerned the knighthood given to furniture tycoon Graham Kirkham,
who is reported to have bailed out the Tory Party with a #4m loan.
Labour's deputy leader John Prescott called it ``the crudest example yet of
honours being given for financial services to the Conservative Party''.

A WIDOWED mother who took a night porter's job in a hotel to provide for her
three infant children is rewarded for her devotion with an MBE in the list.
Mrs Jean McGlashan, 54, has done the night shift at the Buchanan Arms Hotel at
Drymen for 20 years following the death of her first husband.
She only took the job because she was allowed to bring her three young children
to the hotel with her while she worked throughout the night.
Mrs McGlashan, now head night porter at the hotel, said: ``I am absolutely
thrilled. The award is for everyone at the hotel, not just myself, because they
have all been so kind to me.''
Her first husband, Alistair, died 20 years ago, leaving her to bring up sons
Stuart and Alan, and daughter Gail, on her own.
Mrs McGlashan, who married second husband Donald 10 years ago, said the job
still was great fun, despite having to work from 10pm to 8am five nights a week.
She said: ``The hotel is really my life. I love it, and you meet a lot of nice
people who become friends, not just guests.''

ISLAND blacksmith John Corsie, 75 and still working full-time in the Orkney
islands, said yesterday he ``hadn't a clue'' who had nominated him for an
honour.
``I wasn't sure whether it was a hoax or not,'' said Mr Carsie, who started
work in his father's forge at Orphir, Orkney, at the age of 14. ``But who would
not be pleased to get an honour like that. I certainly am.''

ANGRY islanders called a town hall meeting yesterday in protest at the closure
of a beach for ``goodwill'' ambassador, the Princess of Wales.
The beach was closed by police and Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force officers
protecting the princess's privacy.
Islanders also claim they feel slighted because she refused an invitation to
present awards at a ceremony yesterday for people who helped the island recover
from Hurricane Luis, which hit in September.
``Our beaches are open, we're free to do what we want on them, so we're not at
all happy about this,'' said one resident.
The princess is taking her holiday in the Caribbean while princes William, 13,
and Harry, 11, Christmas with Prince Charles.
She is staying at a guest house in Codrington, where most of the island's 1500
residents live. The village is about 10 miles from the K-Club, an exclusive
private resort whose beach was screened off for her visit - even though all
beaches in Barbuda are p
ublic.
``Legally, we can access the beach and sit next to her. Legally, it's not the
K-Club's or Diana's, and we totally object to anybody trying to shut off what
is public property,'' said Ms Francilla Francis, former chairwoman of the
Barbuda Council, the isla
nd's local ruling body.
q.The Royal Family was derided as ``po-faced'' yesterday over an advert
featuring the Princess of Wales kissing footballer Paul Gascoigne.
Palace officials in the Lord Chamberlain's Office complained at the use of the
princess to promote a L!ve TV programme and demanded immediate steps to ensure
the adapted picture was not used again.
L!ve TV supremo and former Sun editor, Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, replied in a letter
saying: ``If the House of Windsor wishes to survive into the twenty-first
century, they will have to lighten up. Being so po-faced hasn't done them much
good lately.''
He added: ``I have no intention of withdrawing the advert.''

DETECTIVES investigating the attempted murder of a woman who ran an escort
agency from her home appealed yesterday for information about a man seen
running across back gardens and discarding clothing.
Mrs Ann Fidler, 43, was given a 50-50 chance of survival, 48 hours after being
viciously beaten in her house at Eastleigh, Hampshire.
She advertised her escort business in a local newspaper using the names Alex
and Lisa - and police appealed for her clients to come forward, saying
information they provide will be treated with sensitivity and in confidence.
Detectives, who have been unable to speak to Mrs Fidler because of her
condition, say they cannot be certain the attack had anything to do with the
agency.
They also appealed for members of a gymnasium which she and her husband Brett
run to come forward.
Detective Superintendent John Harvey said: ``We are looking for a motive in
this case. Because of that, the inquiry is wide open.''
Mrs Fidler was found in her heavily blood-stained kitchen by her husband when
he returned from work at the nearby gymnasium on Wednesday evening.
There were no signs of a break-in at the Southampton Road house.
Det Supt Harvey said bloodstains were found in other rooms of the
three-bedroomed, end-of-terrace building.
He said there did not appear to be a sexual motive for the attack.
Mr Harvey said members of Mrs Fidler's family were ``totally unaware'' of her
escort business but declined to say whether that included her husband.
The couple have been married for about seven years and have no children.
Mr Fidler and his wife's parents were at her bedside yesterday in Southampton
General Hospital, where she has undergone several emergency operations.
``She is in a very poorly state and the doctors have given her a 50-50
chance,'' said Mr Harvey.
Police centred the hunt for her attacker on a man, described as up to 6ft tall
and with a muscular build, seen running through garden areas between
Southampton Road and Market Street on Wednesday afternoon.
He vaulted a gate and, despite the freezing conditions, was seen to take his
coat off. Police are ``extremely anxious'' to find the man.
They believe it possible his clothing was bloodstained and asked local
residents to check their dustbins for discarded clothing.
Mr Harvey said the man ``may have been involved in some other nefarious
activity''.
The man is said to be aged 30-40 with collar-length, medium brown hair and was
wearing a nylon-type dark grey hip-length jacket and a grey jumper.
Detectives are also checking reports from a neighbour that a man may have been
``casing'' Mrs Fidler's house on Boxing Day, when a car was seen crawling along
the kerb.
Mr and Mrs Fidler were both involved in running the gym but there was no
suggestion it was connected with the escort agency, they said.
Mr Harvey said police were investigating her involvement with the agency. ``We
don't know if she is a woman working by herself or within a group.''
It was not known how many people use the business and correspondence at her
home was being examined to see what contacts she had.
``Because Mrs Fidler is a healthy, fit woman, I think that enabled her to
survive. We are concerned an individual like this, who has made one attack,
could attack someone else.''

<HEADLINE>Major's majority cut to three Tory MP defects to Lib Dems MP's defection a severe blow to Government</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH BUIE and STUART TROTTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
EMMA NICHOLSON, a former Tory Party vice-chairman and MP for the past eight
years, is defecting to the Liberal Democrats.
Her decision cuts Mr Major's overall majority from five to three. But he could
soon lose even that slim margin after two outstanding by-elections are held
early in the New Year.
In a statement last night Miss Nicholson accused the Government of ``indecision
and weak leadership on Europe'' and said Britain was ``neglected by a
Government which does not care''.
A long-time campaigner for human rights, in particular for the disabled and the
Marsh Arabs in Iraq, the 54-year-old MP said the Government had shifted too far
to the right and no longer represented the One-Nation party she had joined.
She predicted that the Government was likely to call an early General Election
but denied that her actions were designed to force its hand. A number of
back-benchers and some Ministers shared her feelings about the shift to the
right, she said.
``I can no longer say that the Tory Party is a One-Nation party,'' she said,
citing apparent attempts by the Government to split the people of Britain, in
particularly through policies on single parents and asylum seekers.
``I cannot go on with that,'' she said. ``I will cast my vote from the Liberal
Democrat benches.''
Miss Nicholson said she would not be standing as a Liberal Democrat candidate
in her constituency of Devon West and Torridge in the next General Election,
but would be offering her support to the Liberal Democratic Party's candidate.
In due time, she said she hoped to stand for the Liberal Democrats for Europe.
Ironically, Mr Tony Blair, the Leader of the Opposition, in a New Year message
released earlier, said it was difficult to see how a Government in such
disarray could ``stumble on''.
With Labour almost certain to win the outstanding Tory seat of Staffordshire
South East, whose MP died earlier this month, and equally certain to hold its
own safe seat of Hemsworth in Yorkshire in February or March at the latest, the
Government majority
will disappear.
The Prime Minister will be even more at the mercy of Tory rebels and even
though the Conservatives are more than 30 points behind Labour in opinion polls
he may decide to go to the country in the spring rather than struggle on.
Miss Nicholson - who, with a majority of 3614, looked likely to lose to her new
party at the next election - is a popular figure in the Commons and comes from
a long line of politically active Conservatives.
She follows Mr Alan Howarth, MP for Stratford-on-Avon, who crossed the floor of
the Commons to join Labour in October just before the opening of the
Conservative Party conference.
Michael Heseltine last night suggested Miss Nicholson had quit the Tory Party
out of frustration at not being made a junior Minister.
The Deputy Prime Minister said she had been to see him twice in the Commons in
recent months expressing a desire to be promoted - but he had not been able to
give her any assurances.
He said she had made ``no threat of any sort'' to him about joining the Liberal
Democrats.
The defection also appeared
Continued from page 1
to have taken Miss Nicholson's constituency by surprise.
Mrs Elizabeth Hampton, chairman of the local Conservative Association in
Okehampton, Devon, said last night: ``Thank you very much for telling me.
Because I did not have the news on, I did not know a thing about it.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said of the defection: ``This is a
dramatic blow to the Tories and a very brave decision indeed. The Government is
now on its last legs.
``She is a recognisable grande dame of the Tory Party. When somebody as central
and as well known as Emma Nicholson finds she is no longer comfortable in their
ranks it shows how far things have gone.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ``This is devastating for the Tories. Emma
Nicholson is not a figure like Alan Howarth who can be dismissed for the
erratic path he has pursued through politics. She has always been a consistent
left-wing Tory and it looks as
if that wing has now dropped off. Being a Tory and having a social conscience
have now clearly become incompatible.''
Speaking from her Westminster home last night, Miss Nicholson spoke of her
concern at the party's ``rightward shift''.
She also admitted that she was ashamed of some of the legislation she had voted
for.
Smiling and looking relaxed, she said: ``It's impossible to pull apart a leader
and a party - they are indivisible.  I find it difficult to see a situation
where a party and a leader are not one thing.''
Asked whether she was angry at being forced out by the rightward shift of the
party, she replied: ``No, I'm not angry. However, I am deeply concerned that
the present Conservative Party's ignorance on so many everyday things - young
people's needs, teenag
ers, parents and education, the poor, the elderly, and asylum seekers.
``The Conservative Party I knew was in touch with all those people and kept
their finger on the pulse of the feelings of the people and responded to them.
``It was not a party that put a wall between itself and people of different
economic and ethnic backgrounds.
``The party changed in the mid-eighties when making money fast became the thing
to do. It seemed to be only the quantity of money and not the ethics of the way
you made it that mattered. I've allowed myself to vote for legislation which I
am ashamed of.
``The Liberal Democrat philosophy seems so close to my own. It's a comfortable,
sensible attitude to Britain's problems.
``My principles aren't wanted. The Conservative party deserves to lose people
like me. There are lots of people in the party who feel the same way as I do.''

WITH Emma Nicholson's decision to leave the Conservative Party, Mr Major's
prospects of hanging on to power until the last possible moment of April or
May, 1997, now look dim.
By March at the latest the two outstanding by-elections should result in his
overall Commons majority disappearing.
He will then be at the not-so-tender mercies of any small group of Conservative
rebels.
It is doubtful if another threat of a confidence vote, followed by a General
Election if he loses, will deter them again as it did when he came to the brink
of losing the Maastricht Treaty Bill.
Most Conservative MPs in marginal seats are convinced they will not be coming
back whenever the election is held and for those with still-safe seats, the
threat may have lost its potency.
There is, in the Tory ranks, a widespread feeling that not only can the
Government not be saved, it may not be worth saving.
Mr Clarke's cautious approach last month exploded the final dreams of some that
a striking Budget might put them back on course for recovery.
The Government has attempted more relaunches than the combined American and
Russian space programmes and none has managed to get the party off the ground
or its opinion-poll ratings off the floor.
Miss Nicholson's departing words are all the more wounding because they come
from someone whose family background is stuffed with political Tories, two of
them Cabinet Ministers.
Very much a ``One Nation'' Tory, her judgment that the Government ``does not
care'' will wound as well as anger Mr Major especially as, though
independent-minded, she was a loyalist who forebore to criticise publicly.
Equally, her judgment that the Government, and she probably means the Prime
Minister especially, has been weak on Europe indicates that Mr Major's attempt
to fence-sit on the issue no longer carries conviction even in his own ranks,
although it is difficu
lt to see what else he can do.
She is not the only pro-European who believes he has been forced to sell-out to
the Euro-sceptics and she may not be the last to abandon his party. Others were
rumoured to be considering defection at the time Mr Alan Howarth crossed the
floor to Labour la
st October.
The divisions on Europe are slowly tearing the Conservative Party apart as
those on Ireland did the Liberals last century. Nor is it a sordid squabble.
The stakes could hardly be higher for the future of Britain.
Both Tory camps are probably unfair to the Prime Minister. Miss Nicholson in
her exasperation has made too little of Mr Major's stubborn refusal to rule out
Britain joining a single currency, which has in turn exasperated the sceptics.
With several economic indicators like inflation, interest rates and even,
relatively, unemployment performing in a way that would have been regarded as a
triumph for earlier prime ministers, Mr Major's unlucky Government is reaping
no reward while being c
onstantly buffeted by policy or personal mishaps which lend conviction to
Opposition claims that this is a dying administration.
Mr Major is famously stubborn and may still try to struggle or, in Mr Blair's
word, ``stumble'' on. He will be increasingly dependent on the nine Ulster
Unionists.
They are highly suspicious of the Northern Ireland peace settlement which they
cannot see having an outcome agreeable to them but they are highly suspicious
of a Labour Government as well.
They are, however, unlikely to demand a price for their support which would
clearly sink the ``peace process'' for, like Sinn Fein and all the Province's
political groups, they do not want to be fingered as the ones who brought the
gun and the bomb back o
n to the streets.
But Mr Major's options look increasingly restricted. There are Tory MPs unhappy
about parts of the Asylum and Immigration Bill, others about the impending
divorce legislation. The Government could find its two main Bills receiving
unwelcome amendment in t
he early part of next year. It could also face losing snap votes on a variety
of issues - one of them Europe.
Three or four months of that might convince even Mr Major that a Government
which is almost impotent in the Commons has no moral right to continue.

<HEADLINE>Nationalists target Labour's man as the Tory `tartan tax' campaign hits home Robertson faces SNP onslaught</HEADLINE>

THE political battle in Scotland will intensify in the New Year with the
decision by the SNP to launch a highly personalised onslaught on Shadow Scots
Secretary George Robertson.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell has written to all the party's senior
office bearers describing Mr Robertson as ``the weak link in Labour's profile
in Scotland'' and seeking lines of attack in their different portfolios to step
up the pressure on him.
The memo also concedes that Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is ``hitting
home'' with his tartan tax offensive and claims that, because Labour under Mr
Robertson is failing to mount a robust defence, the ``myth of the subsidised
Scot'' is spilling over
and hurting the SNP.
To combat this, SNP leader Alex Salmond will seek opportunities for
head-to-head confrontations with Mr Forsyth on economic issues over the next
three months.
However, the most striking features of the communication is its focus on Mr
Robertson, who is described as ``weak'' and is said to have had to be rescued
over the tartan tax issue by Labour leader Tony Blair during his recent visit
to Scotland.
Mr Robertson said last night that he regarded such an attack as a compliment
and said it was to be expected, given Labour strength at present.
``They have a serious problem at the moment and, whenever the nationalists are
desperate, they turn personal. I am neither surprised nor worried. Labour
support has held up consistently.
``The SNP tried the same tactics before the unitary elections and were
trounced. They seem to be obsessed with me at present but it is a wee bit
pathetic for a party that aspires to take Scotland out of the Union to indulge
in this.''
The memo claims that Mr Robertson's alleged weakness was ``emphasised for the
whole of Scotland by the fact that Blair had to rescue him from Forsyth during
Blair's last visit.''
Mr Russell's memo claims there has been internal Labour discussion of ``Mr
Robertson's weak performance, lack of cutting edge, and recourse to bluster
under pressure - which, according to our private information, is shared across
the parties and even with
in `New' Labour in Scotland and at Westminster, where Helen Liddell is being
talked up as a successor''.
He calls on members of the party's Scottish cabinet to come up with issues on
which implications of the Scottish Constitutional Convention's scheme have not
been seriously or correctly considered, adding: ``During the first part of
1996, we intend to put
Robertson under increased pressure.''
The SNP chief executive concedes on the Government's tartan tax offensive:
``There is no doubt that Forsyth is hitting home on Labour with this.
``Some of the attacks, however, are probably spilling over on to us, partly
because Robertson is failing to deflect anything back on the Tories and
allowing the general myth of the `subsidised Scot' to prevail, against all the
real evidence.''
The SNP, he argues, must take the economic case directly to the Tories because
the convention's plans - described as ``the assembly proposals'' - are said to
be hedged about by fears of a backlash from the south of England.
The memo seeks ideas and details for use as ammunition for Mr Salmond in
seeking direct debates with Mr Forsyth on economic issues ``in whatever forums
are available''.
``Forsyth's case is weak,'' claims Mr Russell, ``and is only getting currency
because Labour's plans are weaker still.''
Mr Russell, speaking from his home in Cowal, Strathclyde, said last night:
``One of the things I am trying to do is help the party consider strategy as we
enter the New Year, but I am not going to comment further on what is an
internal party document.''

<HEADLINE>Ten shoppers stabbed in busy supermarket</HEADLINE>

TEN people were injured yesterday when a man ran wild in a crowded supermarket,
stabbing shoppers and staff with a Swiss Army knife and another with a
four-inch blade.
Last night, police were questioning a local man, believed to be a 23-year-old
part-time shelf-stacker at the Netto supermarket in Bordesley Green,
Birmingham, who was arrested outside the store shortly after the incident.
Four of the victims suffered serious injuries but doctors said their heavy
winter clothes probably saved their lives.   Surgeons at Heartlands Hospital in
Birmingham, where nine of the casualties were taken, operated on a 65-year-old
man, the oldest victi
m, who has a serious stab wound in his               stomach.
Two of the casualties had been discharged by last night and all were said to be
in stable condition.
One of the victims, Mark Edwards, 15, from King's Heath, Birmingham, speaking
from his hospital bed as he recovered from a back wound, said he had gone into
the store with his parents and nine-year-old sister Elizabeth.
``I could hear a commotion and I thought it was a shoplifter,'' he said.
``Everyone started to head towards the exits and then I saw a man running down
with two knives in his hands.
``He was just jabbing and stabbing with the knives as he came by. My sister was
standing still and he was going towards her. So I grabbed her and just pushed
her through the exit.
``I turned round to go out myself and then felt like I had been punched in the
back.''
It was not until he got outside the store that his father found he was covered
in blood and had been stabbed.
His father, Robert, 47, drove him to the hospital. He said: ``It was not until
we saw the knives that we realised it was something very serious. We have all
been very lucky to get out alive.''
Another victim, lorry driver Dennis Cooksey, 57, from Castle Vale, Birmingham,
was stabbed in the shoulder as he walked around the store with his wife Joan.
``I was standing right by the rubber doors to the storeroom and I must have
been the first one he stabbed,'' said Mr Cooksey, a father of four.
``I tried to get after him but could feel my shoulder going numb and had to
stop. The larger knife had a jagged edge on one side.''
Mr Cooksey said he believed his coat, a Christmas present from his wife, had
probably saved his life.
``I got this thick, quilted coat for Christmas and that is what really saved
me,'' he said. ``The blade had to go through that coat, my jumper, and my shirt
before reaching me.''
Three knives were recovered after the attack, including a four-inch
single-edged Bowie-type knife and a Swiss Army knife. A Stanley knife recovered
was not used.
Mr Carl Ball, the area manager for the store, said: ``This is as much a shock
to us as to everyone else. We are very, very distressed and are launching a
full investigation.''
The shop is likely to remain closed for several days.
Doctors at Heartlands Hospital confirmed the victims' winter clothes had helped
lessen their injuries.
Mr Robert Holl-Allen, the senior consultant surgeon, who operated on the
65-year-old man, said: ``Without heavy clothes, the knife would have penetrated
the abdomen another inch and a half and could have brought a major injury. If
that had happened then h
e could have been dead within five minutes.''
The youngest casualty, a 13-year-old boy, suffered a chest wound. All the
victims live locally.
Mr Martin Shalley, a consultant at the hospital, said: "The thing that struck
me was the utter silence when they came in. It was most disturbing. "

A TORY MP who helped precipitate a humiliating Government defeat in the Commons
this month by turning up too late to vote receives a knighthood in the New
Year's Honours List.......for political service.
Michael Spicer (above) who - according to Tory sources - arrived at the Commons
at 10pm rather than 7pm to find Labour had already won a debate on Euro fishing
policy by two votes, was one of three Tory back benchers to be knighted.
The 52-year-old Euro-sceptic former Minister was one of the ringleaders of the
Maastricht revolt and voted consistently against the Government until the Bill
was passed.
However, since then, as leader of the Fresh Start group of sceptics, he has
sought to influence Tory European policy from the inside. It was he who
conducted peace moves with whipless Conservative MPs in a bid to bring them
back into the party fold.
All have since returned, except Sir Richard Body, MP for Holland-with-Boston.
The Government was severely embarrassed when it emerged it could have won the
fishing vote this month, but for two of its MPs, Mr Spicer and Sir Michael
Marshall, who turned up too late.
Sources claimed Mr Spicer and Sir Michael had mistaken the timing of the vote,
despite a three-line whip, but friends of Mr Spicer insisted that he had ``made
an arrangement'' with the Whips' Office. Although he is a Euro-sceptic, they
said he had not del
iberately abstained and would have voted with the Government.

<HEADLINE>Tribunal strikes off one solicitor and fines another #2000</HEADLINE>

ONE lawyer has been struck off and another fined #2000 after being found guilty
of professional misconduct by the Scottish Solicitors Discipline Tribunal.
The tribunal ruled that Mr Alexander Hastings of Inverroy, Roy Bridge,
Inverness-shire, was no longer a fit and proper person to remain on the roll of
practising solicitors.
In a separate case, the tribunal imposed a #2000 fine on Bernard Hill, of
Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow, for breaches of the solicitors' accounts rules.
Mr Hill has lodged an appeal at the Court of Session both against the finding
of professional misconduct made against him and the fine.
Mr Hastings, 49, has been a solicitor since 1973 and practised in Fort William,
at first on his own and latterly as a consultant with another firm.
In March 1993, he was instructed by a building society in connection with a
loan of #102,500 which was to be secured over Fiddich Lodge at Fiddich View,
Craigellachie, Banffshire.
Standard securities, giving security over the property, had already been
recorded in favour of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclay's Bank.
The tribunal stated that, before cashing the loan cheque and dealing with the
funds, Mr Hastings had a professional duty to ensure that he was in a position
to record a standard security in favour of the building society. It was also
necessary to discharg
e the prior securities.
However, Mr Hastings cashed the loan cheque on March 9, 1993, but failed to
record the necessary deeds.
The tribunal found him guilty of professional misconduct for cashing the
building society cheque when he was not in a position to record a clear title
in favour of the borrower or an effective standard security in favour of the
lender.
The tribunal stated that the gravity of Mr Hastings's failure to record the
necessary deeds was clearly demonstrated by subsequent events.
He left the building society without security and the borrower defaulted on the
loan repayments from an early date. It soon became apparent that Mr Hastings
had also failed to obtain a discharge for the borrower's previous loan over the
same property and
that the borrower was insolvent.
The tribunal also found that Mr Hastings had provided inadequate professional
services in winding up a woman's estate and reduced his fee for the work by
#700.
Mr Hill, 56, a former fiscal who has been a solicitor since 1967, set up on his
own account in 1987 as Hills in Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow.
The tribunal ruled that he had breached the accounts rules by having three
separate shortages on his client account, amounting in total to #590.
The rules state that solicitors must ensure at all times that cash in their
client account shall not be less than the total of clients' money held by the
solicitor.
The purpose of the rule is to ensure that the lawyer has enough funds in the
account to meet the total of all sums due by him to individual clients.

SCOTTISH Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace last night welcomed Miss
Nicholson's defection from the Tory ranks and put her move firmly in the
context of a controversy over Europe involving Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth.
The Scottish Secretary, it emerged last night, has abandoned the practice of
predecessors Ian Lang and Malcolm Rifkind by refusing to accept an invitation
to become a patron of the European Movement - in what has been seen as part of
the Tory leadership's
change of tack to the Right.
Welcoming Ms Nicholson to the Liberal Democrat fold, Mr Wallace said: ``We
welcome our newest member to the Parliamentary party and this underlines how
far John Major and his Government have moved from the centre ground and their
principles on European po
licy.
``The Conservative Party is running away from Britain's destiny in Europe. We
have always known that fault-lines were there in the Conservative Party. Now
they have become all too apparent.''
Mr Wallace said an example of this was Mr Forsyth's rejection of the invitation
to become a patron of the all-party European Movement. ``I think it is very
regrettable and it calls into question his commitment to Scotland's future as
part of the European
Union,'' he said.
Others invited, including all the heads of all the Scottish parties, had
accepted ``more or less by return post'', but Mr Forsyth put up a series of
questions and held off, before telling them in November that he was declining.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson last night called the rejection a
``calculated political snub'', caused by Mr Forsyth's extreme anti-European
views and another move to distance himself from Labour's more mainstream
approach in Scotland.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said: ``A Secretary of State who is a
Euro-sceptic runs against the interests of Scotland in Europe and against the
feelings of the Scottish people.''
