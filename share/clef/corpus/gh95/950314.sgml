BEFORE eventually being granted bail pending an appeal against
conviction and sentence, Dennis Wise may have been shocked and close to
tears as he was sent down for three months yesterday for having
assaulted a taxi driver. There will be many who believe the punishment
was excessive.
They will claim Wise was singled out because of who he is, but if the
Chelsea captain, had escaped with a financial reprimand, many more
people might have been entitled to believe that to be a far greater
injustice in itself.
Surprise at Wise's jailhouse term could be born out of an arrogant
misapprehension that football and footballers are above the law, and to
be perfectly frank, the courts have helped to foster that delusion by
their reluctance to take action against superstars.
However, the Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court in London proved
yesterday that bloated salaries, flash cars, and the adulation of tens
of thousands does not bestow upon anyone the right to behave in an
unaccaptable manner with impunity, although Tony Banks, Labour MP for
Newham North West, described the sentence as ''outrageous.''
Banks, who provided a character reference for Wise, added: ''The
sentence is out of all proportion to the offence. I get the feeling the
magistrate has been trying to make a name for himself like some ham
actor.''
MPs, of course, know all about playing to galleries, and Banks'
statements will do little to help football believe its image is being
tarnished by a series of incidents on and off the pitch. The sport has
always believed it should be self-policing, but a glance at football's
crime sheets suggests the struggle against abusive behaviour is far from
won.
Of course, Wise's attack on a 65-year-old taxi driver last month was
far away from the pitch, but because of the nature of a business in
which strong and aggressive attitudes are encouraged and celebrated,
there is always the likelihood these characteristics will surface in the
outside world. Yesterday Wise, who was convicted of common assault and
criminal damage, was shown society's equivalent of the red card.
That is how it works in a civilised society and football must learn to
live by the same codes.
Indeed, football is fortunate in that the constables who plod around
the track during matches have not felt the collars of some of the more
robust tacklers, and if they day ever arrives when the law feels the
people's game has grown too disrespectful of outside forces, the
repercussions could be arresting. Football, especially in the south,
should be concerned.
The most recent controversies have centred around London where anyone
with lots of money, but short on sense, easily can stray. The bright
lights tend to blind impressionable young sportsmen, who sometimes
finish up shadows of their former selves.
Arsenal's Tony Adams served a jail sentence a few years ago after a
conviction for drinking and driving, and another Highbury player, Paul
Merson, admitted cocaine, alcohol, and gambling addictions last
November. The same London club sacked their manager, George Graham,
after a Premier League inquiry and allegations that he had received
#425,000 following transfers of John Jensen and Pal Lyderson.
Tottenham Hotspur also were embroiled in controversy last year when
the FA found them guilty of having made irregular payments to players.
The Spurs chairman, Alan Sugar, considered legal action against former
employees who included former manager Terry Venables, who is now
England's leader.
Earlier this month, Chris Armstrong, who is valued at #5m, had to be
left out of Crystal Palace's side on FA instructions after having tested
positive for cannabis, and let us not forget Vinny Jones. The Wimbledon
defender was dropped for three matches after he had bit a reporter's
nose in a Dublin bar in February.
Jones snapped around the same time English fans were rioting and
causing the abandonment of England's friendly international against the
Republic of Ireland, and the same month, Belgian police had to deport
around 800 people following violent scenes before and after Chelsea's
Europen Cup-winners' Cup quarter-final first-leg tie in Brugge.
February, in fact, was a bad month for the game in the south because
mounted police were in action at Stamford Bridge, where there was a
pitch invasion by Chelsea fans during an FA Cup tie against Millwall.
Still in February a fan ran on to Ewood Park and tried to attack the
referee of Blackburn Rovers' home game against Leeds United.
In January, Manchester United's Eric Cantona shocked the sporting
world with his assault on a Crystal Palace fan at Selhurst Park and the
Frenchman has been charged with common assault and is banned from
playing until September 30. He was also fined #20,000 by United and
#10,000 by the FA.
However, he was then accused of attacking ITN reporter Terry Lloyd in
February and earlier this month Paul Ince was charged with common
assault for his part in the trouble at Selhurst.
When Bruce Grobbelaar was at the centre of match-fixing allegations
last November the FA must have hoped that would be the most serious
matter with which they would have to deal, but they have been stumbling
from one controversy to another ever since.

RANGERS' small army of employees will be given their biggest test to
date when they will be asked to work through the night to have their
stadium, pitch, catering facilities, and fresh advertising hoardings in
pristine order for their home game with Aberdeen less than 24 hours
after having accommodated the Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final between
Hibs and Celtic, which will be televised live by Sky TV on Friday, April
7.
The decision to stage the cup match at Ibrox was yesterday taken by
the SFA, but only after discussions with Rangers who were determined not
to have their own league match disturbed.
The other semi also is affected by the Ibrox ruling because the
Airdrie-Hearts game, at Hampden on April 8, will kick off at 2.0 on
police advice to avoid traffic congestion with the crowd at Ibrox for
the league match.
Rangers secretary Campbell Ogilvie acknowledged the mammoth task the
Ibrox staff face to have everything in order for the league match. ''It
is a big job, but we will do it,'' he said. ''The one thing we were
determined about was that our league game would not be switched. We did
that to accommodate the Coca-Cola Cup final in November, but we would
have turned down the semi-final this time if it meant a change of our
match. Our fans have been disturbed enough already.''
Athough it will cost Rangers a considerable amount in overtime
payments to have the ground ready for the cup-tie, there will be ample
compensation in the #100,000 they will receive for the use of their
stadium.
The decison to take the Celtic game to Ibrox avoids any controversy
that would have ensued, had the SFA opted to put both semis on at
Hampden which Celtic have been using on a regular basis this season as
their home ground while work on the new stadium goes on at Parkhead.
Celtic are happy with the decision and a club spokesman insisted last
night: ''We are amenable to any venue and hope that the ticket
allocation will satisfy the 37,000 Celtic supporters who attended the
League Cup semi-final at the same stadium.''
However, if Celtic reach the final the arguments will be revived
because the final will be played at Hampden, whoever is involved.
That decision, confirmed yesterday, delighted Queen's Park stadium
director Austin Reilly. ''I know that Coca-Cola were unhappy that the
League Cup final was played at Ibrox,'' he said, ''and not at the
traditional home of Scottish football, and I suspect cup sponsors
Tennents would have felt the same way.''

PETER Wright, Scotland's tight-head prop, is out to prove that he is
the right man for the job in the Grand Slam showdown with England at
Twickenham on Saturday.
The Bonnyrig blacksmith's credentials are copper-bottomed in Scotland,
but two years ago, with the British Lions in New Zealand, Wright and the
other Scotland tight forwards were subject to much criticism from
Sassenach quarters.
Jason Leonard, Wright's direct opponent on Saturday, was one of the
beneficiaries of the carping. He has won all of his 37 England caps on
the scrummage loose head, but he was moved across the front row to fill
the right-hand berth for two of the Tests against the All Blacks.
Wright, who has been in devastating form for Boroughmuir and Scotland
this season, is still miffed by the criticism which came his way in New
Zealand, so his confrontation with Leonard provides added spice to a
Twickenham encounter already overflowing with tasty vignettes.
''Yes, Jason was shifted across to fill the tight-head role in New
Zealand but, to be honest, I'm not approaching the game with personal
vendettas in mind.
''There's no point in that. We are going down to do the business
against the English, but it will be a team effort.
Wright's powerful running off short-yardage ball has been a feature of
Scotland's rejuvenated season.
''The side has changed from being an out and out rucking outfit,
winning the ball and then giving it to the stand-off to put high balls
up in the air. We still ruck when the occasion demands it, but we also
have the option to play running rugby now which, to be honest, is much
more my kind of game.''
The prop, who wins his tenth cap on Saturday, maintains that the
spirit in this Scotland side is like nothing he has experienced before.
''We've got a lot of winners in the team now. Guys like Dave Hilton
who hasn't been on any losing side for a year. Most of us have come up
through the A team. The whole front five apart from Kevin McKenzie came
up into the senior side and we had got used to winning.
''There's a good mix in the side now. It's a perfect blend. Saturday's
game will be the biggest match that many of us have played in. It is
even bigger than the Grand Slam game in 1990. That was up here but on
Saturday we go into the lion's den at Twickenham.
''Let's just say we're quietly confident. We have faith in our ability
as a team, but even if we lose on Saturday -- which we won't -- then
it's still been a great season. We have come from nowhere when everybody
was writing us off, and this team is still building for the World Cup in
the summer.
''We go down confident that we can give a good account of ourselves.
''If we didn't have that confidence then there would be no point in
getting on the plane. But whoever wins, it's going to be a great
weekend.''
* ENGLAND'S satisfaction at their three Five Nations Championship wins
which have set up Saturday's Grand Slam clash with Scotland shines
brightly from Kyran Bracken. The scrum-half has made that position his
own this season, demoting Dewi Morris to the England replacements'
bench.
And Bracken looks back to this time last year when he was on the bench
and England's play was not met with universal approval. ''We have scored
tries this season but as we approached the final game last year people
were asking 'when are England going to score tries?' We had not crossed
the opposition's line in four games.
''But three tries per game against Ireland, France and Wales have
meant nobody is complaining this time. It has been a question of how
many tries we would score.''

RUGBY'S top rulers had an easy task in deciding in favour of Wales
rather than Australia for the next World Cup compared with the complex
issues they have been debating for a week.
Amateurism and relations with Rugby League are top problems, and the
board will deliver their latest views in Bristol today.
Despite lurid stories emerging from the Southern Hemisphere, officials
insist there is a world-wide desire to keep the game amateur. There
cannot be a professional core -- officially.
But, within that increasingly loose ideal, there is still scope for
further reward for players, and Wales are suggesting that many of the
rules be relaxed to give players almost all available benefits short of
being paid for playing.
However, the board are aware that there are some rich nations in rugby
terms, as well as some impoverished countries, and legislating for
wealthy South Africa and stony-broke Romania is the nightmare.
Australia and New Zealand have proposed that it should be easier for
Rugby League players to re-enter Rugby Union. They want a suspension of
two years after the last RL appearance, but there is still no intention
of allowing former RL players to play Test rugby again.
The different lengths of suspensions handed out to sent-off players
has become near-farcical and the board intends to set minimum and
consistent bans.
The red and yellow-card system introduced in England this winter will
be reviewed with a view to widening the procedure.
Other topics include making the game medically and physically safer,
finance, tours and the constitution of the board.

NO ONE needs to take Gary Mackay aside and remind him of just how
momentous the weeks that lie ahead could be for his team. The opposite
is the case. Mackay will be the one who will have a quiet word with the
younger players in the Hearts squad as they make their way towards a
Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final with Airdrie next month.
Mackay has been at Tynecastle through all the great traumas, the near
things, the high hopes, the depressions, but he is still waiting to show
us a medal after 15 years in the trenches on behalf of the team he has
always supported.
Gary is in no danger of being overcome with irrational optimism. The
year 1985 made sure of that. Inside one painful week, in the Spring,
Gary, along with one or two others still in the squad -- like Henry
Smith and Craig Levein -- saw the premier-division title as well as the
Scottish Cup snatched from Hearts' grasp, and nothing can ever be quite
as devastating.
Yet it is the recollection of that numbing experience which Mackay,
the longest serving player at Tynecastle, wants to use to help paint the
proper picture for the younger men in the current side.
''It is true that this is probably my last chance to get to the final
and win the cup,'' he said as he and his team mates enjoyed the
after-glow of their quarter final win over Dundee United on Sunday,
''but I want to emphasise to the others that it could be theirs as well.
''When we lost out in 1985, we assumed we would have plenty of other
chances to win a major trophy but they never came. That is why I want
the younger lads to appreciate that it is just as important for them to
look at this as their last chance. I want them really to go for it
because you can't be sure you will get another opportunity.''
Mackay was back at the ground yesterday wearing his other hat, as one
of the club's commercial managers, and in that role, Sunday's win gave
him almost as much pleasure as doing his bit on the park. The spin-off
from the defeat of United will mean that the commercial activities at
Gorgie Road will be kept very much alive over the weeks leading up to
the semi-fnal and, Mackay hopes, beyond.
''If we get to the final, in commercial terms it means the equivalent
of another three months' business for us,'' he said when he found time
between answering the Tynecastle phone and taking groups around the park
in mini-tours.
The 31-year-old midfield man, who turned down offers from Manchester
United, Rangers, and Spurs to join Hearts as a 15-year-old, does not
hide behind the predictable cliches when he assess his team's prospects
of beating first division Airdrie. ''Most people will say we have been
given the easier draw, and, strictly in league terms, that is true. We
have to believe we are a better team because the leagues already show
that.''
It is then that Mackay introduces another bitter memory, the day his
team went down in a penalty shoot-out in a semi-final replay with the
same Airdrie three years ago. ''History teaches us a terrible lesson
when we talk about playing Airdrie, and that is enough to remind us what
we have in front of us.''
That shoot-out defeat was the day that Mackay's former chairman,
Wallace Mercer, knew he was nearing the end of his stint in charge at
Tynecastle. The cup exit changed the financial prognosis of the club
dramatically, and brought about the sale of Dave McPherson to Rangers a
couple of months later. The graph was on the wane from then, and Mercer
knew that his last chance of seeing the club triumph in a cup final had
gone.
Now it is the new regime, under chairman Chris Robinson, which waits
to see if Airdrie are about to shatter ambitions or Hearts can create
exciting financial possibilities once again.
It is not easy to decide who wants victory more, Mackay the player or
Mackay the salesman, but if the team make it through to the final, they
will both have a rare night out.

ONE problem area for Scotland as they pursue at Twickenham what would
be their greatest triumph is in neutralising England's various methods
of launching big loose forwards either at the Scottish midfield, or as a
means of pinning down the Scottish breakaways.
They also will have difficulty in reducing the effectiveness of
England's mauling, especially if the Ulster headmaster, Brian Stirling,
turns a Nelson eye on those large English men who insert themselves in
front of their ball carrier, thus effecting an obstructive block.
England use much of their set piece ball simply to launch their huge
loose forwards at the opposition's soft belly. As one example, Rob
Andrew took lineout ball very flat against Wales and fed Will Carling,
who already was on his way back towards the forwards. When Ben Clarke
crashed on and England quickly re-delivered, it was then that they let
the ball ripple.
England also made use of their front jumper, Martin Johnson, in a
four-man line for ball that Andrew simply shifted straight to Clarke,
who made a dent as an inside centre.
Right wing Tony Underwood was used also as a crash-ball intruder at
pace between stand-off and inside centre with the aim also of
compromising midfield defence formation so that subsequent English
handling attack would be against a splintered line. Once give Carling
and company a sniff of quick replenished possession with the opposing
defence temporarily disorientated, and their handling and running gifts
find full expression, as in their acquisition of nine championship
tries, seven by their backs, five by their wings.
Having regard to the Scottish loose fowards' advantage in pace about
the paddock, it will be an English priority to take them out of the
action as often as possible. Once, in the Welsh match, Dean Richards
lifted at a scrummage that tilted slightly left and fed Tim Rodber
charging from right to left. From re-delivery, Andrew sent Clarke
charging at a different target.
It is now very difficult for a pack to cope with heavier opponents who
are well drilled in the art of moving their mauls. England are all of
that.
Certainly English mauling reached a pinnacle against Wales with a
moving mass over 20 metres in which the ball had a human shield all
round it until Victor Ubogu rolled off for a drive-over try.
England also seem to have altered their restart kicks which now are
not directed towards the touchline but are lofted so as to drop further
infield, thus opening up each flank for subsequent attack play.
So much of the modern game at international level is predictable that
it isn't easy to catch opponents by surprise. Still, if Scotland win the
toss, they should opt for the kick-off, then send it along the ground to
just over the 10 metres line and straight at Clarke and Brian Moore who
tend to be nearest. With the Scottish stormtroopers close behind the
ball that would give those two an early physical reminder that this
indeed is Scotland they are playing.
It is as well that this Scottish squad has its feet firmly on the
ground, and is not affected by grim statistics. As one example this will
be the ninth time that Scotland have gone to Twickenham with a Triple
Crown to be won. They have succeeded just once. That was in 1938 when
the brilliant Wilson Shaw of Glasgow High School FP led Scotland to a
stunning 21-16 win.
Scotland's pack this time will be over half-a-stone a man lighter. The
English have 139 more caps. Their backs have shared 81 international
tries, Scotland's 25. England's midfield trio will play together for the
thirty-first time, Scotland's for only the second. England have 11
Lions, Scotland five. England have nine championship tries and conceded
two, Scotland six and six. Fifty of Scotland's 75 points have come from
Gavin Hastings.
Yet this has been such a fairytale championship that the following
scenario is sure to be enacted. England leading 26-24. Gavin Hastings,
with the last kick of the game, a penalty attempt from 55 metres. It
soars over. The touch judge flags are raised. The final whistle sounds.
The future Lord Hastings joins Dan Drysdale, Wilson Shaw, Peter Brown
and Jim Aitken as the only Scots to lead a winning team against England
at Twickenham. This fixture certainly owes Andrew Gavin one. Hallelujah.

THE Babe Zaharias Ladies' Open will return after an absence of 14
years to centenary club, Torphin Hill, in Edinburgh where it began in
1963. The prize up for grabs is the last golf trophy won by the
American, widely regarded as the greatest female athlete of this century
before she died of cancer in 1956, aged 41.
The tournament, scheduled for June 3, is open to women golfers with
handicaps of 30 or less. The main interest, however, will centre on the
scratch prize, a solid silver rosebowl, two feet in diameter and
inscribed ''Serbin Open -- Miami 1955.'' It was donated to Torphin Hill,
who wanted to stage a tournament in her honour to raise money for cancer
research, by The Babe's husband George, an ex-professional wrestler.
Born Mildred Didrikson, the sixth of seven children of Norwegian
immigrants, she earned the nickname Babe after the baseball player Babe
Ruth when she hit five home runs in one game. Before taking up golf, she
excelled at virtually every sport she tried, and in the 1932 Olympics,
she set records in winning the javelin and 80 metres hurdles. She tied
first for high jump, but was disqualified for going over head first, a
technique now perfectly legal.
As a golfer, she regularly outdrove men, and when asked the secret of
her prodigious hitting, she would reply: ''Why, I just loosen my girdle
and let fly.'' Among the places she loosened her girdle was at Gullane,
where she became the first American to take the British Ladies'
Championship trophy across the Atlantic in 1947.
Torphin Hill staged the Babe Zaharias Open until 1981, after which
other clubs took their turns. Last year, at Craigmillar Park, more than
#2000 was raised for the Cancer Research Campaign Scotland.
A field of 180 players is expected, the entry fee is a bargain #5, and
men at the 400-member club have promised to act as caddies.
Among those who have already promised to take part is Belle Robertson,
the former Curtis Cup player and captain, who won the trophy in 1971
with what was then a ladies' course record of 68, three under par.
Jessie Valentine from Perth, the three-times British champion is another
former winner, and she also will be there too, though in a non-playing
capacity. She is 80 on Saturday.
Another of the Torphin Hill events is the George Zaharias mixed
foursomes on September 3 for a trophy put up by the man himself when he
visited the club some years ago.
Other events on the centenary calendar include the Federation Shield
on May 22, open to teams of three from businesses with golf societies in
the spirit of the club's founders, the Edinburgh Establishment Golf Club
Federation.
They played on Braidhills, but found the course so congested that 10
years later they founded Torphin Hill.
Club captain Donald Campbell said: ''We believe our beginnings to be
unique. Membership initially was confined to establishments covered by
the Factories Act. The Federation Shield, which was bought for #11,
dates right back to the start and the competition is a tradition which
has been maintained over the years.
''Many of the founders were printers. Our first captain, A J Gillies,
was a proof reader and even today many of our members belong to the
printing trade.''
The club on the Pentland foothills nowadays has a long waiting list
and a testing course with a par of 67 (SSS 66) and panoramic views
ranging from Bass Rock in the east, Trossachs to the north, and Bathgate
to the west.
There also will be a 100-a-side match on July 26 with Craigmillar Park
and Duddingston, also centenary clubs.
Another unusual centenary competition is to be held at the New Course,
St Andrews, which was constructed following the first Act of Parliament
concerning the links in 1894. It is hailed as probably the oldest
''new'' course in the world and a Grant Tournament for 100 local golfers
is to be held there on April 9.
Applications must be in by next Monday. The first 80 will be accepted,
and if the remaining places are oversubscribed, there will be a ballot.
Two rules will be introduced to put players in the right spirit.
Competitors must putt with hickory-shafted clubs, and also hit their

EDINBURGH Racers have been paying their players too much -- and now
they are being made to pay for it. But angry club officials have vowed
to fight all the way.
The British Ice Hockey Association fined Racers #5000, and cut five
points from the Premier Division side's tally yesterday.
But Racers' director Stuart Robertson hit back: ''We've not breached
the rules by even a half-penny.'' Racers, who are certain to appeal, are
one of five top clubs to have been hit in the crackdown.
Premier pace-setters Nottingham Panthers, their closest rivals in the
title race Sheffield Steelers, last season's league champions Cardiff
Devils, and mid-table Division One squad Guildford Flames, were all
handed the same punishment.

* THE English Football Association has insisted that both FA Cup
semi-finals will be played away from Wembley.
Tottenham's match with Everton will be played at Elland Road on April
9, while Manchester United's game with either Crystal Palace or Wolves
is to be staged at Villa Park on the same day.
The FA believe both grounds are ideal venues as they will be used for
the European Championships next year.

CARETAKER manager Roy Aitken admitted yesterday that Aberdeen are
finding it difficult to handle the pressures of fighting to avoid
relegation.
But he insisted that the Dons would get it right and avoid the drop to
the first division.
Aitken revealed after having watched his side throw away a two-goal
lead and two points at Firhill: ''Not only are we inconsistent from game
to game, we are inconsistent within the same game.
''It is very difficult to put your finger on the reasons for this but
obviously when things are going against us we don't seem to be able to
handle it the way we should.
''Right now we are making it easy for our critics and players in other
teams to have a go.
''We are also taking pressure off other teams in the same situation by
keeping the spotlight focused on ourselves.
''As far as I am concerned we will work even harder in training to get
it right. I firmly believe that what you put into training you will get
out in match days.
''Our next two games -- against Hibs and Kilmarnock at home -- are now
vital. We must take maximum points to close the gap on the teams above
us.''
Aitken expects injured pair Duncan Shearer and Paul Kane to be fit to
return against Hibs on Saturday. Centre back John Inglis is also
available after a two-match ban.

THE uncertainty surrounding the future of the Forum, Scotland's only
purpose-built basketball centre, was compounded when the Livingston
Bulls v Edinburgh Burger Kings men's league game -- a match which could
have had a vital bearing on the destination of the title -- had to be
moved at less than an hour's notice, to a nearby school because of a
double booking.
An official of Marco's Leisure, who manage the Forum on behalf of
Livingston Development Corporation, insisted that the double booking had
nothing to do with them but the club are angry at the way they have been
treated.
They have been unhappy for some time at the threat to the sprung
wooden floor, one of the best basketball surfaces in the country, posed
by the staging of rock concerts and other such leisure activities at the
venue.
When the Scottish Basketball Association expressed concern about the
future of the building to LDC, they were told that there might be a
better option for the sport on another site in the town.
That is believed to be Almondvale Stadium, which will be the new home
of Meadowbank Thistle Football Club and where there are plans for a
multi-sports facility.

DUNDEE United manager Ivan Golac defiantly proclaimed last night: ''I
am not afraid of the sack.''
Speculation mounted over his future when they crashed out of the
Scottish Cup to Hearts at Tynecastle. The 2-1 defeat cost them their
grip on a trophy which was won for the first time in their history last
season, and came hard on the heels of league defeats by Kilmarnock and
Partick Thistle which have thrown them into the relegation issue.
United chairman Jim McLean would not enter the debate over his
manager's future. ''I have no comment to make. The only thing which
concerns me is Saturday's game at Motherwell and trying to ensure we
prepare properly for that occasion.''
With the usual board meeting due today, and then on Friday, it would
be surprising if Golac's position was not discussed.
Golac was more forthcoming and made it clear he will go on doing his
job until he is told the situation is otherwise.
He said: ''There has been speculation about my job here since I
arrived in Scotland and I was asked if I realised how hard the task
would be. It didn't concern me then and it doesn't concern me now.
''The trouble in this country is that too many people seem to live in
fear, and not just in football. I find that sad.
0
''The only pressure I feel on me is that I am a bit tired after going
three years without a proper break. I have never feared the sack. So why
bother about it?''
And Golac made it clear his positive attitude had not been dented by
recent events at Tannadice. He said: ''There are more trophies waiting
for me here, there, or anywhere else I might go. That has been my
mentality throughout life, and that won't change.
''Right now, there are two months of my contract left with United and
I want to get on with the job of improving our situation as much as
possible. There are 27 League points at stake over the rest of the
season and that means plenty to play for.''

MOTHERWELL, who are next on the Partick Thistle hit list at Firhill
tonight, hope to sign Dutch defender Mitchell van de Gaag in a #400,000
deal before the transfer deadline at the end of the month.
Manager Alex McLeish watched the PSV Eindhoven man last week and he
has now started talks with his club. He said yesterday: ''Van de Gaag
has a great presence and looks ideally suited to the physical demands of
the Scottish game.''
Meanwhile, it might be a good idea for supporters of McLeish's old
club, Aberdeen, to get to bed early tonight and avoid the possibility of
a fitful sleep if their team has been demoted to bottom club in the
premier division.
That would be the situation if Thistle come up with another of their
energetic performances and beat Motherwell tonight.
If they achieve that, Thistle would lift themselves off the bottom and
still have a game in hand, leaving Aberdeen in a position to which they
are unaccustomed.
None of this is discussed at any length inside the Maryhill portals.
Thistle manager John Lambie and his staff have been over the course
too often to concern themselves about the implications of one win or
another. They go out and work for their money and then see what is next
on the schedule.
It is a simple but effective way of coping with the pressures of life
at the bottom, and maybe Aberdeen will have to learn how it is done to
save their own skins this season.
Other than Alex Taylor, who is out because of injury, Lambie has a
full complement of players from which to choose, and is contemplating a
change from the side that fought back so well after having gone two
goals down against Aberdeen at the weekend.
''I won't decide until nearer kick-off,'' said Lambie, ''I want to
give it a lot of thought, because this is a big game for us.''
Motherwell could do themselves a favour if they beat Thistle because
that would lift them five points clear of Hibs in second place in the
division and enhance their prospects of a UEFA Cup place next season.
Motherwell will have Billy Davies available again after suspension but
Tommy Coyne is not yet fit to return.

WALTER Smith, the Rangers manager, was in Italy again at the weekend
as he continues to scour the Continent for the players he wants to
parade at Ibrox next season.
This time he watched Genoa -- just as he did two weeks ago -- but it
was their opponents who interested Smith this time around.
In particular the manager was monitoring the position of Portugal's
international striker Jorge Cadete, a name familiar to any Scotland fan
who saw the forward destroy the international team two years ago.
Then, in a World Cup tie, the Scots lost 5-0 in the Stadium of Light
in Lisbon and Cadete helped himself to two of the goals.
Since then he has been sold by Sporting Club to Brescia, who now sit
at the bottom of Serie A and who lost 1-0 in Genoa on Sunday to compound
their relegation problems.
If Brescia go down, Cadete would be available. It is certain that he
would not accept relegation with the team and Smith, keeping his ear to
the ground, must realise that.
Cadete would come to Ibrox highly recommended. Captain Richard Gough
has cause to remember the powerful front man and has often spoken of his
outstanding ability.
The Portuguese player is just 26 years old and he has a style which
would suit the British game.
More important for Smith, he also would add significantly to the
stuttering fire power at Ibrox, so much curtailed this season because of
injuries.
There was no confirmation from Ibrox yesterday of where Smith had gone
at the weekend, but he was in Genoa and it was a Brescia player he
wanted to check out. Cadete only played for the last quarter of an hour
but Smith's mission would be as much to find out about his availability
as to assess his strengths. They are, after all, known to everyone in
Scotland.
Back at Ibrox, Smith did expand on the generalities which surround the
transfer market these days. And he insisted that quality men would
arrive at Ibrox in the summer.
''I have been surprised at the way people go on about Rangers having
to buy players immediately,'' he admitted. ''We want to buy players. We
want to get new players in. But players must be available before we can
get them.
''We cannot buy if clubs won't sell to us.
''But, at the end of this season we will be bringing in quality
players. Look, this club has never been guilty of sitting still when
there is money to spend. And we won't be this year either.
''What you have to remember is that there is great responsibility on
managers now. There is so much money involved and you have to get the
right players. That is what we are doing.
''We are in the process of rebuilding our side. To do that we have let
players go to make room for fresh men to come in. And they will come in.
''There will be squad players and good quality players who will join
up at Ibrox. There is no doubting that this has been a difficult year.
We have had more long-term injuries than I have ever experienced here.
''And we have been allowing players to move out as well and so we have
had problems. But we do have to make these changes and they cannot take
place overnight.
''We will continue to look for the players of the quality we want and
some of them will be here.''

ALLEN Johnson, the newly-crowned World indoor sprint hurdles champion,
warned yesterday that he will use his freshly-minted confidence to tear
down Colin Jackson from his outdoor throne.
''The next time I beat Jackson, I won't need a photo to tell me I have
won,'' said the American, who claimed the indoor 60 metres title in
Barcelona on Sunday.
Johnson recently beat Jackson in Madrid, both clocking the same time.
It was Jackson's first defeat in more than 40 races, but the Welshman
opted not to race in Spain. That decision may prove to be a tactical
error on his part.
For Johnson took the opportunity to consolidate, then warned, after
his win over Tony Jarrett, that he is ready to put Jackson under even
greater pressure. Johnson, whose mother talked him out of American
football because she reckoned hurdling was safer, said: ''I'm looking
forward to running against Colin outdoors. When I beat him in Madrid, it
was a real psychological breakthrough.
''So often Colin has beaten people by huge margins, and although they
wouldn't admit it, they were probably beaten before the gun went. I
don't feel like that any more.
''I shall be closing the gap on him this summer, but I know I've got
to be looking to break the 13-second barrier if I am going to compete
with him.''
Britain's chief coach, Malcolm Arnold, who is also Jackson's mentor,
defends the right of leading competitors to opt out of major events --
the UK team in Spain was very short on quality.
''We have to respect their thoughts. If they want to shut off, and get
on with their preparations for the summer, that is their privilege,''
said Arnold.
But if Britain wants athletics to continue to enjoy its high profile
-- essential if it is to attract sponsorship and TV contracts -- Arnold
cannot afford to field too many teams such as this one.
The advent of prize money at all future International Amateur Athletic
Federation championships from 1997 onwards, confirmed yesterday, will
help to ensure better teams.
The International Olympic Committee refuses even to discuss the issue,
which threatens to cause a rift between the two bodies. But UK officials
must seize this further professionalism of the sport as the chance to
put the leading performers on contracts, which would commit them to a
set number of international and championship appearances, thereby
securing the sport's as well as their financial security.

FOUR times world speedway champion Barry Briggs will ride in Scotland
for the first time in 20 years this summer.
The New Zealander, now 60, is promoting a ''Golden Greats'' meeting at
Edinburgh's Powderhall on June 4. Former world champions Ove Fundin,
Anders Michanek, and Britain's Peter Collins are expected also to take
part.
Now based in America, it is only the second meeting of this kind
Briggs has staged in Britain. ''The fans love it,'' he said. ''When we
held the meeting at Coventry, 8000 turned up.''
Meanwhile, Berwick Bandits have completed their line-up for the new
season by signing Darren Pearson from Bradford, and Paul Gould, who was
previously with Edinburgh and Linlithgow.

ON past performances and breeding, Attadale and Chief Minister
represent the best chances of success of the seven Scottish-trained
runners at Cheltenham this week.
Attadale, seven-year-old son of Ardross, is bred to stay and will run
in today's Astec Vodafone Gold Card Hurdle over three miles in
preference to tomorrow's Coral Cup.
A winner of nine races in two seasons, Attadale is a best-price 12-1
chance. He has not made the frame so far this season, but trainer Len
Lungo and owner Hal McGhie are confident he will go well on the soft
ground. He has top weight of 11-10lb.
''If you can forgive him his last run at Haydock, which was his worst
ever, he must be in with a chance,'' said Lungo.
Chief Minister, third to Atours at Cheltenham in November, and
successful at Newcastle twice so far this season, goes for the Coral Cup
Hurdle over two miles five furlongs tomorrow.
Tom Dyer's six-year-old son of Rainbow Quest carries just 10st 3lbs
and is fancied at the weights. Best price 16-1.
Borders' permit-holder Alistair Whillans, of Hawick, sends two to the
Festival, Sansool -- a winner at Carlisle in January -- in today's last
race on the card, and Palacegate King, in the Vincent O'Brien County
Hurdle on Thursday.
Palacegate King beat some good hurdlers, including Surrey Dancer and
Salwan, when successsful at Haydock in January.
Two of Scotland's top hunter chasers, Davy Blake, trained by Norman
Dalgetty at Jedburgh, and Jane Storey's Royal Jester, from Yetholm, run
in the Christie's Foxhunter Chase on Gold Cup day.
They have the ability to spring a surprise, but last year's winner,
Double Silk, will be very hard to beat.
Difficult to believe but Wild Atlantic, trained at Hawick by Zoe Green
and yet to run this season, is expected to line-up alongside Viking
Flagship and Travado for the Queen Mother Champion Chase -- the top
event for two-mile chasers -- tomorrow.
The 12-year-old, who won a novice chase at Carlisle in 1993, is, not
surprisingly, 2000-1.

IT was fitting 12 months ago that a Frenchman sipped the finest
champagne with an air of contentment after the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
Trainer Francois Doumen had come well within touching distance of
steeplechasing's crown on two occasions, only to look on in anguish as
his great chaser, The Fellow, found no extra up Cheltenham's punishing
final hill. C'est la vie.
But few grudged Doumen his moment last year when The Fellow finally
appeared to sprout wings after the last and struck gold.
Thursday is a different day and Doumen has different horses, but do
not be surprised if we have the same result, with the man from Chantilly
again is the toast of Cheltenham.
His two runners, Algan and Val d'Alene, have proved their worth, Algan
in taking the King George VI Chase at Kempton, and Val d'Alene when
galloping the opposition into the ground in the Racing Post Chase.
But what of the home lot? Peter Beaumont, trainer of 1993 winner
Jodami, is confident that his runner will go in again. ''I think he is
in as good a shape as he was when he took the race two years ago,'' said
the trainer.
The ground should be just about right for the favourite, Kim Bailey's
Master Oats, but whether he has enough pace is open to doubt.
And perhaps in the same category is Miinnehoma. To witness Martin Pipe
galloping down to the finish to welcome his chaser after his Grand
National success last season, one would have been forgiven for thinking
that this was Pipe's first winner.
However, his stable is a conveyor belt of success and the champion
trainer is upbeat. ''The ground will be fine for him,'' said Pipe, ''and
he is jumping out of his skin.''
So Doumen again could be the man but with which one, Algan or Val
d'Alene? Perhaps you should choose yourself, after all there is no fun
if it is all made too easy.
Bon chance.

RONNIE O'Sullivan revealed his new mean streak to knock world No.1
Stephen Hendry out of the Kloster Thailand Open in Bangkok last night.
Hendry, twice winner of the Far East crown when it was known as the
Asian Championship in 1989 and 1990, had no answer to O'Sullivan's
ruthless finishing and slumped to a 5-2 second-round defeat in just 66
minutes.
O'Sullivan rattled in breaks of 100, 91, 85, 72, and 55 during his
triumph and Hendry, who will lose his No.1 spot in the provisional world
rankings if Steve Davis wins the title on Saturday, conceded: ''No-one
will beat Ronnie when he plays like that.''
He now faces Peter Ebdon, who had an impressive 5-2 victory over Ken
Doherty, in tomorrow's quarter-finals.
Wilkinson appeared to be on his way out as McManus compiled a break of
66 in the decider. But he missed a difficult fourteenth red to gift
Wilkinson victory.

DENNIS Wise's legal battle is the least of manager Glenn Hoddle's
immediate preoccupations as he tries to revive Chelsea's European dream.
No fewer than 11 players are either ruled out or struggling to be fit
for tonight's Cup-winners' Cup quarter-final second leg against Belgian
side FC Bruges, who bring a 1-0 lead to Stamford Bridge.
''I've never experienced such a vast amount of injuries to so many
influential players,'' said Hoddle. ''I won't know the team until the
afternoon. It's not ideal but we just have to get on with it.''
Hoddle, undermined by Saturday's 3-0 home surrender to Leeds, has
called in former Arsenal veteran Graham Rix, now Chelsea's reserve
coach, and added untried reserves Michael Durberry and Mustafa 'Mussie'
Izzet.
England winger and club captain Wise, imprisoned then bailed to
appeal, gets no such on-pitch reprieve with his thigh injury likely to
keep him out for a month.
Top-scorer John Spencer (ankle) and defender Jakob Kjeldbjerg
(shoulder) are also out, along with goalkeeper Dmitri Kharine
(shoulder).
Hoddle, who last started a game on Boxing Day, is unlikely to gamble
on his own fitness.
Midfielder Eddie Newton (hamstring strain) is on the doubtful list,
along with virus victims David Hopkin, Nigel Spackman, and Scott Minto.
Andy Myers (bruised toe) and Frank Sinclair face fitness tests before
the game.

CATRIONA Matthew, the former British champion and Curtis Cup player
from North Berwick, is recuperating in Tucson, Arizona, after an
emergency operation last Thursday and hopes to fly home to Scotland this
Thursday or Friday.
Matthew, 25, in her first season as a professional, will be out of
golf for an estimated five or six weeks as she recovers from the
operation to remove a large ovarian cyst -- 7[1/2] inches by four. The
young Scot did not even know the cyst existed until she doubled up with
severe stomach pains before the first round of the Ping/Welch's
championship.
Matthew was allowed out of hospital on Sunday and Kathryn Marshall, a
former Scottish amateur team-mate also on the LPGA Tour, said: ''She's
sore and tired and keen to get home.''
Meanwhile, Caroline Pierce was top Briton at Randolph Park. She closed
with a two-over-par 74 for a four-round aggregate of two-under-par 286
to be eight shots behind runaway winner Dottie Mochrie. Leading scores
(Americans unless stated):

SCOTLAND'S Myra McKinlay and Kirsty Speak from Lancashire, two members
of last year's successful Curtis Cup side, are in a strong field of 113
starters in the 72-hole inaugural American Express Tour qualifying
school, which begins over the south course at La Manga Club in Spain
today.
Already the majority of the field have been given a timely reminder
that the life of a tournament professional is not all a bed of roses.
Practice on Sunday was an ordeal in driving rain and gale-force winds
which left the La Manga Club complex without electricity.
The leading 75 will make the cut after the second round, then the top
40 after the final round will earn their cards.

* THE first running of the Cheltenham Gold Cup was in August, 1819,
but in those days it was a flat race over three miles. The first winner,
who picked up the princely sum of 100 guineas, was Spectre.
* THE racecourse and its buildings, now run by the Cheltenham
Steeplechase company, were used as a war hospital from 1915 and racing
resumed in 1919.
* THE first three-day Festival was staged in 1923, and a year later
the first official Gold Cup was run, won by Red Splash. Three years
later, in 1927, the Champion Hurdle Challenge Cup was inaugurated in
1927 with the winner, Blaris, picking up #365.
* FOUR horses have won the Champion Hurdle three times -- Hatton's
Grace (1949-51), Sir Ken (1952-54), Persian War (1968-70), and See You
Then (1985-87). A recent poll of racing experts, conducted by race
sponsors Smurfit, places Persian War as the top Champion Hurdler, ahead
of Hattons Grace and Sir Ken.
* LAMBOURN trainer Jenny Pitman made history as the first woman
trainer to win the Gold Cup when Burrough Hill Lad won in 1984.
* MICHAEL Dickinson saddled the first five home in the Gold Cup in
1983. Bregawn, ridden by Graham Bradley, won the race, beating
stable-mates Captain John (2nd), Wayward Lad (3rd), Silver Buck (4th),
and Ashley House (5th).
* ON the fast food front, It is expected that 20,000 hamburgers and
hot dogs, 28,000 sandwiches, and 14,000 portions of chips will be eaten
in the three days, while on the drinks side, 14,000 bottles of
champagne, 20,000 bottles of wine, 50,000 bottles of beer, 14,000
gallons of beer, lager, and stout, 60,000 bottles of minerals and 3000
gallons of tea and coffee are expected to be consumed.
* BOOKINGS are 7[1/2]% up on last year, which was an improvement on
the previous year. The Cheltenham executive expect 150,000 people for
the three Festival days, with around 20,000 on Friday taking the
aggregate attendance to 170,000.

HOPES for a fourth successive Scottish victory in next month's women's
world indoor championship at Cumbernauld were dealt a severe blow
yesterday when Scotland's representation in the 16 player event was
reduced to two.
Scottish champion Catherine McIntosh was originally named in the
line-up along with holder Jan Woodley and internationalist Joyce
Lindores but Stonehaven-based McIntosh withdrew yesterday when she
confirmed she was expecting a baby later this year.
She will, however, play in Ballymoney next week in the British women's
singles championship.
The organisers of the Cumbernauld event, the World Indoor Bowls
Council Ladies Section, confirmed that Ireland's world champion Margaret
Johnston would fill McIntosh's place.
Johnston, the winner of the title in 1988 and again the following
year, was omitted from this year's event when Ireland staged their
qualifying tournament last month as Johnston was in Preston competing in
the men's world indoor championship.
Tournament director David Harrison said yesterday: ''We always have a
named player standing by in case one of the original nominations drops
out and Margaret was chosen some time ago.''

THE waiting is over. It's show time, and for followers National Hunt
racing that means just one thing, another Cheltenham Festival will be
unwrapped before a waiting nation this afternoon.
Followers of this beautiful sport will fly in from all parts of the
planet just to be there for the three days, to soak up the unique
atmosphere, and watch the best jumping horses around at work, as well as
trying to lighten the bank balance of the bookmakers.
And the race titles themselves are like the names of old friends to
the thousands who will pack into Prestbury Park this week, or to the
millions, who, for the first time, must set their television dial to
Channel 4 at Festival time.
The Stayers' Hurdle, Arkle Chase, Foxhunters' Chase, Triumph Hurdle,
Kim Muir Chase, and, of course, the Gold Cup invariably spark memories
in jump racing enthusiasts as to great races witnessed and great equine
athletes seen in action, for without doubt, Cheltenham is about the
best.
The meeting opens with the Citroen Supreme Novices Hurdle, a cavalry
charge over two miles to find the National Hunt stars of the future, and
a race that the Irish always fancy their chances in every year.
However, for the runners in today's feature race, this is it.
Most, if not all, have been trained or ages with the Champion Hurdle
in mind.
Since they first displayed ability over a hurdle in public, the seed
of expectation has been planted in the minds of connections.
''Is this is a Cheltenham type? Could he be that good? Wouldn't it be
wonderful if . . .'' And if the ability shown is better than average,
then the top hurdle prize, or just to have a go, is seldom far from the
surface.
For most, such dreams disappear in a haze of alcohol in the bars when
reality dawns, but the excitement, the thrill of just being part of it
all, makes the blows less hurtful.
With the added prize fund this year the outcome of the Champion is
anyone's guess, but then what race at this meeting is otherwise?
The Queen Mother is a regular at the Festival, and the two-mile
Champion Chase which bears her name tomorrow is the centre-piece of the
middle afternoon.
Great chasers are on its roll of honour, with the cream of 1995 hoping
to have their name added to that of stars like Remittance Man, Barnbrook
Again, and that brilliant jumper, Pearlyman.
However, as in most walks of life, the best is kept until last, for it
is on the final afternoon, Thursday, that the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the
blue riband of National Hunt racing, is due to be decided.
Most sports have their immortals -- W G Grace, Jesse Owens, Pele, or
Jim Clark -- individuals whose ability made them stand out by miles from
the crowd, and the sport of kings is no different.
Arguments rage about the best Derby winner of all time, of the top
filly to have raced, but so far as the Gold Cup is concerned there was
only one Arkle.
Few within the sport at the time could not marvel at the great one and
his humiliation of England's finest, Mill House, in the Gold Cup of
1964.
The consummate ease with which the Irish chaser simply ran away from
his much-touted rival in the closing stages, leaving Mill House's
jockey, Willie Robinson, shattered, with the hiding that his mount had
just received.
Whether another Arkle will be unearthed this year is rather doubtful,
but great interest and excitement is guaranteed.
French trainer Francois Doumen, winner of the race last year with The
Fellow, again will be represented but perhaps the home side have a few
more aces up their sleeve this time.
So, if you're not lucky enough to be present at the famous West
Country course, arrange to have the three afternoons off, sit back,
relax, and watch the best in National Hunt racing.
The only down-side to this idea is that, as BBC are no longer
televising the Festival, that irritating man with more hair than sense
whom Channel 4 employ in the betting ring will keep popping up from time
to time. But then in life, nothing is perfect.
There is an extra fixture at Cheltenham on Friday but this forms no
part of the Festival meeting.
The bad weather in the earlier part of the season led to the
cancellation of several meetings at Cheltenham, and so Firday's fixture
has been added as a way of compensation.
FESTIVAL FACTS
* ONLY one horse, Dawn Run, has gone on the win the Cheltenham Gold
Cup (1986) after having won the Champion Hurdle (1984). Dual champion
hurdler Night Nurse (1976 and '77) was second in the Gold Cup to his
stable-companion Little Owl in 1981.
* FORMER champion Flat jockey Lester Piggott has a 100% success record
in the Triumph Hurdle. When the race was staged at the now-defunct
course, Hurst Park, Piggott won on his only ride, when 11-4 favourite
Prince Charlemagne bolted home by six lengths.
* CATERERS Letheby &amp; Christopher employ 2000 staff to serve the crowds
at the 116 bars, restaurants, and snack bars at Cheltenham. More than
22,000 meals will be served, plus 10,000 packed lunches for the catering
staff.
* GOLDEN Miller won five consecutive Gold Cups between 1932-36, a
record so far unmatched in turf history. He also became the first horse
to win a Gold Cup and Aintree Grand National in 1934.
* EIGHT horses have won the Champion Hurdle twice -- Insurance,
National Spirit, Bula, Night Nurse, Comedy Of Errors, Monksfield, and
Sea Pigeon. Granville Again is the only horse in today's race bidding to
join this select group.

HIGHLIGHT this afternoon -- and for some the entire meeting -- is the
Champion Hurdle, run over an extended two miles, and this year's race
promises to be extra special.
Reigning champion Flakey Dove won't be going for a double -- she has
been retired -- but the Irish invasion force will be shattered if their
top hope, Danoli, fails to collect. His chances have been increased by
the news that Relkeel is out due to injury.
A leading British hope is Oliver Sherwood's Large Action, a
comfortable winner of his last four races. However, the youngsters this
year may hold the key. As well as Danoli, a winner at the Festival in
1994, Mysilv, successful in last year's Triumph Hurdle and the baby in
the field, is on an attractive each-way mark of 10-1, an the Irish are
having savers on another of their challengers, Fortune and Fame.
But it just could be that this lot will be left to fight out the minor
placings after Alderbrook has flown.
Kim Bailey's runner is a virtual novice but seldom do trainers of
Bailey's standing exude so much joy after a horse has been successful as
the man did after Alderbrook had trotted up last time out.
Bailey was effervescent following that triumph, claiming that the
horse -- a Group winner in France on the Flat will take all the beating
on the big day.
Alderbrook, claims his trainer, is a ''wonderful'' jumper who should
go on improving, and at around 6-1 I, for one, am prepared to back
Bailey's judgment. But do not forget to set the video recorder for this
one.

SCOTTISH produced beef, lamb and salmon is currently taking Paris by
storm as a new marketing strategy backed by the Scottish Tourist Board
and Scottish Enterprise is tested in the French capital.
Paris was chosen as the test-bed for ''Scotland the Brand'' which is
aimed at promoting the international Scottish reputation for quality.
The month-long tourism campaign centres on advertising posters in the
Metro and on the city's buses.
Scottish produce is being promoted in Marks &amp; Spencer's seven stores
in and around Paris and also in two French supermarket chains. The
publicity posters used in the metro campaign are repeated in
participating stores and in restaurants using Scottish beef and lamb.
Aberdeen Angus steak, Scotch lamb and smoked salmon are all on offer
at discount prices and sales have increased by more than 150% on some
lines. Other Scottish products in the promotion include cheddar cheese,
blended and malt whisky, Scotch ale, pancakes, shortbread, oatcakes and
jam.
Marks &amp; Spencer has been sufficiently impressed with the impact of the
Scottish produce to extend the in-store promotion to the middle of next
month -- a two-week bonus for the participants. While the sales surge
will fall off at the end of the promotional period they expect them to
continue some 30% ahead of previous base levels.
Among the backers of the Paris exercise have been the Scotch Quality
Beef and Lamb Association who see the venture as a way of building on
the success of their restaurant-based Scotch Beef Clubs.
Association chairman John McNaughton, who farms near Balquhidder, said
that the beef clubs -- top restaurants which were prepared to feature
Scotch beef -- had proved an excellent way of raising the profile of
Scottish produce throughout Europe. They were never going to produce
high-volume sales, however.
''Now the customer who has enjoyed a memorable restaurant meal can go
out and buy the top-quality ingredients in a local supermarket -- and
that is where we hope to see sales volumes rising steadily,'' he said.
The Scottish promotion was launched in the prestigious Hotel Prince De
Galle -- equivalent to The Ritz in London.
Without causing offence to French sensibilities, the organisers flew
in Alan Hill, the head chef of Gleneagles Hotel, to oversee the
preparation of lunch for about 150 guests, including 80 journalists. The
result was an outstanding success centred around prime Aberdeen Angus
filet steak with Gleneagles' own version of clapshot -- not quite the
way mother used to make it!
With salmon for starters, Dunsyre and Teviotdale cheese following the
main course and, as a finale, ginger caramel custard with Scottish
berries there was no doubt that Alan Hill had justly earned the applause
he got when he eventually took a bow.
George Russell, chairman of the ''Scotland the Brand'' working group,
hailed the Scotland in Paris event as a success. ''By working together
we have transformed a #300,000 tourism advertising campaign into a
platform for promoting Scottish trade in general,'' he said. ''The
formula could be repeated in cities throughout the world with different
Scottish producers -- not just from the food sector -- opting in or out
as seemed sensible to them. By working together tourism and trade can
make a huge impact.''

THE middle afternoon of the Festival often attracts less attention as
punters ready themselves for the climax, the Gold Cup, on Thursday. But
for genuine steeplechasing enthusiasts, there is certainly no sense of
anti-climax on the Wednesday.
The principal race is the Queen Mother Champion Chase and, as its name
implies, it brings together the cream over two miles. Most of the main
contenders have been racing against each other throughout the season, as
well as having met at last year's Festival, and it therefore has the
flavour of a handicap even if they all will be carrying 12st.
Course experience, the expected soft going, and riding plans are
important considerations as well as current form, and comparisons of the
weights. Riding plans became complicated when Oliver Sherwood, principal
employer of Jamie Osborne, named Coulton as a possible runner.
With the availability of Osborne -- Travado's regular partner -- in
doubt, trainer Nicky Henderson moved quickly to fix up Richard Dunwoody,
who is thus set to renew an old acquaintance with the horse.
However, although Coulton is declared for the Champion Chase, Sherwood
is more likely to run him in the Cathcart Chase on Thursday, so Osborne
has been schooling Simon Christian's Nakir, one of the three market
leaders along with Travado and Viking Flagship.
Adrian Maguire partnered Viking Flagship to victory last year but the
Irishman's plans for Cheltenham were thrown in confusion following the
death of his mother. He has dismissed Viking Flagship's disappointing
form this season and is confident that the horse can win again,
especially as he won't be giving any weight away.
Travado also is a Festival winner -- he won the Arkle two years ago
under Osborne -- and another to be given a chance on experience is
Katabatic, the 1991 Champion Chase winner, who has another Cheltenham
victory to his credit.

DICK Vitale is one of the most popular of America's television
basketball commentators. So popular, in fact, that he has become a
celebrity even beyond the bounds of his own sport.
Evidence of that fact came recently when Golf Digest magazine
recruited Vitale to rate the golfing ability of a number of college
coaches. He waxed eloquent about a number of gentlemen, finally
identifying Jim Boeheim, from the University of Syracuse, and
seven-handicapper Nolan Richardson, from the University of Arkansas, as
his selections for the nation's finest.
It wasn't too long afterwards, though, that Vitale's credentials for
making such a selection were brought into question. This is, after all,
is the same man who once swung his club so violently at a golf ball that
he missed and fractured a wrist.
* IN baseball, there are three kinds of batters, those who bat
left-handed, those who bat right-handed, and those who are adept from
both sides.
In media guides, programmes, and on baseball cards, a particular
batter's preference is indicated by the letter R, or L, or the letter B,
for ''both,'' after his name.
Jeff Richardson, a low-level batter with the Pittsburgh Pirates,
recently suggested that the letter B after his name should be replaced
with a D. When asked what a D would signify for a major-league batter,
Richardson replied: ''It's a D as in 'doesn't'.''
* WITH the baseball strike ongoing, a number of teams have resorted to
employing replacement players, much to the consternation of the players'
union. The Pittsburgh Pirates are among the teams taking this option.
One of them wheeled out for a game last week was Jimmy Boudreau, a
pitcher who last appeared in a professional match in 1986. Boudreau
played a nondescript game, prompting Steve Blass, the Pirates' stadium
announcer, to comment: ''He should have been better, pitching on 3195
days' rest.''
* IT is probably a sign of the times, and not a particularly
encouraging one. At a time when baseball is in disarray, when the ice
hockey season has had to be shortened due to contract disputes, and when
sporting icon O J Simpson is on trial for murder, the spotlight is being
deflected to those in the wings.
Just how far into the wings is indicated by the fact that the latest
tell-all biography to hit the book stores is one detailing the life
history of the Barrel Man.
Who? Apparently, he's a big fan of the Denver Broncos football team
who earned a reputation for attending games clad only in a wooden
barrel. Presumably, there's no-one on the team itself interesting enough
to write about.
* AMERICA is the land of opportunity. And, inevitably, there are those
who just can't resist the opportunity to get some promotional mileage
out of the murder trial of O J Simpson.
Unquestionably the most outrageous scheme has been dreamed up by a
radio station in Cincinnati, Ohio. The station has offered Simpson $1m
if, during the closing arguments of his trial, he will wear a T-shirt to
court bearing the station's logo.
Thus far, there has been no response from the Simpson camp, although,
given his mounting legal fees, maybe he should consider it.
* ON the subject of T-shirts, how much would you pay for one? How
about one bearing the logo of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games? How about
the first in a limited-edition series of 500, one of which will be
auctioned for charity every day until the Games begin next year?
The practice began prior to the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway, when
the first shirt was auctioned forl $8665.
Of course, things are bigger and better in the USA. The first of 500
Atlanta Olympic T-shirts was auctioned last week and was bought by
company chairman, Brad Schuman, who paid #26,000.
The money will go towards a fund to allow disadvantaged children in
the Atlanta area to attend the Games. And the shirt is guaranteed not to
shrink after one wash.

THE TSB, which already has a long association with Glasgow, is to
establish its phonebank service in the city's prestigious Atlantic Quay
development, on the north bank of the Clyde. It will provide bank
customers with a wide range of banking services by telephone, over 365
days a year.
It means that Glasgow has firmly established itself as a major player
in call centres, which are regarded as one of the fastest growing areas
of communications.
Call centres are telephone-based operations, where customers telephone
to a central point for information or services. The centres already
employ several thousands of people, with more jobs expected to be
created in the sector.
Glasgow Development Agency, which is the principal agent for the
economic regeneration of the city, has identified this call centre
market as one with ''a significant job-creating potential'', and has
played a central role in helping to attract a number of major
organisations to set up call centre operations in the city. It has also
concentrated on developing appropriate training courses.
The TSB said the new business would be operational by September 5,
giving Scotland its first 24-hour, 365-days-a-year telephone banking
service, fully integrated with an existing bank branch network.
''Staffing at the call centre is expected eventually to reach 950,''
said a spokesman. ''These will be recruited from the Glasgow area.
Phonebank will be available country-wide at local call rates, and
customers will pay no additional charge for the service.
'' The system was introduced by TSB with a call centre in Newport,
South Wales, last year. Glasgow is the second centre to be established
in the UK.
''The bank will be offering its 7,500,000 customers the freedom to
choose the way they do business with it,'' the spokesman added. ''A bank
branch network, fully integrated with a telephone banking service, in
addition to a major network of cash dispensers, offers real convenience
unparalleled by TSB's competitors.''
The GDA pointed out that the quality of the city's pool of labour had
been a major factor in attracting a number of large call centre
developments. A major strategic thrust of the GDA was to improve and
enhance the skills of the city's workforce, both of those in employment
and those wanting to enter the labour market.
''As a result of the sheer scale of the recruitment involved in the
TSB development, and because of the substantial growth in the call
centre sector in the city as a whole, our training agency division, in
conjunction with a number of experienced training providers, has
developed a programme of access courses, aimed specifically at the
long-term unemployed, which will give individuals the opportunity to
update and re-define their skills to allow them to compete for jobs in
the growing call centre market,'' said a spokesman.
The courses last between six and eight weeks and cover communication
skills, telephone skills/telesales, presentation skills/ business dress
standards/ the banking environment, keyboard skills, customer service
care, confidence building, candidate interview skills, and
social/interpersonal skills.
Denise Kerins, GDA's executive responsible for the access course
programmes, stressed that they would enable people to compete for jobs
in any call centre environment, providing them with a range of skills
which would be transferable from one centre operation to another.
''We recognise that many of the jobs created by the TSB's inward
investment in the city, will be filled by those who already have
experience in call centre operations,'' she said. ''However, there will
be opportunities for some long-term unemployed people, who have gained
the necessary skills through the courses, to compete more effectively
for employment in the new call centre.''
With a number of new TSB jobs expected to be be taken by people
already working within the call centre sector, the expectation is that
secondary vacancies will be created as a result.
''It is vitally important for people to realise that the skills being
taught during these access courses are transferable, and can be used in
any call centre environment,'' she added.
''To qualify for the access courses, which are funded by our training
for work programme, an individual must be 18 years of age or over, and
be in any one of a number of categories. These include having been
registered unemployed for six months or more, having a disability, being
a returner to the labour market after a minimum break of two years, or
being involved in what we have assessed as a large-scale redundancy.''
Other categories can quality an individual for entry to the courses.
Anyone wishing to establish qualification is advised to get in touch
with a local training provider involved in the delivery of the courses,
or with a job centre, for advice and guidance.
GDA Director of Training, Willie Fortucci, said it was vitally
important for the economy of Glasgow that the skills base of its
workforce should be raised, and particularly in areas which were market
driven.
''The call centre industry is now a major employer in the city,'' he
pointed out. ''Firms have been attracted here by the quality of the
workforce. We have to ensure that there is an even greater pool of
people capable of taking up employment in this rapidly growing sector.
''By offering training packages which are specifically tailored to
providing people with the necessary skills, we hope to be able to
increase that pool, and thereby make Glasgow even more attractive as a
call centre location to firms which are seeking to establish or to
expand their operations.''

SCOTTISH dairy farming may be the next sector to be asked to
participate in a farm-assured quality scheme -- taking their place
alongside livestock producers, cereal farmers and pig farmers.
A draft scheme has already been drawn up by the Scottish Agricultural
College, with Scottish Office funding, and the big question to be
decided now is when it will be launched. ''We are not at that stage
yet,'' said Mr Alex Brown -- former convener of the National Farmers'
Union of Scotland milk committee -- who is chairman of the group which
has been working on the proposed scheme for the past 18 months.
Mr Brown said yesterday that discussions would still have to be held
with processors and purchasers before the final details could be
unveiled.
The pressure for quality assurance was coming from the supermarket
sector which was showing increasing interest in how the goods it sold
over the counter were produced at farm level, he said. At present
welfare issues were high on the list of customer concerns.
The quality of milk produced in Scotland was currently very high, said
Mr Brown. However, the farm-assured scheme would also look at the whole
range of systems in which dairy cows were kept. He did not envisage that
major changes on welfare grounds would be required on any of the systems
used by Scottish farmers.
The equivalent scheme in the livestock sector has not yet made a major
impact but Mr Brown said his hope was that all 2300 dairy farmers in
Scotland would want to be part of the new milk scheme once it was off
the ground. ''Scottish dairy farmers are already licensed and registered
to produce milk -- and they are producing milk of the highest possible
standard,'' he said. ''We may have a job on our hands convincing them
that they should join this new scheme but farmers should realise that
quality assurance is not about another 1p or 2p on the litre. It is
about guaranteeing your place in the market. There is no doubt in may
mind that the big supermarkets are going to be applying pressure for us
to deliver quality assurance.''

EVEN after the fine imposed on it by the European Commission, cement
producer Rugby Group had a good year in 1994 and is confident for 1995.
The Commission fined Rugby #3.9m for allegedly participating in a
cartel with other European cement producers. Rugby is appealing against
the Commission's findings in so far as they affect it.
Another hit was a higher-than-expected loss of #3.1m on disposal of
the group's metal products business in France.
Despite these factors, Rugby's profits still rose 19% to #76.1m on the
back of a one-third increase in sales to #1010m. Demand improved as a
result of increased housebuilding activity, higher infrastructure
spending and more industrial building.
The final dividend of 2.1p makes a total of 3.6p against 3.385p.
The UK cement market faded somewhat in the second half and Rugby's
operating profits from this source slipped slightly to #16.8m. The
Australian cement contribution was ahead at #15.3m.
Cement is just one arm of Rugby, with joinery products now a larger
activity, particularly in America where Rugby has built a major position
through acquisition. As a result the US contribution more than doubled
to #8m.
The purchase of Bunzl Building Supplies increased Rugby's presence in
the American joinery products industry and enhanced its buying power and
geographical spread. It will now be more able to sell to the big DIY
sheds in the US.
John Carr, the UK joinery side, managed a small rise to #18.2m but
competition hotted up as Spring Ram entered the market. Europe achieved
#9.6m, almost twice the 1993 figure after the integration of
acquisitions in Holland.
Finally, metal products in the UK, which makes metal building products
used in construction like steel reinforcement bars and claddings, made
#6.9m against #3.9m.
Rugby reckons competition will remain strong this year when
housebuilding will be pretty flat. But chairman Geoffrey Higham sees
further progress for the group in 1995.
Rugby shares slipped 1p to 109p where they yield 4.1% and sell at 13
times earnings.

TAKARE, Britain's largest nursing home operator, continues to grow
strongly.
Profits before tax jumped 41.2% to #21.1m, in line with City
estimates. However, earnings per share growth was held back by the
rights issue in 1993 but the dividend was raised 11.1% to 2.3p after a
final payment of 1.5p.
The number of beds in operation increased by 23% to 6570. Among the
new developments commissioned last year was a 90-bed home in Ailsa
Craig, Glasgow. The company is confident that it will not suffer any ill
effects from the recent screening of a hostile ''Dispatches''
documentary on one of the company's homes in South-east England.
Describing the programme as ''heavily misleading'', managing director
Hamilton Anstead said that if half the allegations were correct then
''we'd have been rumbled ages ago''.
The popularity of Takare homes is not in any doubt. Last year, it
achieved an average of 97% occupancy although in line with other nursing
home operators it experienced a slight reduction in occupancy in the
first quarter as social security budgets came under pressure.
Commenting on the results, chairman Keith Bradshaw said that nearly
two years into the Community Care reforms the company's occupancy
remains at a level unique within the sector, ''indicating that we have a
product that people both want and can afford''.
Just under a quarter of Takare's beds are subject to long-term NHS
contracts, one of the biggest contracts is with the Greater Glasgow
Health Board.
The company is in a strong financial position following its rights
issue in 1993. Gearing stands at 14.4%. It has #23m cash and #80m of
unutilised bank facilities. Therefore Mr Anstead said there would be no
need to come back to shareholders in the foreseeable future. Given the
projected expansion in the years ahead gearing could rise to a peak of
85% before subsiding.
Edinburgh and London remain target areas for expansion given Takare's
poor representation in these parts of the UK. Just over half, 53%, of
its 1980 new beds will be in these two cities but because land values
are so high Takare is having to build two-storey homes to make them
economically viable at the relatively low fee rates which it charges. Mr
Anstead said the group was committed to allowing open access to
everybody.
Expansion into South-east England should enable Takare to push up its
operating margins which were unchanged last year at 23.7%. Above-average
growth in earnings per share (in the mid to high teens range) beyond
1995 augurs well for the shares which yesterday gained 4p to 200p in
response to the trading statement.

SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi has lured back Jennifer Laing, one of its former
stars, to run the London branch of its global network.
The London agency, known in the industry as ''Charlotte Street'' after
its headquarter's address, was left rudderless when former boss David
Kershaw resigned in January. He left in sympathy after Maurice Saatchi
was fired as group chairman in December.
The group is buying Jennifer Laing's company, Laing Henry, for #1.2m.
It said it would settle up in shares with the price based on the average
Saatchi share price in the five dealing days before completion. The
acquisition is expected to be completed on March 31.
''This is a significant development for the agency,'' said group chief
executive Charlie Scott.
''Jennifer Laing was a major force behind the success of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising for 17 years before leaving to run her own very
successful agency. She is tremendously respected for her advertising
skills and business acumen. We are delighted to have attracted her back
to such a key position.''
Saatchi shares, which have been lurking around their lowest-ever
levels, were 86p ahead of results for the group due this morning. Media
analysts expect pre-tax profits of between #30m and #32m.
Saatchi said it would have to issue 1.4 million shares for the buy,
assuming an issue price of 86p, and up to an extra 441,000 in ''certain
circumstances'' which it did not clarify.
Laing Henry had revenues in 1994 of #2.6m and pre-tax profit of
#980,000. Major clients include the Central Office of Information, the
Health Education Authority and London's police force.
Saatchi plans to change its holding company name to Cordiant at an
extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Thursday to avoid confusion with
its Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide network. SSAW is one of its
two main networks and the London agency has a strong reputation in
Britain for creative flair.
Maurice Saatchi is setting up a rival new advertising agency and has
lured some former Saatchi &amp; Saatchi clients. He will be joined by some
former executives, including David Kershaw, when they are free from
their contractual obligations to Saatchi.

EDINBURGH-based CALA yesterday reported a near-500% increase in
interim pre-tax profits, in spite of the fragile state of the housing
market.
A modest improvement in trading and the lower cost of land were behind
the surge in profits from #337,000 to #1.98m in the six months to
December, although a #275,000 exceptional gain on the sale of the
housebuilder's head office also helped.
The previous year's halfway figure was reduced by #299,000 worth of
reorganisation charges and cost containment was another positive factor
in the latest figures.
CALA raised its interim dividend by 22% to 1.10p and, although the
results were well ahead of expectations, its shares put on only 2p to
106p. The City seems reluctant to give companies in the sector the
benefit of the doubt, whatever the figures.
The Scottish housebuilding operation was the engine which drove
profits upwards, with 114 units sold at an average price of #135,000,
compared with 73 sales at an average of #154,000 in the previous first
half.
In England, 161 units were sold at an average price of #102,000, after
145 sales at an average of #110,000 last time.
The sales mix was behind the drop in price. CALA chairman Geoffrey
Ball said the company was generally driving the average price up and
that this would be reflected in full-year results.
Margins were higher because CALA was developing on cheaper land bought
about two years ago, before the recent rise in Scottish land prices.
Turnover was up just 13% at #33.9m.
Edinburgh-based broker Bell Lawrie White is forecasting full-year
profits of more than #6m, an increase of at least 60% on the previous
year's figure of #3.76m. If achieved, this would be CALA's best result
since 1989.
Mr Ball said: ''Trading has been a little bit better than last year. I
think, slowly but surely, we are getting the company back to where it
was.''
With a lack of consumer confidence hitting the housing market, Mr Ball
added: ''We would expect there to be very modest increases in volumes
and little upside in prices.''
CALA, which forecasts house price inflation of between 2% and 3%,
believes next month's cut in mortgage interest tax relief could cause a
temporary hiccup.
Taking a cautious stance, it is not banking on a tax cut in November's
Budget, which would almost certainly boost the market.
Profits from the Exchange Plaza development in Edinburgh, a 200,000 sq
ft joint venture between CALA and Edinburgh-based construction group
Morrison, are expected to begin flowing in the second half.
CALA has used some of the proceeds from last spring's #7m rights issue
to expand its English landbank.

BRITISH Polythene Industries yesterday announced a #2m investment in a
Dumfries factory which will recycle waste polythene from farms.
The Greenock-based group, which is the largest polythene packaging
company in Europe, has purchased the older of two buildings on a site at
College Milton from Swiss confectionery giant Nestle.
Learning from the experience of its Anaplast subsidiary at Ardeer in
Ayrshire, British Polythene will install equipment to wash some of the
50,000-plus tonnes of waste agricultural film produced in the UK each
year, much of it the black wrapping from silage bales.
British Polythene anticipates an annual output from the Dumfries
factory of between 5000 and 7000 tonnes of Plaswood, a plastic lumber
product used for fence posts, external furniture and retaining sections
of waterways.
The revamped factory, scheduled to open in the autumn, is expected to
create between 40 and 50 jobs by the end of next year.
With minimal input costs, British Polythene hopes to boost annual
turnover by between #2m and #3m, while extending its policy of recycling
polythene scrap collected from customers.
Cameron McLatchie, executive chairman of British Polythene, said: ''We
are spending a lot of money in this recycling area in Scotland.
Last week, British Polythene announced a 25% increase in full-year
profits to #19.2m.

A BETTER-than-expected performance from Baker's Oven enabled Greggs to
report annual profits well ahead of City expectations at #12m before
tax. This pushed up the shares 50p to 1118p.
Baker's Oven was loss-making before it was acquired by Greggs but the
lower cost structure and stock mix at Greggs has enabled it to be turned
round and it made an operating profit of #1.9m.
The acquisition boosted Gregg's retail chain to 930 shops. There was
underlying sales growth in Greggs of 1%. Its sales of bread and rolls
continued to be affected by the availability of cut-price alternatives
but there was good demand for its sandwiches and savoury products.
During the year 20 Greggs shops were opened. Nine of the 424 Baker's
Oven outlets acquired were closed in the year with a few others also
likely to close. Despite the acquisition and record capital expenditure
of #15m, Greggs remains in a strong financial position with net debt of
only #600,000 at the year-end.
The larger-than-expected 27.8% rise in the total dividend to 23p had
City analysts scurrying to upgrade their 1995 profit forecasts.

PERSIMMON chairman Duncan Davidson is perplexed. Britain's
seventh-biggest housebuilder duly delivered good 1994 profits yesterday,
up 35% to #25.2m, and since the beginning of February has increased
sales by 20% -- way above the industry average.
Yet the shares at 173p, which in recent months have underperformed the
market by 18%, are just slightly in excess of the net asset value of
169p which in itself may be understated given the firming of land prices
over the last year or so.
There was no contribution in 1994 from the sale of ACT tax shelter
subsidiaries to FTSE companies which brought in #2.36m in 1993. It had
been hoped there would have been a #2.8m contribution but that has been
delayed because of on-going discussions with the Inland Revenue.
So on a truly comparable basis, housebuilding profits actually leapt
55%.
An extra 14% of new houses were sold, raising the total to 3165 with
the target this year put at 4000. That is despite a planned reduction in
social housing from 440 to 250 units as Government assistance to the
housing associations is cut back.
The increase in build is partly because of an extra 20 new sites
coming on stream, including the first in Aberdeen. Persimmon has also
sold 40 houses in Milton Keynes to Hong Kong Chinese, surely one of the
less predictable of bolt holes whose only notable claim to fame remains
the concrete cows by the railway.
Average prices rose 7% to just over #65,000 -- those in Scotland
averaged #78,625 with sales in the greater Glasgow area proving better
than those in the Edinburgh region. Mr Davidson is hoping for average
profits to rise from #8000 to about #10,000 per unit in 1995, helped by
almost all the land bought in the late 1980s now being developed.
Some #80m was spent on 5000 plots last year to leave the land bank at
just over four years' planned production with gearing comfortable at
15%.
Possibly part of the share weakness is because of the #49m rights
issue a year ago at 282p which may have been seen as opportunist.
Profits should improve to about #32m which would leave the shares
trading at nine times likely earnings. The dividend total has been
raised by 5.6% to 9.5p, covered over 1.6 times by earnings, for a sound
6.9% yield.
Despite his confidence for the current year with a 50% upsurge in site
visitor numbers, Mr Davidson will just have to wait until his sector is
re-rated.

LORD Hollick's media and money broking group MAI has done better than
expected in its first half to December 31 as its media interests --
including in particular the Anglia TV acquisition -- more than made up
the slack in money broking.
Overall, pre-tax profits emerge up 22%, from #48.2m to #58.6m on a 27%
increase in turnover to #396m.
At the trading level ahead of tax and interest profits of the media
activities surged from #5.6m to #28.7m. This incorporated a full six
months from Anglia, bought in March last year.
Over the same period, low volumes in the financial markets caused a
sharp reduction in money and securities broking profits from an
exceptional #28m in the previous period to #16m.
Elsewhere, the information division, taking in NOP, advanced from
#4.9m to #6.1m. The interim dividend is held at 2p.
Market satisfaction with MAI's performance was reflected in a 7p rise
in the share price to 236p. From managing director Lord Hollick's
viewpoint, the good performance by Anglia must be a real cause of
satisfaction since at the time of buying the purchase price of #292m was
thought in some City quarters to be too high though the publicity
swiftly shifted to the controversy over Lord Archer's share dealing
orders.
Aside from Anglia, where the group has completed its rationalisation
programme, cutting costs by #7m, MAI's 61%-owned Meridian TV also did
well.

STERLING scored all round the wicket yesterday afternoon following a
weekend relapse when it posted fresh lows against the Deutschmark and
the yen.
Slightly better-than-expected producer price figures were overshadowed
by volatile trading in the pound which was left nursing the bulk of its
recent losses.
It had fallen sharply against both the dollar and the mark on Friday
afternoon for no discernible reason, except that it is often friendless
on foreign exchange markets where the mark and the yen are on the
rampage.
In New York trading on Friday night it fell below DM2.22, and its
decline continued in Tokyo early yesterday when it dropped to 142.55 yen
and DM2.2155. City analysts were sceptical that the latest bout of
weakness could be blamed on the unexpectedly large visible trade deficit
for December, revealed on Friday.
The pound had in fact ridden out the trade figures for 4[1/2] hours
before it began to nosedive and then lost 0.8% of its trade-weighted
index between 2pm and 4pm.
Yesterday morning as European markets were opening up for business the
Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, visiting Basle for a
meeting of the Group of 10 central bank governors, said the pound had
had ''a wobble downwards. I hope it will perk up.''
For the rest of the morning sterling continued to look jaded, though
it traded above its Far Eastern lows. In the afternoon it perked up and
ended the day at DM2.2486, 1.63 pfennigs above Friday night's close, and
$1.5969, 1.52 cents higher.
Its trade-weighted index, calculated at 4pm, gained 0.2 to 85.3 after
opening at 84.7. So far this year this measure of the pound's
international worth has dropped by about 3.6%.
Against the dollar sterling has in fact gained nearly three cents over
the period, but it has lost nearly 18 pfennigs against the mark.
The bulk of sterling's decline is a by-product of the dollar's
malaise. But there is also evidence that the Government's political and
economic difficulties have contributed to the pound's fall from grace.
Part of the problem is that the Federal Reserve has no compelling
reason to bolster the dollar against the yen and the mark by
intervention on the foreign exchange markets or an increase in American
interest rates.
The US now does 30% of its trade with its two partners, Canada and
Mexico, in the North American Free Trade Area. The dollar has been
gaining ground on the devalued Mexican peso (hardly a surprise) and the
Canadian dollar.
James Capel's chief economist, Keith Skeoch, has adjusted the dollar's
official trade-weighted index to take account of changes in the flow of
trade over the last five years. His research suggests that the dollar
has actually gained 1% in the last year and has remained firm since the
start of this year.
The pound is likely to remain on weak ground against European
currencies for as long as the dollar is out of favour on the Continent.
The last thing Britain needs is an easing of monetary policy through the
exchange rate. The drop in the trade-weighted index so far this year is
equal to a fall of nearly 1% in base rates.
Booming exports to the rest of the EU will boom even more. Sectors of
manufacturing industry will hit capacity constraints and this will put
pressure on both domestic and overseas prices.
February's producer prices were a reminder that factory gate inflation
is still escalating. The main measure of output price inflation rose by
0.3% in February after a revised increase of 1% (0.9%) in January. As a
result the annual rate edged up from 3.5% (3.4%) to 3.6%.
There are more worrying indications in the seasonally-adjusted index
which excludes the food, drink, tobacco and petroleum industries.
This measure of factory gate price inflation increased by 0.3% in
February after a gain of 0.5% in January. The annual rate moved up from
3.5% to 3.7%, but the three-month on three-month rate was unchanged at
5.1%.
Capel's Adam Cole said: ''Leading indicators of factory gate prices,
particularly from the CBI, are still showing considerable inflationary
pressure in the pipeline that has yet to work its way through.''
Manufacturers continue to be plagued by increases in material and fuel
costs. Input prices rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.2% in February to
give an annual rate of 11.4%. The sting was in the revisions. The
January increase was restated at 1.7% against the provisional 1.3%. The
annual rate was revised from 11.5% to 12.1%.
Average earnings figures for January, due tomorrow, are widely
forecast to post an increase in the growth rate from 3.75% to 4%, and
this could signal a fresh twist in the inflationary spiral.
Another hike in base rates is being forecast to take place next month
or in May. Earlier rises were dictated by the pace of activity. Next
time round genuine inflationary pressures are more likely to be the
precursor.

Dick Dale, inventor of surf music, is riding the crest once more
WHAT Glasgow's known for ages, Quentin Tarantino discovers eventually.
Tarantino described Dick Dale's inimitable guitar playing as ''the good,
the bad and the ugly all rolled into one''. Then Hollywood's hottest
young director deployed one of the veteran axe-man's visceral
30-year-old tunes, Miserlou, on the soundtrack of his cult hit movie
Pulp Fiction, providing Dale's long-dormant career with a further fillip
and proving simultaneously that the music business is often stranger
than any type of fiction.
For it was not until 1993 that the 57-year-old inventor of the
surf-music genre -- later popularised by the Surfaris, Jan and Dean,
and, of course, the Beach Boys -- had played outside his native
California. Recently it was announced that he will be visiting London
later this month for his first shows outside the US.
And now it can be told that Dick Dale and his three-piece band will be
playing two shows in Scotland, having turned down gigs in Switzerland in
order to appear at Glasgow's Garage on March 31, and Edinburgh's Music
Box (April 1).
Fittingly, support in both cases will be provided by those swinging
kings of the Strathbungo surf, the Beat Poets, the band who owe their
existence to Dick Dale, and who have proselytised on his behalf
throughout their nine-year existence.
''Dick Dale had long been an idol, and one night he appeared to me in
a dream, handing me his trademark gold guitar and telling me to form the
Beat Poets,'' says head BP Tom Rafferty. Don't risk nightmares: secure
your Dick Dale tickets soonliest.

ALBION Automotive, the Glasgow axle works rescued from receivership 16
months ago, has gone into profit two years ahead of schedule because of
a burgeoning order book.
Turnover is up from #30m to #50m and the company now employs 430
workers in Glasgow after dropping to under 300 when it was bailed out.
Recent orders total over #100m and Albion's new range of axles and
crankshafts is receiving widespread interest. If growth continues as
planned, the company could be employing over 1000 workers at Glasgow and
Lancashire by the end of the decade. There are about 320 at the
Lancashire plant.
A significant breakthrough was a recent #25m order from Perkins
Engines, one of the world's leading truck manufacturers, for
crankshafts. The kudos earned from supplying a blue-chip company like
Perkins means other manufacturers will feel more confident dealing with
a company which less than two years ago could have gone out of
existence.
Albion Automotive was originally the axle works of British Leyland,
which eventually became Leyland DAF. When Leyland DAF went into
receivership, Scottish Enterprise and the Glasgow Development Agency
helped draw up a rescue package to ensure the Albion works continued.
One obvious difficulty was that the works was not a free-standing
business, and design, marketing and sales departments all had to be
added. The remaining staff had also to agree to a 5% wage cut in order
to make the rescue package viable.
Shortly after it was formed, Albion Automotive took over the Leyland
division in Lancashire which produced compatable components such as
gears and and was tooled up to make crankshafts.
Meanwhile, the company began working on a range of axles which were
lighter, yet stronger than the old ones, offering trucks and vans a
bigger payload with fewer components.
Fortunately, the launch of Albion Automotive has coincided with
changes in the automobile manufacturing sector, where companies are
increasingly willing to sub-contract work, so that the interest in
Albion's axles, brakes and crankshafts is growing. More than 34,000
axles a year are now being built.
Albion chief executive Dan Wright said the automobile industry had
climbed out of the recession and the market place was there for them.
More than #30m is spent by the company buying in components, and about a
third of that comes from abroad.

Mary Brennan meets the mentor with a mission to develop new
generations of choreographers.
PETER BONEHAM does not look like God. Or Moses. True, he has a wee
white beard and a voice that can edge from soft and thoughtful to full
command mode in the same breath. But, dressed casually in loose navy, he
does not look like a prophet, or an international guru. And that's
because Peter Boneham has no time for puffed-up images, in life -- or in
dance.
''Steps for steps,'' he'll say, watching some choreographer run
through a developing section of work. ''That's just steps for the sake
of it. What's that flip in there for? What is it you want to do? You
want to go straight into sitting, there? Do it! Just go ahead -- that's
it.'' And it is. The sequence now has a pithier energy, a sense of
purpose.
The choreographer -- one of a group currently working with Boneham as
part of New Moves Across Europe -- looks almost surprised by what has
clicked into place. Boneham makes one or two comments about another
section. He floats suggestions in the form of questions, uses his
observations to trigger off new dialogues inside the dance-maker's head.
The answers, the choreography itself, have to reflect the individual.
Boneham is now 60; an American who relocated to Canada, and is now
mentor to new generations of choreographic talent world-wide. Ten years
ago, his board in Ottawa wanted to sack him. Funders were disappearing
in a flurry of cancelled cheques. Even some close friends, like Jean
Pierre Perrault, were voicing misgivings and concern. Boneham had
decided to alter the nature of the dance company he ran.
Le Groupe de la Place Royale would no longer tour, or maintain a
repertory of work (his own choreography included) or even be a fixed
troupe of dancers. Instead, as Le Groupe Dance Lab, the company would
function as a test-pad for the development of new dance forms and the
nurturing of new ideas. Choreographers would be free to experiment
within a structure that offered such welcome resources as trained
professional dancers and experienced advisers. This was an unheard of
initiative, not just within Canada.
The aim was focused creativity. Now this didn't mean the production of
finished pieces, or a choreograph-by-numbers process. It meant
channelling individual energies away from the routine mimicry of
existing work. It involved the junking of conventions that didn't hold
any inspiration for the choreographer. It meant finding ways of moving
that expressed what that choreographer felt the dance should convey. It
was, essentially, about honesty and about the falsity of playing safe.
And it was about each choreographer finding that out for him or herself.
What made Boneham upset the applecart -- and the board of his company?
He recalls a competition, back in the eighties, where he was struck by
the dearth of Canadian choreographers, let alone good Canadian
choreographers. But then, as he says, where was there for them to learn?
And it wasn't just Canada lagging behind. Where was there, anywhere, for
choreographers to learn?
He's not talking about classes in technique, or sessions spent
grappling with concepts of canonic structure. He's talking about how an
artist acquires the confidence, and the insight, needed to make work
that is true to their own being. He grins as he recollects Jean Pierre
Perrault's initial reactions to the scheme. (Perrault's own company was
a highlight of last year's Edinburgh Festival dance programme). ''He
wanted to know,'' says Boneham, ''if I was going to make all these bad
choreographers into better bad choreographers!''
He has, in fact, helped dozens of very fine choreographers -- inside
and outside Canada -- realise their own strengths and goals. And maybe
he's helped one or two indifferent talents towards a stage where they
can engage an audience, offer them something more meaningful than
self-indulgent display.
A heart attack five years ago brought home to him just how much his
whole life had been taken over by the work at Dance Lab. He's been so
busy acting as teacher to others -- usually in intensive one-to-one,
three-week stints culminating in a public presentation of
work-in-progress -- that other things, including his own choreography,
have slipped off the map.
Yet, here he is, putting time and energy into being at New Moves --
''I so admire your Nikki Milican. What she does, the artists she
supports''. He's teaching daily class and acting as mentor to four
Scottish choreographers: Tristan Borrer, Alan Greig, Andy Howitt, and
Frank McConnel. ''Mentor. You know I don't really like that term. I'd
rather be seen as some kind of third eye, or maybe a guide. It's not a
case of telling people what to do. More about helping them to find their
own way.'' Would that Peter Boneham could find his way to Scotland,
permanently. We could do with even a soupcon of what he has achieved in
Canada with his visionary initiative at Dance Lab.
* Gut Reactions -- works in progress by the choreographers who have
worked with Peter Boneham -- can be seen at Tramway on March 18.

SCARLET Theatre have certainly come a long way since they were once
known as a rather eccentric feminist theatre company, Scarlet Harlets,
in 1981. Over the years, their work has become more refined while losing
none of their commitment to collaborative working and exploring the
physical, textured sides of theatre.
At last, that investment has paid off. The Sisters directed and
adapted (mainly) from Chekhov's Three Sisters by Polish director
Katarzyna Deszcz and adaptor Andrzej Sadowski and performed by a cast of
five is their most accomplished piece yet.
Tantalisingly spare yet made quintessentially theatrical by the beady,
spectral face of Linda Kerr Scott and Nigel Piper's sparky carousel
influences music, Deszcz, designer Sophia Lovell-Smith and the cast --
Helen Anderson, Grainne Byrne, Emma Bernard and Jan Pearson -- create a
haunting hour's distillation that is as invigorating as it is
unsentimental.
I can't remember seeing a Scarlet production that had such control
over its material or performances of such concentrated emotion.
Under darkened shadows and shrouded spotlights, the three sisters --
Masha, Olga and Irina -- perform ritualised movement. Masha restlessly
paces backwards and forwards; Olga obsessively scrutinises her hands;
Irana lets out hollow little laughs while Natasha, the intrusive sister
in law, insinuates herself then emerges triumphant.
Harrowing yet ironic in its simplicity, these are women deserted by
men, trapped forever behind domestic window panes.
And when Bernard's Irana, sending the overhead lights drunkenly
swaying, explodes with: ''I can't do this any more; I'm only 23 and my
life is slipping away,'' the frisson of hope we have for them is
twin-edged -- that they may escape the confines of their lives both as
characters and as actresses.

EXCLUSIVE
THE man behind Toffolo Jackson, the Glasgow-based terrazzo and marble
specialist which went into receivership in January, has bounced back.
Randolf Laing, whose family founded the well-regarded specialist firm,
is joining forces with Stirling Stone, to create a brand-new venture to
be called Toffolo Stirling.
The development comes after Stirling's managing director, Harry
Turnbull, failed in a bid to buy some of the assets and the company name
from Toffolo Jackson's receivers, Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Instead, Toffolo Jackson has been sold to a London-based stone firm,
Arvin, which apparently bid for the entire assets of the Glasgow-based
business. Stirling wanted only some marble-cutting equipment and the
name.
The name of the brand new venture, Toffolo Stirling, the first part
being the surname of Mr Laing's maternal grandfather, has been
registered. The new venture, the sixth division within the Stirling
Stone Group, will concentrate on non-standard panels in marble, granite
and slate for use in domestic and commercial settings.
Stirling, which is based in Stirling, was started from scratch just
over seven years ago by Mr Turnbull and three colleagues. It has become
a major player in the supply and installation of natural stone cladding
in new buildings and in restoration work.
It has a UK-wide exposure and claims to be one of the three or four
main players in the London market, where one of its first big
breakthroughs was limestone cladding for the Lutyens House development,
a headquarters for BP.
Toffolo Stirling will also be targeting the whole UK market. Mr Laing
said he is hopeful that the receivership of the original Toffolo Jackson
will still result in creditors being paid most, if not all, of the money
they are owed.

The Glasgow festival goes back to its roots with 'people's programme'.
Could this be the year when Mayfest finally shrugs the chip off its
shoulder, from its roots, and success, as a socialist-sponsored fair for
the folk? The annual festival quickly developed pretentions to become a
vital fixture on the international arts agenda, hosting top-class world
premiers and featuring high-calibre artists.
But when it voluntarily invited comparisons to the Edinburgh
International Festival it inevitably seemed like an inferior version,
and worse, lost both its identity and audiences, becoming increasingly
dependent on television comics to draw some of its biggest crowds.
This year, Mayfest's new artistic director Paul Bassett, who inherited
a #100,000 deficit, seems determined to make a virtue out of pulling in
the weans and has pulled out the stops to ensure that Mayfest '95 will
have broader appeal.
''We've tried to get away from the concept of an 'arty' festival, and
ensure that there are more popular events and that is genuinely a
festival of the people,'' he says, as he unveiled further details of the
theatre programme.
So there will be Lepage and French comedy but the emphasis is more on
home-grown culture and works by the likes of Liz Lochhead and Billy
Connolly. ''We have encouraged a Liz presence wherever possible,''
smiles Bassett, only half-jokingly, recognising the natural asset in
Scotland's vivacious grande dame of letters.
Thus, Lochhead is represented in ''Quadruple Guise''. TAG will be
producing her play The Magic Island, as part of a children's drama
programme at the Mitchell Theatre and the GFT will be screening her
Tartan Short film Latin in a Dark Room. Lochhead will also be appearing
in her West of Scotland translation of Tartuffe, which she is also
directing at the Tron, and in a late-night cabaret show at the same
venue, In Flagrant Delicht, where she teams up with Michael Marra to
realise a long-nurtured collaboration.
Bassett is particularly enthusiastic about Lochhead's Tartuffe,
previously seen at the Gilded Balloon during the festival and at the
Royal Lyceum. ''It's brilliant, it's the Broons, it's Moliere at your
aunties. It's just such a strong piece -- the idea that everyone can be
duped by a stranger, whether it's a double-glazing salesman or a
priest.''
While Lochhead will be a colourful and bankable presence, the Big Yin
will be appearing in spirit, not in flesh, with Borderline staging a
double bill of his plays, An Me Wi A Bad Leg Tae and When Hair Was Long
and Time Was Short at the Pavilion. It's rare programming for the venue
which seldom stages drama and is the result of intense discussions
between Bassett and the Pavilion's manager Ian Gordon.
International input is still there, courtesy of the previously
announced production of Robert Lepage's Needles and Opium at the King's,
a Scottish debut for the Abbey Theatre from Dublin's production of
Marina Carr's award-winning new Irish play The Mai at the Tron, GOSH, a
Berlin Circus theatre group at the Tramway and two French productions,
spotted by Bassett at the Avignon Arts Festival.
''Cartoon Sardines Theatre are doing Le Malade Imagine at Cottier
Theatre which is just the Marx Brothers meets Moliere,'' enthuses
Bassett. ''And Theatre Du Kronope are doing Notre-Dame de Paris at the
Tron which is a big, bold 'the bells, the bells'. Again, it's very
comedic and not introspective theatre, and hopefully easy to pitch
because everyone knows the Charles Laughton film.''
The programme might lack the sexy big names of previous Mayfests, but
it is still packed with premieres from Scottish companies. The most
eagerly awaited of these is the Traverse's production of The Collection,
which debuts at the Tron and is penned by Mike Cullen.
Other interesting new works include The Climbing Boy by Carl
MacDougall, with Ian Wooldridge directing Castlemilk People's Theatre,
Child-Lover by the adventurous Theatre Cryptic at the Tramway in a
Scottish-Quebecois production scripted by award winning author Michele
Roberts and the final piece in Cat. A. Theatre Company's prison trilogy,
Doing Bird, looking at life for women prisoners.
Alongside such new works are welcome return visits for successful
productions like the Arches Theatre Company's The Crucible and a gem
from the Ramshorn New Playwrights Initiative, On A Stone Bridge, also at
the Arches.
The indefatigable Andy Arnold has orchestrated a packed programme for
that venue, with himself and Andrew Dallmeyer on stage in the main
theatre for Chekhov's absurd comedies The Bear, The Proposal and The
Wedding and supplemented by appearances from some of the cast from The
Crucible next door, who will have to meet breakneck cues.
While most of this is straightfoward stuff, Bassett has still
incorporated the esoteric, notably in the shape of the remarkable Toby
Gough's Theatrum Botanicum who will be performing the widely imaginative
and enchanting Linnaeus, Prince of Flowers at the Botanic Gardens off
Byres Road. The production was previously a smash hit at the Edinburgh
Festival, in the capital's Royal Botanic Gardens but Basset is
nonchalant about this.
''Well, Gough is doing a Glaswegian version -- if it's possible to do
a Glaswegian version of a drama about a Swiss botanist -- but I've
really no problems with the idea of something having been in Edinburgh
before,'' he shruggs happily to the sound of chips crashing to the
floor.

SUNDAY night's concert by jazz guitarist and vocalist Marty Grosz was
a rare treat. Not just because he hasn't played in Scotland for two
years, but also because even when he does, he's usually constrained by
the presence of other musicians who aren't au fait with his deliberately
off-the-beaten-track repertoire.
On Sunday, however, Grosz was in familiar company -- ''Lord Lucan on
drums; Amelia Earhart on piano and Jimmy Hoffa on bass'' -- and so was
able to whiz through a generous helping of obscure, or seldom-played,
tunes; all accompanied by informative, and hilarious, anecdotes which
are as much a part of a Grosz gig as the music itself.
Just about every number was a highlight. From the 1933, Dick
McDonough-penned, tune about newspaper columnists -- '' . . . bring
around a bottle of gin/And take a lesson on how to imbibe/From Dr Heckle
and Mr Jibe'' -- through to a sumptuously slow (to begin with, anyway)
Just a Gigolo, complete with German lyrics.
Best of all was a medley of ''Depression feel-good songs by that
ponderous pachyderm, that guru of the grupettos, that sultan of the
Steinway, that admiral of the arpeggios, that elephantine elf of the
ivories -- Fats Waller''. Like Waller, Grosz -- a walking thesaurus --
substitutes synonyms at every opportunity and naturally infuses his good
humour into everything he does.
And, like Waller, Grosz is more than just a jazz man. By the second
set, he had put down his guitar, and picked up the mike to do some real
stand-up as he introduced his English Blues with a long-winded, but
rewarding, surreal flight of fancy involving Sir Edward Elgar,
fig-pickers and the inability of English academics to sing the blues.
Catch him when he plays the Edinburgh Jazz Festival in August.

THERE are few people who have not at some point felt the urge to pen a
creative piece of writing, whether prose, poetry, a novel or play. For
some, the act of committing that piece of work to paper -- or computer
-- fulfils that need so well that they are satisfied enough to finish at
that point.
For others it awakens a latent creativity and talent that begs further
commitment and ultimately a production of that work. However, all too
often this is thwarted almost from the start because there are few
outlets through which it can be expressed, and fewer opportunities to
gain the necessary training and guidance which ultimately transform an
undisciplined writer into a craftsman.
While there are writers groups all over Scotland, running seminars,
workshops and classes, all of them valuable in encouraging and
motivating, developing the skills of the playwright requires a different
kind of approach.
For the past 10 years, one theatre company has been running a
development programme for new playwrights and is considered by funders
and writers alike to have evolved into a major support for new writing
in Scotland.
Annexe Theatre Company's mission when it was first launched in 1985
was to provide a platform for new writers and to develop new writing in
Scotland for Scottish writers. Those objectives have not changed in 10
years but through the extensive experience gained over that decade, the
means of achieving this in 1995 have radically changed.
''We have always felt that there were too few real opportunities for
new writers to have their work produced,'' explains artistic director
Paula Macgee. ''From the start, we were aware that as well as being a
production company, we would have to encourage a climate for new
writers.''
The production side of the company has consistently run in parallel
with the writing development programme, which has taken many varied
forms over the years.
Back in 1986, Annexe's original concept of writing development was
based on a 12-week drama writing and production course funded by the
European Social Fund and attended by 10 ''rookie'' writers.
A writers' group was established as a direct result of that course,
but was to prove through time, that it was a less effective way of
developing new writing than had first been anticipated.
At the same time as the writers' group was operating, Annexe was
advertisements in various newspapers, inviting people to send in
scripts.
''We have always operated a policy of reading unsolicited scripts,''
says Paula. ''It is from those scripts that we look for production
material. We decided that the most effective way forward would be to
work with individual writers on an individual basis, bringing them
together occasionally in small groups for collaborative projects.''
This new development programme, together with the introduction of a
funded script associate to help co-ordinate the writers' development
package, has proved to be a success.
Where Annexe has always had a reading panel for all the scripts coming
into the office, the employment of script associate Chris Ballance has
meant executing that function more competently.
This appointment, together with that of full-time administrator Doreen
McArdle in 1990, who has been able to pick up on funding opportunities
as well as guaranteeing continuity from one production to the next, has
allowed Annexe to maximise its resources and use its funding more
creatively.
This funding, in the main, comes from the Scottish Arts Council, which
has supported the company every year since its inception. Glasgow
District Council has also been very supportive over the years.
This has allowed the targeting of six writers who have been developing
their skills under the umbrella of the company.
In selecting those six writers, two different criteria were used. One
was the potential of the writer and the other was the actual script
which had been submitted. In some cases, the choice was based on both.
The development programme is very much ''hands on''. ''We try very
early on to expose the writers to working with professional actors and a
director -- hearing the play read, spending a week tossing it in the
air, examining the issues explored, examining the writing for areas of
improvement,'' explains Paula.
''Ultimately we are looking for the writer to improve and develop
something that can be taken to full production. Every individual writer
has individual needs so the approach to each script is different, and
decisions are made on an individual basis instead of having a blanket
policy for every play.''
In October 1993, the writers were brought together and spent a week
with guest speakers who included Liz Lochead, Paul Pender and John
Linklater, coming in and talking about professional writing.
They also attended workshop sessions with a team of actors reading
some of the work. As well as their individual work, the six writers were
asked to write collectively as a group -- a collaborative piece of work
that would be staged as soon as funds became available. The project: And
The Winner Is . . . , was staged last October at the Cottier Theatre.
The new programme has also allowed the writers to learn the language
of a rehearsal room, and to work with a director and cast.
The company's applications to the Scottish Arts Council is made up of
writers who have come through the process, and in every new batch of
scripts the reading panel looks for new writers to bring into that
process.
Annexe receives around 70 scripts a year and from this, about 50
writers will have their scripts returned with a report and sometimes a
writers' pack, and they are encouraged to re-submit. Some of those are
second and third applicants, and their progress can be charted.
The other third will be offered a professional reading of their work.
While this was at one time, an end in itself, today it is still very
much at the beginning of the development process.
Writer David Harrower is just one success story for Annexe. On his
development programme he spent three days working on his play with a
director and professional cast.
He has since gone on to have a production at the Traverse Theatre and
has been commissioned by the Traverse for another work this year. He
follows other successful and prolific writers for theatre and television
who have come through the development process, including Peter Murray,
Bob Dows, Doreen McArdle and the late Alan Hayton.
''We hear so often that there is no new writing talent out there, and
those who are going to make it will do it with or without development,''
says Paula Macgee. ''That is like saying that there is no point in going
to drama college because people who want to act will be able to act
without training.
''There has to be a support structure and people have to believe that
there is indigenous talent that can be developed or we are going to have
no new Scottish writers, no new culture of writing, no new theatrical
culture in Scotland that is distinctly Scottish.''
Annexe is currently touring with new writer Bob Adams' play: Coming
Apart, and is about to embark on its new development programme for the
next year which begins in April as well as continuing to bring the work
of the current group to the stage, including a play: Cat and Mouse by
new writer Noel McMonogle, in association with Amnesty International.
The new writing programme also includes a series of play readings by
new writers.
Doreen McArdle's first television play: Four Walls, is part of BBC
Scotland's Lambrusco Nights. It will be shown on 22 March.

''IF you like this show tell the world, if you don't, keep your big
mouth shut,'' admonished Four-Eyed Moe (Tee Jaye Jenkins). Frankly, I'd
be more than happy to climb one of the New York skyscrapers depicted in
the backdrop to holler out that this is one helluva fun night.
The storyline for Clarke Peter's musical, another success from
producer Cameron Mackintosh, is thin but it really doesn't matter; it's
thick with songs and laughter and the six-strong male cast, the
eponymous group, and Lonesome Nomax, who they mysteriously visit, inject
so much energy into their performances that they carry the audience
along with roller-coaster ease.
They slyly lead us into audience participation which has us shrieking
the ludicrous lyrics to the Push Ka Pi Shee Pie song with utter abandon,
and a raucous congo-line was snaking around the theatre even before the
interval. By the second half the audience was singing along
spontaneously, crooning softly to the Louis Jordan number Is You Is Or
Is You Ain't My Baby?
The robust vulgarity of the Jordan song book was portrayed with
consummate musicianship, alongside classics from his contemporaries of
that era, when male part harmony combos ruled the airwaves.
Dragging three girls on stage, Four Eyes apologised for all the
''chauvinistic songs'', but despite all the bitchin' about drinking and
women this was no ladsy entertainment. Ribald lyrics and all, the
toe-tapping songs were none the less romantic homages to womankind,
especially the hilariously illustrated number from Little Moe (Jason
Pennycooke) I like em fat like that. How we applauded.

A NEW generation of string quartets in recent seasons has been
bringing vibrant life to a form of music-making Boulez once predicted to
be heading for extinction.
Many of them, happily, have been appearing in Scotland, and the
Vellinger Quartet last night gave performances of Haydn, Mendelssohn,
and Schubert so passionately integrated that you wanted to hear these
young British players explore the entire repertoire afresh.
With a first violinist as startlingly expressive as Stephanie Gonley
and a cellist as sonorous as Sally Pendlebury, these were performances
of such marvellous intensity at the top and bottom of the register that
their young male partners could hardly fail to respond. The brilliant
repartee in Haydn's B flat quartet, Op 71, No 1, at the start of this
New Town concert showed that this was an ensemble of a quite special
order. But Mendelssohn's E flat quartet, Op 12, was a different sort of
testing ground, and the music's blend of romance and classicism, of
delicacy and fervour, was conveyed with the kind of instinctiveness that
actually implies long and scrupulous rehearsal.
But even better, as things turned out, was Schubert's A minor quartet,
presented without a hint of false wistfulness but with great feeling and
rhythmic alertness. Here, as in the rest of the programme, sections
marked to be repeated were duly repeated, to maximum benefit. This is a
quartet that is clearly going places. Remember the name.

LET'S start by getting this TAFKAP/Symbol/Squiggle thing straight:
whatever name He uses, He's still His bad self, OK? Yet having read the
scathing reviews Himself garnered in London on His UK debut last week,
many of us might have gone along last night fearing the worst. So what
did He give us?
He anointed us in the healing sex-balm of the funky unction, all the
better to summons up the affirmatory spirit of the entire Afro-American
musical continuum. In one solid, righteous groove, we got sweet soul
pleading, a la Chi-Lites and Tyrone Davis; multifarious jams, in the
manner of President George Clinton and King James Brown. We got the
rhythm, the rhyme, and then more of the rhythm.
As well as preacherly funk, we were favoured with teacherly jazz.
Blues-gospel power and gasping boudoir power. Cherubic falsetto; wicked
nasal growl. Homage to Hendrix; rap; funk hop; be bop.
We got scantily-clad burlesque and Nubian belly-dance, courtesy of His
female foil, Ms Mayte. We got some medicine-show hokum. We enjoyed
sanctified funkiness at a carnal communion. He struck charged shapes
that were more than postures. We had, employing the hip-hop demotic, a
moth-cooking good time, yeah-huh.
But was last night an empty exercise in heritage-mongering, a means to
place musical history in perspective and thus disguise the fact that
He's not quite at the cutting-edge of it as once He was? If so, it
didn't feel like it, as we sweated and He smiled and called us
''Scotland!'' like no-one else ever could. Spell his name in
exclamation-marks -- !!!!!!

MY FIRST thought after the Scottish Labour conference in Inverness is
to say sorry to Grampian Television: it was, in fact, BBC Scotland whom
Blair's office tried to cheat of an interview, and I thought the
executive who told me the story was from Grampian because I met him
there, after a programme, three weeks ago. Grovelling apologies; he's a
BBC man . . .
My last memory of conference in Inverness is unedifying: I lost my
temper. This is most unusual. In fairness, it was in the teeth of
extreme provocation.
It was quite late at night, and I was sitting in the lobby of the
Caledonian Hotel, talking happily to a good friend, when a
hungry-looking fellow muscled in. Cutting my pal dead, he crouched by my
elbow, and introduced himself as one of the conference stewards from the
Eden Court Theatre.
He had that deaf, dogged, remorseless, logic of the born intolerant.
He was annoyed by a reference in my piece of the day to ''insolent
stewards'', which was fair enough -- his opinion, my opinion -- but he
demanded their names, which I hadn't troubled to note. He asked me where
I had met them; but it was impossible to explain, because he repeatedly
interrupted.
It was like talking to a wall. It was the narrow, arrogant argument of
the fool who thinks he is clever, whose only concern is to get one over
on you. Indignantly he disclaimed all connection with Keir Hardie House.
He was an Eden Court employee, affiliated to Labour through his trade
union; the stewarding had been organised by the local party branch --
Inverness North North-East, or some such ridiculous name. The job of a
steward, he said, was security. ''We've got the next Prime Minister of
Britain in here, and you . . .'' for all the world as if he and his
surly beauties were the Praetorian Guard.
The last straw was a nasty bit of ad hominem. ''I'll tell you,
Macleod, what it was -- you came up here, a journalist, a prima donna,
thinking that gave you the right to wander all over the building,
utterly unchallenged . . .''
He had a vicious smile. I saw red -- for any sake, all I wanted to do
was get inside their wretched conference; I'd done my best to get a pass
-- and my young friend beside me was growing upset. I said: ''How dare
you speak to me like that? Please leave . . . You come here uninvited,
barge in . . . Leave us!''
He was laughing, withdrawing.
''GO!'' I roared, and heads turned. The wretched man danced away. He
had won, as the other guy does when you lose your rag. I felt tired and
cheap; a few minutes later, I went home.
That's the real face of Labour. That's the side we're all told is but
a memory: the shambling incompetence, the class war, trade unionists
with gloating threats and piggy eyes.
All is Blair and Brahms, slick broadcasts, vacuous rhetoric, minimal
policy outline and beautiful classless youngsters. It's not true.
Beneath the glitz is the same old thuggishness, the same lumbering
career-machine that has reduced central Scotland to a one-party state.
I left Inverness with many questions -- I'd like to know what sort of
serious political organisation leaves the stewarding of its annual
conference -- and one, on this occasion, of United Kingdom importance --
to the mercies of the old-pal system of the local branch, the stewards I
encountered -- bar my friend's mum -- where quite unfit for dealing with
the public.
I'd like to know how many of you out there realise that under a third
of conference delegates were bona fide independent party members. The
bulk of the hall was filled by little trade union blocs. Their voting
was determined by their leaders in caucus. Theoretically, you could defy
their direction; but you wouldn't enjoy a nice weekend in Inverness
again, would you?
I'd like to know if I was at the same conference as most of my
colleagues. I have read nothing but glowing tributes to Blair's speech
(which was rackety, and not well received by large sections of the
audience); breathless hype about the excitement of the Clause 4 debate
(the outcome was never in serious doubt);I was there, all weekend, and
it went like Ivor the Engine after 40 years in the rain. Most of my
colleague wholeheartedly agreed -- off the record.
I'd like to know if you give any thought not to Parliamentary Labour
in opposition but to ruling Labour in reality.
We in the media have failed you. We have failed you because, long ago,
we stopped going to political events like this and telling you what we
saw and what it was really like. We have reduced public politics to
vacuity and ourselves to bit-players in a public relations exercise.
There is a literal hack pack at these events -- a cozy huddle of old
mates -- who seem incapable of independent thought or action. They come
together after every set-piece and agree a common line.
It's time to dump the interview, which has long ceased to be a useful
tool in political dialogue: politicians love them, because they have
long since learned how to say nothing while looking as bonnie as
possible. It's time to keep our distance from politicians.
Things like the lobby system in the House of Commons, the
off-the-record drams, the informal luncheon, the ''reception'', demean
our job, neuter our effectiveness, and deny you -- the public -- the
story like it is.
The reality is that most of you have very little interest in politics.
That is a highly sensible attitude. Party conferences are gatherings to
reward the faithful membership with a few days of glamour, the illusion
of power, a chance to meet the famous and perhaps to appear on
television.
They have long since ceased to be meaningful events, except as public
relations exercises. What then are we to make of Inverness last week --
and the blithe refusal of your appointed eyes, en masse to reveal it for
the farce it was?

YOU don't often come across public relations for schools being
debated. When it happens the debate, sadly, tends to become bogged down
on media relations, often at the level of what pictures and stories can
be got into the local paper.
If news breaks that a school, usually a private one, has hired a firm
of public relations consultants, eyebrows are raised. Many teachers
wonder why such a step has been taken, and others voice fears that
education may be lowering its standing by seeking to promote itself.
However, schools need far more professional public relations and have
to come to the mature realisation that there is nothing flawed about PR
in the sphere of education.
Public relations can simply be defined as a way of relating an
organisation to the various constituents it serves. There is nothing
demeaning for schools in that. Identifying and targeting them -- whether
they are pupils, parents, councillors, churches or the wider community
-- and finding the most effective method of communicating with them is
simply good practice and teachers, as communication professionals,
should see that clearly.
A school's public relations is about all of its activities, from
producing handbooks and newsletters to parents, to its buildings and
whether they are welcoming.
It is gratifying that many schools have taken some action in many of
these areas. And there has been an increasing awareness of better media
relations.
But all schools have to realise that there is another and very much
more pressing side of dealing with the media, and that is managing the
school response to a tragedy or emergency.
That's where the school would do well to have a tried and tested media
emergency plan ready, rather than having to respond under pressure in
circumstances which can be emotionally draining. And, in these days of a
more intrusive media with live broadcast facilities, the member of staff
who normally deals with the media, perhaps to the point of being known
as the school press officer, must understand that there is a level
beyond which he or she cannot go. Media handling in a real crisis is
best left to a trained press officer from the local authority.
There is also the issue of what schools think make good news stories.
Of course, schools should try to get the good news out. At a basic
level, it is credit in the bank against the bad times.
But a perusal of our weekly press cuttings from around the region
tells me that far too few schools are getting out the really good news
about education, that youngsters are achieving, that the curriculum is
being taught in an imaginative and effective way, and that schools are
places where staff and pupils work, in the vast majority of cases, in
harmony.
What the media tends to get from schools is a constant diet of stories
about fundraising for charity. Of course, charity has a place to play in
the media output of a school but it should not be the only output, and
it should be part of a comprehensive public relations strategy for the
school.
And that's the real crunch, for public relations still tend to be seen
as extras. Few schools have written them into development planning in
the way in which further education colleges have taken public relations
to heart. Doing that means learning the lesson that further education
learned some 10 years ago.
It also means allocating a budget to public relations and writing a
public relations function into the staffing of the school, so that
discharging the function comes to depend on a system rather than on a
member of staff who happens to have a flair for public relations.
So let's get the debate about public relations for schools underway.
Schools live in a more accountable world and effective PR can help
schools survive in it by making sure that its communications are as
professional as possible.
* Hugh Dougherty is senior press officer with Strathclyde region's
public relations department.

NOT for the first time the luggage went missing; 4000 pieces, to be
precise, although countless others had a hand in that mountain of
packing. It was in Milan's Linate Airport that the suitcase vigil began.
In the usual way BA566 from Heathrow had coughed out most passengers'
belongings, but remaining in the luggage hall at least 50 of us clung on
to the edge of the empty conveyor-belt in a sort of vacant trance. One
hour later there were only two conclusions: we were either the victims
of a lightning industrial strike or targets of bandits working the
biggest transfer depot in the world.
In fact the computer showed our bags had never made it to the Milan
plane. Instead they had become merely some among thousands caught in a
massive, unaccountable snarl-up at Heathrow. Or else, said an Italian
official, adding bravado to routine, the bags were wrongly stowed and
were probably now en route to the chaos of New Delhi.
There are assignments in the writing life where the type of clothes
worn doesn't really matter very much. Covering the Milan fashion
collections is not one of them, and there is a limit to the changes that
can be wrung from a large scarf, one white shirt, a trouser-suit, and
black coat.
But at the lost-luggage desk, the Italian authorities assured the
stranded that in 90% of such incidents the luggage arrives at people's
hotels by midnight. ''And if not,'' said the one who liked to dismiss
crises as comic opera, ''you all turn into pumpkins.''
It was early evening when all the formalities were complete, and as
midnight approached word filtered through from Heathrow that a ''gullet
problem'' in the transfer mechanism was continuing. But yes, the baggage
reference numbers were in the computer, and yes, everyone was now
hopeful of a Sunday-afternoon delivery.
That day the weather was warm enough for the trouser-suit to be worn
shirtless, thus achieving a certain thrown-together nonchalance. Next
day, Monday, shirtless again, it carried for outre effect a tie worn
loosely about a naked neck. But by Tuesday the luggage reference numbers
had vanished from the system, and so as to give the trousers of the
trouser-suit a rest, the large scarf had been deployed as an emergency
sarong. Prepared for the worst on Wednesday, we made plans to wear the
jacket back-to-front.
By then it seemed obvious that the bags really had disappeared, and so
a replacement wardrobe was in order, all receipts to be forwarded to
British Airways. So we arrived back at the hotel late on Wednesday,
bearing packages which began with shoes and ended with an umbrella.
And no sooner had we beaten back the waves of tissue paper to achieve
a new appearance, than there was a knock at the door, and standing
outside were two black bags, beaten and grungy looking and drenched to
the marrow like a couple of dejected strays. On one the double zipper
had been broken but the contents remained intact. On the second, the
original luggage tags appeared to have been chewed by a rodent.
Other than that, neither piece bore any hint of having carried on an
independent life in some mysterious location, except that towards the
bottom of the broken bag there were a few white feathers, as if some
bird had considered nesting there.
The trouble with possessions, though, is that enough is never enough,
for now an additional piece of luggage was required to replace the
collapsed holdall, and, indeed, to cart home the wretched extra bunch of
schmutters.
What such experience teaches is that life, very clearly, is divided
into two types of pilgrim, the first plagued by the dead weight of
lumber at every turn, dragging it to the airport, checking it in,
fretting about whether it is on the plane, hanging around waiting for
it, sometimes futilely, at the other end, then staggering with the
cursed load towards that fleet of suddenly invisible taxis.
And then there are others who travel as minimally as a Trappist, the
world's true voyagers who, like refugees, have learned that packing
requires not time and paraphernalia but sacrifice. Possessions mean
nothing if they cannot be squashed into a kitbag, hauled high on the
shoulder, and transported at the gallop towards tomorrow.
For just five days some of us on BA566 curiously came to enjoy the
light freedom of that adventure. So much so, that the mere thought of
luggage may keep us holidaying in the garden from now on.

PRIMARY schools are the focus of the new initiative on healthy eating
being implemented by Strathclyde region's Catering Services. With
funding of #135,000 over two years from the region's social strategy
budget, 850 schools and 204,000 pupils will be urged to ''Keep Your
Balance'' -- the motto of the campaign.
Rangers and Celtic are lending support in a variety of ways --
personal appearances by players, public endorsement by the chairmen and
managers and pitch-side and scoreboard advertising.
At one of 10 local launches -- at Edinbarnet Primary School in Faifley
-- Brian O'Neil of Celtic was on hand as Catering Services offered a
highly polished display which included not only ''The Pudding Club'', a
video presented by Andrea Boardman of Disney Club, but also an
entertainment interlude from the comedian Dean Park and Bobo the Clown,
who features on the ''Keep Your Balance'' logo.
Strathclyde's Food and Health Policy was devised four years ago, but
this is the most ambitious attempt to have its message fully accepted.
According to the director of Catering Services, Avril Robertson, ''heart
diseases and strokes account for 43% and cancers 34% of deaths in
Strathclyde in the age group 45-64 years. Scotland also has one of the
highest incidences of strokes in the developed world. Scots have 2.5
times more chance of dying from a stroke than those in the United States
or the Netherlands.''
Nutritionally balanced meals are therefore essential. ''This is the
thinking behind the 'Keep Your Balance' campaign,'' said Mrs Robertson.
''To those involved -- food purchasing managers, staff who prepare
menus, school catering staff, teachers, parents and pupils -- we are
emphasising the need for a proper balance in the child's diet.''
The steering group of experts who produced the Food and Health Policy
set out to reduce the amount of salt, fat and sugar and increasing the
incidence of fibre. The balance which they recommend consists of three
parts starchy carbohydrates (for example bread, cereals, rice, pasta,
potatoes etc.) to two parts fruit and vegetables to one part proteins
(for example chicken, fish, meat, eggs, milk and beans).
The policy document accepts that it is ''unreasonable to expect all
primary school children to select meals with a balanced nutrient
content'' and suggests guidelines to avoid grossly-imbalanced school
lunches:
* Chips available no more than twice a week, and only as an
accompaniment.
* Pupils restricted to a maximum of two pudding, cake or biscuit
items.
* Yoghurt and fresh fruit always available as an alternative to other
desserts.
Fergus Chambers, depute director of Catering Services, presented a
sample menu of the sort to be displayed in school cafeterias, weighted
and colour-coded to assist children in pursuing a healthy diet -- yellow
being carbohydrates, green fruit and vegetables, and blue proteins.
Lentil soup, for example would be yellow and green, chicken curry and
rice two yellow and blue, vegetable lasagne two yellow and green, baked
potato and baked beans three yellow and blue, and beef casserole green
and blue.
A teaching resource pack, geared to the 5-14 curriculum, will be
issued to Strathclyde primary schools by the end of this month. Though
the initiative is aimed at the primary sector, links with secondaries
will be pursued through the issue of a copy of the materials to home
economics departments and the evaluation of a pilot scheme in which a
few secondaries will collaborate with their associated primaries.
Jan Cresswell, senior health promotion officer with Greater Glasgow
Health Board, was a member of the steering group which devised the Food
and Health Policy. ''This initiative by Catering Services is a
significant one which has to be set within a national context,'' she
explains.
''The Health Education Board for Scotland, which has produced a guide
for schools, Towards Healthier Snacks, occupies a central role, and
School Nutrition Action Groups are now being set up. However, if
nutrition is taught differently in the schools, and teachers can be
influenced by what they perceive as good for themselves, the message
could be lost. We should also remember that it is not just diet which
affects health. The amount of exercise is also important.''
Anna Baxendale, health promotion officer for nutrition, emphasises
early intervention. ''That is how to influence eating habits outside
school, and into later life,'' she says. ''In particular, there is scope
for improving our poor record of consumption of fruit and vegetables.''
Jan Cresswell hopes Catering Services can find the finance to expand
the initiative across secondary schools. ''That is where a really
sophisticated approach to promoting a healthy diet is needed,'' she
says. ''There is also the problem that tuck shops, which raise funds for
schools, can sell whatever they like, and even in the school cafeterias,
those at the end of the queue may have less choice.''

TUCKED away on page 141 of the Scottish Office's detailed spending
plans for the fiscal year starting next month is a prosaic encapsulation
of Ian Lang's objectives for local government.
Having made clear at the outset that almost 50% of all the resources
available to him are distributed, in turn, to local councils, the text
continues:
''The Secretary of State's aim, in establishing the level of central
government support to local authorities, is to provide sufficient
resources to enable authorities to finance a reasonable level and
pattern of services that respond effectively to the needs of their
customers without placing an undue burden on local tax payers.''
Hardly sublime poetry. Nothing there to set souls soaring. The
anonymous author would have been a rank also-ran in the competition to
rewrite Labour's Clause 4. But those 51 mundane words spell out, more
graphically than any high-flown mission statement, one of the central
dilemmas of modern politics.
To get elected at all, all parties have to preach the doctrine of
unwavering fiscal prudence, for fear a fickle electorate will feel for
the security of their wallets and purses as they deliver their crosses
on the ballot paper. But, to achieve anything once in power, most
politicians, even Tory ministers in charge of spending departments,
still find it hard to resist equating that achievement with finding more
things to do with more taxpayers' money.
I woke up last Friday to discover that our family happens to live in
the one local authority area in Scotland where the council tax is to be
reduced in the coming year. My first instinct was not to rush downstairs
and crack open some bubbly. What it might mean for house values in our
village didn't even cross my mind.
With a weather eye on the new unitary Stirling authority due to take
over regional functions like education next year, my first instinct was
to wonder what ongoing Tory control of our council might mean for the
rambling collection of Victorian original, sixties add-ons and eighties
Portacabins which constitute the inadequate physical fabric of the
admirable local secondary school my older boy attends.
The local Tory group leader's reported relish -- given a further
mandate, of course -- to hack into regional fat and release even bigger
tax cuts next year is qualified by a promise to put more resources into
front-line services, like schools. But where, precisely, would
Councillor Harding strike the balance?
Does a school which parents from as far away as the Vale of Leven and
north-west Glasgow are desperate to opt in to already constitute, in the
Scottish Office rubric, ''a reasonable level of service'', whatever
state the buildings are in?
After all, if the spending plans outlined for the next three years by
the Scottish Office are to be believed, the balance between reasonable
services and the avoidance of an ''undue burden'' on local taxpayers
will have to be struck against the backdrop of a tough ongoing squeeze
in central government support for local councils.
In real terms, total expenditure within the Scottish Secretary's
control is to be cut by #627m, between the estimated spend in the year
just ending and the planned spending in 1997/98. Of that #627m cut, by
far the lion's share -- #528m, to be precise -- is to come out of
central government support for local authorities.
In other words, the recipients of just under 50% of the resources
available to the Scottish Secretary are being asked to absorb 84% of the
planned cuts in Scottish Office expenditure over the next three years.
That looks like very real pain for the new unitary councils, already
wrestling with their new-found responsibility for unfamiliar
labour-intensive services like education and social work.
We are promised by its architects that local government reform will
save us all money in the medium term by simplifying structures and
cutting down on bureaucracy. But even Mr Lang and Sir Michael Hirst now
abjure the claim that these hoped-for savings will come quickly.
So, even if these economies prove to have substance -- I, for one,
will be amazed if the creation of 32 little-and-large all-purpose
authorities saves a single penny -- they will not come quickly enough to
rescue the new authorities from some hard financial choices in the early
years.
I am worried about what these pressures may mean for my children's
education. You may have different priorities. But, short of scrapping
public provision and turning everything over to the competitive market
place, we all have an interest in maximising the quality of these
services if we are to continue to live in a civilised society.
That said, good schools, safe streets, efficient refuse collection and
disposal and well-maintained roads all cost money. There's no dodging
that fact. If we are not prepared to pay for quality public services, we
will get what you always get when you try to buy on the cheap -- the
second best, the third rate.
The persistent rhetoric of recent years about profligate councils
undoubtedly had some substance, at the margin. But that rhetoric has
also fostered an unhealthy climate among the electorate at large. We
have been encouraged to think that, as far as local services are
concerned, we can get something, if not for nothing, at least for a lot
less than we pay right now.
I happen to think that, in return for having our two boys educated,
our household refuse efficiently and obligingly removed each week,
well-lit streets and a village policeman just a call away we are getting
a pretty good bargain for our council tax. Am I alone in that?

THE Diary's contribution to Grand Slam fever is to offer a genuine
Scotland rugby shirt signed by the team and a signed ball.
These come courtesy of the Famous Grouse scotch whisky, sponsors of
the Scotland team. The nice people in charge of the low-flier whisky
suggested a competition in which you have to answer two questions:
* Which well-known Scottish brand sponsors the Scottish Rugby Union
team and the Rugby World Cup?
* Name one of the three other teams in Scotland's pool in Rugby World
Cup 1995.
These questions are a bit technical for the average Herald Diary
reader so we have replaced them with a simple multiple choice.
What is Nelson Mandela likely to take to the Rugby World Cup final in
June:
* An All-Black scarf?
* A hip flask of Famous Grouse?
* His official car?
Look, people, this is a serious competition so get your entries in
now. This time next week you could be the owner of a jersey which will
be a souvenir of an epoch-making victory for Scottish rugby. Or a rather
smart duster.

WILDCAT, the left-wing musical theatre people, are presenting a show
called Bedfellows next month at the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow. It is
about a totally fictitious Scottish Tory MP called Sir Christopher
Vainwean who occupies the equally fictitious seat of Auchtergeldie.
In the play, the character Vainwean is famous for bed-hopping, toping,
and groping. All of this might ring a bell and, with the demise of Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn, there could be accusations of bad taste. Poor chap
hardly cold in his grave, etc.
The two Wildcat Daves, Anderson and McLennan, have come up with the
perfect answer. ''We'll call it a tribute,'' they say.
To crown it all
ONE of the bedrooms in the Glen Mhor Hotel in Inverness is called the
Prince Charles suite. It is so-called because the Prince of Wales once
had breakfast there.
Then the room was turned into a romantic boudoir complete with
four-poster bed. It is perhaps a simile for the state of royal romance
these days that beneath the canopy in the Prince Charles suite there is
no longer a four-poster fit for a royal couple but two single beds.
Digging in
CHANGED days indeed when the Scottish section of the National Union of
Miners votes in favour of scrapping the Labour party's commitment to
nationalisation of essential industries. Not so surprising really,
points out one of the Diary's advisers on labour movement matters. With
the workers' buy-out, most of the Scottish miners are now shareholders
and some even company directors.
''The next thing to look out for,'' he says, ''is the NUM's use of the
block vote at the annual conference of the Institute of Directors.''
Altogether now
CLAUSE 4 may be on the way out but the Red Flag remains the song with
which the People's Party closes its conference. It is surely only a
matter of time before the stirring anthem is cast aside in the race to
capture votes.
A straw poll among a group of Labourites in Inverness revealed that
Happy Talk, the cheerful number from The King and I, complete with hand
actions, would be an ideal substitute. As Tony Blair says, if you don't
have a dream, how you gonna have a dream come true?
Beyond the pail
THE GMB -- An Apology. In a recent Diary item we claimed that an
unconstitutional meeting of members and officers of the General and
Municipal trade union had drawn up a list of delegates to the GMB annual
conference in Brighton this year.
We said that this list of 43 delegates, known as the pail and spade
brigade, would then be rubber-stamped in a less than convincing show of
democracy at the ballot box.
We now understand that only 37 of the names on the list were
eventually selected as delegates. We do not fully understand the
workings of the GMB but at the Labour Party conference in Inverness the
message was quite clear from one chap who failed to make the
pail-and-spade list to a comrade who had obviously let him down.
The latter was seen retiring red-faced from the bar followed by a
shout of: ''You're not getting any more votes from Dundee.''
Card carriers
LABOUR MPs have been on the receiving end of a mail-shot offering
birthday cards which they can send to first-time voters.
The card, complete with red rose illustration, contains a verse which
makes you wonder what is the Hampden Roar with the People's Party these
days:
You are an adult now, the child has gone
Time to see where you are coming from
You may have dreams or jobs you want to do
Trust in the Labour Party, we have hope for you.
Tarry not for time may lag
Gie's a break, pass the sick bag.
Yes, OK, we wrote the last two lines but the first bit is genuine.

IT used to be said that the definition of a tourist in Glasgow was
someone who'd got lost looking for Edinburgh. Not any more. The dear
green place is now the third most popular tourism destination in the
United Kingdom, and Glasgow's tourist guides are gearing up to the
challenge.
The city is already home to around 80 of Scotland's 200 official
''Blue Badge'' guides, but more are needed. This year, the University of
Strathclyde, in conjunction with the Scottish Tourist Guides
Association, will be running a training course. There are no formal
academic qualifications but prospective candidates do need a second
language -- along with a love of Scotland's history and heritage and the
desire to put it across in an informative and entertaining way.
The course directors are Jennefer Hutton Riley and Evelyn Tiefenbrun
of knowhow, Training for Tourism, both of whom are Scottish Tourist
Guides themselves, with 15 years' experience between them. The company
has been involved with tourism training for the past two years. Among
other things they undertook the staff training for the St Mungo Museum
and are currently involved with the Scottish Tourist Board's ''Welcome
Host'' initiative.
There is a particular shortage of German speaking guides but other
languages are called for too, including Dutch, Polish and Russian, the
last two to cope with the expected influx of visitors from the Eastern
bloc within the next few years.
The course will cost #975. Some local enterprise companies have said
that they may be prepared to help candidates with this. There is also
the possibility of funding the one-year course with a career development
loan. In any case, the course will be run on a part-time basis, allowing
participants to continue with their current jobs.
Jennefer Hutton Riley of knowhow states that successful candidates
will be able to recoup the cost of the course with the proceeds of 12
days' work. Tour guiding, although seasonal, can be a real career, she
says, and an exciting one. Guides are all self-employed and many choose
to combine guiding with other professional activities. Like all Scottish
Tourist Guides, the new Glasgow guides, once qualified, will be capable
of guiding groups and individuals all over the country.
The course runs from October 1995 until May 1996 and further
information can be had from Evelyn Tiefenbrun on 0141 639 5925 or
Jennefer Hutton Riley on 0141 639 1911.

Lone parents are being helped back into the job market thanks to a
series of courses aimed at recognised qualifications, and boosting
morale Barbara Mackenzie reports.
THERE are 70,000 lone parents in Strathclyde, and for many, access to
training and education is imperative if they are to compete on equal
terms in the job market, reshape their lives, or simply beat the poverty
trap.
Before they can take such practical steps, however, many have to deal
with psychological and emotional barriers to growth: feelings of
isolation, insecurity, and low self-esteem.
Helping them to do this is One Plus, an organisation for one-parent
families based in Glasgow's Hope Street and covering the Strathclyde
region. An independent organisation, it campaigns to achieve equality of
opportunity for lone parents whether single, widowed, divorced, or
separated, and regardless of sex, race, colour, or religion.
It offers a range of services, including advice and counselling;
support for lone parent and women's groups; drama, writing, and video
projects; child-care facilities; a resource centre; and, most important,
customised vocational training and workshops for those wishing to enter
or return to training, education, or employment.
Marion Davis is the information officer for One Plus and her work also
involves development and training. She says: ''The major route out of
poverty is to offer access to high-quality training. The Government has
been critical of lone parents and they have a negative press but if you
give them opportunities and the support to develop themselves, the
majority will respond.''
She emphasises, however, that many barriers to training and education
exist and these have to be addressed. Problems can be financial,
cultural, socio-economic, or linguistic. They can include location and
such factors as lack of child care facilities, disability, personal
commitments, little previous education, and the inappropriate structure
of available courses.
One of the new programmes initiated by the organisation is a 40-week
full-time vocational course called Administration ''Plus'' which started
last month. Modules include: Office practice, which takes in economics,
consumer studies, and book-keeping; computer technology; personal
development and confidence building; and planning future opportunities
in employment, training, and education. Each week trainees spend one day
at One Plus, one day in a work placement, one day of open learning and
two days at the Glasgow College of Nautical Studies.
Administration ''Plus'' replaces the successful 23-week courses in
Information Work, which ran for three years and also involved the
college.
Eva Asante, the course co-ordinator, explains: ''Previously, only the
college modules led to Scotvec Certificates. All the elements in the new
course count towards the final qualification of a Scotvec-approved
certificate in Administration (GSVQ level II). This means that it is
nationally accepted by employers and gives the trainees something to be
confident about.''
Carol Thomson, who is the college's student services manager, explains
its involvement: ''The institution has been recently restructured and is
placing a greater emphasis on contribution to the community. This course
is one of our local collaborative programmes.''
She also points out that funding providers are increasingly demanding
links to SVQs. ''What One Plus is doing is one way to achieve that,''
she adds.
Marion Davis says that the vocational training was developed in
response to lone parents' needs. ''People were phoning us to ask for
ways for getting education. They had no confidence, no-one to take care
of their children, not much money, and some had not been in education or
training since the age of 16.''
Of the people who qualify to do One Plus courses the majority are
women, simply because most lone parents are women. All must have been
out of full-time employment for more than a year. Participants, if on
benefits, can stay on them and may receive travelling expenses and help
with child care costs.
Lindsay Buchanan is a single mother living in Cumbernauld with two
sons aged 12 and 10. She completed the Information Work course two years
ago and is now in the first year of a philosophy, politics, and
sociology degree at Glasgow University, having completed an access
course at Cumbernauld College.
She joined One Plus initially to get out of the house, and says: ''It
certainly helped my self-confidence and my ability to do what I am doing
now. I got a lot of support and encouragement.'' Buchanan is finding
university study hard, but while not looking too far ahead she is
determined to succeed, saying; ''I took my other courses a day at a
time; this one I'm taking a term at a time so at the moment I am looking
to get through my first year successfully.''
Although success for some trainees will be obtaining employment, for
others simply completing a course, building up self-confidence, and
working out a personal action plan is a victory.
Marian Davis explains: ''Some people use the course to get back into a
routine; some as a means of assessing their capabilities; others as a
stepping stone to further or higher education; and yet others to help
them on the road to a job.''
Whatever the reasons, vocational training customised for lone parents
fulfils a radical and increasing social need.

FOR most of last year 13-year-old Kiyoteru Okochi was bullied and
intimidated by a group of his classmates. As well as being pushed around
and taunted the second year junior high school pupil was forced to sell
his favourite comics and computer games to raise the money the bullies
demanded from him.
Towards the end of the year the bullies took Kiyoteru to a river and
repeatedly forced his head under the water.
By then he had had enough. ''I can't stand it anymore'' he wrote
before hanging himself in the garden of his home in Nishio, central
Japan.
Earlier in the year a 14-year-old junior high school pupil hanged
himself at his home in Tsukui-machi, central Japan, after his classmates
had spread margarine and chalk dust over his desk and put pins on his
chair.
Dozens of other victims of classroom bullying have also committed
suicide during the past year in a country where excessive bullying or
''ijime'' is a widespread problem.
''Around 20,000 bullying incidents are logged at state-run schools
every year,'' says teacher Sayaka Takahashi. ''It is the biggest
discipline problem Japanese teachers have to deal with.''
The record high truancy figures reported by the Ministry of Education
have also been linked to the bullying problem. Tens of thousands of
pupils are now refusing to attend school because of the treatment they
receive from bullies.
''Many pupils become 'school-phobic' because of bullying,'' says
Sayaka Takahashi. In an effort to deal with the problem the country's
education authorities have been appointing welfare officers to work in
schools.
Special phone-lines have also been established to provide the victims
of bullying, and their parents, with additional advice.
But many parents believe that schools still don't do enough. Indeed,
they have been accused of encouraging ''ijime''.
The excessive uniformity and highly competitive nature of Japanese
education certainly makes some teachers less than tolerant of slower
learners who hold back classes. All pupils are expected to work through
the same courses at the same pace.
Some teachers are also accused of setting bad examples to the bullies.
Although physical punishment has been banned from Japanese schools a few
teachers continue to resort to physical threats and actual violence.
In one much-publicised case a teacher administered electric shocks to
a group of pupils who had forgotten to bring their textbooks to his
class.
It is those pupils who find it difficult to conform to the rigid
regimentation and authoritarianism of Japanese schools who often fall
victim to bullies. A growing number of parents and teachers now believe
that major reform of the country's competitive education system is the
only effective solution.
But the Ministry of Education is reluctant to radically change an
education system which has been credited with helping Japan become one
of the word's most successful industrial superpowers.
One mother, Yasuko Kodero, decided to write a book outlining ways in
which parents can help their children deal with bullying after her
daughter had endured a long period of physical and mental abuse at
school.
Kodera's daughter was repeatedly pinched and kicked by her classmates
who also called her a freak. ''The worst years of my life'' was how she
later described the ordeal.
The bullying stopped only after her mother went to the school and
confronted one of the bullies. Dragging him into a toilet cubicle she
threatened to make the boy's life a misery unless he stopped tormenting
the girl.
Kodera decided to write the book, which has become a bestseller, after
receiving little help or sympathy from her daughter's school. She says
the victims of bullying, and their parents, should not blame themselves.
''One of the worst aspects of bullying is the negative impact it has
on the victim's self-esteem. In Japan's group-oriented society exclusion
from the group is a traumatic experience.''

Ronnie Smith, a 43-year-old Shetlander, was appointed general
secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland last month in
succession to Jim Martin.
WHAT do you remember of your first day at school?
A sense of excitement tinged with fear. Also the first line of our
reading book, ''I am old Lob''.
WHAT single thing captures your time at primary school?
The sense of panic when I had finished sitting the ''control exam'' in
primary seven and I thought I had turned over two pages of the test
booklet at once, thereby missing a number of questions. I thought my
whole future was ruined.
WHAT single moment represents your time at secondary?
The mixed feelings I had the day I left school. I thoroughly enjoyed
secondary school and was sad to leave but felt a sense of anticipation
at escaping from an island community to the ''big smoke'' of Aberdeen.
WHAT was your most disheartening experience at school?
Coping with technical drawing. I was so hopelessly lost that the
teacher decided to go back to square one and asked me to draw the
various views of a cube. I failed! With two others I was farmed out to
the workshop to mass-produce test tube racks by cutting up wooden pegs
and shoving them into blocks of wood.
WHO was your favourite teacher, and why?
A French teacher whose enthusiasm for his subject, his pupils, and his
craft -- indeed for life in general -- knew no limits. He had a precious
ability to motivate people.
WHICH teacher did you hate?
A technical teacher whose idea of motivating his class was to boast
how he had once taught a pupil who could now draw drainpipes to a
greater degree of accuracy with the naked eye than anyone else in the
country!
WERE you ever the teacher's pet?
I think not but I do recall the pleasure in primary school of once
being asked to ring the handbell to mark the end of the school day.
WHICH teacher most influenced you, and why?
Probably my teacher in my early to middle years at primary school. She
was highly organised and a stickler for precision and accuracy. The
solid groundwork laid in primary school was invaluable in the later
stages. I would never underestimate the importance of the work done by
primary teachers.
WHAT book most influenced you when you were at school, and why?
No single book springs to mind. I must confess to no great enthusiasm
for literature generally, though I am an avid reader of newspapers, both
local and national.
WHAT lessons from school do you apply in your life now?
My upbringing and schooling were in small communities, schools, and
classes. Everyone knew everyone else and this meant we were always
treated as individuals and valued as such. I would like to think I apply
this in my dealings with people.
WHAT was your favourite subject?
Latin. I thoroughly enjoyed the complexity, although the language had
a logical structure. A great intellectual challenge, whose demise I
regret.
WHAT advice would you give young people today?
I hesitate to offer advice. I have enjoyed huge good fortune in
growing up through the 1950s and 1960s and benefitting from the great
educational and employment opportunities available to my generation. Now
I see young people facing unemployment and access to higher education
once more limited to those who can afford it. We are regressing. I
suppose my advice would be -- don't walk away from society which treats
you so badly, get involved and try to change it.
IF you could go back and change anything about your school life, what
would it be?
The selection of pupils at primary seven into separate senior and
junior secondary schools was cruel and destructive. The wedge it drove
between friends and classmates was as hurtful for those who
''succeeded'' as it was for those who ''failed''.
WHAT did you learn behind the bikeshed?
I was never admitted to the inner circle which populated that part of
the premises.
WHO was the school bully?
I honestly do not recall there being one in particular. Bullying did
happen from time to time and I hated it as much then as I do now.
WHAT songs did you sing on the school bus?
We only had a school bus in the early primary years (Lerwick is a
small town!) Then the driver was so revered a figure that we did not
dare step out of line. In a town of 6000 people everyone ''knew his
father'' so the slightest misdemeanour would be reported back.
WHAT misdemeanour did you not get caught for?
Skipping school. A group of us hatched a plan to miss a total of eight
individual periods over a term -- this being the equivalent of one full
day. We succeeded with impunity. This illustrates well the limitations
of the recently-published absence statistics for schools. Our 'absences'
were not recorded!
HAVE you been back to your school? What was it like?
Just once. Since I left, it has become a comprehensive with a massive
increase in roll and a huge extension -- a very different institution
but still, I believe, providing a very high quality of teaching and
learning.
WHO was your school sweetheart?
Ah well! She never knew of my feelings at the time and I would not
want to embarrass her now!
WHO, at your school, was poised for fame and became famous?
Aly Bain was the maintenance joiner during my early years at secondary
school.
WHAT did you carry in your school bag?
Books!?

MAY I comment on M Goldie's attack on the solicitor profession (March
7)? The number of solicitors struck off during the year 1993/94 was
five. The number holding practising certificates was 7807 as at October
31, 1994.
Conveyancing fees in Scotland, far from being excessive, are now at a
level which in many instances does not reflect the time, skill, labour,
and responsibility involved, to say nothing of modern office overheads.
Clients of solicitors have a unique level of protection. The guarantee
fund compensates in cases of dishonesty. There is no cap or ceiling on
claims. In contrast, when BCCI collapsed, depositors found compensation
was available only in respect of 75% of the deposit up to #20,000.
In cases of negligence the client is protected by the fact that every
firm of solicitors has professional indemnity cover under a master
insurance policy. Every firm has to carry at least #1m worth of cover.
Finally, the Law Society of Scotland has extensive powers in cases of
inadequate professional services. What other profession affords these
protections to clients?

IT would appear that the thinning of resources of the much maligned
British Gas has now extended to their contractors.
Replacement of an aged gas mains, adjacent to my property, was started
in December and now, four months on, is still not completed.
After the mandatory 10 minute wait on the phone, I was informed that
the contractor involved carries out emergency cover for the company on a
rota basis. Any other work is suspended as the contractor does not have
the manpower to cope.
Of course the weather has been bad, which as we all know is a freak
occurrence, and a six-week break at Christmas slowed things up. There
was a time when inconvenience to the public would have been a major
consideration. Now cutting costs seems to be the only criterion to which
British Gas adheres.

BIG, brash, and boring. This description might well apply to the
critical appraisal of this year's RSA Student Exhibition in Edinburgh by
your esteemed art critic, Clare Henry (March 6).
Instead of a constructive, considered piece we experienced the full
vitriolic force of a disgruntled Clare Henry. She claims young artists
are thrust into the limelight before their time and she then isolates
certain students as particularly worthy of blunt criticism.
By referring to students in the manner of a court report, whereby they
become art criminals, Clare Henry hardly alleviates this perceived
problem. Irrespective of whether she finds certain works artistically
satisfying or not, her job is surely not to indulge in a disturbingly
dismissive piece but rather to explain why she felt certain aspects of
this year's show were unsuccessful.

PEOPLE in Drumchapel get about 56 minutes to the hour while people in
Bearsden get about 64 minutes. This adds up to an eight-year difference
in life expectancy, a huge difference which cannot be explained by an
aberrant minority, as suggested by Dr J A Duncan (March 7).
Inequality in health is not confined to the periphery of big cities.
It is a major feature of contemporary Scotland and a massive public
health problem. There is a four-year difference in life expectancy
between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Unhealthy lifestyles are partly responsible but do not fully explain
why less affluent people die earlier from all major categories of death.
The title on some letters, ''Poverty and health'', limits
understanding of this issue. The straight-line relationship between
income and longevity does not flatten out above a ''poverty line''. The
differences in life expectancy between high-income and middle-income
groups are as large as those between middle-income and low-income
groups.
Two recent ''natural experiments'' support a casual interpretation of
this relationship. First, the largest increases in life expectancy
within the European Union have occurred in countries which moved towards
more equitable distributions of income. Secondly, there is recent UK
economic policy.
The top 10% of earners in the UK were 60% better off in 1990 than they
were in 1980, while the bottom 10% stood still. Inequalities in health
widened over the period, not because mortality rates in poor people
increased but because mortality rates in affluent groups fell faster.
Government policy has shown that inequalities in health can be changed
in the wrong direction.
It is a tall order to abolish inequality, but a more immediate task is
to reverse current trends. The solution lies in Bearsden, not
Drumchapel. Are people who gained economically during the 1980s prepared
to sustain personal financial loss to help reduce inequalities?
The real issues are social division and cohesion. Dying prematurely is
the ultimate exclusion from society but gives rise to private grief not
public outrage. Consequences of economic exclusion which affect affluent
groups more directly seem a more likely impetus for change.
Begging is one example. We didn't have this in our country 10 years
ago. Personal safety didn't used to be a popular concern, but it is now.
We have to decide the sort of society in which we want our children to
grow up. If we share the resources of our country more fairly, we shall
have a more cohesive society, and reduce inequalities in health. It
cannot happen the other way round.

I AM glad Fiona Campbell has faith in her convictions regarding
Railtrack's maintenance of the Forth railway bridge (March 4). Has she
seen the bridge herself?
I urge her to ponder over the worrying contents of the parliamentary
debates regarding the condition of the bridge: for example, the
statement made by the member for Cunninghame South, after an inspection,
that ''corrosion was at an extreme stage''.
He added: ''There is absolutely no evidence of paint on the part of
the structure nearest the river Forth. Bulging steel and warped steel
plates are visible. In some areas, there is a void of any structure.''
I note your report that the Labour Party is demanding an independent
engineering assessment of the bridge to be commissioned by Railtrack.
This is no use. If it is commissioned by Railtrack it will not be
independent, and I feel there may be other independent engineers who, in
a genuine effort to preserve our heritage, would gladly give their views
on a no-cost basis.

I WOULD like to support Phil Taylor and add a further contribution to
his list of Glasgow hospitals in crisis, that of Mearnskirk Hospital,
which cares for 130 frail elderly patients (March 4).
A public meeting was held, attended by over 100 people. Later a
petition containing 9214 signatures was presented to Sir Robert
Calderwood, chairman of the Greater Glasgow Health Board, and a further
420 signatures have since been posted.
The feeling of apathy is at last being replaced by one of anger and
concern at what one sees is happening in England, with patients lying in
acute hospital corridors, county councils unable to meet the cost of
nursing elderly people in residential homes, and councils being taken to
court because they are trying to force an elderly lady into a home
rather than keep her in her own home with the necessary 24-hour
community care which is considered too expensive.
We have not yet experienced these appalling situations but there is no
doubt that if the proposed closures are allowed to go through, we will.

DID the teachers who educated Michael Toner find it was really hard
work (March 8)?
Why does he suggest teachers are not ''real workers''? What is his
definition of such workers?
Wasn't it parents of the pupils driving to and from schools who were
said to be causing a nuisance to all these other poor people who just
have to drive themselves to and from work?
It is time factories and offices arranged buses to pick up their
workers and to have staggered hours.

I HAVE no wish to perpetuate my differences with Dr J Duncan (March
7). He has, however, accused me of making a political statement aimed at
discrediting the Government.
I was careful to avoid making any such statements. If he will read my
article again he will note that my statements were based on scientific
fact and on more than one occasion I indicated the need for all parties
to reconsider their policies in the light of research evidence linking
poverty with ill health.
I have no sense that politicians in general have a good grasp of the
issues involved in this debate. There is no reason why they should. Up
until now it has been seen by the public health community as a subject
for academic study rather than political pragmatism.
I believe it is time to stop describing the relationship between
poverty and ill health and start formulating plans to tackle it.
There is every reason for the present Government to see this issue as
an opportunity rather than a threat. Improving opportunities for
education, increasing self-reliance, and allowing communities to take
control of their own development are consistent with the principle of
subsidiarity to which the Government has subscribed as part of its
membership of the European Union.
There is good reason to believe that genuine investment in such
principles would bring health benefit. Equally there is evidence to
suggest that redistribution of wealth to the poor will also have health
benefits.
It is not for me to advocate either policy. I must, however, ensure
that the issue is on the political agenda. The electorate must then
decide if the response of political parties has been adequate.
Natural justice suggests we should be concerned for those who, by
force of circumstances, are in difficulty and unable to help themselves.
We must also be determined in ensuring that all members of our community
have the opportunity to live fulfilling, productive lives. I think,
however, they remain important to the people of Glasgow.

AS an ex-pupil of Portree High School, I remember the Nissen huts
arriving in the sixties (March 3). They were temporary then.
It's a disgrace that they're still being used. The carbuncle of a
school that later replaced the old stone building is a similar disgrace.
It goes on. When the school was built an assembly hall was guaranteed.
It has never arrived. The present buildings are nothing more than the
initial phases of a complex that has never been completed.
Highland Regional Council has failed miserably to provide Portree and
Skye with the school it deserves. The only option that's credible is a
new school on a greenfield site. The generations of Skye men and women
who have received from Portree High School the most significant
privilege of all -- their education -- will demand nothing less.

FREEDOM to voice one's opinions will always be permissible in a
democratic country, and John Linklater certainly voiced his in Weekender
(February 25).
Most was written, he might say, ''tongue in cheek''. But my tongue was
rendered almost speechless in dismay after reading his highly offensive,
nay blasphemous, remarks on the Christian God, my God. John Linklater
took the liberty of referring to God as a ''rotten general'', as the
Maker who ''didn't exactly practise what is preached in His name'', as a
God who ''moved in mysterious ways when he created an imperfect world'',
etc. All his biblical references were used out of context and referred
to only in the most sneering and mordant manner.
I cannot say for certain, although I do have my theories, how it came
to be that John Linklater achieved such a chip on his shoulder with
regards to a God who evidently he does not know personally, yet with
whom he feels he has an acquaintance.
This I do believe. The God which he has denigrated so caustically has
said most clearly in His Word, ''How long, ye simple ones, will ye love
simplicity, and the scorners delight in their scorning? . . . Because I
have called and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand and no man
regarded, but ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would have none
of my reproof. I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your
fear cometh'' (Proverbs ch 1).

IN connection with your report, Legal aid bill on child case could be
#2m, the comments of George Foulkes, MP, are somewhat misplaced and
misguided (March 8).
The board must first approve the appointment of an advocate, whose
fees, like those of the instructing solicitor, are subject to
predetermined rates and whose accounts are subject to the utmost
scrutiny. There is no open-end commitment to fund lawyers' fees.
The Ayr case is unique, raising matters of utmost importance involving
several children, several sets of parents, miscarriages of justice, and
it was conducted over several years. It must be recognised that the Ayr
case is the exception. I could not think of a more deserving set of
individuals to receive the benefits of legal aid and proper legal
advice.
On average, the cost per civil case for non-court work is #131.57 and
the cost per civil case in court is #840. By any standard this
represents exceptional value for money.
Any debate on the availability of legal aid and lawyers' fees should
take account of the normal and not simply be sensationalised by the
exception.

STRAY thoughts that nothing much changes in journalism are the pale
fruit of a few fevered nights in bed with Heywood Broun . . . Perhaps it
would be better to begin in another way.
From the big, fit world to the sickroom came tidings of the renewal of
a golden age of newspaper scribbling. The renascence centre was New
York. For its most purple period the patch extended between the two
world wars. Its most colourful name was the odd-looking one of Broun.
Also odd is how, although Heywood Broun was the shiniest star in the
firmament of his times, he is little mentioned in the revival of
interest in some of his chums.
At cinemas now is a film about Dorothy Parker, poet, wit, and critic,
who was a high priestess of the Broun admiration society. In the picture
a main part is about Robert Benchley, another of his pals.
Meanwhile in bookshops -- and given solemn amounts of space on review
pages --is a biography of Walter Winchell, digger of dirt along old
Broadway. He was just another fan of Broun.
Winchell's way of working was to sit nightly in the Stork Club, while
tributes of bits of gossip were laid at his feet. But it was Heywood
Broun, after an assiduous apprenticeship in speakeasies, who made the
Stork Club a fashionable enough address for Winchell to favour.
When Broun became stricken with the notion to be elected a
congressman, Winchell cemented together his newspaper column by layering
the slogan Vote for Broun between each titbit item.
And (to have done with comparing the man with his contemporaries) when
young Broun reported baseball games, sharing the press benches was one
Damon Runyon, who was reckoned less readable.
It will be tough to take if Heywood Broun misses his share of the fond
glow that is being put on his set. It will be tough anyway.
Investigative thoroughness this week demands close attendance on the
Parker picture for the fine chance that he is treated in it at his
weight. Duty also calls for some dips into the Winchell book. At #20 a
shot, however, they are likely to be quick dips.
By comparison, boning up on Broun is an easy swot. No portions of his
prodigious output come readily to hand. Yet he did novels, political
tracts, and not just newspaper columns, although he did six of them a
week.
Most of what's available for a Broun study lies in the bric-a-brac of
other people's biographies and memoirs. His life and work come reflected
through tales about Ring Lardner, Don Marquis, James Thurber, and
Alexander Woollcott as well as Parker and the rest of the revival.
Caught in a rare humble moment, any one of them might have conceded
that Broun had a better way with words.
He had also the fastest. He wrote in even time, clattering out columns
at about the same speed they could be read. With two fingers he worked a
typewriter to the margin of meltdown.
As a bedside comforter he made the best and worst of company. A great
shambling bear of a fellow, he needed an ample mattress. Much of his
library was built into the bedstead. It was his work place. His bedroom
was also his exercise yard. When in athletic mood he jogged gently
between mounds of books on the carpet. First thing most mornings,
usually around noon, he cried out for a gin and bitters.
When you are abed and feeling poorly, however, the problem with having
Broun about was how he believed that any minute his heart would peg out.
How his name lives on -- however faintly compared with D Parker's and
W Winchell's -- is for his invention in newspapers of the personal
column that expressed opinions different from those of the proprietors.
His success was not always serene. Heywood Broun starred on four papers,
from three of which he was fired.
His longest run was on the New York World, a Pulitzer paper, where his
It Seems to Me column first appeared in 1921. Then as now (since nothing
fresh in newspapers is ever new) the central regions of the livelier
sheets featured a colonnade of columns. On the page opposite its
editorials the World had six, sometimes seven, namely scriveners
alongside Broun.
Getting his name in the papers gave him a problem. Even devoted
followers wanted to correct it to Brown. Only respect for his parents,
who were rather grand, stopped his changing the spelling to Broon. No
way would his first wife, Ruth Hale, use the handle at all, but for her
own reasons.
Women's rights (also then as now, and especially last week) were a
newspaper rage. Heywood Broun had flaming feminism at home. Ruth Hale
belonged to a league of progressive ladies who refused to take their
husbands' names but insisted on keeping their own -- that is, their
fathers' -- names. They went on about it a lot. Never mind in the
papers, not much changes anywhere.
One family idea Ruth Hale had was to buy a farm. She set the style
among New York's colony of columnists to become rural landlords. Many of
them were lushly enough paid to be weekend lairds. One of them even
bought an island. Some things in the business are not the same.

There is one big failing that
women -- particularly Scottish
women -- must guard against if
they are ever to win major
advances in the war against
breast cancer -- their innate
tendency to suffer in silence.
Kirsty Scott examines the battle
plans that must be adopted
IN THE end, it may be the anger that starts saving lives. It was anger
that drove Audrey Jones to set up the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign;
anger at the lack of money which hampered the doctors who saved her
life; anger that seven women die daily across Scotland from the disease;
anger that all Scottish women do not have access to the best treatment
available.
Jones, 63, had lost eight relatives to the disease when she herself
was diagnosed in 1992. She received almost textbook care in Edinburgh
with understanding doctors, a specialist nurse for counselling and a
surgeon prepared to consider, and effect, her own chosen alternative to
mastectomy.
As her own treatment progressed, however, she became aware that others
had not been as lucky.
''There was one young girl I spoke to who had a biopsy. She was sent
to a general hospital where she went in with the varicose veins. They
sat her down, told her it was malignant, that they would get her a bed
when one became free and her breast would be taken off. Then she had to
go home.
''I started to realise that everybody didn't have access to
counselling centres and specialists. I found out we have the highest
death rate in Europe and the lowest funding.''
The generally accepted figure for the UK is that one in 12 women will
develop breast cancer each year; in Scotland the figure is one in 14. It
is the single biggest killer for women between the ages of 35 and 54.
It is also generally acknowledged that there is a marked unevenness in
treatment across the nation. The SBCC estimate that in Scotland some 60%
of women with the disease are being treated by general surgeons in
general units, and not in specialist centres.
The eminent breast cancer specialist Professor Karol Sikora, from
Hammersmith Hospital, describes a British woman's chance of surviving
the disease as a ''cruel lottery''. He has estimated that it would cost
#100m a year to double the number of specialists, provide an extra 300
breast-care nurses and purchase additional equipment, but argues that a
commitment must be made nationally, and the money must be found to give
British women the standard of treatment other countries take for
granted.
At the moment, in the UK, charities provide most of the money for
research into the disease and put their funds into specialist units and
personnel. Between 1991 and 1992 the Government spent #1.6m through the
Medical Research Council on breast cancer and #15.9m on Aids research.
During the same period, 15,306 women died from breast cancer and 70 died
from Aids.
Last year, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund alone spent #5m on breast
cancer prevention cure and treatment. During roughly the same period the
MRC spent #3.1m on breast cancer research.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said a proportion of that #3.1m
was spent in Scotland, and since 1985 the Chief Scientists Office has
funded 21 breast cancer projects at a total cost of #1.3m. On top of
that the Scottish Cancer Therapy Network received a #3.1m grant over
five years from the Government.
The spokesman dismissed accusations that the Government has taken a
piecemeal approach to the disease, and pointed to the national screening
programme as an example of its commitment to tackling it. ''We take a
very serious view of the importance of breast screening. There is a lot
of research ongoing. We take a very serious view of cancers of all kinds
and we are doing a great deal of work in the field.''
Breast cancer campaigners, however, say funding research must not be
allowed to take precedence over funding of treatment. ''You will find
there is more being spent on research than on treatment management. That
is the sad thing, really,'' said a spokeswoman for Breast Cancer Care in
London. ''Things are being thrown up by research that need to be
addressed in the way cancer is being managed. In the UK it's a
lottery.''
To try to reduce the lottery effect, the Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund
recently launched Britain's first directory of breast cancer services,
indicating those units which have the most experience and the most
specialists in treating cancer. It's been argued that 4000 lives a year
could be saved if all women were given the best possible treatment.
British campaigners, meanwhile, have been looking to America as an
example of how to demand and get the best possible research and
treatment for the disease. In the past five years, American breast
cancer activists have staged a massive public campaign and secured the
support and financial backing of the Government.
The National Breast Cancer Coalition started with a letter-writing
scheme and a petition, won the support of eminent scientists and made
important friends in Congress. With the help of one Senator who had lost
two sisters to breast cancer, they managed to divert $210m for breast
cancer research from the US Army budget; and initiated a national action
plan which was endorsed by President Clinton. At the same time, the
National Cancer Institute's budget was boosted from $133m to $197m,
giving breast cancer more government funding than any other form of the
disease.
The victory for US activists has given the Scottish campaigners heart,
but they believe they have a tough struggle ahead.
Last month, a delegation from the SBCC travelled from Scotland to
London to hand in a petition with 150,000 signatures to the Prime
Minister. The document called for a personal commitment by John Major to
find resources for a national programme for improved survival, better
treatments and a co-ordinated system of research.
The women on the train included a 45-year-old mother of two who
collected 10,000 signatures on the streets of Glasgow while she was
undergoing chemotherapy, and a young woman who postponed a hospital
appointment and dosed herself up with painkillers to take part.
Jones believes their reception in London was a particularly telling
one. They were met at the door of Downing Street by a member of staff.
''He told us that John Major had been at a ball the night before and
had got in late. I thought, there are girls on that train who are going
to die. These women made the effort to come down to London and he can't
come out and see us.''
However, Audrey Jones acknowledges that part of the problem is that
women have remained too stoical about their own health issues. ''When my
aunts had it they would whisper: 'Mrs So and So has breast cancer.' Had
it been men with penis cancer they would have made such a noise about
it. I think it's because women sit quiet, accept and suffer. We go
through absolute torture giving birth. Women get embarrassed. They don't
like to talk about it.
''The only way we are going to get treatment is to scream from the
rooftops: I have breast cancer and I have a rotten high chance of dying
from it!''
Stoicism, according to British doctor Cathy Read, is the one trait
British, and particularly Scottish, women must discard if they are to
win the fight for greater understanding of the disease.
Read is the author of a new book: Breast Cancer -- The Politics of an
Epidemic, which will be published by Pandora next month. It will
undoubtedly be a controversial text. In it, Read argues that women have
been disempowered by breast cancer; that the disease has been kept
hidden and unexplored by a patriarchal society; and that there has been
a subconscious tendency to blame women for bringing it on themselves by
their lifestyle choices.
Only a few decades ago, she argues, breast cancer was hardly ever
talked about and images of mastectomy were rare. The pressure was on
women to keep quiet about the disease and to cover up and look good if
they had undergone surgery. Now, a powerful wave of anger is bringing
the disease into the open and women are less willing to hide their
scars.
Speaking from San Francisco, Read said: ''I think on the whole
American women are more vocal. I see British women as a bit more
stoical, particularly so Scottish women. More reserved and more likely
to trust their doctors and put up with it.''
Conscious of the conflicting advice about the possible factors which
contribute to the disease, Read has amassed the latest scientific
thinking and argues that the focus must be on prevention. Her
conclusions call for fundamental changes in the way we eat, our
child-bearing, the environment, use of pesticides and other pollutants,
and the attitude to exercise.
The onus to better understand the disease, however, is just as much on
the policymakers as on individual women, and public health education is
the simplest and first step. Speaking from San Francisco, she said:
''Just because something about the way we live causes cancer does not
mean we are to blame. The solutions lie as much in the offices of
Brussels, Washington and Westminster as they do at the kitchen table.
''Breast cancer has disempowered women, but women are no longer
powerless against it. They want something to be done about breast cancer
and they are making their voices heard loud and clear. It is time
governments and policy-makers at every level considered safe measures to
prevent it.''
For Audrey Jones, the situation will only change when more and more
women and those affected by breast cancer fight to keep their voices
heard and the issue at the forefront of public life. At the moment, the
SBCC is looking at ways of expanding its work south of the Border, and
is hoping to meet Scottish Office Health Minister Lord Fraser later this
month.
''Women must keep the pressure on their local MPs and keep it up the
whole time,'' she said. ''We have to fight to make this an enormous
issue, because in the end we are fighting for our lives.''
* THERE are a variety of services available for people affected by
breast cancer, from information to counselling and advice:
CANCERLINK is an Edinburgh-based charity which runs an information
service for all types of cancer, including breast cancer. Officials say
they can answer any query on the topic, but do not offer counselling as
such. Their helpline is open between 9.30am and 5pm Monday to Friday on
0800-132905.
BREAST CANCER CARE is a London-based organisation which has offices in
Edinburgh (031-221-0407) and Glasgow (041-353-1050). It offers advice,
information and counselling on all aspects of the disease. Call free on
0500-245345.
BACUP, the British Association of Cancer United Patients, has recently
opened a counselling service in Scotland. It can be contacted on Monday
to Friday between 9am and 5.30pm on 041-553 1553. It operates a
Freephone number on Monday to Thursday between 10am and 7pm, and on
Friday between 10am and 5.30pm on 0800-181199.
TAK TENT runs a drop-in centre in University Avenue in Glasgow,
opposite the Boyd Orr building. It offers a counselling and information
service for all types of cancer. Call 041-211-1932 between 10am and 3pm.
THE SCOTTISH BREAST CANCER CAMPAIGN can be contacted at PO Box 12202,
Edinburgh EH4 1ZX.
* Checklists compiled by leading cancer charities suggest you should
ask for the following:
1. Rapid referral to a team specialising in the diagnosis and
treatment of breast cancer.
2. A firm diagnosis within four weeks of referral.
3. A second opinion if, after full discussiom with your consultant and
GP, you are not happy about the proposed treatment.
4. Full information about the types of surgery and treatments,
together with details about their side-effects.
5. Adequate time to consider the options.
6. Access to a specialist breast care nurse, and to a qualified breast
prosthesis fitting service.
7. The opportunity to meet a former breast cancer patient, trained to
give support.

A WATERY solution for the problems of Loch Lomond was unveiled
yesterday and although it may not sink, neither is it likely to float
with pride. The Scottish Office was faced with an admittedly difficult
problem. Polluted, bedevilled by varieties of high-powered engines
driven by occasionally low-powered intellects, and managed (if that word
could be used) by two regions and two district councils, Loch Lomond
seemed destined to collapse under the weight of its own popularity.
Something had to be done, but defining something is never easy,
especially when the only solutions are likely to be complex ones. The
suggestion of turning the area into a National Park was considered and
rejected. There are 11 National Parks in England and Wales, all of them
suffering from a variety of problems and at least one (the Lake District
National Park) in danger of financial ruin. The Government believes
National Parks can work well in some countries but is unconvinced that
they can work in Britain. This is perfectly correct, at least as long as
central government persists in cutting vital funding. While nobody
denies mistakes have been made in the Lake District, the radical cuts
which the managers face over the next three years seem destined only to
cause more problems. National Park status, which would have made good
sense for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs area, has, therefore, been
rejected and the heavy footprints of the Treasury are to be seen on the
shoreline.
What has been proposed instead has only one great merit; it is not a
quango. Heavily diluted by-laws have been formulated which will allow
those with a taste for speed to disport themselves over most of the loch
untrammelled. The rules and regulations will be administered by a
committee of local councillors and experts drawn from the district
authorities of Stirling, Dumbarton, and Argyll and Bute. It is at this
point that symptoms of light-headedness bordering on hysteria can be
seen in those familiar with the workings of the current versions of
these district councils. Each has its own political flavour, to put the
matter at its mildest. Each has its own agenda which differs from the
concerns of the others and each is likely, for the reasons given above
and because of geography, to consider the problems of Loch Lomond to be
peripheral to its main concerns. None of them is likely to agree with
each other and the new joint committee stands every chance of becoming a
rich source of material for those expert in conflict studies. It is
difficult, in short, to conceive of any formulation worse suited than
this one to give a clear lead and a comprehensive and integrated
strategy for the management of such an important asset.
Two further problems present themselves, and both are linked to the
Government's increasing fondness for lumping all problems which it does
not understand or is disinclined to fund into the hands of local
authorities. Funding will be available for the setting-up of the new
joint authority. The sum involved is #2.85m over the next three years.
Anything with millions in it sounds good, but divide it by three and the
figures look less impressive. For all that, it will probably be
adequate, but after the first three years there are no plans for funding
and it is at this point that the new local authorities will find
themselves faced with more bills which can properly be argued to be at
least partly the responsibility of central government. The
reorganisation of local government will also present the new joint
committee with increased problems, but most significantly, if the
members of the joint committee cannot agree among themselves there are
no plans, and no powers, for the Scottish Office to use to force them to
be sensible. It is possible that this raw affair will work, but it will
require a spirit of co-operation and inventiveness not seen thus far on
the bonnie banks.

LABOUR'S new Clause 4 is more verbose and bland than its predecessor,
and the fact is that little in it would put off either a Liberal or a
Conservative, apart from the initial and crisp declaration that ''Labour
is a democratic socialist party''. Whether the rest actually adds very
much will be debated, but at least it is now beyond doubt that Labour
does not intend widespread re-nationalisation of public corporations,
though there is plenty of scope for additional regulatory powers. The
party is still the broad church it always has been but this aspect of
its identity has never been so clearly expressed, though any far-left
dimension is really ruled out firmly and clearly. Mr Blair said
yesterday that the debate to rewrite the clause had attracted many new
party members. What has emerged should cost few, since it is hard to see
where they might go. Labour has indeed, though in ways never intended by
those who first used the phrase, ''no enemies on the left''.
The possibility of Labour adopting a pacifist or isolationist foreign
or defence policy is ruled out as well, positions which in the 1960s,
and even as late as the end of the 1970s, absorbed immense amounts of
the party's energy, much as the arguments about the EU now take up so
much Tory effort. If matters like that are treated firmly, others
attract a more delicate approach, notably unemployment. Labour would
still want, obviously, to try for as much employment as possible but the
experience of the country since the Heath and Callaghan administrations
(not to mention that of our continental partners in the past few years)
warns that full employment is simply not in the gift of governments.
This is implicitly recognised, and although the passage on economic
affairs uses old Labour language like partnership and co-operation, the
acceptance of a market economy is not fudged. The new clause does
proclaim a new Labour, and it is bound to enhance the party's appeal.
The whole process, which involved much internal consultation and whose
outcome has still to be ratified at the end of April, involved Mr Blair
in a gamble. That he would win it was not entirely self-evident, except
possibly now in retrospect. A hostile commentator might say that he
blackmailed the party, but more objectively it must seem that he led it.
Franklin Roosevelt was wont to say of some of his own difficulties that
a politician can seldom afford to be ahead of opinion, though he must be
up with its leading edge. Attempts to reform Labour's theoretical
position go back to the 1950s, but these failed so comprehensively that
even the party's last leader did not think the battle worth beginning.
Mr Blair has proved him wrong. And he did take a risk, even though
Clause 4 will probably not merit much mention whenever the next General
Election is called.

After decades spent in the full glare of public curiosity, Elizabeth
Taylor is furious about intrusion into her private life in a new TV
series.
Douglas Thompson reports that other stars may share her discomfiture
as their lives become the TV business of the future.
ELIZABETH Taylor Hilton Wilding Todd Fisher Burton Burton Warner
Fortensky is the star of the Liz Show. It has been running longer than
Coronation Street and the Buckingham Palace frolics. The walk-on
players, like the husbands, flit in and out. The latest instalment has
Liz in a tizz over a television series based on her life. She doesn't
like the idea.
It's not because they are calling it a ''mini'' series -- at certain
times that was an absurd misnomer -- but because she objects to what she
regards as an ''intrusion'' into her life.
There is an argument here but I'm not sure Ms Taylor is the best
advocate for the debate. She's appeared on film with Lassie and Brando
and a host of other four and two legged creatures, she turns up at
shopping malls to promote her association with White Diamonds and
Passion perfumes, which sell from the hype of success and elegance as
much as for the name.
Kitty Kelley's infamous but wonderfully researched book on Taylor's
life was titled The Last Star and that was reasonably accurate. She was
stealing scenes from Lassie when she was 12. That sort of celluloid
felony got somewhat more difficult as she grew older and started working
with people, but nevertheless she has always been a star. And one
celebrated as much for her bourbon capacity and marital record as her
emoting.
Her life is a tabloid headline -- again and again and again it wasn't
the husbands, even Burton, who made the ink run so frenetically but this
short, often dumpy, woman with a three-hour glass figure. She and Burton
co-starred in The Taming of the Shrew and Taylor had been miscast many
times but that, as they say in her adopted Mexican village of Puerto
Vallerta, was the big tamale. Shrew? Tamed? Not at the last encounter.
She is sixtysomething on firecrackers.
Her drink of choice is now ginger ale. She is married to former
construction worker and double-divorcee Larry Fortensky, whom she met in
1988 when they were both recovering from addictions at the Betty Ford
Centre near Palm Springs in the California Desert. Hey, that's a TV
movie of the week in itself. Has anyone told Cilla?
He is 20 years younger. They were married On October 6, 1991, and it
was like Cleopatra marrying Stanley Kowalski on the set of Peter Pan.
The wedding at Michael Jackson's Santa Ynez Valley estate near Santa
Barbara -- the Neverland Valley -- had the bride, now 63, in Valentino,
the groom in Versace and Bubbles the chimp, the ring bearer, looking for
something backless.
But it takes time to get the souffle right. And what sort of encore do
you expect for a woman who can make earrings from the diamonds in her
old engagement rings? This is a TV movie.
An anxious America will see Destiny in six weeks. The ''mini'' series
will be part of the NBC network's ratings ''sweeps'' when all the big
players compete for top advertising dollars. NBC believe Liz will
deliver.
And she has shot herself in her size four shoe. She attemped to have
the television film banned and lost. So now, you've guessed it, it's
''The TV Film Liz Doesn't Want To See.'' She had the same problem with C
David Heymann who wrote a best-selling biography of Jackie Onassis and
was the author of Liz on which Destiny is based. His is ''The Book Liz
Wanted Banned.'' Pass another sales slip.
What is curious is that after all the years, all the headlines and
horrors, the stories of near death and tragedy, of friends like Rock
Hudson dying of AIDS (a cause for which she is an admirable fund
raiser), of friends from James Dean to Michael Jackson, and the husbands
-- Nicky Hilton, Michael Wilding, Mike Todd, Eddie Fisher, Richard
Burton (twice, in 1964 and 1975), American Senator John Warner and the
present husband Larry Fortensky -- that ''intrusion'' would be a
concern. If you've lived the life, do you have to watch it? Or read it?
Taylor (''I don't pretend to be an ordinary housewife'') was
nevertheless seriously upset by Destiny and hired her Armani-clad birds
of prey. Lawyer Neil Papiano gave an instant critique of Destiny with:
''This is ridiculous. You don't have a right to protect yourself from
these vultures?''
The said vultures, the TV producers, went pecking after Taylor's legal
process was chucked out of court. Naughtily, they began filming in
January and the first scenes were at the mansion where Taylor and
Michael Wilding once lived. Producer Lester Persky said that the film
''will go up to the near present because I don't know what's going to
happen tomorrow'' and that all Taylor's husbands will be protrayed. As
will her ''best friend'' Debbie Reynolds, from whom she stole Eddie
Fisher before she dumped him for Burton the first time. Is that another
TV movie?
The one immediately in question stars Sherilyn Fenn and she is nothing
for Taylor to complain about. In one sequence update for the TV film
from Taylor's movie Ivanhoe (which BBC2 Screened last Sunday), the
contrast between the two stars is quite evident. Fenn, aptly and amply
one of the stars of David Lynch's Twin Peaks, more than does justice to
the medieval costumes. She's also quite a ringer for Taylor in a scene
with Rock Hudson (another good lookalike actor in Dan McVican) where he
threatens to throw her in a swimming pool.
Throughout, in the weddings and the movies and the marriages, Sherilyn
Fenn makes Taylor look good.
What has bruised the project is C David Heymann's book in which he
alleges that Taylor was abused by three of her husbands. Hotel heir
Nicky Hilton is said to have beaten her on their honeymoon. Burton is
also said to have got into fisticuffs. And Mike Todd, the extravagant
entrepreneur who died tragically in an air crash in 1958, is described
in an incident in which he ''went for her.''
Lawyers again. Taylor's Neil Papian said: ''The abuse charges are
totally false.'' He says such allegations could cost her millions. She
is selling an image. If that is tarnished so are the gold credit cards.
''Her name,'' he says, ''is all she really has.''
And that may be it.
With cable television and super electronic highways, the paparazzi are
being overtaken by the video piranhas. Taylor, as we said, might not be
the best example but clearly this is the TV business of the future.
She is a glaring subject for the TV biopic. Jack Parr, the one-time
great of late night American TV, said: ''She should get a divorce and
settle down.'' Joan Rivers, a skeleton, on Liz's weight: ''Is she fat?
Her favourite food is seconds.''
Why should a subject of late night TV comics and commentators, of the
tabloid tease, a British-born wartime evacuee -- to Hollywood -- object
to the TV treatment?
Well, would you?
If you take it from a professional standpoint, she isn't getting paid.
Sherilyn Fenn is. The reason for the Taylor movie and many like it is
the shortage of subjects. With the airwaves packed with time, there is
an increasing need for material. Famous names help fill the time slots.
What has changed is that so many of the subjects are living. There are
films on Mia Farrow (Patsy Kensit plays her), Madonna (Terumi Matthews
is the star), O J Simpson (Bobby Hosea and Jessica Tuck play O J and his
murdered wife Nicole), Tyson (Michael Jai White and Kristen Wilson play
Tyson and former wife actress Robin Givens) and there are two TV shots
at Roseanne. In one, Patrikaa Darbo and Stepehn Lee play Roseanne and
Tom Arnold; David Graff and Denny Dillon do the honours on another
network.
Roseanne got upset about some of the casting. She thought Denny Dillon
was ''a freaky little thing...a midget woman.''
Which is what Liz Taylor has spent her life striving either to become
or remain. Chiefly, she survives. And, from the photographs so far
available, Sherilyn Fenn is not doing anything untoward to her image.
Oh, there is one thing. Fenn never keeps anyone waiting. Which plays
games with director Mike Nichols, who classically said. 'There are three
things I never saw Elizabeth Taylor do. Tell a lie; be unkind to anyone:
and be on time.'
The Last Star?
She's beaten the clock.

MARCELLA EVARISTI is convinced that the trials endured at Lent
inevitably lead to greater excess.
I WAS wondering whether Catholic children still give things up for
Lent. When I was small, it was a matter of heated pre-Lent debate. Most
just plumped for sweetie-denial -- weeks of tuckshop avoidance followed
by a binge of chocolate eggs come Easter. Jesuitical analysis of what
constituted ''sweets'' came into play. Crisps (except bacon flavoured on
a Friday) seemed clearly exempt, but what about biscuits which included
toffee? Was swopping a Twix for a Crunchie bar true self-denial?
If you opted for a more abstract sacrifice, the moral dilemmas still
hovered above the good intention. ''I will get up at 5.30 and go to Mass
before school every day.'' (And sit beside dishy Gerard Thingmy and
fervently pray that he's not, with those cheekbones, seriously
considering the priesthood . . . )
Like the masochist who liked taking cold showers, so took hot ones,
the self-denier is not always straightforwardly selfless. But, apart
from those silver linings of sacrifice which complicate our desire to be
better people, what should be surrendered? At convent school we were
always given a little Lenten introductory lecture to help us decide, in
case, like a junkie giving up macrame, we plumped for easy options.
Since, in these secular times, there is no Sister Resista to guide us
into flawlessness, I would like to offer some suggestions as to who
might give up what.
Stephen Fry should seriously consider giving up celibacy. (Apart from
anything, it is always unwise to publicly declare the precise nature of
your sexuality, the stability of your marriage or the wondrousness of
your Significant Other. What has been optimistically written in stone,
can be broken up and hurled).
Repulsed by the notion of a bidie-in, and disgusted by the squelchy,
leaky business of coitus, Fry prolifically embraced the Significant Out
There, and addressed his sweet nothings to the world: his Curriculum
Vitae became a St Valentine's card addressed to the general.
When he finally sickened of the relationship and bolted, the actor's
departure became headline news, with sympathy and sneers jostling for
space. Like the wronged wives of adulterous politicians, some of his
spurned public offered understanding (''All is forgiven, you big,
brilliant silly.''), while others aggressively took the huff and dubbed
him Garbo.
Had he been involved in a celebrity-normal relationship, his
self-imposed work pressures would have simply led to a lovers' break-up,
same as everyone else in his position. His ex-partner could have sold
the story to the tabloids (''I was Jilted for the Groucho Club'') and
the news of the separation would have distracted attention from the
reviews of his performance in Cell Mates. In a few months time, he could
have been interviewed for that How We Met feature, photographed beside
his new paramour, who could reveal in detail how much Stephen needed
shielding from the media's prurient attention.
The Queen might give some thought to giving up her PR man. Your
Majesty, he is leading you in the wrong direction. Ditch that suburban
image of a hard working lady, too busy for stylishness, stoically
clutching on to that dated handbag of duty and responsibility. The
notion of monarchy is marching its way out of history, and your family
are leading the band. Loyalty has shrunk to fondness for you, so why
continue with this pretence of being (a very special) one of us? You
should be having a patrician ball as the opinion polls burn into the
royal consciousness.
Why not go decadent, bad-mouth the proles, become Snow White's
step-mother in black velvet, stop wearing your specs with that crown (it
really doesn't work). Order a woodcutter to cut out the hearts of your
anarchist enemies, imprison your hairdresser, terrorise your minions.
You've tried the other tack, and look where it's led. Remember the royal
families of Europe, with their supermarket expeditions and bicycles.
Remember your true breeding and spit in the republican's eye, because if
you continue believing the carriage will roll on for ever, your innocent
Hartnell-gloved hand will not be waving but, with due respect, drowning.
My Lenten advice to Jo Brand is that she should resist the notion that
girth is mirth. (Her expression always seems so stuck: that exaggerated
exasperation, with eyes rolling heavenwards and the sardonic drawl
exactly captures the response of a 14-year-old told to tidy her room).
There is always the underlying suggestion that finding her unfunny is
somehow shapist: but rather than her humour liberating people's attitude
to fatness and their bodies, her observations seem to stem from a
neurotic defensiveness about herself. And though neurosis is a great
source of the comedic, her relentless equation of slim with bimbo and
fat with feminist clarity deserves to be liposucked.
But although Brand would do well to consider giving up the cream cakes
for Lent (at least), it is generally accepted that dieting does not
work. In fact, giving up anything rarely works. People have an amazing
capacity for transference. Consider the proud ex-cigarette smoker on 30
cheroots a day.
Perhaps we should blame the Easter eggs. When we convent school girls
were piously resisting the puff candy and soor plooms, we knew that in a
matter of weeks we would be parentally indulged with a feast of those
curved and gleaming dark brown eggs. What a poor pattern for
self-improvement then -- after the finite famine, the fabulous feast.
Thus, self-denial inexorably leads to even greater excess. So binge
away, Ms Brand, sleep alone still, Mr Fry, and, your Majesty, wave on.
And I shall give up giving advice until . . . when is Easter this
year?

THE atmosphere in the Commons yesterday was distinctly Elizabethan.
Give or take a few details of costume and the presence of some lady
Members, it could have been March 1588.
The House has been at boiling point about the depredations of the Dons
before, their unreasonable demands, their contempt for fair play, their
tiny meshed nets, and now fresh news had come down to Her Majesty's
Loyal Commons that the Armada had set sail again, this time for the
fabled fisheries of the New World.
Of course, the sixteenth-century Armada had not got closer to the
Newfoundland fishing grounds than Ireland. However, the
twentieth-century version had made it across the Atlantic and were
catching halibut as if there were no tomorrow, on the basis that if
there were there would be no halibut left.
What were once the Elizabethan Newfoundland fisheries are now run by
Canadians, who had clapped a Spanish vessel in irons.
The normally analytical Mr Peter Shore almost spluttered with anger at
the bellicose statements which had subsequently poured from European
Union spokespersons. Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino had accused the
Canadians of ''organised piracy'' while the EU ambassadors had said they
''would reserve their right to take any action which they deem
appropriate.''
As the Spaniards already had sent a gunboat, did that mean the Royal
Navy might be lining up with them to drive out the Canadians, demanded
Mr Shore, raising Britain's many links with Canada, which include
sharing the same Queen.
In the absence of Sir Francis Drake, Sir Teddy Taylor was next to
speak for England, demanding that the Government refuse to join in any
trade sanctions the EU might order against Canada.
It is a measure of the antipathy Spanish fishing practices arouse that
even the Canadians -- one of the most politically correct nations on
earth, with a record of international good works and peacekeeping
missions as long as your arm -- have decided they have had enough and
resorted to (a) force and (b) what appears to be illegality.
Canada produces Mounties, fine fishing rivers, skiers, lots of wheat
and are generally regarded as ''good eggs''. The Spaniards are, let us
say, not regarded in the same light.
The Canadians, Sir Teddy reminded us, ''have never let us down in our
times of peril''. The Spaniards' last opportunity to stand by us was the
Peninsula War when they drove Wellington mad by their inability to
arrive anywhere on time.
Even the Liberal Democrats felt it would not be illiberal to side with
Canada, Mr Paul Tyler (North Cornwall), recalling Spain's ''acts of
piracy'' against Cornish fishermen last summer.
Even the spokeswomen of the Scottish government in exile, Mrs Margaret
Ewing, matched Signora Bonino for bellicosity. ''Stop talking about
playing by the rules'' she snapped. Instead, ensure our fishermen are
not sold out to the Spaniards.
The Commons mood seemed to demand a visitation from the Virgin Queen
or, at any rate, Lady Thatcher, whose inclination, one suspects, would
be to send in the Navy to give the Candadians a hand.
Instead, we had Mr Michael Jack, the knowledgeable but over-loquacious
Fisheries Minister. He confessed to having ''some sympathy'' with our
Canadian kith and kin, and even suggested that Signora Bonina's strong
words were only to be expected when an Italian Commissioner came to the
aid of the Spanish.
However, he warned that ''precipitate action on the high seas'' would
not resolve the matter, a sentiment which would have cut little ice with
Messrs. Hawkins, Frobisher and Raleigh.
He reminded the excited House that the UK has no vessels in the
disputed area and is not directly involved. He also made it clear that
Ministers are appalled at the thought that they might be asked
(required?) to take action against the Canadians. Britain is, therefore,
''actively encouraging intense diplomatic efforts,'' including ''quiet
diplomacy'' on our part.
This had better work, for both sides of the House made it clear they
believe that Spain is at its old game of invoking rules it then refuses
to play by and just as clear that if the Government were weak-kneed
enough to attempt action against Canada the House of Commons would tell
it not to and the ''halibut question'' could become as famous as the
West Lothian one.

WHEN Kathlyn Hamilton discovered the implications for her of the
breast cancer that ran in her family, she didn't wait for the disease to
catch up with her.
A West Lothian nurse, Mrs Hamilton, 44, is married with two sons aged
10 and 11, and looks after young chronically sick patients.
Last year, after she had pleaded for five years with doctors, mostly
male, a female surgeon agreed to remove both her apparently healthy
breasts. She had nursed her mother for six years as she died from breast
cancer, and her mother before her had suffered from the disease.
''My mum was ill from the age of 51 to 57. We stuck together, it was
not all doom and gloom, but I did not want my kids to go through what I
had.
''When my mother found her lump she was operated on within three
weeks. They took the whole breast off, but it had spread to her spine.
It was just a matter of waiting.
''I got a screen because of the family history. I was told I had a one
in four chance of getting it but, according to the way you feel, it is
just a matter of when rather than if.
''Since having the operation I have never thought about breast cancer
except in the context of other people getting it. I haven't had it and I
haven't had the fear of having it, or of going through surgery,
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and then wondering if it would come back.
''All I have had is a simple operation to remove two objects from my
body. Your breasts are just two bits of fat, but when you have this fear
they are two time bombs.
''The spread of the disease is what would scare me. My mother's lump
was only three centimetres, so it was not big -- you would not have
thought it would have spread so far.''
Mrs Hamilton had her operation in August last year in the Western
General. She had to put in writing, without emotion, why it was best
that she should have it done. She received psychological counselling and
her husband, James, had to be interviewed.
''My husband was okay about it and so were the boys. What is the point
in having a mother who has everything, but is dying? ''My husband would
rather have me, without my breasts, than have me die from breast cancer.
He knows what it is like, he helped me to nurse my mother.
''The surgeon made the incision in a very neat V from my armpit down
to my breast-bone. I could still wear an off-the-shoulder dress. The
outside skin is still there although the nipples have gone, and there is
a wee bit of loose skin under my arms, so that I can raise them.
''For the first eight weeks I wondered what I had done. I was sore and
shell-shocked. But I have absolutely no regrets -- I would do it again.
''I have already fed my children. The rest is all image and I have my
own image of myself. I wear fillers to go out to work or elsewhere. We
have nicknamed them my jellyfish, and I feel quite normal in them.''

THE Government is trying to hide up to one million genuine jobless
claimants by doctoring the way in which the national unemployment
statistics are calculated, Shadow Employment Minister Kevin Barron
claimed yesterday.
Labour insists that a move to omit figures showing the number of
people out of work as a percentage of employees, is the 35th major
change in the method of compiling jobs' records since the Conservatives
came to power in 1979.
Mr Barron is also claiming that two more alterations are planned
between the end of April this year and April, 1996, in a move which
would eliminate a further 290,000 people from the public domain and help
to make the statistics look more acceptable.
He said last night: ''All of these measures are aimed at obscuring
public awareness of the real extent of the unemployment problem. More
information is better than less in everyone's eyes except those of
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo.
''He believes that the less information the public has, the more
likely it is that they will believe the Government's hollow claims on
the country's economic recovery.''
In a letter to Mr Portillo, Mr Barron says: ''Information on the
number of people without work has become less and less accessible, and
the real situation more and more obscured by constant tampering with the
statistics.
''As has so often been the trend with these changes, the figures to be
abolished show higher rates of unemployment than those left for
publication. This is yet another example of your department shrinking
the sources of information available to the public.''

THE Government yesterday launched a drive to stamp out prescription
fraud, which deprives the health service of #30m each year.
The money lost would be enough to provide 7000 hip replacements,
20,000 cataract operations or 3000 heart valve operations, Health
Minister of Gerry Malone said.
He announced in a Commons written reply that, from April 1, patients
would have to complete a specific declaration on the back of the
prescription form, giving the precise grounds for their entitlement to
free prescriptions.
To prevent any unscrupulous chemists charging the NHS for
prescriptions that had been paid for, patients would have to state much
they had paid.
Mr Malone said: ''I have been concerned for some time to put an end to
fraud and abuse in the NHS, and I am determined to stamp out
prescription fraud which currently deprives the NHS of around #30m a
year.''
Six million new forms have been printed so far. However, Mr Malone
said there would be no statutory powers requiring the new declarations
to be filled in before consultations were completed this summer.
He appealed for co-operation from doctors and dentists to ensure the
new-style forms had the maximum effect.

BRITISH firms were warned by the Government yesterday against joining
any attempt to break United Nations sanctions against Iraq, amid reports
of other states trading with Baghdad.
Trade and Industry Minister of State Earl Ferrers said at Question
Time: ''There are those people and sometimes those countries who try to
seek a way around a regulation in order to try to benefit themselves
momentarily and personally. I deplore that totally.
''It's up to each country to enforce UN sanctions as best they can
and, as far as I know, they are all doing it correctly.''
Labour's Lord Haskel had spoken of ''pressure on some UK companies to
engage in sanctions-busting on the grounds that, if we don't trade with
Iraq, other firms and other countries will get in first''.

<HEADLINE>Heseltine and Major 'split on executive pay'</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine resisted a demand
from the Prime Minister to conduct a fact-finding exercise on executive
pay, according to a leaked letter obtained by Labour.
The letter, from Mr Heseltine's private secretary Rachel Jenkinson,
said he was ''loath'' to inquire into the pay and share options of the
directors of the privatised utlities as Mr Major had asked.
The letter was seized upon by Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Jack
Cunningham in the Commons last night as proof that Mr Heseltine did not
support the Prime Minister's attempts to curb boardroom excesses.
To furious Tory cries of ''Who did you steal that from?'', Dr
Cunningham brandished a copy and told the House: ''What this shows is
that these self-awarded bonuses and share options, unattached to any
performance, are a matter of fact under this Government.''
Turning to Mr Heseltine, he added: ''The reality is that you intend to
do nothing about it. So be it -- the public will make their own
judgment.''
Labour later produced an accompanying memorandum, sent with the
letter, warning there could be more ''causes celebres'' -- high-profile
cases of execessive pay awards -- later in the year.
Twelve regional electricity companies, which produce their accounts in
June and July, were seen as a particular cause of concern.
In the letter, sent to Mr Major's private secretary Mary Francis, Ms
Jenkinson said there was only limited information published officially
about directors' remuneration in the privatised utilities.
She said Mr Heseltine feared that if he tried to find out more through
unofficial channels, details of what the Government was doing would
quickly leak out.
''Obtaining more information from Stock Exchange sources and direct
approaches to the companies would run the risk of becoming a rather
public exercise, which the President is loath to take,'' she wrote.
The accompanying memorandum said that what information was available
suggested boardroom pay awards would continue to provide embarrassment
for the Government for some time to come.
The memorandum said: ''The results suggest that there are potentially
more causes celebres to be found.''
It sets out a timetable of when some of the major utilities, including
National Power, PowerGen, British Gas, BT, and the water companies,
publish their accounts.
It particularly warns about figures contained in a second document,
not obtained by Labour, relating to the regional electricity companies.
''This suggests that we should expect a good deal of publicity in
June/July.''
The leak comes as a further embarrassment for the Government on an
issue which has proved to be a persistent thorn in Ministers' sides.
It provided further ammunition for Labour to suggest the Cabinet was
not united behind Mr Major in his declared aim to curb boardroom
excesses, by legislation if necessary.
That impression was compounded by Mr Heseltine's own Commons statement
earlier in the evening during the debate on the Gas Bill in which he
strongly defended the pay of British Gas directors.
''British Gas has succeeded in bringing down prices by 20%, which is
#77 for the average domestic customer,'' he told the House.
''So the issue is that if you got rid of all the senior directors, all
the bonuses and all the options, you would save 50p for a board of
directors who have saved customers #77 a year.''
The Gas Bill sets up a framework abolishing the existing British Gas
monopoly of supply for domestic customers and allowing them to choose
their own gas supplier.
Initially, this will only happen in certain areas of the country, on a
pilot scheme basis, but it is intended ultimately to extend it to the
whole of the UK.
Dr Cunningham said the Bill raised many issues of concern, including
right to supply, pricing policy, consumer protection and a possible
threat to the jobs of thousands of British Gas employees.
Mr Heseltine insisted: ''We shall ensure that the requirements for
special services to pensioners, the disabled, the blind and those who
have genuine difficulties in paying should continue,'' he pledged.
At Westminster last night, SNP leader Alex Salmond repeated his pledge
that he and other small shareholders of British Gas would be challenging
the company executive at this year's AGM on its general direction
He said: ''The truth is that the board of British Gas no longer runs
the gas industry in the interests of the public. They run it in their
own interests.''
Labour's amendment, claiming the Bill failed to provide effective
safeguards for consumers against deregulation, and attacking
''unjustified salary and share options awarded to senior employees,''
was defeated by 318 votes to 244, a majority of 74.

LABOUR last night called for cuts in charges after banks reported that
the cost of plastic card fraud fell from #129.8m in 1993 to #96.8m last
year -- saving them #33m.
Shadow Consumer Affars spokesman Nigel Griffiths said the savings
should be immediately be passed back to customers. However, there was
little indication that consumers would see any immediate benefits.
The British Bankers' Association said savings almost certainly would
be spent trying to make cards more secure.
Mr Griffiths said that since part of the fee charged for credit cards
covered the cost of frauds, customers should reap some reward.
He would be asking the Banking Ombudsman and the Department of Trade
and Industry's consumer affairs unit to look at the issue.

SAY what you mean and mean what you say. That, in a reductionist sort
of way, was Tony Blair's explanation for slinging old ideological
baggage into Labour's used luggage rack. The contents of Clause 4 were
worn, frayed at the philosophical edges, and as constricting as a pair
of boned corsets for moving in contemporary social and economic
realities.
Inelegant as it is, straining slightly as it does at the seams, where
the joins are visible, you could argue that the replacement tries to be
all things to all people. You could. You might equally think it sure
beats the sod-the-rest credo which is the alternative and the unwritten
Conservative constitution of the past 15 desperate years.
The case for replacement is perfectly simple and eminently arguable.
First, no sane person, unless they come from the planet Tonto, seriously
expected any foreseeable Labour government to carry out Clause 4 Mark I
to the letter. Even the 1945 government fell a bit short, so why expect
a future one to deliver more?
Democratic socialism was not invented by the Hampstead Set: Sidney and
Beatrice Webb made a brave attempt to articulate the aims of the
movement at the end of a devastating war, and in the shadow of the
Bolshevik revolution. They drafted it with the exploitation and
repression of Victorian coal mines and textile mills still sharp in the
socialist mind.
That was then. This is now.
The single issue of public ownership -- the old Morrisonian state
capitalism -- is simply not enough. There are lots of relationships
between people and the state, all sorts of complex forms, all sorts of
ways that people's lives can be improved. They do not, cannot, depend on
empty shibboleths and calls to nationalise the top 200 monopolies, and
the sweetie shop while you are at it.
Common ownership is important. It was seen in the 1918 version as a
means to an end. It was never an end in itself. Public ownership should
not only mean what Tony Benn or a handful of Stalinist Labour MEPs say
it means. It should have the common good at its heart, rather than
buried in the margins.
Labour has started to answer the question it has agonised over, been
convulsed by, for 40 years. What type of political party is it? A
modern, progressive left-of-centre party based on key values. The
amorphous coalition of various ideas with no coherent whole will not do.
It has, after 15 years -- many of which have been been wasted
indulging in head-butting and name-calling -- to be clear about its
identity. That's why it is important to state the values of social
justice, partnership, equality, and democracy in the new constitution
where they belong.
Labour cannot afford the luxury of being a touch economical with
reality. It cannot afford the kind of posturing that turns politicians
into mouthpieces for every ham, bam or comic singer of a leftist tune.
It can no longer be a party of good losers. Not simply because it will
let itself down. But because it will betray all those who need it, now.
WHAT LABOUR'S NEW CLAUSE FOUR STATES
IV: LABOUR'S AIMS AND VALUES
1. The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that
by the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve
alone so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true
potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and
opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few, where the rights
we enjoy reflect the duties we owe, and where we live together, freely,
in a spirit of solidarity, tolerance and respect.
2. To these ends we work for:
* A dynamic economy, serving the public interest, in which the
enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition are joined with
the forces of partnership and co-operation to produce the wealth the
nation needs and the opportunity for all to work and prosper, with a
thriving private sector and high quality public services, where those
undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public
or accountable to them;
* A just society, which judges its strength by the condition of the
weak as much as the strong, provides security against fear, and justice
at work; which nurtures families, promotes equality of opportunity and
delivers people from the tyranny of poverty, prejudice and the abuse of
power;
* An open democracy, in which government is held to account by the
people; decisions are taken as far as practicable by the communities
they affect; and where fundamental human rights are guaranteed;
* A healthy environment, which we protect, enhance and hold in trust
for future generations.
3. Labour is committed to the defence and security of the British
people, and to co-operating in European institutions, the United
Nations, the Commonwealth and other international bodies to secure
peace, freedom, democracy, economic security and environmental
protection for all.
4. Labour will work in pursuit of these aims with trade unions,
co-operative societies and other affiliated organisations, and also with
voluntary organisations, consumer groups and other representative
bodies.
5. On the basis of these principles, Labour seeks the trust of the
people to govern.

THE Labour Party has declared itself a conservative party. It has, at
long last, recognised that it exists in a new world, the world the rest
of us have been living in for some time now. We may commend the realism,
while marking that realism is a prime Conservative quality.
But Labour also recognises at least one or two important things about
that new world. It manages, not without regret, to tear itself free from
its own traditional structures, just when others have come to see that
no traditional structures are safe from the stupendous transforming
powers of modernity, from the global market, from the instant defusion
of technology and information, from the ceaseless movement of human,
physical and financial capital.
The others who have come to see all that are, as a matter of fact,
mostly Conservatives. In America and Britain, the two countries that
have led the world in political consciousness of those transforming
powers, there is a sense of surcease, of having come to the end of a
phase in which socialism has been slain, bureaucracy has been blighted,
and stateism has been struck dead. Ancient ogres lie lifeless at our
feet.
But Conservatives, knowing all about the old Adam, are not so foolish
as to think that no modern ones will spring up in their place. In fact,
they have already sprung up. Few can feel safe in this new world. So
Conservatives see that nature and tradition need defending, if not yet
by what precise means, though there are plenty of people working on it.
What Tony Blair's aims and values do is come to franker terms with the
deep affinities that the left has to at least some aspects of
Conservative thought. A certain sort of Conservatism was always implicit
in the left's dislike of commerce and innovation, though nobody was
prepared to admit it. In any event, the left had defended nature and
tradition, too.
Such defence, then, cannot be a preserve of the left, nor of the
right, come to that. We treasure things because they appeal to our
morality or feelings, not because of the way we cast our votes. There
is, after all, not much in the aims and values of these democratic
socialists that would turn off many Liberals or indeed a good many
Tories.
The question is what the democratic socialists would actually do about
these aims and values if they came to power. The scales have fallen from
their eyes, and they understand there is no way back to the ideals of
1918, ideals that have anyway proved themselves thoroughly deceptive.
They expect us to praise them, indeed trust them to govern us -- for
arriving at the point that others have long reached. But it may be that,
if a Conservative reaction to modernity is now necessary, real
Conservatives remain the best people to provide it.

STRICT height and speed limits are to be imposed on Nato jets taking
part in one of two major, annual air-defence exercises over southern
Scotland and northern England next week.
The RAF said yesterday that every effort would be made to minimise
disturbance caused by the noise of low-flying during the four-day
Brilliant Invader '95, a test of ground-attack and defensive techniques
involving aircraft from six countries.
RAF and Royal Navy jets will not be allowed to exceed 517mph, or to
fly lower than 250ft except in uninhabited target areas. Pilots from the
United States, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark will
operate under more stringent restrictions.
An RAF spokesman said: ''The exercise, one of the two biggest staged
each year in this country, will involve larger formations of aircraft
than usual, but flying will take place only between the hours of 8am and
5.30pm.
''Every effort will be taken to avoid inconvenience or annoyance to
the public. The limits imposed on aircrew represent a compromise between
the training requirement and the need to avoid excessive noise on the
ground.
''In a real conflict, aircraft would need to fly lower and faster.''
Designated target areas for the six-nation exercise, which begins next
Monday, include West Freugh and Charter Hall airfields, Luce Bay
anchorage, the warship HMS Cardiff, the Otterburn range south of the
border and the electronic warfare range at Spadeadam, in Cumbria.
Fifteen aircraft types, ranging from the Nato E-3A ''spy-in-the-sky''
Awacs, to Royal Navy Sea Harriers and German Tornados, will sally out
against airfield and simulated missile sites, armoured vehicles and
naval targets.
The RAF hoped to reduce low-flying over the UK by 30% after the end of
the Cold War. But German restrictions and the expense of conducting
sorties in uninhabited areas of Newfoundland have allowed only a 4%
reduction in the last four years.

STUDENT Allan Reid tried to rob a post office at gunpoint after
Strathclyde Regional Council stopped his grant for non-payment of his
poll tax.
The 21-year-old former bank employee bought an air pistol with his
remaining cash but the raid ended in farce.
The High Court in Glasgow heard yesterday that the postmistress, Mrs
Deirdre Gilmour, fled into the back shop and hammered on the wall of the
shop next door.
Reid fled but was recognised by hairdressing staff rushing to help and
he was later pointed out to police.
Solicitor-advocate Daniel Scullion, defending, said: ''He found
himself penniless after Strathclyde Regional Council cut off his student
grant of #170 a month.''
Mr Scullion said Reid was studying maths, biology and chemistry at a
further education college and had been provisionally accepted for
university.
''Now his ill-conceived attempt at robbery has jeopardised what was a
bright future and his family are devastated,'' he added.
Mr Scullion told the court that Reid had not paid around #600
community tax through ''laziness'' and was shocked when he went to his
bank and found there were no funds.
Reid admitted attempting to rob Mrs Gilmour at gunpoint at the post
office in Cumbernauld Road, Stepps, on March 18 last year.
Lord Murray, who was told that Reid, of Netherwood Way, Westfield,
Cumbernauld, was a first offender, deferred sentence for further reports
and continued bail. He warned Reid that he could still face a custodial
sentence.
Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, said Reid had entered the post office
wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses and pointed an air pistol at the
40-year-old postmistress.
''She fled terrified to the back shop after pressing the automatic
alarm and locked herself in,'' he added.
Reid told police: ''I needed the money. They stopped my bursary
because of poll tax arrears.I never meant to hurt anyone.''
Mr Scullion said reports indicated Reid had acted out of character and
was unlikely to offend again.

VILLAGERS in Freuchie, Fife, were yesterday given the all-clear to
drink tap water again after contamination made hundreds of them ill.
Fife Regional Council said the public water supply had been
contaminated by process water from a vegetable processing company near
Freuchie.
Councillor John MacDougall, leader of the administration, said the
facts would now be carefully examined to see if a prosecution should
take place.
He said: ''The whole purpose of having a detailed examination is to
satisfy ourselves why this happened and that this type of thing should
never happen again.
''If we can establish there has been some wrongful procedure used
here, clearly the whole question of prosecution should be taken into
consideration.''
The company in queston was not named by the council but was known to
be Kettle Produce, based at Balmalcolm Farm, Cupar. A statement by Mr
Clouston McIntyre, chairman and managing director, said: ''We are
currently collating all of the relevant information and when this is
complete, a fuller statement may be available if requested.''
The statement said the company, at its Orkie Farm, specialised in
growing and washing root vegetables through a large number of local
farms. It employed 400 people, most of whom lived locally.
Councillor MacDougall said the council had acted to bring the outbreak
under control as quickly as possible. Householders were alerted last
Friday night. A leaflet issued yesterday to all householders said it was
no longer necessary to boil drinking water.
Dr Ian Jones, consultant in public health medicine, said ''several
hundreds'' of people had been affected by the outbreak, which caused
diarrhoea and sickness. A questionnaire would be issued to households to
establish the exact number affected.
The council said the source had been traced to the company's bore hole
for flushing water from the processing plant into the Freuchie burn. At
the end of last week, the discharge had inadvertently entered the public
water supply.

There is one Republican politician who could make even an odious
presidential candidate a palatable choice if she joined the ticket, as
Patrick Brogan reports
CHRISTIE WHITMAN, the governor of New Jersey, has an enormous
advantage over the other rising stars of the Republican Party. She is a
very likable person. The old veterans, senators Dole and Gramm, and the
new leaders of Congress, Newt Gingrich, Senator Rick Santorum, people
like that, vary in public perception from disagreeable to outright
loathsome.
They have their fanatical supporters, of course, people who love them
for what they say, but most Americans want to like their political
leaders. To take the most conspicuous example, Newt Gingrich is disliked
or detested by more than 40% of Americans in the latest poll. He is more
disliked even than President Clinton (he is also more admired).
The Republicans are in desperate need of some amiable conservative,
like Ronald Reagan, and there is none. They may have to settle on a
moderate.
No-one actually expects Mrs Whitman to run for the presidency next
year, but she is at the top, or near it, of every list of possible
vice-presidential candidates. She would balance the ticket nicely with
one of those old right-wing grumps, reversing the roles of
Eisenhower-Nixon in 1952 and Ford-Dole in 1976, in which the Republican
presidential candidate was the father-figure, above the fray, while the
vice-presidential candidate was down fighting dirty in the gutter.
The question is whether the radical, Christian right would tolerate a
moderate on the ticket. The Christian Coalition's public spokesman
(fronting for the Rev Pat Robertson), warned the other day that
''Christians'' would oppose any candidate who failed the test on
abortion and similar issues.
Candidates see things differently. They want to get elected.
The only major Republican candidate who might not want her as
running-mate is Pete Wilson, governor of California, who is also
inclined to moderation but suffers from colourlessness. He would never
chose a brighter partner than himself.
Mrs Whitman rocketed to fame in 1990 when she ran against Senator Bill
Bradley. He is a famous figure in the Democratic Party, a former
basket-ball star, and everyone thought he was unbeatable when he came up
for re-election. Mrs Whitman came within an ace of defeating him.
She did well in their public debates. She looks good on television,
conveying strength, sincerity and good humour. Her near-victory gave her
the right to run for governor in 1993, and she then defeated the
Democratic incumbent, Jim Florio.
She ran on a promise to cut taxes by 30%. Her victory made her the
darling of the Republican Party, or at least of its economic
conservatives, those who still believe in the Reaganite promise that
cutting taxes will increase prosperity and reduce the deficit.
There are only two problems.
The first is that the main tax burden in New Jersey is the property
tax. She has, indeed, cut income taxes but people still pay the same
proportion of their incomes, because of rising property taxes -- and the
state's deficit is rising as rapidly as the national one.
The second problem from the point of view of national politics is her
moderation. She believes in women's right to have abortions, she is
against prayer in schools, she sees nothing wrong with guaranteeing the
civil rights of homosexuals, including those in the armed forces, and
she is more than a little dubious about the new congressional majority's
attack on welfare.
She was given the prime platform of replying, on television, to the
President's state of the union address in January. She was the first
governor given the chance, and the first woman. She did brilliantly --
and conspicuously never mentioned all those issues dear to conservative
hearts, or even Newt Gingrich's ''Contract with America''. She is not
his kind of Republican. She is the noblesse oblige sort, a Rockefeller
Republican, believing in the duty of the rich to look after the poor.
Her success (and that of Governor William Weld of Massachusetts) showed
that the Grand Old Party has not fallen permanently into the hands of
the radical right.
On the contrary, there are still plenty of moderates. This makes all
the more ironic Mrs Whitman's professed admiration for Margaret
Thatcher.
She is going to London next month, ostensibly to further the cause of
New Jersey exports and business generally, and will meet Lady Thatcher
on April 18. They appear to have a lot in common. They are both
successful female conservative politicians, but in fact Mrs Whitman
represents the sort of Tory leader that the ex-leaderene firmly
hand-bagged out of the way in the 1980s.
She comes from a very rich family, and her father was prominent in the
party in the Eisenhower and Nixon days. Her social ideas are moderate to
liberal but she is a fiscal conservative. She believes in charity and
kindliness, virtues conspicuously lacking in the new Republicans -- and
in Lady Thatcher.
She has British connections, too. Her father and one of her brothers
attended British universities (Oxbridge, of course) and she spent a
couple of years in London in the late 1970s when her husband, a banker,
worked there.
Her eldest child was born in London, and part of her time there next
month will be spent visiting old friends. Only part: the first primaries
are a year away, and anyone who wants to be considered for national
office must keep her name before the public.
The name Thatcher is still one to conjure with on this side of the
Atlantic, which may just possibly account for Mrs Whitman's enthusiasm
for the iron lady.
The main point, though, for her future and the party's, is that she is
a woman of strong opinion who can, and does, convey them clearly. There
is none of the vacillation and mushiness that George Bush radiated.
Ronald Reagan had that ability. Everyone knew where he stood, and his
conviction was probably even more important than the actual detail of
his beliefs in getting people to vote for him.
The Democrats' problem is that Bill Clinton appears to lack that
certainty. The Republicans' problem is that their most committed leaders
(Gramm et al) are also the ones most inclined to put people off. But the
GOP has a solution: Christie Whitman.

A POLICEWOMAN caught with ecstasy and speed at a rave was fined #350
yesterday.
Victoria Scott, 28, of Newton Mearns, Glasgow, was caught with a
tablet of the class A drug ecstasy and a tablet of the class B drug
amphetamine sulphate, better known as speed, at a rave at the Royal
Highland Showground, Ingliston, on July 30, 1994.
She denied possessing the drugs but was convicted by Sheriff John
Horsburgh, QC.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday, when she appeared for sentence,
Sheriff Horsburgh said it was only with some hesitation that he had
decided not to jail her.
''I regard the possession of a class A drug in any quantity as a
serious matter,'' he said. ''Possession at a rave at Ingliston is a
matter of particular concern to this court where offences of this type
are being seen more and more often.''
Sheriff Horsburgh said Scott's age and the fact she had never been in
trouble before meant that community service would probably be a waste of
time.
Her solicitor, Mr Len Murray, said a social inquiry report stated
there was a possibility that Scott would lose her job.
''There is not really any possibility that her employment will not be
terminated having regard to the nature of the convictions,'' he said.
She will now face disciplinary action by Strathclyde Police.
Mr Murray said what had happened was very much a one-off incident, for
which WPC Scott would pay dearly.
''This young woman will pay a penalty which is quite disproportionate
to the offences because these offences will have brought her career to
an end,'' he said.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said: ''The matter is the subject of a
disciplinary investigation and the officer is suspended from duty. It
would therefore be inappropriate to comment further.''

Brussels,
EUROPEAN Union ambassadors adopted a notably softer tone yesterday in

in the North Atlantic halibut war.
Although they rejected peace talks until the Canadians backed down,
they relaxed their original threat of punitive trade sanctions while
Canada continues to detain the Spanish fishing boat Estai.
A Canadian gunboat fired over the Estai's bows last week in
international waters and took it prisoner, seizing its skipper, crew,
and cargo. The Estai was taken to Newfoundland where her captain was
charged with overfishing.
When the ship was moored in Newfoundland it was met by crowds cheering
the Canadian Government's stand on preserving fish stocks. EU
ambassadors were pelted with eggs and vegetables.
The Spanish ambassador in Brussels, Mr Javier Elorza, said after the
diplomatic crisis meeting: ''They have to liberate the boat
unconditionally.''
However he conceded that ambassadors had not discussed trade sanctions
as a way of punishing Canada.
The EU continued to insist that the boat had done nothing illegal and
a European Commission official said there was no evidence that the
Spanish vessel had exceeded its permitted catch.
Diplomats from the 15 EU states held their third emergency session
since the seizure of the Estai as commission bureaucrats drew up a list
of possible trade sanctions against Canada.
Spain has dispatched two gunboats to the area known as the Grand Banks
where the Estai was captured in an act denounced by the EU as piracy.
The boat was part of a Spanish and Portuguese fleet hunting Greenland
halibut, also known as turbot, 28 miles outside Canada's 200-mile limit.
Canada says it is trying to conserve the fish by limiting catches in the
region and recently passed its own law -- not recognised elsewhere --
allowing it to move against boats it deemed to be endangering fish
stocks beyond the limit in international waters.
EU officials had been reticent about the type of goods to be affected
by a trans-Atlantic trade war, preferring to see the Estai released
before taking further measures. ''There's no question of negotiations on
this affair if the captain and the ship are not first freed,'' said a
commission spokesman.
A Canadian court will decide tomorrow in St John's, Newfoundland,
whether the Estai's owners can post a bond against one count of illegal
fishing. The ship's captain, Enrique Davila Gonzales, was released on
Sunday on bail after being charged with four counts under Canadian law,
including one count of illegal fishing. Canadian fisheries officials
said the Estai's 24 crew members were free to return to Spain.
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said in Copenhagen yesterday:
''This is in fact a trade dispute, which like all trade disputes has to
be treated seriously but which cannot be solved by violating
international law.''
EU-Canadian trade is worth an estimated #13bn annually, including
#706m in Canadian fish and farm exports.
The angry Spanish Government yesterday banned all official visits
between the two countries and demanded that Canada be brought to the
World Court and punished with trade sanctions.
In Madrid, Foreign Minister Javier Solana summoned the Canadian
ambassador to make a strong protest against the seizure of the Estai.
A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain was urging talks between the
parties to resolve the dispute.
Meanwhile, Canadian officials in London said they were overwhelmed by
some 200 letters and calls of support from Britons backing Canada's
stance in the halibut war.
British fishermen are said to be behind Canada -- and would like the
Government to offer Ottawa support.

THE pay dispute at the Clydesdale Bank which led to a one-day strike
is over. Members of the Banking, Insurance, and Finance Union have voted
85% in favour of accepting a revised pay deal.
It gives a majority of staff a minimum rise of 3.5%, with more than
60% receiving a rise above 4.5%.
Mr Keith Brookes, Bifu assistant secretary, said: ''We made
significant improvements on Clydesdale's original offer, which left well
over 10% of staff with no pay rise at all and tied staff to 'flexible'
working.
''We applaud staff who came out on strike in support of our claim.
There is no doubt in my mind this was the only way to force an improved
offer and get staff the rise they deserved.''
The one-day strike last month closed more than 50 branches.
Clydesdale's original offer was worth only 2.5% with 10% of staff
facing no pay rise at all. The offer was linked to the introduction of a
new flexible working pattern.
A spokesman for the Clydesdale Bank said the bank's reaction was ''one
of great pleasure at the outcome''.
He added: ''No-one was the victor or loser in this. It was an unhappy
situation, but obviously we are very pleased that the matter appears to
be resolved now and we can get on with our business of looking after
customers.''

Los Angeles, Monday
TOP lawyer F Lee Bailey said the defence team would prove that a
police detective in the O J Simpson murder case framed the former
American football star for the murders of his ex-wife and her friend.
Bailey told Judge Lance Ito that the defence could show by
circumstantial evidence that Detective Mark Fuhrman planted the
bloodstained glove he reported finding at Simpson's estate the day after
the June 12 killings.
Simpson, who went on to become a film actor and TV personality, has
denied the murders.
Detective Fuhrman testified that he found a blood-stained glove lying
on leaves and twigs behind Simpson's mansion the morning after Simpson's
ex-wife and her friend were murdered.
The glove, which the prosecution says matches one found at the crime
scene outside Nicole Brown Simpson's home, is considered a key piece of
evidence.
Bailey cross-examined Fuhrman relentlessly on his alleged meeting with
a woman who claims he made racial remarks to her, saying he would like
to see all ''niggers'' killed.
Fuhrman denied ever meeting Kathleen Bell, who claims he told her in
1985 that he hated blacks and in particular, black men who associated
with white women. Simpson's ex-wife was white.
Earlier, Bailey said Simpson's lawyers had far more evidence against
Fuhrman to prove the detective's guilt in framing Simpson than the
prosecution had to prove Simpson's guilt in the murders of his ex-wife
and her friend.
He argued that Fuhrman ''carried that glove from Bundy, where he found
it, to Rockingham, where he deposited it, and that's what we intend to
show by circumstantial evidence far stronger than the people will ever
offer against O J Simpson on the murders''.
Simpson, 47, denies murder and faces life imprisonment if
convicted.--Reuter/AP.

<HEADLINE>Two doctors lose claims on overtime pay. Tribunal rejects demands for #4000-plus settlements against Inverness hospital</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979402977</RECORDNO>

TWO doctors have lost their claims that they were paid the wrong rate
of overtime for their posts with Raigmore Hospital NHS Trust in
Inverness.
An industrial tribunal at Inverness has dismissed the complaints under
the Wages Act by the two career registrars in the specialty of
obstetrics and gynaecology that they were paid half pay instead of 70%
of their hourly rate for being on call.
A third doctor, who has returned to Malaysia, withdrew his complaint.
Dr Christine Conner, of Rosslyn Terrace, Dowanhill, Glasgow, had
claimed she was entitled to an additional #4434, and Dr Neil Maclean, of
Garden Court, Denmore Park, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen, an extra #4269 for
the time they worked at Raigmore.
The tribunal heard that the dispute about overtime pay arose around
the time of the introduction of the ''new deal'' to reduce junior
doctors' long hours.
The deal meant doctors on call would be paid 50% of their hourly rate,
those working partial shifts 70%, and those on full shifts 100% of the
standard hourly rate.
The two doctors said they were getting an average of three to four
hours' rest each night they were on call and found the workload even
more onerous than they had expected.
They had to deal with calls from GPs who wanted to admit patients,
from junior colleagues and from the labour ward, and were left with
little time for study or social life.
They approached the consultant staff about the amount of out-of-hours
work and were told moves were afoot to get new staff grades in post to
relieve the workload. But nothing happened, and eventually they decided
to keep a diary to show they were working more than their on-call rota
justified.
Dr Maclean told the tribunal he had been known to start at 9am on a
Saturday and remain on duty until 5pm on the Monday, a total of 56
hours.
He and Dr Conner, whose overtime rates were half pay, wrote to
management, claiming that it should have been 70% as their specialty was
one of the recognised ''hard-pressed'' posts.
They moved on to other posts before any action was taken.
In its written decision, the tribunal said it had considerable
sympathy with Drs Conner and Maclean, who clearly did not enjoy the full
benefit of the new deal during their time at Raigmore Hospital.
The tribunal noted that the hospital's medical director, Dr John
Machin, was also generally sympathetic to their predicament and was
prepared to acknowledge they might have acted more positively and
quickly to address it.
The tribunal said that, having regard to the complexity of the new
deal, it was not surprising if there had been a number of teething
difficulties in its implementation.
Their successors appeared to have been contracted to work partial
shifts instead of being on call and been paid the higher rate, with the
eventual recruitment of two staff-grade personnel.
But the tribunal said it seemed the claims of Drs Conner and Maclean
were based on a fundamental misunderstanding. Their argument was that,
under the new deal, the working arrangement of junior hospital doctors
should be determined by the pattern of work and the intensity of the
workload.
In fact, the tribunal said, what the new deal provides is that those
factors should determine the working arrangement which a junior hospital
doctor will be contracted to work.
The contract dictates the basis of payment until the contract is
varied, even if the pattern and intensity of the workload is more
consistent with a different working arrangement, the tribunal concluded,
and dismissed the complaints.

Frankfurt, Monday
NICK LEESON, the trader blamed for the Barings Bank collapse, formally
refused to be extradited to Singapore and his lawyer said he believed he
would eventually be returned to Britain.
Mr Leeson told a judge of his decision during a 20-minute meeting in a
holding cell at a Frankfurt courthouse. German authorities had expected
it, said prosecutor Hans-Hermann Eckert.
Mr Leeson did not comment on the Singaporean charges against him,
other than to tell the judge that he wanted to assert his defence later,
Mr Eckert told a news conference.
''He told the judge he wants to be extradited to England and does not
want to be returned to Singapore,'' he added.
Mr Leeson's refusal to agree to voluntary extradition was the first
chance the 28-year-old Briton has had to fight the bid by Singapore to
have him returned.
Eberhard Kempf, his German lawyer, told reporters that he believed Mr
Leeson would eventually be returned to Britain.
He said that British officials investigating the collapse of the bank
were likely to issue an extradition request.
They have yet to say whether they will seek to have Mr Leeson handed
over, but have noted that to do so they must find evidence that Mr
Leeson broke British law.
Mr Leeson is blamed for running up losses reportedly as high as #916m
on Japanese stock futures that allegedly led to the bank's collapse.
Mr Leeson was taken in a prison van to the courthouse today from the
prison in suburban Hoechst, where he has been detained since arriving in
Germany on March 2 on a flight from the Far East with his wife, who has
since returned to Britain.
Mr Leeson intends to learn German in jail and to participate in work
programmes. However he will have no access to a telephone and can only
be visited by his wife and family twice each month.--Reuter.

Valenciennes, Monday,
THE former right-hand man of maverick football boss turned politician
Bernard Tapie testified today that the former Marseille chairman ordered
him to bribe opponents to lose a key match in 1993.
Jean-Pierre Bernes, general secretary of the club at the time, told a
court in this northern mining town that Tapie, a former Cabinet
Minister, personally initiated the match-rigging attempt six days before
Marseille won the European Cup.
''It is time to tell the truth,'' Bernes told a hushed court. ''There
was an attempt at bribery on my part, on Bernard Tapie's orders, with
(former Marseille midfielder) Jean-Jacques Eydelie as the
intermediary.''
Tapie, Bernes, Eydelie, two Valenciennes players who admitted
receiving money -- Jorge Burruchaga and Christophe Robert -- and
Robert's wife all face up to three years in jail if convicted of their
roles in the scandal.
Presiding judge Bernard Langlade asked Bernes, who had not previously
fingered the French and European MP in nearly two years of
investigation, if he realised the seriousness of the accusation.
''Yes, but I have had enough of hearing other people tell lies,'' the
co-defendant replied.
He said the whole Marseille team and then-trainer Raymond Goethals had
known about the match-rigging, which had been decided aboard Tapie's
yacht, the Phocea, the previous weekend.
Marseille beat lowly Valenciennes 1-0 to secure a fifth league title
in six seasons.
Tapie, 52, who denies any involvement, earlier clashed with the judge,
who threatened to expel him from court after he interrupted the reading
of the charge sheet, insulted the public prosecutor, and disrupted
testimony.
Football authorities stripped Marseille of the French and European
titles and relegated it to the second division. Tapie was banned from
holding any further position at the club.
The rags-to-riches businessman, who is also fighting a separate court
ruling declaring him bankrupt and ineligible to hold public office for
five years, began the day in a typically combative mood.
''The search for truth demands that you should not just say any old
thing,'' he exploded after fidgeting impatiently through the reading of
the indictment.
Casting doubt on the judiciary's independence from the centre-right
government, he accused investigating magistrate Bernard Beffy of having
''obeyed his boss's orders'' by charging him with active corruption.
''I am warning you, Mr Tapie. I will not allow myself to be abused by
anyone,'' the presiding judge said.
''Nor will I,'' Tapie shot back, drawing another caution.
When the first of the accused, former Valenciennes defender Christophe
Robert, told the court how he was offered cash by Eydelie, Tapie again
stood up to interrupt the proceedings.
''Even since you entered this courtroom, you have tried to sow
disruption,'' the judge told him. ''If that is your method of defence, I
will not accept it.'' Tapie subsided when the judge added: ''I envisage
expelling you.''
One of several corruption scandals to come to court in the midst of a
presidential election campaign, the trial, expected to last 10 days has
aroused almost as much interest in France as the O J Simpson murder case
in the United States.
The case hinges on whether the prosecution can prove that Bernes acted
on Tapie's orders in bribing the Valenciennes players.--Reuter.

Rome, Monday,
ITALY, a paradise for post-menopausal women who want to become
''granny mums'', may soon regulate artificial insemination and put an
end to what the country's Health Minister calls self-service
gynaecology.
Elio Guzzanti proposed legislation after the birth of twins to a
58-year-old in southern Italy prompted the parliamentary Speaker to
complain of a ''Wild West'' atmosphere to artificial insemination in
Roman Catholic Italy.
''Today, every (fertility) centre applies techniques and experiments
of every kind that are more or less safe,'' said Guzzanti, a qualified
doctor.
''Everyone does whatever they wish and this means there are no
guarantees for anyone.''
Guzzanti said he would propose legislation to oblige fertility centres
to adhere to certain technical and scientific norms as a first step to
wider legislation.
''We have reached the point of self-service gynaecology. We have
reached the point of tourism for procreation,'' he said.
''German women come to Italy for a nice holiday, go to a fertility
centre, and go home happy and pregnant.''
Guzzanti suggested preliminary lesiglation on medical standards should
precede other laws to deal with the ethical questions, such as setting a
maximum age for women who can have artificially assisted pregnancies.
Last week in the southern city of Salerno a 58-year-old woman who had
been artificially inseminated gave birth to twins.
At the weekend, Irene Pivetti, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and
a devout Catholic, called for Parliament to pass a law to end what she
called a ''Wild West'' and ''no-man's land'' atmosphere in the world of
artificial pregnancies.
Last year, Rosanna Della Corte, 62, became the world's oldest mother
when she gave birth to a boy. A donor's eggs, fertilised with her
husband's sperm, were implanted in her uterus.
The case raised a furore in Italy which has no relevant legislation.
Della Corte said recently she planned to try for another child this
year.
Italian fertility doctors have also come under fire from some
quarters, particularly the Roman Catholic Church, for helping a lesbian
to have a child by artificial insemination and for inseminating a woman
with the frozen sperm of her dead husband.
A government-appointed committee recommended last year that
scientifically assisted pregancies should be limited to heterosexual
couples of childbearing age. The recommendations, welcomed by the
Vatican, are non-binding.
Guzzanti decried the fact that without legislation, nothing could be
done about doctors who ''don't give a damn'' about non-binding
guidelines.--Reuter.

Dubai, Monday
FOREIGN Secretary Douglas Hurd said today that all Middle Eastern
states should sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to ensure
security in the region.
''I think it will be better if all states in the Middle East sign the
non-proliferation treaty,'' Mr Hurd told a news conference during a
brief visit to the UAE. ''I think that would underline the stability for
which we all hope. We hope that all states will feel able to sign.''
Israel, citing security concerns, does not want to sign the treaty
when it comes up for renewal next month despite a barrage of stern
criticism from Egypt and its Arab allies.
The issue has strained relations between Israel and Egypt and further
complicated the Middle East peace process.
Arab League foreign ministers will discuss a co-ordinated stand on the
treaty when they meet in Cairo on March 22.
Mr Hurd met UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan and other
officials for talks on the United Nations sanctions on Iraq, Iran, and
British business interests in the UAE. He left for Oman later.
His visit comes just before the UAE's defence exhibition which opens
on March 19. British firms are competing with other Western firms for
several defence deals with the UAE, including frigates, strike aircraft,
and naval helicopters.

<RECORDNO>979402983</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
HOMELESS people may be offered the opportunity to build a home of
their own.
Negotiations are under way to provide land for a self-build project at
Mountcastle Drive South and Bingham Road, Edinburgh.
The district council, which owns the land, aims to hand over to Castle
Rock Housing Association enough space to build 24 single occupancy
homes.
The intention is to provide bricks and mortar and invite homeless
people to do most of the building work.
Those who successfully complete the job would be rewarded by being
allowed to stay in the new homes.
Yesterday, the housing charity, Shelter, welcomed the initiative,
claiming it would help provide the homeless with job skills to take into
the employment market, as well as providing accommodation.
However, it is likely to upset the Transport and General Workers
Union, whose members are responsible for house building, and which is
likely to call for an inquiry into the scheme.
Yesterday, a council spokeswoman denied that the homeless were being
exploited.
She said: ''This way they are given a home and, by building it, gain
useful construction skills for finding jobs.
''They will be fully supervised by a proper construction team.''
The council is discussing the project with Castle Rock Housing
Association and Bingham Enterprise Ltd, an urban aid company which helps
restore run down areas.
Housing Convenor Mary Mulligan said: ''We have agreed in principle to
transfer the land to Castle Rock.
''I just hope the project can get the backing it needs.''
Yesterday Mr Michael Thane, policy officer for Shelter Scotland, said:
''Obviously we welcome any accommodation. But this plan has the added
advantage of tapping into homeless people's ability to help
themselves.''
* THE need for an independent housing law service is greater than
ever, Ms Sarah Hargreaves, depute director (housing services) of Shelter
Scotland has claimed.
She said an increase in homelessness and a decrease in funding made an
accessible housing legal service vital.
Speaking at the second conference organised by the Shelter Scottish
Housing Law Service in Edinburgh yesterday, Ms Hargreaves said while
homelessness had increased by 13%, there had been net cuts of 19% in
spending on housing over the last three years.
More than 30 housing advisers and lawyers heard how the service was
set up in 1993 to provide impartial legal advice.

A BRITON suspected of training right-wing hit squads appeared before a
South African magistrate today after the discovery of two decomposed
bodies on a farm south-east of Johannesburg.
Tyrone Chadwick, 36, was not asked to plead and was remanded in
custody until March 28.
Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Piet van Deventer said earlier
that detectives had arrested three Britons after the bodies were found
on a farm near Heidelberg, where they believed paramilitary training had
been carried out.
Two of them were released for lack of evidence.
The bodies were those of black men who died about 18 months ago, van
Deventer said, adding that detectives were investigating allegations
that other bodies were buried on the farm, where shooting ranges and an
old assault course had been found.
South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper reported that one of the three
Britons had told police the bodies were linked to hit squads allegedly
run by the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) and the Zulu-led
Inkatha Freedom Party.--Reuter.

San Francisco, Monday,
MORE than half of California was declared a disaster area after a
vicious storm clobbered the state from end to end, causing at least 12
deaths and possibly #1300m in damage in five days of flooding.
President Clinton declared 39 of the state's 59 counties disaster
areas after an appeal by Governor Pete Wilson.
''It's the most widespread geographic storm in California in this
century,'' said James Bailey of the Flood Operations Centre in
Sacramento.
The storms may also be the most expensive in a state already burdened
with January's Pacific storms, as well as a series of earthquakes,
fires, and mudslides.
The water washed out bridges, flushed sewage into homes, crumbled
hills into mudslides, and drowned fields of artichokes and strawberries.
The bodies of two newborn girls were washed up on beaches, along with
much of the debris.
Rain fell again today in waterlogged northern California, where
thousands abandoned their homes.
The Monterey Peninsula, south of San Francisco, was reopened after
being isolated by flooding yesterday. In the nearby coastal town of
Castroville, blocked-up sewage lines forced hundreds of people to
evacuate.
The heaviest 24-hour rainfall in the state was 1.45in, near the Shasta
Dam in northern California.
In central California a bridge on busy Interstate 5 was washed away
and four cars plunged into the water. Rescuers struggled over the
weekend to find victims.
Tons of mud from fire-denuded hills near Los Angeles inched inexorably
for the sea, shutting down miles of the Pacific Coast Highway and oozing
into dozens of Malibu beach homes. It took 24 hours' digging before the
highway could reopen this morning.
The National Weather Service predicted dry weather for Southern
California tomorrow, but two to 4in of rain was expected today in
central and northern California.--AP.

SIR James Scott-Hopkins, a former Tory Minister, a leading Euro-MP and
the longest-serving British politician in the European arena, has died
in London after a long illness. He was 73.
Sir James's associations with Europe dated back to 1960 on his
appointment as a member of the Council of Europe.
He served two periods at Westminster, as MP for North Cornwall from
1959 to 1966 and for West Derbyshire from 1967 until 1979.
He was one of the 15 members of the European Parliament appointed in
1973 by Edward Heath. The following year he was made deputy leader of
the Conservative group and in 1976 became a vice-president of the
Parliament.
Sir James was elected as Euro-MP to the Hereford and Worcester and
West Gloucestershire seat in 1979, and held it until retiring last year.
He was leader of the European Democratic (Conservative) Group from
1979 to 1982. Later he said he found the job of a Euro-MP frustrating
because of lack of interest in Britain about the European Parliament.
Sir James was educated at Eton and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He
joined the Army in 1939 and served in the Gurkha Rifles and then as a
regular officer with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, until
retiring as a major in 1950 to become a farmer.
He was a junior Minister at the Ministry of Agriculture from 1962 to
1964 and an Opposition spokesman on agriculture in the two subsequent
years.
He is survived by his wife and four children.

THE Princess of Wales took the fashion world by surprise yesterday
when she turned up, on the spur of the moment, to watch one of London
Fashion Week's catwalk shows.
Looking very chic in a navy, satin-trimmed Valentino suit, the
Princess had come to see the autumn/winter 1995 collection of Joe
Casely-Hayford who, after a few seasons' absence, returned to the
catwalk on Monday with a collection of chocolate leather and tweed
tailoring, lightened with floral satin prints.
London Fashion Week, which ends today, has become an important
stopover between Milan and Paris for international buyers and
journalists to witness top British designers like Helen Storey and Bella
Freud.
The Princess of Wales's support for British fashion was established
last season when she was guest of honour at a special Fashion Week
reception hosted by the Department of Trade and Industry.

GLASGOW District Council has put forward sweeping plans to regenerate
Glasgow Green with funds from the National Lottery.
The project, already submitted to the Millennium Commission but
revealed for the first time yesterday, involves creating a park with an
international indoor arena and a football centre of excellence on the
site of the so-called ''50 pitches'' at Fleshers' Haugh.
Details emerged when a series of proposed submissions were laid before
the city's parks and recreation committee. No costs are available but,
if accepted in its entirety, it could approach #60m.
The Millennium Commission is looking for 12 major projects throughout
Britain. Plans which focus on urban regeneration have far greater chance
of success than proposals for new buildings alone.
''We believe we have submitted a scheme which has an excellent chance
of success,'' said Councillor Colin McNicol. ''We regard it as a project
for Scotland as much as one for Glasgow.''
The Green, scene of the first Glasgow Fair in 1189, would be
completely regenerated on a scale unique in Europe, according to Mr Ben
Connolly, the director of parks and recreation. The development would
also include Richmond Park, just across the road from Shawfield Stadium.
The proposals provide for piazzas, fountains, riverside walkways,
meeting places, tree-planting, a sculpture trail, and a children's
adventure play village.
The proposed arena would almost certainly go out to international
competition but outline plans suggest a two-tier subterranean car park
and a stadium of variable capacity.
It was agreed yesterday to prepare submissions for a number of other
Lottery fund applications, including a gymnastics training centre in an
extension to Bellahouston Sports Centre and an all-weather track to
replace the cinders at Scotstoun Showground.

THE threat of financial ruin facing the operators of the paddle
steamer Waverley has been lifted with an announcement last night that
workmen will move in today to begin repair work on Bell's Bridge in
Glasgow.
The Herald has exclusively reported on a wrangle between the Glasgow
Development Agency and the management of the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre over repairs to the bridge and its access, which
suffered severe storm damage in December.
The world's last sea-going paddler, one of the city's best-known
leisure attractions, has been trapped upriver at her berth at Anderston
Quay while the two major bodies have been locked in talks over the
future of the swing bridge, which is jammed.
However, a joint statement by GDA and SEC Ltd said last night that
they had been working together to ensure that all the necessary
agreements are now in place to allow the repair work to go ahead.
It is estimated that the cost of the contract for repairing the bridge
will be #20,000 and that work to allow it to be opened can be completed
within a week to allow the Waverley to steam downstream to the Garvel
dry-dock at Greenock, where she is to receive the final stages of a
#350,000 refit.
The damage to the bridge, which is owned by the GDA, and to its north
retaining wall, which is the responsibility of SEC Ltd, was caused by
flooding from the River Kelvin.
Mr Martin Davidson, director of property for the GDA, said: ''We have
worked very closely with the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre
in a bid to resolve the situation to everyone's satisfaction. The damage
which has resulted in the bridge not being able to open was caused by a
unique set of circumstances which no-one could have foreseen and over
which no-one had any control.
''The aftermath has been an exceptionally complex situation involving
a number of difficult technical problems with potentially very serious
safety and financial implications. Not surprisingly, they have taken
time to resolve.''
Mr Mike Closier, chief executive of the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre, said: ''The damage to both Bell's Bridge and the
river frontage has been a matter of major concern to the SECC and our
partners in the city.
''The very nature of the damage and its potential implications has
meant that everyone involved has had to explore a variety of options.
That takes time and a great deal of careful thought. However, as a
result of the exercise, we have come up with a solution which everyone
has endorsed.''
The general manager of Waverley Excursions, Mr David Duncanson, said
last night he was delighted that matters had been expedited,
particularly as the entire future of the Waverley had looked bleak only
a few weeks ago due to the bridge problem.
The steamer now had a dry-dock slot at Greenock on or about March 25,
which would allow further work to be carried out in time for her first
scheduled ''Doon the Watter'' trip of the season on Good Friday, April
14.
However, last night's statement said little about the long-term future
of Bell's Bridge, originally erected as a temporary structure to
facilitate the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival.
It is understood that the Waverley's operators will now prefer to use
Yorkhill Quay downriver of the bridge, which in the meantime will remain
closed to pedestrians.
As The Herald has also exclusively reported, the GDA favours long-term
retention of Bell's Bridge as a permanent structre, but SEC Ltd wants
its removal, as it considers it could be an obstruction to its #30m plan
to expand the centre in time for an international Rotary conference in
1997.

BY common consent, local government finance is not a matter to set
pulses racing. The arcane intricacies of revenue support grants and
capital allocations are normally of interest only to the fiscal
cognoscenti.
But once every year, a figure emerges which actually matters. The
council tax puts a price on local democracy and the services that go
with it.
With elections to Scotland's new unitary authorities just three weeks
away, this year's tax levels take on extra significance, a fact
reflected by the number of councils which have managed to curb any rash
instincts and keep increases to a minimum, or have frozen the charge at
1994 rates.
Only 30,000 Scottish households will see their council tax bills fall.
All of these homes are in Stirling district.
This is no coincidence, since Stirling is the most closely-contested
authority in Scotland, and the ruling Tory administration is determined
to retain the power won from Labour in 1992 on the cut of a pack of
cards.
Last March, Conservative councillors slashed #50 off the average tax
level, the biggest cut in the UK, and another #3 was trimmed off last
week. In total, they claim to have lowered bills by 30% in real terms.
Ironically, they were helped by their Labour counterparts at Central
region, who froze the regional tax and cut #1 from the water charge at
their meeting on Tuesday.
Two days later, 24 hours before the official deadline, Stirling's
Tories set their rate. We will never know if a regional rise would have
prompted a bigger district cut, to ensure that council costs continued
on a downward trend.
Group leader Keith Harding denies that he had a contingency plan to
deal with this situation, but admits his financial regime has been
tailored to suit electoral ends.
''We have made political choices, quite frankly. We were elected on a
promise of lower council tax, and I would have been very disappointed if
we had not been able to cut the rate again this year.''
He insists, though, that the Conservative rule has not been solely
about reducing costs. The other elements of the group's manifesto
involved improving core services and restoring civic pride in Stirling.
The council creche and women's unit have now gone, the work of equal
opportunities staff is curtailed, and legal services have been
privatised.
Councillor Harding says with evident pride that the savings released
from these measures have helped finance better street-sweeping, a team
of village officers, and a programme of visual improvements in Stirling,
most notably floral arrangements at key points.
There have been redundancies -- including three senior members of
staff whose fate was sealed last week -- but he claims that the total
workforce is now one more than when Labour held power.
''The big difference between the two parties is that we believe we
were elected to provide services, not protect jobs. We are not dogmatic
about putting everything into the private sector, but we are more
business-like in our approach.
''The savings we have made, from a budget of about #17m, mean that
about #1,650,000 has been left in the pockets of the district's
residents which would otherwise have been collected in tax.''
Councillor Harding does not subscribe to the right-wing notion that,
ultimately, a local council should meet only once a year to hand out
contracts. ''That's quite impractical . . . there is a limit to how far
you can go.''
But if Stirling's finances offer little prospect of further pruning,
success in next month's elections would give the Tories control of such
regional services as education, social work, and the police, and their
large budgets.
The Conservative leader talks, with relish, of tackling ''fat and
bureaucracy'' and putting more resources into front-line services.
Labour, of course, argues vigorously that this opportunity will not
become available to Councillor Harding. The party held the council
administration from 1980 to 1992, and it has lined up Stirling as a key
target in next month's campaign.
Group leader Gillie Thomson accepts that the council tax reduction may
have a superficial appeal. ''It might strike a chord with some people,
but it's the only thing they can claim.
''The Tories have done absolutely nothing to take the town forward.
Everything they have done has been aimed at the elections.''
He contests the merit of last year's #50 cut, saying that a generous
settlement by central Government meant Labour would have reduced the tax
by #13.
Councillor Thomson is even more critical of last week's figure which
was achieved, he suggests, by ''selling the family silver''. Using an
accounting device, the administration transferred #800,000 from its
capital programme to its revenue budget.
This, he points out, will effectively wipe out work on capital
projects over the next 12 months, and also has the unwelcome effects of
increasing council borrowing and reducing next year's Government grant
by a substantial amount.
''And for what?'' asks Councillor Thomson. ''The gain is #3 per
household over a year, or six pence a week. I don't think that will make
a blind bit of difference to anyone.''
Next month, the electorate will decide if the familiar Tory sales
pitch of lower taxes is attractive enough for the Stirling experiment to
continue.

WORK began yesterday on a #10m development which will create up to
1000 full-time jobs in Fife by the year 2000.
The investment by British Sky Broadcasting would highlight the
benefits to other companies of moving to Scotland, said the Scottish
Office Industry Minister, Mr George Kynoch.
He was speaking as construction work started at the site of a
subscriber management centre for BSkyB on the Carnegie Campus in
Dunfermline.
Mr Kynoch said: ''BSkyB's decision to choose Dunfermline as the
location for this new centre is excellent news for Fife and Scotland.
Not only will it lead to the creation of around 1000 new jobs here in
Dunfermline, but it will also serve to highlight to other potential
investors the many advantages that Scotland offers as a location for
telephone-answering based projects.''
Mr Kynoch said other leading companies such as British Airways, Direct
Line Insurance, British Telecom, TSB, and Abbey National Direct also
recognised the advantages of Scotland as a base for their projects.
The pool of skilled labour, good quality and moderately-priced office
accommodation and competitive prices made Scotland a prime location for
such projects.
Mr Robert MacKenzie, chief executive of Fife Enterprise, said he
looked forward to working with BSkyB to recruit and train the 1000 staff
required.

FIGURES released by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities
yesterday show that council tax will cost an average of 6% more next
year, which is in line with The Herald's own calculations published last
week. The Cosla figures show that the average Band D tax in 1995-96 will
be #708.27, compared with #668.41 in the current year. It means an extra
#40-a-year more for Band D payers. Edinburgh faces the highest charges
-- #827.36 in Band D. Kincardine and Deeside will enjoy the lowest
mainland figure -- #562 in Band D.

A GP, who uses a tricycle to visit patients and do her shopping, is to
challenge the chairman of Strathclyde region's transport committee,
Councillor Charles Gordon, for election to the Knightswood Park ward in
Glasgow's new unitary authority.
Dr Eleanor Guthrie, 38, a mother of four, yesterday used her tricycle
to travel to the town clerk's office in Glasgow City Chambers where she
lodged her nomination papers for next month's election.
The tricycle is one of 14 cycles used by the Guthrie family who sold
their two Volvo cars six months ago because they considered them ''under
used'' and ''a threat to the environment''.
Dr Guthrie has been visiting patients in her Scotstoun surgery on her
tricycle for 12 months. Her doctor husband, Colin, who shares the same
surgery, has used the same mode of transport to visit patients for 10
years.
Launching her campaign as an Independent candidate yesterday, Dr
Guthrie claimed relentless road building advocated by Councillor Gordon
was damaging the city's health.
''I have chosen to stand for election in Knightswood Park rather than
my home ward of Jordanill as I believe that the relentless advocacy of
road building by the Labour candidate Charlie Gordon is damaging the
city as a whole,'' she said.
''Pollution caused by motor vehicles is a major source of ill health,
in particular childhood asthma. I see the consequences of Labour policy
in my surgery every day and have come to realise that to achieve good
health we must first create a healthy environment.''
Dr Guthrie said her campaign would focus on several key issues
including education, transport, health care, housing, the environment,
and support for social care networks.
She argued that local politics should be concerned with local issues
and be about empowering local people, pointing out that a high
percentage of the electorate in Knightswood Park were elderly and
dependent on public transport which she claimed was inadequate.
The GP dismissed a suggestion that her ideas about transport were
''eccentric'' and declared: ''You could say it is peculiar and eccentric
to drive round the block a short distance to buy the papers. In many
European cities, a high percentage of the population use bicycles to get
about, including ladies over 60.
''My challenge in Knightswood Park is a totally serious exercise. This
is not about making a point about cycling. It is to press home about the
viabilities of cities and arguments that new motorways create jobs and
economic growth are short-term and outdated.''
Councillor Gordon agreed with Dr Guthrie's perception that local
politics should be about local issues but he attacked her criticisms of
his transport role.
''It will be up to the electorate who has the most credible
policies,'' he said. ''But her representation of my views on
transportation matters is a gross caricature.
''She must have been sleeping in the past six months when I have taken
forward plans for a #150m tram project in Glasgow, a #50m cross-city
rail link project, a #78m airport rail link, and a #25m city centre
millennium plan to reduce through traffic in the city by 30%. I have
also presided over the recent #5m refurbishment of Buchanan Bus Station.
''Like Dr Guthrie, I am not a car owner and never have been. I travel
by public transport.''

THE Labour Party will take at least 25 of the 50 seats on the new City
of Aberdeen Council, predicted its campaign co-ordinator, Mr Bob
Middleton, yesterday at the launch of its manifesto.
The party is contesting all 50 seats in the new authority and Mr
Middleton said it had run the city's services almost undisturbed since
the last war and had built Aberdeen into one of the finest cities in
Europe. Taking the city into the twenty-first century was an onerous
task but one which the Labour candidates were well equipped to do.
''We are not frightened of anything that is going to happen over the
next three of four weeks,'' he said. ''We can stand unashamedly before
the other parties and say that what we have produced is best and what we
are going to produce is far better than any of them can provide.''

THE Scottish Liberal Democrats claimed yesterday it was the only party
that could offer Scots a fresh start in local government.
Mr Jim Wallace, the party's leader, said in Edinburgh that the
election on April 6 for the new unitary councils provided an opportunity
for voters to reject the Conservatives and Labour -- ''the two parties
of vested interest which have placed a dead hand on Scottish local
government for too long''.
Mr Wallace said a vote for the Liberal Democrats would be a vote for
the party that believed in open local government and a revitalised local
democracy. The Tories, he said, had shown a contempt for local democracy
during their 16 years in power.
The Local Government Act had removed 150 powers from local government
and handed them over to central government amd unaccountable quangos.
Tory-imposed spending cuts were squeezing the life blood out of local
government and stifling local initiative.
Mr Wallace said Labour was equally guilty of complacency and
''municipal quangoism''. The attitude of Labour councillors was that,
once they had passed the local selection process, the voters would
rubber-stamp the decision.
Mr Wallace again accused Labour of taking up most places in committees
in councils they controlled and appointing their own members to public
bodies, a matter he has already taken up with the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities.
Mr Wallace said, however, that Liberal Democrat councillors were free
to make what deals they thought appropriate with Labour or SNP
councillors. He estimated the Liberal Democrats could field 500
candidates and have more than 100 councillors in the new authorities.

THE Liberal Democrats are breaking with tradition in the Highlands by
fielding 13 candidates with the aim of establishing a Liberal Democrat
group on the new 72-seat Highland Council.
The party currently has six councillors on Highland Regional Council
but they have never acted as a group.
The Highland campaign was launched in Inverness yesterday by the three
party MPs whose constituencies cover the entire council area -- Mr
Charles Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye), Mr Robert Maclennan
(Caithness and Sutherland), and Sir Russell Johnston (Inverness, Nairn,
and Lochaber).
The MPs insisted the party could have had a candidate in each of the
72 council seats if there had been some arm twisting. Instead, they
preferred to field a quality slate of experienced candidates qualified
by their civic activity within their own communities.
Mr Maclennan, the party's national president, said: ''We have many
friends who will be standing as independents and we have no desire to
push for a large, dominant bloc. Our thinking is very much that the
council would be served best by decentralisation.
''So there is no question of seeking to dominate but there is a
quesion of seeking to build up friendships and common thinking across
the whole Highlands. We are not going to be entering these elections in
a spirit of deep partisanship. That is not our approach to politics.
''Although there has been an independent tradition in Highland
government, the scale of the new structure means that the rural areas in
particular must seek common bonds with representatives from elsewhere in
order to safeguard and advance their interests.''

<HEADLINE>Ex-council tenants told not to pay for factoring</HEADLINE>

THOUSANDS of ex-council tenants were told yesterday that they are
being charged money illegally by their former landlord.
Lawyers claim that Dumbarton District's Labour-controlled council is
making illegal factoring demands on homeowners.
And they have advised clients to stop paying #56,000 worth of bills
sent out by the council -- an action which could have a knock-on effect
on other local authorities including Glasgow, East Kilbride, Clydebank,
Falkirk, Hamilton, Inverclyde and Cumnock and Doon District Councils.
Helensburgh lawyer John Steele said: ''The best current advice is that
no further payments should be made by anyone receiving a factoring
charge from Dumbarton Council. Anyone who has paid should seek immediate
legal advice from their solicitor.''
In an unprecedented move, lawyers from Dumbarton, Helensburgh,
Alexandria and Clydebank have united to challenge the council on the
ruling. They are even prepared to fund a test case to contest the issue.
Mr Steele, Dean of the Faculty of Solicitors of Dunbartonshire was
today leading a deputation of lawyers to inform Michael Watters, the
council's director of Legal and Administrative Services, of their
decision.
Aware that the controversy could become a legal minefield, the lawyers
conferred with Professor Kenneth Reid, a respected authority on
conveyancing matters at Edinburgh University.
Mr Steele said: ''With the benefit of Professor Reid's opinion, we are
now completely satisfield that on any proper interpretation of the title
deeds, the council has no entitlement to act as factor of houses sold by
them.
''Even if the council could act as factor, the council has no right to
levy charges for its services.''
The council met an angry reaction soon after it introduced the levy,
of the order of #2.50 per week, last April.
In January, it was revealed that less than half the house owners had
paid up.
A Dumbarton Council spokesperson described the issue of charges as one
of ''fairness'' to tenants.
''The new owners enjoy the benefits of council management of a repair
service to common areas like lobbies, outside walls, roofs and
guttering.
''The council introduced factor charges to ensure that all residents
contribute to the management of their properties in buildings where the
council retains ownership of at least one dwelling, rather than finance
the service solely through rents.
''The possibility of factoring fees being introduced was stated as
part of the legal disposition which former tenants accepted when they
bought their homes.''
Factoring charges are imposed by many local authorities, and the row
comes embarrassingly close to the council elections on April 6.
Charges cover items ranging from lift and ventilation system
maintenance to emergency lighting, refuse chute cleaning, communal
washing equipment, television aerials and caretakers' wages.

Brussels,
BRITAIN has backed the use of cheap foreign crews on cross-Channel
ferries to the Continent -- despite objections from the French.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney, yesterday told other EU Ministers
in Brussels that while safety at sea was paramount there had to be room
for free competition.
He was talking during a debate in the Council of Ministers on maritime
safety after striking French seamen blockaded the port of Calais in
protest at the crewing of the British ferry Meridian last month by cheap
Polish labour.
The French Government, which now holds the rotating EU presidency,
wanted the issue put on the agenda for the meeting yesterday and said
the practice was worthy of review. France was supported by Denmark,
whose Minister called for an inquiry into foreign crewing.
But Mr Mawhinney said the European Commission was already looking into
the matter. ''The main thing is to see that these services are open to a
competitive market. We must not be restrictive,'' he said.
''We should avoid practices which make shipping more expensive,'' Mr
Mawhinney argued, claiming that using more expensive labour would only
encourage the use of non-EU flagged vessels.
Thousands of cross-channel travellers were stranded last month when
French seamen blocked ports in protest at the use of non-EU labour on
the Meridian which is owned in England and registered abroad.
Meridian's owners, a private company, said the use of non-EU crews
kept their competitive edge and did not affect safety at sea.
The Ministers took no final decisions and will return to the subject
later. But they did agree new international guidelines governing
shipping managements' areas of legal responsibility for safety on
roll-on/roll-off ferries. The new rules are subject to approval by the
European Parliament.

<HEADLINE>Bishop attacks gay campaign to 'out' him.  Confession of the 'grey area' of his sexuality</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979403014</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Bishop of London admitted yesterday his sexuality was a ''grey
area'' and said he had been the target of a campaign by gay activists to
''out'' him.
Dr David Hope, one of the Church of England's most senior bishops and
a leading contender to succeed the Archbishop of York, told a news
conference he had received intimidatory correspondence from the group
OutRage! urging him to admit to being a homosexual.
He later told BBC television news that people should not be
stereotyped sexually and while some may choose to describe themselves as
homosexual or heterosexual he chose not to.
''For some the area is slightly greyer. That's the sort of area I find
myself in,'' he said.
Dr Hope, who has never married, said he had chosen to live ''a single,
celibate life. This is a positive way of life for me. I am happy and
confident with and within myself''.
The bishop, 58, took the unusual step of discussing his sexuality
after a ''profoundly disturbing campaign'' which he said was ''based
almost totally on rumour, unattributable sources and of an intimidatory
nature''.
Dr Hope, who said he had been ''distressed and hurt'', added that he
had fought hard to combat sexual stereotyping.
His move came after a meeting and an exchange of letters between the
Bishop and gay rights campaigner, Mr Peter Tatchell.
Mr Tatchell said later they had met at Dr Hope's official residence in
January when they had enjoyed a ''very warm and friendly discussion
about the ethics and importance of coming out''.
He said: ''If you read the letter which I wrote to David Hope, which
he has now released, you will see there is no threat, intimidation, or
any other kind of bullying in that letter.''
Mr Tatchell added: ''I think the bishop ought to be very cautious and
careful about the words he uses. I will say no more for the moment.
''We are disturbed the bishop is putting a very different gloss on
what I thought were confidential and private discussions. He asked me to
keep the details of that meeting confidential. I have kept to that
bargain, he has not.''
Dr Hope said he had released a copy of two letters between himself and
Mr Tatchell written in recent months in order to allow a full
understanding of the issue.
Last week, the former Anglican Bishop of Glasgow and Galloway, the
Right Rev Derek Rawcliffe, admitted to being gay.
He was said to be the highest member of his church to ''come out.'' He
said he had come to terms with his sexuality while working in the
Pacific, where he spent 30 years.
His disclosure came just a day after Cardinal Basil Hume, the leader
of Britain's Roman Catholics, affirmed the dignity of homosexuals and
condemned discrimination against them.
The Bishop of Southwark, the Right Rev Roy Williamson, who has worked
in the neighbouring diocese to Dr Hope for the past 10 years, described
him as a man of integrity and honesty.
He said: ''I am very saddened indeed that such a devoted and diligent
bishop could be harangued and harassed by a group that seems more intent
on undermining the authority of the Church of England than promoting a
creative dialogue between the Church and the gay community.''
Lord Templeman, chairman of the ecclesiastical committee, said: ''I am
appalled at the accusation that the Bishop of London is gay. The
insinuation that he has ever indulged in anything that the Church would
regard as immoral is quite outrageous to anyone who knows him.''
In January, the Bishop of Portsmouth, the Right Rev Timothy Bavin, 60,
became a monk in the Order of the Good Shepherd at Alton Abbey,
Hampshire, after it was believed he had been targeted by the Outrage!
group.
Last September it was disclosed that the new Bishop of Durham, the
Right Rev Michael Turnbull, was given a conditional discharge 26 years
ago after admitting committing an act of gross indecency in a public
lavatory.
Bishop Turnbull has denied he is a homosexual and said a gay lifestyle
was ''incompatible with full-time stipendiary ministry''.
Lesbian and gay rights group Stonewall said it had ''grave concerns''
about the practice of ''outing''.
Ms Angela Mason, executive director of Stonewall, commented: ''To win
majority support for lesbian and gay equality we will have to educate
and persuade the whole population, rather than seeking to force the hand
of a very small number of closeted gay people in positions of power or
responsibility in society.''

DETECTIVES hunting the man responsible for a savage sexual assault on
a Edinburgh woman are hoping that the city's West End business community
will be able to help.
The 36-year-old victim, only 4ft 8in tall, remembered that a basement
to which she was lured was in or around the West End and that he had a
key to the premises.
They believe he could own premises there, or at least have access, and
could work in the area. Detectives also understand he is well known in
licensed premises close to the West End.
The assault happened shortly after 4am on Saturday morning after the
man befriended her in a pub in Lothian Road, talked to her for about an
hour, then walked down Lothian Road with her towards Princes Street.
A police spokesman said: ''She can recall walking down steps to a
door, which the man unlocked. Once inside, he subjected her to a vicious
sexual assault which continued for some considerable time.''
The woman, who was not raped, was eventually allowed to leave the
basement and reported the incident at Gayfield Square police station.
The culprit is described as white, stocky, beer-bellied, with
medium-length, dark, but greying hair and aged 45 to 50. He had an
Edinburgh accent and wore a dark suit and tie and a full-length,
dark-coloured coat.
Anyone with information is asked to contact the Gayfield Square
station on 0131 556 9270 or any other police station.
* A man who dragged a 16-year-old Edinburgh girl into bushes as she
walked to meet friends and indecently assaulted her was being sought by
police last night.
The incident happened at about 8.40pm on Sunday as the girl walked
along a footpath connecting Old Dalkeith Road and Nether Craigour.
The attacker was aged between 28 and 32, about 5ft 9in, and had long,
dark hair and a scar near his right eye. He was wearing a green coat.

TWO Glasgow councillors who failed to be selected by Labour for the
unitary authority elections next month are to go ahead and submit
nominations on their own behalf today in a last-attempt bid to get
''justice'' from the Labour Party.
District councillors Margaret Sinclair and Hugh Macrae have no
intention of standing against official Labour Party candidates, and will
withdraw on Thursday if their situations are not resolved.
The case of Councillor Margaret Sinclair is quite bizarre. Having lost
the Crookston nomination to regional councillor William Timoney by a cut
of cards, she was then granted a rerun selection meeting by the Scottish
Labour Party after she had questioned the eligibility of two individuals
to participate in the meeting.
Later the decision to rerun the selection meeting was questioned by
solicitors for the Pollok Constituency Labour Party, and this appeared
to cause deep disquiet at party headquarters in London.
The reply from Walworth Road said: ''The rules are sufficiently
ambiguous to suggest that a case could be brought against the decision
to rerun the selection meeting.
''In view of this, and the impending date for close of nominations, we
have requested our Scottish office to cancel the rerun of the original
selection meeting.''
A bewildered Councillor Sinclair said last night: ''All I'm seeking is
justice. I was told by letter there was to be a rerun, now the party in
London has taken that away. I echo party leader Tony Blair when he said
it was important to get justice for people within the party before we
start talking about getting justice for people outside the party.''
Councillor Macrae, who also lodged an appeal regarding eligibility
after losing the Greenfield nomination to fellow district councillor
William Butler, was last night still hoping his appeal could be heard
before Thursday's deadline for withdrawals.
He complained: ''No-one has had the courtesy to notify me or my lawyer
about what is to happen to my appeal. In these circumstances, and after
taking legal advice, I feel I should lodge my nomination papers
tomorrow.''
But Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party,
warned last night: ''I don't think any Labour Party member who has not
been selected as an official candidate should have nomination papers in
tomorrow.''
There is a feeling among some party members that even lodging papers
as an unofficial Labour candidate and withdrawing on Thursday merits
expulsion from the party.

<HEADLINE>Horse box theft 'staged' by Hatton, court told</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FORMER deputy leader of Liverpool Council, Mr Derek Hatton, staged the
''sham theft'' of a horse box and followed it up with a dishonest
#45,000 insurance claim, a court was told yesterday.
The former Labour councillor pretended the horse box had been stolen
after failing to keep up substantial repayments to a finance company, Mr
Peter Openshaw, prosecuting, told Manchester Crown Court.
After reporting it stolen, Mr Hatton, 47, and co-accused Mr David
Godsell, 35, secretly moved the hopelessly broken-down vehicle to a
yard, where they concealed it from police, finance company agents and an
insurance company, Mr Openshaw said.
Mr Hatton, of Thingwall Road, Wavertree, Liverpool, and Mr Godsell of
Herristone Road, Crumpsall, Manchester, have both pleaded not guilty to
theft and deception.
They are both accused of stealing the F-registered Ford Iveco horse
box, belonging to Forward Finance Limited, between January 1 and April
11 last year.
Mr Hatton is also charged with attempting to obtain an insurance
settlement from the Norwich Union by falsely claiming the horse box was
stolen, and Mr Godsell is accused of aiding and abetting the alleged
deception.
Mr Hatton, in a grey suit, listened intently from the dock as Mr
Openshaw told the jury that in 1993, he had defaulted on a finance
company agreement to pay substantial monthly instalments on the horse
box.
In January 1994, Mr Godsell sent them a fax message saying he had
agreed to buy the oak-panelled horse box, which was equipped with room
for six horses, four berths, central heating, a freezer, showers and
television and video.
But when finance company agents called at Godsell's firm, D and G
Coachcraft, at Cranberry Lea Farm, Wigan, they had failed to identify
it.
Mr Openshaw said: ''It had hopelessly broken down, the engine had been
taken out and the gearbox was supported by a wooden beam.''
On January 27, Mr Hatton rang the finance company and said the horse
box had gone, and that he thought it had been repossessed. Mr Godsell
later rang police to report the theft.
The box was later moved to another local dealer's yard in
Newton-le-Willows, where it was concealed until discovered in April.
Mr Hatton's insurance claim to Norwich Union described the vehicle's
condition as ''excellent''. He sent a photograph, which was discovered
to be of another horse box.
The box was registered as being owned by Derek Hatton Promotions and
he told the insurance company it was used to carry two or more ponies
for show-jumping by his family and for promotion work.
He said he paid #31,000 for it in 1991 and estimated its value when it
was stolen as #45,000.
The trial continues today.

SCOTTISH Conservatives campaigning for the local elections in April
will try to convince voters that their party can deliver both lower
council taxes and better services.
Senior Tories at a press conference in Edinburgh yesterday insisted
that not only had they got off their knees as the Prime Minister had
urged recently but they were on their toes and raring to go.
With Government support standing at only around 11% in the Scottish
polls, however, there were no grand claims of big Tory successes on
April 6.
Party leaders still hope to hang on to areas in which the
Conservatives now hold sway at district level such as Stirling, Perth
and Kinross, Eastwood -- now to become a part of East Renfrewshire --
and Kyle and Carrick which becomes South Ayrshire.
But even this could prove a tall order.
A recent analysis by the Local Government Chronicle concluded that the
Conservatives might find themselves in control of only East Renfrewshire
after April 6.
''It would be the ultimate irony,'' said its authors, Colin Rallings
and Michael Thrasher, ''if what many opposition politicians have called
a Government gerrymander in Scotland resulted in no Conservative
councils being elected.''
Launching the party's campaign, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said the
elections marked the start of exciting new opportunities for local
government.
''Through our reforms, a system has been created that is close to the
people it serves, involving less bureaucracy but one which should
deliver better quality services at a lower cost to council tax payers.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the party in Scotland, insisted that
after April 1996 when the new councils were fully operational there
would be no hiding place for profligate council spending.
He said the Conservatives wanted to be judged on their record in
places like Stirling and Perth and Kinross where council tax levels had
been frozen or reduced and an innovative approach also had been adopted
to the provision of local services.
In their manifesto, the Tories pledge that their top priority in local
government will be to tackle waste in whatever shape or form it occurs,
to ensure that quality local services can be delivered at the least cost
to local tax payers.
On education, they want to increase devolved school management schemes
and say the wearing of school uniform plays an important part in
establishing a sense of identity while improving morale and discipline.
Councillors' numbers are set to drop from 1611 to 1161 as a result of
reorganisation and the Conservatives expect to field around 600
candidates. They currently have 205 district councillors and 31 at
regional level.

THE Labour Party in Scotland's smallest new mainland unitary authority
last night claimed the highest proportion of women candidates anywhere
in Scotland.
Activists in Clackmannan, which has a population of just under 48,000
and an area of 64 square miles, say that percentage-wise no other local
authority will be able to match their five women candidates out of 12.
Local Labour Party treasurer Jim Thomson said the figure would have
been even higher but some prospective women candidates had to withdraw
due to pressure of work.
He said the local Labour Party had made a conscious effort to
encourage women to stand but said they had not put women forward just so
they could say they had a high number of women candidates.
Mr Thomson, speaking at the launch of the party's local manifesto in
Avla, said: ''We are delighted that we have the highest percentage of
women candidates in Scotland.
''We have checked with other party groups and are confident we have
the highest proportion in the whole of the country. We thought it
important to have women candidates but made it clear we wouldn't just
nominate them for the sake of it.
''The quality of candidates is very high -- not bad for the smallest
unitary mainland authority.''
The Labour candidate for Alloa West, Ms Margaret Paterson, said: ''I
don't think there are enough women in national politics or local
government. We must encourage more women to take part.''
Clackmannan Labour MP Martin O'Neill said: ''I think it is important
that in an area such as this, where there is a significant number of
women working in industry and the texile mills, that women are
adequately represented.''
At present, Clackmannan District Council is made up of one
Conservative, three SNP, and eight Labour councillors.
The new single unitary authority, which comes into full effect in one
year, will keep district functions, such as housing, and have all the
region functions, such as education, brought into its remit.
The Shadow Trade and Industry Minister, Mr Brian Wilson, said a
Labour-controlled unitary authority could deliver the best services to
voters in the ''Wee County''.

Brussels
THE Scotch whisky industry's campaign for reform of excise duties came
a step nearer success yesterday when the European Commission indicated
it favoured a review of the present system which discriminates against
spirits.
Mr Mario Monti, the new European Commissioner for the single market,
said he supported a ''brainstorming'' session inside the commission on
the excise regime. He made this clear to a delegation from the Scotch
Whisky Association in Brussels.
Mr Tony Tucker of the SWA said later: ''It was a useful preliminary
meeting in which we established that the Commissioner has no
preconceived ideas or agenda as to how the review of minimum rates
should be completed.''
The Scotch industry has long campaigned for an end to the duty system
which, officials argue, makes whisky and other spirits uncompetitive
with wine and beer. Giving a fairer tax break to all spirits would be
hugely advantageous for Scotch which has by far the biggest share of the
EU's spirits market.
The SWA's long-term aim is to have duty on all drinks levied in strict
proportion to alcoholic content. At present the EU stipulates that wine
may carry no duty.
Mr Monti has before him a report by the Paris-based consultants,
Bossard, which for the first time in EU history accepts there can be a
case for levying duty on the basis of alcoholic content.
However, the powerful Continental wine lobby still stands in the way
of reform.
With the French holding the rotating EU presidency until July there
seems little likelihood of a breakthrough for the SWA. The French will
relinquish the presidency to the Spanish and a succession of other
wine-producing countries.
The pattern will not be broken until Ireland takes the presidency at

NINE canoeists were thrown into a stormy Loch Ness yesterday when
their craft capsized. A full-scale rescue mission was launched and a
helicopter scrambled but the group managed to swim ashore.
Two men, suffering from mild hypothermia, were taken to hospital and
released after treatment.
The eight men and one woman in the group were in the Highlands as part
of a nine-month outward bound instructors course from the
Newcastle-based Development for Adventure.
They were travelling down Loch Ness with their five two-man canoes
lashed together as a safety measure because of the stormy conditions.
They left Urquhart Castle yesterday morning having travelled from Fort
William at the weekend.
Leader Mr Peter Roberts said: ''We tied the canoes toegther to try and
provide more stability because of the conditions. We also stayed about
25 metres from the shore just in case something like this happened.
''But, by the time we were level with Abriachan, the winds had become
so strong that one of our canoes was swamped and overturned the rest,
throwing us all into the water.
''We were all wearing life-jackets and were able to swim ashore.
Fortunately, the wind was blowing us into shore but we could have been
in trouble if it was blowing in the opposite direction. However, we were
all well-equipped and at no time did I feel we were in any danger.''
''Everyone knew what to do in the event of such a circumstance.''
Mr Gordon Menzies, leader of the inshore rescue service, said: ''There
has to be some doubt about whether they should have set out on their
journey at all given the conditions. The loch was very stormy. But a
tragedy was averted because they were all equipped with life-jackets.''

<TEXT>
A MURDER accused allegedly told police that he had knelt on the ground
and begged a mystery gunman to spare his life seconds after watching his
former boss being shot in cold blood, a court was told yesterday.
Accused George Tolmie, 39, described as a prisoner at Perth, claimed
the gunman, who allegedly spoke with a ''west coast'' accent, first
gunned down Dundee publican Mr Daniel Hallett, before kicking Tolmie in
the ribs.
He said the gunman walked off into the darkness saying: ''He's your
problem now'' got into a car and drove off. He said he got the
impression there were two other men in the shadows but he did not see
them.
Tolmie said he went to look at Hallett but he was dead. He said he
then got some pallets and stones and covered the body before returning
to Dundee. Tolmie said he returned next day with a borrowed JCB digger
to Pathcondie Farm, Letham, Fife. He dug a grave, put the body in the
hole and covered it with earth.
Detective Inspector Alexander Hirst, 47, of Tayside Police made the
claims at the opening of the trial of Tolmie, who denies murdering Mr
Hallett of Findhorn Street, Dundee, by firing a loaded shotgun at him,
shooting him on the body on November 3 at Scramble Hill, Pathcondie
Farm, Letham, Fife.
The detective told the High Court in Edinburgh that at 3pm on November
8, Tolmie came to police HQ in Dundee with a lawyer who said he had come
to report a very serious matter. Mr Hirst said Tolmie appeared to be
very upset, nervous and quite agitated.
Tolmie then stated that he knew where Danny Hallett was and that he
was dead. He said Tolmie proceeded to tell him and Detective Inspector
Hamish Tait the whole story.
DI Hirst said Tolmie had stated Hallett told him that he was involved
with some men and owed them #10,000. Hallett knew Tolmie was
remortgaging his house and asked if Tolmie would stand as guarantor or
lend him #10,000 to clear the debt. Tolmie said he had agreed to do so.
Mr Hirst told Donald Findlay, QC for Tolmie, that at the time Tolmie
called at police HQ, Tayside police were dealing with a missing person
inquiry in relation to Hallett. The detective agreed that from the
outset Tolmie said he had witnessed Hallett's death but he had not shot
him. He also admitted burying the body.
The trial before Lord Kirkwood continues.

JAILED paratrooper Lee Clegg was said to be ''devastated'' yesterday
after hearing that his case will be reviewed -- but not until June.
Mr Simon McKay, the lawyer acting for the Free Clegg Committee told a
news conference after visiting him in jail: ''He is extremely
devastated, and it was a real blow to him.''
Private Clegg, 26, is serving his sentence at the top-security
Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire, after the House of Lords rejected his
appeal against conviction for the murder of 18-year-old Karen Reilly,
from Belfast, in September 1990.
The girl was a passenger in a stolen car on which soldiers opened fire
near a military checkpoint in west Belfast. The driver of the car,
Martin Peake, 17, also died in the incident.
Private Clegg was told yesterday that his case will be considered by
the Northern Ireland Life Sentence Review Board at the earliest possible
time at its meeting in June.
The Prison Service said that this followed an internal review of the
case.
A statement added: ''The norm is that cases are considered by the
board for the first time when prisoners have served 10 years in custody.
''However, there are exceptional mitigating factors in this case, such
as those referred to by the trial judge and other members of the
judiciary at the subsequent appeals, which suggest that a much earlier
first review is appropriate.''
Private Clegg has always protested his innocence, and two million
people have signed petitions in his support since the Law Lords rejected
his appeal to reduce murder to manslaughter in January of this year.
He issued a statement through Mr McKay yesterday which said: ''My term
of imprisonment has been made bearable by the huge amount of public
support I have received since my appeal was dismissed in January 1995.
''I have also had the confidence to deal with my situation, but I
believe I am innocent of any crime, despite the tragic nature of Karen
Reilly's death.
''When I received the news this morning at 10.40am while doing my
prison duties I was devastated. It seemed once again I had received a
further blow to my morale.
''I also felt for all those who have helped by signing petitions,
writing to MPs and to those who have written to me personally with their
messages of support.''
Mr McKay said that his client's demeanour in prison is ''as composed
as ever'' despite his and his family's distress.
The lawyer said he was also ''very frustrated'' by the news from the
Northern Ireland Office that they had to wait a further three months
before the case would be considered. However, he remained confident that
new evidence would result in Private Clegg's ultimate acquittal.
Mr McKay said an application had been lodged for his cleient's release
on licence which had not received a substantive response.
Deploring the decision to review the case, Karen Reilly's father, Mr
Sean Reilly, said he was shocked and stunned.
He said: ''Politics are now starting to move into this case. We feel
it is totally wrong, unfair and unjust someone can be considered for
release so soon.''
The review was welcomed by Labour's Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary,
Ms Marjorie Mowlam.
''We want to see this case treated fairly under the normal legal
procedures that apply to all cases where a sentence of life imprisonment
has been passed,'' she said.

MRS Frances Greig may have been battered by her husband, but wishing
him dead didn't make her a murderess, a court heard yesterday.
Her defence QC claimed that Mrs Greig, 43, lived a life of hell at the
hands of her husband Robert, but did nothing more than put into words
what her heart of hearts felt.
Mr Edgar Prais, QC, told the High Court in Glasgow that an alleged
plot to murder her husband was a ''load of rubbish''.
Mrs Greig, along with her daughter Laura, 20, and Mr Thomas Whiteside,
30, the fiance of another daughter, Denise, 23, have been on trial for
two weeks accused of murder.
They deny murdering Mr Greig in his home at Shortrood Road, Paisley,
on October 19 last year by strangling him and hitting him on the head
with a hammer.
Mr Whiteside has admitted that he killed Mr Greig, but claimed it was
self-defence when he was attacked by the hammer-wielding father.
During the trial, the court heard how the Greig family lived in fear
of a drunken bully who sexually abused and raped Denise when she was 19.
The jury of nine women and six men also heard evidence of an alleged
plot by the family to get rid of Mr Greig.
Mr Whiteside, it was alleged, went to Mr Greig's house to kill him
after being given the key.
Closing, Mr Prais admitted Mrs Greig had said she wished her husband
dead.
He went on: ''Are you going to convict of the most serious crime,
premeditated and planned murder, a woman who did no more than put into
words what she felt in her heart of hearts?''
''They were words used loosely which she didn't intend to carry out.''
Earlier, Mrs Valerie Stacey, prosecuting, said the key to proving the
guilt of Mrs Greig and her daughter was the key to Mr Greig's front
door.
She claimed they incited Mr Whiteside to commit the murder and he got
the key from the family.
Mrs Stacey said: ''Therefore in my submission all three are guilty of
murder.''
The trial before Lord Johnston is expected to end today.

TAPED radio messages revealing the ''chaos'' that ensued in the
minutes after the pleasure boat Marchioness sank with the loss of 51
lives were played to the new inquest on the disaster yesterday.
The inquest, expected to last a month, is the second on the sinking,
which happened after the pleasure boat collided with a Thames dredger,
the Bowbelle, during a disco birthday party trip in the early hours of
August 20, 1989.
Urgent marine radio messages showed that eight minutes after the first
garbled call for help, there was still confusion over where the disaster
had occurred on the Thames.
Before playing the tape on the first day of the inquest, the West
London coroner, Dr John Burton, told the jury of six women and four men
at Hammersmith Town Hall: ''When there is a major disaster there is
chaos.
''It's a question of how quickly it is brought under control.''
Because of a mishearing, the Port of London Authority navigation radio
(PLA), based in Woolwich, was telling vessels to go to Battersea Bridge,
west London -- as dozens of people drowned in the swirling waters around
Southwark Bridge, five miles away.
The tape played in court began with routine messages from Woolwich
radio base, warning vessels about various minor obstructions to
navigation.
Then, 11 seconds after 1.46am, an ''unknown vessel'' broke in with the
message ''Wapping Police, Wapping Police, emergency. Pleasure boat is
sunk Cannon Street Railway Bridge (near Southwark Bridge), all emergency
aid please''.
Within seconds, Metropolitan River Police HQ at Wapping was asking for
a repeat, and was told by Woolwich: ''Pleasure boat sunk at Battersea
Road Bridge. It was very muffled but that's what I got here''.
A partly unintelligible message from an unknown vessel could then be
heard calling, ''Marchioness is sunk, Bowbelle just sunk her''.
Wapping Police were soon replying: ''We will get everybody available
that we can''. Just after 1.47am another vessel, the Royal Princess,
asking if it could help was being told by Woolwich: ''We have got a
garbled message, we believe it is Battersea Bridge, can somebody
confirm?''
At 1.54am Thames Police were appealing: ''Woolwich, have we got a
definite location for this incident, we are getting confused reports.''
It was 1.56am and 10 seconds before the PLA radio put out a ''PAN''
emergency message: ''All vessels are requested to go to the vicinity of
Cannon Street and Blackfriars rail where people are in the water.''
In the intervening time the Bowbelle crew had been telling their own
story.
Their first message, at 1.48am, said: ''Cannon Street Bridge here,
we're in the centre arch of Cannon Street now, sir, and it's this
pleasure boat we didn't see, sir.''
The Woolwich radio operator replied: ''You struck the pleasure boat,
is that correct Bowbelle?''
The Bowbelle replied: ''I believe I have struck a pleasure craft, it
has sunk. I am getting clear of the bridges now, I was distracted by
flashing lights from another pleasure craft.
''My vessel was proceeding outward bound just approaching Cannon
Street Bridge and I just lost steerage and I don't know after that, I
cannot say anything else, sir.''
Earlier, the coroner told the jury of the delays in holding a full
inquest -- no public inquiry was ever held -- and said he would try to
''find out what did happen'', while respecting the rules restricting
inquests.
The first inquest was adjourned after four days when it was announced
that the skipper of the Bowbelle, would be prosecuted.
Juries in two trials failed to reach verdicts, but the then coroner
refused to reopen the inquest. After a successful legal challenge by the
families, Dr Burton agreed to hold the new inquest.
Families were concerned at the disclosure -- long after the disaster
-- that the hands of about half the dead were removed to allow
processing and fingerprinting of the decomposing flesh, to help identify
the bodies.
The Appeal Court had ruled that the treatment of bodies after death
did not form a matter for a properly conducted inquest, the coroner
said.
''But at the moment I am trying to be as cautious as I can and as
helpful as I can. I will see what I can do,'' he explained.
The inquest continues.

<RECORDNO>979403042</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FORMER RAF communications officer claimed her bosses gave her an
ultimatum when they discovered she was pregnant -- have an abortion or
leave the service.
Mrs Fiona Ramsay said she was told by a doctor to hush up her
pregnancy and to tell friends she was leaving because she had a blood
disorder.
But she claimed colleagues from an RAF station in England learned the
truth and sent a message by telex to her base at Pitreavie, Fife.
Mrs Ramsay, 34, from Dollar, Clackmannanshire, broke down as she told
an industrial tribunal how she had been treated.
She is claiming an undisclosed fee in compensation from the RAF for
unfair dismissal after refusing the abortion and leaving in 1982.
She told the tribunal in Aberdeen that she had gone to a Royal Navy
doctor for an examination, thinking she had gastric flu.
''When I was called in, I closed the door and he told me from a
standing-up position 'you realise you are pregnant, don't you?''' she
said.
''I had no idea I was pregnant. He told me he had organised an
abortion for me at an Army hospital in Edinburgh and the RAF would not
know about it.
''I was shocked and I said there and then that I was not having a
termination. He told me to go away and get some time off and think about
it.''
Mrs Ramsay said she was raised as a Roman Catholic and that the
question of abortion was never contemplated when she discussed the issue
with her parents.
Mrs Ramsay, who was a senior aircraftswoman, said she felt the father
of the child was being protected and she was being made to feel guilty.
She said she married another man in 1991 and has since had two more
children.
Mrs Ramsay, who signed up for nine years but completed only two, is
one of seven women to have their cases heard at the tribunal office in
Aberdeen this week.
Counsel for the Ministry of Defence, advocate Ian Duguid, asked Mrs
Ramsay if she realised it was a criminal offence for a doctor to arrange
an abortion in the manner she had described.
She replied: ''I realise that. I am absolutely certain of what
happened. I appreciate it is a serious allegation.''
The hearing was adjourned.to allow the MoD to investigate Mrs Ramsay's
claim.

FOR years the 10 miles of road through picturesque countryside was
closed to the public. Yesterday, however, the former Ministry of Defence
road from Garelochhead to south of Luss was formally adopted by
Strathclyde Regional Council.
Glen Fruin road was opened in 1988 for use by construction traffic
working on the Clyde submarine base at Faslane. When work was completed
it was planned to break up the road and reinstate the landscape.
This was ruled out when it discovered that the estimated cost would
have exceeded the original #5.5m it cost to build the road. Strathclyde
region decided it would serve as a by-pass for Rhu, Helensburgh, and
Cardross and the MoD agreed to foot the #2m bill to bring it up to
acceptable standards.

THE Glasgow Film Production Fund has agreed in principle to help
finance the next Ken Loach film, which is to be shot in the city and in
Nicaragua.
The fund will provide #150,000 to Loach's company, Parallax Pictures,
for Carla's Song, the story of a Scottish human rights worker who
assists in bringing a Nicaraguan woman back to Glasgow.
This is the fourth major feature film which the GFPF has helped to
finance. The first, Shallow Grave, which received #150,000, has already
achieved critical acclaim and box office success at home and abroad.
Similar sums have also been given to The Near Room, a thriller
directed by David Hayman, which is currently shooting in Glasgow, and to
Easterhouse, BBC Scotland's first feature film, which director Gillies
McKinnon will start filming within the next few weeks.
The GFPF, buoyed by the success of Shallow Grave, is clearly
continuing its policy of targetting substantial cash help for specific
films rather than to dilute its funds -- and, therefore, its
effectiveness -- across a greater number of projects which may or may
not come to fruition.
The #150,000 for Carla's Song amounts to half of the next financial
year's budget, which starts from April. The fund is now expecting to
start reaping the financial dividends of its investment in Shallow
Grave. The additional money will be ploughed back in to future projects.
Parallax Pictures is now in the process of negotiating the rest of its
production budget for Carla's Song and filming is expected to begin in
Glasgow around September. Ken Loach is one of Britain's most
distinguished independent directors, with movies like Riff Raff and
Ladybird, Ladybird to his credit.

THE Government's plans for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs yesterday met
with widespread disappointment and frustration on the Bonnie Banks.
They involve another voluntary local government committee, similar to
that already running the Loch Lomond Park Authority but with a slightly
different cast.
There was general disbelief that the three new unitary authorities who
will cover the area, the new Stirling, Dumbarton, and Argyll and Bute
district councils, could submerge their political differences to make
the 600 square miles of the new park a priority.
Dumbarton is Labour-dominated, Stirling is Tory but only just, and
Argyll and Bute is the fiefdom of old-fashioned Independents. Some
interested parties are, however, reading between the lines and believe
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given the local authorities a chance to
make the voluntary principle work backed up by a warning that he will
use legislative force if they fail.
In announcing the Government's preference in Glasgow yesterday, the
Scottish Office Environment Minister, Sir Hector Monro, said they were
keen to see the joint committee set up, although they recognised this
would not be simple against the background of local government
reorganisation.
''There are no powers available to the Secretary of State to force
local authorities together. Nor would we want to -- a shotgun marriage
is no basis for a long and amicable relationship,'' he said.
Sir Hector rejected the notion the solution should have been
Scotland's first national park with a powerful board and substantial
central funding. He had been in charge of the English national parks for
a period when he was junior Minister for rural affairs in a previous
Tory government: the practice, he said, was not quite so successful as
the theory.
What was required was a Scottish solution: Loch Lomond Park authority
would get 75% instead of 50% of its funding through Scottish Natural
Heritage, he said, including an extra #200,000 this year while the
overall area would get #2.85m over three years.
He was backed by Mr Magnus Magnusson, chairman of Scottish Natural
Heritage. ''We must make sure we arrive at the very best solution to the
very different circumstances we have in the different parts of
Scotland.''
Lady Isobel, Countess of Glasgow, who is chairman of the Scottish
Council for National Parks, said she was extremely disappointed the
Government had opted for a solution based on local authorities who
''have no great record of co-operation over Loch Lomond''.
She added: ''There were very few people who did not want a national
park.''
Mr John McFall, MP for Dumbarton, said: ''This is a kick in the teeth
for Sir Peter Hutchison and his team who compiled the report.''
''Ten years ago they had the Countryside Commission examine the
problems in the report on the Mountain Areas of Scotland. Then they
dumped it in the lap of ''Ten years ago they had the Countryside
Commission examine the problems in the report on the Mountain Areas of
Scotland. Then they dumped it in the lap of Sir Peter who recommended a
management organisation.
''Now they are reinforcing the voluntary principle which is seen to
have failed time and time again. They will have to come back in future
to compel the local authorities to work together. Loch Lomond is not an
asset of the local authorities or even the local community. It is a
national responsibility.''
The disappointment was echoed by Mr Robert Findlay, of Knockour,
Balloch -- former owner of Boturich Castle and estate overlooking the
loch -- who said: ''Those who will run Loch Lomond will be visitors
here. They are all townies with townie attitudes. They have never heard
a sea plane or a jet ski outside their door. I feel deep frustration.''
Another group who feel they have lost out is the Loch Lomond Angling
Improvement Association, whose chairman, Mr Bill Muir, said: ''We know
now the good days on Loch Lomond are gone and it will never be what it
was 20 years ago.
''We will be cautious and wait to see if what they are doing with
by-laws does anything to solve the problems of disturbance but the
feeling is there is no real sanction against the jet skiers, water
skiers and speed boaters.''
One former member of the working party, Mr Martin Mathers, of the
Worldwide Fund for Nature, struck a more optimistic note.
He said that in the response document issued by Mr Lang, it states the
legislation provides a joint board mechanism whereby he can require the
authorities to come together at some future stage should the mutual
co-operation route be seen to have failed.
Mr Mathers said: ''In other words the Secretary of State is telling
them to make it work and if you do not I will impose a joint board.''

THE chief executive of the Student Loans Company, Mr Ron Harrison, has
been dismissed after an investigation into alleged financial
irregularities, the Glasgow-based organisation announced yesterday.
Mr Harrison has been sacked for ''errors of judgment and slackness''
over personal expenses. But no evidence of corruption has been found in
the investigation carried out by accountants Coopers and Lybrands on
behalf of the Department for Education.
The inquiry was begun last year after allegations about the running of
the Government-owned company were forwarded to the DFE by the
Government's financial watchdog, the Comptroller and Auditor General Sir
John Bourn.
It took longer than expected because Mr Harrison took ill in November
and was said to be too sick to answer investigators' questions. His sick
leave began at a time when the SLC was already under attack over
administrative blunders which were causing hardship for thousands of
students.
Student organisations were complaining about a growing backlog of
applications from existing borrowers, exacerbated by the introduction of
a new scheme which had been intended to simplify matters. By Christmas,
the backlog of repeat applications had reached 35,000.
Mr Harrison's dismissal follows a disciplinary hearing by a special
committee of the SLC board which took place on March 3. Mr Harrison, who
did not attend but was represented by a solicitor, has until March 20 to
appeal. Sir Eric Ash, who took over as acting chief executive when Mr
Harrison went sick, will continue in the post until a permanent
appointment is made.
Yesterday, the company's assistant managing director, Mr Colin Ward,
explained that Mr Harrison had been dismissed for ''conduct which
brought himself and the company into disrepute''.
This conduct involved: ''errors of judgment and slackness'' relating
to his personal expenses; improper authorisation of overtime; and
misleading the board during an earlier investigation.
Although Mr Harrison has remained on sick leave since November, it is
understood that he has recently been working in his wife's bistro in
Largs.
But Mr Ward said yesterday that reports of this had nothing to do with
his dismissal. ''One can easily pour cups of coffee when one is
suffering from a stress-related illness. It is a different ball game
from running a company like this,'' he said.
Mr Harrison was at the bistro yesterday but declined to make any
comment about his dismissal.
In Glasgow, his lawyer, Mr Ian Watson of Hughes Dowdall, would say
only: ''I will be taking my client's instructions tomorrow and I will be
advising him to consider litigation by way of a writ for breach of
contract.''
Deputy Shadow Scottish Secretary John McFall last night described Mr
Harrison's sacking as ''too little, too late for many students''.
''I think the whole organisation has to be looked at from top to
bottom.''
Yesterday, Liberal Democrat MP Robert Maclennan, a member of the House
of Commons Public Accounts Committee, said there were other serious
questions still to be answered.
''It is essential that the SLC puts in place proper checks, management
controls, and proper information systems, so that students are not left
high and dry.''
Mr Douglas Trainer, president of the National Union of Students in
Scotland, said: ''The SLC has gone through a difficult period in terms
of its adminstration but things are picking up. Our relationship with
Sir Eric Ash is positive and he has taken on our concerns.''
In a letter to Labour education spokesman David Blunkett, Education
Secretary Gillian Shephard said the results of the investigation at the
SLC would be reported to the National Audit Office and the Public
Accounts Committee.

<HEADLINE>Blair reform wins backing of the many Clause 4 appears history</HEADLINE>

LABOUR'S national executive yesterday voted overwhelmingly to accept
the new version of Clause 4 proposed by Mr Tony Blair, delivering what
the Labour leader called a defining moment in the history of the party.
The executive voted by a majority of 21 to three, with five
abstentions, to abandon the party's 77-year-old commitment to widespread
nationalisation and endorse a set of aims which Mr Blair claims make the
party modern and worthy of the public's trust.
The clause's new wording, which opens by defining Labour as a
democratic socialist party, extolls the merits of common endeavour to
create a ''community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the
hands of the many not the few''.
The first paragraph's distinctly un-poetic 87 words will replace the
historic commitment to the ''common ownership of the means of
production, distribution and exchange'' on the back of party membership
cards.
Yesterday's vote all but guarantees victory for Mr Blair at next
month's special conference called to approve Labour's revised
constitution, and draws a line under a policy commitment which has
dogged the party since it was voted out of office in 1979.
Despite an attempt to block proceedings led by Bolsover MP Dennis
Skinner, the executive, made up of MPs and trade unionists, had no
difficulties overcoming opposition. Only Mr Skinner, MP Diane Abbott,
and Mr Vernon Hince of rail union RMT voted against change.
Only a handful of the unions that will control 70% of the votes at the
special conference on April 29 have taken a final view on the matter.
The four major unions whose representatives on the executive abstained
yesterday together represent 41.5% of the total conference vote.
However, last night it looked as though the General, Municipal, and
Boilermakers union, which controls 12% of the total, might be moving
towards acceptance. Representatives of the TGWU union also signalled
that their union may back Mr Blair in April.
The rest of the meeting was spent discussing the new Clause 4, which
Mr Blair drafted at the weekend with his deputy, Mr John Prescott. No
substantive changes were made.
Left wingers opposed to change criticised the absence of any mention
of full-employment, and promised to keep up their campaign to save the
old Clause 4. MP Tony Benn, the left's standard bearer, said: ''Labour's
heart is being cut out and handed to the City.''
Emerging from the meeting, Mr Skinner said: ''I think the whole thing
was a waste of time and allowed the media to concentrate on the
arguments within the Labour Party which could have been avoided.''
Trade unions had wanted a commitment to full employment, and will
press for it to be included in the next party manifesto. However, Mr
Blair has refused to make undeliverable promises.
At the heart of the new clause is a statement of market-driven
economic values. It commits the party to a dynamic economy and a
''thriving public sector'' in which public services ''essential to the
common good'' are either publically owned or accountable to the public.
The rest of the clause endorses a just society, nurturing families,
equality of opportunity, the fight against prejudice, open government, a
healthy environment, strong defence, and co-operation with unions. ''On
the basis of these principles,'' it concludes, ''Labour seeks the trust
of the people to govern.''
Mr Blair said: ''We are the people's party. We should address the
people's agenda. We should speak the people's language. Too often in the
past we have been afraid to admit change. We've told the public we have
changed, while assuring the party we have not.''
Mr Prescott conceded that he had been sceptical about the need to
change the constitution when Mr Blair first suggested it at last
October's party conference. ''But I think almost everyone would admit
that this has done us a power of good. We have had one of the biggest
political education campaigns in the history of our country,'' he said.
Mr Blair led a consultation exercise which saw him address 18,000
party members around the country. It culminated on Friday when the
Scottish Labour conference voted by more than 58% to back his
modernisation efforts.
Mr Blair said in a Channel 4 news interview: ''I am not looking for a
great symbolic victory over my own party. I am looking to give the party
back a clear ideological compass for the rest of the 1990s and the 21st
century.''
However, there are still those in his party who felt in no need of any
change of ideology. Labour Euro MP Alex Falconer, prominent in the
battle to save Clause 4, said the new words could be supported by any
free-market Liberals -- and many centre Conservatives.
''Where is the strong commitment to public ownership, any mention of
common ownership, or the other additions which we were told were
needed?'' asked Mr Falconer, Euro MP for Mid-Scotland and Fife.
A rump of furious left-wing MPs pledged to continue their fight to
defend the old Clause 4 by sending 100,000 documents attacking the new
version to party members.
Mr Benn warned: ''You cannot win by absorbing and taking over the
philosphy of your opponents. Labour's heart is being cut out and handed
to the City. This is really our promise to the City: 'Don't worry, we
will never interfere with your right to run the economy'.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson called the new clause a
''radical, inspiring but understandable statement'' which would
''delight'' the Scottish party.
''There is no doubt that the debate at the Scottish conference must
have had a defining effect on the final wording,'' he said.
For the Tories, Employment Secretary Michael Portillo said: ''Weasel
words will not disguise the clear truth. Labour's socialist instincts
remain. They want higher taxes, more spending and more Government
regulation and intervention.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said the new clause lacked only a reference to
''motherhood, apple pie and fresh air''. He said: ''Tony Blair has taken
the core of the Labour Party and turned it to mush.''

WITHIN two hours of being jailed for three months for common assault,
the disgraced England and Chelsea midfield football player, Dennis Wise,
was freed yesterday by a Crown Court judge who took just a few minutes
to allow an appeal.
On the verge of tears, the 28-year-old Chelsea captain, capped eight
times for England, had earlier heard a magistrate describe him as a
bully who deserved the same treatment as anyone else who appeared before
the courts on similar charges.
The sentence seemed to be yet another savage blow on the rapidly
disintigrating reputation of the game in England.
However, within hours, Judge John Rogers heard an application in
camera at Southwark Crown Court and ruled that the football player
should be allowed unconditional bail to allow an appeal to go ahead.
It is understood that it will be against both conviction and sentence.
The judge having given his decision, Mr Wise was freed from the cells
at the magistrates' court. Until the ruling from the higher court was
announced he was waiting transfer to Brixton prison.
He and his girlfriend, Ms Geraldine Lennon, wept, embraced, and kissed
before jumping into a taxi.
Wise had last month been found guilty of assaulting a 65-year-old taxi
driver and causing criminal damage to his vehicle. He had denied the
charges.
The sentence delivered yesterday at London's Horseferry Road
Magistrates' Court shocked the English football establishment.
''This is why we launched this appeal for bail,'' Mr Colin Hutchinson,
managing director of Chelsea, said on the player's release after the
hearing at Southwark Crown Court.
''It is now up to the judges at this higher court. We are obviously
pleased for Dennis.''
Although the player is now free to play for his club, almost certainly
he will not be taking the field for tonight's second-leg European Cup
Winners Cup game against FC Bruges.
Even before his jail sentence, the club had said that the midfield
player had been ruled out because of injury.
Earlier in the day, the footballer had slumped in his seat in the dock
of the magistrates' court after sentence had been passed. He put his
head in his hands between his knees.
Dressed in dark trousers, a tie, and waistcoat, he knotted his fingers
nervously behind his back as the magistrate told him that the offences
were so serious that only a custodial sentence could be justified.
In delivering the three-months sentence, stipendiary magistrate
Geoffrey Breen had also ordered that the player should pay #965.95 to
the taxi driver for the damage to his vehicle, #169.95 for his
spectacles, #100 towards his shock and distress, and #370 towards the
prosecution costs.
''I am aware of your considerable status as a professional footballer,
and one who has had the honour of representing his country,'' the
magistrate said, ''but that doesn't entitle you to special treatment.''
Wise, who lives in London's East Acton, was convicted last month after
an incident outside the Scribes nightclub, in Kensington, London, which
is owned by England coach Terry Venables.
The fracas began after the taxi driver refused to take the player to
his stated destination. Ms Lennon was injured during the incident.
Since his conviction, the player had received hate mail, Mr Adrian
Fulford, QC, counsel for Wise, had told the court.

THE share turmoil in the electricity sector took a fresh twist last
night. The board of Trafalgar House revealed it has written expressions
of support from holders of more than half the equity in its bid target
Northern Electric at the revised offer price of #9.50 a share.
Trafalgar is seeking permission from the City Takeover Panel to
proceed with its lower bid. It withdrew its original #11 per share offer
on Friday after the industry regulator had sent electricity shares into
free fall with the promise of tougher price controls.
However, Northern's board is refusing its consent for the lower bid
and normally, under City rules, Trafalgar would have to wait one year
before it could bid again.
But nothing is normal in this extraordinary saga and the shipping,
hotels, and engineering conglomerate's garnering of majority support
among Northern's shareholders for its new terms to be put to them is
bound to put pressure on the regional electricity company's directors
and the City authorities to let the revised offer proceed.
''I hope the expressed wishes of the majority of Northern Electric's
shareholders will now allow our revised offer to proceed,'' said
Trafalgar House chairman Mr Simon Keswick in a statement issued through
its adviser, Swiss Bank.
Earlier, Northern's share price had fallen another 70p to 738p as the
markets responded to the Northern board's rejection of the revised
terms. Other electricity shares were down just a few pence.
Trafalgar's brokers, Cazenove and UBS, have been asking Northern's
institutional shareholders to sign forms of support for the revised
terms to be allowed to proceed since late last week.
American arbitrage interests have built up an estimated 25% interest
in Northern and yesterday one of these players, Mr Guy Wyser-Pratte,
demanded in a letter from New York to Northern's chairman, Mr David
Morris, that the board recommend the renewed bid, allowing investors to
consider it.
''By preventing shareholders from making an informed choice between
competing proposals, the Northern Electric board was usurping the power
of shareholders to determine what is in their best economic interest,''
he said. They were abusing their position, he added.
Mr Wyser-Pratte's firm wants an extraordinary meeting of Northern
shareholders and is threatening to sue Northern's directors for damages.
Mr Keswick said: ''It would be incomprehensible in these
unprecendented circumstances if the Northern board imagined that
shareholders interests would be best served by blocking a Trafalgar
offer.''
The whole takeover saga, which was triggered by regulator Professor
Stephen Littlechild deciding to consider new, tougher price controls on
the regional companies eight months after he had supposedly completed a
review which was to run until the year 2000 and three days before the
original Trafalgar offer was due to close, is now threatening to further
undermine the credibility of the London market hard on the heels of the
Barings affair.

* The Prime Minister changed his plans for his departure for Jordan
today, raising prospects of a breakthrough in the Arab/Israeli peace
process. He is to return to Jerusalem to report to Premier Yitzhak Rabin
after his meeting with Mr Yasser Arafat in Gaza, a move coinciding with
the arrival of US Secretary of State Warren Christopher fresh from talks
in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. The three statesmen
could combine on a deal to restart the all-important negotiations
between Syria and Israel, which would give the Prime Minister vital
status when he goes to Washington next month.

THE Prime Minister now expects President Clinton, who is welcoming
Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams to the White House on Friday, to force
him to start delivering the IRA arsenal of weapons.
Mr Major wrote to the President last Friday to make his views clear.
In Jerusalem yesterday he was asked to reveal the contents of his
letter to the President, which followed the United States's decision to
ignore British warnings and invite Mr Adams to the White House for St
Patrick's Day celebrations and also give him permission to start
fundraising again.
Mr Major refused to do so, but, in a passionate statement at a press
conference, he revealed that President Clinton is now required to
deliver an IRA ''de-commissioning'' of their weapons.
''I think it is important to keep the peace process on track. I think
it is important that pressure is put on Sinn Fein so that they will
agree to examining the modalities of de-commissioning their weapons; and
then proceed beyond that and actually de-commission them.''
Mr Major emphasised this when questioned again about President
Clinton's decisions and their effect on UK-American relations. ''I very
much hope that Mr Adams is prepared to take that kind of step, and I
very much hope that that course is urged upon him.''
The Prime Minister, who is to visit President Clinton early next
month, is clearly concerned that Mr Adams's publicity gift from the
White House is dangerous to the six-month ceasefire in Northern Ireland
and liable to thwart the delicate balance of negotiations aimed at
bringing Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists to talks for a political
solution.
Mr Major is sensitive to criticism that he is to visit the PLO leader,
Yasser Arafat, today in Gaza when he is not yet anywhere near ready --
despite pressure from Washington -- to allow his Ministers to talk to Mr
Adams.
He said last night:: ''If Mr Adams is concerned about peace and wishes
to see it move forward, he has no need of weapons. Let us discuss not
just broad, waffly views about what we might do with them, let us
discuss practical modalities for de-commissioning weapons -- for
disposing of the arms that no peaceful body needs.
''So that, if these weapons can be taken out of service, then the
other political parties can sit down with Sinn Fein and try to put a
political solution together.''
Mr Major was twice asked if he would reveal the contents of his letter
to President Clinton last Friday, but he insisted that he would not do
so, claiming that there are certain things you do not say in public.
''I don't suppose we are always going to agree on every subject on
each and every occasion, but this isn't going to effect the degree of
mutual interest between the UK and the United States.''
Mr Major's accompanying party of 29 leading businessmen spent long
hours yesterday looking for opportunities to trade evenly with Israel
and the Arab countries. Yesterday the Prime Minister was taken to the
Golan Heights by the Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, to be shown
how close the state of Israel lives to potential disaster.
The White House yesterday brusquely dismissed British protests at the
welcome mat that is being unrolled for Mr Gerry Adams. The spokesman, Mr
Mike McCurry, said: ''We are aware of their concerns and we stated our
views and said that we hope that they understand ours.''
He suggested, politely, that it was contradictory for the British to
protest that Mr Adams should be allowed to raise money for Sinn Fein in
America, when there is no objection to his doing it in Britain.
Mr Adams was asked at a fund-raising event last night whether his
sarcastic attacks on the British Government might not harm the peace
process. He replied: ''Isn't it better to be fighting with words?'' He
also said that Mr Major should ''stop making excuses and start making
peace''.
He raised about $20,000 on Sunday at his first fund-raiser, in an
Irish club in Queens, New York. There were about 1000 people present,
and the suggested contribution was $20 each.
Meanwhile the Irish Prime Minister, Mr John Bruton, last night applied
new pressure on Sinn Fein to prompt the de-commissioning of IRA arms.
He said in Dublin ahead of his departure today for the United States
-- where he is set to meet Mr Adams at least twice this week -- that
''concrete proposals'' were needed from the party on the future of
terrorist weapons.
Mr Bruton declared: ''Sinn Fein must go beyond the mere statement of
willingness to talks about arms some time.
''There have to be concrete proposals, which can be reciprocated. We
have got to get some movement on the arms question.''
