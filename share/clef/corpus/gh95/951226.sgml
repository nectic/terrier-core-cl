<HEADLINE>Councillors settle out of court in two-year defamation action Apology resolves `drunk' dispute</HEADLINE>

TWO political opponents, who were set for courtroom action to resolve a bitter
two-year row, have settled their differences with an apology and a payment.
Councillor Peter Grant, an SNP member of Kirkcaldy District Council in Fife,
has agreed to apologise publicly to Labour Councillor David Duffy, a former
convener of the housing committee.
The Nationalist and a party colleague have also promised to pay #5000 towards
Councillor Duffy's expenses plus #50 to the MacMillan Cancer Fund, a charity
nominated by Mr Duffy.
It ends a #30,000 damages action raised by the Labour man against Councillor
Grant, of Elm Lane, Glenrothes, Mr Peter McCulloch, of Morar Street, Methil,
and Barr Printers, Glenrothes.
Mr Duffy claimed that an allegation in a Nationalist newsletter - delivered to
homes in the Leven area in November 1993 - that a councillor was ``stocious''
for the ``full three days'' of a housing conference at Aviemore was intended to
refer to him.
Although he was not named, with the paragraph referring simply to a
``Levenmouth Labour councillor'', he said he was the only Levenmouth councillor
at the event.
Mr Duffy, a 75-year-old retired public house manager from Den Walk, Buckhaven,
served writs on the two SNP men and the printers of the leaflet seeking damages
for defamation. He strongly denied any suggestion that he was drunk.
The item which offended Mr Duffy was on the front page of a publication named
SNP News Levenmouth Special, edited by Mr McCulloch and circulated in the Leven
area by Councillor Grant.
Under the heading Past Their Sell By Date, a paragraph referred to reports
about a ``Levenmouth Labour councillor who attended a housing conference in
Aviemore and was `stocious' for the full three days''.
It adds: ``He was apparently found collapsed over a computer during a
demonstration. Who do you think it was?''
Mr Duffy alleged that because of the publication and distribution of the
article, his feelings and reputation suffered. He said: ``The claim made is
totally false. I was definitely not drunk, far from it.''
He said people ``definitely made it clear they thought it was me''.
The council's ruling Labour group was also ``incensed'', and contacted lawyer
Ron McKenzie.
At the time, Mr Grant confirmed he had received the writ. ``I have spoken to my
solicitor and I intend to defend this action,'' he said.
He added that he hoped his Labour colleague ``sees sense and does not take it
through the court''.
Apart from the cash settlement, he and Mr McCulloch have agreed to publish at
their own expense, a double column advert in the Dundee Courier and East Fife
Mail.
It will state: ``Peter Grant and Peter McCulloch accept that the allegations
which were directed against Councillor David Duffy in the SNP News Levenmouth
Special which was circulated in November 1993 were mistaken and unfounded in
fact.
``They apologise to him for any upset and embarrassment which the allegations
may have caused him. To make amends they have donated a sum of money to a
charity of Councillor Duffy's choice.''
Mr Duffy said: ``I am glad they have decided to publish a retraction to clear
my name, but I am very disappointed that it took so long and they waited until
almost the last day before withdrawing.''
He said that if Councillor Grant had wished to make any allegations about his
conduct, he could have done so to the district council's general manager who
would have investigated the matter.
Councillor Grant said: ``I can certainly confirm that an agreement has been
reached but the legal advice I have is that, other than that, I shouldn't give
any more details. People can interpret it any way they want.''
A spokesman for the council's Labour group said: ``We are pleased this
despicable slur on a group member has been withdrawn at a cost to the SNP
members.''

IT was a rather sickly Alternative Christmas Message on Channel 4 from the
ageing actress turned saviour of cute furry things, Brigitte Bardot.
On the other side the Queen spoke of world peace. Bardot, balancing a pair of
spectacles on her nose, plumped for an analysis-free plea to British animal
lovers to campaign for the release of 450 dogs kept in ``horrific, secret
detention kennels'' and an end to the clubbing of baby seals.
To the tinkling sounds of The Carnival of Animals, the viewer was treated to a
brief cinematic montage of Bardot's animal rights campaign efforts. Then the
actress, clad in black, flashed a smile and announced to the nation: ``I am so
happy to speak to you.''
But joy sooned turned to sorrow as she remembered her grief for veal protester
Jill Phipps, who was killed last January.
There were grave words too about the plight of a pit bull terrier named
Dempsey. The actress described how Dempsey had avoided a death sentence under
the Dangerous Dogs Act but said we should not forget those less fortunate and
fight for a change in the law.
``My message for 1996 is for justice in this country for dogs who share our
daily life with so much love and tenderness.''
She said ``no victory is final'' as she lamented that her seal campaigning
efforts over the years had failed to prevent the culling of those cuddly,
helpless creatures in Norway and Canada.
Then there was a warning to those cruel purchasers of animal products. ``Some
women think of fur as a sign of wealth when it's a cemetery they wear on their
backs.''
In her halting English she said she loved the British people because they loved
animals and appealed for the public to boycott products such as fur, to make
others aware of the suffering of animals, and to refuse to eat food which had
involved cruelty to animals.
Before a coy kiss goodbye, Bardot added: ``I now wish you a sweet and merry
Christmas without the turkey.''

<HEADLINE>Hotel blaze Britons condemn `near disaster'</HEADLINE>

BRITISH tourists today angrily attacked the emergency services after fire raged
through the ground floor of their luxury hotel in Marbella, on Spain's Costa
del Sol, in the early hours of Christmas morning.
Most of the 200 guests at the eight-storey Hotel Don Pepe groped their way to
safety along smoke-filled corridors to a single fire escape, while others stood
on the balconies of their rooms shouting for help.
The blaze broke out around 2am in the kitchen area and spread to the restaurant
and reception hall. Dense smoke billowed up to the other floors.
Many of the guests said fire alarms were not working, there were no warnings of
the blaze from hotel staff, and the first fire appliance took nearly an hour to
arrive.
Mr Brian Brown, 52, from Catford, London, on holiday with his wife Linda, said:
``There could have been a major disaster. It was sheer toytown. Those in charge
of security had no idea.
``The firemen were unbelievably inept, like amateurs. They had no breathing
apparatus. When the first appliance arrived after about an hour, it was so old
that I haven't seen its like in London for 30 years.
``I had a nightcap at about 1.15am and then went to bed. About an hour later, I
woke up and could smell the smoke. I went to the window and saw the flames. I
woke Linda and said: `Wack this on!' passing her a tracksuit.
``When we opened the door to the corridor, it was full of black, oily smoke.
Holding my wife's hand, we edged along the wall and made it to the fire
escape.''
Mr Brown and his wife, who is managing director of a catering company, paid
#2000 for a 10-day holiday. He added: ``I know that eight fire alarms were
smashed but none worked. I have spoken to other Britons and we are planning to
sue for criminal irresponsibility.''
Mrs Jackie Scott, a medical secretary from Earls Court, London, was wakened by
her brother, Mr Julien Priestley, who had taken her and their mother for a
Christmas break.
Mrs Scott said that Mr Priestley, who works for the European Parliament, called
her from his seventh-floor room and said: ``Don't panic, but there's a fire.
Get yourself and mother out.''
In their nightclothes they made it to safety down the fire escape. The main
entrance was blocked by flames and smoke.
Mrs Scott added: ``I first heard breaking glass, then lots of people shouting.
But there was no real panic. Many people were standing around for a long time
in their nightclothes.
``The first fire appliance drove up but it did not produce water. Then some
wonderful people from a nearby cafe let us in and gave us coffee and as many
clothes as they could find. Then we were taken to a sort of municipal hall
where we just sat around until 7am.''
``I think every fireman in Marbella was asleep,'' said Wolfgang Trevisany, a
48-year-old Berlin businessman on holiday with his wife and two children.
He said: ``It's only sheer luck that dozens of people were not killed. No fire
alarm sounded. Flames and smoke were going up through the building. People were
rushing around shouting `fire', trying to wake up the guests.
``The flames and smoke stopped us getting out of the main entrance and the
hotel only had one, narrow fire escape. It took an hour for the first fire
appliance to arrive. And then the firemen were not equipped with breathing
apparatus.''

Delhi, Monday
ANGUISHED parents searched through rows of charred bodies for their children
today after a flash fire tore through a school prize-giving in a small north
Indian town, killing at least 400 people.
``The number of deaths is definitely going to go up. We are receiving news of
only deaths,'' senior district official Y C Bhardwaj said from the packed
Dabwali hospital in Haryana state about 160 miles northwest of Delhi.
He said at least 400 bodies had been recovered from the scene of Saturday's
fire at the Rajiv Marriage Palace, a brick-walled and tent-topped structure
used to hold wedding ceremonies and other functions.
At least 120 people were being treated at the hospital in Dabwali and other
medical centres nearby for burns.
Tractors from local farms were used to transport bodies to the crematorium. A
large farm near the crematorium was converted into a makeshift cremation site.
Bangwarilal Angi, a senior official at the crematorium, said more than 400
bodies had been cremated already.
Rows of charred corpses, many little more than skeletons, lay on the grass
outside the Dabwali hospital today.-Reuter.

EXCLUSIVE
A FATHER'S complaint that social workers failed to monitor the circumstances of
a child who was horribly burned in a fire while in the care of her drug-using
mother has been upheld by a council complaints committee.
The child, Lisa, now five, was severely burned about the face and neck, lost
her right hand, the fingers of her left hand, and now faces 20 years of plastic
surgery.
However, the father failed to convince the complaints committee that
Strathclyde Social Work Department had not adequately supported his subsequent
efforts to establish a home for his four children.
For James Morrison, 37, an asbestos dismantler, the decision by the social work
complaints review sub-committee represents the end of a four-year nightmare
during which he struggled to reclaim his four children from care and also
gained an Ombudsman's finding in his favour over social work delays in dealing
with his complaint.
The Ombudsman last year recommended a payment of #1000 to Mr Morrison in
respect of the maladministration he had suffered.
Mr Morrison said: ``I feel relieved and delighted.
``I'd like to think for Lisa's sake that she's had some sort of legal claim.
She faces 20 years of plastic surgery.''
But he added bitterly: ``Social work knew I had gone out of my way to bring to
their attention what was going on with the mother. After the fire they were
trying to protect the department.
``They didn't want me to get the kids back home. They did everything in their
power to make me give up any thoughts of making a complaint. They are guilty as
sin.''
Mr Morrison has had his four children, eight-year-old Brian, seven-year-old
Clare, Louise, and Lisa, who are six and five respectively, back home with him
for nearly three years.
Lisa, who had drug withdrawal symptoms when born, was three months old when the
fire took place in February 4, 1991, at the home of her mother from whom Mr
Morrison was separated.
Three months earlier the children had been placed on the at risk register
because of concern about the use of drugs by their mother.
Following the fire the children were taken into care by the authority despite
Mr Morrison's request that they be placed in his care.
In February 1992, Mr Morrison wrote a letter to the social work district
manager at Glasgow North East complaining about lack of co-operation from the
department.
Following a reply to his concerns, Mr Morrison submitted a formal appeal
through the council's complaints procedure on April 21, 1992, and that appeal
has only now been concluded.
The complaints sub-committee found that the social work department was aware of
the mother's drug problem. While the sub-committee accepted the department had
no direct evidence of drug taking, there would appear to have been a reluctance
by the social worker involved in the case to seek evidence.
The sub-committee found with concern that when it did become apparent that
there was some cause for concern about the mother's lethargy on January 24,
1991, evening visits were ruled out and in fact there were no visits by social
workers between January 29 and February 4.
In addition, it found that social work staff should have done more to highlight
Lisa's medical condition when Mr Morrison was seeking accommodation.
The sub-committee recommended that while the social work department had no hard
evidence of the mother misusing drugs in the past, it was felt the monitoring
team should have included someone with training or knowledge of drugs issues
who could have worked with home support workers and offered them advice.
It further called on the social work department to review procedures where
drugs misuse is suspected so as to allow for ``out of hours visits''.
No-one was available yesterday from the social work department for comment.

Moscow, Monday
RESIDENTS of Gudermes, who fled Chechnya's second city in 11 days of fighting
between Russian troops and separatist rebels, started to return cautiously
today to bury their dead.
The bodies of two Russian women lay unburied on the snow near the local
military headquarters, where fighting had been intense. Other neighbours were
busy pushing handcarts loaded with food and other goods looted from shops.
Not far away, people found the badly mutilated bodies of four Chechens with
signs of torture. People who survived the days of fighting in basements accused
Russian soldiers of killing the four on December 21.
Fighting in Gudermes began on December 14 when about 800 rebels seized the
town, 20 miles east of the regional capital Grozny, trapping more than 100
Russian soldiers around the railway station and military headquarters.
Itar-Tass news agency quoted a Russian commander as saying 267 Chechens had
been killed.
A military spokesman told Interfax news agency that out of 37 Russian
servicemen missing in action, the bodies of 32 had been found ``mutilated
beyond recognition''.
q The Communist Party was well ahead of its nearest rival in Russia's
parliamentary election, according to full preliminary results issued by the
Central Electoral Commission tonight.
The Communist Party won 22.31% of votes in the party list contest for half of
450 seats in the State Duma lower house, the results showed. The other 225 Duma
seats were decided in single-candidate constituencies where the communists also
led strongly.-Reuter.

TURKISH Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, beaten by the pro-Islamic Welfare Party in
yesterday's general elections, resigned today and made overtures to a
conservative rival to keep the Islamists out of power.
A spokesman for President Suleyman Demirel said Ciller had resigned along with
her cabinet but would stay in office until a new government was formed.
``If necessary, we will not be the ones to stand in the way of a coalition with
(conservative Motherland Party) Anap,'' Ciller told a news conference before
she resigned.
The Welfare Party (RP) was confirmed as the winner of the elections with 21.32%
of the vote, state television TRT-1 said. It was the first victory at general
polls for an Islamist party in Turkey's 72-year history as a secular republic.
But Welfare fell well short of an absolute majority and may have trouble
finding a coalition partner in the two largest secularist parties.
``As the situation looks today, it is not possible for us to form a government
with RP,'' Anap leader Mesut Yilmaz said in remarks carried by Anatalian news
agency.
Under Turkey's proportional representation system RP looks set to get 158
seats, Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) 135 seats and Anap 132 seats.
The other seats in the 550-member parliament were filled by the social
democratic Democratic Left Party, with 75 MPs, and the Republican People's
Party, with 50.
Ciller and Anap, long-time bitter adversaries, could block the Islamists if
they formed a coalition that the business world has called for as a way to deal
with economic ills such as 80% annual inflation and a stumbling privatisation
plan.
Such an alliance would still need the support of one of the two social
democratic parties to command a majority, possibly leading to an unwieldy
right-left government. The early polls were called after Ciller's coalition
with the social democrats collapsed in September.
Turkish markets today tumbled on news of the Welfare victory, with the Istanbul
stock index closing down 6.5% after initially falling 9.4% in the morning
session.
The Turkish lira weakened against the US dollar to 58,750 lira from Friday's
57,580 close, after a low of 59,300. The central bank raised its lending rate
to 110% from Friday's 100% to curb the lira's fall.
RP leader Necmettin Erbakan told an afternoon news conference that he expected
to be given the mandate to form a new government, despite speculation that
Demirel might pass over Welfare to one of the conservative parties.
``As a requirement of democracy Demirel will give the right to form a
government to the party with the most votes . . . and we will go and speak to
other parties about a coalition,'' Erbakan said as supporters chanted his name.
Erbakan's party platform calls for a renegotiation of Turkey's customs union
with the European Union, which is set to take effect at the start of the year,
an end to interest rates and closer ties with Muslim nations.
He also favours pulling Turkey out of Nato and forming an ``Islamic common
market''.
``They have talked about a lot of things, but even if Erbakan succeeds in
forming a government it will be a coalition so he won't have the power to
drastically change things,'' said Sami Kohen, foreign affairs columnist for the
daily Milliyet.
The Welfare victory was welcomed by Tehran. The Islamic republic's state-run
radio said it was likely to shift Ankara's policies to a more pro-Islamic
stand.
RP was aided by the failure of the Kurdish People's Democracy Party (Hadep) to
win 10% of the nationwide vote needed to qualify for parliament. Seats Hadep
would have won in the mainly Kurdish southeast will pass mostly to the
Islamists. -Reuter.

CROONER, actor, and hellraiser Dean Martin always felt he had a long road to
travel.
He was born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 17, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, the son
of an Italian immigrant barber.
Martin worked in the steel mills, fought as a welterweight, and at 16 delivered
bootleg liquor around Steubenville. He also dealt cards in a gambling room
behind a cigar store and began singing in clubs.
A bandleader named Sammy Watkins hired the young singer and renamed him Dean
Martin. He eventually was booked into New York where his loose, mellow style
began to attract audiences.
In 1946, Martin began singing in the 500 Club in Atlantic City, New Jersey, at
$500 a week. Sharing the bill was a comedian named Jerry Lewis who did a
``record act'' - mouthing the lyrics to records by famous singers.
``We started horsing around with each other's act,'' Martin recalled. ``We'd do
anything that came to our minds, anything at all.''
The zaniness caught on, and soon they were playing New York's Copacabana at
$5000 a week. Nightclub and television offers followed, along with a movie
contract.
They starred in a string of comedies, including That's My Boy, Sailor Beware,
The Stooge, and Pardners. By the time of their last film, Hollywood or Bust, in
1956, the two were quarrelling in print. Martin quit the act.
``I was doing nothing and I was eating my heart out,'' he said. ``I sang a song
and never got to finish it. The camera would switch to Jer doing funny things.
Everything was Jerry Lewis, Jerry Lewis, and I was the straight man.''
Having broken up the top billing act in 1957, Martin was expected to flop as a
solo performer. However, after a shaky start with the film Ten Thousand
Bedrooms, he went on to become an even bigger star.
His big break came with the 1958 war drama The Young Lions, which also starred
Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. He went on to play a string of hard
drinkers in films such as Rio Bravo and The Sons of Katie Elder, in both of
which he starred with John Wayne.
He once cited the two greatest turning points in his career: ``First, meeting
Jerry Lewis. Second, leaving Jerry Lewis. I became a real actor because of
those two things.''
With stardom came membership in the Rat Pack, the Hollywood boys' club that
included Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr, and Peter Lawford, with John F.
Kennedy, Lawford's brother-in-law, an honorary member.
He continued singing, and topped the charts in 1964 with Everybody Needs
Somebody.
Then he conquered television. In 1965 came The Dean Martin Show, a musical
variety hour through which Martin ambled with customary ease, often pretending
to be drunk. The spontaneous appearance of the show was real. Martin's contract
stipulated that he would appear only on the day of the show and have the most
rudimentary of rehearsals.
In the 1970s and 80s, as Martin's film and television careers waned, he
continued to be a top attraction as a singer in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
On stage, he often sipped from a glass, adding to his reputation as a drinker.
Sinatra and other friends claimed Martin's drinking was exaggerated on purpose.
Martin himself said he never drank to excess: ``I never get drunk because I
can't face the consequences. I don't like to be sick.''
Martin married three times. In 1940 he wed Betty McDonald; they divorced after
nine years and four children. His second marriage, to Jeanne Riegger, lasted 23
years.
One son, Dean Paul, was killed in a National Guard jet crash in 1987. Martin
was said never to have got over his death.
In 1973, Martin, then 55, married former model Catherine Mae Hawn, 25.
After a lifetime of good health, Martin ran into troubles in his 70s. In 1988,
he dropped out of a tour with Sinatra and Davis because of a kidney condition.
In 1991, he cancelled an Atlantic City engagement because of what was described
as intestinal flu.
Tumours were found in his lungs in 1993 and he spent long spells in the Cedars
Sinai Hospital in Beverly Hills.
He once discharged himself from hospital saying: ``If I'm gonna to go, I'll go
with a glass in my hand.''

Madrid, Monday
TWO train drivers were killed when a landslide derailed a Spanish express train
early today and sent the locomotive and first wagon plunging down a ravine, a
spokesman for the state rail service RENFE said.
More than 200 other people aboard the Barcelona-Malaga-Seville express escaped
unhurt, the spokesman told Reuters.
The train left the track at about 4am in Despenaperros national park near
Linares, about 170 miles south of Madrid, the spokesman said. Heavy rains
recently in the region had caused the landslide, he added.
Eight wagons carrying around 220 people and an unspecified number of cars were
perched over the rocky ravine after the locomotive and the first wagon, which
was loaded with motor cars, fell into the darkness.
Eight people were slightly injured and were taken to hospitals in Valdepenas
and Linares. All but one were discharged shortly afterwards, the RENFE
spokesman said.
One was transferred to a Cordoba hospital to be treated for a brain injury, a
spokesman at the San Agustin Hospital in Linares told Reuters.
Juan Sanchez, 19, who was travelling on the express, said most of the
passengers were asleep when the accident happened and that they had remained
calm and avoided panic during the evacuation.
Nearly all continued their journey by bus.
Train services to the southern cities of Almeria, Granada, Jaen, Malaga,
Seville and Cadiz were disrupted as rail workers repaired the line.
They were not expected to resume for between 24 and 48 hours and RENFE was
providing alternative travel routes.-Reuter.

hostile reactions to their proposal for a Scottish parliament which have
emerged from some English Labour MPs.
Mr Tony Blair remains committed to introducing devolution Bills for Scotland
and Wales in the first session of the next parliament, if Labour wins the
General Election.
However, some Labour MPs are threatening to make trouble, unless their areas
receive similar consideration.
A group of northern English MPs has written to Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw
calling on him to see that their region does not lose out because of the powers
being offered to a Scottish executive and parliament.
Until now the northern MPs have not sought a parliament with legislative powers
for their region. But they are particularly concerned that a Scottish executive
with its own funds to attract inward investment might be able to outbid English
regions for key projects.
One, Mr John McWilliam (Blaydon) has already said that, unless he received
assurances about this, he would table amendments designed to protect the
position of his region. Other English Labour MPs are unhappy at the prospect of
much of Labour's first year in power being taken up with a highly controversial
piece of legislation which does not affect England.
The promise of development agencies for each English region might appease many
of the doubters. The leadership is also likely to offer to set up regional
bodies of, initially, nominated councillors to take over the functions of many
of the bigger quangos in each region.
One bright spot for them is that, on current opinion poll indications, Labour
could well win a Commons majority big enough to free it from dependency on the
Liberal Demo-crats and smaller parties.

STAGECOACH, one of the biggest beneficiaries of Conservative bus deregulation
and last week's successful bidder for a British Rail franchise, has mounted an
anti-Budget campaign, but without the chairman's knowledge.
It has produced a poster blaming the Budget for fare rises and urging
passengers to write to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to oppose increases in
diesel fuel tax.
The Stagecoach bills, displayed on buses on routes where fares have been
increased, have irritated the Scottish Conservative Party.
Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst said: ``This is a surprising reaction. Bus
fares have remained highly competitive as a result of deregulation, a policy
which has helped companies like Stagecoach to prosper.''
However, a spokesman for Stagecoach explained that the company management
structure was decentralised, and that top management had no knowledge of the
posters.
Stagecoach chairman Brian Souter said: ``I am unaware of this and I will launch
an investigation into how it came about.
``It is certainly not Stagecoach policy to attack the Government. We appreciate
the opportunities that deregulation gave us.''
But Mr Souter added that the company supported the bus industry campaign to
have diesel fuel tax refunded to bus companies.
The Stagecoach posters have attracted the support of at least one Conservative.
Mr Bill Walker, the maverick MP for North Tayside, and a former director of the
Perth-based firm, said: ``I am not at all surprised by this. When a tax
increase is imposed, it is inevitably passed on to the consumer. That is a fact
of life.''
He added: ``Stagecoach have not been the beneficiaries of Conservative policy.
It has simply made use of the market. ``They took the risk and the opportunity
and made it pay to the benefit of the consumers who now benefit from riding
around in nice new buses.''
The poster, headlined Travel News, advises: ``Following the Budget increase of
14p per gallon on diesel fuel tax, some of our fares will have to rise.''
It continues: ``This diesel tax will be paid direct to the Government and the
bus company will not benefit in any way.
``We are sorry that the Budget has forced us to raise fares but we have no
alternative but to implement this increase.''
It then suggests that passengers should send their comments to the Chancellor
and prints his full postal address.
The fare rises introduced on some routes have been by as little as five pence,
taking a single fare from Perth to Crieff from #1.95p to #2.
Stagecoach, Britain's biggest bus company, id headed by sister and brother Ann
Gloag and Brian Souter. It made profits last year of #32.6m.
The company is no stranger to controversy and has been criticised in the past
for its aggressive expansion methods.

DOLE office workers collapsed with laughter when a man applied on behalf of his
incapacitated live-in lover . . . for ``infidelity benefit''.
Hundreds of others got it wrong, according to civil servants.
The anecdotes have been compiled by staff at the Government's JobCentre and
Benefits Agency for their union, the Civil and Public Services Association.
They include the jobseeker who ``applied to be a window fitter at Emperor
Windows but fell through'' and another, from Colchester, who was ``furtively
seeking employment''.
A nursing home worker in Long Eaton, Warwickshire, left his job because he
found the work too ``monogamous''.
Another jobseeker in Cambridge had been trying to find work through
advertisements and ``by word of ear''.
Many claimants apply for benefits after suffering the most bizarre illnesses.
One person in Leigh, Lancashire, had ``deceased lungs'' which could be similar
to the ``collapsed lounge'' affecting a man in Newquay.
An Oldham man could not keep his appointment with Benefits Agency staff because
he was suffering from ``jet leg'' after his holiday.
Another could not be traced at all because he had left his parents' home in
Boscombe, Dorset, and left ``no foreboding address''.
Asked where he was willing to travel to work, one Scot replied: ``Anywhere in
the world, between Glasgow and Manchester''.
A more adventurous applicant in south London replied: ``Australia, Canada,
Japan, Hong Kong, South Africa, or anywhere in Europe, except Yorkshire.''
One hotel manager in Castle Douglas, Kirkcudbrightshire, explaining a
dismissal, wrote: ``She was employed as a waitress but was incapable of the
job. She was transferred to the bedroom to give her another chance but she
never showed any interest so she was dismissed.''
In some instances staff are not sure whether the applicant is displaying a
subtle sense of humour.
A Merthyr Tydfil claimant who was late explained in his letter: ``My flat burnt
down yesterday and I'm fuming.''
In answer to the question ``If you have not worked for the whole of the last 12
months, what else have you been doing?'' a Spalding woman simply wrote
``watching television''.
A spokeswoman for the CPSA said: ``There are occasions when it is hard to tell
if people are supremely ironic or misunderstand the question.''
There was the Manchester man who, when asked for his position in his
organisation, replied ``in the office above the shop''.

THE missionary nun singled out by the Queen in her Christmas speech said
yesterday: ``Don't compare me to Mother Teresa''.
Sister Ethel Normoyle, who has dedicated the last seven years to helping the
poor in a shanty town in South Africa, said she was ``delighted'' to be
mentioned in the televised Christmas message.
But she said: ``I don't think I would want any symbolism to Mother Teresa. We
have just both shared in the theme of the poverty of people.
``We are just trying to do what everybody here is doing - to reach out to
people who are broken and repressed.
``I'm just trying to do my bit to bring the compassion of Christ to people.
``The more you are involved in their lives, you become very aware of the
poverty and suffering.''
The Queen met the 50-year-old nun, from Liscasey, County Clare, in the west of
the Irish Republic, when she visited the newly democratised South Africa in
March.
The Queen used the occasion to see the work of the Little Company of Mary in
Missionvale, near Port Elizabeth, where Sister Ethel and her colleagues give
hope and support to thousands of people.
Sister Ethel described her feelings on the day the Queen and her entourage
called at Missionvale's school and clinic.
``To be truthful when she got out of the car I wanted to hug her and I had to
hold back not to,'' Sister Ethel said.
``She's a lovely person and I felt very relaxed with her. She gave me the
impression that the people at that moment were so important to her.''
Sister Ethel also praised the Princess of Wales's campaigning for disadvantaged
groups in Britain.
``I have great admiration for her - she's really caring and has great
compassion about her for those who are broken,'' she said.
Sister Ethel said her ambition was to continue her work, ``being part of the
lives here as long as I can be''.
Working amid such disadvantage, Sister Ethel said, required people to open
their hearts and be prepared to face feeling uncomfortable at what they saw.
But despite yesterday's royal recognition it was not always sunshine and
happiness in the township.
At the shanty-town of shacks cobbled together from salvaged corrugated iron,
wood, and plastic sheeting there is 85% unemployment and diseases such as
tuberculosis are on the increase.
Through Sister Ethel's hard work and tenacity, and her belief that good would
overcome evil, she has now built a pre-school and clinic for children and
teenagers who missed out on formal education.
The Queen remembered her work as ``a glowing example of how the inspiration and
energy of one person can benefit thousands of others''.
Sister Ethel, who likes to wear black trainers with her navy-blue nun's habit
and light blue veil, said she had started Christmas Day with a Mass and would
sit down with her colleagues for a traditional dinner.
Later they would sit back and watch the Queen's tribute to their work, she said.
In a seasonal message to her family and friends back home by the west coast of
Ireland - she has not had the opportunity to visit for three years - she said:
``To all my family, the blessing of Christmas and of Christ, and may each of
them be able to experience His peace and love.''

POPE John Paul II, suffering from a fever, curtailed his annual Christmas
message to crowds in St Peter's Square yesterday after breathing a deep sigh
and letting his head drop.
He had earlier missed celebrating Christmas Mass because of his illness.
The 75-year-old pontiff had just finished his ``Urbi et Orbi'' (To the City and
the World) address to crowds in St Peter's Square and was beginning his
Christmas greetings in dozens of languages. He was giving the French salutation
when he paused and hung his head.
``I can't go on. Merry Christmas and God bless,'' he said in Italian before
quickly turning back into his residence.
The extent of the Pope's illness was not immediately clear. Earlier, papal
spokesman Joaquin Navarro described the illness as ``slight''. Doctors advised
the Pope to rest after he felt tired and feverish following the long midnight
Mass.
Navarro said the Pope was taking the ``normal medication'' for a fever,
including aspirin.
It was the first time the Pope had missed leading the Christmas Mass since
assuming the papacy in 1978. Taking his place on the flower-ringed altar was
Cardinal Virgilio Noe, the vicar general for the Vatican city-state.
The pontiff's health has appeared to be improving in recent months following a
long recovery from hip replacement surgery in 1994. He no longer uses a cane
and has appeared in good spirits in recent public appearances.
In his address, the Pope decried the misery across ``this hurt world'' from
Bosnia's refugees to Iraqis suffering under a UN-imposed trade embargo.
Looking out over the square on a warm and rainy day, the pope drew a parallel
between those suffering in the world today and the story of the quest to find a
place for the birth of Jesus Christ.
``In the great inn of the whole human community, as well as in the little inn
of our hearts, how many poor people even today, at the threshold of the year
2000, come to knock,'' the Pope said.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth should do more to support Scotland's film
industry in Europe, the STUC said yesterday.
It urged him to intervene at Cabinet level to persuade Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
the Secretary of State for National Heritage, to think again about the
Government's withdrawal from the Council of Europe scheme, Eurimages, which
encourages co-production in feature film and documentary and supports European
distribution.
The withdrawal from the scheme was announced as part of the Budget proposals.
Mary Picken, the STUC arts officer, said the announcement had come without
warning or consultation and at a time when the Scottish Secretary had been
making a lot of noise about his own desire to promote the film industry in
Scotland.
Yet Scottish-based companies which had been hopeful of receiving money from
Eurimages - for the first time since Britain had joined in 1993 - had had their
hopes dashed.
"The potential for developing partnerships with other European film-makers had
disappeared ``like snow off a dyke'', she said.  ``While we have come to expect
empty rhetoric from this Government in terms of its support for the film
industry, we did not expect the Government to slash what little support it
gives,'' Ms Picken said.
The STUC said that the Government contribution to Eurimages in 1995/96 was
around #2.6m. The fund had invested in 56 films since Britain joined the scheme
in April 1993.
A Scottish Office spokes-woman said last night that Mr Forsyth would give full
consideration to the STUC's proposal.

THE Road Haulage Association has accused some fuel companies of charging the
industry more for diesel than it cost at garages, and has urged the Scottish
Office to investigate.
Its regional director, Mr Wylie Cunningham, said the firms involved were guilty
of ``questionable marketing policies''.
He said: ``Throughout Scotland at the moment, it is possible to pull into a
garage or filling station and buy diesel for less per litre than the same
companies are currently charging hauliers when we buy it bulk.
``For example, just before Christmas, I bought 20 litres of diesel at a filling
station in the Glasgow area, and it cost 48.9p per litre. Yet I have a copy of
a note from the very same fuel company, confirming an order from one of my
members for 28,000 litres of diesel, at a cost of 53.12p per litre.''
He said it was the ``economics of the madhouse'' and pointed out that fuel
prices accounted for 25% of the operating costs of heavy goods vehicles.

Sarajevo, Monday
BOSNIA celebrated its first Christmas at peace for four years today but a
machine gun attack on a British military helicopter over Bosnian Croat
territory angered Nato peacekeepers.
The incident on Christmas eve marred otherwise cheerful festivities with
Sarajevans packing the city's Roman Catholic for a midnight mass and army cooks
working flat out to serve traditional turkey dinners to Nato troops.
``You can tell it's really peace now because people are on the street at night
and there is no fear,'' said Amela, a 24-year-old Sarajevo student as she
strolled with her boyfriend.
``Everyone is very relaxed. It's a real holiday even for Muslims like me. We're
all celebrating Christmas and the end of the war tonight.''
The British Lynx helicopter safely dodged a hostile burst of fire over the
central Bosnian town of Jajce in the fifth such attack since Nato took over
from UN peacekeepers on December 21.
``The helicopter took evasive action. This is being treated as deliberate
fire,'' Nato spokesman Colonel Mark Rayner told reporters.
Jajce is a Bosnian Croat stronghold but Colonel Rayner did not attribute blame
for the incident though he stressed that ``our view remains that (such firing)
is ill-disciplined and unacceptable''.
Nato has threatened to be tougher towards attacks on its forces than the UN
peacekeepers who were accused of being too lenient towards ceasefire violations.
The first known fatality of the Nato operation occurred at Nato's Sarajevo
headquarters where a British soldier was found dead from a gunshot wound.
A spokesman called the death of Signalman Mark Maxwell, 22, yesterday an
apparent suicide.
The alliance pressed ahead on Christmas Day with its deployment of 60,000
troops to cement peace ending Europe's worst conflict in half a century that
killed 200,000 people and displaced up to three million.
The US Navy began its first big land contribution for the Nato peace
implementation operation in Bosnia, sending a construction party by road from
Taszar air base in southern Hungary.
Bad weather and communications have hampered the start of deployment of land
troops from bases in Hungary, who are supposed to build a bridge across the
River Sava from Croatia into Bosnia before deploying around their base at Tuzla.
Outside Sarajevo, British soldiers raucously sang carols to celebrate Christmas
beside their guns which helped stop the slaughter in Bosnia. The 105mm guns
took out Serb positions during Nato airstrikes in August and September.
British military padre Daniel Merceron lit a peace candle at a Christmas
service for soldiers in Sarajevo's Zetra stadium, built for the 1984 Winter
Olympics.
Another cause for celebration was a prisoner exchange between Bosnian
government and Serb forces at Doboj in the north yesterday. The gesture was
matched in Sarajevo, where Muslim-led government forces vacated some of the
most contested frontline positions in 43 months of war.-Reuter.

DETECTIVES in Kilmarnock spent yesterday sifting through information gathered
from more than 2000 people questioned during a reconstruction of the last
movements of murdered teenager Mhairi Julyan.
Pedestrians and motorists were stopped and spoken to between Kilmarnock's
London Road and Mhairi's home in Samson Avenue in a five-hour operation on
Saturday night.
Shortly after 9pm, murder squad policewoman Julie O'Neill, 28, set off from the
town's Palace Theatre where Mhairi had been to see the pantomime a week
earlier. The policewoman, who bears a resemblance to the dead girl, wore
clothes identical to those worn by Mhairi that night.
Although police said they were satisfied with the response, they are still
waiting for a crucial breakthrough to lead them to the killer.
The man leading the hunt, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder, said yesterday
his officers had been out interviewing people during the day. ``We've been
visiting people in their homes. Just because it's Christmas does not mean the
operation can come to a stop.''
He said the response from the community had been tremendous and more than 2000
people had filled out questionnaires..
``Although we have had some sightings of other people, what we really need are
confirmed sightings of Mhairi along that route. It is particularly frustrating
and time consuming but everything's got to be done slowly and meticulously to
make sure we get the right results.''
Police are also studying reports of obscene phone calls made to Mhairi's
friends shortly before her killing. They are also investigating a claim that a
youth was behaving strangely on London Road.
Prayers were said yesterday for the family of the teenager by churches
throughout the local presbytery.

THERESA Miller has only one wish for the new year - an end to her 15-year wait
for a new kidney.
She is believed to have endured one of the longest waits in the UK for a
transplant. Today, while most people tuck into a second day of festive fare,
she has to stick to her limited diet.
``Mince pies are out. So are Christmas pudding, chocolates, crisps, peanuts and
other treats most people take for granted,'' she said.
``My kidneys just would not cope with the levels of potassium in these foods
and so I make do with one tangerine and perhaps a tiny portion of trifle.
``It would be lovely if, just for a change, I had a Christmas like anyone else.
But what I miss most is a long drink of water. Like most kidney patients my
fluid intake is severely restricted because my body just could not cope.''
It is extremely difficult to find a kidney match because she has developed
anti-bodies which do not match most kidneys available for transplant.
She developed kidney failure at 17 and had an unsuccessful transplant at 20.
``That lasted three weeks,'' she said.
``And because of the anti-bodies, the specialists say I am difficult to match
..... but not impossible.''
Ms Miller, 35, is attached to a dialysis machine at Crosshouse Hospital in Ayr
for about 16 hours each week, waiting for the call that would change her life.
Dr Brian Junor, consultant nephrologist at Glasgow West Hospitals, said: ``It
is proving extremely difficult to find a good match for Theresa because she has
a high level of anti-bodies, but we believe that one does exist.
``It is because of patients like her that we appeal to the population to carry
donor cards or register for donation. Above all, we ask people to discuss
donation with their families and let their feelings be known.''
Ms Miller said: ``Kidney failure has limited my horizons. But you have to
remain optimistic if you are to survive. I am lucky to be alive even if I am
tied to a machine year after year.
``It would be easy to feel resentful but that would eventually destroy me. You
cannot go on wishing life had been different.
``The trick in my situation is to keep smiling.''

<HEADLINE>Lord Advocate asked to resist release of Lockerbie suspect</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>974700566</RECORDNO>

PRESSURE was growing on the Lord Advocate last night to step into the row over
the planned release from prison of a key suspect in the Lockerbie bombing who
is to be freed under a secret deal between the Iranian and German governments.
Dr Jim Swire, spokesman for the 270 victims of the disaster, said he firmly
believed the man at the centre of the diplomatic row, Palestinian terrorist
Hafez Dalkamoni and his gang, were the prime movers behind the bombing.
Dr Swire, who lost his daughter Flora in the Lockerbie disaster, said Dalkamoni
should not be released from his German prison cell until a full investigation
into his involvement in Lockerbie was carried out and a full team of Scottish
police officers were allowed to interview him.
In light of the new developments Labour MP Tam Dalyell has written to the Lord
Advocate, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, making it clear that freeing Dalkamoni will
seriously undermine efforts to find out who was responsible for the disaster.
Mr Dalyell's letter asks five questions of the Lord Advocate including whether
he would talk to the German authorities before the release of Dalkamoni,
whether the Germans had contacted Scottish police about his release, and
whether the Government would now be in touch with the German government on the
matter.
Dalkamoni and his accomplice, Abdel Ghadanfar, led a 14-strong Palestinian cell
arrested in Frankfurt weeks before the disaster on December 21, 1988.
Dr Swire, who had made extensive inquiries into the case, said a tape recorder
made into a bomb was found in the boot of Dalkamoni's car. The timing mechanism
was set in motion by a drop in atmospheric pressure, conditions only to be
found in an aircraft as it attains altitude.
Dalkamoni and Ghadanfar were held in custody but the other members of the cell
were released and Dr Swire said he believed they were involved in planting a
suitcase laden with explosives on the jet at Frankfurt airport.
Dalkamoni was finally jailed in 1991 for 15 years for trying to blow up an
American military train but as part of the secret deal with Iran will be
released soon after serving less than a third of his sentence.
His accomplice in the plot to blow up the train, Abdel Ghadanfar, who was also
arrested at Frankfurt airport, was jailed for 12 years and released in secret
last year.
The controversial German deal with Iran follows a visit by their intelligience
chief, Ali Fallahian, to meet his German counterpart, Bernd Schmidbauer, in
late 1993.
Last night Dr Swire and Mr Dalyell called for immediate action by the Lord
Advocate to try and halt the release of Dalkamoni. Both said it was vital that
he was interviewed by Scottish police.
Dr Swire said the Government claim that two Libyans were behind the bombing
``may well be codswallop''.
Despite the Government insistence of the case against the Libyan pair, he said
he firmly believed that Dalkamoni and his gang were heavily involved in the
bombing.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night that once they had seen the
contents of Mr Dalyell's letter they would respond to it.

DEAN MARTIN, debonair entertainer and one of Hollywood's biggest stars, died at
his Beverly Hills home yesterday. He was 78.
The singer and actor, who was a leading member of Hollywood's Rat Pack and
famous for his hard-living image, died of acute respiratory failure, his agent,
Mort Viner, said.
Martin rose to fame as straight man to comedian Jerry Lewis before launching
successfully on his own.
With stardom came membership of the Rat Pack, the ``club'' that included Frank
Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr, and Peter Lawford, with John F Kennedy, Lawford's
brother-in-law, as an honorary member.
``Dean was my brother - not through blood, but through choice,'' Sinatra said
yesterday. ``Good times and bad, we were there for each other.
``Our friendship has travelled down many roads over the years, and there will
always be a special place in my heart and soul for Dean.''
For an untrained actor who could not dance, read a note of music, or write his
songs, Martin's fame was almost effortless.
``Everybody loves a drunk,'' he once said, explaining how his shabby on-stage
demeanour and low-brow jokes won over the hearts and minds of the world.
His smooth baritone and comic talent also brought him success in the charts,
with a No 1 in 1964 and on television with a number of popular shows.
Among Martin's films were Some Came Running, Rio Bravo, Who Was that Lady,
Sergeants Three, Toys in the Attic, Kiss Me Stupid, The Bells Are Ringing, The
Sons of Katie Elder, The Silencers, Texas Across the River, Murderer's Row, and
Airport.
The son of an Italian immigrant barber, he was born Dino Crocetti in
Steubenville, Ohio, on June 17, 1917. He worked as a boxer and steelworker
before becoming a bar-room singer and changing his name to Dean Martin.

Durban, Monday
AT least 14 people were killed in a Christmas Day massacre in South Africa when
warriors of the Inkatha Freedom Party raided rivals in the African National
Congress, police said.
They said more than 500 men armed with spears, axes and guns swept through
Shobashobane settlement in the south coast region of KwaZulu-Natal province at
8am today, killing, burning and looting.
``The death toll has now risen to 14 and most of the victims were stabbed and
hacked to death,'' said Captain Shaun von Vollenhoven, commander of the police
station at nearby Izingolweni, adding that another 20 people had been wounded.
Superintendent Jeff Cromhout, a member of the riot squad unit sent to restore
calm, said: ``It's a sick way to spend Christmas.''
The attack, the third mass killing in the province in 11 days, was launched in
defiance of a security force crackdown and a renewed peace initiative this
month by ANC leader President Nelson Mandela and his IFP counterpart Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
Frank Mdlalose, Inkatha premier of the province, condemned the latest massacre.
``The burning of houses and loss of lives is something which is horrifying, it
is terrible, happening on Christmas Day. It is one of the worst massacres we
have had,'' he said.
ANC spokesman Dumisane Makhaye said Mdlalose, who is also in charge of policing
at a provincial level, bore ultimate reponsibility for failing to halt the
violence.
Von Vollenhoven said the 50 remaining residents of Shobashobane had been moved
to another, safer area.
``We are busy bussing the ANC supporters out of the area to a temporary refugee
camp near Port Shepstone.  I am forecasting a quiet night because there will be
no people in the area and all the property there has been destroyed or looted.
The attack was obviously very well-planned,'' he said.
Von Vollenhoven said no arrests had yet been made but roadblocks had been set
up and security force reinforcements had been sent in, some by helicopter.
In previous political attacks in the south coast area this month, 10 people
were killed in an Inkatha zone on December 15 and nine people, four of them
children, were killed in an ANC zone four days later.
Fighting between followers of Mandela and Buthelezi has eased since all-race
elections in April last year. But a group that monitors violence, the Human
Rights Committee, said before the three recent massacres that 757 people had
died in political conflict in the province this year. -Reuter.

ONE of Scotland's leading trade unionists, Mr Harry McLevy, has died.
Mr McLevy, 59, was a former president of the STUC and was Scottish regional
secretary of the Amalgamated Electrical and Engineering Union.
He collapsed and died at his home in Glasgow on Christmas Eve.
Articulate, and a traditional-style left-winger, he was heavily involved in the
campaign for a Scottish assembly and worked to increase the role of the STUC in
Scottish life.
He entered the engineering union as an apprentice in the Lobnitz yard in
Renfrew where he took part in the famous apprentices' strike of Clydeside
shipyard youths of the fifties that first propelled young union leaders Jimmy
Reid and Jimmy Airlie to fame.
A proud Dundonian, he returned to his native city and eventually worked in the
Robb Caledon shipyard where he became shop stewards' convener then president of
the Dundee district committee of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers.
At the same time he was prominent in communist politics. He was a long-standing
communist candidate in both council and parliamentary elections. He served on
the party's Scottish and British executive committees.
He was a key figure in the development of the shop stewards' movement in Dundee
and in their use of occupations to oppose closures and redundancies.
The tactic was used in the Robb Caledon sit-in in 1980 and in later occupations
of the Smith Hutton shipyard, Landis and Gyr engineering factory, and the Timex
plant at Milton of Craigie.
In 1984, he was elected Scottish regional secretary of his union and took a
leading role in the STUC.
Mr McLevy is survived by his wife Doris and his four children Graham, Susan,
Sean, and Kevin, by a previous marriage.

DETECTIVES seeking a missing 19-year-old French student are becoming
pessimistic about her safety.
They fear Miss Celine Figard could have been abducted by a lorry driver who
gave her a lift from a motorway service area near Newbury, Berkshire, and has
not come forward, despite appeals for him to do so.
It is a week since she left France to journey to England to spend Christmas
with her cousin at a hotel in New Forest, Hampshire. Last Tuesday she was given
a lift from the Chieveley service area at the junction of the M4 and A34 by a
driver who said she could use the telephone in his cab to call her cousin.
The driver was to take her to Salisbury, Wiltshire, where she planned to get a
bus to Fordingbridge, Hampshire, and work over Christmas as a waitress at the
hotel where her cousin is head waiter. But the accountancy student did not
arrive and neither was any call received by her cousin.
In the next few days thousands of posters showing a picture of the missing
woman and a video-fit of the driver are to be distributed.
The driver is described as white, 30-35, with short fair hair and a cropped
beard, but no moustache, and wearing a grey sweatshirt or pullover.
Police say it is totally out of character for Celine not to keep in touch with
her family and there is no reason for her to disappear.

A LIGHTHOUSE keeper stranded in an Army bothy for 20 hours by the snow was
rescued by helicopter yesterday just in time to cook Christmas dinner for his
colleagues manning the Cape Wrath lighthouse.
Mr Donald Maciver, one of three keepers on duty at the lighthouse on the most
northerly point on the Scottish mainland, described how he had set out on
Christmas Eve to collect the mail.
His Land Rover skidded off the road and the 44-year-old married relief keeper,
based in Edinburgh, headed for a Ministry of Defence bothy to phone for help.
``I phoned the boys at the lighthouse and one of them, Jimmy Dickson, came out
in a tractor but got stuck after driving six miles. He had to walk back to the
lighthouse in the snow.
``I was making my way back to the Land Rover to meet him but the snow was
falling hard and it was up to my chest. I did the sensible thing and went back
to the hut.''
Mr Maciver, a lighthouse keeper for 21 years, consoled himself with dehydrated
Army rations, huddled round a heater, and phoned the coastguard, preparing for
a spartan Christmas Day. ``It was a terrible night. The bothy was vibrating as
the gale and     blizzards pounded it.''
Yesterday morning a Pentland coastguard search and rescue helicopter  was
diverted to pick him up, and ``dropped me off outside the lighthouse''.
He said he was unharmed by his ordeal and had been sent straight to the kitchen
by his colleagues to cook Christmas dinner.

TRAGIC Leah Betts, the girl who died after taking an ecstasy tablet on her
eighteenth birthday, has given the ``gift of sight and life'' to six people
through the donation of her organs.
``It's absolutely fantastic and I am so glad now that I carried out Leah's
wishes to donate her organs,'' her father Paul Betts said.
``Two women who hadn't seen for several years have each received one of her
eyes.
``Two men received her kidneys. One of them had been on dialysis for 11 years
and the other for nine years. One woman received her liver and another woman
received Leah's heart and lungs.''
Mr Betts said he did not know the identity of any of the recipients, but knew
that the woman who received Leah's heart was fit enough to go Christmas
shopping.
Immediately after Leah died last month, after the birthday party at home in
Latchingdon, Essex, Mr Betts voiced qualms about the notion of organ donation.
But he said he has been so won over by the idea that he was now a registered
donor himself.

<TEXT>
STOCKHOLM: Police investigating the murder of Swedish prime minister Olof Palme
almost 10 years ago said yesterday a new clue had been found in a bag
containing a gun of the type used to kill him. Police said the bag, which was
handed to police on Sunday by evening tabloid Aftonbladet, also contained a
piece of paper on which the words ``Forgive me, Lisbet'' were written.
Lisbet Palme was present when her husband was shot from behind on a Stockholm
street in February 1986. She was slightly injured. Police said earlier forensic
experts were examining the Smith &amp; Wesson .357 Magnum revolver found in the
bag, which was given to Aftonbladet by an anonymous informant. He said he found
it in a Stockholm lake that police had fruitlessly dredged for clues on several
occasions.
Storm victims
ALMATY: At least 21 people died of frostbite and many others were missing in
the vast Kazakh steppes when a powerful weekend snowstorm hit the eastern
Akmola region of the former Soviet republic, police said yesterday. The officer
said the search for other people who could have been caught by the storm during
which temperatures fell to minus 15 Celsius (5F) continued.
Hostage cards
PAHALGAM: The four Western hostages held by militants in Kashmir entered their
175th day in captivity yesterday, with Christmas cards to them lying
undelivered at the post office in this small town. Al-Faran guerrillas
kidnapped American Donald Hutchings, German Dirk Hasert and Britons Keith
Mangan and Paul Wells in early July while they were trekking in the mountains
of southern Kashmir. A fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was
found beheaded on August 13.
Heroin charge
BANGKOK: Two Britons are due to appear before a court in Bangkok to face drugs
charges later this week. Proceedings against Robert Lock and Sandra Gregory
have already lasted almost three years. Their trial has been repeatedly
adjourned over the last six months because of the failure of a potentially key
witness to attend court.
Crucial vote
JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres's coalition last night defeated
two no-confidence motions against returning the Golan Heights for peace with
Syria. The two motions by hardline political parties, put to a single vote in
the 120-seat Knesset (parliament), were defeated 56-48. The vote took place
after an Israeli delegation left for the United States for talks with longtime
foe Syria.
Flood deaths
RIO: At least two people died and hundreds were made homeless when heavy rain
caused flooding and mudslides in southern Brazil yesterday. Local television
said the city of Florianopolis, capital of Santa Catarina state, was worst hit
by the Christmas floods. Rescue workers said some people were still trapped in
collapsed homes and hundreds of families were being housed in schools and
churches. The TV showed footage of streets turned into raging rivers.
Crew missing
HONG KONG: A search was launched yesterday for 15 crew members of an Indonesian
ship which sank off the Philippines, the Hong Kong marine department said. The
pilot of a Hong Kong light aircraft, sent to the scene some 400 nautical miles
south of Hong Kong, reported two ships had picked up 11 members of the stricken
Andhika Wanatya. All 26 crew members of the 3890-ton ship are Indonesians, the
marine department said.
Premier `stable'
ATHENS: Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou was in a stable condition last night
and doctors said they had managed to cut back on their use of a respirator.
``Tests show that his condition is stabilised,'' said a statement by the
Onassis Cardiac Surgery Centre in Athens. A later statement said the
76-year-old premier's health was improving and that he was breathing without
the aid of a respirator. It added that he did not need kidney dialysis during
the day.
Briton jailed
MALAGA: Anthony Seddon, 31, a saloon car racing driver from Manchester, was
jailed for six years and seven months for trying to smuggle hashish worth
#240,000 by a court in Malaga, on Spain's Costa del Sol. Seddon was told of the
sentence on Christmas Eve in Malaga prison where he has been held since his
arrest in October last year. He was also fined #500,000.

<TEXT>
A PLANNED extension of Glasgow's controlled parking zone has met with
disapproval from the business community.
If the proposals by Strathclyde region are given the final go-ahead, it means
the present metered area will more than double.
Restrictions on street parking will be imposed as far west as the busy Park
Circus area and the Kelvin Hall, south across the Clyde to take in an area east
of the M8 towards Glasgow Green, and east of the Merchant City.
Last night, the scheme was sharply criticised by the business community, local
residents, and the RAC.
The CBI said it could discourage businesses from locating in the area and could
result in existing offices moving to avoid parking charges.
Assistant director Ron Gow said: ``It will certainly add to the running costs
that businesses face. The parking provision would still exist, but they would
have to start paying for it.''
The RAC said: ``We believe that this will be seen as a cynical attempt to milk
the motorist of more money.
``The effect will be to displace parking by commuters to other areas. Whether
the local authority likes it or not, a great many motorists will park where
they can for free.
``All that will happen will be increased pressure on adjoining areas. Many
businesses are attracted to areas where there is free parking and these
measures will do nothing for them or the small shops that rely on the business
community.''
However, the AA said there was a need to control all-day, on-street parking.
``We don't really see any need for long-term, free parking in the area close to
Charing Cross,'' a spokesman said.
``But having said that, there is a need to improve public transport using the
carrot approach rather than the stick. Too often we get enforcement before we
get the carrot.''
The proposals are certain to be approved by the new Glasgow authority and will
be phased in gradually after April.

<HEADLINE>Royals show impressive display of family unity at church service without the Princess of Wales Queen's tribute to the peacemakers</HEADLINE>

THE Queen paid tribute yesterday to the peacemakers in her Christmas broadcast
which was filmed at Sandringham. Wearing red and looking relaxed she made no
mention of the troubles which have beset her family during the year.
The film accompanying her broadcast included scenes from the celebrations
marking the 50th anniversary of VE Day and VJ Day, and the Queen said that the
Second World War had required tremendous sacrifice from those who gave their
services and in many cases their lives or health so the rest of us could enjoy
the freedom to get on with our lives in peace. ``The work for peace is never
ending,'' she added.
Then she spoke of the thousands of Commonwealth men and women who are taking
part in the international peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia and also
those closer to home in Northern Ireland. But it was the work of those who went
unnoticed and unsung by the world at large she particularly praised.
She said that when the fighting ceased, the work of reconciliation and
reconstruction could begin.
The royal family, without the Princess of Wales, had earlier staged an
impressive display of family unity when they attended the traditional Christmas
service at Sandringham.
But if there was no mention of the problems the royal family has faced,
particularly in recent days, the address could have a subtext. Would-be queens
of hearts could ponder that reference to the good work done by unsung and
unnoticed volunteers, and the Prince and Princess of Wales might reflect about
how after the fighting has ceased, the work of reconciliation and
reconstruction can begin.
The Queen also chose to hymn the praises of someone who has not courted
publicity, Sister Ethel. She met her at her mission near Port Elizabeth during
her South African tour. It was the volunteers and the Sister Ethels of this
world who spread the Christmas message of peace and goodwill among men, she
said. It was for the rest of us to welcome it.
``Christ said, `Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the
children of God','' she said. ``Thanks to the peacemakers many millions in the
world will enjoy a better Christmas this year. I hope your Christmas will be a
happy one. God bless you all.''
Whether her own peacemaking efforts, when she sent her letters to her son and
daughter-in-law last week urging them to divorce and end their fighting, were
in her mind she did not say. But she could hardly have been unaware of the
parallels between real life and what she was saying.
At Sandringham the Queen Mother made only her second public appearance since
her hip replacement operation in a brilliant blue coat. Her left leg bandaged,
she carried two walking sticks but walked unaided into the church.
A crowd of more than 500 people clapped and cheered the royal churchgoers as
they made their way from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalen's Church.
Overhead, a light aircraft from a local flying club left vapour trails in the
sky in the shape of two giant smiling faces.
The Queen, Queen Mother, and Princess Margaret were first to arrive, in a
limousine.
The Duke of Edinburgh led the 16-strong foot party, with the Duke of York and
daughters Princesses Beatrice, seven, and Princess Eugenie, five, the latter on
her first Sandringham Christmas church outing.
The Duchess of York, who is staying at Wood Farm, on the Sandringham Estate in
Norfolk, was not present.
The Prince of Wales walked with his sons, Prince William, 13, and Prince Harry,
11, along with Prince Edward, the Princess Royal, her husband, Captain Timothy
Laurence, and children Peter Phillips, 18, and Zara Phillips, 14.
Princess Margaret's children, Lady Sarah Chatto, with her artist husband
Daniel, and Viscount Linley, with his wife Serena, made up the royal party.
Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who wore navy coats and berets, were having
Christmas lunch with the duchess at Wood Farm, while the rest of the royal
family, including their father, ate at the ``Big House''.
Speculation continues to mount over the Princess of Wales's plans this
Christmas.
She was yesterday seen leaving Kensington Palace, her London residence, and is
thought to have driven to Althorp, her family's ancestral home in
Northamptonshire.
Insiders say she had intended to spend a quiet Christmas at Kensington Palace,
having declined the Queen's invitation to be at Sandringham.
But other royal sources believe she will fly away for a holiday, possibly
skiing in Vail, Colorado, in the United States.

A CRITICALLY ill teenager suffering from pneumonia was flown from Dunbeg, near
Oban, to an intensive care unit in Glasgow yesterday.
Lorraine Watt, 16, became seriously ill on Christmas Eve and was taken to the
Lorn and Island District General Hospital soon after midnight. As her condition
deteriorated in the morning, a team from Glasgow's Western Infirmary were flown
to Oban.
With the Western's eight-bed intensive care unit full, the girl was then flown
by Royal Naval Sea King helicopter to the Southern General in Glasgow before
being transferred by ambulance to the city's Royal Infirmary.
Last night she was on a ventilator and her condition was described by a
hospital spokesman as critical. He said Lorraine had developed septic shock
which had affected her kidneys, lungs, and circulation.
Yesterday consultant Allan Henderson, who spent all night treating the teenager
at the Oban hospital, said she had been admitted in a dehydrated state, with
blood poisoning and a sore throat.
``A few days ago she had a sore throat and that got a bit worse over the
weekend. She was unable to drink and became dehydrated. When she was admitted
she had no blood pressure and was unable to pass urine. We spent the night
resuscitating her.''
He said that Lorraine had developed lung problems and it was decided to
transfer her to an intensive care unit in Glasgow. Dr Henderson added that the
girl's parents had spent most of the night at the hospital and were extremely
upset.
Lieutenant Neil Goodenough, whose five-strong team flew the teenager to
Glasgow, said the flight had been uneventful but that the girl had seemed very
poorly during the 45-minute journey. ``The shock team were there to stabilise
her and there were no complications during the flight.''
The Sea King used in the airlift was based at HMS Gannet at Prestwick and had
been on emergency standby.

<TEXT>
STRATHCLYDE Police has won two national training awards for its programmes to
reduce assaults on officers and improve the handling of child abuse cases.
It is the first time that a UK police force has won two awards in the nine-year
history of the event, which is organised under the auspices of the Department
of Education and Employment.
The officer safety training programme was set up in the wake of the death of
Constable Lewis Fulton, who was killed in June last year when he went to the
aid of a colleague who was being attacked in a Glasgow street.
It was also prompted by what police described as an ``alarming'' 3075 assaults
on officers in Strathclyde in 1994.
The programme has involved training more than 6000 officers in the use of
side-handled batons and rigid handcuffs, and practical and theoretical
instruction in safety awareness, stress awareness, and first aid.
The second award is shared by the police and three departments of Strathclyde
Regional Council - social work, education, and the reporter to the children's
panel.
Following the publication of the Clyde Report into the Orkney case, they have
jointly developed a framework designed to improve trust, communication, and
co-operation in meeting the needs of vulnerable children.

<HEADLINE>#1000m Railtrack debts to be written off before sale</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By IAIN WILSON Chief Reporter</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974700578</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
UP to #1000m of Railtrack's debts are expected to be wiped out by the
Government to appease the City in the run-up to privatisation next year.
Railtrack, in return, will have to carry out the much-need modernisation of the
West Coast main line.
However, Labour's transport spokesman Mr Brian Wilson predicted yesterday the
#1bn sweetener will go ahead and the improvements to the ageing Glasgow-London
artery will not.
Mr Wilson said: ``I fully expect this huge dowry from taxpayers will be made,
but there is no way that attached conditions could be enforced. I also remain
highly sceptical of Railtrack's commitment to the West Coast main line and in
its ability to deliver.''
He said the real reason behind the offer to write off up to half Railtrack's
debts has far more to do with the Government's privatisation process than any
desire to upgrade the Anglo-Scottish line.
``It's the same old privatisation story,'' he said. ``This time it will be
Railtrack that is feather-bedded to sweeten the City and make sure it is a `no
lose bet' when floated.''
At least #700m will be written off, according to sources close to talks between
Railtrack, the Treasury, and the Department of Transport.
That would lift Railtrack's value, currently languishing closer to #2000m than
the #4000m originally mooted by potential investors before interest waned due
to the uncertainty surrounding the sale.
It would also reduce the politically damaging spectre of Britain's railway
stations, track and other infrastructure falling into the hands of a foreign
purchaser.
It is understood the Government's offer to reduce Railtrack's debts are
conditional on carrying out improvements to the West Coast main line and
Thameslink 2000, an underground link between King's Cross and London Bridge.
Mr Wilson argued that two credibility issues surround a West Coast improvement
programme, regardless of any Government offer to subsidise Railtrack even more.
Firstly, there was Railtrack's failure to put together an upgrading package in
recent years despite numerous reports and announcements on the line's future.
Secondly, there were question marks over a privatised industry's willingness to
spend #600m-#1000m to create what would be an effective competitor against the
flagship East Coast main line.
The franchise to operate East Coast trains has opened for bids, but its
potential for a successful sale would ``clearly be influenced by prospects for
the West Coast main line''.
Scepticism has increased further with Railtrack's published programme of
#1000m-a-year infrastructure improvements over the next 10 years.
It includes a five-page appendix on proposed modernisation of the West Coast
line ranging from track renewal to 225km-an-hour tilting trains and control
systems offering automatic train protection.
However, it can be described at best as a wish list with all contents subject
to agreements on funding, including money from Europe.
Railtrack's prospectus, detailing key figures such as revenue and levels of
debt - still to be finalised - is expected by April, with privatisation due
next summer.
Officials have been in Scotland for talks with financial institutions, trying
to drum up investors for a privatisation dogged by doubts over the state of the
network and fears that Railtrack could be renationalised by a Labour government.
Prospects have further diminished in the wake of Government admissions that the
West Coast train operators' franchise will not be sold until after the next
General Election.
Railtrack's debts are estimated at between #1700m and #2000m, according to
sources who claim the Government has already offered to cut them to #1000m.
They believe Railtrack is holding out for at least #300m more to improve sale
prospects.

A MAN was last night receiving hospital treatment after being trapped for
nearly an hour in a frozen reservoir after he plunged into the water to rescue
his dog.
The 29-year-old man, who has not been named, ran on to the frozen surface of
the Threipmuir Reservoir, near Balerno, Edinburgh, after one of his three dogs
fell through a crack in the ice.
The married man from Edinburgh was trapped for an hour before a passer-by with
a mobile phone alerted emergency services.
The incident happened as the man took his dogs for an afternoon stroll on
Sunday. As he attempted his rescue, the ice under him started to break up, and
he crashed through the surface into the freezing water.
He struggled for survival in the sub-zero temperatures while the dog managed to
scramble to safety.
Police said thick patches of ice on the reservoir made it impossible for him to
swim ashore. They said that he owed his life to passers-by who spotted him as
he shouted for help.
Paramedics and fire crews went to the scene and two firemen managed to pull the
man from the water after throwing him a lifeline and dragging him across the
melting ice.
He was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where last night his condition was
said to be ``critical but improving''.
A police spokesman said yesterday: ``This shows clearly the dangers of walking
on iced-over ponds or reservoirs. No-one can ever be sure whether the ice is
going to hold their weight and the consequences of the ice breaking underneath
you can be fatal.
``A frozen pond can look very tempting, particularly for children to play on,
but we can't advise strongly enough that they should give it a wide berth.''
The rescued man's wife and family were at his bedside last night. Police said
his dog was unharmed.

THE owner of two rottweilers which savaged an 11-year-old boy told of his
horror at the attack for the first time yesterday.
Mr Kevin Turner, of Darwen, Lancashire, described the moment he came home to
find the child's blood-soaked body in his back garden.
The two dogs pounced on David Kearney after he climbed over a fence to retrieve
a football.
He was left lying semi-conscious and is now recovering in hospital. His
condition was described as ``stable but critical''.
David's family, who live nearby, have been told he will definitely be disabled
and will need extensive plastic surgery.
Mr Turner said he was devastated by the attack and described the moment he
first saw the boy lying in his garden.
A neighbour had called him on his mobile phone to say the dogs had bitten a
child, he said.
``Within 10 minutes of getting the call I got home and went straight through
into the back yard. There was a bobby shining a torch over the fence.
``I told him it was my house and he asked me to put the dogs away. I thought he
was going to tell me that the dogs had bitten a boy and that he was in hospital
having a few stitches.
``But as I turned to lock the dogs up I saw the boy lying behind the yard door.
The injuries were so bad and the poor kid was not moving at all.
``I locked the dogs up straightaway and we heard the boy make a little groan.
That told us he wasn't dead and we covered him with blankets to keep him warm.''
Mr Turner had the dogs, called Sam and Jet, destroyed on Saturday night, just
hours after the attack. He has another two rottweilers which were not involved
in the attack.
But he added: ``They are not guard dogs trained to attack people, they are pets
but they are also here to look after my house.''
Mr Turner, 42, a builder, said:``The dogs bark like mad whenever anyone comes
near the yard. It's not as if they lie in wait for people. I can't say how
sorry I am to the boy and his family.''

<HEADLINE>Pricing fears for small shops</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Government is pressing for Britain's small shopkeepers to be exempted from
Euro-rules which could make it even more difficult for them to compete with
supermarkets.
New European Commission proposals, to be discussed by Ministers in the next few
weeks, are designed to make it easier for consumers to compare prices of
household goods.
But retailers say the costs involved are too high for corner shops, which will
have to provide more detailed information about what they sell.
Consumer groups say the move will simplify life for shoppers as shopkeepers and
supermarkets will have to mark prices clearly by unit cost.
For instance, a bottle of water would include on its label the price per litre
as well as the price of the bottle.
Consumer Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino says existing rules are too
complicated to benefit customers.
A tin of tuna looks affordable at #1, she says, but less so at nearly #25 a
kilogram.
If the proposals are endorsed by governments, pricing information will have to
be displayed so that customers can make easy comparisons.
France and Sweden already insist on packaged goods being priced per unit, but
the Commission has acknowledged that adopting the idea could be costly for
small businesses.
It is proposed that the new rules should come into force two years after
agreement by Ministers, with a further four-year delay for small shopkeepers.
But the Government has seized on the issue as part of its continuing drive for
fewer directives from Brussels and is calling for total exemption for small
retailers.
The Commission says it is already being flexible - for example, Denmark will be
allowed to continue selling eggs by weight and not by number.
But Mr Roger Freeman, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who has been on a
``cut red tape'' drive for the Government, is not impressed.
``This (directive) is totally unnecessary and will add further burdens on small
business owners,'' he says.
Two other directives singled out for attacks are plans for labelling of foods
containing sweeteners and for harmonising construction standards of buses and
coaches.
The first law would mean that sweeteners would have to be labelled twice on
food packaging, once in the list of ingredients and again near the name of the
product.
The construction plan has been based around continental-style single-decker
buses and coaches and, says the Government, takes no account of double-decker
buses and minibuses.

<HEADLINE>Skye toll protesters may be charged Lawyers with a gap to bridge</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROSS Highland Correspondent</BYLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974700582</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Crown Office in Edinburgh is considering whether to launch hundreds of
prosecutions against people who have refused to pay tolls on the Skye bridge,
it emerged yesterday.
As campaigners prepared last night for a large non-payment protest on the
bridge today, a local MP demanded to know whether the bridge operators were
legally authorised to collect tolls.
The delay in announcing court proceedings has fuelled speculation that the
legal basis on which Skye Bridge Tolls Ltd has been collecting tolls might be
flawed, although the Scottish Office has repeatedly insisted that everything is
in order.
Last night the Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP, Mr Charles Kennedy, said he would
table parliamentary questions as soon as Parliament resumed.
``When this first came up some weeks ago I wrote to the Secretary of State but
I have not heard from him since,'' Mr Kennedy said. ``The Government must
answer these questions some time and I certainly will be trying to flush them
out.
``The Skye bridge is the flagship of its Private Finance Initiative, and the
Government at very least must be seen to be following the letter of its own
highly controversial law, which is bad enough without any corners being cut.''
Campaigners, meanwhile, claim there are more than 1000 cases of non-payment
pending. Many are thought to be the same people repeating their protest, but
there would appear to be several hundred different names now reported to the
procurator-fiscal in Dingwall.
The matter is being considered by the Crown Office in Edinburgh.
A spokesman could not say when a decision was expected or how many cases were
involved.
One of the first and most frequent non-payers has been Robbie (the Pict)
Robertson who has spent many months researching the legal background to the
bridge's operation. He is convinced the Scottish Office did not follow the
terms of the Act which was to empower the bridge operators to collect tolls.
``I first refused to pay on October 19 and have since written to the fiscal
explaining that the operators could not demonstrate they had the proper
authority to stop me and demand the toll,'' Mr Robertson said. ``It seems to
me, and those I have been consulting, that there are many issues in law here.
``One of the most glaring is that the Scottish Office did not advertise the
identity of the party they were licensing to collect the tolls, the warranted
concessionaire. According to the New Roads and Streetworks Act 1991 this must
be advertised in the legal paper the Edinburgh Gazette and whichever paper the
Secretary of State decides best serves the community.
``When The Herald reported this last week the Scottish Office admitted it
hadn't been advertised and claimed that this part of the Act didn't apply
because it was a new road.
``That in itself is open to challenge, but the qualification of being a new
road only exempts the Secretary of State from special parliamentary procedures.
The obligation to advertise is on the previous page, page 137, and carries no
exemption for new roads, old roads, or anything else.
He added: ``The certificate required by law has not appeared in the public
prints. It is therefore quite clear that the requirement to fulfil these
statutory procedures has not been met and therefore the authority is thus
defective.
``This is an offence in itself under Section 37 of the Act and carries the same
penalty in each case as failing to pay the toll.''

<HEADLINE>Proximity of nuclear berths to schools and houses could scuttle Devonport's Trident refit contract Safety fear over sub yard expansion</HEADLINE>

EXCLUSIVE
A POTENTIAL nuclear threat to tens of thousands of civilians in Plymouth could
finally torpedo Devonport's bid for the #5000m Trident missile submarine refit
contract and force the Government to hand the work back to Rosyth.
The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the independent body responsible for
licensing potentially hazardous atomic facilities in the UK, is to examine
plans to expand the English yard's nuclear berthing complex to within yards of
several schools and thousands of houses in the city.
Proposals to convert former battleship docks for the 16,000-ton Vanguard-class
submarines have already run into safety problems over the stability of the
limestone base on which Devonport is built.
Estimates for a strengthening operation which would meet safety criteria
currently range from #500m to #700m above the yard's winning tender, leaving
the Government facing an embarrassing political U-turn.
The NII is to ask Devonport Management Ltd, the consortium which operates the
yard, to present a safety case which must include estimates of radiation
dosages which might be received by members of the public in the event of an
accident involving a submarine's reactor.
It must also prepare another assessment of radiation release during normal
work, and cover all of the pathways by which members of the public might become
contaminated accidentally. These include water and airborne radiation.
DML, as licensee, must set up models of worst-case scenarios for an emission of
radioactive material and be able to predict both dose rates and frequencies of
public exposure. These findings will then be compared against the
inspectorate's own safety assessment principles before a licence is issued.
A spokesman for the NII explained: ``An important parameter in the models for
some accidents will be the distance of a member of the public from the source
of a radioactive release. The doses calculated will depend on this distance,
and therefore NII's view of the safety of the plant will depend on the
proximity of the public to it.''
Dr Stephen Huggett, a leading member of Plymouth's anti-nuclear Dump
Information Group and a reader in mathematical physics, said last night: ``The
proposed five-fold nuclear site expansion, including the Trident refit docks at
Devonport, will bring it right up to the dockyard perimeter wall on the main
Saltash Road.
``This is surrounded by thousands of houses and several schools. This would
make the submarine refit complex the closest in proximity to the public of any
nuclear site in Britain. Should an accident occur, tens of thousands of people
could be exposed to immediate and intense radioactivity.
``I am convinced that NII has genuinely grave concerns over the safety
implications to the public. If their determination is based, as they say, on
public proximity to sources of radiation and doses likely to be absorbed in an
accident, then there is no way that the site at Devonport should ever be
granted a licence.''
The NII is also understood to have asked DML for assurances on a fall-back
electrical supply to the Vanguard refitting-refuelling berths. A
Chernobyl-level nuclear disaster was recently averted at the last minute when
authorities cut off electricity to the Russian naval port of Murmansk because
of unpaid bills.
Total electrical failure during refuelling of a submarine reactor could lead to
meltdown and an explosion which would release radioactive gas and particles
into the atmosphere.
The NII is demanding ``a thorough analysis'' of the electrical supply to
Devonport and the provision of alternative sources such as diesel generators.
It will be up to DML to prove that it can handle the consequences of accidental
or deliberate severing of supply and meet safety parameters laid down by the
UK's Health and Safety Executive.

SECOND World War veterans in France have launched a fund-raising appeal to pay
for a statue of Field Marshal Montgomery.
The Normandy Veterans Association has commissioned a #15,000 statue to be
erected in the village of Colleville-Montgomery, near the site where the field
marshal landed during the D-Day invasion 52 years ago.
Ingliston refit
A REDEVELOPMENT scheme costing #5.4m is to go ahead at the Ingliston showground
in Edinburgh. The grounds are home to the Royal Highland Show which rates as
one of Europe's main farming trade exhibitions. This year's show drew 153,000
visitors in four days and farmers spent more than #80m on machinery.
Youth charged
A TEENAGER is due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court tomorrow in connection
with an alleged murder attempt on a 15-year-old boy. The youth, 16, was
arrested following an alleged stabbing incident in Union Park, Carrick Knowe
Parkway, Edinburgh, last week.
Open secrets
THE Bank of England is considering making public secret regional reports about
the economy. The reports, based on visits to companies and other business
contacts, help the Bank form its judgment of how the economy is performing and
the prospects for inflation.
Housing advice
ALMOST 50,000 families have had their homes repossessed in the past 12 months,
Shelter reported yesterday. The charity urges home-owners to seek advice, never
to hand in their house keys, and to call their lenders as soon as they are
having difficulties. Ministers are urged to introduce a mortgage benefit
scheme. This would be available to home-owners on low incomes as well as
unemployed homeowners, replacing current income support payments.
Bar shooting
DETECTIVES are continuing their investigations into the fatal shooting of a man
in a crowded city centre bar. Francis George Kelly, 28, died after being shot
in the chest in Macey's Bar, Newcastle upon Tyne. A friend, David Armstrong,
23, was shot in the arm as he went to Mr Kelly's aid. The gunman fled the scene.
Play project
A PROJECT to build a #38,500 children's play area in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh,
will use the labour of 16 unemployed people. The initiative is being funded by
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd as part of its Training in the Environment
programme.

AN injured motor cyclist and a motorist who went to his aid were killed when
they were struck twice by two cars.
Mr David Logan, 65, of Forfar, went to comfort motor cyclist Mr Brian Ogilvie,
32, of Laurencekirk, who had collided with the rear of his broken-down car.
But as Mr Logan's wife looked on, two cars collided with the men at speed
leaving both with fatal injuries.
The accident on the A90 Dundee to Perth road brought the death toll on the
carriageway to 17 this year.
Both men are understood to have died instantly in the accident which occurred
at 2.15pm on Christmas Eve on the southbound carriageway at the Happas junction
about eight miles north of Dundee.
Local councillors and MPs have been calling for the road to be upgraded and
work has now begun on improvements to some stretches.
q Eighteen-year-old Kim Irvine, from Preston Court, Linlithgow, died in
hospital yesterday after receiving multiple injuries when a car in which she
was travelling was in collision with another car on the Linlithgow to
Winchburgh road at the Bridgend junction in West Lothian on Saturday.
q A Grampian teenager was killed in a road accident on Christmas Eve. Mr Barry
Skene, 18, was walking towards his home in Inverurie after spending the evening
in the nearby village of Blackburn. A few miles north of the village, on the
A96, he was struck by a car driven by a woman.
The driver was uninjured in the accident. Mr Skene, an apprentice joiner, was a
single man who lived with his parents at Crichie Circle, Port Elphinstone,
Inverurie.
q A police inspector and his two sons died when their car was involved in a
pile-up. Inspector David Hogarth, 41, and his 12-year-old son Matthew died
instantly when their car was in a collision involving three lorries and another
car in icy conditions on the A515 in the Derbyshire Peak District on Saturday.

A SURGICAL ward has been closed to new admissions after an outbreak of a rare
viral infection.
Three patients in ward seven at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary have been affected by
the MRSA bacteria. Another man is being tested for the virus.
A hospital official said last night that they were treating the outbreak
seriously. She said all admissions to the ward had been stopped until further
notice.
The bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, is highly infectious
and outbreaks have occurred in hospitals before.
The hospital official said it was difficult to pinpoint symptoms for the
disease apart from the general feeling of being run-down and ill.
She added: ``This is something we are treating very seriously and are dealing
with. Outbreaks occur in hospitals from time to time and we have a well-tried
and tested control of infection systems.''

<HEADLINE>Scotland's Christmas Day of 115mph winds, 30ft snow drifts, blocked roads, and towns cut off Powerless in the blizzard</HEADLINE>

SNOW storms and some of the most severe blizzards in 40 years have brought
power cuts and misery for thousands in the Highlands and Islands.
The Northern and Western Isles were hardest hit, with winds of up to 115mph,
30ft snowdrifts, and sub-zero temperatures overnight. The harsh weather is
expected to continue in some areas today.
Shetland suffered its worst weather in living memory, and the coastguard rescue
helicopter had to take five seriously ill people to hospital in Lerwick as
blizzards continued to sweep over the islands.
A motorist died at the wheel after suffering an apparent heart attack in the
white-out conditions. The man, aged 60, was travelling towards Aberdeen on the
A90 south of Stonehaven, Kincardineshire. The alarm was raised by the driver of
the car behind who used his mobile phone to call the police.
He had become concerned when the man's car stopped and caused a build-up of
traffic on the northbound carriageway.
An ambulance, escorted by a police car and three snowploughs, reached the
driver through heavy snow but he died on the way to hospital. His identity is
being withheld until relatives have been told.
Roads were blocked across the country and Hydro-Electric confirmed that 23,600
homes around northern Scotland were without power yesterday. A total of 300
engineers, some using helicopters, worked to restore supplies, but householders
could be without power for a total of five days.
Transport was almost non-existent. One police spokesman summed it up:
``Basically Grampian is closed.''
Every road in his region was affected by snow with only the A90 from Aberdeen
passable with care for drivers travelling south to Stonehaven and north to
Peterhead.
Some towns in the north were cut off.
A Hydro-Electric spokesman said: ``We are doing everything we can to restore
electricity to the homes but the engineers were really up against it at the
height of the storm. In some cases we were finding that as soon as we had
restored power the wires were being blown down again, leaving us no option but
to start from square one.
``The gale force conditions made it virtually impossible to make any headway,
but once the winds die down a bit we will be able to make better progress.''
He expected everybody to have their power back on by tomorrow.
Shetland, normally free of snow, saw it lying up to 13in deep. Many families
were left without electricity for heating Christmas dinners two days after
power cables were brought down by snow.
All roads on the island were closed and helicopters were being used instead of
ambulances.
In one incident, villagers in Tresta lit fires outside the house of a
six-month-old child with breathing difficulties to guide in the helicopter. The
other incidents included a woman being flown to hospital in Lerwick after she
suffered a suspected heart attack, and an elderly woman taken from the village
of Virkie to the Gilbert Bain Hospital.
Television programmes were blacked out, apart from Sky TV, because of damage to
a transmitter.
Lerwick, and its 8000 population, were cut off by drifts more than 30ft high.
More than 1000 homes were without power.
Shetland resident Hugh Harrop, 26, said: ``Conditions are horrendous, the worst
here for years.''
Shetland Islands Council told snowplough drivers to stay at home for their own
safety. Council convener Lewis Smith said: ``The snowploughs can't cope. Heavy
snow in Shetland is highly unusual and the only snow-blowers are at the main
airport.
``Crews who were out yesterday are totally exhausted.''
A young mother with a three-day-old baby flew home to Shetland from an Aberdeen
hospital on Christmas Eve to find she was stranded by snow at Sumburgh Airport.
Mrs Laureen Hay and her family had to check into a hotel along with 28 other
stranded air travellers.
Three ferry sailings were cancelled and the air ambulance was called out to the
township of Otterswick in the off-lying island of Yell because all roads were
blocked by drifting snow. More heavy snow has been forecast for Shetland.
Parts of the Western Isles were also without power, affecting up to 4000
customers. Electricity engineers were airlifted to problem areas including
Ness, Gress, Back, Tolsta, Callanish, Breasclete, and Uig. Roads were blocked
by a foot of snow, trapping drivers in their cars.
In one accident, a driver and his daughter refused to be rescued by police
until officers also saved their wild goat. Mr Jimmy Macdonald and daughter Anne
Louise crashed into a ditch near South Shawbost on Lewis during the blizzard
after buying the goat. All three were eventually helped from the van. In
Grampian, the police spokesman described the road conditions as horrendous.
``We are asking people not to take their cars out, but if they feel they have
to visit relatives at this time of year we are advising them to take the proper
precautions.
Snowploughs kept the main A9 Perth to Inverness and Inverness to Wick roads
open, but conditions were ``difficult'' with high winds creating white-out
conditions with heavy drifting during the frequent heavy snow showers.
The Speyside town of Grantown-on-Spey was completely cut off by road with all
routes out of town blocked by the snow. The A96 Aberdeen to Inverness road was
blocked in three places south of Elgin. The main Moray coastal route, the A98,
was also blocked between Fraserburgh and Banff.
One route to Glenshee ski slopes, the A93 north of Blairgowrie, was also
blocked in several places, as were many roads around Scotland's highest
village, Tomintoul, Grampian.
Many other main and minor roads in the Highlands were blocked by snowdrifts. AA
Roadwatch said most main roads in Scotland were passable with care but warned
drivers not to travel unless absolutely necessary. Avalanche warnings have been
issued for the northern Cairngorms.
The weekend saw fatal accidents on the A96 Aberdeen to Inverness road, the
Dundee to Perth road and near Bridgend, West Lothian.
Glasgow saw heavy snow falls on Christmas Eve but most of south and central
Scotland was dry, clear, and cold yesterday. The last white Christmas in
Glasgow, in the sense of snow falling, was 1980.
Edinburgh escaped the worst of the weather but there were warnings of heavy
snowfalls in the Borders and possibly Fife. A widespread frost was expected
last night. Heavy snow last fell in Edinburgh on Christmas Day in 1962.
Snow also affected parts of Durham, north Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Wales,
and East Anglia.
There were mixed benefits for skiers. At Nevis Range on Aonach Mor, by Ben
Nevis, the snow that fell was the kind every skier dreams of - cold powder. It
fell, however, on the bare and frozen hill where little or no base of hard snow
is established. The conditions were calm, allowing the snow to accumulate.
Nevis Range said it hoped to have sufficient consolidated snow to give limited
ski areas for beginners and lower intermediates today.
On Cairngorm around 300 people turned up for a Christmas Day ski on some of the
lower slopes, where the chairlift company had managed to use piste machines to
build a base.
At Glencoe there was insufficient snow for skiing at White Corries on Meall a'
Bhuirdh, but the main runs were ``filling in nicely''. The Lecht in Grampian
has already had some skiing but has also suffered high winds.
q Today's football programme has been hit by the weather. The matches between
Falkirk and Aberdeen; Clydebank and Dundee; and Brechin and Alloa were called
off last night. Pitch inspections were announced for Hearts v Motherwell and
Raith Rovers v Celtic.

Man accused of
three murders
A BUSINESSMAN has been accused of a third murder and will appear before
magistrates tomorrow. Mr Peter Moore, 49, of Kinmel Bay, Clwyd, who runs a
string of rural cinemas, was charged on Sunday night with killing an
unidentified man whose body was recovered from Clocaenog Forest, near Ruthin,
following a tip-off on Saturday.
He had earlier been charged with murdering Mr Keith Randles, of Chester, who
was found stabbed at a construction site in Anglesey last month. On Friday
night he was charged with murdering father-of-two Tony Davies, 40, who was
found stabbed on a beach at Pensarn, Abergele, last Monday.
Man questioned
DETECTIVES in Berwick are questioning a 44-year-old man following an incident
at Chatton near Wooler in which a bottle containing inflammable liquid was
thrown through a house window. An off-duty policeman was a witness to the
incident which caused minor damage.
Gifts stolen
POLICE appealed for help to replace stolen Christmas presents after a family of
seven children awoke to find theirs had vanished from under the tree. Officers
said burglars broke into the house in Auckland Road, Sparkbrook, Birmingham,
while the family slept.
End of goodwill
DIVORCE is on the cards after Mary Christmas and husband Geoff have parted
after 25 years of marriage. Mrs Christmas, 54, who ran the Robin Hood Hotel in
Hall Green, Birmingham, with her husband and has a 13-year-old daughter, said:
``I won't be remarrying after the divorce and I won't be changing my surname -
I like it and have had it for 25 years so why should I?''
1986 prices
ICELAND, the frozen foods firm, will this week fire an early shot in the new
year supermarket price war. The High Street chain is turning the clock back a
decade by cutting prices to 1986 levels on hundreds of items. The company says
the offer will last for two weeks from December 30.
Jackson No.1
SUPERSTAR Michael Jackson has taken the No.1 spot in the Christmas singles
chart beating novelty band Mike Flowers Pops after days of speculation. The
single Earth Song from Jackson's comeback album HIStory, which hit the top spot
last week, managed to hang on despite unexpectedly high sales for Flowers's
tongue-in-cheek version of the Oasis hit Wonderwall in its first week of
release.
Pointing the way
GOVERNMENT changes to tourist signposting regulations are to be discussed at a
one-day conference being held by the Scottish Tourist Board in Stirling on
January 30. It will deal with implementation of the planned changes and how to
maximise the potential benefit that improved signposting can bring throughout
Scotland.
Three orphaned
THREE young children were being cared for by relatives yesterday after a family
row ended in the violent deaths of their parents. The tragedy was discovered on
Saturday when police were called to the family home at Cleator, near Egremont,
West Cumbria, and found Leslie Brough, 35, dead from gunshot wounds. His wife
Andrea, 29, had serious head injuries and died later in hospital. Police said
no other persons were being sought.

AS the 200th anniversary of the death of Robert Burns approaches, many like
myself are preparing readings of the Bard's work. My own previous experience
has been limited to Addressing the Haggis and I was strongly criticised for
what the critic considered to be the wrong pronunciation of ``dight'',
``sleight,'' and ``bright''.
My response at the time was to inform the critics (others joined in) that it
would be far more natural for me as a Brechiner to use the ``icht'' version but
that Burns whose father was a native of nearby eastern parts and may well have
dichted his nose, would have written ``dicht'', etc, if that is what he
preferred.
Fairly extensive investigation of his writings has failed to show any use of
this vernacular - ``nocht,'' yes, but not ``nicht''. Somehow A Cotter's
Saturday Nicht does not ring true.
Over the years I have heard many fine renderings of various Burns works, some
with one pronunciation, some with the other, each without detraction of sense
or quality.
However, I would be interested to have your opinion, or that of your resident
Burns aficionados, as well as responses from Burns scholars who may care to
advise me on this matter.

<HEADLINE>Scotland ace makes fresh start with superclub Armstrong signs on at Newcastle</HEADLINE>

GARY Armstrong has signed for Newcastle and expects to make his debut for Sir
John Hall's superclub early in the new year.
Armstrong put pen to paper at the weekend and will report to Kingston Park on
January 2 for training and a medical examination.
Both Armstrong and Newcastle's director of rugby development Rob Andrew expect
that the medical will be a formality and he should make his league debut for
his new club on January 6 against Wakefield.
Armstrong, who won the last of his 30 Scotland caps against Ireland nearly two
years ago, has fought back to fitness after a devastating knee injury kept him
out of the game for a year and, at one stage, threatened to end his career.
Twice voted Herald Player of the Year, Armstrong said yesterday: ``The
negotiations have taken longer than I would have liked but this is a big step
for me and we had to get the details right.
``The contract was with my lawyer for a fortnight and then it was sent down to
Newcastle for them to have a look at it. Only after both sets of lawyers had
given it the go-ahead was it possible for me to sign.
``Rob phoned me at the weekend and said that everything was fine, so I have
signed. He told me to take a break and come down after the new year.
He added: ``It's a great relief to have signed and it means that I can make a
fresh start in the new year.''
Armstrong will continue to live in Jedburgh for the duration of the three-year
contract, which is worth in excess of #150,000.
The move from Riverside to Kingston Park will mean Armstrong rekindling the
half-back partnership which he struck up with Andrew during the 1989 British
Lions tour to New Zealand.
On that tour, Armstrong played second-fiddle to Robert Jones, of Wales, and
Andrew, a latecomer to the tour after injury to Paul Dean, leap-frogged Craig
Chalmers to become first-choice fly-half.
Nevertheless, Armstrong and Andrew got on well and it is a relationship which
has paid dividends in light of Andrew's #750,000 move from Wasps to become
Hall's recruiting officer at Kingston Park.
Armstrong, who is intent on winning back his Scotland place, said that he had
not been surprised by his omission from the `A' side to play Italy on Saturday
week.
The selectors have gone for a virtual front-line selection and Bryan Redpath is
first-choice scrum half with Derrick Patterson on the replacements' bench.
``I'm disappointed, obviously, not to be in the side, especially after having
captained the `A' side against Western Samoa, but I know that I'm not yet on
top of my game.
``Jim Telfer is right when he says that I've not yet recaptured the form that I
had before the knee injury. I know that I'm not on top of my game and if they
had picked me they would have done so on past reputation, not on current form.
``That would not have been good enough for me or the team. I intend to get back
into the international reckoning but I need more games under my belt in order
to do that. I reckon that I've just played eight games after being out for more
than a year,'' he said.
Doddie Weir, who has also been involved in negotiations with Newcastle, said at
the weekend that he expected to make an announcement about his future next week.
The Melrose and Scotland lock said: ``Gary is a wee bit further on than me. The
lawyers are still looking at the contract and, all being well, it will be next
week at least before I put pen to paper.''
Scotland captain Rob Wainwright has confirmed that he will play for Watsonians
in the new year. Wainwright, an army doctor, has been playing with the West
Hartlepool club while based at Catterick.
He has now moved back to Edinburgh and has started work at a general practice
with army links in the Oxgangs area.
Before he moved south, the Scotland back-row player had been with Edinburgh
Academicals. The Raeburn Place side, who have been relegated to Division II,
had been hoping he would re-enlist with them.
Wainwright said: ``It was always going to be a difficult choice between
Watsonians and Accies but I've decided to go with Watsonians, first, because
Myreside is convenient for me and, second, because Accies are now in the second
division.
``I'm sure they will come back quickly but I think I should be playing
first-division rugby next season.''
Wainwright has still to complete his commitments with West Hartlepool but will
make his debut for Watsonians early in the new year and should be available for
the Myreside outfit full-time as the cup competition gets under way in earnest.

THE Scottish Trades Union Congress today calls on Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth to set up a Scottish investment bank.
In a briefing paper, the STUC said governments had a central role to play in
encouraging enterprise, and an initiative to establish a Scottish investment
bank would help tackle the failure of the market to provide long-term,
high-risk lending in Scotland.
Scotland needed an enduring finance/industry relationship to help plug its
investment gap. This would not be achieved solely by setting up a Scottish
investment bank but, even in its minimal form, it would be a clear signal of
the Scottish Secretary's commitment to improving the way Scotland worked.
Even the step of bringing existing Government and European backed loan grant
and equity schemes together under a unified structure would offer real benefits
to the Scottish economy.
An even bigger impact would be made if a fully fledged industrial development
and reconstruction bank were to be launched, with funding from new oil revenues.
The functions of a Scottish Investment Bank, the STUC said, should be to
provide grants, loans, and equity to fill funding gaps; assist in unlocking
funds from private providers of capital; and tailor UK and European Union
programmes to fit Scottish needs and economic conditions.
Under the proposals, the bank's financial services would be marketed and
operated through a revamped Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise network.
Policy guidelines for the bank would be set by a management board comprising
the Scottish Office, the Enterprise network, Scottish local authorities,
unions, and employers from both the financial community and wider industry.
Mr Richard Leonard, STUC assistant secretary, said that an acute shortage of
suitable finance for industrial investment prevented Scotland from achieving
its full economic development potential and was hampering job growth.
``This is an area where a Government lead is badly needed to overcome market
failure and to stimulate new investment from existing financial institutions.''
Mr Leonard said that an investment bank was currently being put together in
embryonic form by Scottish Enterprise, with its new #25m Equity Partnership
scheme.
``But,'' he said, ``this represents only a beginning and does not address the
gap in funding for small firms, nor does it tackle the confusion which is
created by a multiplicity of funders and public agencies.''
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said that Mr Forsyth would give the STUC's
proposal full consideration.

QUANTITY surveyor Frank Thomas does not believe the recession has ended, and
suggests that it never will.
A senior partner in Thomas &amp; Adamson, Thomas states his view on the recession
in stark terms.
``I would say it hasn't ended. The difficulties we are all experiencing are not
going to disappear, and have become a way of life.''
This view should perhaps be put in the context that throughout the recession
Thomas &amp; Adamson, quantity surveyors, has continued to expand.
In 1985, the firm employed 30 people, and by 1989 had grown to 40, but by 1995
this had jumped to 65 staff in the firm's offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In 1989, the firm was still engaged in purely quantity surveying work, but in
1992 it diversified into building services, then in 1994 added project
management to its roles, and this year, with the advent of the new health and
safety legislation, began supplying planning supervisors.
Thomas &amp; Adamson was founded 60 years ago by Thomas's father Eric. Frank joined
the partnership in 1965, when 15 were employed in the firm, after training
elsewhere.
He took over the reins in 1973 when his father retired, and in 1977 Thomas &amp;
Adamson opened its Glasgow office. ``We now try to provide a one-stop service
for our customers,'' he said, ``and were one of the first firms to go down this
road.''
One of the firm's first project management contracts was the #12m development
of Inverness Airport which is still ongoing, and Thomas &amp; Adamson will be
involved in the development of the Royal Mail's #7m Scottish Distribution
Centre at Excelsior Park in Wishaw.
``Work begins on this project early in 1996, and we have also been appointed
quantity surveyors for the Dean Centre in Edinburgh which is to be converted
into the new Eduardo Paolozzi Gallery,'' said Mr Thomas.
It is unlikely that Thomas &amp; Adamson will open any further branch offices in
Scotland, as Frank believes that they can adequately cover Scotland from
Edinburgh and Glasgow but this does not rule out branch offices being open
elsewhere.

WITH only a little help from Mystic Meg, the Diary has been fortunate in
securing a copy of the Queen's speech for the year 2000, as delivered by Her
Majesty from the balcony of the royal palace in George Square, Glasgow, during
the Hogmanay celebrations. The full text is as follows:
Much has been achieved in the four years since England, Wales, and Northern
Ireland gained their independence from Scotland. Under the guidance of Prime
Minister Sir Pat Lally, the Scottish government have pushed through a programme
of reforms which has transformed the country. Sir George Galloway, Leader of
the Opposition, is also to be congratulated for the constructive way in which
his Labour Party have conducted themselves in the Scottish parliament in its
new home at the Caird Hall, Dundee.
We now stand second only to Germany in the European Union league table of
economic performance.
Exports of whisky, water, and BSE-free beef continue to soar. Oil revenue is at
an all-time high with the new finds in the Firth of Clyde. One of my
engagements in the coming year will be to declare open the new headquarters of
ScotOil, the state oil company, in Rothesay.
The healthy state of the Scottish balance of payments has allowed my government
to reach their tax targets of 20% for income tax, 5% for VAT, and zero duty on
whisky.
The land reform five-year plan, which prohibits any citizen from owning an
estate of more than 100 acres, has been carried out with relatively little
bloodshed. The Duke of Atholl's ill-advised attempt to use his private Army to
deny access to the new lawful owners ended when he was shot in the back by one
of his own men. My government has offered an amnesty to the Duke of Argyll who
is thought still to be hiding somewhere in Knoydart.
The main problem facing the Scottish government continues to be the flood of
illegal immigrants from England. We have increased our annual quota to 100,000
but this in no way meets the demand for Scottish citizenship by economic
immigrants from south of the Border.
Sir Pat will shortly be holding urgent talks on this matter with Mr Gordon
Brown, the English Prime Minister.
Scotland's standing with the nations of the world has never been higher, as is
confirmed by reports from such Scottish ambassadors as the Duke of Edinburgh
(or Sean Connery as people still insist on calling him) at the Washington
embassy and Sir Michael Forsyth in Ulan Bator.
The five terrestrial and 40 satellite channels of the Scottish Broadcasting
Corporation have been a remarkable success in their first full year of
operation. I am sorry to report, by the way, that the SBC director-general Sir
Rikki Fulton has intimated his intention to retire at the end of the year.
The Scottish Broadcasting Corporation will pursue its case in the European
Court of Justice against Rupert Murdoch's Sky-BBC company for return of a share
of the assets of the former British Broadcasting Corporation.
On the sports front, Scotland continues to thrive. The Scottish football team
will this year defend our European Championship title while at club level Raith
Rovers continue to dominate Europe. Work is now complete on the new stadia for
Fitba'2002 and team manager Sir Jack Charlton is to be congratulated for the
quality of his squad which qualified automatically as both holder and host
nation for the World Cup.
The two million members of the Scottish People's Football Association voted
unanimously to persist with legal moves in Paraguay for the extradition of
former chief executive James Farry.
I was proud to see my son Prince Peter lead the Scottish team to a gallant
defeat against New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup in Wales.
On a further personal note, my family and I have settled in most comfortably to
our accommodation at the royal palace, or City Chambers, as most people still
insist on calling it. Sir Pat Lally has been such a help choosing the pictures.
The former caretaker's flat is a little on the small side but it is very handy
for Marks and Spencer and granny, or the Queen Mum as people still insist on
calling her, does enjoy popping over to Chamber's Bar for the special
pensioner's lunch.
The space problem should be solved when Princess Senga (she never liked the
name Zara) moves into a flat in the West End to be handy for her job as a
waitress in the Ubiquitous Chip. My husband, King Tim the First as our Parkhead
subjects like to call him, is usually away in Rosyth with his work as the
admiral of the Scottish Navy.
My brother Charles, Duke of Windsor, has found contentment at his croft on
Benbecula. It has been a busy year for me in my full-time job running the House
of Stewart Leisure Corporation. Occupancy rates at the Holyrood Palace Hotel
topped 90% for the first time last year. Victoria World, the theme park at
Balmoral, also turned in a satisfactory performance. My sister-in-law, Queen
Fergie the First of England, has been in touch to tap our expertise for similar
projects at Sandringham and Windsor.
My family and I are proud to have been selected as Scotland's constitutional
monarchs and have definitely decided to re-apply when the franchise comes up
for renewal in the year 2005.
May I conclude by wishing you comrades orrabest for the New Year.
Anne, Queen of Scots

WELL, by now the pretty blunders are exposed. Not since those early portraits
revealed the stout determination of Queen Victoria's young bosom has any royal
cleavage nudged itself so insistently into the global psyche. Princess Diana's
New York decollete, bracketed by Henry Kissinger's leer and Colin Powell's
inquisitive frown, has brought a new dimension to wannabe culture, turning
Christmas into an all-out wonder-bust.
But when the giftwrap comes off the lingerie, the agitation starts. As many
women will now know to their discomfort, men in this country have no sense of
accuracy when selecting presents of intimate apparel. Indeed such is their
mammary obsession that when they embark on underwear purchases they invariably
overdo the bra measurements.
Not so the French who are far more knowing in these matters. When they buy a
bra for a woman it fits with impeccable precision. But, according to the trade,
Glasgow males particularly err on the side of the heroic breast: 52% of those
once interviewed by Sock Shop believed their wives to be more extravagantly
busted than actual measurements revealed. At the same time, 31% of husbands
thought their spouses two inches smaller around the waist, and a quarter of men
insisted their wives' hips were one inch smaller than reality. If this wishful
vision were true the average woman in this city would be a voluptuous 40-24-38.
French underwear companies have also been analysing selling trends recently,
and report that in volume over the festive season lingerie now equals the
buying of chocolates and flowers. But even in the cause of European unity these
experienced manufacturers have not managed to educate our men in the correct
purchasing approach.
Scots will keep choosing something sexy in black when - according to the
counter monitors - most women desire something more substantial in white. It
makes for a dismal picture, really: men excitedly watching their wives open
Christmas boxes filled with seductive black Chantilly, and women feigning
smiles at the sight of all that roomy froth while pining for a bit of cotton
buttressing which won't fall apart in the wash.
Comfort and efficiency are the female priorities in bra purchasing. As women
harness themselves up for the day, eroticism is the last thing on their minds,
which may or may not say much about their husbands. Even so our continental
sisters do seem different. In Italy and Spain as well as France every fifth
shop in even the smallest of towns seems dedicated to the bosom as a silky
source of pride and sexual identity.
But the continentals have not always had bras their own way. During the
fifties, with Jane Russell's bust in the ascendant, Americans listed towards
chest measurements of such an acute angle that many women felt inadequate. Then
some lout in the film studios ungallantly revealed that Russell's decolletage
was man-made, so to speak; the consequence of engineering technology devised by
the then movie mogul and inventor, Howard Hughes.
His special cantilevered brassiere provided the star with the kind of peaks and
troughs that sent the nation's womanhood rushing for padding. As a consquence
it also drove authors like Philip Roth and film makers like Woody Allen into
that agonising artistic genre called the engulfing superbreast.
Today, old trusty companies, like Gossard, have once again offered a new
generation the kind of uplift required by fashion's encore for the operatic
bosom. But throughout the centuries breasts of every shape and size have been
subjected to structural change.
In the past few years alone they have been squeezed into the tight bustiers
which resulted from Saint Laurent's fascination with Carmen. They have roamed
free beneath the veils of John Galliano, and been pressed downwards into
obscurity by the disciplined Japanese. Gaultier has pointed them straight
ahead, like inverted traffic cones, and Lagerfeld and Lacroix have pushed them
outwards, offering them up, like a pair of pulsating marshmallows on a plate.
During most of this the brassiere has formed a close attachment to womankind,
yet chosen by the wrong hands it becomes a saboteur, out to wreck the female
image. Few things are considered ill-mannered these days, but the sight of a
woman delving inside her blouse to give an errant bra-strap a yank remains
utterly declasse. For the sake of aesthetics alone men might have done us all a
favour, this Christmas, and got those damned statistics right.

NOT everyone will be glued to the telly this mad and allegedly merry season.
Some of us will have our noses in a book. Even in an era when worship of the
box is all but universal, old Johann Gutenberg's gift of print is still a
treasured possession. However alluring images on screen may be, bookworms know
there is nothing more satisfying than those pictures in the mind conjured up by
the printed word. And though the imminent death of the written word is forecast
at regular intervals, the condemned medium doggedly declines to lie down. Delia
Smith may not be the literary giant of the nineties but her Winter Collection
of recipes is likely to come out on top as the million-copy seller of the year.
In the mind-over-belly league, Salman Rushdie's latest novel The Moor's Last
Sigh is selling like hot cakes.
Does this mean that all is well in the book world? At first glance it may seem
so. The past weeks have been something of a bonanza for the book-buying and
book-reading public (not always the same thing). According to figures produced
by the organisation Bookwatch, the past year's book sales in Britain are likely
to prove higher than in 1994 - albeit by only a slim margin, and not as great
in total as the year before that. There are special circumstances, however.
Above all, the disappearance of the book price agreement has distorted the
figures. The same phenomenon may lead in the new year to higher prices on books
in general to compensate for lost revenue on cut-price best sellers. Not
surprisingly there was a rush to buy books heavily discounted in the immediate
aftermath of that event, though the scamper has already tailed off considerably
and may not have a significant long-term effect on total sales. Sales of
hardback fiction, most affected by price-cutting, have grown
disproportionately, probably at the expense of other classes. Another rogue
element has been the huge success of the Penguin 60s, the series of
small-format paperbacks, brief in content, usually excerpted from longer works,
which was introduced to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the house. Is this a
sign of the times? Will such book-bites - so handy for travellers,
holidaymakers, and all readers with shortish attention spans - become part of
the regular stock in the shops, to the benefit of readers, writers, and the
book trade alike? At least it shows there is still resilience in the publishing
world. Pace the pessimists, the future is an open book.

I CAN'T look at another bit of turkey. If anyone gives me more red wine I'll
fall over. It could be that I am now allergic to stuffing. If someone seriously
suggests that we should be playing rugby in all this muck and snow at this time
of year then I'll giggle into my mince pie and happily top myself. What utter
madness it is trying to proceed with sport at this time.
There I was on Christmas Eve, a time of gathering with family and friends,
sitting on the pew in front of the wife of a rather well-known Glasgow
committee man.
``Where's the boy himself then?'' I asked politely, halfway through Hark The
Herald Angels Sing. I like tunes that have your employer's name in them.
``He's away through to Murrayfield to watch the Glasgow game,'' she said,
obviously a great deal less than delighted at this fate. ``But it could have
been worse, he was supposed to go to Selkirk until the game was transferred.''
Listen, there is no way on earth that we should make the players play these
games at this time of year and under the present circumstances.
I watched the Accies versus West game on Saturday, and although I saw it
described somewhere as an exciting and flowing contest let me tell you it was
distinctly second-class with some lads on view who shouldn't ever have been
playing first XV rugby.
I felt sorry for the boys having to strut their stuff when rugby was probably
the last thing on their minds.
I know the season is congested and the games have to be played or else we
finish the leagues in July, but this year has left me in no doubt whatsoever
that there should be a mid-season break to be capitalised upon by the
international squad and no-one else.
Let Kenny Logan and company go through to Murrayfield and train to beat the
English, but the rest of rugby's brethren should be relaxing in the warmth of
their family glow. Not risking broken legs on Christmas Eve, for goodness sake.
Long ago, I played in these games at this time of the year, and if we want lads
to take the field after some beers the night before and far too much food then,
by all means, let's proceed.
If we want blokes to play games when only half motivated and one eye on the
referee, longing for the final whistle then let's get ahead. And if we want to
annoy womankind at one fell swoop then by all means play rugby over Christmas
and new year.
You know, I passed some poor man lying on the road with a broken leg on
Christmas Eve. He had slipped and fallen and the thing was terribly twisted and
sore and he was waiting for the ambulance.
With that in mind I put this question to the men here: Let's say you were a
woman, or a child, and the man of the house comes home with a broken leg on
Christmas Eve after playing rugby, what would you do?
I know, you'd say how unfortunate it was that this had happened, you didn't
mind that the festive period was now all screwed up, and, anyway, what time is
visiting time at the Western, darling?
Aye, sure thing. Bollocks! You'd be mad. Hopping mad. It's a funny thing about
sport in some ways isn't it? Over this time of year we'll have all these
plonkers from the various football clubs, and rugby districts, dressed up in
their clan blazers as the teams play each other in traditional rivalry.
Do you know what I figure? I figure it suits everyone except the players, the
players' families, the committee men's families, and the supporters' families.
These events are designed entirely for . . . well, I don't actually know who
they're designed for at all. I think the players hate playing games around
Christmas and new year, tradition or no tradition. It takes self-denial on to a
new plane.
If it's rugby we are talking about then the players know that they have to play
to have any chance of making the big team, but, for the rest, it's possibly a
day's pay they could live without.
Another thing. Why do we insult Italy the way we do and not just accept that
this `A' team outing is a full cap game?
The side is loaded with big-name players, current caps in other words, and the
team looks to me like a Test side. A far inferior team were given caps when
they played against Argentina a year ago. We should be granting teams like
Italy the honour of knowing that we regard them highly by awarding our players
caps for this one.
In fact, I'd like to see the Five Nations expanded now to bring in Italy and
Romania. Call it the Seven Nations, just to be novel. Now, Romania? We awarded
full caps against them on Gavin's last game, didn't we?

FOOD sales are traditionally strong in the run-up to Christmas. In addition to
the usual commodity purchases, Christmas brings out a taste for more luxurious
items such as peaches in brandy, luxury chocolates and biscuits, specialist
mustards and more recently the ready-made party food which Marks &amp; Spencer, in
particular, excels.
Given the sluggish state of consumer spending for much of the year and the
intense competition in the market place, food retailers will be pinning their
hopes on a bumper December. Of the leading groups J Sainsbury, Britain's
biggest food retailer, will probably be paying closer attention to its sales
line than usual given its underperformance in recent months.
Sainsbury's interim results were disappointing, showing as they did poor sales
in its UK supermarket chain. In the 28 weeks to September 23, sales grew by
just 1.5% to #450.9m - one of its smallest interim increases for a decade - and
on a like-for-like basis were actually down 2.2%.
Sainsbury appears to have fallen into the complacent trap that ensnared Marks &amp;
Spencer several years ago. It seemed to think that being the biggest clothing
retailer was sufficient to guarantee its future prosperity. But in the meantime
the competition had improved and consumers had become better informed and more
willing to vote with their feet, shopping around for the best deals.
M&amp;S, under Sir Richard Greenbury, has a reputation for corporate arrogance but
at least it is delivering the goods in terms of attractive well-designed
merchandise at reasonable prices. Its premium food products will come into
their own at this time of the year, helping out many a lazy or incompetent cook.
In contrast, Sainsbury's looks rather dowdy compared with some of its jazzier
competitors, several of its ready meals need spicing up and if my own
experience is anything to go by, customer service also could do with a revamp.
Sainsbury has been sniffy about rivals' loyalty card schemes. Chairman and
chief executive David Sainsbury has said that he regards loyalty cards as a
``tactical'' rather than a ``strategic'' weapon. What is not in any doubt is
that so far at least they have delivered impressive sales growth.
Tesco recorded 6% like-for-like sales growth at the interim stage helped by the
launch in February of Clubcard, its national customer loyalty card. So
successful has the Clubcard been that Tesco is eschewing expensive television
advertising in favour of more direct mail to its Clubcard members.
But what has been the striking feature of the food retailing sector in the past
year is the renaissance of the mid-market Asda Group under the stewardship of
chief executive Archie Norman.
The revitalisation of the group has made the stock one of the best performing
in the FTSE-100 index this year. It is recording sales growth well in excess of
its rivals, up 12.6% like-for-like in the 28 weeks to November 11. This despite
spending millions of pounds less on marketing than its main competitors. In
contrast, Sainsbury and the more downmarket Kwik Save has suffered sales
declines.
Asda's success has been attributed to putting clear water between itself and
the other superstore operators. The fresh food offer and the George
childrenswear brand are often cited as keyattractions by shoppers.
Mr Norman himself is keen to stress the company's policy of providing the best
possible value to its customers.
It has received strong publicity from its high-profile assaults on the Net Book
Agreement and more recently on resale price maintenance on vitamins and
medicines. In both cases, Asda's unilateral price-cutting has led others to
follow suit to the benefit of consumers in general.
With Mr Norman reluctant to elaborate on his political ambitions vis-a-vis
becoming a Tory MP, maybe it is time that he was poached from Asda to work his
magic on Sainsbury.

ATHLETICS
ALISON Carr, whose athletics career seemed over when she rejected an American
sports scholarship 12 years ago, has been named by Scotland to make her
international comeback not once, but twice - on the same weekend.
After just one year back in the sport she has been selected for the
inter-league cross-country match at Birmingham a week on Sunday and as reserve
for the World Cross Challenge in Belfast a week on Saturday.
Following two withdrawals from Scotland's team for the match in Northern
Ireland (Sue Ridley and Hayley Haining), Dundee Hawkhill Harrier Carr has now
been summoned to the team proper, and has agreed to run.
She will join Vikki McPherson, the Commonwealth Games team captain, Aberdeen's
Debbie Kilner, and Trudi Thomson, who also steps up from the reserves.
The match attracts some of the world's leading athletes, and the Dundee
housewife's appearance there will cap a remarkable return to the sport.
Carr, a year behind Liz McColgan at St Saviour's, beat the former Liz Lynch's
school and Dundee schools 1500 metres records, as well as winning the British
Schools cross-country title.
Despite the offer of a university scholarship in Iowa - McColgan had gone to
the USA a year earlier - Carr never took up the opportunity, and left the sport
soon after.
``I never dreamed when I started back that I could come this far, so soon,''
she said.
Her performances in the four Scottish women's league matches this winter - a
first, a second, and two thirds -  earned her a place in the inter-league team,
but the Belfast event is more prestigious, and she has opted for that before
trying a couple of serious half-marathons next year.
McPherson's form in Belfast will indicate how realistic are her hopes of
regaining her place in the UK team for the world cross-country championships in
South Africa in March. She missed out this year, having raced the event for the
previous three.
At least four members of the men's team named for Belfast have a prior date
this Saturday in the BUPA international at Durham.
Tom Murray, the World Mountain Racing Trophy silver medal-winner from Spango
Valley, has just recovered from flu and said he may opt out of the Belfast
fixture if he cannot produce reasonable form in Durham. Teams:
Men: Stephen Wylie (Cambuslang), Glen Stewart, David Ross (both Leslie Deans
Racing Club), Adrian Callan, Graham Wight (both Shettleston), Robert Quinn
(Kilbarchan), Tommy Murray (IBM Spango Valley).
Women: V McPherson, Hayley Haining (both City of Glasgow), Sue Ridley
(Edinburgh Woollen Mill), Debbie Kilner (Aberdeen). Reserves: Alison Carr
(Dundee Hawkill Harriers), Sheila Fairweather (CoG), Trudi Thomson (Babcock
Pitreavie).

NOW that awareness of Scottish history has been awakened by the success of the

THE Queen was right to stress the importance of peace-makers in her Christmas
Day message yesterday. In Ireland and Bosnia many would find her thoughts had
an immediacy and a proof recognisable at once from their own experience. In
both cases the peace, though wonderful, remains fragile. In Chechnya, in
Russia's Caucasia, an equally fragile peace effectively brokered last summer,
was sundered in the middle of this month when a group of separatists occupied
the little country's second city, Gudermes, and provoked massive Russian
military retaliation. The retaliation seems to have worked, the town is claimed
to be back under Russian control, but at terrible cost. Half the centre has
been destroyed and more than 100 civilians and rebels have lost their lives in
addition to over 30 Russian soldiers. It hardly seems necessary to have used
such massive power to end what seemed at first to have been a political
demonstration designed to prevent the town voting in local and regional
elections. Once again the authority of Mr Chernomyrdin, the Russian Premier,
and President Yeltsin, who both enjoined restraint, seems to have been ignored
by the military leadership. It is not a good omen for Russia's future more
generally.
The Chechen war should not recommence because of this ugly incident. The case
for an independent Caucasian state the size of Chechnya would have led to the
demand for others not much bigger. What is required is generous autonomy - and
the Russians at least realise that now, if very late in the day.

I WAS saddened to read about the suspension of the Rev Donald Lawrie by the
Presbytery of South Argyll (December 13).
I have known for some time that some members of the Highland Parish Church in
Campbeltown have not seen eye to eye with the minister over his policy with
regard to baptism and marriage. I gather that some of this discontent has
arisen because the ``new'' minister did not do things the way the ``old''
minister would have done them.
Is it fair to judge a new minister, doctor, bank manager, or even candle-stick
maker by comparing their methods with their predecessors'?
As Stewart Lamont pointed out in his recent articles on marriage and baptism,
ministers do have certain obligations to people who reside within their
parishes. But equally there are times when ministers have a discretion on
certain matters.
He also said that this can lead to problems between ministers in neighbouring
parishes, but unfortunately it can also cause conflicts where a long-serving
minister's interpretation of rules differs from his successor's.
Some retiring clerics, to avoid any clash of views with their successors, join
other congregations or even move away from the district after they retire. I
would ask all retiring ministers if it is wise and fair to remain members of
their former churches.

A MAN seriously burned in a house fire early yesterday was fighting for his
life after being taken more than 80 miles by ambulance to find a bed available
in a specialist burns unit.
Mr Harry Butler, 47, suffered serious burns and smoke inhalation in the fire in
Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, and was taken to nearby Tameside
Hospital.
``The man was very seriously burned and he required specialist burns unit care.
Our nearest burns unit is at Withington but there were no beds available
there,'' said a hospital spokesman.
``Our staff then worked progressively through a list and tried several
hospitals before finding a bed available at Selly Oak in Birmingham.''
A spokeswoman at Selly Oak Hospital said later that Mr Butler's condition was
``critical''.
Labour health spokesman Henry McLeish called for an inquiry into yesterday's
incident.
He said: ``This is an absolute scandal on Christmas Day. This has everything to
do with the Government's so-called reforms, and of hospitals competing with
each other.
``It's totally unacceptable that a person in such distress is shuttled between
hospitals before he finds a bed.
``There must be an immediate inquiry by the district health authority and the
Government must now start to listen to its critics and start to put patients
before the current fragmentation of the health service.''

EVERY library in the English speaking world has one, second-hand booksellers do
not like them and the title has just been sold by its American owners to a
Swiss-based investor for a reported #333m.
The Encyclopedia Britannica was first published in Edinburgh 227 years ago, is
today on its 15th edition and costs #1438 in standard 32 volume format . . .
everything from A1 at Lloyd's to Zygote.
Called the Encyclopedia Britannica or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences when it
was first published in 100 weekly numbers, it was expensive by the standards of
the time: ``price 6d each or 8d on a finer paper.'' It ran to three volumes.
Today it comes in 32 volumes and can cost, depending on binding and paper, up
to #4000. Top of the range and owing much to ego-trip marketing is The
Connoisseur which is bound in Morocco goatskin with real gold on the edge of
every page.
According to the more modest first edition, Britannica was ``produced by a
society of gentlemen in Scotland''. . . largely, in fact, by William Smellie, a
printer who later became the encylopedia's editor.
While one body of opinion credits Smellie with having devised the particular
style of the Britannica, other contemporaries said it was Colin Macfarquhar,
who sold Britannica from his printing office in Nicolson Street in Edinburgh,
who was the force behind the encyclopedia and its layout. He edited the first
two editions.
The early volumes were printed in Edinburgh for Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell,
the city's leading engraver.
The first edition contained 2670 pages with the different sciences and arts set
out under 45 cross headings, the longest articles being on anatomy, 166 pages,
and surgery which ran to 238 pages, an understandable concentration given that
Edinburgh was a world centre of medical education.
By the late 1780s, preparation of the third edition was in hand with 300 weekly
numbers planned, each to be sold at the equivalent of 5p in today's currency.
Today, each of the 32 volumes, were they sold separately, would cost #44.93p.
Britannica occupies more than four feet of shelf space and that, according to
Edinburgh antiquarian bookseller Peter Bell, makes it unpopular in the
secondhand book trade.
Contributors to Britannica have included Madame Curie, Sigmund Freud and Albert
Einstein. Today the encyclopedia runs to 44 million words, in addition to the
printed set, can be had on CD and on-line.
The American catalogue company Sears, Roebuck bought Encyclopedia Britannica in
1920. Until its return to Europe earlier this month it has remained in American
ownership.
The money raised by the recent sale by the William Benton Foundation, which
describes itself as ``an Illinois not-for-profit foundation'', will go the
University of Chicago which is the foundation's sole beneficiary.
The new owners are an investment group led by Jacob Safra. He said:
``Britannica is the crown jewel of accumulated knowledge.''
What will the new owners do with their crown jewel? Our goal will be global
distribution to all people, all incomes and all ages,'' said Mr Safra. . .just
what a society of gentlemen in Scotland would have approved of.

THE proverbial two certainties in life are taxes and death, but actually there
is another one - flooding. The people in the West of Scotland who suffered last
year, or those in North Muirton in Perth the year before, are being quite
rational when they say they fear another flood. For there will be more floods -
the only question is when.
Increasingly, the Government is being criticised on two fronts - for not
putting in place an integrated structure, as exists in the Netherlands, to
provide effective flooding control, and for not providing the necessary
resources.
Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, claims his one success
as an Opposition MP scrutinising the Government's Environment Bill was to force
through an amendment making it obligatory for local authorities to consult the
new Scottish Environmental Protection Agency before granting planning
permission in any area liable to flooding.
Yet he, and others, would dearly like to see Sepa's powers and duties
strengthened in regard to flood management.
Elizabeth Leighton, of the World Wide Fund for Nature Scotland, has long
campaigned for the new agency to have a co-ordinating function in the
assessment of flood risk and the design of flood defence strategies.
In November, the Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth announced a review of flood
prevention legislation, suggesting local authorities should be obliged to carry
out flood prevention measures.
Leighton argues, however, that there is little point in giving such a power to
councils without linking Sepa into the system - for while Sepa has the power to
undertake flood risk assessment, councils are under no duty to consult the
agency.
Essentially, most flooding problems are man-made and nothing that man can do
will prevent flooding.
Professor George Fleming, of Strathclyde University's Department of Civil
Engineering, who is one of the country's experts in flood assessment, maintains
that there is no such thing as flood prevention, only measures that can control
the effects of flooding.
He points out that although Scotland has one of the least developed of rural
landscapes, nevertheless there is not a piece of land unaffected by flooding.
As, over the centuries, we have turned land over to farming, cut down trees,
quarried, built reservoirs, constructed fisheries, used rivers for industry and
electrical power, re-routed them, in-filled flood plains, and built along river
banks, is it any wonder that that each major flood has wrought more and more
devastatation?
All we can do when flooding occurs is to mitigate the effects on human
development, perhaps, in some cases, moving settlements from vulnerable areas.
Professor Fleming has proposed to British insurance companies that a map should
be devised classifying the zones in a river basin according to flooding risk.
Householders would then be charged a premium according to flood risk (rather as
is done with risk of car theft) and, he believes, developers would soon learn
not to plan new estates in high-risk areas. To date, his suggestion has not
been adopted.
Take Glasgow, for instance. If the River Clyde is not regularly dredged, it
will flood again as it did last year, perhaps next time in a different place,
damaging a different set of property. In the floods of 1790, people living in
the Gorbals area were marooned from the rest of Glasgow.
The victims of last year's West of Scotland floods are taking comfort from
reports that that was a one in 100-year flood.
However, Professor Fleming warns that does not mean that a similar flood will
not take place for 100 years. It means that statistically such floods are
likely to occur only once in 100 years, but in fact two such floods might occur
side by side, and then none for 200 years.
``Average rainfall has increased over the past 16 to 20 years and in the past
five years we have seen a higher than normal frequency of major events,'' says
Professor Fleming.
Floods of the one in 20-year type have also become more frequent, such as the
floods in Inverness which followed one after the other almost a year to the day
in January 1989 and 1990.
In the case of Paisley last year, the Espedair Burn flooded because of the
volume of water, but the people living around it were affected because
development had been piecemeal and insufficient flood capacity had been built
into the system. Lack of care in keeping culverts and grills clear of debris
contributed greatly to the problem.
``I am looking for a group to take overall responsibility for an integrated
river basin management policy including flood, pollution and droughts,'' says
Professor Fleming.
``I believe Sepa is the best opportunity at this time to have that. Sepa has to
get itself organised for its role in integrated pollution control, but it would
be good for it to get the remit of river-basin management for water as well.
And we need more resources.''
He adds: ``We have a superb ability to manage water and we are equal to the top
in understanding our problems. But for some reason, we have a mind-block when
it comes to building an integrated management system - and yet they have it in
England and Wales.''

OSCAR WILDE once declared that he never travelled without his diary because
``one should always have something sensational to read on the train''.
These days an increasing number of diaries come with ready-written material
which provides, if not sensational reading, at least something mildly
entertaining to while away those moments when you're stuck without a newspaper
on an InterCity Sprinter.
There is, it would appear, a fact-packed pocket diary to suit virtually any
occupation or pastime, from nurses and housewives to beer drinkers and Boy
Scouts. Even countries are catered for. The Scotland Diary, for instance,
features a youthful map of our offshore oil and gas fields.
Ladydate (bound in gold or silver) gives the anniversaries of all Britain's
royals, while the Good Housekeeping Diary includes slim-plan recipes (creamy
fish and pumpkin pie), hints on stain removal, and a two-page menstrual cycle.
If you thought sports fans were only interested in match results and cup
finals, check out the Football Diary which has notes on such diverse
personalities as Robert Burns, Wyatt Earp, and Beatrix Potter.
Drinkers will love the Camra Diary, with its glossary of real-ale jargon, beer
festivals calendar, and a space for whom to notify in case of emergency
(presumably if you overdose on special brew). The Angling Diary gives the
lowdown on strait wagglers, tide tables, and the British record for conger
eels, while the one for pony lovers includes a useful section on snaffle
bridles and tack cleaning and this sound warning to novices: ``Don't let your
pony nibble the tail of the horse in front.''
At an average cost of #5.50 pocket diaries aren't cheap but then, who can put a
price on valuable information like the date of the next Westminster Flower Show
(the Gardeners' Diary) or how many race horses Sheikh Mohammed owns (the Racing
Diary)?
Although Oscar Wilde's diaries may have yielded up enough sensational reading
material to keep tedium at bay on a train journey, how many of us could make a
similar claim?
During a pre-Christmas clearout I came across a cache of old pocket diaries
whose entries were so dull they would have sent Wilde to sleep before the train
had even pulled out of the station.
It seems my life since 1986 (AA Motorists' Diary) has been just one hectic
round of dental appointments, schools closing for the holidays then reopening,
and catching the ferry to Arran although, according to a Boots William Morris
Diary, I did attend the annual show of the Scottish Goldfish Group in 1992.
Eat your heart out, Oscar.

After speaking to men on the countdown to fatherhood, Jonathan Hart examines
the changing life and times of an expectant dad
PREGNANCY is traditionally thought of as a woman's domain. Once the
father-to-be has been congratulated on the conception, it is easy to focus on
the female, overlooking the reactions and feelings of the male.
While reactions vary, most men are pleasantly surprised when they first hear
they are to become a father. Thirty-seven-year-old veterinary lecturer Chris
Little's second child was born six weeks ago.
``With the first one, I was so pleased, I was annoyed that I had to wait nine
months, as I wanted it there and then. I wanted to tell everybody straight
away, but I was cagey at first because people lose babies. But I still told
everyone long before I should have.''
Kim Margie is an antenatal teacher with the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) in
Glasgow. She says that after the initial exhilaration wears off, it is common
for men to experience a mixture of panic and anti-climax as they prepare
themselves for great changes and very little happens.
``As a man, it's almost like you've done your bit. You'll be there at the
delivery, but until then you're not needed in the nitty gritty.''
While many of the woman's changes are physical, the effect on the man can be
more psychological as they worry what the pregnancy might bring. It can also be
a point of crisis between the male and the female, according to Cathy Ritchie,
a psychotherapist at Person Centred Therapy (PCT) in Glasgow.
``A lot of issues in the relationship can come to the fore with the sudden
alteration in lifestyle. The man can feel left out, abandoned in some way.''
As the wife gets more and more attention from relations bringing her presents,
has more frequent appointments with the doctor, and even has people coming up
to her in the street asking when the baby is due, so the man's influence within
the family lessens.
Bill Hollis, a 29-year-old computer analyst programmer, believes it is right
that his wife, who is due in mid-November, gets all the attention.
``After all,'' he says, ``she's the one who's going to have to bear the brunt
of the pregnancy and go through all the pain and suffering.''
But men do react in different ways. Couvade, or sympathetic pregnancy, is the
condition where the man feels symptoms such as backache and even morning
sickness in line with the woman's pregnancy. It has been known for men to have
the symptoms with the partner showing no ill effects at all, though none of the
men contacted for this article experienced any sympathetic symptoms.
Kim Margie is sceptical. ``It would be nice to think the man becomes totally in
tune with his partner, but I think any reaction is due to stress or it may even
be attention-seeking behaviour.''
Building site manager Alex Elliott has noticed a change in his behaviour at
work.
``I think I've mellowed out a bit because I'm so happy. I wouldn't say I was
immature before, but there's a sense of fulfilment in being a father. The
contentment is something I would recommend to anybody.''
Antenatal groups play an important part in a woman's pregnancy and attempts are
made to involve the man as much as possible. The NHS runs a course of seven
two-hour classes which are particularly useful for first-time parents because a
tour of the hospital is incorporated.
Bob McKeating, a 30-year-old computer consultant, was quite happy to go along.
``They're slightly embarrassing to begin with, but there's a room full of
expectant fathers so you're all in the same boat. The tour was good too, though
when we were shown around the delivery room two of the guys felt queasy and had
to sit down, so I don't know how they were going to cope with the real thing.''
The NCT runs a nine-week course which fathers are welcome to attend. They are
encouraged to familiarise themselves with the basic information which mothers
get, to discuss the positive and negative aspects of being pregnant, and to
talk about how they can help their partner during labour. They are also given
the opportunity to discuss the pregnancy from the male point of view.
``We have a couple of classes with men about life with the baby,'' says NCT
administrator Kathy McGlew, ``about how life is going to change, how they feel
about that and how they are going to cope.''
Bill Hollis was slightly apprehensive about going to the classes. ``It was my
wife's idea. I thought it was all going to be very middle class, and I wouldn't
fit in, but I really enjoyed the classes. The people were very nice and I'm
glad I went along.''
One fact discussed at the groups is whether the father wants to be at the
birth. They are warned it can be upsetting to see their partner in distress.
``You do feel utterly useless, a complete spare part,'' says Chris Little, who
was present at the birth of both his children. ``There you are going along to
give moral support and you watch someone you love going through this terrible
suffering and can do nothing about it.''
But his wife, Denise, was glad to have him around. ``It was useful having him
there. I didn't swear at Chris, it was the doctor I told where to go. I think
towards the end though it wouldn't have mattered who was there.''
Kim Margie says: ``There's no doubt that when you see the woman in labour, the
man can be very effective as a support.'' She believes there is a gap in
perception between what the mother and the father see as happening at the birth.
``The man sees the pain and discomfort, whereas the woman in labour sees it
differently, she feels she is in control, and when the baby appears she wants
to do it again. Sometimes, it's as if they've been at different births.''
Nowadays, it is common for the fathers to be at the birth. Kathy McGlew reckons
95% of the future dads who come to her NCT classes attend the delivery.
``It's in the culture now. Men get the support from their friends who were
there for the birth, and they tell them it's not so bad. The men are afraid of
the blood and the mess but they're more often than not standing behind their
partner's head. They don't really get right in there.''
Many men are concerned that they might be very unmanly and pass out. Kim Margie
has never heard of anyone fainting because of the birth, but one did pass out
because of the smell of the cleaner used to wash the baby.
Alex Elliott, whose first baby is due in seven weeks, plans to be at the birth
but worries he might be a little squeamish.
``They think that's hilarious on the building site where I work, but I'm
definitely going to be there. Whether I'm compos mentis is another matter.''
Chris Little, being a vet, was used to the potentially squeamish scenario. He's
just caught up in the whole idea of being a dad.
``You feel as a man you don't deserve it because the woman has been through all
the pains, the waddling around, the clothes that don't fit and you did
nothing.''
For Frank Melin-Higgins, Alex Elliott, and Bill Hollis the birth and further
upheaval are still to come. ``I can't wait to go out walking with it strapped
to my chest and just talking to it,'' says Frank, a 40-year-old set designer.
``I've been talking through my wife Maggie's tummy telling it where I'm going
to take it.''
Alex is also looking forward to the closeness with the baby. ``I can picture
myself holding and cuddling this wee being belonging to me and my wife.''
For Bill, there is the realisation his whole life and that of his wife, Anne,
is going to be turned upside down.
``I think we're both aware of that, but I can honestly say there's not a moment
when I haven't wanted Anne to be pregnant.''

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
THE post-season picture came into focus with San Diego Chargers, Indianapolis
Colts, Atlanta Falcons, and Miami Dolphins claiming the last four play-off
spots with wins in the final week of the regular NFL season.
The Dolphins squeezed into the play-offs, where they face a freezing visit to
AFC East Division champions Buffalo Bills on Saturday. Miami crushed St Louis
41-22, but also needed a win from Denver Broncos over Oakland Raiders.
With their own win wrapped up minutes earlier, the Dolphins anxiously watched
the closing moments on television as Broncos quarterback John Elway
orchestrated another come-from-behind victory to dump the Raiders 31-28.
Atlanta edged into the play-offs, and an equally chilly match against the Green
Bay Packers at icy Lambeau Field next Sunday, after back-up quarterback Bobby
Hebert helped hold off San Francisco 49ers 28-27.
Falcons kicker Morten Andersen set a season mark of eight for field goals of 50
or more yards, kicking a 52-yarder in the first quarter and a 59-yarder -
fourth-longest in NFL history - just before half-time. Another record was set
by 49ers' receiver Jerry Rice, with 12 catches for 153 yards to break the NFL's
single-season record with 942 catches - three more than Philadelphia's Art Monk
- and 1848 yards this season.
San Diego secured their play-off berth at home to Indianapolis Colts this
Saturday with a 27-14 away defeat of the New York Giants on Saturday.
Snowball-throwing Giants fans ignored tannoy warnings and almost forced the
first-ever abandonment of an NFL match when they pelted the Chargers sidelines
during the second half. Police arrested 14 fans and more than 100 were thrown
out after Chargers official Sid Brooks was hit in the face by a snowball and
knocked unconscious.
Indianapolis went through on the boot of kicker Corey Blanchard, who hit a
30-yard field goal for a 10-7 win over New England after a nail-biting,
error-strewn finale.
Detroit Lions, already assured of a play-off place, beat Tampa Bay Buccaneers
37-10 but were pipped for the NFC Central title, as Green Bay beat Pittsburgh
Steelers 24-19.
Chicago Bears just missed out despite a 24-10 win over Philadelphia Eagles,
whose loss gifted the NFC East title to Dallas Cowboys, who also get a
first-round bye.
Minnesota Vikings collapsed out of the play-off race with a 27-24 loss to lowly
Cincinnati after having led 24-3 at the half.
Play-off picture: Saturday, December 30 - Miami at Buffalo (AFC); Detroit at
Philadelphia (NFC). Sunday, December 31 - Indianapolis at San Diego (AFC);
Atlanta at Green Bay (NFC). First-round byes - Pittsburgh, Kansas City (AFC);
Dallas, San Francisco (NFC).
Week 17 results: Saturday - Detroit 37, Tampa Bay 10; New England 7,
Indianapolis 10; San Diego 27, New York Giants 17. Sunday - Carolina 17,
Washington 20; Cleveland 21, Jacksonville 24; Denver 31, Oakland 28; Houston
28, Buffalo 17; Miami 41, St Louis 22; Minnesota 24, Cincinnati 27; New Orleans
12, New York Jets 0; Philadelphia 14, Chicago 20; Pittsburgh 19, Green Bay 24;
San Francisco 27, Atlanta 28; Seattle 3, Kansas City 26.

IN ENGLAND
BATH'S Pilkington Cup machine rolls on after their triumph over second division
Northampton.
The holders made it 48 cup wins in 51 ties since January 1984, remaining on
course for a fourth `double' and a tenth Twickenham triumph in 13 seasons.
The clash between the runaway leaders of divisions one and two was won by
Jonathan Callard's four penalties.
Paul Grayson, the man who succeeded him as England's kicker, was allowed only a
solitary kick at goal.
``We were determined to keep the ball in hand as much as possible,'' said Bath
coach Brian Ashton.
``Though disappointed, Northampton proved to everybody that they will thrive in
League one when they are promoted next year.
Coach Ian McGeechan said: ``Our aim is to be in the top three of League one
next season.
``As we are averaging 50 points a game in the League it is clear that there is
a 50-point difference between first and second division opposition, but we are
confident of bridging the gap.''
London's premier teams, Wasps and Harlequins, came from behind to survive
testing ties in the north west in the two all-first-division ties.
Wasps captain Lawrence Dallaglio scored his team's winner at Sale while Will
Carling dragged Harlequins to within touching distance of Orrell, although two
late penalties from Paul Challinor were required to clinch their place in round
five.
All the other five first division sides had wide-margin wins over opposition
from lower down the league.
Leicester topped a century of points in two ties against Exeter without reply,
adding 27 points to the 76 they scored three seasons ago.
Bristol hammered Reading 44-7, Saracens overcame Rugby 27-7, Gloucester smashed
Walsall 47-0, and West Hartlepool recorded their first competitive win of the
season.
They had lost all 10 in the league, but took out their frustration on
Weston-super-Mare, although 25-9 was a less convincing win than should have
been expected against a division five team.
Newcastle gave Rob Andrew and his waiting stars a hope that they could have
meaningful competitive rugby when they qualify in February.
Newcastle easily beat Moseley 26-5, but they must still win their fifth round
tie in January if Andrew and his qualifying colleagues are to have a decent cup
match.
In the other second division clash Nottingham shocked London Scottish 32-16.
The biggest surprise of the 16 ties was fourth division Leeds' 20-15 victory
over Waterloo.

SCOTLAND will face the new Cruyff in the European Championship Finals in
England next summer.
Holland have won the battle with Spain for Jordi, the son of Barcelona manager
Johan.
Until now Cruyff junior, who is also an attacking midfielder, has repeatedly
refused to play for either country until he decided where his future lay.
But he has told Dutch coach Guus Hiddink that he wants to follow in his
father's footsteps and play for Holland.
Scotland's top scorer Pierre van Hooydonk could join Cruyff in the Dutch attack.
Hiddink, revealing yesterday that Cruyff had opted to go Dutch, said: ``He is a
very talented player who will provide a straight replacement for Marc Overmars,
who will be out with a knee injury for another eight months.
``I also will be looking at van Hooydonk over the next two months. There is no
way I can ignore a player who is top scorer in Scotland.
``He knows the British style of play better than anyone in our squad and could
be a valuable option for the championships.''
Cruyff is expected to recover from a serious knee injury in time for his debut
in the first of Holland's friendlies against Belgium in February.
Another warm-up against Germany has been arranged and the Dutch are also
negotiating with the Republic of Ireland to complete their preparations.
Cruyff senior said yesterday: ``I left the decision entirely to Jordi. He was
born in Holland, our roots are still there, and he feels Dutch just as I do.
``It has been much more difficult for him to escape my shadow and establish
himself.
``There were accusations of favouritism when I brought him into the Barcelona
team but he has coped with it all to earn his place strictly on merit.''
q AJAX marched to their seventeenth win in 18 Dutch league matches this season
as they dispatched NEC Nijmegen 3-1.
Ajax, facing up to being without international winger Marc Overmars for the
rest of the campaign, extended their lead over second-placed PSV Eindhoven to
eight points.
Goals by Finn Jari Litmanen, Nigerian Finidi George, and a penalty from Ronald
de Boer carried Ajax to success. They have scored 62 goals in their league run
of 17 wins and one draw and conceded only six.
The Amsterdam side were undistracted by the absence of Overmars, whom the club
learned on Friday would be out of action for six months after tearing a left
knee ligament in Wednesday's 1-0 league win over De Graafschap Doetinchem.
q LES Sealey is set to fulfil a childhood dream today by playing in goal for
West Ham at home to his former club Coventry.
Ludek Miklosko was beaten four times in the Hammers' Premiership defeat at
Middlesbrough on Saturday and serves a one-match ban against the Sky Blues.
And now Sealey cannot wait for the Coventry fixture, although he has already
technically made his West Ham debut after being forced to play for six minutes
outfield at Arsenal earlier in the season.
``I've always wanted to play for West Ham. I supported them as a child and I am
looking forward to it. Then I will have done everything I can in football,''
said the former Manchester United, Aston Villa, and Luton keeper.
Manager Harry Redknapp is hoping for a better performance from his team after
their defensive frailties were exposed in the 4-2 defeat at Middlesbrough's
Riverside Stadium.
Redknapp made his side watch a video of the game and says: ``There'll be
several replacements in the near future - I am going to improve the team.
``People can't do their jobs defensively and only Julian Dicks came out of the
game with any credit in that department.
``The goals were almost funny, schoolboy errors.''

THERE has been a revival in media interest concerning the safety of the food we
eat. The issues raised have included listeria in cheese, veterinary residues in
pork and BSE transmission to humans from beef. In all of these cases there is a
need to balance the potential risks to health against the impact of control
measures.
All human enterprise involves risks but in Scotland eating is one of the safer
activities.
That may appear complacent but the fact that such a statement can be sustained
is an indication of the considerable efforts made by government and industry to
ensure food safety.
The judgment of when risk reaches an unacceptable level is a complex matter and
individuals need to rely on expert opinion which in turn is represented in
legislation.
The answer to some food safety issues is fairly straightforward; clearly food
at the point of eating should not be contaminated with pathogenic
micro-organisms, harmful levels of acute toxins nor dangerous foreign matter
such as glass or sharp metal fragments.
In these cases, where a clear link between cause and effect exists,
implementation of legislation coupled with good agricultural and manufacturing
practice help to ensure food safety.
In many cases, the situation is less clear-cut and quite difficult decisions
need to be made in order to establish safe levels. These levels address the
severity and the extent of the threat to health.
In most cases the safety levels reflect the point at which no adverse reaction
is observed and include a substantial margin to allow for uncertainties in the
assumptions on which they are based.
As a general principle it is desirable to have rather lower levels than those
arrived at by safety concerns, and so action limits will be set on the basis of
being as low as reasonably achievable by good agricultural and manufacturing
practice (the so called ALARA principle).
It is on this basis that maximum residue levels (MRLs) are set for pesticides
in foods. These levels wil necessarily be less than any defined safety levels
and represent a level where corrective action should be taken although the food
can still be safe to eat.
The ALARA concept can lead to different levels being set to meet different
circumstances, eg limits for nitrate in green vegetables vary according to the
time of year.
In some cases long-term exposure to very low doses may be harmful and the ideal
level is zero. This may not be practicable or monitorable and the tolerable
levels are necessarily based on what is achievable and measurable.
Sometimes changes in procedure at one point in the food chain have unexpected
consequences for the rest of the food chain. For example the improvement in the
chill distribution chain has extended shelf-life before spoilage occurs; this
is clearly beneficial.
However, it has meant that pathogenic organisms capable of growing slowly at
low temperatures have more opportunity to develop in the food. Consequently
improving the chill distribution chain has put greater demands on the food
production chain to minimise bacterial contamination before the foods enter the
distribution chain.The approach to food safety problems at the practical level
is one of risk assessment and management. Suppliers of food for consumption
need to consider what hazards may desecrate their food and what the
consequences may be.
In this process they will naturally rely on the opinions of expert panels. This
process of risk assessment and management in the UK food production chain
allows us to be confident that our food is indeed safe to eat. The maintenance
of this condition is essential, not only for food safety reasons, but also to
ensure the competitiveness of the Scottish food industry.

LORIMER Mackenzie, a former Scottish Office civil servant, is the top Scottish
Eurocrat in Brussels and chairman of the recently-formed Scottish European
Association of 120 members.
Mackenzie, 55, a senior European Commission fisheries expert, has worked at the
heart of Europe for 22 years and sees Scottish attitudes to Europe forged by a
tradition of distinctive education and a strong sense of consensus and the
common good.
When he arrived in Brussels he decided to send his children to the European
school for Eurocrats' families where the baccalaureate is the norm, in common
with most of Europe - except England.
``That was my first lesson in just how different the Scots are from the
English,'' he says. ``We do not appreciate just how different we really are in
our lifestyles and how or societies are organised.''
When Britain joined the EU, British immigrant Eurocrats - mainly English -
immediately demanded a change in the European school's ethos.
``They wanted English A Levels and an English education. Some of us Scots
campaigned on the parents' committee that we did not want it turned into an
English school because European education had far more in common with Scottish
ideas. We were well received because we refused to accept an English system.
Mixing and adapting and a broad base were what we wanted.
``The Department of Education in England said that if you had an average
baccalaureate pass of 80% in nine subjects, it might be equivalent of a bare
pass in three A Levels. In other words, they were so arrogant about the quality
of English education that they thought a mark attained by less than 1% of the
brightest pupils in Europe was equivalent to a mere pass in England.
``The Scottish and English universities had a different approach. England said
they were inherently superior and would not take high-quality graduates. The
Scottish Education Department said anyone from this school would be a good
student anyway and if there was a worry about adapting to specialised subjects
the department would offer advice.
``The examination results showed the Scots were right. This is only anecdotal
but it is also typical of certain attitudes. London thinks it has nothing to
learn. Scotland thinks it is happy with what it has got, but it wants to see
what other people have to offer.''
``We had an education system which had been recognised throughout Europe as one
of the best in the world for 600 years and produced the highest per capita
number of graduates in Western Europe. But London did not go to Edinburgh and
ask how this was achieved, it went to Germany and France. It is a peculiar
arrogance which supposes if it is English it must be superior. But the Scots
took the view there was always something to learn from neighbours.''
Mackenzie says the refusal of the Conservative Government in the Thatcher years
to speak to others in Scotland - such as the Scottish Council or trade unions -
never quite worked because of bred-in-the-bone Scottish attitudes. ``We always
recognised that we needed each other,'' he says.
``Some years ago the heads of the three churches - Church of Scotland, Roman
Catholics and Anglicans - went to Balmoral one August with a ban-the-bomb
petition. It was ignored in England because they could not understand why
clergymen would get involved at that level of politics. But in Scotland it was
understood because church people had no loyalty to government, but they had to
the Crown.
``Even Catholics don't bother about Secretaries of State. Churches recognise
their constituencies, their people. The same thing happens in places like
Belgium with its communes and local democracy right down to the lowest possible
level.
``I have heard of visitors from England who find life in Edinburgh more foreign
than life in Brussels. They don't expect the differences between Scotland and
England, parts of the same state, to be so great. There are examples all around.
``Why are the Scots slower to go in for trust hospitals? Why is Scotland not
adopting this business of governing bodies in schools? Why are we not opting
out of things like the English? It is not because we are great theological
socialists, it is because we don't see the relevance. In fact, we see the
damage it can cause.
He adds: ``It was revealing when Malcolm Rifkind appointed Tories to quangos in
Scotland. In effect, he was saying he had to find people who believed in
government policy and the only people who really believed it in Scotland were
Tory Party apparatchiks. It was a completely different way of dealing with
Scotland - it was the south-eastern approach - and nothing like the way the
bulk of the Scottish people felt.''
Lorimer Mackenzie laughs at the very senior British Eurocrat from England who
visited Scotland on holiday. He came back to Brussels and beamed: ``Isn't it
wonderful to find somewhere in the United Kingdom where they actually like
Europe?''

THE concept of the founding fathers of the Common Market was of an enlarged
trading block of nations with the movement of goods, services, and people, one
object being to stimulate trade between the member countries.
However, the integration of the members in a single currency and defence system
with each other is a very different ball-game fraught with very real and
profound dangers.
The Common Fisheries Policy has been an unmitigated disaster for fishing
communities, which will face a very rapid terminal decline for both the
industry and the fish stocks when the Spanish fishing fleet and others gain
access to our traditional fishing areas.
The question must be: do we really want to get into bed with them, with no
control over our fiscal and defence decisions, and the far-reaching
implications it will have for the future wellbeing and standard of living of
our citizens?
While a referendum on these issues would be desirable if not essential, there
is no point in having one until all the pros and cons are made available to
people.

IN response to the recent press reports concerning the International Burns
Festival and in particular the remarks attributed to Brian Donohoe, MP, I write
to clear up the obvious confusion.
I am delighted to report that all of the official events to mark the
bicentenary in 1996 of the death of Robert Burns are well in hand.
As Burns is buried in Dumfries it was left to the local Burns clubs under the
auspices of the Burns Federation, and greatly assisted by our local councils,
to organise the official events surrounding the bicentenary of his death, and a
fully funded programme is now in place. The important parade on Sunday, July
21, is being generously supported by ScottishPower and the full day's programme
will ensure lasting memories for all visitors to the town. Seats for the
commemorative dinner, the same evening, are filling quickly and many other
interesting events are taking place throughout the year, commencing with a
lantern parade through the town on January 20.
The International Burns Festival was a body set up by Ayrshire and
Dumfriesshire local authorities to organise a series of high-profile
Burns-related events, mainly in west central Scotland. Although it is
regrettable that the IBF plans are under pressure this in no way affects the
grassroot celebrations in which Burnsians from home and abroad will take part
next year. You are all welcome to join us.
Anyone wishing a copy of the programme for the 1996 Burns events in Dumfries
should write to Dumfries &amp; Galloway Tourist Board, Campbell House, Bankend
Road, Dumfries DG1.

WHEN police raked through the wreckage of a house in which a three-month-old
girl was badly burned they found between 20 and 25 discarded and used needles
and syringes under the mattress of a bunk bed, as well as 12 needles and
syringes in a kitchen drawer.
As a result of the fire in February 1991, Lisa Morrison, now aged five,
suffered severe injuries to her face and hands, losing her right hand and the
fingers of her left.
She remained in the intensive treatment unit of the Royal Hospital for Sick
Children for two weeks. On her discharge she and her brother and two sisters,
who suffered no injury apart from smoke inhalation, were then placed in care.
Their father, James Morrison, had left the family home in late summer, 1990
because of his wife's drug misuse.
He had also raised with the social work department his concerns about the
children being left in the care of his wife.
While the social work department claimed they had no evidence of drug misuse by
the mother, Mr Morrison's home had gained the reputation of being a ``drug
haunt''.
Mr Morrison, who was working in England at the time of the fire, had provided
witnesses to back up his concerns for the safety of his children. He had known
of the unpleasant domestic situation at the time when Lisa was born, but around
Christmas and New Year the situation appeared to become ``disastrous''.
And January had been absolute chaos. He hated to think what the children were
being subjected to day and night, but in his view the domestic crisis seemed to
go unnoticed by the social work department because the people assigned to the
case seemed only to work between 9am and 5pm.
After the fire the children were in care for 10 months when the decision was
finally made that they could be returned to him.
But that 10 months amounted to yet another a nightmare for Mr Morrison. He
states: ``They told me if I gave up my work I could have have the children back.
``But they placed the kids at Quarrier's Homes; so five and six days a week I
was leaving the house in Springburn at 9.30am and travelling out to Quarrier's
using a bus pass from the social work department.''
Quarrier's Village is probably two or three miles from Bridge of Weir. Mr
Morrison had to face a walk of two to three miles along a country road to reach
the homes.
Says Mr Morrison: ``Unfortunately there's nothing to do in Quarrier's Village.
It's a beautiful place in the summer, but in the winter it's wild. When I saw
the kids we were doing the same thing every day.
``I was asking social work: Could you give me some money to take the kids
somewhere for the day just to break up this routine?"
HE explained: "We were just going little walks around the village. But if the
weather was bad, which it was quite a lot, then we just had to stay in the
house where the kids were placed and amuse them as best I could.''
A further problem for Mr Morrison was that the three older children were in one
house and Lisa was in another because of her condition.
He recalls: ``This went on for months and months and I was cracking up. I
wasn't getting back home until nine or 10 at night. And during the walk, I was
exposed to the elements and often I was soaked through and freezing cold. It
was a nightmare.
``This went on day after day after day.
In his view the situation was ``totally out of order''.
The department would invite him down to a meeting with social workers, and they
would ``play little mind games''.
They'd ask him about his feelings towards the children; his feelings about the
children being in care; and his feelings about the fire.
His argument was that social work had placed the children in care when there
was no need to do so. He couldn't understand why the children were being kept
in care for so many months.
All this time there were different case conferences arranged with people from
the schools and the nursery that Lisa attended.
Mr Morrison remembers bitterly: ``From the day after the fire they knew how
angry I was about why it had been allowed to happen. I saw it as a tragedy just
waiting to happen. They knew how I felt about it.
``I suspect they were wary of the fact that I might make a complaint and that's
why I wasn't getting the kids. They knew I had gone out of my way to bring to
their attention to what was going on with the mother and so they were trying to
protect the department.
``They didn't want me to get the kids back home. They did everything in their
power to make me give up.''
He concludes: ``These feelings of bitterness don't just go away. They will
eventually. I always told myself that once this was all over and I got all of
this off my chest this was going to be the start of a new life for me and the
kids.
``If you go to my children's schools and nursery they would all give you
favourable reports about how the kids are presented. I think my kids are
happier than they've ever been. They're happy staying with their dad.''
The fight to save his family sparked a 10-month nightmare for a father who
feared he was going to lose his children, as he tells John MacCalman

n EVEN before the bells have rung, the chime of cash registers in the run up to
next year's big-spending festivals is sounding. An optimistic press release
from party stationers Duni, which suggests that their ``cheeky'' Easter chicks
napkins wipe out the sheer hell that is chocolate smears on young faces
(``children will be queuing up'') while their hen and rabbit candles get them
rushing to the dining table - and you thought it was mum's home cooking.
n THE Valentine's day press releases are also trickling in, among them a
charming idea from jeweller Dominic Walmsley, who will engrave the romantic

The floods have subsided, but they have left their mark. Elizabeth Buie talks
to householders for whom the torment goes on
STORM clouds on the horizon, warnings of abnormally high tides, a flurry of
snow - they are enough to induce fear in pockets of the Scottish population.
Neither phobics nor neurotics, they are the victims of floods - in Paisley,
Kirkintilloch, Perth, Aberdeenshire, or Inverness, and countless other places.
For their lives will never be the same after the destruction wrought by a tide
of water, invading their homes, lapping up their walls, sweeping some of their
most prized possessions down the street to watery oblivion.
Maria Scobie was one of the residents in Ferguslie Park Avenue, Paisley, who
had to flee her home to escape the floods of last December. Now she is
terrified of having a bath. Her doctor assures her that gradually, by adding a
little more bathwater each time, she will overcome her fear. But she is not
sure. She thinks it is because by the time she left her house, the water-level
was so high.
Her previous rude health has gone. She is on medication for stress-related
illnesses and receiving treatment for a fungal infection on her feet which she
picked up last year wading through the floodwater.
She returned home only three weeks ago. 1995 has not been a happy year for her
- she dreams only of getting it behind her and looking forward to better times
next year.
``There is plenty of rain still to come - and if we get a heavy snowfall it
will be just as bad. I only want winter to be past. I am still frightened, even
with the improvement. If it rains the same way as last year, there is no
guarantee it won't happen again,'' she said. ``I think it was a fluke - I want
to believe that. It rained for 48 hours non-stop.''
Financially, she has not suffered severe hardship. Her house was less than a
year old when it was flooded and has now been thoroughly dried out and
virtually rebuilt. But she has lost some of her most treasured possessions -
things that can never be replaced, like videos of her grandchildren,
photographs that were hanging on the wall of her stairs.
Out of adversity has come some good, however. Victims of the flooding started
up their own social club to offer each other support. Mrs Scobie smiles with
pride when she describes the club's Christmas outing to a Daniel O'Donnell
concert in Glasgow at which the singer gave them a special mention.
Renfrew District Council and Ferguslie Park Housing Association have agreed
with tenants to set up an insurance scheme covering everyone for fire or flood
damage. It will cost people like Mrs Scobie an extra #2 a week, but she reckons
it's worth it.
She has nothing but praise for the support provided by the council, social
workers, and the public who donated money and furnishings. In fact, as
landlords, the district council spent #2m on repairs to the flooded homes and
at least #450,000 on repairs to the drainage system to protect its housing
stock.
Ironically, residents in relatively affluent Kirkintilloch feel more
victimised. As owner-occupiers they have not been able to rely on housing
associations, or council housing department officials, to sort out their
problems. True, local MP Sam Galbraith has negotiated on their behalf with
insurers, but they remain bitter.
They are convinced that they have been the real victims of local government
reorganisation. Strathclyde Regional Council, the authority with powers and
duties to alleviate flooding, says it has no money to tackle the multi-million
pound problem as it needs to be done. As a last gesture, the council has asked
the Scottish Office to match its offer of #40,000 to carry out an #80,000 study
to assess the flood measures needed for Strathkelvin. But residents feel it's
too little, too late.
Strathkelvin District Council has no statutory power or obligation to act in
such circumstances. So the people wait for April, when the new East
Dunbartonshire authority will take over, and hope the new councillors will
fulfil their promises.
Donald Mackinnon and his wife Regine, of Kelvin Way, are deeply frustrated at
what they see as complete inaction.
``There has been no improvement to the riverbank or anything in relation to the
Kelvin or its tributaries. We are actually no different than we were a year
ago,'' said Mr Mackinnon, who is acting chairman of the fledgling Kirkintilloch
and District Flood Action Group.
All the domestic houses in the area have been repaired, but some elderly
residents who looked after themselves independently before the flooding have
not recovered from the trauma and will remain in nursing homes or sheltered
homes for the rest of their lives.
Inevitably, there are question-marks over house values, and some businesses
have threatened to move to another area which is not at risk of flooding.
``I was surprised at the resilience at the time of the flooding. It was quite
wonderful watching the reactions of people. The funny thing is that it was
later on, several months later, that some were suffering quite a bit.
``There was a danger of flooding again six weeks ago, and when the lorries
started bringing sandbags into the end of the street, it was amazing to watch
people. They were prowling around in the middle of the night with torches
watching to see what the river would do,'' he said.
``In Ferguslie Park, the houses were largely owned by the district council, so
it was in their own interest to get something done about it - so Ferguslie was
better off in a way. Ferguslie Park got the main media coverage at the time -
Kirkintilloch was rather peripheral - and possibly that helped them as well
because they were highlighted nationally. It makes politicians move faster. In
our case there was probably an attitude that they own their houses, so it is up
to them to get them covered.''
Mr Mackinnon is also concerned that the new authority will not have the
resources that the region might have had to do the job.
``The River Kelvin does not know political boundaries. It affects a lot of
places which previously were all within Strathclyde region. Now it wends its
way through more than one local authority. We could get the situation that East
Dunbartonshire does something dramatic to prevent flooding in the Kirkintilloch
area which could have repercussions in the river doing its Zambezi act and
overspilling in Glasgow as happened last year,'' he said.
Strathkelvin and Bearsden MP Sam Galbraith has tremendous sympathy for his
constituents who were hit by the floods.
``There was some recent heavy rainfall and I went into Kirkintilloch on the
morning after. One woman was devastated. For a lot of them it was a tremendous
psychological blow. They had water up their stairs taking their paintings off
the walls. And there, they could see the water coming up their paths again.
Until we get flood prevention, they will always have that fear,'' he said.

WE got off to an auspicious start when the spotlights dimmed and the death
metal music cranked up. Thirty of us eagerly watched the two gift-wrapped
wooden boxes that constituted the stage set. For five full minutes. Finally,
there was a surprised voice off-stage: ``Whit? Time tae go?'' Perhaps, we
should have.
The swing doors stage right banged open and in stomped Mr Claus himself. He was
obviously worse for wear as he clung on to his beer bottle and stumbled into a
wall. But then our hero spoke. ``F*** you!'' he pronounced and staggered behind
the curtain. This, for a tale about Santa, was going to have very little magic.
Santa's Dead would be the nightmare vision of Christmas if James Kelman ever
decided to move into writing pantomime - one easy lesson in the improper use of
four-letter words. It's not that the choice language particularly offended, but
it all seemed to fit uneasily with the spirit of the season.
I'm not quite sure what Santa's Dead is all about; equally, I'm not sure it
matters. The format seems to be panto but the delivery polemic.
The jist of the tale is one family's poverty forcing them to tell their
youngster, Tommy, that the bearded bearer of gifts has been murdered. The sad
wee soul - ably played by Wullie Brennan - informs the police and what follows
is a constable's search to get to the bottom of it all.
In fact, the piece is more a series of one-joke sketches and songs that would
have embarrassed the Rainbow team. See visual jokes: dad hits mum on head with
copy of The Big Issue, but look the back page is emblazoned with a Zero
Tolerance poster.
The social comments are loud and proud. The Twelve Days of Christmas is
transformed by three loutish druggies into an over-long glance at Scotland's
drug culture where every gift becomes a banned substance.
For her rendition of the Queen's message, Julie Campbell gave a fine impression
of Black Adder's Queenie, but the joke on the Christmas tree and lavatory brush
- in keeping with the overall tone rather than flash in the pan - was a
stinker.
Raymond Burke, who wrote and co-directed the play, was having a fine time in
his many guises, trying with unabashed gusto to give the piece the cohesive
whole it so lacked. His portrayal of Misrule in black leather mini-skirt raised
a snigger, and his Mr Bum, an incorrigible guitar twanger who appears on an
episode of Question Time, was an effective parody of the kind of inane TV
entertainer we all know and loathe. Funny, if you like your Rab C Nesbit.

<HEADLINE>Ford leads drive for side-impact airbags</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CAR airbags to protect drivers and passengers in side-impact crashes as well as
head-on collisions could be a regular feature in British vehicles within five
years, says Ford, the UK's leading car seller.
The firm hopes to bring in the side-collision airbag to protect heads and
chests in all its vehicles in Europe and North America within three to five
years. Other manufacturers are expected to follow suit.
Ford was the first company to have ``head-on'' airbags as standard in all its
cars in the UK, with its big-selling Mondeo model the first car to come with an
airbag already fitted.
Now Ford and other manufacturers are busy working on the side-impact airbag
which will be attached to front seats.
Side crashes are seen as even more dangerous than head-on ones and the Ford
bags will give better protection to the head and chest.
The existing driver's front airbag, located in the centre of the steering
wheel, is designed to inflate automatically within 30 milliseconds of a
front-on crash. It then deflates progressively, as the driver's head meets it,
to cushion the impact.
``The side-impact bags will be triggered by slightly different censors than the
frontal ones. They'll provide a cushion between the occupant and side of the
vehicle,'' said a Ford spokesman.
Volvo has already introduced some side airbags. The Ford one is expected to
cost about #270.

Research into the effects of a man shortage on marriage market forces has more
than a whiff of controversy, as VICTORIA FREEDMAN
discovers
THERE has been some anger, some ridicule in response to a report from the
Centre for Economics and Business Research which found that there is going to
be a shortage of men in the coming years. This demographic swing, it was
predicted, will alter the sexual balance of power and have a significant social
and economic impact. The report's author, Mihir Warty, advised, ``businesses
should take advantage of this. More women will be entering the labour market
and they will have more purchasing power.''
Meanwhile, the centre's chief executive, Professor Douglas McWilliams,
predicted that ``women will not be able to drive such a hard bargain in the
marriage market''. They might have to work harder to attract men by perhaps
reducing their insistence on a long-term commitment or providing a greater
level of promiscuity. The press release accompanying the report spelled out the
message ``men won't have to pay so much, bad news for sales of aftershave and
roses, women will have to pay more, good news for sales of perfumes and
mini-skirts''.
Of course it was bound to annoy the independent, intelligent woman. To suggest
that perfume and mini-skirts are what it takes to attract a man, that she will
become desperate, that she will be in competition with her sisters . . .
What rot, was the response from Renate Olins, director of London Marriage
Guidance, who pointed out that the real power lies with money, not with sexual
behaviour, so for women marriage is an option now, not a necessity. What
ignorance, said those aware of the threat of HIV and other sexually transmitted
diseases who are underlining the need for less promiscuity.
What nonsense, said those single mothers having a very hard time financially,
emotionally, and practically, yet refusing to enter an unsatisfactory
relationship.
Even men realised it was rot.
`Women are so much more confident now. If they can't get a good man they will
happily settle for none rather than a rubbishy one,'' said David Thomas, author
of Not Guilty: Defence of the Modern Man. ``The problem is there are a lot of
rubbishy men about.''
His last remark requires some examination, which in turn raises further issues.
First, what is a rubbishy man?
There seems to be an equally powerful reaction among middle-class women who are
fed up with trying to have it all, the career, the baby, the nanny, and the sex
life.
So those women may well start to compete for what you call the A-grade men,
those who have degrees and jobs and are worth having.
Many women would of course still argue that they are perfectly happy with their
careers and single life and do not feel the need to compete for any man, not
even an A-grade one.
Frances Pyne, from Dateline International, a computer introduction service that
has 37,000 members, is not so sure. ``More British women are working than their
European counterparts but I'm tempted to think it is less a matter of choice
and has more to do with needing the money. And in general terms, both men and
women prefer to have a partner.''
She would say that, but then so would a large number of women if they could
admit it to themselves, believes David Thomas. Additionally, it may well be
that some women are angry that the recent kind of feminism denied their
femaleness, that it brought the agonising realisation that they do actually
want children but time is running out and there is no suitable partner in
sight. For those who do have children, some are finding they rather prefer to
stay at home but are reliant on a partner's earnings. Certainly, many women do
not have the earning power often suggested and in reality many women do
continue to endure unhappy, even dangerous relationships, and men are attracted
to women wearing mini-skirts.
So how do men feel?
``I suspect quite a lot are feeling pretty rotten at the moment,'' says Thomas.
``I think there's a sense that they can't win. A friend of mine is married to a
very successful man who was made redundant and has settled into his life as New
Man very happily. But she hates being the breadwinner. She doesn't feel her
husband is a real man any more. So if men are macho they're accused of being
sexist pigs. For the past 30 years they've been told they shouldn't be real
men, but nor should they be New Men . . . I think the big rebellion of the
early 21st century will come from men saying, `hang on, why do I have to put up
with my old sex role and keep on working so hard?'''
These indeed are issues to be faced.
Thomas believes the best model for society may not be to have men working flat
out with a housewife at home, or both partners working flat out with a nanny at
home, but both partners working some of the time and more of the time at home.
If they find the partner in the first place.

Stewart Lamont reviews the Woman's Guild, unkindly tagged the Blue Rinse
Brigade, whose leaders want to change its stereotypical image as part of a
strategy for survival
IF EVER there was an organisation with an image, it is the Kirk's Woman's
Guild. The trouble is, the image is not altogether flattering or accurate. The
stereotype of blue-rinsed matrons presiding over trestle tables at
bring-and-buy sales, or singing hymns (from the old hymnary) to the
accompaniment of a plonky piano in a church hall, is not without some truth.
But it is far from true in many instances and the present leadership of the
guild is planning to see that their image changes fast - before it becomes
fossilised and consigned to become a footnote in the church history of this
century much in the way that temperance societies have become a footnote to
church history of last century.
With 55,000 members the guild is still a formidable footnote, particularly as
the level of dedication of the members is high. But so is their average age.
The 1500 branches throughout Scotland are supplemented by 250 young women's
groups containing 4300 members, but many of them have no wish to go on to
become guildswomen.
The guild has set itself the task of finding out why and what to do about it.
Last week the final stages of a three-year consultation were completed and by
February a blueprint will emerge that will require the endorsement of the
Kirk's General Assembly in May.
The relationship of the two bodies was always one of subservience by the guild
which meekly accepted a tiny slot in proceedings in return for its very own
annual Assembly in the spring in the same hall on the Mound. That is until a
decade ago, when a feisty guild president choked a few dog collars with her
feminism by supporting the idea of God as Mother. Although her views were not
those of the majority of guildswomen, in many ways the stramash was a symptom
of a deeper yearning for reform which had been growing in the guild since the
70s.
The top-down structure of a central committee with area councils to which
branches sent representatives, was good at drawing out talented women who were
able to use skills they had withdrawn from the workplace in order to be
homemakers. The trouble was that these leaders were leading an army which had
still to be convinced there was a war to be fought and who were quite content
with traditional ways - symbolised in many kirks by a locked cupboard in which
the cups and saucers bearing the guild crest are locked away, never to be
shared lest they be chipped by careless users.
The guild's breezy general-secretary, Mrs Lorna Paterson, previously a
university administrator, saw the way the wind was blowing. Together with the
national president, Mrs Mary Sherrard, who had been one of the pioneers of
pre-school playgroup schemes, they recruited Mrs Jane Gray, a teacher who
worked in curriculum development, and so began research and development.
Adopting the same techniques (and alas some of the same jargon) as have
accompanied reforms in areas such as health and education, they began the
process which is reaching its conclusion, but not without murmurs of dissent.
``We're finding it painful finding out how painful they're finding it,'' admits
Jane Gray.
Avoiding the mistake their English sisters, the Mothers' Union, had made by
trying to reform themselves from the top down without consultation and
incurring widespread resentment, the guild has been consulting like mad. The
latest process involves a tape/slide presentation on proposed new structures,
which had me nodding off halfway through. However, the trio patiently took time
from a merry-go-round of meetings to explain the import of the changes.
A newsletter will make sure that information goes to all members rather than
the favoured few and will improve channels of communication. Branches will be
encouraged to rely less on a few office-bearers who carry all the organising
load and bring in those who will share tasks on a more temporary basis. This
will enable women to pick 'n' mix the meetings they want to attend and perhaps
organise one on a theme which interests them without being committed to take it
on for the whole year.
``At the moment,'' says Jane Gray, ``task sharing in some branches means that
some ladies make the tea and others pick the hymns. We have something more
fundamental in mind.''
The guild's ``politburo'', the central committee, will become more of a
training forum and the decision making farmed out to area councils who can
organise regional conferences. The big assembly in the spring will be
transferred to September when the energy generated will be carried on into the
winter session instead of seeping away into the ``black hole'' of summer
vacation. Flexibility is the keynote and the reformers have two-thirds in
favour of the changes from about two-thirds of the branches who have replied.
It's hardly a revolution but it runs the danger of disturbing the status quo
and alienating the traditionalists while failing to replace them with new
members.
There is a biblical warning against putting new wine in old wineskins, but Mary
Sherrard's view is that the new wine will go into new structures. ``At the
moment the Woman's Guild occupies a box within the church and if we want to
change that box, then the Church needs to give us a different shaped space.
People may be anxious that these changes will not suit them, but they can adapt
them to their local situation.''
Her own vision of the guild is an interface between Christianity and the world
and they are amply illustrated by the successful annual projects which the
guild has undertaken in recent years.
After-schoolcare, counselling services throughout Scotland, and drug-addicted
prostitutes in Leith have all been areas of work which have benefited from
guild funds. Two guild delegates attended the 1995 Beijing Women's Conference.
The competence of the guild leaders and the relevance of their ideas to the
modern world is not in doubt. The unresolved question is whether their reforms
will be adopted by the 1500 branches. That's where image will meet reality.

ICE HOCKEY
INJURED Murrayfield Royals hit-man Tony Gagliano was last night ruled out of
tonight's derby with high-flying Dumfries Vikings.
The American injured his right knee after being tripped 30 seconds from the end
of Saturday night's 19-1 thumping by Swindon Wildcats.
The marksman will see a specialist early today with his fingers firmly crossed
that there is no permanent damage.
Royals sit second-bottom of the first division after only three league wins in
27 games. Club officials had hoped that the American, who played in the French
elite league last season, would form an exciting partnership with Finnish
newcomer Olli Tarhonen, who has fired five goals in his first two games for the
Scots.
Today's fixtures: Premier Division - Basingstoke v Sheffield (3.0); Cardiff v
Nottingham (3.0). Div 1 - Dumfries v Murrayfield (7.30); Solihull v Guildford
(2.30); Telford v Medway (8.0). Challenge: Scotland Under-14 v Fife Flames
(7.0, at Murrayfield).

CHRISTMAS morning on Scott Road, and I have taken a break from stuffing the
goose. The giblets are boiled to a good stock, for noble gravy; sage and onion
mingle in a brown bowl with breadcrumbs. The goose itself is in disgrace
because half an hour ago, as I rubbed it with sea-salt and clawed lumps of
extraneous fat from its innards, I found the parson's nose quite frozen.
So the goose is now having time out by the boiler, and in a couple of hours I
shall look again and, if there is the slightest doubt, I shall turn her in the
microwave for a while.
A friend rang the other night and asked after my Yuletide indulgences.
``Well, I've only the one present,'' I said, ``gay affair all wrapped in
tartan, from Margaret and Kenny. The folks are keeping mine until I reach town
. . . Rather odd parcel. There's a cylindrical object, too light to be a
bottle, and a big square thing. With my luck, probably a calendar and a tin of
oatcakes.''
CHRISTMAS morning on Scott Road, where I now live; the highest road in Tarbert,
Harris, and where I slept my very first night on Harris, over 10 years ago. It
was July 1985, and I was a student, cycling from Edinburgh to Stornoway. I'd a
tent on the back of the bike, and camped each night on the way up, but the
ferry was very late into Tarbert, and I arrived in thick drizzle and clouds of
midges. After desultory efforts to erect the tent, I abandoned thoughts of
character-forming masochism and squelched off to the Tourist Office.
They sent me to a Mrs Macleod on Scott Road. She was a sweet old lady in a blue
housecoat. The bed was snug, the breakfast delicious, her husband as gracious
as herself.
My office window looks down on that patch where I tried to camp, behind Tobair
Mairi; I now know that it is a little burial ground, where plague-ridden
sailors were buried two centuries ago. No-one has ever built there. But Mrs
Macleod? I cannot remember her first name, nor the house number, and if I have
ever since met her she has not reminded me of that night. If she is still
spared, then seasonal greetings to the Unknown Landlady.
A WHITE Christmas. It is the first one I have ever seen.
I have cards strung up on a string along the mighty stone fireplace, and
seasonal lights strung about the long front window. I don't have a tree,
because we never had one in the manse; evergreens featured in pagan solstice
worship. But, over the past couple of weeks, I have given five trees away. One
of my predecessors planted 170 lodgepole pines and, since my arrival in
October, I have been steadily removing them. Word has spread. John Murdo and
Helen have taken three - two for the hotel, one for the house - and the doctors
turned up at my door on Thursday, with ingratiating smiles and a large chainsaw.
Not everyone here is keen on Christmas.
I was at the manse for my tea on Friday and they were inquiring kindly after
the views from my new house.
``Well, from my kitchen I can see the Harris garage, the West Loch, Soay, the
Glorigs, and the Atlantic horizon. From the guest bedroom there's great views
to Skye and the pier, and from the office I can see the Caw, and the
crossroads, and Scotasay.''
``Your office,'' said the Rev Roddy. ``That's where you have your Christmas
lights.'' And his grin dazzled. The Rev Roddy preached against Christmas and
all its blasphemies the other Sabbath.
``My New Year lights, yes,'' I said. ``Neil, am I going red?''
Anyway, we discussed how shocking Christmas was, and wasn't it a judgment that
the Episcopals were advertising a service of Nine Lessons and Carols at
Borvemor, and the Church of Scotland a Watchnight Service in Tarbert? (I
agreed, yes, terrible innovations, frivolity, and as a result left too
terrified to attend either of them.) But the food was good, Friday night, and
the company delightful.
There has been much mirth in Tarbert by the arrival of an official Christmas
tree from the Comhairle. Normally only Stornoway has one, but this year they
bust the bank and presented shaggy pines to Castlebay, Balivanich, and Tarbert.
Judging by its appearance I think Tarbert had the last one. It stands
lopsidedly by Brownie's newsagent, with one sticky-out branch spoiling the
symmetry.
When Iain Maciver struggled his way up here on Saturday night (it had taken him
two-and-a-half hours to drive the 38 miles from Stornoway) and before he
patiently fixed the latest elementary fault in my new banger, he told me that
this was our second official tree; the first disappeared into thin air within a
day of its arrival. (I hope Santa has been good to Iain; but for him I should
never have come to Harris, and but for him I should not have stayed.)
ON Saturday night it began to snow. It just fell, the stuff, like icing-sugar
dusted from on high, thicker and thicker, ever more insistent. By midnight
there were 4in of the stuff. By Sabbath morning I knew my walk to church would
be epic.  When I went to church at night it was through scenes reminiscent of
War and Peace. The wind screeched from the north, driving further flurries of
snow. It was bitterly cold.
``Church is cancelled,'' said the Rev Norman forlornly, as I passed the Church
of Scotland manse. He had sallied forth in stout clothing to turn away the odd,
brave worshipper. The weather had been so awful, and his congregation so vast
and scattered, that they had felt it too dangerous to continue with the Gaelic
and Watchnight services as planned.
We Free Presbyterians are hardy stock. We did not cancel, though only 16 folk
braved the blizzard. Afterwards I went to Neil and Margaret's for supper, at
Dieraclete, some 20 minutes distant, and insisted on walking home after
worship. But the cold of that wind!
CHRISTMAS on Scott Road. I have opened my present. It is a calendar and a tin
of St Michael All-Butter Scottish Shortbread. Actually, it's a lovely calendar
- all pugs. Every road on Shetland is closed, the A9 north and south of
Inverness is ``not advised''; highways the length and breadth of the Highlands
are blocked, and power is down all over the place. Lewis is ``out'' completely,
save for Stornoway and Point. No doubt Santa made it through, but how many
turkeys may have defrosted in vain?
Christmas in Harris. Are these more flecks of snow in the wind?
I am off to check the goose, and if our power finally collapses here we shall
march out together in search of the Unknown Landlady and a peat-fired Rayburn.

ADVERSE reaction to the sort of Christmas present you receive from a worst
enemy has left Manchester United trailing 10 points behind Newcastle at the top
of the Premiership as the teams prepare to meet at Old Trafford tomorrow
evening.
The fixture computer's seasonal offering to United was a pair of trips to two
of the grounds where they are least loved - Liverpool and Leeds.
Defeats by 2-0 at Anfield and then 3-1 at Elland Road on Sunday meant that Alex
Ferguson's team have taken three points from a possible 15 at a time when
Newcastle's luck is holding and their self-belief is growing.
Outplayed at Liverpool last week, United were second-best for most of Sunday's
game, except when rallying after Gary McAllister's early penalty.
Andy Cole equalised with only his fourth goal of the season but Tony Yeboah's
thrust through the middle and Brian Deane's header left United's challenge at
the top looking weaker than at any time this season.
Even victory tomorrow will not be significant unless it sows serious doubts
among the Newcastle players, who face West Ham and Arsenal in the remainder of
their holiday programme.
A 3-1 win of considerable quality over Nottingham Forest on Saturday was
evidence that Newcastle are looking comfortable again.
A 10-point lead is certainly a luxurious cushion and as their manager, Kevin
Keegan, put it, ``a big psychological advantage''.
Tottenham should have risen to second place for the first time in eight years
but they exasperated their following by conceding two goals at home to Bolton
in the last 15 minutes, allowing the bottom club their first away point.
At least Tottenham (who visit Southampton today) remain the capital's
highest-placed club, Arsenal having gone down to a Robbie Fowler hat trick at
Anfield for the second successive season.
This year, with Steve Bould and Tony Adams suspended, Fowler took it out on
Martin Keown and Andy Linighan, after Ian Wright had put the visitors ahead.
Liverpool now face testing trips to Aston Villa (today) and Chelsea (Saturday).
At the other end of the table, Bolton's brave recovery did not do them as much
good as they would have hoped, largely because Noel Whelan scored his first
goal for Coventry to earn a 2-1 win over Everton.
That put five points between the two bottom clubs, who meet at Bolton on
Saturday.
Ron Atkinson's team, confident when going forward at home but less certain of
themselves away, visit West Ham today, and Bolton have home advantage against
Leeds tomorrow.
Wimbledon, like Bolton, have been earning some gritty draws, only to find that
two of them still do not equal one win.
So, the Dons, despite rallying to prevent Blackburn's first away win, lost
ground to QPR as Kevin Gallen scored the only goal at home to Villa.
Both lowly London clubs have local derbys this morning, Wimbledon at Chelsea
and QPR at Arsenal.
Gavin Peacock won Chelsea's game on Saturday against Manchester City, who have
quickly slipped back into the bottom four despite an earlier improvement.
City also took advantage of hastily introduced Premier League regulations to
include four foreign players; the historic quartet were Rosler and goalkeeper
Immel (Germany), Kinkladze (Georgia), and Ekelund (Denmark).
In an unpredictable first division, one trend beginning to emerge is the
appearance at the top of some of the bigger and better supported clubs, like
Derby, Sunderland, Leicester, and Birmingham.
The experienced Jim Smith certainly has Derby back on the right lines.
Saturday's 3-1 home win over Sunderland, watched by almost 17,000, took them to
the top of the tree, displacing Peter Reid's team.

YOUR paper gave wide coverage to matters concerning Health Care International
on December 22 and sad reading it makes, especially when it is compared with
the sorry and dilapidated state of most hospitals in the West of Scotland.
While the sick and needy wait long and painful weeks and months for admission
to overcrowded Victorian institutions this splendid state-of-the-art new and
expensive hospital lies virtually empty.
I am told it was not built for us locals but for wealthy foreigners, and it
could not be adapted for NHS use as it is comfortable and luxurious, offering
treatment in the privacy of single, private rooms.
In the NHS patients are accustomed to sharing dormitories and toilets, when
they work, and in the mind of the planners patients could not adjust to
Clydebank and may not feel at ease.
Scotland is at the top of every index for bad health, from deaths from drug
abuse to heart disease. Access to HCI could change all that and I invite
Michael Forsyth to give HCI to the people of Scotland as a Christmas and New
Year present and allow us to develop a world-class health service for our
people.

Glasgow, it seems, will always play second fiddle when West End shows reach
Scotland. Frank McGroarty explains why the second city is missing out
AS The Phantom of the Opera takes the Scottish theatre world by storm at the
Edinburgh Playhouse, the city of Glasgow continues to miss out on the
big-budget West End Musicals.
Although all the city's performing theatres and concert halls play host to many
of the world's top artists they still cannot attract the West End block busters
such as Phantom and others, much to the disappointment of top West End producer
Cameron Mackintosh.
``Even though the Playhouse is and continues to be a terrific venue for my
productions,'' he says, ``I am very sad that Glasgow does not have any
large-scale venues to take the major shows such as Phantom, Miss Saigon and
Oliver. It is, of course, the centre of a much larger population base and
historically has housed longer runs of shows than of Edinburgh.''
In days gone by, a trip to see a major West End show was considered to be a
luxury outwith the reach of many people especially north of the Border. Smaller
productions enjoyed and still do successful runs when they tour round the
provincial theatres.
In 1994 a production of Cats ran at the King's Theatre for an extended period
of six weeks playing to packed houses throughout that run. And last year, Five
Guys Named Moe played for a week at the King's as part of a UK tour and was a
hit with the critics as well as the audience. It was during that week more
people saw that show in Glasgow than in any other city on the tour.
Mackintosh who has produced more than 300 shows world-wide does have a soft
spot for Glasgow and would like nothing more than to bring one of his major
productions back to the city where he spent an early part of his career as an
advertising manager during a production of Hair at the Metropole in the early
seventies.
``I am not for a moment suggesting that Glasgow should have all the shows
rather than Edinburgh,'' he says, ``merely that both cities are of major
theatrical importance to Scotland.''
When the Edinburgh Playhouse reopened its doors in 1993 with the musical block
buster Les Miserables, it showed the big-time producers were now willing to
bring their larger shows to a wider audience. However, only the Edinburgh venue
fulfilled the requirements for staging major productions and make it
commercially viable. With more than a 3000 sitting capacity and a stage
comparable with any of the top West End venues, it is regarded as Britain's
biggest theatre.
For a theatre to stage a West End show, it would need a venue with a minimum of
a 2000 seating capacity with a high proportion of ``good view'' seats to be
considered appropriate to stage a Mackintosh production. The SECC and the
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall are the venues that fall well into the seating range
but, despite the fact that they can attract stars such as Pavarrotti and host
shows like the Bolshoi Ballet, they are considered not appropriate for a major
West End production.
A number of the Mackintosh shows continue to tour in reduced versions all
around the country and following last year's success Five Guys Named Moe is
scheduled to return to Glasgow in the spring of 1996. ``Based on the recent
evidence there is certainly a market for the Mackintosh shows in the city,''
says spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council's performing arts, Lesley Booth.
At the moment it is considered unlikely that any of the big musicals will come
to Glasgow but Booth would immediately not rule it out. ``I do not see why it
should not be possible,'' she says. ``When ever the chance of a show becomes
available we will have to look at them on a case-by-case basis.''

WHILE the people from the Scottish League, guardians of the game along with the
SFA, were settling down to attack their turkeys yesterday, the country's
football clubs were trying to cope on their own with the ravages of the
weather. A white Christmas might be good news for the children, but it does
nothing for the game.
Anxious managers and players turned up at their clubs yesterday and looked at
nothing more than white wastelands, yet many of them had difficulty in
contacting the administration. Clubs wanted to warn of possible postponements
and to book referees for inspections, but while they were acting
professionally, others were not.
After a while Falkirk managed to make contact with someone and requested an
inspection yesterday. They took one look at their pitch and knew their game
against Aberdeen could not be played.
Their fears were confirmed after an inspection of the Brockville surface and
the game was postponed. Also concerned about the conditions of their pitches
were Partick Thistle and Raith Rovers, and inspections will be held at their
grounds this morning.
Both those matches, between Raith and Celtic, and Thistle and Hibernian, are
doubtful. But the game between Rangers and Kilmarnock is expected to be played
because the Ibrox club did not spare expense with their undersoil-heating
system.
Hearts have a blanket which covers their pitch, but they might also call for an
inspection today.
``I would rather have played the game against Aberdeen because we had a couple
of new players (Andy Gray and Albert Craig) to bring in, but we had to make a
decision early,'' said Falkirk's manager John Lambie.
``The pitch didn't look good and a morning inspection might have caused
problems for Aberdeen's supporters who have a long way to travel.''
In common with others, Lambie had trouble contacting a referee because the
Scottish League offices were closed yesterday. An emergency number was supplied
- but when some clubs called, they heard a recorded message.
If the Scottish League wish to schedule matches for Boxing Day, then they
should at least make better provision for clubs to deal with any problems
caused by the weather. Snow and ice was forecast last week, which gave the
League ample opportunity to make sure that someone would be available to deal
with requests for inspections or even offer advice.
The administration must have been aware that clubs had called their players in
for training on Christmas Day and would, therefore, be able to take a look at
the playing surfaces. It would have been logical to have had someone standing
by for the calls.
Other matches off:
First division - Clydebank v Dundee.
Third division - Brechin City v Alloa.

SNOW covered most of the unprotected pitches throughout the country on
Christmas Day, but the white blanket couldn't disguise the fact the game is
becoming more like old times by the week. Rangers may not like it, of course,
but Celtic in close pursuit gives the premier-division championship a more
exciting appearance than it has had for some time.
The Ibrox side are completing a satisfactory first half of the premier-division
campaign yet Celtic, whose recovery from troubled times has been both swift and
impressive, remain within touching distance, although a little more daylight
could be opened up between the two after this afternoon's matches.
Rangers, whose game against Kilmarnock today will go ahead, may have an
opportunity to declare again their intentions, because Celtic could be reduced
to spectators as their game against Raith Rovers at Kirkcaldy is doubtful.
Raith's manager Jimmy Nicholl said last night that underneath the snow were to
be found hard, icy patches which he felt could be dangerous. An inspection will
be held this morning although Nicholl is hoping the go-ahead will be given.
Celtic have cut the gap between themselves and Rangers to two points and apart
from a dip in form against Falkirk last week - although Celtic still managed to
win - Burns' players have been performing with style and confidence.
Having had to settle for a draw against Motherwell at Fir Park last midweek
Rangers would be determined to take advantage if Celtic are unable to kick a
ball in earnest this afternoon, because Smith knows the value of being in
possession of points rather than games in hand.
After today's programme Rangers are scheduled to play Hibernian at Ibrox on
Saturday while Celtic take on Hearts at Tynecastle before concentrating fully
on the confrontation at Celtic Park on January 3.
It is a measure of Rangers' desire that even though they have had crippling
injury problems and suspensions they have lost only one league match - Hibs
beat them at Ibrox in September - which clearly proves they remain as resilient
as ever.
``I can't remember reaching the halfway stage with only one defeat,'' said
Smith. ``This must be one of the best starts we have made since I came to the
club, but it is important to keep it up over the holiday period.''
Paul Gascoigne, who, according to Smith, had struck his best form for Rangers
before being interrupted, and Oleg Salenko are available again after
suspension, but Stuart McCall and Ally McCoist will still be mising because of
injuries. Indeed, both could miss the game next weekend and even the Old Firm
encounter.
However, Alex Cleland and Gary Bollan have been added to Rangers' squad and the
manager pointed out: ``This year the league results haven't shown the effects
of our European involvement but playing on a week-to-week basis I hope gives us
the chance to let our injury problems settle down.
``If we can get a run going with a similar team playing together for a number
of games, that would be my New Year's wish.''
Kilmarnock, who are still perilously close to the relegation zone, must try to
take more from their away matches. It was only a matter of weeks ago they were
at Celtic Park and found themselves two goals up yet they still contrived to
lose 4-2.
Clearly, though, they can play when the mood strikes them and manager Alex
Totten points out: ``We have scored five more goals at this stage than last
season, when Colin McKee was top scorer with six goals. This time Tom Brown has
scored that amount and Paul Wright has seven.''
Tom Black and Ray Montgomerie are expected to play at Ibrox. Montgomerie has
been absent for 12 weeks because of a broken nose and Black missed two games
because of tonsillitis.
Peter Grant and John Hughes won't play for Celtic against Raith Rovers because
they are still suspended, but Burns has no injury problems bothering him.
``People might talk about league deciders and such like but the most important
game for us is the first one against Raith,'' he said. ``You get the same three
points for beating them as you do for beating Rangers.''
Burns believes the strength of his squad is improving because of the young
players who are pushing for places in the first team, and he mentioned Stuart
Gray, Chris Hay, and Brian McLaughlin. However, the manager will be careful not
to overplay any of the younger ones.
Celtic have played the Stark's Park side three times so far this season - once
in the Coca-Cola Cup, a tie Celtic won 2-1 - and each time have found them
difficult opponents.
Partick Thistle have protection against the weather, but they, too, have called
for a morning inspection. ``However, I'd have to say that right now our game
againt Hibernian looks doubtful,'' said manager Murdo MacLeod last night.
In return for Albert Craig the Firhill side were given Nicky Henderson, who
will make his debut if the match goes ahead.
The Edinburgh side, already without seven players - O'Neill, Dods, and Evans
who are all suspended, and Mitchell, Miller, Harper, and Farrell, who are
injured - also must rule out Graeme Donald. He broke his jaw in training.
Hearts went to Pittodrie last time out and came away with a 2-1 win, which
should be enough to alert Motherwell to the difficulties they could face today
at Tynecastle, provided the pitch is playable. Dougie Arnott could be back for
Motherwell, but Brian Martin has a hamstring problem.

CRICKET
SRI Lanka have been cleared of charges of ball tampering during the first Test
against Australia in Perth earlier this month.
The International Cricket Council expressed their ``sincere regrets'' to the
Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka and the players and also criticised
the two umpires involved.
Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga said his team's morale has been boosted by
the ICC ruling as they seek to level the three-Test series at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground which starts today.
``It's really good that this has been done,'' Ranatunga said. ``We were very
keen to clear our name.
``Some of the things we heard made it very uncomfortable for us but we knew
that we might get cleared and it's really good news before such an important
match.''
Ranatunga, meanwhile, will undergo a fitness test before start of play today
after missing his side's final practice session because of an injured finger.
Australia will be strengthened by the return from injury of Paul Reiffel and
Steve Waugh.
Shane Warne, who was confined to bed with a virus for several days, is likely
to play after making a marked improvement.
q.FORMER West Indies Test ace Joel Garner has called for current skipper Richie
Richardson to be replaced.
Garner believes fast bowler Courtney Walsh must take over as captain if the
West Indies are to pose a challenge in next year's World Cup in India,
Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
``If he (Richardson) does not perform with the bat on the current tour (of
Australia), he should not go to the World Cup, as he has been a negative
influence on team morale as captain and would likely continue to be so in a
lesser capacity,'' wrote Garner in his weekly newspaper column.
``It is high time for Courtney Walsh to assume his rightful place until he
retires, as he has earned it.''
Walsh led the West Indies to India and New Zealand in late 1994 and early 1995
when doctors ordered Richardson to rest because he was suffering from acute
fatigue syndrome.
Garner took 259 wickets in 58 Tests for the West Indies between 1977 and 1987.
And his comments carry even more weight because he is one of two Barbados
delegates to the West Indies Cricket Board of Control.
Richardson, who has led the West Indies in 24 Tests since succeeding Viv
Richards in 1991, has been under mounting pressure as his batting form has
declined and his team, undermined by internal divisions, have struggled to win
matches.
They have lost all three matches they have played in the World Series
tournament in Australia after the withdrawal of batsman Brian Lara two days
before the team left the Caribbean.
Earlier, they completed a drawn match against an Australian XI in Brisbane.
q.NEW Zealand scored a 32-run victory over Pakistan in Auckland yesterday to
square their four-match one-day series at 2-2.

BORROWERS could be charged more than one million per cent APR for unauthorised
bank loans, the Labour Party claimed yesterday.
As shoppers prepare for the New Year sales, Shadow Consumer Minister Nigel
Griffiths warned against impulse buying and the racking up of unapproved debt.
When daily fees and interest were added up over a month, unsanctioned loans
from banks might cost more than three times as much in APR as agreements with
licensed moneylenders.
The warning follows a survey by Trading Standards officers, backed by Labour,
which looked at 13 types of borrowing.
Cheapest was a credit card loan repaid within the interest-free period -
costing the borrower no interest.
Mail order catalogue buying was also interest-free, but goods might cost more
than shop-bought items, Mr Griffiths said.
Shoppers were also warned against using unlicensed moneylenders, who reach
unsigned agreements. They could harass unsuspecting borrowers and seize social
security and child welfare books if regular payments were not made.
Mr Griffiths said: ``It is vital that people do not give in to impulse buying,
especially if they are paying a high price for credit.
``We need an investigation into the charges which are being levied for credit -
especially the charges of some banks.''

SCOTLAND'S first Christmas baby was born at 17 minutes past midnight.
Chloe Nelson, weighing 6lbs 15oz, was delivered by Caesarean section at
Glasgow's Royal Maternity Hospital, two days after she was due.
Her parents Elaine, 26, and Donald, 24, of Parkhead, Glasgow, chose the name
because it was unusual and could not be shortened. Chloe is their first child.
Mrs Nelson, who works in the Strathclyde social work department, said: ``I am
delighted to have Chloe here safe and sound and having the first Christmas Day
baby is just great.''
Mr Nelson, who was present throughout the birth, said: ``It was hard to
describe it all, it's a whole new experience. I was really nervous beforehand
but now I'm surprised how straightforward it all was.''
Senior midwife Eleanor Stenhouse said Chloe's arrival had been quite an
occasion for staff.
``It looks like it might be our first Christmas Day baby for some time,'' she
said. ``We have had New Year babies before but no-one here can remember any on
Christmas Day.''
Mary Crilley delivered Scotland's second Christmas baby at 12.25am and named
the child Holly. She said she was ``chuffed to bits'' after the birth at Dr
Gray's Hospital, Elgin.
``We actually had another name planned but when she was born on Christmas Day
it had to be something Christmassy,'' she said.
Edinburgh's first Christmas baby, Shannon Hosie, made her appearance at
12.31am, but it will be another 24 hours before she sees her father Paul, who
is a soldier stationed in Northern Ireland.
Shannon, weighing 5lb 6oz, is the second child for Mr Hosie, 27, and his wife
Michelle, 25, from Macmerry in East Lothian. The couple already have a son,
Lee, aged eight.
Mr Hosie, a lance corporal in the Royal Scots, is based near Armagh until
March. He is travelling home today to see his wife and daughter.
Mrs Hosie said: ``I spoke to Paul this morning and he is delighted. Shannon
wasn't actually due until January 29 but Paul was home at the weekend and we
decided on a name.''
One of Shannon's first visitors was Edinburgh's Lord Provost Norman Irons on an
official Christmas visit to the East and Midlothian NHS Trust maternity unit,
Edinburgh.
At Aberdeen Royal Infirmary the first Christmas baby was born at 12.40am to
Janice Riddoch, of Buckie. She called her baby son Kieran.

EDINBURGH Accies skipper Dave McIvor last night refused to condemn Rob
Wainwright for turning his back on the club and opting to join Watsonians.
Wainwright had indicated that he was likely to return to Raeburn Place after
finishing his stint with West Hartlepool but was forced to change his mind when
Accies were relegated.
The Scotland captain made his decision at the weekend and will go to Myreside
with McIvor's full backing and best wishes.
McIvor said: ``Obviously, it is very disappointing, but I don't blame him for
choosing Watsonians ahead of us. After all, he is the Scotland captain and it
will obviously look much better from his point of view if he was playing his
domestic rugby at as high a level as possible.
``He's a real crowd-puller and I'm sure he will be very well looked after at
Myreside.''
McIvor added: ``Even without him, and allowing for the fact that we have been
relegated, Accies still have the best pack of forwards in the country.
``Scott Murray and I were both voted among the top three in newspaper ratings,
and Martin Waite is was joint top try-scorer in the Tennents Premiership.''
Meanwhile, Wainwright's predecessor as national captain, Gavin Hastings, was
among the first to applaud his decision to join Watsonians.
He said: ``We are a very ambitious club and there will be a lot of prestige in
having the current Scotland captain in the side.
``I know it wasn't an easy decision for Rob to make, but I'm convinced he will
make a big difference on the field.''
Wainwright said: ``It was always a two-horse race between Accies and Watsonians
and the fact that Myreside is a lot closer to my home has been significant.
``I also had to consider that Accies have been relegated. I'm sure they will
bounce back, but I don't want to be playing second-division rugby next season.
``I still have a lot of friends there and I wish them luck.''
Wainwright could make his Watsonians debut in the regional league within a
fortnight.
However, he may want to stay with West Hartlepool until their interest in the
Pilkington Cup is over.
He scored two tries on Saturday as they defeated Weston Super Mare 25-9 in a
third-round tie.

AT the first film show the seats were in the dunny of a Paris cafe. In a
continuous programme which will reach its century on the day after tomorrow the
movies have flickered in some other odd venues. Cinema curtains have opened in
just about any old show place.
Pictures were booked into vaudeville theatres. Shops and factories got into the
act. Churches were converted. Shooting galleries and roller-skating rinks were
darkened for the new entertainment.
One of the more severe changes of use occurred in Glasgow. In Tradeston a
former cork works was changed into a dream factory. While the proprietors gave
their palace a glitzy name, its patrons continued to call it the Corky.
Little featured in the centenary celebrations has been how going to the
pictures was often as glamorous as attending a gospel meeting. Much of the time
film nights were about seeing duff shows in crummy halls. Their smell endures
above all. It was a complex aroma of old dust, disinfected linoleum, wet
overcoats, and the distant whiff, sometimes not distant at all, of urine.
In her Pictures Past ((l985) book, Janet McBain, archivist of the Scottish Film
Council, chronicles happy days at the Starry, properly called the Star, a
one-time church hall off the Canongate, Edinburgh.
Bughut cinema history went downhill from the basement of the Grande Cafe, Paris.
It was there that a downstairs audience witnessed a premiere by the brothers
Auguste and Louis Lumiere, who ran the family's Lyons factory that had
concentrated on snapshot cameras and photographic plates. By way of
diversification they put together a moving picture camera they called the
cinematographe.
The Lumiere freres had done the trick of combining animation with projection.
Having patented their work in February, l895, they had their first film show
three days after Christmas l00 years ago.
As centenaries go, the cinema's is an accommodating festival. Scotland need not
catch up on its local nostalgia until the spring.
It was then that the first public film show to paying customers occurred at the
Empire Palace Theatre, Edinburgh. The audience was less than thrilled. Variety
acts before and after the picture went down better.
How Glasgow reacted to taking its first seat in the stalls seems not to be
recorded, except that it was later than Edinburgh's by a few weeks. Glasgow
abundantly caught up.
Its role in cinema's story is central. Glasgow became rated as the
picturegoing-est place in Britain. Perhaps, though, for the number of seats for
local bottoms Saltcoats may have put the city's lights in a peep. Other most
fervent fans were in Campbeltown.
How many cinemas Glasgow has had has become a piece of showbiz arithmetic.
Every good guess is bigger than the previous one. In his survey, Cinema City
(l983), author T Louden put the total at l30 picture-houses.
His devoted little book also records that the city's most popular picture ever
was the Sound of Music. At the Gaumont, Sauchiehall Street, it ran from April
l, l965 for two years and eight months.
At the nether end of Glasgow's enthusiasm was a piece of malarkey entitled Song
of Norway which starred one Trolav Haulstaud. It took a portion of the blame
for the closing of the State, Shettleston, where it failed to last a week.
According to Cinema City, its paybox takings for three days in l974 totalled
#77.
Although Sound of Music has been the city's longest-runner, it fails by several
light years to be the most enduring cinema bill.
At a picture house called the Regal a permanent place in parochial lore is
occupied by The Drum, all about how a garrison of kiltie soldiers kept India
safe from several million Himalayan tribesmen.
With believable hyperbole, this Alexander Korda extravaganza boasts a cast of
3000.
At their head is Sabu, who before he became a film star worked as a stable lad
for elephants in Mysore. Pretty Valerie Hobson is also in the picture. At
moments of danger to the garrison she plays the piano, as cinema ladies often
did at such times.
In the few lines which the script allows her to utter she says darling at the
end of every sentence she addresses to her officer husband (Roger Livesey). His
name is Carruthers. Of course, it is. Outside their sitting room many kilties
heroically are about to be slaughtered by hidden machine guns that have been
positioned with dark cunning by malevolent Raymond Massey.
Coming shortly to the Regal after The Drum will be a Shirley Temple confection
called Little Miss Broadway. It has Jimmy Durante in it. Admission is ninepence
this centenary week and the same next week. At this Regal to get in will be
ninepence forever.
For it is not really a Regal and it is not showing The Drum. It is a phantom
movie show in a ghost movie house in a cobbled street of yore re-created in the
Museum of Transport, Glasgow. The date is l938 when, a museum label asserts,
there were 92 cinemas in the city.
Although the Regal remains, other departed names can only be wept for - the
Playhouse, Inverness; the Commodore, Scotstoun; the Pavilion, Wick; the Viking,
Largs. Paisley had a Palladium. At Charing Cross, Glasgow, the old Norwood had
its canopy topped with a replica of the Forth Railway Bridge . . .
Let that be The End. After even so shortened a list there can hardly be a dry
eye in the house.

SCOTS are ``good'' Europeans - better than the English and Welsh but not yet as
European as our continental neighbours. The typically pro-European Scot will be
aged under 45 and a so-called ABC 1, in other words, better off than most.
A Mori poll conducted for the European Commission and the Anglo-German
Foundation concluded recently that Scots were the most satisfied with the
European Union of all the British ``regions'' and also the least convinced that
EU membership had left them worse off. But the margin of overall approval was
narrow and recent polls for The Herald have suggested that Scotland's love
affair with the EU is cooling, but only marginally.
Even in Scotland there are grave doubts about the desirability of a single
European currency. Almost half (48%) of Scots said they would vote against it
if there was an immediate referendum. But that figure also made the Scots the
least anti-single currency grouping in Britain. Those in favour amounted to 41%
(with 11% don't knows).
Mori concluded that support in Britain for EU membership had declined markedly,
with only one third of Britons believing it to be a ``good thing'' compared
with almost two thirds four years ago. But younger people and the higher social
groups were more pro-Europe than others, with the Scots ``far more supportive''
than others throughout Britain.
One of the oddities of Scottish views of Europe was reflected in our attitude
to the EU's influence on our daily life. Where only one in 20 Germans believed
the EU affected daily life, the figure for Britain was one in seven.
Mori suggested that pro-European sympathies were fired by the perception that
the EU had less influence. One in four saw the EU as ``bad'' and believed it
had a great deal of influence. But those who thought it ``good'' numbered only
one in eight. Scots reportedly felt the EU's impact least despite being among
the principal beneficiaries of its economic aid.
The Mori poll found that British and German people generally still regarded
America as a more reliable ally than their own European neighbours - a
startling response which tends to dismiss the view that the British are
attracted to America only because of the common language.
As usual, the desire for autonomy from Brussels was highest in Britain in
Scotland (40%) - a reflection of domestic Scottish politics. But the British
and the Germans were divided on powers for the European Parliament. Here half
of Britons wanted no more power for Strasbourg, a view taken by only 12% of
Germans. Only three in ten Britons wanted it to have more power - and even that
suggests sympathy for the European Parliament is growing in Britain.

LUDOVIC Ranfurly's portfolio has been running for nearly six years now. It
began as a newspaper series because he asked me to invest #17,000 he received
from a maturing insurance policy.
He had wanted to pay me but in return for letting me tell his story, setting up
the portfolio and managing it with quarterly reports in the paper, I waived
entitlement to any of his cash.
I agreed to conceal his identity and that of Dervorguilla, his wife, who is to
be the eventual beneficiary of his investments. He had married late in life a
woman younger than himself after having cashed in his superannuation monies.
This one policy had survived because, tied to the first mortgage he had taken
out 25 years earlier, its premium was so low as to have, eventually, escaped
his attention!
I hoped that what would happen would provide some harmless entertainment but
also some instruction and encouragement to readers who might also have had
smallish sums of money but were reluctant to invest it because of unfamiliarity
with stock markets or from fear of losing their capital.
His capital was not large - #17,000 is not a lot of money - many new cars are
not very much less - but it is hard to accumulate it out of taxed income. I was
always aware of this, and chose stocks which were meant to be exceptionally
safe.
Ironically it was the safety conferred by its size, and its record, which led
me to choose Sainsbury rather than the smaller William Low when buying a food
retailer for Ludo nearly two years ago. Regular readers of these articles will
remember that I did consider Low, which would have been the better choice. Yet
the safety principle is not invalidated because of one error which, if Ludo is
patient, will correct itself within a few years.
Success in these matters is not guaranteed but it is not just a matter of luck,
for most companies do prosper if at varying rates. Participants need to
establish right away a timescale and the minimum rate of return with which they
are comfortable. They can also decide whether they need to use the dividends or
can re-invest them. He chose the re-investment route because his wife did not
need the money at this stage since she had a job. (Indeed Jilly has always
thought that her husband did not need to deny himself anything to provide for
her: he has thought differently.)
If big companies are chosen they are unlikely to cut their dividends (though it
can happen as Ludo found with BP) and that minimum rate tends to grow. The
timescale is important too because it takes time for an economy, and the
businesses which contribute to it, to grow. Like those who plant trees,
investors have to be patient.

ILLNESS prevented my reporting the mid-summer performance of the portfolio I
run for my friend Ludovic Ranfurly.
At the end of June he had assets in shares, bonds and cash of #46,558.
According to Tilney &amp; Co, his stockbrokers, the comparable total at the end of
his third quarter (September 30) was #49,439, frustratingly just short of the
#50,000 figure which would make a good headline.
He has been building up cash of which he has #3885 at present, but no credit is
taken of any interest earned by this balance which is in a high interest cheque
account with Abbey National. Since he started with #17,000 almost six years
ago, this seems a reasonable outcome.
The portfolio is as tabulated. It is not a representative portfolio, just a
selection of stocks designed to limit the risks inherent in all investment by
backing a range of activities.
The companies involved are large, indeed all are household names, and the one
fixed interest security is an index-linked Government bond which is designed to
keep pace with inflation both in its interest payments and its capital,
provided it is held to redemption. The link in its title is to the Retail Price
Index, the best-known measurement of the cost of living.
As well as secure capital which has every chance of growing (as it has) the
fund provides an increasing flow of income which will eventually be better than
any building society or deposit account. The betterment has already happened -
the income is already slightly more than 10% per annum on the original money,
and the intention is to re-invest this cash although it has been allowed to
accumulate for some time now, hence the near #4000.
During the last quarter the Footsie rose by 5.84% and the more demanding
All-Share Index by 6.79%, while he rose only by 5.38%. That discrepancy is not
large enough to worry me and it is compensated for, to some extent, by the fact
that no account has been taken of the beneficial effect of his cash balance.
Of the companies held only one has proved to be disappointing, Sainsbury's.
Looking at the others, they all seem worth holding though BT always seems to me
to be undervalued - it is under great pressure from the regulator.
I am generally a reluctant seller of the stocks for it is expensive to buy and
sell. And, it is hard to get the timing right. During the past six months
strong sell notices were issued by some brokers for both the Royal Bank and
ScottishPower. I choose to ignore these to Ludo's great benefit in the case of
the bank and at no cost in the case of the utility.
The Royal has gained from much speculation about its attractions to a bidder
but it is doing well enough on its own, and could fund its desired building
society acquisition by the sale of its New England bank at a fine profit. Its
appeal to a predator would not be much dented by threats by the founder of
Direct Line, the Royal's highly-successful insurance company, to go elsewhere.
Direct Line is no longer a one-man band.
In fact the latest interim results, which came after the quarter's end, showed
the bank still firing on all cylinders and suggested that far from considering
a sale of its New England assets it is intent on building them further in
conjunction with the Bank of Ireland's (smaller) presence in the region. If it
goes for a building society, the financing may be novel - or an orthodox rights
issue!
ScottishPower should benefit enormously from the acquisition of Manweb which
was bought cheaply - already the dividend has been raised strongly. BP will
also continue to prosper even if the oil price remains as low as has been
predicted. The dividend will go up, as it will at BT and at the investment
trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial.
In the last company's case dividend rises are nearly always modest, but
relentless, but the case for retention is its large overseas portfolio which
should stand it in good stead were there to be a Labour Government, something
which also applies to BAT, though it also has the attraction of a fast-rising
dividend.
Zeneca too its doing well and I am inclined to think that the bid premium in
the share price is actually much less than many may suppose. It will be held.
So will Sainsbury, though it has turned out to be a bad buy on the capital
front. I thought it had fallen enough to cope with the consequences of the
supermarket war when I bought it; but that was far too optimistic a view.
Possibly too the management has taken its UK supermarket supremacy for granted
and diverted too much attention to DIY (where it also paid too much for the
Texas chain) and abroad (where it nonetheless does very well). Sainsbury should
come all right and it has plenty of cash to raise its dividend above its more
modest profit improvements, but I suspect a long haul is in sight.
His cash holding is always under consideration for investment. It is now close
to what I thought should be the sum which he should put into a share, and I
will commit it in the current quarter in the hope that I avoid choosing another
Sainsbury!

VOLLEYBALL
SU Ragazzi have drawn holders Rucanor Jets in the quarter-finals of the Royal
Bank Scottish Women's Cup.
The Glasgow side only joined the Scottish League at the start of last season
but won the third division at the first attempt.
They are unbeaten and have now moved six points clear at the top of the second
division and the Jets' match will be a test of how far they have progressed.
League champions Bellshill Cardinals have been given a tough tie against
Aberdeen's Coors Hazlehead, who currently lie third in division one but who are
traditionally stronger in the second half of the season and have an impressive
cup pedigree. Draws:
Women: Su Ragazzi v Rucanor Jets; Dundee Patriots v News Ayrshire Kyle; Vol
Hala v Clydevalley; Coors Hazlehead v Bellshill Cardinals.
Men: Team Fife or Kilmarnock v Lenzie or City of Glasgow Ragazzi; Jinty
McGuinty v Bellshill Cardinals; Dundee v 2nd Bellshill Cardinals; Rucanor Jets
v Team Blantyre.
(Ties to be played on January 27).

YOUR leader, Signal for shambles, about the opening series of franchises for
rail privatisation, quite rightly pointed out the dubious nature of the
Government's policy (December 21).
Sir George Young, Minister of Transport, was certainly less than impressive
when trying to explain his new guidelines. He asserted that so-called
competition would bring about benefits for users on the sections of line
concerned whereas in reality there had only been competition of a kind at the
stage when the various consortia had been bidding for the franchises.
They now have the virtual monopoly rights to run whatever service they think
will be profitable for periods of from seven to 10 years, and are apparently
only subject to limited control by the franchising director.
The Government has also managed to play down the substantial amount of public
subsidies the three new groups in England will be receiving.
It is interesting to note that, in the case of the Great Western and the
London, Tilbury, and Southend lines, the heads of these groups admit that there
will have to be job cuts. How this can be done without reducing train services
remains a mystery and the unfortunate train crews - presumably handed over as
part of the franchise - now face an uncertain future.
All this surely doesn't augur well for the future of rail services in Scotland,
bearing in mind that the three franchises just awarded were for sections of
line which were reckoned to be capable of being made profitable.
Perhaps, of course, the Secretary of State, Michael Forsyth, is all ready to
come to the rescue and tell us, for example, what is going to happen to the
rail services in Glasgow and the West of Scotland which depend largely on the
subsidy from Strathclyde Regional Council?

TONY O'Donnell's face was once well kent in the Scottish media. He was a
prominent BBC journalist in Scotland until he was sent to Brussels for the
first direct elections to the European Parliament more than 20 years ago and
stayed on.
O'Donnell is now 47, married with two sons and heads the television news unit
in the European Commission's information directorate in Brussels. He deals
daily with journalists from all over the world. He has strong views on why the
Scots are more European than most.
``It is almost as if there were two states - Scotland and England - in the EU.
The differences are clear. Margaret Thatcher's attitude was to make Britain the
52nd US state and to take us into a deregulated, fast-selling American heaven.
This was so much at odds with the rest of Europe that Britain found at one
point it was make-your-mind-up time.
``The Scots made up their minds. They had always opted out of the Thatcher
model. There was no dilemma, just a determination not to follow her down that
road - and most of Europe took the same view as us. We have been settling a big
score with Thatcher ever since, which is why we continue to gravitate towards
Europe when most of those in the South don't.
``Today there are so many Scots working in Europe. They are the successors to
the Scots who worked in the British Empire. The Scots abroad nowadays are the
Scots in Europe. There is a disproportionate number of them. Take the
membership of the Scottish European Association in Brussels - it is big for the
size of our country even without a separate Scottish presence in Brussels. If
most countries are represented by, say, one in 10 of their people working as
Eurocrats in Brussels, the Scots must be double that in proportion.
``It is the old story of the Scot abroad taking his chance. The Empire is gone
and instead of ending up Rhodesia or Singapore on a map painted red, the Scots
are now in Europe.
``Today Margaret Thatcher is gone but in truth nothing much has changed for
Britain in Europe. The new style is to toss the occasional bone to the right
and left of the party at the expense of a coherent strategy on European Union
membership. There was a golden opportunity after Thatcher to swing the party
back to the inside right, which would have helped them in Europe, but it did
not happen. The Conservative Party is two parties - the moderate Tories who are
really European Christian Democrats and the others who are English
nationalists.
``The Scots will have none of Tory English nationalism. Ours is not a
chauvinistic nationalism like England's. There is no common ground. Scottish
nationalism - and this is where the SNP have got it right - is
internationalism, which is why the Scots are inclined to Europe more than the
English. We don't have the same hang-ups as the English nationalists.''

MANY believe that the reason we cannot get to the truth about the Lockerbie
disaster is because governments have used their intelligence services for
purposes which would horrify most of their electorate were they to become known.
Two recent articles remind us about a certain Syrian terrorist called
Dalkamoni, right-hand man to Syria's Ahmed Jibril, and about America's
willingness to spend CIA money not just on gathering information but on
clandestine interference in the affairs of other States.
Two months before Lockerbie, Dalkamoni and his second-in-command, Gadanfar,
were arrested in (then) West Germany. In the boot of their car was a tape
recorder made into a bomb. The timing mechanism in that bomb was set in motion
by a drop in atmospheric pressure, conditions only to be found in an aircraft
as it attains altitude.
Nor was their arrest a chance event. The German BKA police had had the men
under surveillance for weeks and arrests of 14 other gang members followed
immediately. The German BKA police had copious evidence on video and eyewitness
records of the structure and activities of the entire gang, including their
shopping sprees to buy timers and electronic components. Hardly conventional
stocking-fillers.
Following phone calls from captivity, all were freed within a few days, except
for Dalkamoni and Gadanfar, and they were never charged with conspiring to blow
up an aircraft in flight. Gadanfar was covertly sent back to Syria last year.
Dalkamoni is set to be spirited back to Syria in February 1996.
Meetings with BKA officers in 1989 revealed to us that those involved in the
surveillance and arrests were angry and astonished at the freeing of so many
known terrorists on such a mission. It was not till later that year that the
bulk of the group's weapons and explosives were found by the BKA: the men had
been free and fully equipped for terrorism on December 21, 1988.
Early in 1995 a German-born member of our group wrote again to the German
Ministry of Justice to ask about progress over Lockerbie. She received the
reply that German investigators ``had no knowledge of the passage of explosives
through Frankfurt airport''.
Then again, the link between the careful work of the Scottish police and the
story of Libyan culpability was through identification of a circuit-board
fragment from the wreck as matching a circuit-board photograph provided by an
FBI forensic officer. In 1995 allegations were made against him, by a senior
fellow FBI officer, that he had introduced fabricated evidence in another
high-profile FBI murder case.
When Tam Dalyell, MP, asked in the House what the Government intended to do
about these allegations, he was told that what happens to the FBI officer in
the US is irrelevant to the Lockerbie investigation.
I cannot believe that a criminal court, attempting to try the two accused
Libyans, would take that view.
Scotland's new Lord Advocate, Lord Mackay, must ponder whether his country's
enormous contribution to a genuine search for truth and justice has suffered
nothing less than a hijacking by the politicians of America, Germany, and
Britain for purposes which amount to no less than the perversion of justice.
No-one must doubt that his high office stands four-square for truth and justice.
There is a sombre message for us all, perhaps best summed up in a speech by the
Pope recently: ``Utilitarianism, the doctrine which defines morality not in
terms of what is good, but of what is advantageous, threatens the freedom of
individuals and nations and obstructs the building of a true structure of
freedom''. True freedom ``is not simply the absence of tyranny or oppression''
but is ``fulfilled in man's search for the truth and in man's living for the
truth''.
Whatever the religious persuasion, if any, of the individual reader, there is
great truth and a dire warning here for us all.

ARE you reaching for the indigestion remedies after yesterday's excesses - or
are you so worried by the latest epidemic of food scares that you have adopted
a bread-and-water diet?
These days, it doesn't matter what you eat, or drink, there's a warning
attached.
Actually, the BSE one scared me most. There seemed to be quite a clutch of
neurologists and other medical experts who popped up in the media saying they
had either stopped their children going into McDonald's, Burger King, or other
favourite family Saturday afternoon haunts, or else they had stopped eating
meat altogether.
Now I'm quite sure that every single one of these burger joints complies
absolutely with every health and safety regulation that's going. But I have a
friend who once read a European Commission tome detailing everything that goes
into a burger, and he has never been able to look one in the bun again.
I prefer to know pretty much what ingredients have gone into what I am eating,
and while that is not always possible, if you think you might not like what's
gone into a burger before it has been minced up and mixed up, you are probably
better having a cheese roll. This reaction, however, is not BSE-fear induced -
just an aversion to the thought of what goes into certain fast foods.
Did I say a cheese roll? But it might be listeria-laden. It will certainly be
bursting with fat grammes which the nutritionists say we should be cutting back
on. Better make it a tomato sandwich. Oh no. The tomato might be one of those
genetically engineered ones that Prince Charles was protesting about the other
week. For once, I'm on his side. I can see the argument for certain gene
manipulation to help farmers in the developing world improve their crop yield
in adverse conditions. But do we really need to develop a tomato that takes
longer to rot?
What we need to concentrate on is a return to fruit and vegetables that are
full of flavour, rather than full of water and artificially ripened. So what if
your tomatoes or cucumbers go mushy after X days on display! That's the way
nature designed them. Surely we should be encouraging a fast turn-around of
fresh food, eaten while it is at its best.
So we've agreed. Fruit and vegetables are good for you. As long as they have
not been sprayed by pesticide. Or at least that's what the organic farming
lobby say.
Here, I think, we have got to be sensible. There are probably very few
gardeners who do not use a few chemicals to keep carrot-fly or some other
infestation at bay, at absolutely no risk to anyone. My fear is that some day,
the commercial giants may go too far in producing a cocktail of pesticides in
the eternal pursuit of bigger, better crops.
So what are we left with? Fish? Low-fat tuna, hopefully dolphin-friendly? Good
old cod without the cholesterol-inducing chips? There's an argument against
that too. For more and more conservationists are warning that we are
over-fishing our dwindling fish stocks and, some claim, marine pollution is
producing genetic deformity in some species.
What is a body to eat? An egg omelette? Not if you're very young, very old, or
pregnant. A nice bit of roast chicken? Preferably only if it's free-range. A
glass of mineral water? There was even a report about the other day claiming
that some brands contained unexpectedly high levels of bacteria.
Surely our parents did not worry so much about what they ate. And while
undoubtedly some people suffered from deficiencies in their diet, the vast
majority probably built up a better immunity to bacteria than today's
generation, raised on a diet of EU-regulated unripe brie from the chill counter.
It is hard to resist coming to the conclusion that the media are partly
responsible for turning genuine medical concerns into over-hyped scare stories.
The problem is explaining the complex theories of scientific experts in
language that can be grasped by the lay-person using arguments that do not
distort, exaggerate, or plain contradict the original hypothesis. Many
journalists do this difficult job responsibly. Others go headline-hunting,
uncaring of unfounded fears they create.
The seven-year-old niece of a friend of mine refused to eat meat after hearing
reports on television about BSE fears. Now she has heard another report
claiming that eating meat is OK to do again, so she's happy to go back to
eating burgers.
Two years ago, the same little girl told me she was on a diet. Allowing for the
impressionability of the very young and their natural tendency to copy adult
behaviour, it was still faintly shocking to hear a child so young - a perfectly
normally proportioned child, I should add - worrying about her weight. She had
obviously heard her mum and her mum's friends discussing their calorie intake,
worrying about whether they could afford an extra 50 calories of low-fat
mayonnaise on their salad.
As evidence grows that more and more teenagers, and even girls younger than
that, are developing eating disorders, surely it is time to address our
national obsession with food. By this I do not mean that we should ignore the
excellent advice of health experts advising us to eat more fruit, vegetables,
and complex carbodyrates, and to cut back on sugar and fat. They are merely
telling us to do what is common sense - to develop a proper nutritional
balance. I believe that few would tell us slavishly to stock up on low fat
everything from yoghurt to strawberry jam.
To quote A A Milne's venerable king's plea to his queen: ``All I want is a
little bit of butter on my bread.'' Not 10 slices, just one or two. I just want
less listeria hysteria and a slice of common sense alongside my meat and two
veg today.

BOWLS
SCOTLAND will have a new-look side when they defend the world triples, fours,
and team championship at the women's world bowls championships in Leamington
Spa next year.
Three of the squad who did so well at the last world championships in Ayr in
1992, will be missing - Frances Whyte and Janice Maxwell, both of whom both
dropped, and Senga McCrone, who retired from international play following the
championships.
In come Julie Forrest from Hawick, Blantyre's Betty Forsyth, and Margaret
Letham from Burnbank, Hamilton.
While SWBA secretary Eleanor Allan insists that the playing line-up could well
be changed before Leamington, at this stage Joyce Lindores will play in the
singles, and skip the pairs with Julie Forrest. Margaret Letham, Betty Forsyth,
and Sarah Gourlay are named in the triples, while in the fours it's Letham,
Forrest, Forsyth, and Gourlay.
The big surprise is the omission of Whyte, who at long last looks to have come
to the end of her international career. She can have few complaints after a
string of disappointing performances in the Test series in Israel. Maxwell
seems to be paying the penalty for a string of bad results in the Atlantic Rim
championships, where she was drafted into the singles after an injury to
Gourlay, and a disappointing home international series.
All in, it looks a well balanced squad with a nice blend of youth and
experience. Forrest, 27, has risen through the ranks from junior to full
internationalist and now world-championship player. Team manager will be Jan
McBride, of the Arthurlie club.

SEVEN years ago, Raymond Walters was driving a van for an electrical wholesaler
when he decided that he could do the job himself.
With the help of a partner he invested #10,000 into launching The Electrical
Counter Ltd, electrical wholesalers and distributors in East Kilbride.
The business has since expanded, and has depots in Livingston and Kilmarnock as
well as East Kilbride with another due to open in Clydebank next month.
``Even when I was driving my van I read all the articles and publications
concerning the electricity industry so that I knew what products were
available, and what precisely they did,'' said Mr Walters.
It is this knowledge which he believes is vital, and he reckons that his
existing 28 employees have a wide knowledge of the industry.
``Staff is the secret of my success,'' he said. ``I haven't lost a member of
staff yet. I would like to expand, but I will not do so until I have the right
people.''
Once he has established the new Clydebank depot which is a #150,000 investment,
The Electrical Counter Ltd will be turning its attention to the North of
Scotland and England.
Since the company was launched in 1988, there has been a history of steady
expansion, despite the economic downturn which came soon after it began
operating.
The first premises in East Kilbride took up 2000 sq.ft, but this has since been
expanded to 4000 sq.ft, and Mr Walters would like to add to this space.
``During our first year I ran the depot, and employed a van driver,'' he said,
``Our turnover was #250,000 and by the end of the year we employed four
people.''
By 1990, the company had opened a 4500 sq.ft depot in Livingston new town, and
turnover had risen to #500,000.
Walters was coy about what the present turnover was, because he did not want to
give away too much to his competitors, but said that it is now ``in millions''.
The company expanded through the recession, he said because ``everyone needs
power, everyone needs lamps'' and he carefully chose the sites for his depots.

ENGLAND'S whole South African tour will be made or marred by what happens over
the final two Tests, with only a 48-hour break between the fourth in Port
Elizabeth, which begin today, and the fifth in Cape Town.
``It's all down to 10 days of cricket now,'' said Illingworth. ``We came here
in October to win and there's every incentive for the boys to do just that. At
0-0, the series is there for the taking for whichever side plays best.''
England, having practised for three hours on Christmas morning, named their
anticipated 12, with Jason Gallian replacing injury victim John Crawley, and
Mike Watkinson being added to the team that drew the rain-ruined third Test in
Durban.
Before enjoying an afternoon barbecue, all their batsmen settled down in front
of the television - to watch a video of teenage wrist-spinner Paul Adams taking
nine wickets during England's embarrassing defeat by South Africa A last month.
He will be a threat again at St George's.
But a more obvious menace is fast bowler Allan Donald, who picked up 12 wickets
during South Africa's Test victory over India at St George's three years ago.
Watkinson is likely to be relegated to twelfth man - leaving Gallian to fill
England's problem No.3 spot. ``We are looking for a solid start and if Jason
gets in, he's got good concentration,'' said Illingworth. Teams:
England (from): M A Atherton, captain, A J Stewart, J E R Gallian, G P Thorpe,
G A Hick, R A Smith, R C Russell, D G Cork, P J Martin, R K Illingworth, M C
Ilott, M Watkinson.
South Africa (from): A C Hudson, G Kirsten, W J Cronje, captain, D J Cullinan,
J N Rhodes, J H Kallis, B M McMillan, D J Richardson, S M Pollock, C R
Matthews, A A Donald, P R Adams, N Boje.

MEN are self-stupid, internally ignorant; they go blundering through life,
blinkered, blunt, insulated against the effects of real life, and lying through
their eyes and their back teeth as if there was a gland that secreted
deception, little lie-drops. Men perceive commitment, self-knowledge, and
knowledge of the implications of actions, as murderers; subjective murderers
that men can't point at in a line-up. Ones that suffocate then castrate, before
finally killing. Phew! What an unholy mess.
There is another viewpoint. It says that men are a bunch of chirpy little
runts; rascals one and all. Grinning fools full of merry japes, useless energy
and useless preoccupations. They sleep when they're needed the most, they keep
things simple - they don't like to get all complicated. But they're basically
OK.
And another - although a little less conciliatory - that for all their bravura
and panache, men are inherently afraid of death. They are unable to reproduce
and so they see their lives as meaningless and without continuity.  But because
men refuse to be defeated by death they challenge it in life through reckless
endeavours and self-destructive behaviour.
Different opinions concerning what men are all about seem to litter the
streets; they litter offices and bedrooms and cars, any place in fact where
incidents occur that reveal the fault line where men and women endlessly wear
each other away. It's almost as if an opinion is left behind in the atmosphere
every time; the residue of all the unanswered questions that were asked and
thought about and felt.
And all the questions seem to hinge on one singular axis: what is it that men
are afraid of? But of all the speculations, there is one elemental fear that is
rarely considered: are men simply afraid of the dark?
Goblins and ghouls, daleks and devils and scar-faced men hide, with fiendish
intent, in the wardrobe of all boyhood bedrooms. They are under the bed and
behind the closed curtains too.
As a boy I was terrified of the dark, of its veiled potency, its ability to
subvert comfort and safety and bring about dreadful change. Of course, I was
not alone in this fear, but when the lights go out, when silence seems hideous,
every child who has experienced such a fear feels completely alone.
Looking back, I see now that it was not the darkness before me that I was
afraid of but the darkness inside that it illuminated, and the feelings and
possibilities of occurrence that could exist within it that were not clear cut
and tangible. Nor were those things the scurrilous monsters I imagined, but the
fear of what they could contain; powers that could encroach without
recognisable shape. The unknown things on the other side of the unfinished
moment.
The essential energy of maleness seeks to keep life at arm's length - it likes
things that it can point at and name, things it can mould and assemble.
Consciousness exists, for the most part, within the domain of objects; definite
artefacts. When it comes to foes, boys prefer the type that respond to a punch
or a kick, not the kind that can't be harmed by brute force; the kind that grow
from within.
As I grew older, the offspring of my imagination began to retreat from the
outside world, to hide away inside. Now, in adulthood, I'm quite fond of
night-time and physical darkness. It feels pleasant and gentle - nothing to be
afraid of at all.
Male adolescence means clear distinction of territories: the world of feelings,
instincts, and longings. No place for fears in the big, wide world - so hide
them away, lock them up, and try to keep their loud banging well away from the
outside world. And it's still the same for every boy growing up. Little
distinction can be made between the place inside, where fear of the dark
arises, the place where feelings congest and grow, and where every growing
boy's fear of the ridicule and repercussions of emotional display erects a
make-believe wall.
Whatever people experience requires to be assimilated and correctly filed away
within the realm of existing emotions and experiences. When this fails to take
place then clouds of feeling begin to form; confused and sometimes
overwhelming. The longer that emotions are left to spoil and leak into one
another the more they become like something sick that hides its head and
growls; the darker they become, the less men sense that they can trust what
they feel.
So what is this world like inside? This world that women can experience as a
silent plume of resentment, or as a fist, a shout, or in the language of
infidelity or absence or mental manipulation? An appropriate metaphor is
perhaps one of hooded ghosts moving in and out of consciousness; vaporous and
pained, ticking like spectral bombs, making querulous impressions on the mind
and on actions. Ghosts without the clarity of form that might render them
manageable. Faced with this the body flails and lashes out in the physical
world that it understands - the ghosts explode without diminishing, in fact
they grow larger, they change shape then influence again.
The distinction between the realms of physical activity and emotional change is
a complete illusion. Though men, more often than not, live their lives as if
the distinction is fabulously upheld. This erroneous assumption can be seen
quite starkly in the way that most men engage in sex with women.
Every physical act incurs an emotional response and has an emotional genesis,
but men commit to the sexual act rigorously preoccupied merely with surface and
gesture, as if emotion had nothing to do with it. Everything seems physical;
the act is specific, the mannerisms so self-evident that they can almost be
labelled. Men appear to engage with the female body as if it is a Fisher-Price
toy: round pegs go in round holes, and if they press an area of flesh then a
bell rings.
But even when a man thinks that he has simply notched up another sexual
``conquest'', something else will invariably have taken place deep down - a
ghost will have stirred, stretching in one or more directions, scuffing up the
silt of past experiences, and rousing other ghosts to realign their positions
inside.
While men see the world as something that exists over there, women see it as
something that exists here and now. Women are like little whirlpools of
sensation; pulling in feelings and awareness, facts and fictions into
themselves. Once taken in, the mind and the soul seeks to organise all these
phenomena to obtain a desired effect; the effect that coincides with the wishes
of the imaginary life of each woman. In sensing the physical realm as much as
they see it, objects, and the juxtaposition of objects, can almost be said to
have feelings attached to them. Concurrently, emotions and energies are as
tangible as objects.
A woman's style of communicating with a man will often be a reflection of this.
And this brings the male into direct contact with what he fears: emotions
inside that appear to have no discernible shape, and no apparent meaning within
the world around him - in short, the darkness that is trying to drag him down.
For a man, to encounter the thoughts of a woman can feel a little like being
tapped on the shoulder and when you turn around there is nobody there. Not
because the contact takes place far away, but because it takes place so close:
deep inside, in fact.
As a concept the New Man was doomed from the start. Although it tried to tell
men that it was all right to feel, it didn't tell men that they saw feelings
all wrong; that past experience and inattentiveness had confused their
perceptions. It failed to say that feelings would make them stronger men, and
not weaker ones simply exposed to receiving further wounds. And it didn't state
that these are answers they have to find for themselves, as individual men,
through experimentation and bravery and strength of purpose.
Men still need to learn that the world inside is not one that seeks to rob them
of their virility and their dynamism; it seeks to add to their world and their
place in it. Far from being hooded ghosts, at their heart emotions have a
momentum and a concrete urgency entirely in accord with the world of tangible
artefacts and physical pursuits that men enjoy so much. Feelings inside are
like transparent boxes that overlap so that one can be seen through the other,
and each one contains an energy, a crisp clear light - as definite as a chair
or a table.
Men and women will always connect with the world in different ways, and thus
connect with each other from different perspectives. The removal of male
self-stupidity will not bring this about. But what it can do is to create less
miserable people in miserable, hateful relationships that damn them, and damn
their next generation of men to experience the same misery and carry around the
same ghosts.
The world does not need ``new men'' or ``new women'' of any kind. It just needs
new thinking, new insights into old problems to bring about a new understanding
between men and women. It simply needs a new light on a very old darkness.

STEVE Ferguson is one sportsman who believes in miracles this Christmas.
The Peebles prop, who hit the headlines by cheating death when a tree fell on
him, is on the comeback trail - despite that fact that doctors told him on two
separate occasions that he would never play again.
Ferguson, a lumberjack, thought his career was at an end after a horrific
accident at work almost three years ago.
A tree toppled on him, pinning him to the ground by the lower half of his body.
Inches higher and he would not have survived.
Ferguson defied the odds to bounce back within a year - and even forced his way
into the Scotland squad to tour Argentina.
However, disaster struck again in his first match after the trip.
He recalled: ``I was playing in a pre-season warm-up match against Currie when
my other knee virtually fell to pieces inside.
``My cruciate ligament had snapped - very like what Rangers' Ian Durrant did to
his.''
The medics gave him no chance of getting back on to the rugby field, but,
again, he is about to prove them wrong.
Ferguson had major surgery earlier this year when surgeons rebuilt the
ligament, using grafts from other tendons in his body.
He is back in light training and is aiming to turn out for one of Peebles'
minor sides some time in January.
He said: ``At last, I've got something to be happy about at Christmas.
``Ironically, the knee has been fit enough to play on for a couple of months,
but what has delayed my return has been a series of other niggling injuries.
``Now, I can see light at the end of what seemed like an endless tunnel and I'm
just raring to go.''
He added: ``My target is to get a few minor games under my belt and then maybe
force my way into the first team for the last few weeks of the season.
``If that goes to plan, hopefully, I will be challenging for a place in the
sevens squad for the spring tournaments.

PAUL Theroux has seen more of the world than most people. He's the travel
writer, the one who takes the trains, the one who takes things as he finds
them, if not always entirely uncomplaining. He has been everywhere and he has
written books about it, fine, funny books, telling it like it was, asserting
his own judgment as any travel writer must, as no travel-brochure writer would
ever dare.
``The person who just muttered, `Oh, there he goes again!' must read no
further,'' he declares, in the first paragraph on the first page of his new
book, in defence of his description of some particularly ugly scenery.
But, of course, no such person would have picked up the book in the first
place, one imagines, without knowing the author's reputation. He is a man of
sensitivity, with a fastidious intellectuality, we all know that; indeed his
books sell because they appeal to those who not only like to share his
impressions but suspect that, had they been there, their reactions to the
sights he has seen would perhaps be similar. Or hope, at least, that they would
have been sufficiently discriminating.
So what, then, does he like to do best in all the world, this apparently
footloose American, who has travelled the railroads, lived and worked in
Africa, regarded Britain as his home for much of his adult life and now
announces himself as a resident of Hawaii and Massachusetts?
``My idea of a good time,'' says the globe-trotter, ``is actually to go to
Scotland, take the train up, reading a book and watching the countryside go by
and then the West Highland Line - and after that Sutherland, Cape Wrath,
Ullapool and biking back down the lochs.''
He has, needless to say, done this in his time. He is not the sort of man, you
understand, who goes biking in flat places, like Norfolk or Holland. Just the
other day he biked up to 10,000ft of Hawaii's volcano, got someone to take him
to 14,000ft and then biked down to sea level. It took two days, a short trip,
easy-peasy.
I had suggested to the publicity people that we conducted this interview on the
Deerstalker Express, as a tribute both to the celebrated train traveller and
the fact that the service had been saved for the nation and dedicated train
travellers, but the message had not apparently been conveyed to him. He was
charmed, in principle, by the idea when he heard about it in the fastness of
his Knightsbridge hotel, but it was too late by then: he was in the grip of the
publisher's promotional interview round and trying not to complain.
The true sign of success - John Le Carre, Jeffrey Archer - was not having to do
these interviews, he says. ``Everyone complains about it so I try not to.''
When I express sympathy, he appeals: should he not do interviews like this? He
can't stand whingers. It is dishonest of people to complain about such things,
he thinks.
He once heard Germaine Greer complaining about something like her tax - after
all that she had done and experienced in the 1960s; here she was a scold and a
whiner, he was horrified. He means this. He is a profoundly sincere man.
I found him charming and thoughtful and, not surprisingly, in view of the
reputation he has established in his books, endearingly honest. During our
conversation, he considered ideas, tossed them around, picked them up again
five minutes later. He has a curiosity for ideas, as he does for travel. But he
likes to stay at home, too.
He mentions his sons, 25 and 27, working in television in London and New York,
getting around a lot. And it is in that context that he adds: ``There's a lot
to be said for staying home. I love staying home. You can only write a novel if
you're in one place; there's a certain monotony that helps a novel.''
He has a string of novels to his name, as well as all the travel books, and
that is clearly a product of, well, can one call it a settled life? He split up
from his wife seven years ago, now lives in at least two places when he's not
travelling and still manages to say: ``If I didn't have a settled home life I
wouldn't be able to write.''
He needs contentment and rusticity, can't write in hotels, likes travelling but
likes being at home, too. Travelling for him is necessarily solitary, lonely
even. It is a pleasure, but still he has the solitude with which to deal, the
sense of not being at home. ``Some people might like that; I don't. I like
being home.''
How many times does he have to say this? Is it the relentless restlessness of
the traveller? Perhaps: ``If I was home, I'd want to be here: looking out of
the window and thinking about Albania or Sicily.''
These are countries of the new book, a journey by bus and train and ferry
around the shores of the Mediterranean. It is a delight: informative,
interesting, a lovely medley of literature, his own learning and observation.
He says: ``I like taking a trip and I don't mind writing about it. I guess I'm
politically incorrect, as writers have to be: pointing out differences and
putting robust opinions makes it look as if I wasn't enjoying it. But really I
was, there was a lot to enjoy in the trip.''
But still he was away, abroad, travelling. He goes on: ``I have a sort of
homing instinct but I think: `Let's be sensible here. You have to travel alone
if you're writing' and travelling alone isn't that much fun, but it is very
rewarding.''
Rewarding, yes. He is a very successful man; his efforts have been rewarded. He
is also unusual: he believes in trying to put something back. To explain the
rudiments of this we need to return to the beginning of his career. He wanted
to be a doctor, was a student doctor in the States and an idealist.
``I thought the ideal thing would be to go to Africa as a doctor and really do
something.'' He still does, really, think that the rudimentary things, setting
bones, pulling teeth, is arguably more important than anything else, than
writing: ``You can't write if you can't see or hear or smell.''
He did go to Africa, in the Peace Corps, initially in Malawi for two years in
the sixties, and then in Uganda. He was teaching. He saw life in relief, in
bold relief; he saw figures on the landscape and made the connection between
the way a country was run and the well-being of the people. That can produce a
politician, but it made him a writer. He has been back, too, 25 years later,
and is full of observations about change in society, whether change means
improvement, how to help.
After writing a well-paid article about Malawi for a rich magazine, he offered
to buy books for a school where the library had been ruined, but the headmaster
was suspicious, nervous, worried about misinterpretation - ``and virtually told
me to go to hell''. He understands that. He is the sort of modest, sympathetic
man who would.
``Did you get on with him all right?'' asked the anxious woman from public
relations later. She was relieved when I reassured her. He could be very
difficult, you know, she said. I said I could imagine.

THE public perception of Scottish farming needs to be turned around, according
to George Lyon, one of the three contenders who will be vying to be the next
president of the SNFU at the annual general meeting in Ayr next March.
Speaking at the Stewartry AGM this week, Mr Lyon said: ``Farmers have lost the
trust and respect of the consumer and taxpayer. They are deeply suspicious of
our motives and doubt the integrity of the industry. The big challenge for the
agricultural industry in the coming years is to rebuild our reputation and
respect with the consumer.
``This will not be achieved easily or cheaply and is a long-term project. There
are no quick fixes in restoring our industry's integrity and image. With
farmers enjoying the better returns, we have to invest in rebuilding our image
and reputation. I believe we have an industry to be proud of and for too long
we have been subjected to criticism, ill-informed comment and in some cases
downright lies. It's time we put the record straight. The NFU should be at the
forefront in putting the farmers' case across.''
On a similar theme, Mr David McCreath, the managing director of
Berwick-upon-Tweed grain merchants MSP, is advising farmers to look closely at
the possibility of taking out insurance to cover against claims for
consequential losses.
Mr McCreath spoke of his own business which includes a large oat-milling plant.
He said: ``People have little idea of how careful we have to be in our
manufacturing processes. Quality control is vital, in fact you could say that
the quality controller is the most important person in the plant. If he says we
cannot buy from this or that farm, then no matter what the buyer might say, we
cannot buy.''
Mr McCreath cited the thalidomide case. ``It wasn't the chemists who sold the
drug who were sued, but the manufacturers.'' Without being too alarmist he said
this could happen to a farmer if, for example, glass was found in a food
product and traced back to the farm.
In the red meat sector, even family butchers are becoming increasingly
concerned with traceability. Sandy Crombie, who runs a shop in Edinburgh, said:
``I tell my customers where their beef is coming from, but farm assurance has
to be the right way at the end of the day.''
As Mr Lyon pointed out, this message has still to get through to the silent
majority of farmers who still imagine that their problems are over when their
produce leaves the farm gate. But, as he added, with Scottish farm output
comprising only one per cent of the EU's total, any positive differentiation
should be welcome.

THE Turkish general election has produced a complex and ambiguous result which
may ensure uncertainty for several days, if not weeks. The speedy resignation
of Mrs Ciller, the country's first woman premier, may give a wrong impression
of surety, though she certainly lost. The much-proclaimed victory of the
Islamic party is also a false impression. It is certainly the largest party in
popular support (if only just) but it took little more than a fifth of the vote
and even under the Turks unusual system of Proportional Representation it gets
somewhat less than a third of the parliamentary seats. The real victors would
normally, and clearly, be the centre-right which took more than 40% of the
total vote but contested the election divided into the two groupings it has
fielded for some time. Each got about a fifth of the votes cast. Each has ruled
out a coalition with the Islamicists, but that need not rule out a coalition
between themselves.
The Muslims, the Welfare Party, might actually have expected to have done
better. Turkey is a secular state but its citizens remain overwhelmingly Muslim
(99%). How vital religion was to the outcome needs debating but recent high
rates of inflation were strongly resented as was the success of some privileged
groups in avoiding its consequences. Not all who voted the religious ticket
were motivated by religious concerns alone. That thought might make it possible
for either of the centre-right parties to consider a coalition with the
Islamicists if any element of give and take can be established. That would
involve some eating of words but it would give the religious party a
preliminary degree of political experience without the totality of power
conferred by being in office by themselves - since they are a minority that
would not be an indefensible outcome for their spokesmen to defend, even if it
would rule out the sort of sweeping powers the Iranians are already taking for
granted. The fact is that, by themselves, the Muslims would impose major
changes on the country's main policy positions. Preliminary indications are
that in foreign affairs that would involve quitting Nato and ending the special
relationship already established with the EU - and, by extension, the attempt
to achieve full EU membership. Whatever the pros and cons of such a position
longer term, its immediate consequences are already obvious and unfortunate -
there has been a run on the Turkish currency and a very sharp fall in its stock
market. Neither is a welcome development given the way in which the economy is
within sight of take-off to self-sustainable growth.
A Muslim-moderate coalition is not unthinkable, but a coalition of the two
centre-right parties is probably preferable from a Western point of view; and
the resignation of Mrs Ciller has removed any obstacle to that she might have
represented, though that would not prevent her being drafted back into office
if she turned out to be the preferred candidate of the two parties combined.
Whatever the eventual decision, it is clear from the figures that a religious
government in Ankara is not inevitable and that Ataturk's work has not been
overturned.

O ye, wha are sae guid yoursel'
Sae pious an sae holy . . .
AS we draw near tae the twa-hunnerth anniversary o the daith o Robert Burns,
Scotland's national poet, a man that focht agin the fashionable convention o
his times an championed the uise o his ain native Scots in his warks, there aye
haes tae be some mim-moued, parochial wee linguistic Holy Wullie wi a gripe
anent oor guid Scots tongue.
David S Wilson (December 9), wha ``looks doun wi sneerin scornfu view'' frae
that weel-kent anglophile enclave o Newton Mearns, wad dae weel tae clim doun
frae his pseudo-intellectual high horse, an read Burns's Address tae the Unco
Guid. He micht learn a wee bit aboot humility, an the richt o ither folk tae
defend their leevin heritage o language.
Nae dout, oor unctuous wee freen is a prood Scot, wi a civic pride in the
preservation o his nation's heritage o stately hames an but an bens - deid

nation's history than aa oor tuim castles pit thegither.
He himsel is no blate aboot lettin on he kens some guid big English words:
``maunderings'' = to move or talk aimlessly (from Latin: mendicare = to beg).
Hou mony readers kent that? English haes a great heritage o words frae ither
tongues - but nae mair nor Scots!
It gars me grue tae think that the likes o David Wilson wad hae Scotland's
twa-three million Scots speakers ethnically cleansed o a thousan years o
linguistic history - somethin that three hunner years o the Union haes sae faur
failed tae dae - juist because he disnae hae the brains or gumption tae ken ony

John Hodgert, on the ither haun, as a Scots teacher o English, haes the braidth
o vision tae encompass baith Scots an English - an the richt o Scots speakers
like myself tae be bilingual in baith languages.
Gif I'm no sweirt tae uise my Scots tongue in my professional capacity, whaur
it can help a wheen o folk relax, why shuid ithers be feart tae dae likewise,
in schules or elsewhere, as lang as they learn English as weel - like they dae
in ither lands? We need mair like him, an less o the wee Holy Wullies frae

<HEADLINE>Call for detailed study into how new canal could ease heavy transport congestion #650m plan to create water link</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CALUM MACDONALD</BYLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>974700651</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PLAN to create a #650m canal across the Central Belt has been floated by the
Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland.
The scheme is intended to relieve the level of heavy transport carrying freight
on the area's congested road network, and provide a faster marine link between
the North and Irish Seas.
Although the proposal is to create an expensive new east-west canal, the
institution's initiative could also indirectly support much cheaper plans for
an upgrading of the Forth and Clyde Canal.
An application for #30m of lottery funding to reopen and improve the existing
connection is being made to the Millennium Commission by a group led by the
British Waterways Board.
Mr Harry Osborn, a member of the institution's council, said the plan for a new
link was the result of a two-year study of waterborne transport in Scotland and
the UK.
He said: ``The enormous sums that are being spent on the continual growth of
the road transport sector, particularly on maintenance and the construction of
new roads, is a mounting burden on the economy of the country.
``Growing pollution due to exhaust emissions and the effect on the health of
the nation is also a drain on the economy. Road deaths and injuries add to this
toll.''
Mr Osborn said that, in many countries across Europe and in America, water
links had been maintained as the means of heavy transport, with recent
additions and modernisation.
He cited the Rhine-Main-Danube canal which opened in 1992. In its first year of
operation, the volume of traffic exceeded the forecast for 1997. As a result,
new improvements are being planned to it.
The institution proposes a canal running from the River Clyde near the Erskine
Bridge, to the Firth of Forth near the Kincardine bridge, with open stretches
and sea locks at either end.
Most of the route would be contained in a tunnel, measuring 20 metres wide and
18 metres high, passing through the Kilsyth hills between Milngavie and Denny.
Mr Osborn said the proposed scheme would mean least intrusion on existing land
and transport infrastructure, and would be environmentally acceptable.
In addition, shafts into the canal would help provide flood relief in the
valleys of the rivers Kelvin and Carron.
Rock excavated from the tunnel could be stockpiled as a valuable source for
building work, along with coal from an open-cast site on the proposed route.
The scheme, he added, would also provide employment during the construction of
the canal, and when it came into operation.
Mr Osborn said: ``We consider that, in view of the envisaged growth in
waterborne transport in the next century, this proposal is worthy of further
detailed study, including consideration into methods of funding.
``Such a study should include the economic benefits in a national and European
context, together with all environmental aspects. The institution also believes
that this project could be a significant contribution to the future of the
Scottish economy.''

AC Milan's Liberian striker George Weah won the prestigious Golden Ball award
in Paris yesterday as Europe's top player.
Weah played for Monaco and Paris St Germain before moving to Italy, where he is
leading Milan's charge for the Serie A title. ``It's a question of African
pride. I'm delighted to be the first African to win,'' he said.
This is the first year non-European players have been eligible for the award
given by the magazine France Football in a poll of top European soccer writers.
He was ahead of Jurgen Klinsmann and Finland's Jari Litmanen.
He's actually the second African player to take the award as Mozambique-born
Eusebio won in 1965 as a Portuguese national.

IF THERE'S one thing that demonstrates the popular potential of live
performance it's street theatre. I'm thinking of the noisy, brash, rude
spectacular that Els Comediants brought to the Edinburgh Festival in 1989, the
kind of performance that was both accessible (no grandiose theatre building to
divide audience and performer) and dangerous (if you didn't get out of the way
. . . well, look, you just did get out of the way).
Or then there was the thrilling and frightening show I stumbled across in
Barcelona a few years ago that proved to me that those Catalans really know how
to kick up a racket. Into a tightly packed town square to the relentless
drumming of a percussion orchestra, huge dragons emerged spurting fireworks at
the foolhardy crowd - the more foolhardy not running away (the sane option) but
charging headlong towards the pyrotechnical beasts.
The French are good at this sort of stuff too, though they tend to plump for
structured narratives and elaborate stunts rather than put their audiences in
mortal danger. That's one of the reasons you're more likely to see French
street theatre in Scotland than Spain - it's simply far more likely to get the
thumbs up from Britain's eminently sensible safety officers.
I remember last Hogmanay trailing behind one such show, Exploration - A Voyage
of Discovery, performed by the Marseilles-based company Karnavires. As it drew
us up the Royal Mile and down the Mound, it generated a warm, open and happy
atmosphere - the kind of mood you rarely get in the austere surrounds of a
conventional theatre.
At Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations later this week, street entertainment will
once again be a crucial component in generating the five-day street party
atmosphere that the city has so successfully created since it decided there
might be more to New Year than boisterous glass-smashing and indiscriminate
snogging in front of the Tron Kirk.
From the start of festivities on Friday through to the bells on Sunday, the
city centre will be the stage for any number of performers, bringing free
entertainment to wandering revellers, from the pulsating rhythms of the
60-strong Cardiff Samba School (plus assorted stilt-walkers) to the chameleon
tableaux of Urgence Enfer (who like to strip naked, climb up the nearest facade
and blend in with the statues).
The theatrical highlight of all this is expected to be the return of
Plasticiens Volants, last seen blocking the High Street during Edinburgh's
Summit in the City mini-festival.
On the strength of the company's promotional video, which I saw last week, the
show, Ezili - The Mother of all Monsters, will be a real treat.
Ezili is a massive quadruple-breasted inflatable monster (initially blown up
out of the audience's sight behind the back of St Giles') whose aim is to reach
her nest and lay her eggs. Simple enough for a creature that size, you might
think, but Plasticiens Volants, a company of actors whose preferred mode of
dress incorporates step-ladders, stilts and mohicans, see to it that along the
way poor Ezili has to do battle with an exploding television, a giant spider
complete with outsize web and an inflatable ocean.
When finally she does reach her nest - towering six metres above Waverley
Market - the show careers to a noisy climax with fireworks and exploding helium
balloons.
Doing the rounds at 7pm on Saturday and 9pm on Hogmanay itself, the show has
been programmed consciously to draw crowds away from the old Tron Kirk haunt
and down towards the happier vibes of Princes Street.
``What we try and do is have performers on the street but also popping into
other events like the Hogmanay Ball and the Torchlit Procession,'' says Jeannie
Cranfield, organiser of the street performances for Unique Events.
``During the Plasticiens show there isn't really any other focus of street
stuff, and once their show finishes it then goes into lots of other things
happening. It's all co-ordinated so we have an even spread. Certainly on
Hogmanay night we want to cover as much of the area as possible.''
With ambitions to extend the festival to incorporate the whole of George Street
for the 96/97 shebang, the organisers are fully justified in believing that
public subsidy of the event deserves to be increased.
Few cultural events could claim to have anything like the popular reach of the
five-day party, which is banking on attracting 250,000 visitors on Hogmanay
night alone, following last year's estimated 150,000 and the 70,000 who turned
up the year before.
Another visual treat will be the hot air balloons, stationed in Princes Street
Gardens and floating to a height of 70ft, which will turn up the heat as night
falls and will be seen to glow in the dark.
``The atmosphere in Princes Street is quite extraordinary,'' says Cranfield,
thinking back to last year. ``I had tears in my eyes at one point. It's just
stunning. The atmosphere of thousands of people erupting at midnight. The
fireworks are stupendous, they go up from all corners, from the Gardens, from
the top of the Balmoral, from a crane at the other end of Princes Street - the
idea is to light up the backbone of Edinburgh.''

FOR a people famous for quarreling with themselves the Scots are surprisingly
harmonious about Europe: unlike our southern neighbours we like the idea of
Europe, and most of us want to be closer to it.
It was not always the case. Scotland produced the only two UK areas - in the
Western Isles and Shetland - where the people voted No in 1975 to joining what
we used to call the Common Market. But two decades later, as Europe is being
rapidly politicised - to the dismay and alarm of many of the English - we Scots
seem to be warming to what we now call the European Union and its explicit
objective of ``ever-closer union''.
Around the time of the European referendum, when the Scots voted 2-1 to join
up, Europe was simply a club for capitalists. It was also non-political, except
in the broadest sense of being the plaything of business and commerce. All that
is now changing as the process begun at Maastricht and due for review next year
brings a stronger political dimension which some would call a logical and
indispensable cohesiveness.
Jacques Delors called it the ``humanising'' of the otherwise soulless European
economic integration process. Is it just a coincidence that Scottish attitudes
have warmed to the EU at this time, just as English disenchantment has grown? I
believe there is more to it.
Much of it has to do with the old Scottish trait of seeking a distinctive
identity which is not swamped by English culture; a will to be different and to
be seen to be different. Political scientists are not much help because this is
an imprecise area: but we all know it to be generally true. The evidence is
inescapable and shows itself in many little but significant trends of recent
times.
In the new Scotland it is becoming de rigeur to wear the kilt at weddings; the
saltire is more and more waved at rugby and football matches and flown on
buildings where once the rampant lion or the Union Flag had command; BBC
Scotland is now insistently the ``national'' network where once its controller
was fired for seeking harmless devolution; God Save the Queen is seldom heard
as a new anthem is adopted; the ceilidh is popular again; and the Home Rule
debate is back in full swing. In politics, the most unionist of the parties is
the most unpopular. In my three years in Europe nothing has struck me more
starkly about the Scots' will to be European - and our wish to be seen to be
European - than our hosting of the Edinburgh summit. It was marked by a huge
effort, quite unprecedented in any of Europe's ``real'' capitals, involving
concerts, debates, dinners, celebrations, lectures and a national preoccupation
that ``everything must be right'' for such an honour.
Scotland's political switch over the years from the Tories, who once held a
popular majority, to Labour and SNP has nudged the process along. When the
Scots voted to be Europeans they did so when Labour was divided on Europe and
they did so on the advice of the Conservative Establishment when the Europhile
Edward Heath was in Opposition.
Nowadays the Tory vote in Scotland is down to core level and Labour, perceived
to be much keener on Europe than the Tories of the Thatcher/Major years, holds
sway. A nervous Labour Party in Scotland is, in turn, nudged along as ever by
the SNP with its vision of independence in Europe which has shown itself
increasingly seductive to voters in recent elections and polls.
For the first time there are signs the business establishment - traditionally
indistinguishable from the Conservative Party - is wearying of the political
debate and coming to the view that the world has changed forever. Scottish
businessmen, aware of the crucial importance of Europe, have become more
amenable to it. They are, for example, mostly at odds with the Tories about the
single currency, many seeing it as a useful business advantage. They remain
untroubled by right-wing mutterings about lost British sovereignty.
A recent study by the Scottish Council noted Scottish industry had a ``good and
positive'' attitude to doing business in Europe and was now making increasing
efforts to make their key staff and sales literature multilingual. Anyone who
uses the Eurostar or British-run cross-Channel ferries knows the English
experience where even the tiniest concession to French or German is grudged.
Business will continue to warm to Europe as industry votes with its wallet.
Scottish exports once sold mainly to America, but that changed in the 1980s as
the then West Germany and France became our best customers. A decade ago the
then EEC was taking almost 60% of Scottish exports; now the figure is only
slightly smaller but still well over half. And that, remember, takes account of
the wipe-out of Scottish heavy industry in the ruinous 1980s.
Businessmen are also coming to exploit the image of Scotland in Europe,
equating the image of Scotland with quality. Which takes us to the
distinctiveness of Scotland in a Europe where regionalism is the watchword in a
continent becoming supposedly more homogeneous. Scotland, being a nation, is
touchy about being a ``region'' to the Eurocrats but so are other areas such as
Catalonia or Bavaria.
Such local sensitivities were explored in a survey by Scottish Enterprise and
showed that Scotland was widely seen in Europe as a region rather than a
country, but still a distinctive place.
Unfortunately, the Spanish were typical of most Europeans and saw Scotland
simply as the Highlands where sheep farming was the main industry. They also
saw Scots as small, bearded, heavy drinkers who gave visitors a warm welcome
but were mean with their money.
This stereotyping is probably worse than it sounds. Most Europeans see each
other in stereotypes. What was worrying but familiar was that most Europeans
surveyed used Britain and England interchangeably.
The survey concluded: ``The strengthening of bonds with Europe over the next
few years is a major opportunity to Scotland. Establishing itself as an
economic power in its own right within the community is potentially feasible
but only if the question of Scotland's image and identity as a country is
addressed.''
It also found no real negative feelings about Scotland but a great deal of
ignorance, especially about what Scotland's businessmen could offer Europe.
Scotland was seen as a ``green, clean and healthy'' land but when it came to
detail Europeans were decidedly vague.
``There is a real danger of Scotland's identity being submerged with the rest
of the UK and being treated as a `region' of England,'' the survey concluded.
``Strong promotion of Scotland's image and identity are needed.'' It called for
a more realistic portrait of Scotland, dispelling myths of insularity and
negativity to Europe.
All of which is fine and helpful, except that the remedy lies not in Europe but
at home in Scotland. Some progress has been made now that big business is
accepting arguments advanced for years by some politicians and commentators.
Scots are taking this process further and in particular looking for guidance to
the other small nations of Europe, in and out of the EU. Finland is the
European nation which most resembles Scotland in economics and population - and
far outdoes Scotland in remoteness. Its Nordic partner, Norway, is another
where the voters, among the most economically secure in the world, saw no
pressing need to join the EU, preferring to live off oil and fish.
In the European democracies the strongest economies belong to the small
nations. Scots know this is a chiel which winna ding, though Scottish unionists
are reluctant to admit it. The time is passing when centralists could sweep
aside arguments for devolution or independence simply by pointing out
Scotland's imaginary economic dependence on England.
After all, if Scotland is so bereft and dependent and stuffed with litigants
and whingers, why go to the bother of keeping it? This fact is not lost on
Scots who survey the new Europe in which almost all of the new Eastern
democracies are smallish nations with economies which count for nothing
compared with Scotland's - and the Europe in which the Swedes, Finns,
Luxembourgers, Danes and Belgians are all much better off, with the Irish
catching up fast.
It might still be the stuff of the chattering classes but it exists and it is
changing attitudes before our eyes. As the European Union has become newly
meaningful to Scotland, so Scotland has allowed the weakening of the Treaty of
Union, an apparatus fit for an earlier age when the nation state was the model
and federalism was merely an American experiment.
The next milestone in the Scots' advance on Europe will be a parliament in
Edinburgh (which assumes a decisive break from Conservative if not unionist
rule in Scotland). Even if Labour's parliament turns out to be a super county
council it will, we are assured, give Scotland a stronger presence than ever
before in Brussels.
Whatever happens, it will be the summit of Tam Dalyell's slippery slope. We all
know it, those for it and those against it. As the Scots slither towards
greater self-determination, shaking loose the bricks of the crumbling nation
state, there is only one direction in which they can move - towards Europe.
Europe cost Margaret Thatcher her premiership, almost did the same for John
Major, and has brought the Conservative Party to the brink of permanent
division. As a General Election looms - possibly within a year - the campaign
is certain to have Europe at its centre. In Scotland, the European issue will
be especially important at a time when the home rule debate is, according to
the strongly pro-European SNP, running on nationalist petrol. European Editor
MURRAY RITCHIE examines Scots attitudes to Europe and how they differ from
those of the more Eurosceptic English, and reports on some European images of
Scotland

DUNDEE United's Robbie Winters would love to repeat his Boxing Day magic - only
this time help land the knock-out punch at Tannadice.
Former manager Ivan Golac made the youngster's Christmas dream come true
exactly a year ago when he handed him a debut start against Kilmarnock. He
scored a spectacular goal in a 2-2 draw with the Rugby Parkers, but it all went
sour for Winters later in the season when he could not claim a regular place -
and United plunged out of the premier division.
A year later, though, and with Billy Kirkwood in charge after Golac's
departure, Winters admits: ``I am probably the only man at Tannadice who
actually gained from dropping down a division.
``We changed our style and that has allowed me to play wide instead of through
the middle. That is the role I prefer, even though it means I have to do a lot
more running.
``I've never seen this as a problem because my fitness and stamina have always
been good.
``The one thing I would still like to improve is my goal scoring. I remember
that goal against Killie and I know I should be trying to get in the box more
often for scoring attempts.
``It would be good if I could repeat my Boxing Day goal against Hamilton this
year.''
Winters has clearly gained confidence from the faith new manager Billy Kirkwood
has put in him - and that is hardly a surprise considering United have stuck by
him despite bringing in 11 senior players in a major shake-up.
Now Kirkie, who could so easily have dumped the youngster in the upheaval, is
touting him for Scotland under-21 honours, and the winger says: ``It is very
flattering and it is certainly an incentive to go on producing the goods for
United.
``There are a lot of good players ahead of me with the under-21 championship
quarter-final coming up but at least being in the first division is no bar on
my chances.
``After all, Christian Dailly and Steven Pressley have kept their places and
Jim Hamilton and Neil McCann with Dundee also have been involved.''
United will face Hamilton minus former Aberdeen midfielder Ray McKinnon, still
fighting back to fitness from an ankle injury.
But former Celtic midfield man Jamie McQuilken has shaken off a knee problem
and is in the squad of 17.
Hamilton go to Tannadice with major injury and suspension worries, but Kirkwood
insists: ``As far as I am concerned that will only make our task more awkward
because the players coming into their team will want to impress.
``This is a difficult time because you never know if players have slipped into
party-mode. But we have tried to guard against this by training hard over the
last few days.''
United were able to work out on the Tannadice pitch yesterday thanks to
undersoil heating, and there are no problems with the game.
Approach roads have been well salted and the groundstaff are standing by to
clear the entrances to the stadium this morning.

INDOOR hockey may be regarded as a young person's sport but you would not think
so judging from the Scottish squad for the annual Arminen tournament in Vienna
from January 5 to 7, for half the 12-strong squad are aged 30 or over.
Alarmingly, this reflects the lack of investment, not just by the Scottish
Hockey Union but also by the clubs, in the women's indoor game over the past
decade.
The country's three leading exponents, Edinburgh Ladies, Western Klick
Photopoint, and Bonagrass Grove, have clearly been putting individual success
before the development of youth in their first teams, even if they do provide
the three uncapped players in the party.
Edinburgh Ladies' Linda McLean and Susan Gilmour get the chance to establish
themselves in the side for the finals of the European Nations Cup to be staged
in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall from January 26 to 28, as does Grove's bright young
star, Nikki Kleppang.
It seems unlikely that coach Andrew Scoular will make any changes at this late
stage in the build-up, but if he does, it would surely be to bring in Sharon
Bissett, of Edinburgh Ladies, for her absence is difficult to fathom. She has
been the most impressive forward on view in this season's league and is the
country's leading scorer. Squad:
Tracey Robb, Wendy Fraser, Marjory Coutts, Ellen Murray, Ann Menzies, and Susan
MacDonald (all Western Klick Photopoint), Linda McLean, Diane Renilson, Janet
Jack, Susan Gilmour and Elaine Cooper (all Edinburgh Ladies), and Nikki
Kleppang (Bonagrass Grove). Reserves - Sue Lawrie, Fiona MacInness, Carrie
Corcoran, and Sharon Bissett (all Edinburgh Ladies), Morag McLeod (Hyndland),
and Alison Denholm (Western Klick Photopoint).

SEVERAL high-class chasers line up for the King George VI today, but One Man
looks the one they have to beat. This game grey is the most exciting National
Hunt horse in training at the stable with the best strike rate of the season.
Last time out he came home on the bridle never troubled by Monsieur Le Cure in
second place.
Gordon Richards appears to have cured One Man of the jumping errors that
stopped him in two of his runs last season, and today he can add to his
impressive tally of nine wins out of 10 completed steeplechases.
Merry Gale looks the biggest danger and on a tenuous line through Monsieur Le
Cure may give One Man a run for his money. However, the each-way value must be
Val D'Alene who won the Racing Post Chase over course and distance and
available at working man's odds.
The key to the Tripleprint Chase is defined as the novice horse that jumps best
and Major Summit fits the bill.
He has won both his chases, at Newbury and Towcester, and gives every sign that
he will stay this trip. Much is expected of Feel The Power, but it is worrying
that such a large horse has been off the course for so long.
Cheryl's Lad looks like setting off favourite for the Bonusprint Hurdle after
two impressive wins, but faces the difficult double of a step-up in class and
in weight. It may pay to oppose him and I will have a punt on Bookcase who
gamely held Keep Me In Mind at Exeter (pair well clear) and before that was
placed in the William Hill Hurdle, the form of which is working out well.
If One Man does go to Kempton rather than Wetherby, where he is also entered,
that would leave Young Hustler with an excellent chance of landing the Rowland
Meryck Chase at the northern venue.
The spring-heeled chestnut is a course and distance winner and looked at the
peak of his form in November when running away from his field at Aintree.
He is just preferred to Scotton Banks who is clearly on the upgrade.
The soundest bet of the card at Wincanton looks like Gales Cavalier after two
creditable defeats gving away weight to smart rivals. The extra trip should
suit him and end David Gandolfo's duck for the season.
q DANOLI has been reinstated as 6-1 third favourite in William Hill's betting
for the 1996 Smurfit Champion Hurdle following the his successful gallop on
Saturday. William Hill bet 11-4 Alderbrook, 9-2 Montelado, 6-1 Danoli, 7-1
Atours, 10-1 bar.

COLIN Gillies, who many consider to have what it takes to make the grade on the
European Tour, is instead staying at home for at least another year convinced
that his relatively humdrum life in Scotland beats the hassle of the journeyman
pro's lot.
If it seems puzzling that a player who has been a consistently shining light in
Scotland over the last few years is not attracted to the prospect of greater
riches and the challenge of moving up a level to compete against the world's
best, then a brief chat with the level-headed 29-year-old might leave you
wondering the converse; why do so many keep going back?
``I enjoy my life in Scotland,'' explained Gillies, whose last attempt to win
his tour card was four years ago. ``I am getting married in March, I have a
good job as teaching professional at Falkirk Golf Club, and I have just bought
a house in Falkirk. I don't regard tournament golf as life or death like I used
to when I was younger and nowadays I like to know how much I am going to make
at the end of the week.
``How I play on the Tartan Tour does, of course, have a bearing on that, but if
I play badly in a pro-am it is going to cost me a caddie fee and a round of
drinks. (He has his petrol paid by car dealer Danny Divers). If I did that in
Europe the loss would be about #1500.
``I don't want to be one of these guys who has to face a six-foot putt every
Friday to make the halfway cut.''
Gillies was a noteable absentee at last month's final qualifying school. Even
though he has failed there in the past, few doubt he now has the ability and
maturity to succeed.
At Dalmahoy this year, he did, after all, withstand challenges from the likes
of tour regulars Andrew Coltart, Andrew Oldcorn, and Adam Hunter to win the
Scottish Professional championship, going on to finish No.4 on the Tartan Tour
and top money-earner with #28,265.
Set against the phenomenal earnings of Montgomerie, Torrance et al that might
seem small beer, but when you add up the expenses on tour and potential loss of
earnings at home, he would need to finish, perhaps, in the top 50 in Europe
just to stay where he is. That's a sobering thought when you look at the class
of player these days who is struggling to stay in the top 120.
There is also the certainty by playing in Scotland that he is going to make it
home every night, a real comfort when compared to the harsher
airport-hotel-golf course routine on tour. Such a lifestyle is never going to
quell adventurous young spirits like 1996 rookies Stephen Gallacher and Raymond
Russell, but when you've seen it all before it is not difficult to understand
how the attraction dims.
Gillies, a former Scottish Boys' champion, has been to tour school frequently
enough to be uncertain precisely how often - six or seven times he thinks - and
won a number of category 14 cards which allowed him access to early-season
European Tour events.
Yet you cannot rule out a return. ``I have never said I won't go back,'' he
said. ``It is like gambling. You only bet as much as you can afford to lose.''
Meantime, he is restarting work shortly after the festive break with coach Ian
Collins to iron out a weight-transfer flaw which has tended to cause a shot to
the right under pressure, a real irritation for a player renowned for
consistency and an inspired putting touch.
He has two big targets for 1996. One is the defence of his Scottish
Professional title at Dalmahoy - ``There promises to be a lot of big names
there and prize-money is up again, so I'm looking forward to that'' - the other
is the prospect of his first PGA Cup place in the biennial match against
American club pros at Gleneagles from August 30 to September 1.
Having finished joint second in the British Club Professionals' championship at
West Hill, Surrey, last year, he is one of the front-runners for the team which
will be decided after this year's tournament in Ireland.
That's enough to keep the competitive juices flowing even without the European
Tour.

Somehow `tut tut' or `oh dear' or`dash it' do not ring true as the sort of
genuine response to misfortune
FORTUNATELY and, by the conventions of this day and age, fairly, Colin
Montgomerie's verbal pyrotechnics during the Johnnie Walker World Championship
in Jamaica did not cost him the award of European Golfer of the Year. Given the
common currency of four-letter words in television plays, Crippen himself might
have been declared innocent.
That one single slip of the tongue, offensive to some spectators though it may
have been, did not deserve to discount Montgomerie's achievement in being
leading money-winner for a third consecutive season and, in the first year
since 1986 that a European did not gain a major championship, the only one
among his peers to come close.
In the aftermath of his disappointment at losing the US PGA title to a cruelly
long putt at the first hole of his play-off with Steve Elkington, Montgomerie
was generous in defeat. That he probably would rather have let out an oath or
two is neither here nor there.
Anyway, since golf, to the greater profit and length of competitive life of its
professional participants, is neither a physically combative game nor is played
out in the cauldron atmosphere of a football or rugby arena, the incidence of
an expletive being audible is as likely as its perpetration seems shocking.
A safety valve is surely a legitimate solace after the foozled shot or the
missed short putt. Somehow, ``tut tut'' or ``oh dear'', or ``dash it'' do not
ring true as the sort of genuine response to misfortune - unless by the ``unco'
guid''. A measured, if pungent, reaction is perfectly acceptable.
Needless to say, the great P G Wodehouse had the answer for those too quick to
take offence. In his short story Chester Forgets Himself, Wodehouse had that
most dreaded of golf club bores, The Oldest Member, put the matter in its
proper perspective.
``I am firmly convinced,'' he said, ``that to refrain entirely from oaths
during a round is almost equivalent to giving away three shots. There are
certain occasions when an oath seems to be so imperatively demanded that the
strain of keeping it in must inevitably diminish the steadiness of the swing.''
Chester, you see, in the process of trying to win the hand of a fair lady and
simultaneously break his course's record, was so obstructed by the Wrecking
Crew - First Gravedigger, the Man With The Hoe, Old Father Time, and Consul,
the Almost Human - that restraint collapses under a barrage of blistering verbs
and nouns.
Needless to say, Chester accomplishes both objectives. Felicia, who likes a man
to express his thoughts and emotions, however embittered they may be, is
instantly won over by this seismic outburst. Of course Chester also breaks that
record, holing out ``with a light flick of his mashie-niblick.''
Oddly, the PGA European Tour being the enclosed society it is, Montgomerie's
fine of #100 was discovered not by its own disclosure but by a media inquiry to
John Paramor, the tournament director at Tryall, if any action had been taken.
Imagine the same approach to crime and punishment in football, rugby, or
cricket.
Montgomerie's paradox is of the player driven by ambition but despite almost
unbroken success haunted by self-doubt. Yet the 32-year-old Glasgow-born
golfer's character is, in normal circumstances, totally rational. He has an
astute golfing mind and articulates his thoughts on the game with uncommon
lucidity, if not always logicality.
His view: ``It's outrageous if it's true,'' of Greg Norman's alleged #225,000
appearance fee to play in the Irish Open and that the condition of the
fifteenth green at the 1994 Masters tournament trod the borderline between
``hard and fair'', represented fair comment. That all 12 European Ryder Cup
team places should be selected was, however, simply unrealistic.
Of course, the suspicion remains that Montgomerie may never fulfil his
potential if, when things go against him, particularly at the end of a round,
he keeps having attacks of ``the Red Mist''. To be a master chef requires the
discipline to stand the heat in the kitchen.
Actually, Montgomerie was by no means the only sinner in Jamaica. At least two
other players, presumably out of earshot of authority or what spectators there
were, were criticised for their bad language and the Open champion, John Daly,
for his ``lack of pride'' in failing to break 80 in any round.
Certainly it is difficult to imagine a major championship winner from earlier
generations succumbing so apathetically. They, of course, did not have to
contend with what seems from this vantage point to be the corrupting influence
of lucrative but irrelevant post-season tournaments to deflect them from their
true priorities.
With Daly we seem to have a loose cannon rampaging about the deck of golf. We
may wish it otherwise, but both Daly and Montgomerie - in their very different
ways, of course - seem bent on conferring on the game that double edged Chinese
invocation: ``May you live in interesting times.''

<HEADLINE>Frost floors Boxing Day programme</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

FROST threatens to destroy the Boxing Day racing programme as nine of the 10
meetings scheduled for today have either been abandoned already - or face a
similar fate in the morning.
Only Newton Abbot, where waterlogging rather than frost looked to pose the most
potent threat, looks relatively free of problems.
Newton Abbot's clerk of the course Michael Trickey had planned to look at the
course at 4.15pm yesterday, and although one obstacle from both the chase and
hurdle course will have to be omitted, he reported that no further inspection
for today is planned.
``The water jump on the chase course and the final hurdle on the hurdle course
will be omitted, as the ground there is heavily waterlogged,'' he said. ``Now
we have to pray that the frost doesn't get us.''
Ayr's fixture was first to fall yesterday. Course manager Mark Kershaw said
after an 11.30 inspection yesterday. ``We have had continual severe frosts and
there is snow as well.
``There is enough snow alone to have to call the meeting off, so with the two
combined we thought there was no point in prolonging the agony. It's bloody
frustrating but that's the winter for you.''
Only once has an Ayr meeting survived the elements on Boxing Day since the
track was first awarded a fixture on that day in 1993.
The toll rose to two when Sedgefield's card was abandoned in the afternoon.
Today the groundstaff at Kempton, due to stage the King George VI Tripleprint
Chase, will be among the earliest to rise in order to look at the track at
6.30am.
There was a frost at Sunbury last night but Michael Webster reported the course
fit for racing earlier yesterday.
The meeting is scheduled to be televised live on Channel Four, and in the event
of an abandonment, coverage will switch to Leopardstown, itself the subject of
a precautionary inspection at 6.30am.
Ashley Bealby, clerk of the course at Wolverhampton, will also conduct an
inspection at 6.30am tomorrow to decide whether the course will be able to
stage the inaugural fixture on its revamped National Hunt course.
The forecast of frost has prompted inspections at Market Rasen and Wincanton at
7am today, with checks at Hereford, Huntingdon and Wetherby taking place half
an hour later.
Charlie Moore, clerk of the course at Market Rasen, rates his fixture's chances
as ``60-40 against'', while at Wetherby, where the #25,000-added Rowland
Meyrick Handicap Chase was due to form the feature of the card, a spokeswoman
for clerk of the course Chris Tetley said: ``The prospects are not good.''
Only Wincanton's Ian Renton was upbeat in his forecast of whether racing could
take place.

HELP for pensioners would be a priority for the Scottish National Party during
the first four years of independence.
A Pensioners' Package announced by the SNP proposes an increase in state
pension of #3 for a single person and #5 for a married couple, along with the
abolition of means-testing for residential care for the elderly.
The party is also proposing weekly cold climate allowance payments of #7.40p in
Southern Scotland and #11.15 in Northern Scotland to combat fuel poverty which
affects 800,000 households. Ms Kay Ullrich, SNP social affairs spokesperson,
said they were achievable on the basis of increased growth, access to North Sea
revenues, and withdrawal from the Trident programme.
