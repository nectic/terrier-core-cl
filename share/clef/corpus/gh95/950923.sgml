Liz Taylor discovers that keeping cool can be a beautiful pastime
IF IT is decorative quality you are after, some of the most attractive
things to collect are fans. They come in many sizes, a multitude of
colours and designs, and a huge variety of materials. What is more, most
of them have not yet soared into the realms of the super-expensive and
it is still possible to pick up a pretty fan for about #10 if you are
lucky. Because of their relative cheapness and prettiness, fans make a
favourite subject for young girls starting out in the collecting world.
Every year Christie's in London hold four sales devoted to fans and
next week, on Tuesday, a large auction with almost 350 lots is being
mounted. Included in it are some beautiful examples, and also some that
will be snapped up because of their rarity.
To start with the rare, a printed fan, made to commemorate the birth
of the future George IV in 1762, decorated with etchings of Queen
Charlotte and her baby, his Prince of Wales feathers, and an inscribed
prayer, carries an estimate of between #500 and #1000.
The George IV connection is continued by another very delicate
Cantonese brise fan, carved and pierced with figures and buildings,
which was brought from China by the brother of Miss Frances Daniell, a
Herbwoman at the coronation of George IV in 1820. Miss Daniell
subsequently eloped to Gretna Green with Dr Reynolds, a friend of the
King -- and presumably took her fan with her. Its estimate is around
#500.
Also rare is a wooden fan painted with copies of Pellegrini's Spy and
Ape cartoons showing politicians like Disraeli, Gladstone, and the
Marquess of Lorne (estimate around #150); and a very pretty fan painted
with the face of a cat with a pink ribbon round its neck (about #800).
Among the more expensive fans is an unusual seventeenth-century one
from Ceylon made of radiating segments of ivory framed in gilt copper
from a metal boss representing mythical birds, which is expected to sell
for around #2000. About #1000 will buy a mid-eighteenth-century fan
painted with a scene of lovers at the Temple of Love that once belong to
Queen Marie of Romania; a silk fan painted with scenes of famous
balloonists, making their daring ascents in France between 1783 and
1785; or a fan with mother-of-pearl sticks and its leaf painted with a
fete-champetre by the Swiss artist Giovanni Vanoni, who worked in
Locarno in the 1880s.
A modern ostrich-feather fan, made to commemorate the wedding of
Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1981, is in the sale with an
estimate of about #600.
An equally unfortunate commemoration is the birth in 1781 of the
Dauphin, son of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, which was celebrated
with a silk fan painted with musicians, cherubs, and bird-catchers and
embroidered with sequins. Its estimate is around #1500.
Among the most expensive items are two eighteenth-century French fans,
one with ivory sticks and Point d'Angleterre lace worked as a scene
showing Neptune in his chariot (between #2000 and #3000); and the other
a magnificent fan, also with ivory sticks and a leaf painted with the
Paradise of the Gods and inscribed in French with amorous mottoes like
''J'ai perdu ma liberte''. The mottoes are painted on alternate red and
green sticks and decorated with circles of mother of pearl. Christie's
expert Susan Mayor expects this fan to sell for about #6000.
Fans are sometimes still used for advertising purposes and collectors
seek these out. Among several lots of advertising fans in the sale are
some issued by Air India, restaurants in Brussels, Rio de Janeiro, and
London, cigarette companies, BOAC, Claridge's Hotel, Cognac Martell,
Benedictine, and Japan Air Lines. They are all fairly modestly priced
and a lot of 30 advertising fans carries an estimate of around #200.
Susan Mayor, as well as being Christie's fan specialist, is the author
of several books on the subject, and her latest, Collecting Fans, which
is published by Studio Editions at the modest price of #4.99, has just
been released. She is also the secretary of Fan Circle International,
which is celebrating its twentieth anniversary this year.
The Circle maintains a Fan Museum in Crooms Hill, Greenwich, where an
exhibition of members' most cherished fans is currently running (until
the beginning of October).
The Circle sends out a regular bulletin called ''Fans'' and membership
costs #14 a year. To join, contact Mrs J D Milligan, Cronk-Y-Voddy,
Rectory Road, Coltishall, Norwich NR12 7HF.

THE John Collins saga took a new twist last night when the Celtic and
Scotland midfield man spoke out for the first time about the speculation
which has been abounding about his future in the game.
The man, who joined Celtic from Hibernian five years ago and whose
contract runs out at the end of this season, claims he is being driven
out of Parkhead, and that he doesn't want to leave the club, but that he
has not been offered a new contract.
It is also obvious that all is not well between the player and the
Celtic management, with Collins claiming that they have not told the
truth and have been clouding the issue.
Speaking on BBC television's Sportscene, the internationalist said:
''It all started two weeks before the Scottish Cup final when I felt
something was not right between me and the manager. I asked my agent,
Raymond Sparkes, to arrange a meeting between myself, the manager, and
his assistant. The outcome of that meeting was that Celtic would be
prepared to sell me. My agent was given a licence to go out and invite
English clubs to make bids for me.
''The arrangement was that when Tommy Burns got in two or three new
players, I would be out of the door -- if the bid was right. The fact
that he didn't get the players meant I had to carry on, which I have
done.
''For the past four months fans have been stopping me and asking when
I was leaving and why I wanted to leave. You can only kid the fans on
for so long and that is the reason I am speaking out.
''I feel disappointed that the club has not come out and told the
truth. Instead they have clouded the issue and that has put extra
pressure on me.
''I would like to stay with Celtic, but I'm just like anyone else.
When you feel you are not wanted or appreciated at your place of work,
you feel that maybe you should move somewhere where you will be wanted
and appreciated.''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns, who earlier in the day had stressed that
he would be talking to the player ''when the time was right,'' later
issued a statement which said: ''John Collins is a Celtic player and
should be concentrating his efforts on playing for the club. He has been
kept informed of all developments.''
The manager said that only one club, Middlesbrough, had made a bid for
the player.
Jackie McNamara: still highly valued by Dunfermline.
McNamara price must be right
Meantime, Celtic, or any other club, will have to pay out around
#800,000 if they want to sign Dunfermline's under-21 international
midfielder Jackie McNamara -- and even then, they will come up against
stiff competition from the English Premiership.
Although manager Burns kept to his usual style of refusing to talk
about transfers before they actually happen, Dunfermline manager Bert
Paton did confirm that Celtic had made an enquiry about the youngster,
whose father Jackie played for Celtic in the sixties.
Said the East End Park manager: ''We have had an enquiry from Celtic,
but they are not the only club interested. We would obviously like to
keep Jackie, but we are resigned to the fact that we could lose him.
There are financial pressures on the club, and everyone has a price.
However nobody is leaving this club on the cheap.''
Paton confirmed that the youngster would be in his usual place when
the first division leaders visit Greenock to play Morton this afternoon.
It is understood that Celtic would be prepared to pay around #400,000
for McNamara, but it is certain the Fife club would want more than
double that. And with English premiership clubs also watching the
situation, Dunfermline are in a good position. I understand that the
major interest from England is coming from Arsenal, Tottenham, and
Bolton.
Burns did reveal yesterday that Chris Waddle, the 34-year-old
Sheffield Wednesday midfield man, had been ''very keen'' to join Celtic,
but that he had turned down the chance for family reasons.

In a short series starting today, Ron Marshall and photographer Edward
Jones embark on a tour of some of the lesser-known, but no less
enchanting, courses in the Home of golf. This week, the South.
AT peace with the world, with only Ken Bruce for company on Radio 2, I
was in the early stages of carrying out the kind of commission that
encourages forbearance, philosophical nods, occasional gasps of
amazement, nosiness, toytown shorthand, and not a little stamina. Add to
these questionable elements an appreciation of the Scottish countryside,
and of the game of golf, and you might begin to divine the purpose of my
little odyssey.
In simple terms, the gent who oversees this part of Weekend Extra
suggested an exploration of this golf-mad country of ours, noting along
the way what other pastimes exist, and bearing in mind that folk need
food and shelter.
The idea is to look at Scotland, divided into three areas -- the
south, middle, and north.
The brief is wide, the only provisos being to steer clear of the
''starry'' courses, the ones already well documented, and, more
difficult to reconcile, to concentrate on just half a dozen clubs in
each area.
As I chuntered along on the A75, it was another of those gorgeously
bright mornings that have characterised this summer to end all summers.
The sunroof was pushed fully open -- not such a good move. For out of
the sky from behind, bat-like from Hades and, I convinced myself, 10ft
above the open roof, swooped a metallic chunk of malevolence, whether a
Phantom, Harrier, or Jaguar it was impossible to identify, but the
after-effect of the thunderclap vainly pursuing it gave you a chilling
idea what it must feel like to be the recipient of those electric pads
so beloved of hospital-drama makers, the ones that make an inert body
leap a foot off the bed.
Apparently Luce Bay is regularly used for bombing practice, the planes
operating out of West Freugh. Locals get advance warning, it's nice to
know, in the free press sheet circulating in the area.
The earlier part of the morning had been taken up travelling from
Glasgow to Stranraer, the first of my six chosen destinations. What did
I know about the place, other than having played the golf course once a
couple of years ago? Nothing really, but that was to be put right by a
quartet of members whose combined ages must have been nudging three
centuries.
Andrew Hannay (83) and Jimmy Blair (81) were the doyens, and who
better to be preparing the official history of Stranraer Golf Club,
which came into existence six years before Andrew was born. Relative
youngsters around the table were Donald Cameron, a retired master of the
Larne Sealink ferry, and Gordon Ross, a former civil servant. His forte
was local history.
''You can see from the fifth tee, up towards the head of Loch Ryan, an
estate where the trees are laid out to represent the troops' formation
in the Battle of Corunna in the Peninsular War, Britain against the
French,'' he explained.
''Sir John Moore, whose descendants lived here, was our
commander-in-chief, and after being mortally wounded during the retreat
he was buried at Corunna.''
Stranraer's golf course has one great claim to fame -- it was the last
to be designed by the ubiquitous James Braid, five times winner of the
Open Championship at the start of the century. He was called from
retirement but unfortunately died before the official opening in 1952.
With no time to renew acquaintances with the course it was time to
head for Southerness, around 60 miles east along the Solway Firth.
En route the name of a tiny village rang a bell and prompted the
briefest of diversions -- into Twynholm, home of Scotland's newest Grand
Prix hero, David Coulthard. Naturally he was away screaming round some
foreign circuit at 200 miles an hour but his brother did confirm that
the name I'd spotted on the village war memorial, Thomas W. Coulthard R
N, was indeed part of the family. David's grandfather's oldest brother,
he'd been lost at sea in the First World War, at the age of 17.
Off the A75 through Dalbeattie and along the coast to Southerness
there's no room for Coulthard-type driving.
It had been more than 20 years since my one and only sojourn to the
course (a caravan weekend with wife and weans in the company of three
buddies similarly shackled . . . eh . . . accompanied), and here, too,
the most obvious change was the creation of a modern clubhouse. In our
day part of the Paul Jones Hotel (yes, founder of the American Navy,
born just up the road at Kirkbean) provided changing accommodation. Now
you can watch oyster-catchers, ducks, gulls, and geese battle the
elements from the comfort of the clubhouse's spacious lounge.
My table companions this time were Doonhamers -- so instead of the
clubhouse we met in Barbours, Dumfries' answer to Frasers Store. What a
busy wee town . . . nice stone buildings . . . lots of car-parks -- but
clearly not enough judging by the reps' fleets cruising the one-way
system.
Bill Train, 77 next month and looking 10 years younger, was
Southerness secretary for 17 years from 1972. The incumbent is Bill
Ramage. The third member at the table was retired G P, Jack Cochrane.
His golfing claim to fame was playing in the Open Championship at Royal
Lytham in 1958, carding a ''scratchy'' 79-over Fairhaven in the opening
round, but immensely proud of a 72 on the Championship course, not good
enough, alas, to make the 36-hole cut.
Southerness, designed in 1946 by Mackenzie Ross, whose more
illustrious work was at Turnberry, took a while to be nationally
recognised but the Scottish amateur championship was played there in
1985, returning again this summer.
Other big events have included the Scottish women's and British
women's stroke-play titles on a linksland course by common consent one
of the country's toughest. Their most accomplished ''new boy'' is
Scottish professional champion Andrew Coltart, who was invited to join
the club just more than a year ago.
Would-be visitors shouldn't be put off by the remoteness of the
location. Accommodation to suit every pocket, from caravans to
comfortable hotels, is in abundance.
The town of Moffat offered a complete contrast to the Solway's
attractions. So did its golf course, a firm favourite for visiting
parties. Winding your way uphill -- near the sign that trumpets a
Scotland in Bloom conquest -- you're rewarded with a panoramic view of
the Tweedsmuir and Lowther Hills. Then, using yet another spanking new
clubhouse, brace yourself for 18 holes without recourse to an oxygen
mask. Only kidding . . . .
One other hole, the ninth, named Port Arthur, deserves mention.
''Steep Hill, 1 in 2 Gradient,'' the sign would read if it were a
roadway. It's only 125 yards but with a menacing rock face to add to the
difficulties it's hardly surprising that a group of retired gents who
call themselves the Baffies choose to omit four holes, including Port
Arthur, from their regular Friday outing.
For a while, though, one of them refused such indulgence. Willie
Donaldson, retired blacksmith and former county player and club
champion, declined the concession well into his seventies -- he was
still working, he explained -- and chose to play the course as laid out.
Only the inconvenience of a heart attack five or six years ago brought
him into line with everyone else.
Moffat boasts beautiful gardens, woollen mills, a town centre a la
Biggar or Grantown, a statue of a ram with no ears, the burial place of
the eponymous Tar McAdam, and fine staging posts like the Moffat House,
Beechwood, and Country House Hotels. It also provides the road over the
hills to Hawick.
Why Hawick, you might ask. Maybe it was the Faldo link with the
Pringle company -- he's played the course twice, once in the company of
another jersey promoter, Colin Montgomerie. Or perhaps I was lured by
the club's advert in Golf Monthly (''a spectacular course on the Vertish
Hill, enjoying panoramic views of the surrounding scenery -- Bring your
camera!'').
Alas, the camera stayed in its bag. Bill stayed indoors. Pringle
sweaters, if they were being worn, were well obscured under overcoats
and anoraks, and only one poor soul of a worker was on the course,
helping create a path down a precipitous slope.
A sudden heavy rainstorm had kiboshed notions of those panoramic
views. Anyway a natter with retired greenkeeper Ralph Henderson and the
club captain Eric Robertson provided a pleasant alternative.
Eric is one of those people whose very presence forces everyone to
choose words carefully whenever the clubhouse fruit machines are
mentioned. None of your ''one-armed bandit'' lingo for Hawick members --
Eric, by coming off second-best in a little contretemps with a train in
Hawick Station a long time ago, lost his left arm, but now playing off a
handicap of nine he's still reckoned to be a bit of a bandit in club
competitions.
Ralph, who retired last year, is proud to have served the club for 28
years. The revolution in greenkeeping equipment has been staggering --
but mole-catching's still done in the old-fashioned way, setting a trap
under the turf. ''Mind you, whenever I need some good soil I delay
trapping them because they very kindly leave me piles of lovely earth!''
he muses.
Hawick's High Street is dominated by a splendid piece of turreted
Victorian architecture, the HQ of Roxburgh District Council. The arrow
on a huge barometer on its wall pointed at CHANGE. It hadn't. The
gutters were still running furiously.
Away from golf, Hawick folk keep sacrosanct the second week in June
for the Common Riding celebrations, they love their Rugby, of course,
and if you feel inclined, the Pringle factory organises visitors' tours.
At this point the car should have been making its way towards the
coastal town of Eyemouth but the clock had won the battle on this
particular jaunt. None the less my scouts tell me the nine-hole course
is definitely worth sampling, notwithstanding imminent upheaval because
of a grand scheme to restructure the harbour area. This will mean a road
running through the middle of the course -- but salvation is at hand.
Adjacent ground will become available to upgrade the course to 18 holes.
One big question was being asked 15 years ago at the club -- when is a
centenary not a centenary? Apparently the Golfers' Handbook, long
considered the game's bible, indicates that the club was formed in 1880.
Not true, say the historians.
Although some letters dated 1881 suggest the creation of the club, it
was 1892 before meetings were held, and two more years before the club
was registered with the R&amp;A. After a year of ''centenary'' celebrations
15 years ago, it seems the activities last year were a little subdued.
Eyemouth folk are rightly proud of the place -- third biggest fishing
port on the Scottish coast, they claim (and with a picturesque harbour),
beautiful sands, a leisure centre, and for those who appreciate good
food the Old Bakehouse is a historic landmark in the town centre. The
Ship Hotel is another major social hub.
The last port of call was the thriving town of Peebles. It's the Royal
Burgh's coat of arms, one salmon swimming upstream and two downstream,
that reflects possibly the area's main attraction, the River Tweed which
bisects Peebles.
It's one of those instantly likeable towns -- nice shops of some
quality, a modern leisure centre, the medieval tower Neidpath Castle a
mile away, where centuries ago lives lost were counted cheaply, and
farther on, Stobo Castle, where pounds lost are counted triumphantly by
its health-farm clientele.
Peebles Golf Club is 103 years old (Hawick is the Borders' oldest at
118), boasting a Walker Cup player and British amateur champion in Alex
Kyle the year the Second World War broke out. And how many modern
professionals would be prepared to play three rounds in one day, as
James Braid did at Peebles in 1910?
The course is in splendid condition, thanks mainly to the acquisition
of former Mortonhall greenkeeper Donald Menzies. ''We really shouldn't
be telling anybody about him,'' confides Ken Allan, a retired chief
superintendent and former British police champion. ''You know how golf
clubs are always keen to poach good staff.''
Ken was, however, happy to endorse the ''small-town atmosphere''
Peebles offers, and in the midst of extolling the culinary virtues of
the Oven D'Or, the Sunflower, and the Old Mill at Blyth Bridge, his
other half, quietly feeding the club's one-armed bandit in the
background, was remarkably subdued as a #100 jackpot rewarded her
perseverance.
That definitely called for a night out in Peebles.

Echoes from a Tower, Rowan Tree Company (Yarrow)
* As part of The Travels of Mungo Park stage-production, these songs
and narratives may well blend in with the furniture, but exposed on CD
the Rowans' settings of James Hogg songs and Judy Steel poems are a
different matter. Although good enough in small doses, ultimately the
raw-nerved singing and earnestly inventive fiddle arrangements walk the
wrong side of a fine line between bravery and atonality.
Ru-Ra, Tannas (Lochshore)
* Their second album, Ru-Ra once again hints at Tannas's potential.
Sandra and Doreen MacKay's pure Gaelic singing can be very effective,
and Donald Shaw's clear production does much to emphasise this. But
despite that and some fine playing from the group and various session
musicians, the pervading new-agey feel holds them firmly in the
Capercaillie-without-the-impact bracket.

Super Ape Inna Jungle, Lee Perry featuring the Mad Professor, Douggie
Digital and Juggler (Ariwa)
* Assisted by some of his current studio torchbearers, ageless
dub-master Perry adds some of his freaked, spaced-out, tweaked-up
essence to this heady junglist broth. What does it sound like? Like
nothing you've ever quite heard before. Tectonic bass noises engage with
seas of revved-up percussion while onlookers weep, emitting small cries
of joy and bafflement. Jungle: it may well do for reggae what jazz did
for ragtime.
Mark's Keyboard Repair, Money Mark (Mo'Wax)
* Intriguing evidence that dance music's avoidance of the strictures
imposed by conventional song-structure has rippled out into rock's freer
margins. In other words, a loose assembly of loopy and unravelled
explorations in sound, cf Beck. At times, of course, it's all a little
too unravelled, too fragmented for its own good, its ideas spread too
thinly over 19 tracks. But let us nonetheless praise advances in
recording technology which are allowing people with talent to work at
home when the moment takes them, free of formality and large-scale
budgets. Eventually, given the imposition of a greater discipline, Money
Mark's genre-busting easy-listening ambient jazz-hop may coalesce into
something more than the work of a Wild Man Fischer for the nineties.
Spinner, Brian Eno and Jah Wobble (All Saints)
* Originated by Brian Eno as a film soundtrack for Derek Jarman's
posthumously-released Glitterbug and then breathed upon by Mr Wobble.
Eno's deadpan sleeve notes observe that the end-product has been found
to be ''a very satisfactory companion for a walk along the Grand Union
Canal from Bethnal Green and up through the Lea Valley''. Its
atmospheric, shadowy sonic evocations may function less effectively on
the towpaths of the Firhill Basin, but this is a piece of perambulatory
pleasure all the same.
Live At The BBC, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac (Castle)
* Not to be confused with the latterday California Airheads' Fleetwood
Mac. This two-CD collection of 36 songs, recorded in 1969 and 1970,
charts the original band's transformation of standard white-boy
blues-boogie bluster into something uniquely driven, haunted and
haunting. Thus alongside fey, Anglified outbreaks of Buddy Holly-style
pop-rock, you get the strange rock-pop of songs like Only You, plus the
baroque psychedelic resignation of Oh Well and Man Of The World. And all
of it carried by the brooding, fluid, diamond-sharp guitar of Peter
Green.

Lullaby of Birdland, Lee Konitz (Candid)
* Must-have live recording of alto saxophonist Konitz in concert at
the Birdland club in New York. This great value CD -- 63 minutes --
comprises a thoughtful selection of numbers: from the obligatory,
footstompingly funky Lullaby of Birdland to the laid-back Thelonious
Monk tune, Ask Me Now -- a perfect vehicle for Konitz and his ace
pianist, Barry Harris. Konitz's slightly abrasive alto style is
distinctly smoother on the romantic and wistful This Is Always -- too
bad about the clinking (or is it breaking?) of glasses in the
background.
Jubilee!, The Great British Jazz Band (Candid)
* Ten-man band whose instrumentation follows the Ark theory -- two of
everything: Digby Fairweather and Mike Cotton share trumpet duties;
trombonists Pete Strange and Roy Williams are both featured, while Dave
Shepherd and the brilliant John Barnes take turns on clarinet. The
overall impression is of a highly arranged and stylised outfit, which in
some cases -- like the richly textured, and rarely played, Washboard
Blues -- works to the band's advantage, but in too many instances pushes
it closer to blandness.

IT'S a widely held misconception that once the Protestant heavy mob
got the bit between their teeth at the commencement of the Reformation
they swept all before them. The remarkable story of the, albeit very
temporary, resurrection of St Giles is an indicator that it wasn't all
one-way traffic.
As they waged war against idolatry across the country in the late
1550s it was predictable that the patron saint and guardian of the city
of Edinburgh, Giles, should come in for some serious attention.
According to the histories of the time the principal image of the saint
was put through a weird process of execution, first of all being
formally ''drowned'' in the Nor Loch and afterwards consigned to the
flames.
The Catholic bishops, dismayed by this performance and the general
mayhem which threatened, and seeing their authority and comfortable life
slipping away, demanded that the Regent, Mary of Guise, should
intervene. Four of the chief Reforming preachers were eventually
summoned to Edinburgh on September 1 -- by coincidence or crafty design
the feast day of St Giles when the tradition was that the image of the
saint was carted around the town. Normally the saint's day cleverly
combined devotion and prayer with a bit of a party, apparently in about
equal measure.
Seeking to further reinforce their supremacy, having persuaded the
Regent to act, the bishops ordered Edinburgh town council to replace the
image which had been destroyed. The magistrates replied that the
Scriptures had ordered the taking down of idols and even when they were
threatened with excommunication, they refused to budge.
This led to a frantic search of the city for an appropriate
substitute. Eventually, on the morning of the feast day, an image was
borrowed from the monastery of the Greyfriars, money being left in
pledge for its safe return. Having been nailed to a small cart, this
haun-knitted substitute for the city's saint was borne aloft on the
shoulders of the priests. The procession got under way to the noisy
accompaniment of trumpets, tabors (small drums), and bagpipes, and
banners were held aloft as the Protestant throng began to gather along
the route.
The reaction of this section of the crowd was initially one of mockery
which gradually built into a simmering anger. It seems, however, that as
long as Mary of Guise remained with the marchers the crowd restrained
themselves. As soon as the Regent left for a tea-break, the full fury of
the Reformers exploded to cries of ''Down with the Idol''.
The priests were barged and pushed in the hope that this would send St
Giles tumbling but because the image had been nailed to the barrow the
mob had to tear it down, thereafter ''battering it upon the stones until
the head and limbs flew off''. Fearing a similar fate for themselves the
priests took off down the causeway.
Mary's anger at news of this sacrilege was immense and a search was
ordered with the intention of putting the rioters behind bars. This, not
surprisingly, proved a much more difficult task than might have been
thought. Half the city had been involved in the dingin' doon of the St
Giles substitute.

THERE was a time when it seemed that the great jazz players died
young, back then in those ''yesterdays, sequestered days'' as the song
so eloquently put it.
And at that time, when I was buying my 78s and beginning to realise
what this music means, I believed that. After all we had Bix
Beiderbecke, and Bunny Berigan, and Frank Teschemacher, and Frankie
Newton, and Hot Lips Page, and I could go on, and on, and on.
And, as a kid, growing up and listening to the beauty of the music and
trying to understand the romance of it all, I was ready to believe that
the good did die young.
OK, some of them did. But there were others, older musicians who never
did impress me. God, do you remember Bunk Johnson? And I know some of
you will and tell me I'm wrong, but I do wish that no-one had bought him
his false teeth and brought him up to New York from New Iberia where, as
legend tells, he was picking cotton, what else?
Because so many people have since shown that Bunk was simply a bad
player. It was nothing to do with his teeth or his age. Nowadays we have
many people who are defying the age barrier and showing that no matter
how old they are they can still play. And, basically, that is all that
matters!
Now we have something happening which demonstrates just how well older
musicians can play. I did say a few weeks back that when I had heard the
latest issues featuring trumpeter Joe Wilder I would pass on that
information.
So here goes: Wilder, at 72, is scarcely the oldest player on the
issues I have unearthed. On one, on Reference Recordings, he is playing
with Dick Hyman who put together a group which also contained Scotsman
Joe Temperley on baritone, the inimitable Urbie Green on trombone, Phil
Bodner, an unsung hero, if ever there was one, on alto and clarinet, and
other peers.
Wilder, though, is glorious on an Ellington number Dooji Wooji and
another Johnny Hodges song I Know What You Do where he uses a plunger
mute to marvellous effect. Not like Bubber Miley. Not like Cootie
Williams. But just like Joe Wilder and there is nothing at all wrong
with that . . .
On the second issue, on Arbors Jazz, he is a junior member of the
ensemble. Saxophonist Benny Waters was 93 when he cut these sides.
Violinist Claude Williams was 86 and most of the members of the group
were in their eighties . . .
And yet the music you hear decries that. This is lively, inventive,
swinging jazz from an era which will never leave us.
And when you hear Wilder swop choruses and fours with Clark Terry on
Just Squeeze Me it is almost as if you have Rex Stewart trading ideas
with himself.
It is a glorious track and a glorious CD issue, and it is dedicated to
the Statesmen of Jazz, a group of senior citizens who can still show
what this wonderful music is about.
Listen and then try to give me excuses about poor Bunk and his false
teeth . . .

Your little darlings have a lot to learn when they take their first
steps in the university of life -- not least, it seems, how to
feedthemselves. Lady Claire Macdonald has some helpful advice.
THIS month sees hundreds of students leaving home to go to colleges
and universities the length and breadth of the country. I'm ashamed to
say that the plight of the student, when it came to feeding, passed me
by with our poor eldest daughter (the eldest in the family is ever the
experiment). It was only two years ago -- when our second daughter
started college in Edinburgh and, sounding particularly tired on the
phone one evening, told me how she was worn out not by her course but by
the effort of shopping for food, thinking what she was going to eat,
cooking it, and washing up -- that set me thinking how ill-prepared the
average student is to cater for him or herself.
I quizzed our eldest daughter who, to her credit, was only mildly
reproachful when I asked her what she ate as a new student nurse. The
answer was baked beans and beer, which accounts for the ballooning of
her previously sylphlike figure during that time.
I was then prompted to give the matter further thought when I was
invited to give a Perthshire school's sixth-form some ideas as to what
to cook when they had finished with school food and were in charge of
their own diets.
I came to the conclusion that there were three priorities: nutrition,
cost, and speed. I put them in that order, but I think most students
would reverse them!
You can eat surprisingly well and very inexpensively if the subject is
given a little thought -- thought, and a microwave oven. So many things
can be cooked at speed in a microwave that I would hope every flat and
halls of residence is equipped with such an invaluable gadget, and
judging by the little research I have done, luckily such is the case.
You think of baked potatoes with baked beans. It is made better, from
the taste aspect, by adding a couple of ounces of grated cheddar cheese,
and if a raw carrot is eaten with it you have a meal that is hard to
fault from the nutritional point of view. If students can have drummed
into them the importance of eating raw fruit and vegetables rather than
just crisps, Mars bars, and toast, then two-thirds of the battle is won.
It is so much easier to cook and shop for more than one. If three or
four can club together and pool the effort of their catering there will
be benefits all round. If there were to be a list of items with which to
equip your student son or daughter I would put three at the top -- a
good heavy casserole, a sharp knife (Kitchen Devil, 4in blade), and a
chopping board.
The reason for the first item is that one-dish meals will always be
popular for students because of the clearing and washing up. If
everything can be cooked in one -- meat (if they eat it), vegetables,
and starch, whether in the form of pasta, rice, or potatoes -- that will
be a great help to them.
Many students will be vegetarians, but just as many will be meat and
fish eaters, and for the latter to be taught how quickly fish cooks will
be a help. I always reckon that fish is the original convenience food.
But there is another equally quickly cooked meat, and cheaper than
fish -- offal. Lamb's kidneys are delicious, good for you, and
inexpensive. They take a couple of minutes to cook and they go very well
with bacon, baked potatoes, and any green vegetable, raw or cooked, but
one of the cheapest and best to accompany kidneys and bacon is cabbage.
Raw, cabbage can be sliced thinly and mixed, if you like, with chopped
apple and a teaspoon of mustard mixed with a tablespoon or two of
mayonnaise.
If microwaving, cabbage can be washed, cut in wedges, and cooked in
five minutes. Liver, too, is relatively cheap and quick to cook. The
only potential problem with both liver and kidneys is for the sqeamish,
when it comes to their preparation, but sharp scissors make the trimming
of both a quick task.
Stir-frying is quick but the preparation isn't -- for methodical
students who think ahead, the slicing and chopping can be done hours in
advance, providing there is fridge space to store the bowls of prepared
ingredients, and then the actual stirring takes minutes.
I recommend Ken Hom's Quick and Easy Chinese Cooking in the BBC
Publications' Quick and Easy range.
I always hope that students, once let loose in the kitchen, will be
fired by enthusiasm for cooking and realise just how much fun catering
for themselves can be. Once there is a spark of fun injected into the
daily planning, the effort vanishes. Then comes the desire to
experiment.
Pasta dishes, for example, can be so quick and delicious, providing
the pasta isn't overcooked and that once drained, it is tossed in a
couple of tablespoons of olive oil which prevents it sticking together.
You can then add chopped garlic and chopped parsley (done with scissors,
into a mug -- it doesn't matter if it isn't finely chopped) and serve
with grated cheese -- preferably parmesan, but on a student's budget
more likely to be cheddar! The parsley provides the vitamins, the pasta
the carbohydrates, and the oil and garlic the taste -- what more could
you want? And the cost is pence!
SAUSAGE AND VEGETABLE CASSEROLE
* SERVES 4.
1lb pork sausages -- as good quality as can be bought
2 onions, skinned and chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
4 potatoes, peeled and chopped
1-2 cloves of garlic (optional) skinned and chopped
1 tin of chopped tomatoes
salt, pepper
1 tin consomme, or 1 pint beef stock
[1/2] small cabbage, trimmed and chopped quite small
2 tbsp oil -- sunflower or olive oil.
Heat the oil in a heavy casserole. Slit down each sausage with the
sharp knife and peel off the skins. Put the chopped onions into the
casserole and cook for 3-4 minutes then add the skinned sausages. Mash
them about, breaking them up with your wooden spoon. Add the chopped
garlic, prepared carrots and potatoes, contents of the tin of tomatoes,
stock, and salt and pepper. Stir till this all just begins to bubble.
Cook, without the lid, with the contents of the casserole barely
bubbling, for 1 hour. Stir from time to time to prevent the mixture from
sticking. It will thicken as it cooks. Stir in the cabbage and cook for
a further 15 minutes before serving. You can make this in advance
providing you store it, when cooled, in a fridge -- just add the chopped
cabbage before you reheat it. You can bulk out this dish with extra
vegetables, and you can vary it with other root vegetables such as
turnip and parsnip.

The trains come and go at Stirling Station, Lesley Duncan reports that
the flowers are here to stay
STIRLING was a special kind of place even before Hollywood discovered
it. As such it has a special kind of railway station. The architect
James Miller -- improbable as it may seem -- also designed Glasgow's
Royal Infirmary. Stirling Station (vintage 1913) may lack the grandness
of that vast edifice but its grey stone frontage, complete with
crowstepped gables and wrought-iron gate, has a dignity that quite
eludes contemporary railstops.
Step inside and be even more pleasantly surprised. Not only do the
curved concourse, the broad curved stairway, and the soaring roof
girders speak of confident public architecture, but the place is
festooned with flowers -- flowers in window boxes, flowers in wooden
tubs, flowers on the roofs of kiosks and left-luggage lockers, flowers
in hanging baskets.
No wonder Stirling Station frequently wins awards. A quick guide of
this year's plants would make many a gardener or greenhouse-owner
envious. On the main concourse the tall windows of the booking hall are
brightened at ground level by a flourish of giant pink petunias, set off
by trailing white and blue lobelia. Tubbed conifers have frills of more
lobelia. Under the clock, white and purple petunias, conifers, and
lobelia make a contrasting colour statement. Houseplants with velvety
crimson leaves edged in green are used for another window decoration,
while yet more tubs spout spider plants and miniature begonias.
Buying the morning paper or a sustaining tube of Smarties, you can't
fail to notice the riot of colour on the roof of the John Menzies shop
-- tobacco plants; pink and red geraniums; giant begonias in oranges,
pinks, and crimsons; hanging baskets of fuchsias flaunting their crimson
and purple; even a small palm tree. Every angle of the bridge has its
flowers. The piece de resistance comes at the top of the stair leading
to the main Glasgow and Edinburgh platform on its central island. A
leafy green head grins at commuters above another carpet of flowers.
Fuchsias flourish here.
From the top of this staircase, you look down at the main passenger
waiting-room. This used to have a huge mirror which reflected back the
flowers growing on the windowsills, doubling their colour and charm. It
was a sight to lift travellers' spirits. Several years ago the mirror
and old two-way clocks were replaced by lavatories and computerised
information systems respectively. Such is progress.
Still the flowers are as bonny as ever -- geraniums in shades of
white, pink, and red; more trailing lobelia; and French marigolds.
Baskets of lobelia hang in the archways to the next platform, which has
starred in period films.
Over on platforms 9 and 10, the old Motorail site, pink hydrangeas
share a centre bed with conifers. A painted tractor-wheel sports purple
petunias and nasturtiums.
The man responsible for all this colourful bounty is George Spence.
The 58-year-old was a train driver until problems with his hearing
dictated early retirement. His wife Mary explains how at Stirling
Station there has been ''a history'' of always having flowers.
Starting 14 years ago, her husband, in between driving shifts, used to
help the retired railwayman then looking after them. For six years he in
turn has been attending to the flowers, with some aid now from colleague
Robert Erskine. When Spence had to leave his driving job it seemed that
Stirling Station's summer displays might become a thing of the past.
Happily, Spence is paid by ScotRail to continue this civilised and
pleasant tradition. He's down at the station every weekday from morning
to early afternoon.
Stirling Station won second prize for medium-sized station gardens
this year (pipped by Dumfries), having carried off the first prize (then
without categories) two years ago. As long as Mr Spence's flowers keep
blooming, the prizes will no doubt keep coming -- not to mention the
numerous compliments and thanks from commuters offered a little grace in
the hassle of their daily lives. Meanwhile the trains -- Toytown
Sprinters and the occasional svelte 125 -- come and go.

Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle (rental, cert 15)
DOROTHY Parker was one of those evanescent 1930s American literary
figures who had the misfortune to outlive their fame. A Jazz Age flapper
whose brittle witticisms didn't wear well through the earnestness of the
1940s and 1950s, her anorexically slim poetry and prose (Parker's
brilliance in talk was never quite reproduced in the over-polished
miniatures of her writing) had to wait until the 1970s to gain cult
status, by which time their author had drunk herself miserably to death,
obscure and alone.
She was always more famous for what she was than for what she did, a
zany, hard-drinking broad -- Sally Bowles with brains and a cutting line
in repartee -- who knew everybody who was anybody, and in particular the
smart-ass glitterati (Robert Benchley, H L Mencken, James Thurber, all
that gang) who hung out at the Algonquin Hotel in New York, polishing
their aphorisms.
This affectionate biopic by Alan Rudolph recreates that hothouse
milieu to entertaining and stylish effect, scoring high on period
atmosphere and set dressing, if less well on narrative flow. Jennifer
Jason Leigh's leading performance captures the sadness and sensitivity
behind Parker's wisecracking raunchiness, while giving full value to her
crackerjack one-liners and her brisk, sassy sexuality -- although more
should have been made of her fiery left-wing politics, which were a
large part of the reason why so many of her old friends dropped her when
she hit the slide.
It won't mean much to anyone who doesn't already know all about
Dorothy Parker, but for those who do, it's a must.
CHINA MOON (rental, cert 18).
We're in familiar but still frequently rewarding guilty-lovers
thriller territory here, round about the same postcode as Double
Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice. There's the lickerish
young wife (Madeleine Stowe), the unsympathetic husband (Charles Dance),
and -- crucial genre element -- the sad-sack, sex-stunned loverboy (Ed
Harris). What intensifies the atmosphere of corruption and doom this
time around is that Harris isn't a lounge lizard or a dumb drifter, but
a clean, straight-arrow homicide cop; which makes his collusion in
Dance's death all the dizzier a fall from grace.
Director John Bailey piles on the noir atmosphere (it rains a lot) as
the plot skids and lurches towards the cemetery, picking up speed all
the way, while the superb character actor Ed Harris plays a blinder in a
rare starring role.
ULYSSES (retail, Lumiere, #9.99, cert 18).
James Joyce's mighty modernist novel about a day in Edwardian Dublin
is completely unfilmable, and just to prove it, Joseph Strick made a
film of it in 1967. It's not so much a reduction of the book as a set of
snapshots therefrom, dividing most of its attention between the
relationship between melancholy cuckold Leopold Bloom (Milo O'Shea) and
his wife Molly (Barbara Jefford) and the hallucinatory nightmare scenes
in the brothel in Nighttown; Joyce's own alter-ego, the student Stephen
Dedalus (Maurice Roeves) doesn't get much of a look-in. No substitute
for wading through the book, but full of striking images and good fun
for Joyce buffs.

Mungo Campbell takes a look at the work of an artist who was ever the
outsider
THE list of Scottish artists born in the first decade of the
nineteenth century is an impressive one. Among such names as William
Dyce, Thomas Duncan, David Octavius Hill, and Robert Scott Lauder is
another, less well-known but equally remarkable. David Scott was a close
friend of many of the leading artists of Scotland during the first half
of the century. He was admired among a wider circle, beyond the capital,
but remained an outsider throughout his short life (1806-1849), both as
a personality and as a painter.
He has never been entirely forgotten. His importance has always been
recognised although not always understood and his extraordinary
imagination frequently remarked upon, if as frequently reviled. David
Scott had no pupils or followers and he rarely managed to sell his
pictures. Our knowledge of Scott's life is largely dependent on the
hagiographic Memoir published in 1850 by his younger brother, the
painter William Bell Scott.
Scott's father, Robert, was an engraver. The circumstances of the
Scott family undoubtedly had a considerable influence on his
personality. Four elder brothers died within a year of David's birth and
although there were three further children, all the Scott children lived
with a profound awareness of the family loss. Childhood evenings were
spent in silent study, reading or copying engravings, including William
Blake's illustrations to Blair's The Grave. Blake's ideas had a powerful
influence on David's art.
After studying at the Trustees' Academy, Scott was employed for a time
in his father's engraving workshop. He preferred life drawing and
painting, neither of which he had studied formally. Scott exhibited his
first canvas, The Hopes of Genius Dispelled by Death, at the Royal
Institution in 1828 and was invited by his fellow artists to join the
newly founded breakaway Scottish Academy.
Ironically, despite Scott's disillusionment with his father's
engraving business, his most successful works were the series of
imaginative illustrations produced during the 1830s and 1840s. The
finest are the engravings for the first set of illustrations ever
produced for The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Scott sent his prints to
Coleridge in 1831 only to discover that the poet, who admired them
greatly, could not support the publication of any further editions of
his work. They finally appeared in 1837.
Scott's stay in Italy from August 1832 until February 1834, visiting
Venice in the company of William Dyce, was one of the most artistically
and personally liberating experiences of his life. He returned to
Edinburgh and, apart from a brief visit to Paris in 1837 with his
brother, he rarely left Scotland again. Much of the remainder of his
career was marked by a series of ambitious canvases, including The Agony
of Discord or the Household Gods Destroyed (lost), and the vast Vasco da
Gama Passing the Cape of Good Hope (Trinity House, Leith), which cost
much emotional energy and which, when exhibited, earned neither praise
nor money.
The early 1840s marked a rapid decline in Scott's morale. His entries
for the great competition to decorate the interiors of the new Houses of
Parliament in London caused his brother William to despair when, in
1843, he saw their ''wilfully unelaborated character, antagonistic to
the prevailing and expected method''. In the same year, his candidature
for the post of Master of the Trustees' Academy was passed over in
favour of Thomas Duncan. Never of a strong constitution, Scott died at
the age of 43 scarcely humoured by the news that the Vasco da Gama had
been purchased by public subscription and presented to Trinity House,
Leith, the first time that this had happened in Scotland.
In writing about Scott there is always an element of embarking on an
apologia, explaining as well as excusing. It was not his way to make
things easy for himself or for those around him and in setting out to
paint ''high art'' he did nothing to make his pictures accessible. If
David Scott is not a central figure in the history of Scottish painting,
then he is certainly a remarkable one.

With censor systems easing parents' fears over children accessing
sexual and disturbing material on the Internet, Joe Donnelly discovers
that television censorship could be next
AT last, the forgotten generation in the computing age, the parents
who actually buy the things, are getting a say as to what comes down the
line and appears on screens.
The superconducting world seems to have become aware of concerns over
the amount of explicit, sexual, and violent material which can be
dredged up on the net. Now that parents are aware of what their children
can hook into, they want some level of control.
Companies aware of parental anxieties are bringing out new censor
systems which, like telephone call barring (which prevents youngsters
accessing porn and chatlines), can let parents decide areas of the
Internet where their children are forbidden to go.
Such systems will soon be available for ordinary television too if, as
is expected, Britain follows the US lead.
With PCs now part of the culture, and a fixture in millions of homes,
a factor which has led to the colossal boom in Internet use, vast
amounts of information are available via modem, and while much of it can
be fascinating and plenty of it merely company promotional material,
there is still a percentage catering to the weird, the strange, and
sometimes the downright perverted.
In the dozens of new Internet glossy magazines which have recently
been launched to cater to netsurfers, web addresses for porn -- soft and
hard -- are easily found.
A few keystrokes can access any user to Cyber-sex Toys, or Condom
Country, where sex aids are described and can be ordered. Penthouse and
Playboy magazines -- and many more -- have their own web sites. On the
internet, the innocent can dial up live nude video teleconferencing, a
witchcraft site, Satanism information, and even a magazine devoted to
the sexual attractions and preferences of extremely obese people.
Apart from pornography and adult material -- several hundred
pornographic titles are available on the web -- parents might also be
concerned that children can get information on bomb-making and recipes
for napalm from such providers as the Anarchist's Cookbook.
Now they can get some measure of control from WinWatch Home, the
recently launched censoring and administration package. The system,
devised and produced by Humphries and Wohlran and Associates Ltd,
business software specialists, can automatically censor any area of the
Internet, so preventing children gaining access to anything considered
undesirable.
Added to the censorship is a timekeeping facility which restricts the
usage on a daily and weekly basis and can even target the use to
cheap-call periods. The system can also tell parents which other
programs have been run on a PC, for how long, and which files were
accessed. The system allows anxious parents concerned about the amount
of computer time to identify whether the machine was used for homework
or just playing games.
US company Surfwatch Software has come up with a similar censorship
system which lets parents block access to 250 newsgroups currently
available on the Internet which contain both text and visual images on
topics such as bestiality, bondage, and paedophilia. Surfwatch consider
their blocking program will be ideal for schools who are increasing the
Internet access for lessons.
Because new sites are constantly launched on the web, Surfwatch also
offers a subscription service which automatically updates blocked sites.
Apart from the Internet, parents are also more anxious about the
amount of violence and sex available through normal television channels.
In the United States, they will soon be able to programme television
sets to shield children from the worst of it, following a government
vote to put a censor chip in all new television sets.
Called the V-Chip, it allows parents to block certain categories of
programmes, despite tremendous opposition from broadcasters concerned
about the loss of advertising revenue from companies who might refuse to
buy air-time in programmes which might be call-barred.
Under the system, broadcasters would have to rate their programmes
according to the amount of sex and violence they contain. The
censor-rating would be broadcast at the same time as the programme,
picked up and decoded by the V-chip which would then blank out the
programme. In the States, television manufacturers already have to
include a chip which displays subtitles for the deaf, so the inclusion
of the censor technology is expected to be cheap and easy.
A similar system could be in the UK in only a couple of years, giving
parents the option, along with the censorship of the Internet, to decide
what material comes into the home, rather than relying on
government-inspired ''watershed'' times or the morals of broadcasters.
The Winwatch Home guard is available from Crown Computer products for
#46.99. Surfwatch Software plans to be distributing in the UK soon.

* LOGITECH has announced a new technology for the mouse and trackball
market. Marble Sensing Technology for screen pointing devices is
modelled after natural structures and takes the 30-year-old computer
mouse a few more steps up the evolutionary ladder.
The ''biologically inspired'' principle of MST is based on the optical
measurement of movement where a camera measures a shift in a picture and
evaluates the change. This evaluation takes place in the heart of the
sensor and according to Logitech, it allows input units to function
without wear and tear. In future, it adds, because rollers inside the
mouse are no longer required, trackball and mouse function will not be
impaired by dust, resulting in cursors sticking. The company have
patented the new technology and expect to market it soon.
* CONNECTIX Corporation has launched a RAM doubler for Windows, a
memory management utility which, they say installs in seconds and
dramatically improves PC performance and reliability. By effectively
doubling available memory the system allows PC users to run more
applications simultaneously, cuts crashing tendency and provides more
memory to network users. Out now, the system is selling for #69.95.

I HAVE no typical day, or eating pattern. This may be unhealthy but
like all robust people I abuse my good fortune!
When I'm home breakfast is usually yoghurt, fruit, and coffee. At
breakfast meetings, orange juice, cereal, toast and a boiled egg . . .
almost never done as I like them but the potential that it might be is
exciting. On a plane I'll eat most of what's going and must be one of
the few who likes airline meals.
Lunch might be a Boots or M&amp;S sandwich at my desk, or salad or pasta
if I'm meeting someone. I rarely eat desserts, but enjoy reading the
menus. I love cheese -- but try not to over-indulge.
I love soup -- chilled vichyssoise or gazpacho in summer, anything
hearty in winter. I eat less and less meat for reasons of taste and
digestion than ethical ones. Any rice dish (except pudding) is a joy.
Dinner is much like lunch but I'll take a glass or two of wine -- at
the moment I'm on a Chardonnay kick.
I don't graze between meals. My rogue delights: fish and chips,
Vietnamese noodles, spring rolls, peas and spinach in any form, diet
Pepsi. I enjoy cooking but rarely do it and am a great believer in big
dinner parties.
And I do like picnics no matter the weather after a lifetime of
Scottish holidays. When you're really hungry after a good walk into the
rain, no food on earth could be better than a roll and cheddar, or pie
and a Granny Smith.

* IT can be a long and dangerous journey from the nesting burrow to
the sea for a family of shelduck. Even if your parents have chosen
somewhere more sensible to nest than the Sidlaws or Cairnsmore of Fleet,
there are plenty of terrestrial and aerial predators hungry for a fat
little striped duckling. Then your parents have a tendency to rush off
to fight the neighbours, leaving you defenceless. At least when you
reach salt water your skilful diving will protect you from most dangers.
Things don't improve. In mid-July, often before you can fly, nearly
all the grown-ups leave you in your creche, with a few remaining behind
as guards, and fly off to Heligoland near Germany for the month of
August to moult in the safety of the open Wadden Sea. At least some of
the younger adults have recently had the sense to go to Grangemouth
instead, where more than 4000 of them can be seen off Kinneil, upending
for food in a dense, flightless mass.
The pretty ducklings grow into striking adults. Unusually for ducks,
the sexes are alike: white with green heads and red bills, an orange
ring round the breast and dark green and pied wings. Their upright
carriage and large size has led them to be commonly seen as a kind of
goose. They brighten the open mudflats where they feed on a little
marine mollusc, or the freshwater grasses where they poke for worms.
However for much of the winter they are making their way back from the
moulting grounds to their nest sites. They will be back on south and
east Scottish foreshores soon.
Where are last year's ducklings now? They have moved off in different
directions, to scatter their genes when they are two years old and do to
their own stripy ducklings what their parents did to them.

INDOOR displays of ''Paper Whites'' look good in glass tanks of
pebbles. Bulbs appreciate a sprinkling of bone-meal in the soil and a
clearing of weeds. A good spread of mulch after watering will ensure
good results. Don't mow the grass in naturalized lawns until at least
six weeks after flowering to ensure the bulbs replenish their goodness.
When storing bulbs, take them out of plastic bags, and make sure they
are kept cool and dry. A firm, healthy bulb is better than a large,
light one. Avoid those that show any signs of damage of mildew.
For a temporary display in the herbaceous border or shrubberies, you
could try using one of the pots used for marginal planting by ponds.
These have sides of mesh and ensure adequate drainage and ease of
lifting. As a cut flower, the sap of daffs can kill other flowers in the
arrangement. To prevent this leave them in a bucket of water for 12
hours before arranging.

Eileen Crone looks forward to spring, and her garden being the host of
golden daffodils
TRADITIONALLY this is the time of year when we are clearing out
borders and the vegetable patch, improving the soil, maintaining the
lawn and generally reassessing the garden after the bounties of summer.
Perhaps thoughts have drifted on to winter and spring and you will be
planning your bulb displays. Even if there is strict colour themes in
the garden, nothing cheers after a cold, dark winter like the brilliance
of bright yellow daffodils.
This is the time of year to plant daffodils as they enjoy making roots
early and benefit from a long growing season. The minute you plunge them
in, the roots are beginning to develop.
There are the miniatures like the old fashioned hoop-petticoat
Narcissus bulbicodium (good for rockeries or sink gardens teamed with
dwarf conifers or heathers), the heady perfume of the early-flowering
''Paper Whites'', the rose-like scent of ''Sweet Charity'' and the
stylish white-on-white of ''Dallas'' or ''Cushendall''. For refined
orange-blossom scent there are the jonquils, with clusters of small,
golden-yellow, short-cupped flowers on 12-inch stems.
Petals can be double-flowered, bunch-flowered, reflexed, large-cupped,
small-cupped or large-trumpeted. Colours vary from white/green,
pink-tinged, the pale yellows and lemons to deep sunshine yellow. Some
have red centres such as late-flowering Pheasant's eye.
The Royal Horticultural Society Daffodil Register lists 25,000 names,
with about 300 new ones every year. The newest, most desirable varieties
can fetch up to #75 a bulb from specialist nurseries. Common varieties
such as ''Ice Follies'' are reasonably cheap from garden centres.
Now with micro-propogation new varieties are arriving on the market
quicker and cheaper. By chipping the bulb you can get eight to 16 bulbs
in half the time. The old method of division takes 25 years to develop a
new variety to the point where it can be marketed.
Other interesting varieties are the reversed bi-colours with yellow
petals and white trumpets or split corona types where the trumpet is in
three or six sections. The RHS The Plant Finder lists new and unusual
varieties. The Lent Lily, the native wild daff can be found this way.
Daffodils are good bulbs to naturalize. Bulbs can be left in place to
grow, multiply and flower for years. General guidlines say to plant to
two times their own depth and more in light soils. However, planting
from six to 12 inches deep for larger bulbs and about three inches from
smaller varieties improves frost protection and also supports the longer
stemmed, larger flowered varieties. You could also plant ''in layers''
with other types of bulbs for continued interest.
Daffodils look best in a bold display, not dotted around sparsely. It
is best not to be too stingy on numbers. Try not to plant in rigid
geometric shapes or rows. The natural look of uneven edges is what to
aim for. Throw your bulbs at random, and plant where they fall. A
hand-held trowel does a good job or there are specialist bulb planters
that take out a complete plug of soil. These are particularly good if
you are trying to naturalize the flowers in a lawn.

Dead elms stand out like skeletons, stripped of leaves and bark
Elms have graced Scotland for generations. Now, in a major new
enviromental threat, the Dutch elm disease which ravaged the South of
England 20 years ago is sweeping the country. Joe Donnelly reports
IN the old Ramshorn Churchyard, a restful spot just behind The Herald
offices in Albion Street, a tree is on the point of death.
In the little cemetery where the merchants of this Merchant City lie
shaded by tall trunks and a green canopy, a one-sided battle is nearing
its conclusion as the leaves on a magnificent elm tree wither and die.
Within a few weeks it will be dead.
On either side, its neighbours, lush and green today, are doomed.
There's a kestrel's nest in a shaded fork again this year which has seen
three chicks hatch, fledge, and fly. It won't be used next year because
there won't be any shade. Most of the trees here will be dead this year
or the next.
In George Square, another elm is beginning to wither. In a month or
so, the parks department will be felling the carcasses and carting off
dry logs. They'll replant with sycamore or maple or cherry, but the
sturdy elm, favourite of the old Victorians and town and city fathers
over the country, will be lost.
In parks and gardens, throughout Scotland the story is the same. An
insidious epidemic is wiping out thousands, if not millions, of trees
which have shaded and sheltered us since childhood.
This is Dutch elm disease. It is not Dutch, but it kills elms, one of
the best growing trees in Britain, a producer of fine wood prized by
cabinetmakers and carvers alike and of intricately grained burrwood
valued by lathe turners for its decorative qualities. For many years the
disease was mainly confined to southern Britain where it devastated
forests of lowlands elms which were introduced to Britain before the
Romans.
Since the epidemic of the late sixties, however, it has killed about
30 million trees, some of them 200 old, and it has cut a swathe through
the native elm population, the Scotch or Wych Elm, changing the face of
our parklands and our broad-leaved forests. So far, only the Moray Firth
and places north of the Great Glen have escaped. In the latest flare-up,
since 1990, it is killing countless trees every week. The toll is now
colossal.
Because of its name, most people think of Dutch elm disease as a
foreign blight, but the title only reflects the fact that much research
was carried out in the Netherlands. It is not merely a British plague,
for it has caused huge damage in Europe and America. But it is now a
serious Scottish epidemic and there is no cure, as yet.
For most people it's also a vague tree-flu, but it's not. Now is the
best, or rather the easiest, time to see its effects, especially in the
Clydeside conurbation.
In late summer and early autumn, when trees still have their full
canopy of foliage cover, it's the bare one among them that's the elm --
and it's dead.
Down Great Western Road and continuing along Loch Lomondside, the
effects, if you look, are quite startling. In Stirling, Renfrew, and in
Ayrshire the evidence is just as strong. No-one travelling by car or
train can miss them, small islands of winter bleakness in summertime.
Stark against the heavy dark foliage, the dead elms stand out like
skeletons, stripped of leaves and bark. In the midst of life they are in
death. Dead elms line our streets and our hillsides, waiting to rot and
fall. Trees which have withstood gales and storms for more than a
century, and have seen human generations in and out, seen politicians
come and go, industries rise and decline, now wither and die in the
space of weeks. For something normally as long-lived as a tree, it's the
arboreal equivalent of a coronary, or maybe even pneumonic plague,
because it's caused by an infection, rather than the clogging of the
respiratory system.
According to the Forestry Commission's research division, Dutch elm is
one of the most serious tree diseases in the world. It's caused by a
fungus which in turn is spread by small beetles.
Commission research shows that in the seventies it caused a major
environmental disaster when it killed millions of elms down south, but
now it's reappearing in elms that have grown up in the aftermath of that
epidemic.
Researchers John Gibbs, Clive Brasier, and Joan Webber say it is now
making inroads into the remaining elm populations of northern Britain
and is extending even further north.
The elm-bark beetles carry the fungal infection on their feet and when
they feed on the ends of twigs, they infect the tree. The infected parts
wilt and the tree, weakened by disease, becomes a breeding site for the
beetles whose larvae develop under the bark. When they pupate, to
develop into adult beetles, the fungus fruits and when the beetles fly
off to find another tree, they carry the disease with them. It's only
when the dead tree sheds its bark that it becomes unappetising to beetle
or fungus, but by then the damage is long done.
The research division report says the major epidemic was a result of
the introduction of a severely pathogenic form of the disease from
infected logs imported from Canada, but the plague itself is probably a
native of the Himalayas, and that is where the hope for a cure lies.
More on that later.
The fact that Scotland is generally colder than England has been a
factor in slowing the forward and northward march for the disease, for a
number of good reasons. First, a rival fungus, Phomopsis oblonga,
growing in the bark can prevent successful breeding of the beetle
colonies, and later, the hatched adults need temperatures of at least 18
degrees before they can take flight.
If it's too cold, they can't fly and that means they can't spread
quickly. Also, if they can't fly, there's a chance that something will
come along and eat them. The bad news is that Phomopsis oblonga grows
best in cooler damper conditions, which have been absent this summer and
the previous one, and the temperatures have been consistently higher
than 18 degrees for much of the summer. The spread of this killer
disease will be rampant.
Gibbs, Brasier, and Webber say that the beetles have natural enemies
which reduce their numbers, including woodpeckers, deadly fungus which
kills them, and hymenopteran wasps which lay their eggs directly on to
or into the wood-boring grubs to let their larvae eat them from within.
Unfortunately the populations of all three in Scotland are too small,
and under the new epidemic conditions, such a vast amount of elm-killing
beetles are hatching that the woodpeckers and wasps have little effect.
The only thing that stops the disease is its own deadly success. It
kills elms by the million, and when it has nothing left to feed on, it
dies back. The beetle population crashes, then, when the young trees
begin to mature in 15 to 20 years, it returns to devastate a new
generation. It's believed that it will keep coming back time and again.
There have been various attempts at controlling the infection, none of
which seem to have worked. During the 1970s epidemic, sanitation felling
programmes were instituted under the Dutch Elm Disease (Local
Authorities) Order. It relied on the felling of diseased trees and the
destruction of the bark to eliminate beetle-breeding material. It is
also vital, in specific types of elm, to remove the roots too.
To be successful, sanitation needs a major commitment of effort over
many years and unfortunately few authorities seem to have the depth of
pocket or depth of commitment for that. Fungicidal injections have been
developed, but they are expensive. Biocontrol was tried by the use of
pheromone lures where the beetles are seduced by sexual scents. The
traps were useful only in monitoring the beetle populations (as is the
count of dead trees) but the bark beetle was not for seducing in a big
way.
The only hope now seems to lie in the Himalayas, where Dutch elm
fungus is thought to have evolved and spread to the rest of the world.
For the past 15 years, scientists at the Forestry Authority's research
station in Farnham, Surrey, have been attempting to track down the true
geographical origins of the disease by tracing its spread across Europe,
Asia, and North America. Despite the name, it was long believed that the
plague came from China, until a commission survey eight years ago found
hardly a trace of the disease there.
Dr Clive Brasier, co-author of the report, Dutch Elm Disease in
Britain, has recently reported the discovery of a new form of the fungus
in remote forest areas of the Western Himalayas in India, where,
incidentally, it is believed the other deadly fungus which causes dry
rot, a plague on so many houses in Scotland today, first originated.
''The discovery promises to shed new light on the origins of the
disease,'' he says. ''This will allow us to investigate the link between
our current epidemic and the Himalayan fungus. Most importantly it will
let us see if the form of the fungus causing the present epidemic has
evolved from the Himalayan strain.''
If Brasier and his team can find the natural enemies, or any agent
which inhibits the spread of the killer disease, he may find the
ultimate solution which could break the deadly cycle of infection,
breeding, and re-infection which is wiping out millions of our trees.
There's something sad about the death of any tree, with the exception
only perhaps of those artificial serried ranks of Sitka spruce which
march across much of our landscape today and smother all else. There is
something disturbing in the knowledge that a tree which sheltered our
granny's granny as a wee girl can be killed in the space of a short
summer by something carried on the feet of a little wood-boring beetle.
There is also something melancholy about the fact that a big, silent,
growing, living thing like a tree, planted for the benefit and enjoyment
of us all, will disappear from a corner here, from a row there, changing
our perspective, our view, our expectation of continuity.
They seem to live forever, but, like the elm, they don't. More years
ago than he cares to remember, this writer carved his initials alongside
those of a girl on the curve of a gnarled elm root where we could sit
shaded from peeping eyes. We knew the tree would always bear the
evidence of something a little more incandescent than puppy love. It did
not. Last year it died.
Behind the Herald office, the trees are dying and dying fast as the
plague leaps from one to the other. The kestrels will be forced to seek
another shelter for their chicks. The dead merchants who planted some of
the tall elms will have no shade, and neither will the lunchers seeking
an hour's peace in a city churchyard.
In parks and gardens and avenues throughout Scotland, the dead
branches are becoming all too familiar -- look around and you'll see
them -- as they point at the sky. They will only be camouflaged when
winter strips the leaves from their neighbours. But next year, when the
trees are in full leaf, the dead skeletons will be all too nakedly
visible.
And by next year there will be many, many more of them.

THE creation of the barrel may not have been greeted with the same
club-thumping or foot-stomping as the wheel, but its introduction gave
mankind a means of storing goods such as fish, meat, and water in a
container that could be easily handled.
Coopers were the chaps that made the barrels and the cooperage became
an important part of most breweries, often located on the opposite side
of the courtyard from the brewhouse. Scottish ports and harbours,
especially those associated with the herring industry, also developed a
strong coopering tradition.
Barrels and beer were to enjoy a centuries-long relationship and it
wasn't until the new wheel arrived in the form of a metal cask that
divorce seemed inevitable. However, there are exceptions.
Clive Hollis, who has made a barrel or two in his 50 years in the
business, is one of a diminishing band of about 20 in the country who
are still in rhythm with a nickety nackety, noo, noo, noo. And at
Theakstons brewery in Masham the art of cooperage  is still practised.
The skills that are borne of the cooper may have originated from the
early days of the sailing ships when repairs to the wooden structure had
to be carried out in the course of a voyage. This nautical connection
continues in the workshop. Each cooper has a block, a metre-long pillar
of elm firmly established in the floor, on which to work. The block is
in a berth and the array of tools are in an area known as the locker.
The auger, jigger, firkin croze, adze, flogger, kilderkin croze, and
flagging iron are but some of the instruments employed by the cooper.
All have an ancient appeal and none has been superseded by modern
versions; they are all hand tools driven by manpower and when the
electricity board cuts the supply, the cooper makes do with a ''hey
Willie Wallachy ho John Dougal Alane quo Rushety roo, roo, roo''.
Because of the time taken in certain manufacturing processes, each
cooper will have about five barrels in different stages of production at
the one time. The barrel's life begins with the making of staves, a step
which immediately challenges the coopers' skill. The staves are angled
so that when each is brought together they make a perfect fit. Because
the angles formed are different a template is of no use and judgment of
eye is the all-important factor.
However, in that early nineteenth-century era of invention, progress
was to substitute machine for man and there was a patent registered
where barrels were made by machinery.
But at Masham everything's done by hand and, once cut, the angled
staves are ''raised'' in a cone-shaped truss which is subjected to steam
for 40 minutes. The steam softens the timber ready for bending and as
the hoops are drawn on to the cask the staves close together with a few
grunts and groans to form watertight joints. The cask is then fired,
after which the staves remain bent. Old friends from the locker finish
the barrel with an adzeing cut, crozing cut and chiving cut and heads
made from middles and outside pieces called cants complete the job.
Coopering once attracted may bright lads into apprenticeship but few
breweries require their skills today. Specialised equipment was used to
make the massive barrels that make up the union sets at Marstons brewery
in Burton-on-Trent. However, the brewery employs a cooper and apprentice
to carry out repair and maintenance work.
The next time you roll out the barrel at the Old Bull and Bush raise
your glass to the cooper. And if you are in the Masham area call in at
the brewery where all the coopers' tools and workshop can be viewed and
the skills of the craft explained.

* MITSUBISHI materials in Japan have reversed the dream of turning
base material into gold. They've turned gold into a putty-like clay
which could revolutionise the jewellery market. Using fine gold
particles and an organic binder, it allows designers to work the gold
with their hands. Once they have made a piece of jewellery, the product
is heated, evaporating the binder and leaving only gold. The system
works with silver and gold. This Plasticine, however, is strictly for
very rich kids.
* ENCOURAGING news from the Federal Aviation Administration, the US
equivalent of the CAA. They plan to replace all the old 1960s computers
used in air traffic control, at huge cost. Apparently the system is so
ancient that the electronic brains don't even have microchip processors.
They use valves, like old radios once did. The bad news is that the
system won't be replaced until 1997. Have a good flight!
* AS mobile-phone theft increases, service provider Astec offers a
discourager to phone snatchers. They've started a ''blazing'' service
which will emblazon initials, names, addresses, or even company logos on
mobile telephones. The company plans to extend the service for notebook
PCs and other hi-tech equipment.
* A REVOLUTION in lighting comes from US company Fusion Lighting which
has developed a miniature bulb only a couple of centimetres across with
a huge output equivalent to 250 ordinary 100-watt livingroom bulbs. The
no-filament bulb heats sulphur by microwaves, converting energy to light
more efficiently than even fluorescent tubes, and emits something very
similar to daylight. Fusion's first plug-in will be in the Smithsonian
space-hall where they will replace almost 100 industrial lights with
just three of theirs.
* APPLE Computers are boasting high-performance results in comparative
tests between their new Power Macintosh systems and Pentium Windows
based PCs. According to a study completed by CAS, Competitive Assessment
services, the Mac systems, from the 7200 to the 8500, outperformed the
Pentium by up to 44%. The new computers offer the same architecture
found in the 9500 which was introduced this summer and billed as the
world's fastest PC. Using Apple's new-generation 604 processor, the Macs
graphics and publishing applications tested faster than the rival
equivalent.
* A SPEECH and hearing centre in Jerusalem is offering computer-aided
therapy designed to help stutterers. The Hadassah Hospital offers a
three-week intensive course for people afflicted with a stammer which
involves them learning a new way to speak. Called Dr Fluency, it's
designed by a former impediment bearer whose experience led him to
design a computer program to help fellow sufferers practice what they
have learned on the course. They can listen to themselves and then
receive objective feedback from the computer.
* PHILIPS have secured a contract to supply a complete digital
broadcast system for the new space vehicles orbited by SES, the Societe
Europeenne des Satellites who operate the Astra satellites.
The new orbiter, the first of which is due for launch next month, will
enable broadcasters to transmit high-quality digital television across
Europe and each Astra transponder will be capable of simultaneous
beaming of several broadcast services for individual reception as well
as cable redistribution.

NOT all Italian vineyards need Australian flying wine doctors to help
them improve their quality. Most, indeed, are commendably continuing to
produce wines to suit Italian priorities rather than those of the
British supermarkets. Of the latest Italian wines that really have the
flavour of Italy, one of the nicest and most unusual I have encountered
is a white Vermentino di Sardegna, which Oddbins are selling for #3.79 a
bottle.
Though a very light specimen of its kind -- a mere 10.5% proof -- it
has such a fresh, bright taste that you could easily mistake it for
something stronger. If your experience of Italy's island wines has been,
until now, disappointing, then here is another reason to sample this
one. There is nothing tired or oxidised about the 1994 vintage -- not
yet anyway -- and it possesses that slight Italian prickle which, in
warm weather, makes it all the more appetising.
''Before my first visit to Sardinia,'' says Victor Hazan -- who is as
expert on Italian wine as his wife, Marcella, is on Italian food -- ''I
had been drinking, on the mainland, a crisp, perfectly balanced, light
Sardinian wine called Vermentino di Alghero. The morning I landed in
Cagliari, the island's major city, my first order of business, after a
brisk, exploratory walk, was lunch. With it I asked for a bottle of
Vermentino . . .''
Clearly, he had his priorities right. The Oddbins version may not be a
top-class Vermentino -- at such a price you could not expect it to be --
but it is good enough to make you want to look out for it again, just as
Hazan did. It is also estate-bottled, in the sense that its producers,
Sella and Mosca, own what is a genuine estate, albeit a very large one,
which grows its own grapes and bottles its own wine.
Founded almost a century ago by an engineer, Signor Sella, and a
lawyer, Signor Mosca, both of them from Piedmont, the firm grew from
unpromising beginnings in a terrain of swamp and brushland to become
Sardinia's leading wine company. But Cagliari, the scene in
south-eastern Sardinia of one of England's grosser World Cup intrusions,
is not where it is based. Indeed, facing westwards towards Spain, it is
located at the opposite end of the island, and an air of Spanishness is
said to hang so strongly over the buildings and dialect of the town of
Alghero that it has been nicknamed Barcelonetta.
Though some people have claimed to detect a hint of Spain in the wine
-- whose grape type was imported from there three centuries ago -- there
is nothing oaky about the flavour, which seems quite individual. If
Oddbins score a hit with it, let us hope they go on to bring us Sella
and Mosca's higher-profile -- and inevitably slightly dearer -- Torbato
Secco.
To track down the richer and more idiosyncratic Vernaccia di Oristano,
otherwise known as ''Sardinian Gold'', we would have to head for a
specialist firm such as Valvona and Crolla in Edinburgh, for this is
certainly an acquired (as well as expensive) taste. A good bottle of it,
however, is a remarkable experience. Like Lacryma Christi, it is said to
have originated in the shedding of holy tears -- not Christ's in this
case, but those of St Jiustina, who wept over the plight of the
malaria-ridden area where, as a result, the vines began to grow.
Be that as it may, the taste is quite different from that of the more
familiar Vernaccia di San Gimignano from Tuscany, and the process by
which it is made in open casks sounds bizarre to say the least. But the
result is a great, and in Britain at least, quite uncommon apperitif,
which at 15% proof is suggestive of a fine dry sherry, worth trying on
your friends.
An eight-year-old vintage produced by Sella and Mosca can be bought
from Valvona and Crolla for #8.99.

Coffee, so often a bitter postscript can, in the right hands, be a
round of applause says Conrad Wilson.
THE first whiff of Gauloises continues (though not to the degree it
once did) to tell you that you have arrived in France, so the first gulp
of espresso, and its accompanying aroma, tells you that you have reached
Italy. But why does the magic of good Italian coffee fail to transfer to
Britain? I used to think it had something to do with the water, since
all the best brands of Italian coffee are available here. But now I
suspect that, in restaurants and cafes at least, it has more to do with
technique and quality control.
British restaurants, for a start, don't like serving espresso, because
it is labour-intensive and each cup has to be made individually. They
much prefer the filter systems, such as Cona, whereby vast quantities of
coffee can be made at one time. There is nothing wrong with Cona, except
for the fact that it lends itself to abuse. The coffee, sometimes
prepared hours before customers arrive, sits stewing on a hotplate
until, by the time it is needed, it is disgustingly undrinkable. Because
this is what seems to happen almost everywhere in Scotland, I have given
up drinking coffee in restaurants here, unless I know how and when it
has been made.
Am I fussy? Yes, of course, because I happen to love good coffee and
enjoy the perfectly simple rituals involved in making it. Safer than
filter coffee in a restaurant, though not necessarily better, is the use
of a cafetiere -- the method that involves a glass coffee pot fitted
with a plunger to separate the coffee grains from the hot water. Many
people dislike this method because the coffee cools quickly, but if it
is drunk fast and fresh -- which all coffee should be -- there is no
problem.
Restaurants dislike it for other reasons, once again because the pots
of coffee have to be prepared individually and because the process is
more expensive than filter. Since, however, the price is usually passed
on to the customer (a pot for two people often costing #3 or #4), this
seems not much of a reason for refusing to use cafetieres. But there is,
in my experience, another drawback about the use of this excellent
system of coffee making, which is that restaurants so often serve
inferior industrial coffee blends. Stewed in filter coffee pots, this
does not matter greatly -- all coffee tastes horrible that way. Served
fresh in a cafetiere, on the other hand, it matters very much,
especially if the ground coffee is already stale, which it is quite
likely to be.
Where restaurants can -- if they desire -- really score over domestic
coffee making is in the use of espresso machines. Few households have
the money or space for the big professional machines that function so
much better than the little ones intended for domestic use. But then,
few restaurants are prepared to train their staff to use them properly,
with the result that the customer receives what looks like a cup of
black treacle.
But there is now, at last, in Glasgow a place that does things right.
It is the Caffe Roberta (note the proper Italian spelling), conveniently
positioned opposite Central Station. It is an offshoot of an authentic
Italian caffe of the same name in Modena, home of Pavarotti in the heart
of Reggio Emilia, a region entirely devoted to the art of good eating.
Its staff are properly trained, some of them in Italy. It uses its own
excellent coffee blend. It has its own superb coffee machine that not
only hisses and steams but actually -- thanks to the devotion with which
it is used -- produces a superb cup of coffee. The espresso is small and
intense. The cappuccino really tastes of coffee. The macchiato -- which
is an espresso with a dash of cappuccino froth on top -- is
sensationally correct.
So, indeed, is the corretto, which is ''correct'' in a different
sense, in that it is laced with grappa.
But what makes the Caffe Roberta even more enjoyable is that its
ambience is right. It doesn't just look like an Italian caffe, or a
Scottish-Italian version of an Italian caffe. It is studiously
authentic, as good an example as you are likely to get in this country
of the real thing. Which means that, in addition to the tiled floor, the
high counters, the long bar and terracotta-coloured walls, there is
freshly-squeezed orange juice that is genuinely freshly squeezed, not
merely poured from a carton declaring the contents to be ''freshly
squeezed'' -- a contradiction in terms if ever there was one.
The Caffe Roberta also serves brilliantly authentic toasted panini and
other breads, cold meats, salads, dishes of the day, bottled Italian
beers, and wines by the glass -- the house white is a good Trentino
Chardonnay.
It's open for breakfast too. If the Caffe Roberta succeeds, as it
deserves, there are plans to open branches in Edinburgh and elsewhere in
Scotland.

I BLAME Robert Burns -- and the Royal High School of Edinburgh -- for
my fascination with wildflowers. As a boy, floundering amid unconjugated
verbs, I was told to write an essay about Scotia's Bard, based on one of
his poems. I chose To A Mountain Daisy. Much to everyone's astonishment,
my own included, I captured third place in the Scottish Schools Burns
Competition.
It instilled in me an enduring love of wildflowers. Burns wrote the
poem in 1786, after turning down a mountain daisy with his plough:
''Wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower, Thou's met me in an evil hour; For
I maun crush amang the stoure the slender stem: To Spare thee now is
past my pow'r, Thou bonie gem.''
Today, I am reasonably botanically-literate because of the interest my
wife, Ann, has in wildflowers. Over the years she tutored me;
classifying plants, explaining their habitats, likes and dislikes, their
environmental proclivities. Being able to name what we see enhances our
enjoyment and understanding of our natural heritage.
Which is the principal aim of the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT)
devoted to the conservation and protection of Scotland's unique,
irreplaceable environment. Robbie Burns would have approved -- mightily.
Wildflowers, because they are perhaps taken for granted, are under
threat. . They live in an intimate, private world of supreme beauty,
millions of years old. All you need to do to enjoy wildflowers is to
walk and look. Wander the banks of the Clyde in Glasgow to find
primrose, lesser celandine, meadow buttercup, fox-and-cubs, and white
clover; explore the wilderness plantation north of Bishopbriggs, near
the line of the Romans' Antonine Wall to see wood sorrel and violet;
climb the Strathblane Hills to look for milkwort, tormentil, bog
ashpodel, bugle and lousewort.
The excellent SWT Falls of Clyde nature reserve, near New Lanark, is
also a good place for wildflower expeditions.
Even in the centre of Glasgow itself, wildflowers abound, including
two species of a spectacular orchid, broad-leaved helleborine, common to
many gardens and parks; also groundsel, greater plaintain, knotweed,
ground elder, annual meadow grass, meadow thistle, yarrow, and the rare
Austrian yellowcress.
Pack a good reference book. I invariably carry a copy of The
Wildflowers of Britain and Northern Europe, by Richard &amp; Alistair Fitter
and Marjorie Blamey, published by Collins, with more than 1200 colour
illustrations. Another useful publication, by Richard Fitter &amp; David
McClintock, is the Collins Pocket Guide to Wild Flowers. Take the book
to the plant -- not the plant to the book. Never pick wild flowers.
Scotland has a wide range of wildflowers, including three rare
saxifrages which grow in an inaccessible gully in Glen Nevis near Fort
William: drooping saxifrage, Highland saxifrage, and tufted saxifrage.
Some of Scotland's greatest wildflower treasures grow in the narrow,
limestone seam that extends from Broadford on Skye to Durness in
Sutherland: the wonderful plants by the Tralagill Burn in Assynt:
mountain willow, whortle-leaved willow, holly fern, stone bramble, frog
orchid; mountain aven, mountain everlasting and myriad orchids by the
limestone lochs of Durness: Lanlish, Caladail, Croispol and Borralie.
My favourite wildflower is more obvious: bell heather, with its
magenta-coloured flowers and dark green leaves. Our greatest living
Scottish poet, Norman MacCaig, sings of bell heather today: ''A modest
immodesty is a good thing, Little blaze of blue on a rock face. I'll try
it myself. Will the bees come, The wild bees, with their white noses?''

IT looks as if the cause of those mysterious crop circles was caught
in the act, but no, despite appearances, this is no alien. This is the
forefront of modern farming, using a new hi-tech gadget designed at the
Silsoe Research Institute.
It's a targeting system for weeds, developed after scientists
discovered that weeds like couch and blackgrass, which cut down on
profitability, tend to grow in patches and that the patches are
relatively stable from season to season.
Rather than spread weedkillers all over the fields, it's cheaper, and
more environmentally friendly to target the weed patches directly.
The simplest method would be to turn on a conventional sprayer when
the weed patch is under the mechanical boom, but that would also need
constant vigilance, and small patches would be missed, allowing them to
recur as bigger weed patches in future years.
At Silsoe, the scientists have developed this patch sprayer which
incorporates an injection metering system to allow a different dose rate
or mixture of weedkillers. A cropsman simply strolls through the field,
logging individual clumps of weeds into a computer system which is fed
to the tractor-mounted spray.
The field walker logs the information which is then targeted by a
satellite-based global positioning system which can pinpoint weed
patches less than six feet wide from orbit. The positions of weeds for
killing are entered directly on to a map in a small hand-held computer,
and the satellite system lets the machine know where and when to spray,
and how much herbicide a patch needs.
Remember when it was all done by hand and hoe?
The thought occurs, however, that the cause of crop circles might be
farmers without this new weedkilling gadget. Maybe they've just been
trying to flatten them.

Who's the big woman with the wee woman fron Sottish Women? Good
heavens, it's Irene, and Ann Donald bumped into her when she joined Kaye
Adams for a look around her West End Flat
ON ENTERING TV journalist Kaye Adams's hi-tech kitchen I come face to
face with her household companion, Irene. Irene is around 7ft tall and
just about the same again in girth. Dressed in garishly loud flowery
dress, replete with floppy sunhat and clutching on to her gargantuan
handbag she throws me a friendly if rather fixed grin from her gaping
mouth. Every inch the brash Beryl Cook cliche of roly-poly womanhood,
Irene was rescued by Adams from a near-death experience after fulfilling
her stationary post in the sandpit at the Glasgow Garden Festival in
1988.
Irene, composed of chicken wire and papier mache, would now be a soggy
mass of pulp were it not for Adams's charitable intervention. ''It was
my first job at STV,'' explains Adams of her salad days covering the
Festival, ''and Irene and her male counterpart -- the couple are now
unfortunately separated -- were always there. So when I heard that
nobody had bought her at the auction they held afterwards and she had
been consigned to storage, I put in a bid.''
Irene is only one of the unusual interior features of the Scottish
Women presenter's top-floor abode in Glasgow's West End. Just off the
hall a raised circular alcove has been converted into a small dining
area where guests feast not only on the food, one imagines, but also on
the bordello atmosphere of colour-washed blood-red walls decorated by
bow-and-arrow-wielding cherubs the size of small children. This
sumptuous setting is completed by the addition of Rob Mulholland's
tangled metal rods -- on public view to the drinking and eating masses
at Maxa Luna and Bar 91 -- which act as scupltural sentries to the
dining platform. The Mulholland stamp is also visible on the
green-washed walls in the hall where two large and gnarled metallic
candleholders are attached.
As we move through to the large sitting-room, Adams explains that her
''personal tribute to the King's Theatre'', as she jokily dubs the
dramatic interior of the hall, is in fact at odds with her previous
flat's more conservative design. ''I wanted this flat to be as different
as possible from the old one. That was more traditional, calm, sedate
and certainly less colourful than this,'' she says gesticulating towards
the vibrant yellow/ochre sitting-room walls and Bologna red carpet and
blinds. ''It was definitely time for a change.''
Having had access to the converted flat weeks before she moved in last
March Adams then set to work on her ''Mediterranean'' styled favourite
room enlisting the talents of a Scottish Television set designer to
achieve the wash effect on the walls and false ageing and grain of the
skirting. ''This was the first room that I decorated and I had a very
clear idea of what I wanted here,'' she states.
''One of the two focal points of the room is the fabulously styled
cabinet structure that the hi-tech TV rests upon.'' It was designed by
Andrew McDonald, and Adams refers to it as her ''shrine'' at which she
worships daily. The copper front has been artily tarnished by vinegar
while inside hides a dinky video and discreet 80s style music system --
''a 21st birthday present''. A pair of black spaghetti-thin candle
holders stand guard at each side of the cabinet.
The other focal point of the light room is the baby grand piano that
sits romantically at the bay window with an empty whisky decanter and
glasses perched on top. Much as she harbours dreams of playing jazz
classics on sunny days by the open window, Adams has not been able to
squeeze in those essential hours of practice recently. ''I thought that
if I spent all that money on a piano I should take some lessons,'' she
justifies. ''I went to a really good guy for a while who was a jazz
pianist but we just used to sit and get drunk together and I only learnt
to bang out a few tunes -- one of which was Cole Porter's Bewitched,
Bothered and Bewildered.''
The piano is in fact one of the few financial splurges Adams permits
herself alongside the mushrooming number of paintings that find their
way on to her walls. She has an eclectic taste if the mixture of three
discreet figurative and one colourful landscape on her sitting-room
walls is anything to go by. ''I'm not very good at parting with money,''
she concedes. ''Though some people might think that it's the height of
stupidity to buy a baby grand when you don't even play -- and that I
should buy a CD or gadget instead -- but I'd much rather spend money on
the piano or a painting.''
While admiring the wooden coffee table that takes centre stage in the
sitting-room it transpires that Scottish Television newscaster Shereen
Nanjiani has exercised her rights as a critical friend in influencing
the objects that now rest upon it. As the normally unflappable Scottish
Women presenter admits with a defeated sigh, the good-natured ribbing
about her ''pretentious'' architectural books and Everyman classics that
used to be casually scattered around has finally filtered through.
''Anytime Shereen used to come round to my old flat she would
immediately put the books elsewhere and slag the life out of me for
being so pretentious,'' smiles Adams. And did you ever read the books?
''Eh, no . . . not the architectural ones but I did read the classics. I
can read,'' she asserts.
The good-natured Adams has also endured stick for the rather
indistinct photograph of the Right Honourable Mrs Thatcher and herself
that is tucked away behind other photographs of scenes in the life of
Adams the broadcaster and a plethora of family offspring that are dotted
around the sitting-room. ''Everyone thinks that I'm sitting here running
the West End branch of the Young Conservatives. I'm not at all a
Thatcher supporter but that was taken when I was 23 and she was the
first big interview I had done for Central TV so it was momentous for
me. I still shake at the thought of it.''
One other skeleton in Adams's cupboard is revealed as she points out a
dangerously Sellotaped length of flex that runs along the skirting.
''I'm particularly proud of that,'' she notes with satisfaction. It
would appear that at the end of a gruelling day's filming the
high-flying journalist likes nothing better than getting down to a bit
of serious wiring. ''I love it,'' she shrugs, before going on to explain
that she nearly blew herself up after tackling a particularly tricky
earth/neutral/live situation with a pair of scissors while the plug was
still in. ''It's pathetic. Other people do drugs. What does Kaye do? --
a bit of racy wiring.''
I'm not a Thatcher supporter but she was the first big interview I did
so it was momentous for me. I still shake at the thought of it

Benedict Brogan has a few preconceptions shattered on a visit to the
beautiful city of Mount Royal
MY preconceptions of Montreal were fairly standard. To me it had
always been a large Canadian city with some French Canadians in it,
where winter was almost permanent, and where the 1976 Olympics were
played in the world's most expensive building. It was not a place one
associated in any way with Scotland, or Scottish market gardeners and
their extraordinary melons.
The latter is one of the snippets of information gleaned from a
three-day stay in the midst of a tropical heatwave of diabolical,
preconception-bashing proportions, during which I discovered a city
founded by French missionaries and explorers, conquered by the English,
and then built, developed, and transformed into the commercial centre it
remains today by a band of often piratical Scots happy to make their
fortunes in the wilds of the New World.
Actually, the Scottishness of Montreal is obvious. It's there, at the
centre of the city: McGill, one of Canada's most prestigious
English-speaking universities. It sits on the slopes of Mount Royal, its
view of a wide stretch of the St Lawrence River now interrupted by the
skyscrapers of Montreal's business district. At the centre of the
university a plinth commemorates its founder. The inscription reads:
''To the memory of the honourable James McGill, a native of Glasgow,
North Britain.''
An Edinburgh graduate, McGill would probably not have minded being
described as a North Briton. He bequeathed 46 acres of land to the
university, which opened its doors with $10,000 and 20 students in 1843,
so that the then colony might have ''an English college on a liberal
scale''. The students had to trek through cow fields in the area known
as Burnside, in their plain clothes and gowns, to reach their lectures.
A century and a half later Montreal is a thriving cosmopolitan city,
half French, half English, and proudly bilingual. A stready stream of
immigration from the French-speaking third world -- Haiti, Vietnam, west
Africa -- gives it an enviable vibrancy.
Its residents, when not moaning about the politicians filling their
ears with the complexities of Quebec's claim to independence, tell you
proudly that their city combines all the style of Paris with the comfort
of the Americas. ''We've got croissants and telephones that work,'' one
told me.
Scots were instrumental in bringing Montreal to that happy medium.
With Dinu Bumbaru, a French Canadian of Romanian descent and director of
Heritage Montreal, as my guide, I sweated my way around the streets of
the old city in the footsteps of those who made their fortunes from
furs, sugar and shipping. They first began to arrive as demobilised
soldiers after 1760, when British forces under Wolfe defeated the French
under Montcalm, and drove France out of Canada.
They began the hard way, living through tough northern winters to
trade furs with French Canadian trappers and enrich themselves on the
opportunities offered by a newly opened, phenomenally wealthy land. Here
the Auld Alliance with France prospered. The Scots became bilingual, and
even married French Canadians. They founded the North West Company to
compete for the fur trade with the English Hudson's Bay Company (which
eventually won out and absorbed the Nor Westers in 1821).
By the mid-nineteenth century, the names of McTavish, Fraser,
Frobisher, McGillivray, and Allan dominated Montreal's mercantile
aristocracy, the ''hyperborean nabobs'' described by Washington Irving.
Those that didn't make a fortune became gardeners, and for a while in
the 1880s the Montreal melon grown by Scots gardeners in Outremont was
famous as far as the United States.
Along the streets of central Montreal their legacy is obvious:
Ravenscrag, the baronial home of the shipping magnate Sir Hugh Allan,
with its roof tower from where he could watch for the arrival up the St
Lawrence of his steamers which ran the post between Canada and England;
or the Angus McIntyre house down the street, built from granite imported
from Dumfriesshire as ship's ballast.
Modern Montreal still treasures its Scottish roots. Many of the
families that built their wealth in the nineteenth century remain at the
top of the city's financial, commercial, and legal establishments.
Montreal's Scottish societies celebrate with Highland games and other
cultural activities. Down in Dominion Square Robert Burns has his own
pigeon dropping-splattered statue, a reproduction of the one in Ayr.
In summer Montreal makes it impossible to imagine that snow ever
comes. Temperatures soar, the humidity rises, and the residents take to
the air-conditioned museums, clubs, and hotels for relief, or lounge in
their gardens, where colour and lush greenery mock any suggestion that
this is the great white north. Along Rue Saint Denis, in the heart of
the French quarter, the restaurants crowd their chairs and tales on to
the pavements. In the side-streets the clapboard houses and rough pine
telephone poles, their wires looping along across the street to each
address, suggest the continuing chaos of frontier life.
Along the river, old Montreal -- where French colonists founded the
city in 1642 -- has been transformed gradually into an urban play area,
pedestrianised, its stone warehouses where once the merchants stocked
their wealth now home to restaurants, art galleries, and shops. The
waterfront is also the embarkation point for an exhilarating jet-boat
journey up to the Lachine Rapids which, until the completion of the
Lachine Canal in 1821, blocked access to the interior along the St
Lawrence. With its views of the city, it is one of the most pleasant --
and in a heatwave, coolest -- ways of seeing the city.
Montreal's population is split evenly between native French and
English speakers. For most residents the debate over language, culture,
and the future of Quebec has become an annoying background noise, an
unanswerable question that gets in the way of the simple task of living.
By Quebec law French is the province's official language. But in
Montreal bilingualism is the thing. Single-language Montrealers are
rare, and in shops, restaurants, hotels, or businesses one can open a
conversation in either language, confident of an answer you can
understand.

Michael Fry investigates the books which suggest everyone vcan be a
culinary master.
THE Masterchef style of cuisine is not something that greatly appeals
to me. It is impossible to make a vice of virtuosity, in the kitchen and
elsewhere, rather as Mendelssohn did in comparison to Schubert.
Lightning preparation and spectacular presentation are in themselves no
guarantee of good cooking. These tele-competitors never do tripe, for
example, which lends itself to neither, yet is delicious and nourishing.
We should recall the words of the great Escoffier, who warned us that
a dish should take just as long as it takes, and that excessive
finishing is only likely to bring complaints about the meal being cold
-- precisely the state, I suspect, in which the Masterchef judges always
eat what they are served.
Still, we should be grateful that the Masterchef prize has so often
been carried off by Scots, who do something to bring the razzmatazz down
to earth. The latest winner, Catherine McFarlane of Newtonhill,
Kincardineshire, takes pride of place in the volume now published of all
the recipes which featured this year.
It may be worth recalling how she did it. She started off a bit fiddly
for my taste. Does the scallop mousseline with inlaid crab she offered
in the first round really need a tartlet of Jerusalem artichoke to go
with it? Does the fillet of Highland hare with wild mushrooms and creamy
marsala sauce require four other garnishes? Even in the menus for the
second round, the quails baked in red peppers seem to me quite enough
without the corn muffins containing sun-dried tomatoes. But the crispy
skin salmon with the mushrooms, kale and lentils sounds fabulous, as
well as suitably ethnic.
And her winning finalists' dishes were a little more restrained than
the earlier ones: oysters and scallops in a sweet pepper sauce, followed
by lamb stuffed with black pudding in brambles and apples, accompanied
by vegetable purees. If this kind of thing makes your mouth water, and
you are as proficient as Mrs McFarlane, then Masterchef 1995 may be for
you.
Still, for home entertainment by mere mortals, I should think the
collection called The Creative Cook more useful, and better value, too.
It is not a beginner's book, but it aims to present interesting dishes
relatively undemanding to prepare, and does well to dig out 320 recipes
which answer to that description. It draws extensively on cuisines, such
as the Mediterranean and the oriental, supposed to be healthier than our
own, and gives a wide range of recipes for rice, grains, and pasta, as
well as vegetarian ones. But there are plenty of good meaty dishes and
sticky puddings besides.
Marie-Pierre Moine is a fine homely French cook, concerned that we
should fill our stomachs in the most delicious way possible. She
demonstrates very well that you cannot go far wrong if you plump for
traditional favourites, sublimated as they may be by the principles of
classical cuisine, or refreshed by individual touches.
In the series she is launching, she displays an admirable expertise in
different aspects of cookery. I do not quite see why this cannot all be
brought together in one volume, but the results are rewarding.
Uniform with her book is one by Anna del Conte on Italian cuisine.
She, too, has many excellent and some appealingly unusual recipes. But
she tries to persuade us that Italian cuisine consists mainly in
antipasto, pasta, and sweets. In other words, there is no secondo, no
carne, no main course. That may be so in her particular neck of the
woods, but it is not a proposition that any Italians of my acquaintance
would accept.
Claudia Roden re-publishes her classic on coffee. It tells us in
delightful fashion everything we could possibly want to know on the
subject, gives various methods of making coffee, and recipes for
desserts or cakes.
I find it hard to see why Pat Chapman should produce a volume of
tandoori recipes. This branch of cuisine is excellent, but it can only
be done properly in an authentic oven, with which few of our homes are
equipped or ever could be. You might do a feeble imitation on the grill,
but the time, effort, and risk of getting it wrong would make this an
extravagant exercise. Why bother? Again, just go to your local Indian
restaurant. Meg Jansz's book on barbecues offers many useful hints.

Joan McFadden travels back in time to find this traditional period
reveals far more complex designs than the popular view suggests.
Victorian Interior Style,
Authors:Joanna Banham, Julia Porter, Sally MacDonald.
Retail price #14.99
pp 1st July 1995 (Studio Editions)
VICTORIAN Style is traditionally associated with dense patterns and a
confusion of clutter. This is reinforced by standard film and stage sets
of the period, with the overall impression of an absolute minimum of
spare space, every surface area crammed with ornaments, walls completely
covered with pictures and the furniture itself being a mixture of
different types and style.
Despite this rather negative opinion, 19th century homes are
apparently enjoying a new popularity and many of the buyers are
developing an interesting in authentic decor. A close study of the
period reveals far more complex designs than the popular view suggests,
and this book aims to provide a chronological survey of Victorian
interior design from the early 19th century until the First World War.
This includes information on influential designers, discussion of the
main styles of furnishing and decorating, the circumstances in which
they were employed and their subsequent popularity or failure.
This could have resulted in nothing more than a catalogue, but
fortunately, the authors live up to their intentions and have produced a
fascinating account of evolving style in a historical setting which
details the social, political and economic framework which shaped its
development. All the detail included throws up some surprising facts,
such as Victorian designed being peculiar not only to Britain but
equally to America, and also to some extent, Europe.
An awareness of style permeated every class of Victorian home, but
hard economics dictated surviving source material. Working class homes
were rarely photographed or described, and their occupants were treated
similarly, with little or no interest in their situation. Furthermore,
in poorer homes most things were used until they were worn out, while
middle class families treasured possessions and handed them down
throughout the generations. The authors make it very clear early on in
the book that any view of 19th century style must therefore be highly
selective, with the emphasis on middle and upper class homes.
This does not detract in any way from their description of life in all
classes of Victorian society, which were constantly interlinked by the
very nature of the work involved in running a big house. Stately homes
had fleets of servants, and this was mirrored by the middle classes who
modeled their domestic situations on the gentry, and modified them
accordingly.
The use of cheaper materials, and developments in industry which
facilitated mass production brought dramatic changes to the middle class
market. The products and services were marketed and sold to the customer
in a much more sophisticated manner than previously. This was mainly as
a result of the growth of the mass media in the late 19th century, where
newly established women's magazines, trade journals and local newspapers
increased opportunities for advertising. Lavishly illustrated catalogues
were produced by wholesalers and retailers, not simply to illustrate
stock but to encompass an image of the ideal home and capture the
imagination of the consumer.
Conventions, propriety and status, were as important to the Victorians
as style, and as more work moved out of the homes into factories,
offices and shops, this shaped the new concept of a home being a haven
from work. This also brought a more marked division between male and
female spheres of activity, which was in return reflected in the home.
Certain rooms were associated with men, others with women, while
children also had increasingly separate areas, as did servants. Subtle
those these divisions were, they were vitally important to the
Victorians and are evident in many aspects of design.
It was within this complex framework that a myriad of styles
developed, which could be bewildering even to writers and analysts of
the time. This book manages to list and scribe the most popular, while
also covering the famous, such as Morris, Whistler and the Esthetic
Movement. It is a wealth of information, and although a specialised
subject, one that has been covered with the lay man in mind. My only
gripe is that the authors are clearly such experts that they assume
their readers will have similar backgrounds, resulting in occasional
comments which can leave you wanting further explanation, such as
mention of Whistler's ''Irregular'' domestic arrangements.
The illustrations are excellent, and in some cases breathtaking. This
is more than the title promises, although it does seem to manage to
cover every possible area of style within the period. It is also a
fascinating historical commentary which puts Victorian interior style
into context in the clearest manner.

THE SHEPHERD'S CALENDAR;
THE THREE PERILS OF WOMAN;
A QUEER BOOK
James Hogg
Edinburgh University Press,
#29.50; #32.50; #29.50
BEFORE he died of cancer in 1991, the Scottish film-maker Bill Douglas
spent months and precious energy trying to raise money within Scotland
to turn his screenplay of James Hogg's Confessions of a Justified Sinner
into a film. I have seen the script, and agree with others that it is a
masterpiece. But so is Hogg's novel, and he has never received the
attention he is due for it and for his other works in poetry as well as
prose. It is this neglect that Edinburgh University is trying to correct
by publishing Hogg's collected works in 31 volumes in the Stirling/South
Carolina Edition.
James Hogg was born into a farming family in Selkirkshire in 1770, and
while working as a shepherd began to write verse. In 1802 he met Walter
Scott; their friendship was to endure until Scott's death in 1832.
Though the Laird of Abbotsford helped the Ettrick Shepherd, it was as
his social superior. Scott never really rated Hogg as a literary rival.
He ridiculed him as ''the great Caledonian Boar'' and dismissed the
novel The Three Perils of Woman, published in 1823, as ''Hogg's
pearls''. The Three Perils of Man (1822) had been heavily indebted to
the Waverley Novels in its historical opening. ''The days of the Stuarts
. . . were the days of chivalry and romance.'' It is the story of the
siege of Roxburgh Castle, and features Michael Scott, the famous
warlock, a poet, a friar, a glutton, and a beautiful girl.
As Douglas Gifford pointed out in his important study of Hogg (Ramsay
Head Press, 1976) Scott told Hogg he had ruined ''one of the best tales
in the world'' with his extravagance in demonology, though Scott's own
stories and poems contained goblins, astrologers, and even the Devil.
In The Three Perils of Woman Hogg turned from history to contemporary
manners. ''Peril First'', which moves between the Borders, Edinburgh,
and Glasgow, concerns the emotional tensions in the lives of Gatty Bell,
her cousin Cherry Elliot, and her lover McIon of Boroland, a student of
medicine in Edinburgh. Cherry dies of a broken heart, and Gatty goes
into a catatonic state for three years.
''Peril Second'', set in the Highlands at the time of the Forty-five,
is a comedy of sexual rivalry involving a trio of lovers. ''Peril
Three'', which follows directly on, deals with the punitive measures
after Culloden.
In his introduction to this new edition of The Three Perils of Woman
Antony Hasler claims that this novel ''stands with the Confessions at
the very peak of Hogg's achievement, and in some respects actually
surpasses it . . . Perils of Woman is by turns pathetic and horrific,
farcical and grotesque, and finally harrowing to a degree unmatched by
any fiction of the period''.
Hogg must have felt that he had cast his two books of Perils before
swine, and when the Justified Sinner appeared in 1824 he was accused of
''disgustingly abusing his imagination''. One reason for his lack of
success as a novelist was that he did not conform to the intellectual
standards set in the post-Enlightenment glow of Edinburgh salons. Burns
had been feted as the ''ploughman poet'', and Hogg was expected to
retain the role of the Ettrick Shepherd. Even Scott had been scared off:
he chose the anonymity of the Author of Waverley because Edinburgh
society frowned on a rising lawyer writing fiction.
The Shepherd's Calendar, published in 1829 from ''Tales and Anecdotes
of the Pastoral Life'' that had appeared in Blackwood's, would have
pleased the Edinburgh literati better. Here was a man writing anecdotes
about the hard life of the shepherd, and short moral tales about rural
characters like the cruel Mr Adamson, struck by lightning because of his
treatment of a poor neighbour.
This new edition restores cuts and revisions made by Hogg's nephew
Robert Hogg.
James Hogg was undervalued because he was far ahead of his time. He
recognised that the oral tradition provides the best stories because
they are adapted and refined by many imaginations over time.
He was putting magic realism into his stories a century and a half
before the internationally lauded Latin American exponents of the genre
such as Allende and Marquez.
A much more experimental and more daring writer than Scott, Hogg was a
better prose writer than poet. Why call a volume of poems A Queer Book?
Because Hogg desperately needed an audience. The real Queer Book is the
Justified Sinner, and it is to be hoped that money will be found to make
Bill Douglas's film, and that money will be spent buying this important
new edition.

MY EDUCATION: A BOOK OF DREAMS
William S Burroughs
Picador, #14.99
SOMEHOW the books make it easy to picture Burroughs, 81 now and
beached (slap bang in the middle) in Lawrence, Kansas, a fossil lizard
on the floor of a dead sea, toying with his guns, dreaming his wintry
dreams, and every now and then turning the noises in his head into marks
on paper, like automatic writing from the far side of coherent, like
autism.
This doesn't mean his fictions are autobiographical, not as such,
though most are rank, beneath their layers of allegory, with the whiff
of that vice. Instead it is as though Burroughs has modelled himself on
a character in his own writings who somewhat resembles a ''William S
Burroughs''. The fictionalised Burroughs has become, in whatever mental
space he occupies, the real Burroughs, all austere misery, gnomic
humour, and hard-earned pretension.
It began very early. The very first fictions came laden with
disclaimers but the sense of a life rehearsed, and of a script that gave
both life and art a shape, was always strong. Nor did it help (or
hinder) that Kerouac among others could not resist turning the elder
statesman of the brand-new writing into a fictionalised character --
Will Hubbard in Vanity of Dulouz, Bull Hubbard in Desolation Angels.
Artifice in the matter of Burroughs is all, a negotiable currency that
today, unblinking, the old man exchanges for celebrity, whether
advertising sports shoes on TV or ''collaborating'' with rap bands.
Is he any good? It hardly matters now, if it ever really did.
William Seward Burroughs is embedded in the myth of which he was chief
architect and has been since ''William Lee'' produced Junkie (or
''Junky'') in 1953. All the trivia is stitched in place, like tarnished
buttons on an old uniform, the fables of Ginsberg, drugs, Kerouac,
Tangiers, the wife he shot (artistic inadvertence), the cut-ups, the
fold-ins, the thoughts of Brion Gysin (weird but never wonderful), The
Naked Lunch, Interzone, more drugs, and the arcana of an alleged
pre-life as private detective, bug exterminator, film actor, bartender,
and friend -- it impressed the younger crowd -- to genuine hoodlums.
Burroughs was never part of the ''Beat Generation'', of course. On
that he has insisted and you grant him some credit for seeking to avoid
guilt by association. But the glamour of the label, the persistent
belief, not least in the US, that a disparate group of very mixed
abilities mounted a social and cultural revolution, has been
irresistible.
After Kerouac he is the most notable of the bunch. Having survived,
despite everything, he must also be accounted the most successful, if
bad Hollywood versions of your novels still count as success.
The present volume has thus been touted by its publishers as the
closest thing we are liable to get to a memoir. Given the extent to
which Burroughs has fictionalised himself, this is doubtless true; given
the nature of the book -- the spurious ''significance'' of dreams, the
profound inconsequence of reverie, the convenient absence of structure
-- it doesn't seem such a privilege.
Burroughs and his publishers would also have you believe that in this
detritus of the psyche are the means to make something new. Art -- you
may have heard this one -- springs from dreams.
Here, we learn, the author is ''committing the unspeakable crime of
questioning the reality structure'' and taking us on a ''haunting
journey into perception''. Given what follows, however, it is probably
just as well that he quickly identifies the alleged difference between
''boring'' conventional dreams and a ''special class'', the latter being
the opposite of those which are ''so often dull when related . . . '',
lest there be any confusion.
The only context here is William S Burroughs, that persona long
familiar from fiction.
Somewhere amid it all, a young companion kills himself. This matters.
Elsewhere the planet is dying. That matters too. Dreams and memories
come and go. All of these matter, and matter equally, indiscriminately,
for all the world as if a depressed old man whose sexuality has long
since ''withered'' has been persuaded to have transcribed ''many hastily
jotted notes on scraps of paper''. And he has.
It is, in other words, the same old spiel, another contribution to a
self-serving mythology. The man is the art and if you happen to like the
one about Ronald Reagan and the opium suppository you might get a couple
of laughs.
Otherwise this is a book for people with imaginations so poor they
can't afford their own solipsism.

IT WOULD take more pages than this to credit all those who replied to
Cheynes Makeover Competition. I can only say that there was not a dry
eye in the office. Not only did readers, and you know who you are,
submit heartrending pleas for the chance to be cosmetically born-again,
but some wrote poetry too. There is an ocean of talent out there, and I
am pleased to have sampled it. But readers have any amount of
inspiration.
We heard of the problems faced by working mothers with five weans and
beetroot for lip stain. Of the effect the previous water shortage had on
beauty regimes, of coming to terms with not just daily HRT, but
bankruptcy and major operations, and how the tactless comments of
relatives on one woman's physical appearance finally took root and
eroded the basic platform of her self-esteem. What can I say. I wish
that the hundreds who took the time to write could be freed of chattels
like their husbands, and hang-ups like their mother-in-laws.
But really, some of you need to be taken in hand, such as Pamela Brown
of Lanark who described herself as a ''fairish, fattish, fortyish Mum''
and Sally Hislop of East Kilbride, Glasgow who wrote: ''I am 10 weeks'
pregnant, I look and feel ghastly and would love to be glamorous''.
Please, girls. I sympathise, we all do, but such severe self-criticism
leads to low self-worth, and that's the only thing which has been
holding women back for so long.
Thanks also, to those who wrote back on cards -- we received some very
tasteful examples of cats and kittens and poppies and pictures of
Habitat furniture. Even some envelopes too, were in-laid with some kind
of flower power wallpaper. Collecting my mail from the ducat soon became
a very pleasing and fragrant experience.
Nevertheless, five winners have been selected, and each will receive a
hair and makeover at Cheynes, Edinburgh's leading Hair Salon. Kate Black
of Argyll was compelled to write, after being subjected to objective
advice. She recounts: ''I said to my neighbour, I think I'll have my car
valet-serviced, and she said, ''Och, why don't you spend it on your
face''.
Joanna Burke of Alloa has been having a hard time too. She explains
she was ''a fashion model in the fifties, a model in the sixties, a
beauty salon owner in the seventies, bankrupt in the eighties, and a
recluse in the nineties''. She needs a makeover to ''revitalise''
herself, which we think we should grant, because after all that, she's
willing to have another go.
''Twenty-five years of marriage complete, three children flown the
nest! The stranger who stares from the mirror implores, 'Please make me
look my best' '' comes from our third winner, Mrs Eleanor Calder of
Galashiels; and the fourth is Pat Matheson from Lenzie, who will be
enduring a makeover in the name of all women who are ''chauffeur, nurse,
gardener, dog-walker, answering service, cook, housemaid, wife and
mother''.
And finally, our last winner is Anna McLaughlin of Bishopton who says,
calmly, ''I need a head start and a perfect finish''. Quite. We'll be in
touch.

* NATURAL oils are not a new discovery. They were, in fact, the first
cleansers and moisturisers known for use on the body.
Perfume and oils were not considered a luxury but a necessity in
ancient Egypt, and while a wealthy woman might employ numerable
attendants to help her in her toilette, everyone had access to the oils,
creating a demand great enough to inspire the first skin-care industry.
In a testimony to the benefits of the oils and the importance of
taking care of yourself, in the eleventh century BC, Egyptian labourers
working on a necropolis at Deir el-Medina went on strike, one of the
reasons being that they had no access to the oils and unguents needed to
moisturise their skin and protect it from the sun's drying effects.
The Body Shop have a range of natural oils, which last for months.
I've had a wee bottle of wheatgerm oil, which I use around my eyes to
stave off crows feet, for almost two years (yes, I'm that dedicated) and
it's still not finished.
Their collection includes Sweet Almond Oil from the almond tree in
Asia and North Africa, for moisture; Evening Primrose Oil from a plant
which is used by North American Indians for its healing qualities;
Carrot Oil which protects against ageing and infection, and Jojoba Oil.
Apache Indians use Jojoba seeds as a hair tonic and to treat skin
disorders, and don't have any reservations about recommending it to the
West. (Indians? Reservations? Get it?)

Dante Gabriel Rossetti
Russell Ash
Pavilion Books #25
PAVILION Books are a small, independent publishing house who are
rapidly establishing a reputation for excellent books about artists.
Scottish bibliophiles are perhaps most aware of their superb Jack
Vettriano compilation which came out last year. Russell Ash's
sumptuously illustrated study of Dante Gabriel Rossetti can only enhance
Pavilion's burgeoning good name in the fine art field.
Rosetti was the leader, and most influential member, of the
pre-Raphaelite Movement which managed both to scandalise mid-Victorian
society and to sharpen its aesthestic responses. Rossetti was a poet as
well as a painter, but he is now most celebrated for his extravagant yet
fastidious oil studies of beautiful and voluptuous Victorian women.
Ash's words are intelligent and informative, but the real glory of this
book is to be found in its 40 magnificent, large-format reproductions. A
genuine bargain at #25.

Fashion, as everyone knows, was invented in the lush cornucopia of
Eden. Whatever was Eve thinking about? Instead of munching on forbidden
fruits, she could easily have skinned that much-maligned serpent and run
up a great pair of jeans.
Cleopatra knew better. But while she was checking the real and very
much alive snakeskin swatches for her sexy new bikini, the asp - which
she had discerningly grasped - bared its fang. Reality, as they say,
bites. And the rest is history.
Snakes have not enjoyed a particularly good press ever since. But all
that is about to change. For every well-tended fashion wardrobe should
now have a section devoted to such small scale wonders.
So what is suddenly so great about snake? It might seem a little
vulgar, yet that is just exactly why it has become fashion's hot
favourite for the season ahead. For it brings a welcome dash of fashion
fizz to the minimalist silhouette and neutral-to-monochrome colour
palette. . . a little whimsy in a fashion world of serious suits.
And snake is sexy too. Remember Wild at Heart? Nicholas Cage's
memorable snakeskin jacket comes redefined by Karen Millen as a
skinny-fit blazer to team with low-rise hipsters. Very Vegas. But if
your bag is something altogether more refined, there's still a place for
a little well-bred python in your life. Think small, and perfectly
formed - with two handles and a clip-top frame.
Yet snake charmers need not panic. Their carefully trained reptiles
are under no serious threat from the new generation of accessory
manufacturers cobbling together the boots, bags and belts which will be
the must-haves of the season. Those funky knee-high boots, the ladylike
bags and the ever-so-skinny belts are all invariably faux. It's all mere
lookalike lizard and parodies of python. For snake, dear reader, read
fake.

RICHARD INGRAMS: Lord of the Gnomes, Harry Thompson, Mandarin, #6.99
* EXCESSIVE praise is deadlier than any condemnation -- a truth that
all biographers should keep close to their hearts, but one ignored by
Harry Thompson in this astoundingly sycophantic hagiography of the
former editor of Private Eye, beside which Boswell's Life of Johnson
reads like a life of Trotsky written by Stalin. Though fascinating for
its detailed and bitchy history of Private Eye and the 1960s-1970s
satire scene, Lord of the Gnomes prefers to make even the most
ridiculous excuses for Ingrams's less lovable quirks -- including
homophobia, anti-Semitism, and public-school snobbery -- rather than
paint a portrait of a flawed but essentially decent English patrician
eccentric. The laddie doth protest too much.
THE INFORMERS, Bret Easton Ellis, Picador, #5.99.
* AFTER American Psycho, with its loving descriptions of mutilation
and sexual abuse, any less rebarbative work from America's leading
specialist in despair and brutality must be counted an advance; but The
Informers, a return to the blank nihilism of rich young Los Angelenos
with too much money and not enough problems, will do nothing for anyone
previously unenthused by Ellis's debut Less Than Zero. Interchangeable
bodies take drugs, work out, have passionless sex, and talk non-stop
about each other's sex, drugs, and fitness problems until you want to
kick them. The prose is, as usual, impeccably flat and affectless, like
Ellis's people.
THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WHAT?, Bob Jackson, Guinness, #7.99.
* ANOTHER book of essays in popular and practical science, less
breathless and gee-whizzy than the Guinness imprint might lead you to
expect, and thankfully free of trivia-quiz facts about the biggest,
smallest, fastest, etc. Instead, Bob Jackson explains some of the
scientific terms casually thrown about in news stories (global warming,
the ozone layer, and so on) and delves into less immediate but none the
less fascinating questions like left-handedness and the nature of
memory. He isn't as orthodox and conservative as a popular scientist
should be -- he's credulous about ESP and the paranormal, for example --
but his style is clear and chatty and he explains complicated questions
well.
THE FABER BOOK OF MURDER, Simon Rae (ed), Faber, #9.99.
* ALTHOUGH one feels a little uneasy about being seen reading it in
public -- murder both real and fictional is an interest most of us feel
but prefer to keep discreet -- Simon Rae's anthology is an addictive box
of poisoned sweeties that will have most people dipping in again and
again for just one more wicked taste. Poetry and high literature,
including De Quincey's essay Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts
and George Orwell's The Decline of the English Murder, rub shoulders
with detective stories and newspaper reports of murder most foul, making
many intriguing juxtapositions that draw one's attention along from one
item to the next. Death has never been so interesting.
SOMETHING IN LINOLEUM: A Thirties Education, Paul Vaughan, Sinclair
Stevenson, #9.99.
* IF you like John Betjeman's poetic celebrations of English suburban
life between the wars, but sometimes feel that they are too much marred
by a certain mean-mindedness and snobbery, Paul Vaughan's kindly and
amusing memoir of middle-class life in Brixton and New Malden in the
1930s will be a great pleasure. Gently sending up his genteel origins
while maintaining an obvious and sincere affection for that vanished
world of Rexine sofas and valve radios, Vaughan paints an almost
tangible picture of a time and place and gives the reader a convincing
insight into the mores and attitudes of what was then a larger and more
influential sector of society than it is today.

William Hunter remembers Green's PLayhouse, an ocean liner of a
theatre, where dreams came true nightly and twice a week on matinees.
UNLIKE old pictures which only fade away, old picture houses die. At
the end, Green's Playhouse, Glasgow, went in its own way. Like the old
elephant it was, it perished slowly. There was no sad fuss or popular
rites. Former fans failed to turn out to pay their respects. And the
Playhouse itself missed its own funeral. By the time the cinema fell
permanently into darkness it was called something else and no longer
showed films.
Ten years after, what remains of one of the most wonderful palaces of
entertainment in Europe is only the deepest, weediest hole at the centre
of the city.
For one former patron, however, the show has gone on. To Charles
Harkins, an out-of-town regular from Ayrshire, the Playhouse show has
been a continuous programme. He has never shaken off his Green's habit.
Memories kept reeling through his mind to the extent that he has
produced a scrapbook of the cinema's story.
We Want ''U'' In recalls an early house advert that had two wee
kilties lifting the U letter into the Playhouse's sign.
Charles Harkins's fascination goes back to 1958. He was 11 when his
father first took him to the big pictures. For a treat they had a meal
first in the cinema's cafe before the show. Only from his later
researches can he tell that they must have seen the Victor Mature war
movie, No Time to Die. But he has no recollection of it. Some other film
might as well have been on the screen.
''I saw very little of it,'' he said in what sounds a strange
confession for so loyal a historian. For an explanation he added: ''I
was quite overawed by my surroundings.''
His childhood filmgoing until then had been to the Regals at Saltcoats
and Dalry and Stevenston's Grange. Green's at the top of Renfield
Street, being the world's biggest cinema outside America, was another
world.
''After that first time I was never in Glasgow without going to the
Playhouse for my breakfast, lunch, or my tea,'' he said. ''And to see a
picture, of course,'' he added as an afterthought.
His pleasure in the Playhouse had little to do with what was on. He
felt most at home during the intervals. He revelled in the architecture.
His heart was fullest when the screen was blank. In his book he can be
at his most lyrical about the house's curtains -- ''a magnificent
combination of brushed velours, velvets, silk and satin''.
Charles Harkins's enthusiasm sustains an old Glasgow theatre tradition
that goes back to when pantomime audiences used to applaud the scenery.
When the Greens, a former showground family, planned the Playhouse,
their vision was for more than a plain dark box to show shadows in. They
constructed palatially. Their creation, in 1927, amounted to what is now
called an entertainments complex. Attached were two grand restaurants.
Waitresses were dressed as Dresden shepherdesses. On stage they had a
gorgeous dancing troupe, the Playhouse Girls. A miniature golf course
did not last long. But there were Sunday symphony concerts. For a
crowning attraction a rooftop ballroom was added. Doormen wore
Ruritanian uniforms. Altogether, there was room for 7500 customers
inside.
The dream house's style was sumptuous throughout. Really what the
Greens had built was a land-based ocean liner. When the cinema's opening
was delayed for a week, one reason was that the builders had run out of
white marble from Sicily.
After such early glory came sadder, seedier days.
Charles Harkins recalled: ''Finally, the Playhouse sat at the top of
Renfield Street like an ageing dowager, faded, and with no place to go.
The once splendidly draped grand proscenium was a shadow of its former
self.
''The final indignity on my last visits was to discover that strip
lighting had been installed above the once de luxe fauteuils -- the
golden divans -- thus removing the last vestiges of theatrical
ambience.''
It was the divans, red or gold, which made the Playhouse the acme of
posh picture-going. Yet although the Green's empire controlled 24
cinemas, its big house never became a film mecca. Its only sensational
season was with The Jolson Story. Like other independent owners, the
family organisation was starved by the giant exhibitors.
Fred and Bert Green made commercial mistakes of their own. Charles
Harkins berates how they had second thoughts about putting in a cinema
organ. He writes: ''The fact that no pipe organ was installed was a sad
loss because with the fine placing of the organ chambers and the
marvellous acoustics of the Playhouse, it would have been splendid to
hear.''
A greater loss of their showmen's nerve was to build their flagship
house behind an old tenement block on Renfield Street. Unlike their
Dundee place, destroyed the other week by fire, their Glasgow showpiece
lacked a theatrically exciting front. Essentially, the dream palace
created by cinema architect John Fairweather was a backlands
picturehouse on a grand scale.
''If it had been built with a proper facade, the building would be
there yet,'' Charles Harkins insisted.
His loyalty persisted through the dim days. It became his custom
always to take the same golden seat on the front row of divans next to
the aisle. Often enough there would be only two other patrons in the
1227-seat balcony. He always suspected they had got in on free passes.
Admission prices and the cost of scrambled-egg breakfasts in the
Geneva restaurant have been the least of Charles Harkins's expense. He
has been more out of pocket to the Playhouse since it closed than when
he had a movie thrown in for his entertainment.
Few cinema mementoes anywhere have been kept. There has been little
cherishing of bughut souvenirs. Few of even the ritzier houses have made
a sentimental journey into cinema history, and the Playhouse was no
exception. Without Charles Harkins, it might have vanished without
trace.
Writing a book had not been his intention. ''Nothing was further from
my mind,'' he said, his early obsession having been to make an archive
of the architect's designs and any other pieces of Playhouse bric-a-brac
he could unearth. ''Do you remember how wee boys always wanted to be
train drivers? Well, I wanted to be a cinema architect. It was never
on,'' he said. He became a bakery worker instead.
His We Want ''U'' In -- lovingly written but messily typeset here and
there --is an incidental short feature to his main programme that has
taken seven years of research.
They involved him in copying old newspaper adverts for pieces of
malarky like The Flying Fool, starring William Boyd, and Harold Lloyd's
The Kid Brother which the Green brothers promoted with a farmyard
setting of (live) hens and rabbits in the foyer.
For his outline history of the rooftop palais Charles Harkins lacked
the personal knowledge and good attendance that he gave to the cinema.
He only once visited the dance-hall, and it was not the happiest
experience. By then it had become a haunted wreck of a ballroom.
Upstairs dancing was the idea of Fred Green. During a visit to New
York in 1919 he became convinced he could improve on the rooftop hall at
the Ziegfeld Theatre. His original notion seems to have been that cinema
customers would complete their day out by going dancing. It was a double
treat that Glasgow never took to.
Then in 1940 -- 12 years after the hall opened -- Fred Green had one
of the brightest coups in Glasgow showbiz.
A three-week booking that included the Ne'erday holiday was made with
Joe Loss whose orchestra had been playing at the old Empire Theatre
round the corner from the Playhouse.
The band's date at Green's was to become a repeat engagement for 11
years. For many Glasgow revellers dancing to Joe Loss became as much a
part of their New Year as the midnight bells. The Playhouse made itself
the first ballroom outside London where the big bands played.
Fred Green's impresario touch had been to swing the deal by offering
Joe Loss half the takings. Nearly every namely orchestra in the country
followed. In an appendix to his book Charles Harkins has made a
toe-tapping list of them --Oscar Rabin, Harry Roy, Nat Gonella, the
Squadronaires, Dr Crock, Johnny Dankworth, Harry Gold, the Clyde Valley
Stompers . . . All-girl bands included Ivy Benson and Lena Kidd.
Fred Green was entitled to boast: ''I can take the pick of the bands
and expect them to study the job. What this hall requires is a stage
show played at ballroom tempo.''
What the hall did not need was an unexplained fire in the winter of
l988. It ensured the demolition of the whole complex that had already
been abandoned by the Apollo concert-hall which the cinema had become.
On his last visit Charles Harkins found grass growing in the former
restaurant. Starlings nested. He rescued a piece of the house carpet
with its once proud motto of IT'S GOOD. IT'S GREEN'S. just soggily
visible.  When for the first and last time he made it to the ballroom,
he was not dressed for dancing. He was wearing a borrowed demolition
man's helmet and carrying an usherette's torch.
''On the few days I'm now in Glasgow and passing near the top of
Renfield Street, it takes me all my time to look at where it all used to
be,'' he said.

LEWIS MUMFORD AND PATRICK GEDDES: THE CORRESPONDENCE
Frank G Novak, Jr
Routledge, #49.50
HANDS up all those who know exactly what Sir Patrick Geddes
(1854-1932) achieved. I thought as much.
Geddes was recognised as a great teacher (zoology lecturer at
Edinburgh University, professor of botany at University College in
Dundee, guru at large) but, like many great teachers, tends to be seen
through his pupils who are inclined to be blinkered.
It is difficult to know where we are coming from when we consider the
greatness of Geddes from the point of view of his great disciple Lewis
Mumford (1895-1990) who despaired of ''the effacing humility and
ruthless arrogance of this great man''. At least we know where Geddes
came from and how it affected him.
Born in Ballater, Geddes moved with his parents to Perth in 1857. On
Kinnoul Hill they settled in a house which Geddes's father called Mount
Tabor Cottage after the sacred mountain of Northern Palestine. Geddes
had the luck to live at Mount Tabor Cottage for the next 17 years and
acknowledged that the house and garden informed his affirmative attitude
toward the environment.
In an essay in the Contemporary Review of June, 1897, he referred to
his memories ''of trotting after Father my little barrow and tools, or
helping Mother with her flowers; and of watching things grow, of
climbing the trees, of feeding the robins and pigeons out of my hand,
and of many roamings . . . '' Educated at Perth Academy, he valued
natural beauty above ''book-cram''. So he said.
He studied biology under Thomas Huxley in London and during a
scientific expedition in Mexico in 1879 suffered a temporary blindness
which led him to develop a graphic method of using folded squares of
paper to express his ideas. And his main idea was to impose his
idiosyncratic personality on all who paid attention to him. Men like
Mumford who claimed: ''Geddes, by confining so much of his thought to
his limited graph-bound vocabulary, was incapable except in spontaneous
speech of drawing on the fullness of his own life experience.''
Mumford desired a dialogue with the great Scot but found the
spontaneous speech of Geddes a monologue -- ''incessant soliloquy'' --
defining anyone who would listen as a disciple.
In his lifetime Geddes collected disciples the way some obsessives
collect stamps. At the Outlook Tower in Edinburgh and at the Department
of Civics and Sociology in the University of Bombay and at the Scots
College in Montpellier, this innovative sociologist and biologist
encouraged others to come under his influence. A visionary who combined
artistic insight with scientific erudition, Geddes was adored as an
intellectual icon by the international audience he captivated.
Some disciples became more famous than the one they called the father
of modern town planning. Hugh MacDiarmid was hugely influenced by
Geddes's concept of ''The Scots Renascence'' (the title of an article
Geddes contributed to his own periodical The Evergreen in 1895) and
called Geddes ''one of the greatest Scotsmen . . . in our entire
history'' when reflecting on his own life as ditto.
Mumford, celebrated American cultural critic, described himself as ''a
disciple of Patrick Geddes, and . . . an abject admirer of everything he
has said and done''. That was in 1920, three years before Mumford met
the one he called the Master.
Mumford came across the work of Geddes in 1914 when, as a student at
the City College of New York, he read The Evolution of Sex (1899) and
Evolution (1911) by the Master and his disciple, J Arthur Thomson.
Mumford went on to read Geddes's City Development (1903) and Cities in
Evolution (1915) and to write to the Outlook Tower, in 1915, for more
information about Geddes's current outlook.
On January 8, 1917, Mumford wrote his first letter to Geddes himself
and signed himself ''Your respectful and affectionate pupil''.
Devastated by the death of his son Alasdair -- who was killed in action
on the Western Front in April 1917 -- Geddes replied on August 8, 1917.
It was soon evident that Geddes was looking for a surrogate son and felt
he had found one in Mumford.
The two men only got together twice -- New York in 1923, Edinburgh in
1925 -- and Mumford realised he was expected to act as Geddes's
passively doting disciple. Wrote Mumford in Sketches from Life (1982):
''What Geddes urgently demanded of me was an impossible lifetime of
devotion as Collaborator (read docile filing clerk!), as Editor (read
literary secretary!), or as Secretary (read handy drudge!). In short,
the perfect disciple: his alter ego!'' Meeting Geddes made Mumford feel
like a scolded schoolboy yet he kept in touch with the Master.
In one of the last letters Geddes wrote, he addressed his critical
pupil as ''Dear Mumford -- (no -- Lewis my Son!)''. In positively his
last letter to Mumford, on April 2, 1932, Geddes lectured his reluctant
surrogate son on his ignorance of the origins of the International Style
in modern architecture: ''If you could come or go by Glasgow -- and see
Charles (Rennie) Mackintosh's Glasgow School of Art, you'd have this
'New' movement thereafter in better perspective than as of all from Le
Corbusier, etc''. Dying in Montpellier, Geddes was still thinking of his
life in Scotland and hoping Mumford would follow in his Scottish
footsteps. Geddes emotionally blackmailed Mumford by honouring him as
his heir and advising him to complete the work he, Geddes, had started
in Scotland.
It was always thus. Geddes, in 1922, told Mumford: ''You Americans . .
. miss or lose touch with Scotland (and) continental ideas come there
first, and for many centuries back''. In 1930 Geddes explained: ''You
can't fully know how true (Scotland) is -- without both knowing our
University and City atmospheres at their best and the very large
proportion of Scots influences -- in literature, and learning, in arts,
in politics, in religion and in science, which so much lead in
England.''
Mumford first-named his son Geddes and flattered his insistent
father-figure throughout a fascinating correspondence that shows how one
outrageously opinionated Scot attempted to educate an enormously
influential American.

Domestic accidents kill almost twice as many people as our roads.
George Hume wonders why so little is spent on prevention
THE odds against your dying in bed are getting longer although there
is a very fair chance that you will pass away at home -- by accident.
Last year 700 Scots breathed their last in the sitting room, the
kitchen, wrestling with a DIY project or out in the garden . . . neck
broken, run through, electrocuted, or chopped up by a power tool.
More of us are killed at home than on the roads, with Sunday the
deadliest day. ''It can't happen to me,'' is the motto of the unwary who
end their days in an ambulance dash to hospital, the echo of their
famous last words -- ''I didn't think it would matter'' -- the epitaph
on a mortuary slab.
But despite Scotland's disproportionately high number of home accident
deaths, the Scottish Office puts less than one-tenth of the money into
home-safety campaigns than it devotes to educating the public about the
hazards of traffic.
Vicki Welch, home-safety manager in Scotland for the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Accidents, believes only a major change in public
attitude towards safety in the home will have an effect and reduce the
accident toll. ''Overall deaths are coming down but the number of
injured is increasing. The drop in deaths could be due to medical
practice getting better. My own gut feeling is that accidents are
getting worse and what we need is a nationwide change in attitude.''
Better road safety and a reduction in drink-driving offences have been
achieved through campaigns, she points out, and now speeding motorists
are being targeted. But if there is to be any improvement in home safety
a two-pronged effort is needed -- a high-profile campaign backed up by
the provision of expert advice. And that, she says, is not in prospect
with meagre government funding.
''The Scottish Road Safety Campaign gets around #1m a year from the
Scottish Office, whereas home safety gets just #75,000 -- an odd
distribution of funds when there are 400 road deaths a year but more
than 700 in the home,'' she says.
''The Road Safety Campaign can point to great success, but until such
time as safety in the home gets proper recognition and adequate funding
we will not be able to achieve a similar success.''
RoSPA refers to deaths and injuries in the home as the Hidden
Epidemic, with carelessness the main cause. Most at risk are the
under-fives and the over-65s, but even active adults do away with
themselves -- dozens every week -- simply because they have untidy
working habits and do not bother to think ahead.
According to the Association of British Insurers, whose members are
called upon to pick up the bill for others' lack of thought, there are
5000 deaths annually in the UK, with two-and-a-half million people
requiring hospital treatment, as a result of home accidents.
The living-room is the site of one-fifth of all deaths and accidents,
largely, says Welch, as the result of clutter. The garden -- especially
the lawn -- claims 17% of the accident total: electrocution by
lawnmower, strimmed toes, and severed digits in the hedge are common.
Kitchens, where the most serious accidents occur, account for 16% of the
total -- scalds, burns, and stabbings feature frequently -- while trips
and tumbles on inside stairs run at 12%.
DIY scores 8% -- 200,000 victims a year fall to the cult of power
tools, ladders, and scaffolding, shot through by nail guns, and cut up
by power saws; while man's best friend gets in on the act with around
76,000 animal bites added annually to the score of suffering.
Welch says: ''Clutter is a killer. For example, a handbag is put on
the floor and someone catches their foot in the strap -- remember we do
not always look at our feet when we walk across a room.''
And much the same applies to DIY enthusiasts. They should clear the
area in which they are going to work, plan ahead, and use the right
equipment. People get badly hurt -- some are killed -- because either
they are not qualified to do a job, use the wrong tools and equipment,
or do not use the equipment properly.
''Circuit breakers should be used and goggles too when necessary --
hundreds of serious injuries are caused every year because people use
drills without eye protection. Whatever the activity they all say 'it
won't happen to me' and then, after they are injured, 'I didn't think it
would matter'. But it does.''
The vulnerable under-fives have to be protected, she says. ''Those
looking after them should be vigilant not only about what they can do
but what they may do next. They have to anticipate what new skill the
child might employ. Remember to keep tablets out of reach and realise
that a carelessly placed cup of tea or coffee can scald.
''When it comes to older folk, although none of us wants to feel we
are getting on in years, we must recognise that there are limits. They
need to think ahead, be aware of their safety and not overreach
themselves.''
Lack of funds has meant very little research into the detail of
accidents but it is known that slips, trips, and falls account for the
majority, that most happen between 6am and 7pm, in the summer, during
school holidays, and on Sundays.
When it comes to the cause of accidents man's ingenuity knows no
bounds -- shattered glass and sharp tools, poisoning and drowning,
electrocution and fire, scalds and animal bites . . . home sweet home.
The bitter part is that most accidents in the home are preventable.
Human error is almost always the cause. Tony Baker, deputy
director-general of the Association of British Insurers, says: ''People
are particularly vulnerable at times of stress, when their routine is
changed or as a result of unsafe practices. A little extra care and
thought can save a great deal of misery and pain.''
So, come Sunday, with the summer sun shining and the evening under
way, remember that although home is where the heart is, if you clear the
clutter, work safely and think ahead, the heart has a better chance of
beating on in the home.

COME TO GRIEF
Dick Francis
Michael Joseph, #15.99
I MUST first, as we say in politics, declare an interest. I bought the
first novel that Dick Francis wrote three weeks after it came out. All
his others, I have bought in hardback on the day of publication and
there is no other author, since Ian Fleming, of whom I can say that.
What I write hereafter, therefore, must be taken in that context.
Come To Grief is the best book he has written since . . . Wild Horses,
his most recent . . . High Stakes, his fourteenth out of 33 . . . Dead
Cert, his first -- take your pick, they would all of them be true.
Sid Halley, injured jockey turned investigator and one of Dick's only
two heroes to figure in more than one book, returns here for a third. As
the book opens, he has had, in the course of his professional duty, to
put one of his best friends in the dock for a particularly nauseating
crime.
Furthermore, the friend is so universally loved that nobody is
prepared to believe such an accusation against him and all the odium
descends on Halley himself. ''It would pass, I knew,'' he says on page
one. ''One simply had to endure it and wait.''
And, endure it and wait he did. To give away more at this stage would
be doing no service to the reader -- except perhaps to say this. A Dick
Francis villain is usually so thoroughly unpleasant, and his heroines so
eminently desirable, that a large part of enjoyment of the books is
waiting to see each get their respective desserts at the end. But this
time both are more complex characters and so deftly drawn that one
catches oneself liking the one and distrusting the other against one's
will.
There is another innovation in this book. One of the items auctioned
by the BBC for their Children In Need Appeal last November was ''To have
one's name mentioned in Dick Francis's next book'', and the successful
bidder was Mrs Patricia Huxford.
This was indeed honoured in Come to Grief. Although I was watching out
for this name to appear, it was slipped so skilfully into the
investigative part of the story that, when it did make its appearance
quite late on, I had to look back to the credits at the beginning to
check that this was indeed her. I am confident that it will give Mrs
Huxford the pleasure she deserves.
I won't say that I couldn't put the book down. Apart from being a
cliche, it wouldn't be true. I had to force myself to put it down,
several times, purely because I didn't want to finish it too quickly.
If you are an occasional buyer and reader of Dick Francis, make this
one of the occasions. But if, like me, you are an inveterate one, buy it
and read it now -- and the sooner you will be able to read it again.

They are pleasure grounds, havens of tranquility in the bustling heart
of Glasgow's West End. Julie Bertagna takes a leisurely tour of the
urban oases
THE world gathers in Paris, they say, to sit at a pavement cafe and
watch itself go by. Yet here on my very doorstep, in a little park in
the West End of Glasgow, it seems that the world has come to meet me.
For whenever the sun shines, the nations unite in the wide green oasis
just outside my window.
Scots, Irish, English, American, Italian, Jamaican, French, Armenian,
and more: on long hot days the population of this cosmopolitan corner of
the West End spills into the little park, our gardens. The very first
residents of these Victorian terraces called the communal gardens their
pleasure grounds. And for us, a century later, they are too.
Out we come laden with kids and toys, books and barbecues. Our
children band together, a young United Nations, to play and squabble and
picnic and nap in the cool shade of the trees. The midgies finally send
us all straggling home at dusk -- grubby, happy, sleepy with sunshine.
Westenders love their gardens, parks, and pleasure grounds. Like
Saturday morning croissants and cappuccinos, no Westendy (trendy or
otherwise) would be without them -- our precious pockets of green peace
on the city's doorstep. They are far grander than a private garden, less
public than a park.
For suburbanites, the lack of your own backyard (and often it is just
that) overshadows everything else -- the bustle, the privacy, the warm
communality, the independence, and sheer fun -- of living in a city
village. Staunchly ignoring the chant of popular wisdom (get thee to a
house in suburbia, with a garden, before the age of 30; or at least
before the kids come) the true Westendy keeps putting off the dreaded
day -- sometimes forever . . .
The best time, the time to really savour the gardens, is early morning
as the city wakens. A great oval of sky yawns above the rooftops and
branches as I unlock the gate. And, feeling like Mary Lennox at the door
of her secret garden, I think how still it is, how still. The outside
world is a small noise like a radio left humming in the corner of a room
though Byres Road, the hub of the West End, is only a short street away.
Now, as the day starts up, curtains begin to twitch open all around.
The residents come to their windows, mugs and newspapers in hand to
greet the new morning as they always do with a glance over the gardens
then up at the sky, reassured by the great wash of green lawn before
they measure up the day's weather.
Three tiers of windows surround the gardens on all sides. The windows
eye each other over a rim of hedge and between ranks of tall trees. The
curve and dip of the ground makes a great green amphitheatre that echoes
with a soundtrack of birdsong as the tiers of windows fill up with a
breakfast-time audience.
Rising above the trees is the university spire. The huddle of ungainly
modern stumps that wreck the skyline is the university library. Its
chimneys pump little puffs of smoke as the gentle industry of study
begins above the staggered slate roofs of the West End.
Each of these little parks has its own peculiar character. The
elongated triangle of Westbourne Gardens has a sedate Edwardian air not
unlike London's Bloomsbury Square, while Kensington and Huntly Gardens
are leafy green islands amid the traffic which shortcuts down to Byres
Road. (Though at rush hour it might feel a bit like sitting on a traffic
island.) Kingsborough Gardens are a pretty border alongside the pink
sandstone terraces that are busy with ivy, stained glass, and
wrought-iron. Crown Gardens are deep, mysterious, and gloomy even on the
sunniest of days, amid heavy banks of rhododendrons.
Geometric shapes set the other gardens apart from Athole Gardens, my
gardens, whose grand oval of sloping lawns and stately trees have a
welcoming, communal feel. As you walk up and round the crescent it's
easy, in the calm of a summer afternoon, to imagine the clop of a horse
and carriage on the bend and Victorian ladies taking tea in the
drawing-rooms that look out over the pleasure grounds.
Many of the names -- Westbourne, Crown, Kingsborough, Kensington --
seem to aspire to a more southern grandeur. But Athole is Gaelic for a
second Ireland and to my mind that's just the name for this tranquil
emerald isle in the West End.
At night the gardens are a still black pond. The old gas-style,
electric-lit streetlamps give out a poor light yet somehow the wide
space of dark encourages a spirit of openness around the gardens:
curtains stay drawn apart late on all but the most chilly nights. Come
storms and Bonfire Night we all crowd our windows to watch the light
show on our screen of sky.
A walk in the gardens at night, surrounded on all sides by the bright
tiers of uncurtained windows, is like watching a multitude of stage
plays all at once: different acts in the lives of the people who make up
this microcosm of the West End. Shamelessly, I look around to see what's
showing tonight. Up on a first floor I recognise the stilted poses of
The Extremely Awkward Dinner Party. A few doors down, in a shadow play,
Passion Flowers Behind The Window Boxes. The Tragic Tuba Player is a
nightly event.
In gem-lit basement caves down behind bars, a gipsy glamour in their
squalor, are the student glory-holes. So sub-divided are these rooms,
with ugly planks of hardboard slicing the windows in two down the middle
of a bay window, I can't help worrying that the inhabitants will grow
lean and lanky in an effort to accommodate themselves into such poky
spaces.
More fortunate are their elevated colleagues up in the gods, those
romantic attic bedsits I always craved as a student, with matchless
views across the city and a guttering that sprouts dandelions, daisies,
and daffodils in spring. Here anything goes, even ceilings quilted with
a wildly-coloured collage of fabrics -- brilliant billows of cottons,
silks, and satins.
Just next door to the student warrens are the unpeopled flats, where
there is never a hint of clutter. The decor is calm, the window panes
gleam. The vase of fresh tulips and a crisp new hardback on the window
table are changed, by invisible hands, every couple of days.
All around the gardens there are living-rooms where, if it wasn't so
rude, you'd ring the bell and ask for a browse: those wallpapered with
books; mini-art galleries; and one enchanted dwelling, its jade walls
sprinkled with gilt stars, cherubs, and curios.
The university bell sounds the hour. Midnight. A faint scent of garlic
from nearby Di Maggio's and the ghostly song of a distant band of
revellers carry on this windless, still-warm air. I suddenly remember a
cold evening just before Christmas: Natalie, not yet a year old,
gurgling at all the Christmas trees, at window upon window of twinkling
lights surrounding us. The gate chinks shut behind me now and I leave
the gardens' soothing well of dark to walk the few yards to my door.
Come summertime, the gardens are an oasis of cool green, flecked with
people. Unspoken segregation operates: singles and couples claim privacy
among the trees on the upper lawn while gangs of babies and toddlers
romp in nappyless ecstasy on the large flat lower lawns.
In summer, gaudy For Sale signs flower with the window-boxes and fall
away with the leaves in autumn. Up on the rooftops the students clamber
out from their attics, crowding the slates like great crows, down to
just a single layer of student-uniform black. There is the odd flash of
exotic turquoise or flame-orange hair plumage as the excluded ones
paddle their toes in the blue pond above our heads.
The residents' rules bar the unmortgaged among us. The bedsitters have
to make do with doorsteps and rooftops when the sun shines. I'm forever
amazed they don't splatter water bombs on us in our smug seclusion. But
there are ways around rules, methods of vaulting over high hedges when
the sun goes down.
One June night the dreamlike forms of naked revellers chased each
other in and out the dark shadows of the gardens in a burst of midsummer
madness (it wasn't that warm).
Another midsummer, local dance students gave a spine-tingling
performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream among the trees and bushes in
the sunset-shadowed gardens.
All this togetherness brings its problems too, though. The gardens are
owned by all of the residents and mean different things to different
people. For some they are an oasis of calm in the city, a precious piece
of greenery and birdsong, a haven to be vigorously protected; for others
they are a safe playground, a communal space for city families to enjoy
the benefits of a small park on their doorstep. Inevitably, the needs
and desires of each group clash. How do you find a middle ground between
a bunch of teenagers in football boots who want to empty into a safe
green space on long summer nights and the couple who want to stroll hand
in hand in a quiet dusk?
Quiet, to quick bosoms, is a hell, wrote Byron; and hell, to quiet
bosoms, I would counter, is a park on a summer evening where every
corner resounds with the roar of footballing teenagers.
But a rampaging toddler is, likewise, something of a challenge to
tranquil sunset strolls, especially one who sets about several thousand
daffodil bulbs with the passion of a dog in a park full of buried bones.
Suddenly, in the gardens debate, I find I have a foot in both camps.
The back garden in suburbia, though? Private and compromise-free,
certainly -- yet after this great sweep of green it would seem
claustrophobic, boring. There would be all that weeding to bother you
too.
The pleasure grounds are my place to people-watch and wander, to chat
and play, to be as involved or separate as it suits. A place where you
lie under trees and think, meet friends and picnic, stretch out and
contemplate the sky in this grand and majestic garden.
And yet -- there's always the buzz of the city behind it all; the hum
of life all around; the sound of the world that exists just outside this
haven.

STRANGE and ''spooky'' coincidences are much more common than we might
imagine, claim scientists in the UK and the US. It's a fascinating
phenomenon, and even slightly disturbing to some people who find
coincidences creepy. The researchers were examining the kind of
circumstance when you meet a complete stranger at a party, and discover
that you both went to the same school, or have the same birthday, or
have recovered from the same rare illness. Was it just coincidence -- or
was there some mysterious paranormal force at work, bringing you
together?
Susan Blackmore, a psychologist from the University of the West of
England in Bristol, and Robert Matthews, visiting research fellow at
Aston University, Birmingham, have discovered that coincidences are far
more likely than we think, and they have used strict scientific
principles to work out the expected rate of creepy events.
They have also found evidence that our expectation about the
likelihood of such coincidences becomes less reliable the more
''outlandish'' they appear to be -- a finding that may cast light on why
so many people feel the need to invoke paranormal explanations for
''spooky'' coincidences.
Matthews and Blackmore base their conclusions on a study of responses
to a simple question about coincidences: how many randomly-chosen people
do you have to bring together to stand at least a 50:50 chance of two or
more sharing some trait? This could be, say, an astrological sign, one
in 12, a birthday, with odds of 365 to one. Or sharing a secondary
school, in which the odds lengthen to more than five thousand.
The true answers can be calculated using probability theory, and they
are surprising. For example, five people are needed to give 50:50 odds
of two or more sharing the same astrological sign, which seems
reasonable. But just 23 people are sufficient to give 50:50 odds of two
sharing the same birthday -- and a mere 85 are needed to give the same
odds for two coming from the same secondary school.
Put simply, the reason is that these coincidences do not demand a
match with a specific star-sign, birthday, or school. All that's being
asked is that, among the many possible pairings that can be made from
the people in the crowd, two will share some star-sign, birthday, or
school.
As a result, the number of people needed for such coincidences is
often surprisingly low. Certainly, anyone trying to guess the number of
people using a simple pro-rata rule would soon go hopelessly wrong. For
example, if they guessed that around six (ie, two in 12) people were
needed in the case of matching astrological signs, they might reasonably
expect that 2500 people would be needed for the secondary school case --
but this is a huge over-estimate, 30 times larger than the true number.
In earlier research, Matthews had suggested that this surprisingly
large disparity between intuition and reality might prompt people to
reach for paranormal explanations. But do people really use so simple a
mental rule to gauge the likelihood of coincidences?
To find out, Matthews and Blackmore gave a questionnaire with
coincidence-related questions to 120 subjects.
The results provide evidence that people do indeed use a simple -- and
very unreliable -- pro-rata mental rule when trying to gauge the
likelihood of coincidences.
''Many scientists tend to dismiss accounts of ''spooky'' coincidences
out of hand, and certainly such coincidences often do have simple
explanations'', says Matthews.

OUR China correspondent has been back in touch after a long period of
silence. The Scottish engineer who is working on a major contract near
Beijing keeps us up to date with vignettes about life in his adopted
country.
His latest intelligence concerns China's unwanted ammunition. He
writes: ''Almost every country in the world has an army. Armies have
guns and ammunition. Ammunition has a 'shelf life' after which it has to
be disposed of. Charts of the sea around Britain show areas marked
'Danger explosives dumping ground', this obviously being how we dispose
of the problem.
''Not in China, they have a much better idea. Instead of it costing
money to dispose of obsolete ammunition they charge people for the
privilege of firing it off. Prices vary according to what you want to
fire, anything is possible and the army makes a profit. I am going to do
this thing.''
China, I know, is moving towards a market economy, but is this not
carrying things a bit too far?
One that got
away, honestly
WE have all heard a few fishy tales in our time but Charles McSherry,
managing director of Prosys, the Glasgow-based business systems and
communications firm, came up with the real thing when he broke off from
a fishing holiday on the River Spey to attend a business breakfast to
accept the Investors in People award from Tom Farmer, chairman of IIP in
Scotland.
Each of the 45 guests at the Stirling Management Centre was presented
with a gift of smoked salmon, but McSherry had the decency to admit the
fish was not the result of his efforts on the Spey. He had, he
conceeded, purchased it from SL Neill, the salmon smoker, who is also a
customer of his.
He then went on to confess that, as far as he was concerned, all the
salmon on the river had got away. At least he was honest.
On the ball but
still too late
WHO said you should never let sport get in the way of business?
Certainly not Jack McGinn, the former chairman of Celtic Football Club
and vice-president of the Scottish Football Association.
He was due to unveil Skillball, a device designed to help youngsters
develop their footballing talents, at the opening of Strathclyde
Business Development's latest New Enterprise Workshops in Alexandria.
Unfortunately, he was delayed along with the Celtic team on the journey
back from Georgia after their European Cup Winners Cup victory.
The event had to go on without SBD's star turn, but we are assured
there is a bright future ahead for Skillball. Perhaps, McGinn should
have taken the prototype along to Parkhead earlier this week where it
might have come in useful.
The Paris match
must go on
STAFF at legal firm MacRoberts are waiting to hear if Jim Arnot, one
of their senior partners, managed to organise a game of cricket.
He has been at the International Bar Association annual get together
in Paris where there is normally a cricket match between England and the
Rest of the World.
It seems, however, the organisers decided there were other more
interesting pastimes and organised an afternoon of sport which included
a golf tournament and a sailing regatta instead.
Nevertheless, Arnot, who is known as someone who normally gets his
way, headed for the city's Palais Des Congres determined the cricket
match would go on. Watch this space!
Goats of the
world unite
YOU may have been under the mistaken belief that Beijing was hosting
its major conference this year when the women of the world gathered
there, but the Chinese capital's big event is actually taking place in
1996, when the V1 International Conference on goats is being held from
May 6 to ll.
Jia Youling, chairman of the Chinese organizing committee, has invited
the Glasgow Chamber of Conference, and has informed it that: ''The COC
has put a strong program into place for the enjoyment of international
guests, and accompanying persons.''
Visitors will have an opportunity to see China's goat industry and,
says the invitation, ''to exchange information about the China of goats
and the related industry.''
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce denies that it has suggested to the
Chinese authorities other Scottish chambers that it thinks would be more
suitable recipients of this invitation.
Fruit take to
city's streets
GLASGOW'S ''pears'' raised a few eyebrows yesterday as they were seen
wandering around the city centre clutching a briefcase in one hand and
pears in the other.
The businessmen were in fact returning from the annual election
meetings of the 14 Trade Incorporations of Glasgow which were held in
the Trades Hall on Glassford Street. At the meeting the 200-year-old
tradition of handing out pears to ''craftsmen'' is continued.
The story goes that when, at the end of the 18th century, the Trades
Hall moved to its present location on land purchased from Mr Glassford
part of the ground attached contained an orchard and craftsmen would
help themselves to pears as they left their September meeting. The
orchards may have disappeared but the tradition continues.
Among those elected yesterday was former Glasgow Lord Provost Robert
Gray, who became Deacon of the Incorporation of Wrights, a trade with
which he has been connected for 50 years.
Robertson puts
his finger on it
SHADOW Secretary of State George Robertson was taken aback when Dr
Allan Groden, managing director of Sanmex in Rutherglen, appeared
carrying a cumbersome container which he announced was an aerosol can.
Robertson, who thought he was at the factory to open a state of the
art production line for leading brands of aerosol, must have wondered if
he had arrived at the wrong address.
But the MD quickly put his mind at rest, explaining that what he was
holding was a 1930s aerosol can. A relaxed Robertson then declared the
new line open, and welcomed the fact that a further 100 new jobs would
be created at the factory over the next 12 months.

SCOTLAND produces more than 70% of the UK's opto-electronic graduates,
a staggering proportion when you consider the size of our population. It
is no surprise then to learn that over the last 10 years or so a number
of innovative Scottish companies have been blazing opto-electronic
trails, each specialising in a particular area of this ground-breaking
technology.
One such trailblazer is Optosci, a small, hi-tech company engaged in
research, development and manufacture of opto-electronic systems,
components and instrumentation. Based at Strathclyde University's
Business Incubator, it was established in 1994. It is owned in part by
three of its directors and its general manager, Dr Douglas Walsh -- all
high flying opto-electronic academics -- and also by Strathclyde
University and Lithgow's.
Optosci has already won a SMART Award for its innovative fibre optic
technology; it has won a regional enterprise grant for its tuneable
laser research, and it is now aiming for a second stage award from the
Scottish Office for the next phase of its research and development.
The company was launched to bridge the gap between the ground-breaking
fibre-optic research taking place at Strathclyde and Edinburgh's
Heriot-Watt universities and its commercial exploitation. Scottish
opto-electronic and laser expertise are a decade ahead of anything
available elsewhere in the world. But far too often in the past, says
Walsh, ideas developed and refined here have been turned to profitable
use in Japan or the US.
The market for products based on fibre-optic and laser technology is
vast. It includes all aspects of the media, IT, environmental monitoring
systems, cable networks, CDs and so on. Optosci is developing a range of
in-line wavelength selective fibre lasers. At the same time it is
conducting further research into the development of in-line wavelength
tuneable fibre laser systems. Both have potential applications in
fibre-optic instrumentation, optical spectroscopy, medical diagnostics,
environmental monitoring and fibre-optic sensing. The first generation
of fibre laser products are due to go into production in 1996.
Small companies such as Optosci, says Walsh, are particularly well
placed to exploit the specialised niche market which requires this ever
more sophisticated technology. Optosci's unique fibre laser is able to
alter the configuration -- the operational wavelength -- of the optic
fibre from within. This gives optical systems greater power to transmit.
To generate still more funds for its research and development, Optosci
is engaged in commercial activities in related fields. It designs,
manufactures and supplies Educator Kits, full educational packages of
laboratory exercises for opto-electronic students. These were developed
by Heriot-Watt University, and there is a worldwide demand. The company
also designs and sub-contracts the manufacture of a range of
opto-electronic laboratory instrumentation for research and development
labs in the universities and industry.
Finally, it is maintaining a continued interest across the wider
spectrum of fibre-optic research. The directors, each of whom is
involved either with Heriot-Watt or Strathclyde University, are always
looking at new developments and assessing the potential opportunities
within the marketplace. Last month they boosted their international
profile by participating in the Munich laser show.

THE fact that, from the end of this month, hospitals will no longer be
able to incinerate clinical waste on site is creating a clutch of new
business opportunities across Scotland. A number of commercial groups,
offering a range of alternative technologies, are busily bidding for
disposal contracts.
The bidding process, as The Herald reported at the start of this
month, is proving deeply contentious, with the largest health board,
Greater Glasgow, now on its fourth attempt to place a contract. Its
latest reported option centres on sending clinical waste from its
hospitals across the country to Dundee, where it would be incinerated at
the local district council's Baldovie plant.
If finance can be secured for a new electricity-from-waste facility
there, the incinerated waste could end up feeding the grid with power
subsidised under the Government's scheme for promoting green forms of
electricity.
The new Baldovie project, known as DERL, originally had the backing of
ScottishPower. But when it failed to qualify for subsidy in the last
tranche of awards under the Government scheme, the privatised utility
withdrew.
The idea of dressings, sutures, even diseased tissue and organs from
the sick of Glasgow being turned into megawatts through incineration in
Dundee is all the more surprising since waste from Tayside hospitals
will, from October, be treated in a quite different way, by a
Glasgow-based company currently commissioning a #1m plant in Arbroath.
ScotSafe is the brainchild of Ian Reynolds, a waste consultant, and
George Weir, who used to run the incubator unit at Strathclyde
University. Weir used, in effect, to be Reynolds landlord because his
company, 3E Consultants, was an incubator resident.
The technology it promotes is called continuous feed augur (CFA) and
involves cooking the waste -- anatomical parts and radioactive material
are excluded -- in an Archimedes screw heated by oil to more than 100
degrees centigrade.
''It's cooked without any chemical change,'' Reynolds explains.
''Moisture is flashed off as steam and recirculated. The air which is
vented off goes through two filters and emerges cleaner than the intake
to a hospital operating theatre. The waste is reduced in volume by
between 60% and 70%. Its mass is reduced by around 30%. When it emerges
it looks like the lining of a Jiffy bag. Microbiologically, it's cleaner
than a washed salad.''
It goes, after treatment, to land fill. And the reason ScotSafe is
building its plant in an ordinary factory unit on the edge of Arbroath
is the 10-year so-called Northern Consortium contract it won to process
waste from hospitals in Highland, Grampian, Tayside and part of Forth
Valley. With a projected turnover of around #1m a year at that plant
alone, ScotSafe reckons the capital investment is well justified.
''The capital expenditure on a modern incinerator to meet the new
emission standards would probably be four times ours,'' adds Reynolds.
''Economically, there is no argument about which is the most
cost-effective system.''
Rival technologies would, of course, dispute that. But in the crunch
business of winning disposal contracts and putting kit on the ground,
ScotSafe is head of some of its competitors. Apart from Arbroath, which
will process 5000 tonnes of waste a year, it is building a second
similar CFA in Sunderland to service a contract with hospitals in
North-east England.
ScotSafe UK has also opened a Dublin office to bid for contracts
there, where the authorities have set their face against any
incineration of clinical waste. In all, says Reynolds, there is probably
scope for 10 plants like Arbroath across the British Isles.
But how did he and Weir get involved in the technology in the first
place? It all stems from a chance conversation in Boston in the spring
of 1993. Under the auspices of Strathclyde Business Development,
Reynolds was attending the annual New England Environmental Conference.
At a conference dinner he fell into conversation with a Boston lawyer.
The lawyer asked what Reynolds' line of business involved. He offered to
introduce the Scot to one of his clients the next morning.
The client turned out to be the president of BioMed International, a
company promoting the CFA waste technology, which had, in another
intriguing twist to the story, been adapted from methods Heinz had once
used to cook its baked beans.
The licensor of that modified waste technology was a firm called
BioSafe, so when Reynolds and Weir decided to seek backing for a new
venture to sell the technology's virtues in the UK, the name ScotSafe
effectively suggested itself.
Apart from the technology transfer, BioMed has a 21% stake in
ScotSafe. The other investors are venture group 3i, Reynold's old
company 3E Consultants, and the two executive directors, Reynolds and
Weir. ''We are well captialised at #5m,'' says Reynolds.
Like other groups involved in CFA and microwave technology, ScotSafe
tendered for the Glasgow contract and is, just as they are, bemused at
the rumoured outcome. There appears to be a growing resistance in other
parts of the world to incineration as a method of clinical waste
disposal. Why the Greater Glasgow authorities, like their counterparts
in Lothian, are still interested in going down that route is a mystery.
But even if these particular contracts remain out of reach, ScotSafe,
with its Arbroath and Sunderland plants, looks set fair to capitalise on
tougher standards in how hospitals dispose of their waste.

IT is a truism that people are living longer. But the big problem
facing a growing retired population is how to provide for their old age
without suffering hardship or, indeed, having to settle for genteel
poverty.
For many workers the revolution that has taken place in the pensions
market in recent years has come too late. The option of early retirement
is simply not there, either because they have not put in sufficient time
in a company pension scheme, where the penalties for leaving early can
still be substantial, or they simply were not able to take out a
suitable personal pension plan.
Personal pensions have, after all, only been around in their present
form since July 1988 and prior to this the rules were extremely
restrictive. They have since become far more flexible but it is the
younger generation that should benefit.
Now, if planned for early enough, it is possible -- in theory at any
rate -- to aim for retirement as early as 50, though this would require
a considerable outlay and a good performance by the underlying
investments.
Most people would still not be able to afford this. And warning noises
are again being made about the country's future ability to pay even the
basic state pension which, in itself, is not going to keep anyone in the
style to which they have grown accustomed.
The original benefits envisaged from the state earnings related
scheme, which effectively tops up the basic state pension and to a
limited extent links benefits to salary, have already been reduced.
Moreover, employees have been encouraged to opt out and invest in
personal pension plans.
The basic state pension is #58.85 a week or #3060.20 a year. For a
married couple this is increased to #94.10 a week or #4893 a year. Its
value when expressed as a percentage of national average earnings is
roughly 15%, but it has been estimated this could fall to something like
7% in around 30 years.
By the turn of the century men are expected to live to 75 compared
with 45 in 1900 and women are expected to live to 80 compared with just
49 a century previously. We are also much less likely to stick to just
one or two jobs in a lifetime, so personal pensions could become more
the norm. There is also the factor that today some companies only employ
people on short-term contracts, so limiting their responsibility towards
them.
All of this points to a growing self-help environment particularly
when it comes to retirement provision. The miss-selling of insurance
products, not least pensions, which caused such a scandal and is costing
millions to put right, does not alter the fact that people will
increasingly have to make their own provision. There will, of course,
have to be a state safety net for the worst off.
Pensions have become increasingly complicated, and while the changes
being wrought by the combined influences of UK and European legislation
have good intentions, their impact on employers' costs can be major.
The really big companies will probably continue to offer occupational
schemes. But in many instances the provisions of the Pensions Act 1995
may discourage smaller and medium-sized companies from taking or
continuing this relatively expensive route.
Scottish Mutual is one life office that has decided the answer lies in
a money purchase group personal pension plan. This is aimed primarily at
employers who will remain the driving force, but it is basically a
personal pension which can be taken by the employee if he moves jobs,
though it would be up to him to persuade the new employer to contribute.
Basically, though, it is a conventional money purchase scheme with the
usual benefits such as life assurance, widow's provisions and so on. The
advantage to the employer is that it cuts out the adminstrative,
regulatory and financial demands associated with the traditional
occupational scheme.
Whatever the format of an individual's pension planning, there is a
growing belief that it should be compulsory for most people to
contribute to some sort of provision and so lessen the burden on the
state. As it is, a smaller working population in the next century will
have to support a substantialy higher number of retired people. So much,
though, depends on how much a person can afford to pay in, the
performance of the underlying investments and the level of annuity rates
on retirement. So it can still be something of a lottery.

* I started a PEP with Save &amp; Prosper in February 1992 and invested
#3000 in the Fleming Income and Capital Investment Trust. As I was
mainly interested in capital growth dividends were re-invested. In
December 1993 I invested a further #2000.
I calculate that between August 1992 and this March the total value of
dividends re-invested amounts to #820, bringing the total cost of the
investment to about #5867. In June this year I asked for dividends to be
paid as income. I understand that a merger between Fleming's FICIT and
Equity Consort Investment Trust was also due to take place in that
month. Earlier this month the value of my shares totalled #5869.
Am I right in thinking this investment has been a total waste of time?
Since I now want to receive income, can you recommend a transfer to a
better Fleming trust, or to another non-Fleming PEP?
* Unfortunately if you wanted capital growth you bought the wrong
shares. FICIT is a split-level investment trust with a capital structure
consisting of equal numbers of zero dividend Preference shares and
Ordinary income shares.
The Preference shares are virtually guaranteed to grow at 11% compound
until liquidation in 2002. Capital growth of the trust is subordinated
to this, while all the income goes to the Ordinary shares.
On liquidation the surplus assets after the Preference shares have
been repaid at their uprated value belong to the Ordinary shares. Thus
if markets roar away the Ordinary shareholders stand to do well, in
addition to receiving a high income. If markets perform poorly then the
Ordinary shares may end up being worth less than you paid for them.
Sadly, your second tranche was bought at the peak of the market and
the Ordinary shares fell sharply afterwards. With hindsight you should
have bought an equal number of the two classes of share.
The trust has not been a strong performer from the capital angle,
showing an overall growth of 35% in asset value since early 1992, partly
because it has been managed with income in view. What growth there has
been has gone to the Preference shares.
You will have to accept a lower income if you want to have a
reasonable chance of maintaining the value of your investment in real
terms. Your options are to switch half the fund into the FICIT
Preference shares or look elsewhere, accepting the small additional
charges which would result. Alternatives could be Dunedin Income Growth,
yielding 4.6%, and Murray Income, offering 4.2%. Both have low charges.
* I was interested in your recent article about the cost of care for
the elderly and the risk of their house being sold to pay for care. Am I
right in thinking that some time ago you produced an article about
transferring a house to heirs while keeping the right to live in it
until death of both spouses?
If it is still feasible, what is the procedure and is it foolproof
against the local authority selling the house to pay for care? What is
the position if later one wanted to sell the house in question, for
example to buy somewhere smaller?
* The usual pattern is for the local authority to claim on the estate
of the homeowner requiring nursing home care when he or she dies or on
the estate of the widow or widower if living at the same address. To be
absolutely safe from the local authority taking account of the house
when assessing assets, you need to follow the rules governing
inheritance tax and transfer the property to your heirs at least seven
years before care is required.
If subsequent to this transfer the house was sold (assuming your heirs
agreed), they would be liable to capital gains tax on any gain if it was
not their principal residence, which presumably it wouldn't be. As for
the exact procedure you would have to consult a solicitor.
* This is probably an unusual request, since most people who write to
you seem to have surplus money. But could you advise me? Since my
partner left a few months ago I have fallen on hard times. I am an
employed professional with a net wage of around #1100 a month.
My outgoings, all on direct debit, are: mortgage (#43,000, property
still worth this), council tax #68, insurance #30.63, pension (I have a
pension mortgage) #45.54, savings plan #40, loan repayment (Marks &amp;
Spencer) #115.88, ScottishPower #51, savings plan (Australian Mutual)
#10.64, parking space rental #48. My bills are BT #100 per quarter,
factor #100.
I have two overdrafts by the end of each month of #200 and #400
approximately on two Bank of Scotland current accounts. I have cut up my
credit cards but still owe about #1800 on Visa and Mastercard.
I work 48 hours a week, often far from home and there really is no
time for extra work. My car (value about #2500) needs replacing.
Suggestions welcomed!
* The first thing is to try and reduce the credit card debt as this is
expensive credit. Your options are clearly limited but you might be able
to temporarily suspend payments into the savings plans and even into the
pension fund, though this would need the agreement of your mortgage
lender as well as the life company concerned.
It would be worth doing this because what you might be gaining through
interest and investment increases is more than offset by interest on the
credit card debt. A suspension of, say, a year would reduce the debt
while not making that much difference to the return from your savings.
One item which stands out in your list of expenses is the parking
space rental. Is no on-road parking available? Another point -- if your
car is worth #2500, does it really need replaced yet?
* We have considered opening building society accounts or buying
savings certificates for our children. We understand we can't save for
them and so only gifts from aunts, uncles and so on could go into the
building society, whereas the certificates would be tax free if bought
by us.
Is it possible to save part or all of our child benefit or would this
be considered as capital coming from us? If not, would a building
society whose account paid tax be satisfactory?
* Income arising to children under 18 is assessable on the parent
where the source of capital was provided by them. Capital includes the
gift of any cash including child benefit, and income arising on this in
a building society account would be assessable on you. If tax was
deducted in the account there would be no further liability unless you
were liable at the higher rate.
Of course, no tax would be payable on National Savings Certificates as
the interest is exempt. Income on capital gifted by other relatives
would be treated as income of the child.
These are the general provisions, but there is an exception where the
amount of income on capital gifted by parents is less than #100 for each
child in any tax year. You should be able to save your child benefit
without exceeding this and so have the building society interest paid
gross.

PROMISED LANDS
Jane Rogers
Faber, #14.99
IN Jane Rogers's last novel, Mr Wroe's Virgins, the hero takes his
followers to Australia where he is convinced they will be freed from
religious persecution. This new novel opens with marine lieutenant
William Dawes arriving in New South Wales filled with ambition. He has
come to build an observatory, to reform the convicts and convert the
Aboriginies. He, too, is driven by a fundamentalist zeal and is aware of
the difficulties.
''God tested his chosen ones -- as Christ was tested by suffering --
to prove their strength and love. It was important to remember that the
tormentors were weaker, that they had given in to the Devil's
temptations to be vicious. They were weaker, their victims stronger. It
was important to remember.''
William's story is being written by Steven Beech. He writes while his
wife Olla mocks him and reveres their baby. Her first child and younger
brother were killed by a genetic weakness and this pathetic child,
Daniel, becomes the focus of her existence to the point of obsessive
madness. She believes her son is the Messiah and sees herself entrusted
with his secret and surival.
''They are looking for ways to gain control over Daniel,'' she tells
us. ''And their best card is to dismiss me. Say I am depressed, unable
to act for the best, not good to look after my baby. I must be cunning.
I must never give them grounds for taking him away. Where necessary I
must obey them, at least while they are watching.''
For Steven, William is a means of therapy and escape. He hates his
present reality. The child is an incubus, his wife is remote. ''Dry-eyed
Olla. Unyielding, ungiving, unforgiving Olla. Olla who does not pretend
that she does not despise me. Who rightly chooses not to confer so much
as a flicker of her attention on whatever it is keeps me shut in my
study for hours on end.''
He is smarting from the failure of his ideals. He was a schoolteacher
who tried to convert Campfield Comprehensive into a radical
establishment where discrimination on the basis of intellectual ability
was abolished, where children could learn freely about sex, politics,
religion, and death, where justice was learned in practice through
debate, where freedom of thought and belief was sacrosanct.
By writing about Australia and William's good intentions, Steven tries
to make sense of his own life, unaware of his wife's obsessive love for
their child. The main weakness is that there is little to separate the
narratives or distinguish the voices, though it is difficult to imagine
how it could be otherwise, since their narratives are so closely linked
and two are in fact by the same person. These links are never obvious
and one of the many admirable things about this book is the way Jane
Rogers gives each a separate pace and function, clearly delineating
Steven's resentment and Olla's mad contempt,
William, Olla, and Steven dream of new worlds and are prepared to
sacrifice everything for their fulfilment. Everyone is convinced they
are right and know what is best for others.
William Dawes is based on a historical character who became
Australia's first astronomer. He is the most fully formed, perhaps
because the story is told in the first person, giving the reader a sense
of detachment, allowing us to observe the character and his actions. The
others have a tendency to justify themselves, which becomes obvious only
because they're addressing us directly.
Dawes means well and that is his tragedy. He is weak and his actions
have consequences which ripple far beyond his intentions. His complexity
lies in his humanity and his belief in others.
This is a fine, closely structured and beautifully written book, whose
impact is carried well beyond these pages. Jane Rogers touches history
and by using the past to inform the present, sustains an exceptional
dignity and truth.

FACING up to credit card bills at this time of the year can be hair
raising, especially if you've enjoyed a summer holiday abroad. Could
that long, boozy lunch in that little French restaurant really have cost
so much? And whatever possessed you to pay such a price for that garish
pottery in Spain?
Spending with a credit card never feels as painful as handing over the
cash or writing out a cheque, especially when you're in a relaxed
holiday mood and haven't done your currency exchange sums correctly.
It's when your profligacy is there for all to see, totalled up on the
monthly bill, that reality finally sinks in.
Finding the money to pay for your summer fun is bad enough so you'll
want to avoid adding insult to injury by making sure you pay the bill on
time and don't incur hefty interest. It may seem pretty innocuous at
around 1.7% if you miss the payment deadline. But it looks much more
nasty when translated into an interest charge of, say, #17 on your next
bill if you and your family clocked up #1000 worth of spending during
your summer break.
It's easy to incur interest by miscalculating how long it will take
for a cheque to reach your credit card account, whether your payment is
blown off course by the vagaries of the post or the cheque clearing
system.
Banks aren't bothered if you miss the deadline and interest starts
piling up, of course -- that is how they make their money. But more and
more are giving customers a better chance of avoiding charges, although
not all do much to publicise the different services available.
Since the middle of August TSB customers who pay their Trustcard bill
at a TSB branch, using a TSB cheque and before 4pm, haven't had to wait
the normal four days for payment to reach their acount. TSB claims it is
the first major High Street bank to introduce such a scheme.
''Not being able to settle credit card bills on the same day as
customers present cheques is one of the most common complaints of all
credit card holders,'' says David Gagie, TSB's credit card marketing
manager.
Until other banks follow the TSB's lead the only other way of making
sure you don't miss the payment deadline -- without getting organised
days in advance -- is to pay by direct debit. Some card issuers will
provide a direct debit service for customers only if asked, while others
take a more active approach.
National Westminster has been promoting its direct debit scheme for
the last month or so. ''Around half our customers pay off in full each
month and when we've carried out customer surveys the idea of paying by
direct debit each time often crops up,'' says NatWest. ''You can opt
either to pay the minimum required each month or to pay the bill off in
full, but you can change your mind about how much you want to pay by
contacting your branch or our card centre.''
At the Royal Bank of Scotland around 10% of Access and Visa customers
have taken up the option of paying the minimum or full bill each month
by direct debit since it was introduced five years ago.
While paying by direct debit is clearly a useful option for those who
aim to repay in full each time, there must be a nagging doubt about
higher costs in the future. Over the past few years card issuers have
attempted to make money out of good payers who used to get off Scot free
by introducing annual fees, typically #10 or #12.
If wider promotion of direct debit repayment encourages even more to
follow suit then card issuers may seek to recoup the interest they stand
to lose by pushing up annual fees.
It may also encourage more banks to follow the Royal Bank's move
nearly two years ago and launch cards without any interest-free credit.
On the Royal's special MasterCard interest is payable even if the bill
is cleared in full each month, but at a much lower rate than cards which
offer up to 56 days free credit. And at a current rate of 14.5% it also
undercuts most personal loans.
Save &amp; Prosper/Robert Fleming, well-known for innovative moves on
credit cards, is planning to launch a similar card in October. The
interest rate is expected to be about 5% above bank base rate. Base rate
is currently 6.75% and according to S&amp;P that means a yearly APR of 12.4%
for its new card -- roughly half the charge on most major cards and much
cheaper than a personal loan. There is, however, no interest-free period
so, like the Royal Bank's Mastercard, it is strictly for cardholders who
don't pay off in full.
Also ahead lie plans by the Royal to provide tailor-made credit cards
to fit individual borrower's financial circumstances through more
sophisticated direct marketing techniques.
''The aim is to cut out the cross subsidisation you get where
borrowers pay higher interest rates because so many other customers pay
off in full each month,'' says Andrew Waldman, the Royal's director of
card services.
''The big card issuers don't change their interest rates very much
because they want to keep their margins as high as they can. We see an
opportunity to increase our share of the credit card market on smaller
profit margins.''

ALL being well later today, and depending on a dodgy hamstring, one of
Scottish sprinting's fastest men should turn out on the left wing for
Livingston rugby club against Hutchesons-Aloysians.
Elliot Bunney, a self-effacing man if ever there was one, has made the
transition from international sprinting to rugby, and although he
refuses to come out and say it, I rather suspect that there is some
ambition there.
Bunney, European junior 100 metres champion as a teenager, and with a
time of 10.20 sec. to his credit subsequently refused to enter the drug
culture as others did, and therefor had to watch as men he had once
beaten surged past him. It does not take a genius to spot that many in
athletics have got away with drug abuse. It is a well-publicised fact
that Bunney was never for that course.
''I suppose I was fed up not enjoying athletics,'' said Bunney. ''I
realised that I wasn't going to win any medals doing 10.30, a trip to
the Commonwealth Games every four years was hardly compensation, and I
kept on getting injured. Those injuries disappeared, though, when I went
to rugby training, and what I am doing at Livingston I am enjoying.
''I never played much rugby at school, and it's only now that I
realise all there is to rugby, because I wasn't brought up with the game
and I wish I had started earlier.''
When we talk pace, let's just say that The Herald's athletics man,
Doug Gillon, reckons that Bunney would take two yards off Welsh sprinter
and winger Nigel Walker over 60 metres, and, if he played, he could well
be the fastest man in world rugby.
Bunney, who is now a trainee sports development officer with West
Lothian Development Corporation, lets slip that his pace has brought a
few enquiries from bigger clubs. ''I have had a few offers, from Heriots
and Edinburgh Accies, but no-one has been to see me,'' he says. ''I
would be happier if they wanted to see me and then make up their minds.
At the moment I'm enjoying Livingston, but if I did want to take it up
seriously then I would of course consider moving.''
First Bunney will have to learn the details of the game, something
that few who haven't played rugby realise. He is 13st 4lb, which is not
light by any standards, but compare that to Jonah Lomu, who is 19st, and
you will see the strides he still has to make.
''I play on the left wing, which lets me come off my right foot to go
round men. Maybe I try to go around men too often,'' he says. ''But the
hard things to learn are the running angles and the alignment as a back
division. I find that I creep up on the pass and have to slow down to
take the ball.''
Pace, like fitness, may be vital in a modern, contact sport, but
taking his self-deprecation to the extreme, Bunney says that even his
level of speed can sometimes only show itself at the margins.
''There's no doubt that I could embarrass most of the guys on a track
in running shoes,'' added Bunney. ''But once you put your boots on in
the mud and rain, then there is quite a difference.
We have some fast guys at the club, and in rugby kit there isn't much
of a difference. I still train four times a week, but rugby training is
different and I'll be honest and say that I find it hard at times. There
is far more emphasis on aerobic work, which I am not used to, and I
think that we train quite hard as a club.''
You can run fast, you can have all the running angles worked out, and
you can have practised the moves to the death, but rugby is the kind of
game that tests your mettle by involving you not only in all of those
aspects, but then expecting you to get involved in the physical stuff at
the end of it.
Bunney may run 60m, yes in the mud and the rain, but he may be
expected to clatter into somebody at the end of it as well. Does he
enjoy the contact part of the sport? ''I don't mind the physical side at
all,'' he said. ''In fact I like it. It's just part of the game. I
suppose people expect me, having been an athlete, to shy away from the
rough stuff, and I get a fair bit of abuse on the pitch from some of the
opposition if I miss a tackle, but it's good. It's not a problem.''
He may not think that he has problems, but I would say that the sooner
he gets the best in coaching the better. He knows the commitment needed
in modern rugby is every bit as much as top-level football, and, at 28,
time isn't on his side.
Clubs like Livingston have always produced good players. Alex Moore,
who played for Edinburgh Accies and Scotland, was one recent one, and
even he felt the need to move on to get to the highest level.
Livingston are an ambitious club. They had a good season last year,
but, and I believe this, they are harbouring a little potential lump of
dynamite in Elliot Bunney. Now, he may not end up the best rugby player,
he may not end up an international rugby player, but I think we should
give him a chance as a country.
I'd like to see some time and resources put into a bloke like Bunney
to see if he could make the grade. If he wants it, that is. Murrayfield
should pluck at him and give it a go. We would be crazy to have possibly
the fastest rugby player in the world in our back yard and not take him
to the limit.

Michael Fry, continuing his contemporaneous accounts of the Jacobite
campaign, witnesses the bloody and brutal spectacle of Prestonpans,
which poses the most serious threat yet to the House of Hanover
EDINBURGH, September 23 -- Prince Charles Edward Stewart appears to be
the master of Scotland after his stunning victory over Sir John Cope at
Prestonpans.
At dawn two days ago, the Jacobites launched a surprise attack on the
King's army, camped in fields outside the East Lothian village. It was
routed within 10 minutes after a ferocious charge by the yelling
clansmen. Cope fled down the road to Berwick, leaving more than 2000
soldiers to their fate.
They broke and ran, to be pursued and cut down by the merciless
Highlanders. An eyewitness described the battlefield as a ''spectacle of
horror, being covered with heads, legs, and arms and mutilated bodies''.
Estimates put Cope's losses at 350 killed and 1700 taken prisoner,
including 70 officers. Jacobite casualties amounted to a handful.
The Government's attempt to recapture Edinburgh has thus ended in
humiliation. The city was occupied by the Jacobites on September 17, the
same day as Cope landed at Dunbar with his troops, which he had shipped
from Aberdeen after failing to corner the rebels in the North. They not
only came too late, but have suffered a disgraceful defeat. This is now
the most serious challenge to the House of Hanover since its succession
in 1714.
The Government in London has no further means of immediately quelling
the Jacobite uprising. Its garrisons are holding out in the castles of
Edinburgh and Stirling, and in a few forts in the North. But otherwise
there is nothing in Scotland, and little enough to stop the prince
invading England, if he can expand his army. He is likely to halt in
Edinburgh for some time while he takes stock. Having taken up residence
at Holyrood Palace, he is acting as ruler of the country. He has
appointed governors of the captured burghs and started to collect taxes.
He is already attracting a stream of recruits after his astounding
successes of the past week. The defence of Edinburgh was farcical,
because the two regiments left by Cope in the Lowlands manoeuvred
without attempting to fight the Highland army. On the night of September
16, the capital fell to a ruse. While the main body of the clansmen
stood to arms on its western approaches, Charles sent 800 of them under
cover of darkness round to the east. They took up a position outside the
walls near one of the gates, the Netherbow Port.
This detachment, under Donald Cameron of Lochiel, only had to await
its chance. In an act of incredibly casual folly, the gate was opened to
let out a coach, the same as had earlier carried the city fathers to
negotiate with the prince at Slateford. The clansmen rushed in and, as
the sun rose, Edinburgh was theirs without a drop of blood spilt. With
bloodcurdling cries, they ran up the High Street to seize the
guardhouse, where there was no resistance.
But their behaviour has since been restrained and disciplined. Charles
evidently means to impress on the capital that he has come not as its
conqueror but as its rightful prince. At noon on the first day of the
occupation, Lochiel formally took possession of the city for him. He
mustered his men on the High Street while the bells of St Giles tolled.
From the Cross the Ross Herald, accompanied by other members of the Lyon
Court in their splendid uniforms, proclaimed King James VIII, then read
out the prince's commission of regency and a manifesto of his political
aims.
The ceremony was carefully guarded, but a gathering of curious and by
no means hostile citizens formed round the military cordon. Lady Murray
of Broughton, wife of the prince's secretary, sat in their midst on
horseback, a drawn sword in her hand, wearing a white dress and handing
out white cockades to the spectators. Many waved white handkerchiefs in
support. Finally a salute was fired and pipers struck up a pibroch.
This was nothing to the jubilant scenes which later greeted Charles's
entry into the capital. In Highland dress, with a blue bonnet on his
head and the cross of the Order of St Andrews on his chest, he stood
some time in the King's Park to show himself to the people, then mounted
his horse to ride to Holyrood Palace. His progress turned into a
triumphal procession, cheered by a huge crowd, from which many pressed
close to the prince to touch his boots or bridle.
On reaching the gates of Holyrood, he dismounted and was let into the
home of his forefathers by James Hepburn of Keith, a veteran of the
rebellion of 1715, holding his sword aloft.
Celebrations continued into the night. More crowds surged about the
streets and gathered in front of the palace, applauding the prince's
appearances at a window. Prominent Jacobites, and a succession of
fashionbable ladies, arrived to be presented.
That evening, Charles was told Cope had landed at Dunbar. ''Has he, by
God?'' he replied. He and his chiefs at once prepared for the trial of
strength they'd been seeking. The Jacobites were still ill-equipped. At
best they carried old guns or longswords, and some were armed only with
pitchforks, scythes lashed to poles and rusty Lochaber axes.
A proclamation demanded surrender of all firearms in the city. It
yielded some powder and ball and about 1200 muskets, some serviceable,
some ''indifferent''. Clothes and shoes were also collected for the
ragged and often barefoot Highlanders.
On the morning of September 20, Charles reviewed his army to the sound
of bagpipes at Duddingston. With the chiefs at his side, he gave a
confident, uplifting speech, drawing his sword and telling his soldiers
he had flung away the scabbard. He promised to make them with God's help
a free and happy people.
''Mr Cope,'' he added, would not escape this time. They cheered
lustily and set out in good heart.
Cope was believed to be heading for Tranent, to take up a position on
the braes to the west. The Highlanders raced to intercept him, and
reached the village before nightfall. They camped amid the stubble of
the fields, protected only by their plaids on a chill and misty night.
Their leaders meanwhile argued over tactics and over the position of the
various clans in the line of battle, since several claimed the place of
honour on the right. But Charles was in exuberant spirits as he dined on
soup and meat at the inn in Tranent.
The landlady had hidden her pewter in case it was stolen by clansmen,
so he and his companions had to make do with two wooden spoons between
them.
The prince then held a council of war, after hearing that Cope had
preferred to advance some way to the north, over low ground between the
villages of Preston and Seton. His troops bivouacked that night along
the road between the two villages, warmed by great fires round the camp,
which was protected on one side by the sea and on the other by a morass.
This well-chosen position presented a problem to the Jacobites. It was
solved by the appearance of a sympathiser, Robert Anderson, son of a
local farmer, who offered to show them an unguarded path through the
morass. During the night, 1200 Highlanders crept silently in single file
along it. Under the command of Lord George Murray, they were able to
form up just 200 yards to the east of the King's army without being
opposed or even observed.
By the time Cope's soldiers awoke to what was happening, it was too
late. He could scarcely form them up for battle before the assault got
under way with a ''hideous shout''. He had his infantry in the centre
with cavalry on the flanks. The clansmen struck at the horses' noses, so
that they bolted round and threw their whole squadrons into disorder.
The 13th Light Dragoons did not even manage to fire one shot at their
attackers. The 14th Light Dragoons stood for 30 seconds under the
onslaught. In their panic-stricken flight they rode down the artillery
guard. The gunners had already fled. The infantrymen in the centre were
unsupported as the Highlanders set about slaughtering them. Charles
afterwards commented that this was ''one of the most surprising actions
that ever was''.

SELL in May and go away says the old Stock Exchange adage. Investors
were advised to return to the market on Leger Day which always falls in
September.
Superstitions die hard, particularly those which have been handed down
from generation to generation, but this is one which nowadays has a
large question mark over it. Recent research has suggested September is
not a particularly good month for London or Wall Street -- although
current performance does not underpin that too well.
But what would the person who quit the market in May have missed? If
our mythical investor had taken this drastic action in the middle of the
month he would have sold out when the Footsie 100 index was bobbing
around 3300.
New York was more volatile with the Dow Jones Industrial Index moving
around 4420 and the more widely followed Standard and Poors Composite
Index fluctuating around 520 as investors wondered how long the US, in
its fifth year of economic upturn, could retain its impressive strength.
In Japan the Topix was around 1280. Ten-year bond yields were 8% in the
UK, 6.6% in the US and 6.8% in Germany.
Assuming our investor opted for a tranquil summer, convinced he had
done the right thing and stopped reading the newspapers, which is never
sensible, he would have missed the suggestion that research now
demonstrates June is a good month for London, although a bad one for New
York.
If he had followed the standard advice that some cash should always be
kept in a readily available place such as a building society account,
and he had had the foresight to have chosen the National &amp; Provincial
Society two years earlier, he would have missed reading that he should
next year become at least #500 richer through the takeover bid from
Abbey National.
He would also have missed the start of five-day rolling share
settlement, which is something we all have to get used to, and the
successful start-up of the Alternative Investment Market, which is now
prompting the launch of new tax efficient venture capital trusts.
The old sell in May advice was based on the feeling that the summer is
-- or used to be -- a quiet time in the share markets when prices could
well drift downwards and not very much would be happening while people
took their holidays. It was, however, not quiet at all. Electricity
shares, for instance, were hard hit by the Regulator's latest tightening
up and then switched on again by takeover bids both actual and rumoured.
What else happened? Well, John Major calmed market jitters over an
early election by successfully (for the time being anyway) getting
himself reconfirmed as Tory party leader. The Government also changed
the tax rules on gilts, corporate bond PEPs started up at last and
Lloyds Bank paid over its #1800m purchase money for the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, starting a rush of account opening in other building
societies which may or may not get taken over or float on the market.
Returning in mid-September, the investor who sold in May would have
found he missed a gain of more than 230 points on the Footsie, 360
points on the Dow Jones, more than 60 points on the Standard and Poors
Composite and in Japan some 200 on the Topix.
It's a powerful argument for ignoring the sell in May advice and also,
given the fact that markets did not move in an unbroken straight line,
for paying regular monthly sums into investment or unit trust savings
schemes.
When major markets, not Japan of course, are at or near all-time highs
there is inevitably the worry that they may be about to break downwards.
Political jitters if nothing else will return to the UK sometime between
now and the General Election deadline of 1997. Again, the regular
investor gets the benefit of buying more cheaply when prices fall.
For what it is worth, brokers are generally expecting UK companies to
increase their earnings per share by some 13% this year against 18% last
year, and forecasts for next year show continued growth ranging from
around 6% to 10%. This year's dividends are likely to show an overall
growth of some 9%, similar to last year, but slow down a point or two
next year.
Broker Smith New Court in its September economic outlook predicts
10-year gilts will end the year yielding 7.5% and that yields will fall
a shade to 7.3% by the end of next year. It is optimistic on inflation,
predicting that the underlying rate of retail price inflation will be
2.75% or a little lower by the end of next year. That would give 10-year
gilts a ''real'' yield of just over 4.5%.
Meanwhile, for the cautious investor looking for a low-risk corporate
bond PEP, Whittingdale is launching one which it says should provide an
initial gross yield of 7.25%.
For the more adventurous investor, NatWest Securities points out
that after a poor start to the year, the Australian market is showing
encouraging signs of turnround. It likes the look of NM Smaller
Australian Companies Investment Trust and TR Far East Income Trust which
has some 29% of its investments in Australia.

THE big talking points this week are foreign players and English cash.
There's been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the number of Southern
Hemisphere players who have popped up in Scottish rugby this season.
Firstly, we have to keep the thing in perspective. There's just a bit
more than a couple of dozen in the entire Scottish game, so we're not
being exactly swamped.
However, when you look at the number of New Zealanders playing at
Watsonians then it becomes easier to understand why they led the charge
when the SRU tried to bring in restrictions at the annual general
meeting three months ago.
There are arguments for and against allowing overseas players to take
part in our game, and I have to admit that I don't really know what the
answer is. It's not even as if it's one-way traffic. To name just two,
Mike Dods and Gregor Townsend have spent the summer in New Zealand and
Australia, and I'm sure that they will come back better players.
The argument for restricting or banning foreigners over here is that
it keeps home-bred youngsters out of the top sides. You could argue that
if the available talent was good enough then there would be no point in
clubs sending an SOS to the Southern Hemisphere to cover up the
deficiencies at home. You could argue, too, that our players will learn
from the incomers and there's some truth in that, but only if the
incomers are good players in the first place.
However, the only way that our young players are going to improve is
if they are exposed to top-level rugby, and I can just imagine how a
young forward in the Watsonians second or third XVs must be feeling when
he sees that his path to the first XV is barred by a bunch of New
Zealanders.
If the guy is ambitious then he'll just move to another club where he
is guaranteed first XV rugby, even if that means he has to move down a
division.
The news that Sir John Hall's first recruit to his Newcastle-Gosforth
side is England's Rob Andrew must be sending shock waves through the
English game. Sir John obviously means business. Money talks and if
Newcastle are going to buy their way towards becoming the top club in
Europe -- and that is the plan -- then even clubs like Bath and
Leicester must be wondering what they have to do to compete.
Sir John has come into the game from soccer and, no doubt, he will use
the expertise that has got Newcastle United to the top of the English
game to do the same in rugby. The bufties at Twickenham had better watch
out because I've no doubt that he will be gunning for them if they try
to enforce their ruling of a moratorium on player-payments at club
level, or if they insist on restrictions on the playing of non-English
qualified players.
He wants Newcastle to rule the roost in the new European championship.
He won't do that unless he gets the entire England team playing on
Tyneside or if he recruits from all over the British Isles and beyond.
Scottish sides take part in Europe next season and, however much it
grieves me to say it, Scottish club sides just wouldn't be at the races.
Just now there are 40-odd players in the national squad. I'd create two
teams from the squad and they would fly the Scottish flag in Europe.
And finally, I was doing some missionary work with Colin Thomson, the
SRU's development officer in Stirling earlier this week. We went down to
darkest Cornton, an area which hasn't proved fertile rugby territory.
There were just a handful of kids to begin with but they went away and
chapped some doors and soon we had about 30 boys taking part in a skill
session.
''That's great,'' I said, ''and what haven't you done,'' referring to
the fact that they hadn't dropped a ball. ''Nobody's nicked anything
yet,'' said one wee boy at the back. I was speechless.

THE Government rejected suggestions contained in a report on the
future of healthcare published this week which called for the
introduction of charging in the NHS. Health Minister Stephen Dorrell
said the Government remained ''deeply committed'' to the NHS and
believed that access to healthcare ''should not be determined by the
size of someone's wallet''.
Yet many people already feel that paying for treatment can improve
their position and have taken out private medical insurance to cover the
cost.
The main attractions of buying insurance are that it enables you to
avoid waiting lists and gives you more say about when you are admitted.
It can also give you some choice over the hospital where you stay and
the consultant who treats you.
A recent Gallup survey conducted on behalf of private medical insurer
Prime Health found that Scots are particularly keen on this type of
insurance. One in four have private medical cover, which is as many as
in the London area. Only 19% of Scots without insurance felt they had no
need for it. A more common reason was because they felt they couldn't
afford it.
Generally, though, Scots were less concerned about cost than about
getting better cover when it came to choosing or changing a policy. The
majority were prepared to pay extra for a more comprehensive one.
Choosing a private medical insurance policy is not easy. There is an
increasing variety to choose from, from budget schemes which pay out
only if NHS waiting lists are more than six weeks long to
top-of-the-range plans that cover the cost of all your private treatment
plus extras such as dental work. There are also more providers. Banks,
building societies and brokers are now offering policies alongside the
more traditional provident associations and insurance companies.
Budget plans have become more popular in recent years but even here
the cover provided is not all the same. For example, many do not pay for
any out-patient treatment such as consultations, tests or diagnostic
procedures unless they are linked to in-patient treatment. Paying for
them yourself can be costly.
More comprehensive policies leave fewer gaps in your cover. Prime
Health, the UK's fifth largest health insurer, which was acquired last
year by Standard Life, has just revamped its comprehensive policy. It is
also conducting a #3m campaign to demystify private medical insurance.
Prime Health claims its Primecare policy is able to offer
comprehensive cover at budget prices -- for example, a couple aged 40
would pay #577 per year -- because it has specialised in selling
personal policies rather than the less profitable company ones. The
choice of hospitals it provides is more limited than with some schemes
but you are covered for out-patient treatment including physiotherapy,
alternative medicine, home nursing, daycare surgery and pregnancy
complications.
Cover for pre-existing medical conditions can be a problem when you
take out a new policy or want to switch insurers. Under the Primecare
policy, conditions which you suffered in the past five years will be
covered providing they do not reoccur for two years after you take it
out.
Moving with the times, Prime Health has recently established a
telephone direct sales and advisory service in Stockport. Cover can be
organised over the phone and staff can advise on whether the
circumstances are right to switch from another insurer. But Prime Health
is not the only company to offer medical insurance over the phone. Sun
Alliance has also started selling its range of schemes this way.
One of the most recent entrants to the private medical insurance
market is London-based financial services company Johnson Fry. Its new
comprehensive policy, Johnson Fry Healthsave, uses a procedure of
pre-negotiating the costs of every stage of planned treatment
procedures. The company argues that this approach, which is used
extensively in the US, will help hold its claims costs down, in turn
enabling it to keep its premiums more competitive over time.
Always check the list of exclusions before taking out a policy. No
private medical insurance policy will cover you for illnesses which are
chronic, that is long-term or incurable conditions. Other typical
exclusions include wilful self-inflicted injuries, illnesses caused by
alcohol or drug dependence, Aids, kidney failure, cosmetic surgery and
normal pregnancy. If you have had medical treatment for a condition in
the past, check how the insurer will treat a claim if it recurs in the
future.
A review of private medical insurance policies appears in this month's
Which? magazine outlining the different sorts and how they work. It
concludes that as long as the NHS provides a free service, this type of
insurance is a luxury purchase. For how much longer remains a matter of
speculation.

* On July 1, the Under the Hammer article talked about two sailors'
valentines made of seashells which Phillips were selling in Edinburgh,
and showed the picture of one which was expected to sell for around
#500.
In the event, it fetched #1350, and the article attracted the notice
of an 82-year-old lady living in Glasgow who owned a very similar
valentine.
It had been given to her mother in Jamaica in 1904. The corners of the
wooden case were decorated with tiny crabs and the interior filled in
with multi-coloured shells.
As the result of a letter from her to Phillips, this valentine too is
to be sold in Edinburgh on Friday, and the auctioneers are hoping for an
equally high price.

PROFESSIONAL Geordie, visionary, entrepreneur, autocratic egotist,
ruthless businessman with a social conscience, extremely good company
and rich, very rich.
All of the above apply when describing Sir John Hall, the Tyneside
millionaire and chairman of Newcastle United who has sent shock waves
through the rugby establishment by investing millions in
Newcastle-Gosforth, a middle-ranking Division 2 club, with the intention
of turning them into Europe's top side within five years.
On Thursday, Hall, a high-voltage 62-year-old, played the first card
of what he is convinced is a winning hand when he signed up England
fly-half Rob Andrew -- on a contract said to be worth between
#500,000-#750,000 -- as Newcastle-Gosforth's new director of rugby
development, for which read player-manager.
The deal, which assuredly means sleepless nights for the rugby
establishment, and which saw Newcastle-Gosforth transformed into
Newcastle Rugby Club Ltd, running under the aegis of Sir John's
Newcastle Sporting Club dream (football, ice-hockey with Durham Wasps,
athletics, and now rugby), was finally signed only this week, and it was
two Scots who were the conduit between the rugby club and St James's
Park.
Derek Balfour (ex-Watsonians) and David Campbell (ex-Kelso) were the
Newcastle-Gosforth men who beat a path to Sir John just 24 hours after
the International Rugby Football Board decreed in Paris that the
amateurism regulations were to be scrapped.
He was interested, but when you ask him why, he wants to take you back
to the beginning. He will tell you that he travelled Europe with his
wife looking at the sporting club concept operating in the likes of
Lisbon and Barcelona.
Once he had bought into Newcastle United (''at one point we were in
for #14m'') he wanted to develop an all-embracing sporting club
structure at St James's Park along the lines of Benfica, Real Madrid,
and Sporting Lisbon.
The man who arrived on the national stage with his Tyneside Metro
Centre development adds: ''I have a love of sport. The North East of
England has a passion and culture for sport. With United, the challenge
was there and when you are an entrepreneur it is the challenge that
keeps you going. You cannot fail. You have to understand the nature of
the entrepreneur. I'm a visionary and I want to bring this vision to the
rugby side as part of the sporting club concept.
''It was a pre-war fascist thing to keep the people's mind off
revolution. They gave them a hierarchy of sport built around the profit
centre of the football club. They had a family of sport. I thought that
was a great idea for the North East of England so I started to extoll
the virtue of it.''
But Sir John is, too, part social engineer. ''We are fighting here for
the North East. We're a bit like Scotland. We're fighting for the
Geordie nation. We are as proud of being Geordies as you Scots are of
being Scots men and women.
''The sporting club was the final piece of the jigsaw. Ice hockey
presented itself. Durham Wasps. They were going nowhere. They came to us
and we brought them in and now we have the best team in the UK and we'll
get into Europe.
''Then two weeks ago the rugby came along. I didn't predetermine it.
They came to us. There was that one moment in time and we seized it,''
he says.
However, he would not have been interested in an amateur game. ''We
are professional people and want to be part of professional sport.
''We signed the deal on Wednesday. They are now part and parcel of a
new company called Newcastle Rugby Club, of which we have 76%. We will
fund it and we will push it and sell the game.''
There is a huge war chest of cash available to Andrew but it is only
when Sir John warms to his theme of what professionalism really means
that the alarm bells will start ringing at Twickenham and, maybe,
Murrayield, too.
''Do you understand what professionalism means? You cannot run it with
the amateurs in charge any more. You have to have full-time,
professional administration.
''At national level, there has been no contact from anybody at
Twickenham but they must see us as a threat. We are coming into a game
which doesn't have a lot of cash in it. I would never have invested in
an amateur sport because I would never have let an amateur hold my
money. If you can have a say in the business of rugby then you will
invest in it, but you want some control as a pay-off for the money that
you have invested.''
And this is where it gets interesting. What does Sir John mean by
control? ''You cannot decide in principle to go professional, open the
floodgates, and then close them again. You cannot be half-pregnant. You
have to embrace it wholeheartedly.
''The authorities, like the Rugby Football Union, will have to sit
down with the clubs and talk. The professional game, as in soccer, must
rule the professional game. The professional game must structure itself
and the professional clubs have got to get organised with their own,
professional management. They have to maximise their potential and their
income.
''In a sense, what rugby needs, like the Football Association in
soccer, is a consultative body, a joint body for the game looking at
what needs to be done. The FA are custodians of the soccer game in
England but the new professional clubs in rugby, again just like soccer,
are the ones who will make the changes in the game.''
''The RFU will organise the English national side. I would rather that
was under the professional game as well, but probably the clubs won't
have time to do that.
''For the moment, the RFU will continue to run the England team but
even that will have to be done in conjunction with the clubs. Listen, if
the clubs sign contracts with the players, as they will, and those
players are legally bound to the clubs then it would be very difficult
for the RFU to have contracts with the players as well unless they were
in agreement with the club contracts. You cannot have two contracts. You
cannot serve two masters.''
That, then, is an early shot across the bows of the the rugby
establishment, early warning of possible stormy waters ahead. ''If the
English national -- any national team -- is successful then the game
will be successful, but there has to be a rapport between the RFU, and
other national bodies, and the clubs. It is inevitable that in a
professional game, there will be a downgraded role for the Rugby
Football Union and that the professionals will run the professional
game.''
''This might upset them at Twickenham but what am I supposed to do.
I'm in the market place. I'm tremendously excited by the whole thing.
I'm excited by the prospect of European rugby and being in a European
league. That is the challenge. Europe is the next frontier. That and
100,000 members of our family of sport.
We are revolutionaries. Newcastle Gosforth will be No.1. They have to
be. That's the dream, the mission statement. In the next five years
Newcastle Rugby Club has to be one of the top clubs in Europe.''

James Robertson remarks that, against the run of history, the losers
in the Rebellion still managed to end up with all the best tunes.
IT IS inevitable that the trophies of war are picked up by the
bloodied hands of the winner after the final clash, and that must have
been the way of it following the utter crushing of the Stuart dynasty's
cause on Culloden field. Likewise, according to logic, it is the victor
who enjoys the prerogative of having his deeds put to song for the ears
of later generations long after the din of battle has died.
There could not have been much in the way of treasure and other
material plunder to be had when the Hanoverian forces slaughtered and
harried Charlie's supporters in 1746. Few among the winners can have
marched home with more than the odd souvenir to show for their deeds.
Merely some evidence to support tales of what daddy did in the war -- if
the plunderer could be bothered to carry his booty that far.
But at least the heroes who saved the British throne for German George
and his descendants in the last pitched battle fought on the soil of the
United Kingdoms could march home consoled by the knowledge that their
demolition of the Stuart threat would go down in history forever -- and
that their glorious actions were bound to inspire countless compositions
that would survive the centuries in song.
Let's hope, for the sake of their souls, including those of the many
Scots who fought against the Jacobite horde, that they were not relying
on such an epitaph. Otherwise, they must be spinning in their graves. To
the victor the spoils, certainly. But in the case of the Forty-five, it
is the propaganda of the losers that has survived to be sung to this
day, and particularly this year, the 250th anniversary of the launch of
the ill-starred adventure.
Nobody is singing the praises of the conquerors in 1995.
It seems to have been the way of it for quite some time. The Stuarts'
foes have long been denied much favour from the musical muse. A history
of the Scottish Highlands which appeared in the 1870s, edited by John S
Keltie, F S A Scot, devoted a fair amount of space to the ''outburst''
of Jacobite song and the paucity and poverty of those dedicated to the
victors. But why the huge imbalance?
Perhaps something can be learned from the authors of this particular
history, writing as they were a lot closer in time to the Forty-five. A
section devoted to Jacobite songs speaks of ''some hundreds'' -- many of
which, of course, are still sung lustily to this day and by no means all
of them the products of post-Culloden romanticism and sentimentality --
and of the Whig songs being ''very few''.
And those few it describes as ''artificial and cold, altogether devoid
of the fire, the point, the perfect abandon, the touching tenderness,
the thorough naturalness which characterise those of their opponents''.
Those historians of the third quarter of last century suggest that
supporters of the Stuart cause were only too aware of their limitations
and were folk who, ''unable to show their loyalty by their deeds'',
found an outlet for their energy in anti-enemy songs.
The authors bring Burns into it, pointing to his remark that the Muses
were all Jacobites, and reach the conclusion themselves that all the
best songwriters of the country enlisted on ''the unfortunate side''.
Their critique of Jacobite songs -- some originally penned in Gaelic,
others in the Scottish tongue -- in comparison with those of the
opposition was very much in line with the opinions of earlier
researchers General David Stewart of Garth and James Hogg, the Ettrick
Shepherd.
The General, in his Stewart's Sketches of 1822, a fruitful source of
insight into the Highland way of life in the eighteenth century, had
this to say: ''It is beyond question that the merit of these Jacobite
songs eclipsed, and still eclipses, every attempt at poetry on the other
side, which has produced little beyond a few scraps of verse in ridicule
of the bare knees, the kilts and bad English of the Highlanders''.
Some of those quoted in the Victorian-age history are still familiar
-- among them Maclean's Farewell, The White Cockade, Charlie is my
Darling, and Hey, Johnnie Cope. Others have probably never been aired,
except perhaps by academics, this century. One in that category is is
far removed from the sweet and tender variety. Cumberland and Murray's
Descent Into Hell, nine vitriolic verses of it, was dismissed by James
Hogg as ''horrible and so irresistibly ludicrous''.
Cumberland, of course, was the Butcher of Culloden himself. The Murray
referred to had been the Prince's secretary, but gave evidence against
his comrades in the trials that followed the Forty-five. The song in
which they are remembered, and which Hogg found so distasteful, delights
in the torment which the lyricist assumes they must be undergoing.
It describes Murray's fate in Satan's ''frything-pans'' luridly:
Auld Satan cleekit him by the spaul,
And stappit him i' the dub o' Hell,
The foulest fiend there doughtna bide him,
The damn'd they wadna fry beside him,
Till the bluidy duke came trysting hither,
And the ae fat butcher tried the tither.
In the interests of fairness, the historians of 120 years ago gave
space to one or two of ''the best'' Whig songs they could trace.
There is a litany which urges God to save the singers from ''the
lawless dominion of mitre and crown''. And, in the final verse:
From fools, knaves and villains, prerogative Tories,
From church that for the Babylon whore is,
From a pretended prince like pear rotten at core is,
From a court that has millions yet as old Job poor is.
If that is one of the best, it is no wonder that so few Whig songs
have stood the test of time or were even considered worthy of
publication in the first place.
Corries Ronnie Browne and the late Roy Williamson, of course, found
much material in the Jacobite songs to stir the blood. Ronnie suggests
that the survival of so many Jacobite songs could be related to the
Scots' tendency to side with the underdog.
One particular comment from the nineteenth-century historians on the
Jacobites and their failure might contain a lesson for Scotland in this
day and age. ''We think, had there been less singing and song-making and
more attention to stratagem and dry military business and diplomacy
generally, they would have been more likely ultimately to have placed
their idol on the throne,'' they suggested.
Does that mean that, if the Tartan Army and their heroes on the soccer
and rugby fields gave up singing Flower of Scotland, they would be
rewarded with more success in World Cup competitions?

THE Edwards clan are brothers in arms but on opposite sides of the
great divide at Meggetland today, as Boroughmuir seek to keep their
premiership challenge going while Stirling County endeavour to stop the
rot and set themselves up for their show-piece clash with the Barbarians
on Tuesday.
Brian of that ilk is the coach with the unenviable task of steering
County towards the calmer waters which a win today would represent.
Henry, meanwhile, whose side have logged three wins to County's one,
must hope for a reversal of fortune from last season, when Stirling
defeated Boroughmuir on the day that the championship was secured.
Yesterday, Henry declared -- as if there was any chance of such a
thing happening -- that no, he and Brian had not been exchanging notes
or thoughts, or in fact anything which might pertain to the business in
hand today.
''It's a big game for them but it's a big game for us as well,'' said
Henry. ''If we win then we've got Watsonians at home next weekend and
two wins would set us up nicely.
''We're taking nothing for granted. As a coach the worst thing that I
can do is say it's only Stirling and they're going through a bad spell.
Continuity is the thing that we've been aiming for at Boroughmuir and
we'll not achieve that be looking at any match as easy.
''Stirling have Kenny Harper back. He's a seasoned campaigner and
he'll make a difference.
In the past we've been guilty of letting our concentration slip and
losing games that we should have won but I've no doubt that Brian is
saying the same thing to his guys at Stirling this season.
''There are no easy games in this division. I know that's a cliche and
the kind of thing that coaches are supposed to say but it's true. To be
honest, I'd prefer a 10-team first division, but from a coach's point of
view the intensity of the eight-team division means that you don't have
to work too hard at pointing out to the boys that every game is a hard
game and that every game counts.''
Earlier this week one gained the impression that Brian was rather
wishing that Tuesday's Barbarians game could be got out of the way.
''It's been a bit of a distraction,'' he said. ''It's a big thing for
the club and for rugby in the Stirling area but, maybe, too many players
have had one eye on that match and concentration on the league has
suffered.''
Watsonians and Melrose, who head the premiership table with
Boroughmuir, are on duty today against, respectively, Hawick and
Edinburgh Academicals. Watsonians, who travel to Mansfield Park, hope to
have got last weekend's defeat by Melrose out of their system, according
to coach Peter Gallagher.
There is, too, the possibility that disenchanted Stewart's-Melville
prop Alan Kittle -- dropped after last weekend's 93-5 defeat by GHK --
might throw in his lot at Myreside.
Gallagher said: ''Alan turned up at training last night. He came to
look at our set-up and I said we would be delighted to have him, but I
explained that there was a lot of competition for front-row places and
the ball is now in his court.''
Last night Kittle, who toured with the Scotland development squad in
Zimbabwe during the summer and who was replaced as Stew-Mel captain
before the season had startet, said: ''I don't know where I will be
going. I just know I don't want to play at Inverleith. I was one of
those blamed for the defeat and I don't think that was fair.''

THE Tayside Athletics Development Initiative, IMPACT, celebrates
receipt of #20,000, half each from TSB and Sportsmatch, at Dundee's
Caird Park tomorrow with a squad session for under-17 athletes and
leading coaches.
The Tayside Sports Development Group, supported by the Scottish Sports
Council, Tayside Region, and the district councils of Dundee, Angus, and
Perth and Kinross, is putting #90,000 into a programme for eight sports
-- basketball, badminton, cricket, hockey, swimming, rugby, tennis and
athletics.
Ken McKay, the former four-time Scottish long jump champion, now the
region's sports development co-ordinator, has secured the additional
funding for athletics, first of the eight sports to gain additional
outside funds.

THERE was more bad news on Britain's trading performance yesterday
from the Balance of Payments figures for the second quarter which take
in overseas invisible earnings from financial services, overseas
investments, and tourism.
There was also a substantial adverse revision to the first quarter
current account. However, the Treasury took comfort from the final
second quarter GDP figures, also released yesterday, where growth was
unchanged on the preliminary estimates at 0.5% quarter-on-quarter and
2.8% year-on-year.
A Treasury spokesman said: ''The figure confirms growth is at a
sustainable rate.''
Britain's current account trade deficit in the second quarter, though,
grew to #2364m, the highest recorded since the first quarter of 1993.
Moreover, the first quarter deficit has now been revised upwards to
#1316m from an initial estimate of #400m. Market analysts said the
figures put paid to any lingering hopes that the UK would be in the
black on current account at the end of the year.
The visible trade balance deficit was #3238m in the second quarter
against #2019m in the first quarter reflecting a 4[1/2]% rise in the
value of imports while exports rose by just 1[1/2]%. The volume of
exports showed a decrease of 1% between the two quarters while the
volume of imports rose by almost 2%.
The figures confirm the trend in recent months of rising imports and a
decline in export growth.
But so far as the actual current account is concerned, a major
influencing factor, too, is a radical change in the first quarter figure
for invisible earnings where the original estimate of a contribution of
#1600m has now been reduced to just #703m. In the second quarter,
invisibles contributed #874m, less than expected.
Earlier in the year, there had been expectations that invisible
earnings would offset the growing trade gap in visible earnings but this
no longer looks probable on the basis of the 1995 first half. There is
still the possibility that further more favourable revisions in
invisibles later in the year could improve the current account picture
if not totally offsetting the growing visible trading gap, especially
against the non-EU countries.
And many economists believe that the trading performance will start to
improve shortly anyway as overseas markets strengthen, particularly the
US.
The Central Statistical Office says that changes to the first quarter
current account were largely due to revisions to data for investment
income and services caused by the receipt of late and revised returns to
quarterly inquiries.
Second quarter GDP, meanwhile, produced no surprises or dramatic
revisions to the headline numbers. James Capel's Adam Cole believes that
a build up of stocks in the second quarter -- the CBI's Industrial
Trends survey for September showed no abatement of this -- may extend
the recent pause in output growth into the second half of this year, but
1996 should see strong and accelerating growth return.
What GDP does indicate is that the weakness of the housing market is
resulting in a shift in consumer expenditure away from goods and towards
services. Real disposable income fell by 0.2% in the second quarter
following a 1.5% surge in the first quarter. But Cole interprets this as
reflecting no more than faulty seasonal adjustment.

BERNARD Gallacher admitted he had made an error in sending Bernhard
Langer and Per-Ulrik Johansson out again in the fourballs.
''They were three up with six to play, at about the time I had to hand
in my fourball pairings,'' explained Europe's captain. ''I had no doubts
then, but what I did not foresee was the stressful finish.
''I've told the players it was my fault and that's all there is to
it,'' added Gallacher. ''If I'd known then what I know now Ian Woosnam
and Philip Walton would have played.''
0 Woosnam and Walton are paired in today's foursomes. Gallacher has
persevered with Nick Faldo and Colin Montgomerie and also retained the
partnership of Sam Torrance and Costantino Rocca. He has given Bernhard
Langer a new partner in David Gilford.

THEY'RE a stylish and distinctive bunch, the latterday Indian-lovers.
They move with head-turning assurance. Their attitude to life can truly
be described as free-wheeling and well-rounded, like the prime objects
of their desire. Yet while they value appearances, they also value
practicality, albeit of an idiosyncratic sort. When they're at their
most carefree, at one with the summertime elements, the devotees of the
Indian are impossible not to envy.
They're easy to recognise, of course. For a start, there's the sound
which accompanies their passage, like rolling thunder. There's the way
they glide with a powerful disdain. Poetry in motion, man. Cool.
Commanding. Riding easy.
Oh -- and you'll also know them by the smears of greenfly across the
bridges of their noses. And the black squash of small flies which can
accrete between their teeth. That stuff happens a lot when the sun
shines. Because when you're aboard an Indian, you can't help but smile.
New-fangled crash-helmets with wimpy bug-catching plastic visors are
anathema to those who ride in the proper Indian fashion, you see.
Vintage open-faced jobs are the only form of headgear which will
suffice. Nothing needlessly modern. Older can be better, is the Indian
credo, the last all-new Indian motorcycle having left the factory in
Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1953. Ever since, the Indian legend has
been growing.
It blossoms fully every year at the international Indian rally,
generally held in Europe. This year's big one took place in Scotland in
July. A posse rode over from Germany, ferrying from Hamburg to
Newcastle, for the main two-day rally at Traquair House, Innerleithen. A
total of around 300 Indians roared in from all over continental Europe
and the UK, many of them ridden by mean-looking outlaw dudes sporting
leather jodhpurs and ferocious frontiersmen's beards.
Additionally, squads of American Indian-cultists temporarily forsook
their own chromed steeds in order to come over to Scotland and look at
those belonging to other people. All kinds of people comprise the Indian
tribe. From Seattle in bucolic Washington state there came Gerry and
Melinda Chinn. He's an art director for TV commercials; she's a
film-industry props mistress.
The pair viewed the conjunction of groovy Indians, groovier
Indianophiles, and picturesque Scottish scenery as positively
mind-blowing. ''Your rolling hills! The heather! That loch we saw! So
many bikes with their own individuality!'' Gerry exclaimed.
An equally awe-struck Reggie Sherman was over in Scotland from
California on what he described as ''the ultimate vacation.'' When he's
not grooving round Santa Clara on one of his five Indians, he's earning
his daily bread as a bus driver in Silicon Valley.
And despite having been a small boy long ago when the Indian company
was at the multi-million-selling height of its success, Chuck Garrett
continues to ride tall in the saddle at home in St Louis.
Chuck's love of Indians was sparked by his eldest son when the latter
began messing around with bikes as a teenager, back in the sixties.
These days Chuck has a working '48 Chief, plus two other models, another
Chief and a Scout, in a state of hopeful re-assembly. Fittingly, Chuck
has British bikes, too -- a '67 Norton Atlas and a '58 Indian Enfield.
It was British bikes, you see, which helped finish off the Indian
company.
''Indians were pretty reliable bikes, but the company was poorly
managed,'' Chuck revealed. ''They didn't keep up with the times in terms
of re-tooling the company properly after the Second World War, so their
production costs increased. When Indian did develop a new model, a
lighter European-style bike like the ones which had become fashionable
in the States in the early fifties, their traditional domestic market
didn't like it.''
Business rivals did their best to accelerate Indian's decline, too.
Harley Davidson muscled in on Indian's lucrative, hitherto-exclusive
police and military contracts. They also squeezed the components
suppliers that the two companies shared. As Indian approached its final
days as a working company, a British company, Brockhouse, bought its
nationwide chain of distributors. Soon afterwards, most of these outlets
ended up selling Harley Davidsons, just before Japanese manufacturing
efficiency scuppered virtually every American and British bike-builder
bar Harleys.
The Indian factory has long since been converted into low-rent
apartments. Indian-afficionados fight to keep the name and its spirit
alive.
So what is it about the Indian? Step forward Peter Williamson and Alan
Forbes, heroic Indian high priests. Crikey, Britain no longer has a
motorcycle industry of its own, but when it comes to motorcycle-worship,
these two demonstrate that we are in a league of our own.
In one of his lives Peter Williamson is simply the son-in-law of
sports broadcaster and football statistican Bob Crampsey. In another
life Peter runs a dance-oriented record label, Big Bang, plus
music-publishing and production companies. He once managed Bizarre Inc,
as well as having overseen the re-mixing of a Madonna single. And he's
building a new recording studio in Scotland which will employ
fashionably-retro solid-state technology of the type which has all but
been eradicated by digital equipment.
Years ago in yet another of his lives, long before he forsook the
humdrum town of Dudley in his native English Midlands, Peter was a
nuclear submariner in the Queen's Navy. It's strange to think that a
life beneath the ocean waves sparked Peter's love for two wheels on the
open road, as he explained: ''We were always in and out of US Navy ports
in the States. I'd always been a bike fanatic, and on one trip round
about 1979 I met this bloke in Charleston who had a barn full of old
bikes.
'' 'What are those things at the back, Harleys?' I asked him. They
were Indians. Six of them. After an afternoon being taught how to ride
them, I bought them all for $1000. I'd fallen in love with the
beautiful, sweeping lines that Indians have.'' Unwanted in the late
seventies, Indians are much prized these days. You can get a regular one
for #12,500. A nice one for #15,000. A rare corker for #40,000. Pay
anything less, and your Indian will be a literal basket-case, ie a pile
of disconnected pieces.
Peter uses one of his Indian sextet as a Glasgow daily driver. But
watchfully. His last everyday Indian suddenly vanished. ''I'd broken
down in Minard Road, on Glasgow's south side. I went away to phone for
help, came back, and the bike had been stolen. Months later it turned up
in South Africa. I haven't been able to get it back.''
Even had it been functioning properly, the bike would have been hard
for thieves to ride away. ''Compared to other bikes, Indians are back to
front. You've a left-hand throttle, a right-hand gear-change, a
foot-operated clutch. There's a priming procedure, as well as a manual
advance-and-retard set-up, a continual adjustment of the bike's timing
that you have to do as you ride.''
Indian-owners puzzled by the complexities of their machines are
advised to head for the bijou Edinburgh premises of Motolux, the
well-stocked Indian emporium which acted as an official focus for July's
rally and which is run by Alan Forbes. Like Peter Williamson, Alan is a
man with his own music-related range of lives, not the least of which
was his long stint as the elaborately-coiffed frontman of those
post-punk-popsters the Rezillos and their post-post-pop-punkabilly
successors, the Revillos.
With impeccable timing, Alan collects wondrous things that everyone
else is throwing away, blind to their lure, from Messerschmitt bubble
cars to model spaceships. In Alan's care, such objects magically resume
their previous status. Alan curently has 25-30 Indians of his own, ''not
all of them on the road, I must point out, and many of them on loan to
friends.
''A lot of US military Second World War Indians survived in east
Germany, behind the old Iron Curtain, where they were kept going because
there was no alternative. Ten years ago, people there would have swapped
them for a Honda 50. But when the Berlin wall came down in 1989, what
had been junk became treasure.'' Unsurprisingly, Alan has a thriving
partnership with an Indian store in Potsdam.
For one special week in July, though, the day-to-day trans-European
trade in Indian spares was largely suspended. After the Innerleithen
rally, Alan mounted up and joined 90-odd other bikes on a five-day
Indian tour of the Highlands. Their stately, sun-dappled journey to
Arisaig, Skye, Oban and beyond was filmed by Edinburgh-based independent
company Skyline and Berlin's Blueberry Films for BBC Scotland's Ex-S
series, as well as for two German TV companies.
How did this assembly of vintage motorcycles, some of them 60 years
old, survive the trip? To find out, you'll have to watch the Ex-S TV
show when it's broadcast towards the end of the year.
For despite having left me a veritable telephone-directory of mobile
phone numbers, the Indian tourists could not be contacted all week.
They're pesky 21st-century things, mobile phones, after all. And when
you're on an Indian, with the sun in your face and insects between your
teeth, you're somewhere perfectly timeless.

<TEXT>
NEW Australian heavyweight champion Joe Bugner has threw down a
challenge to IBF title-holder George Foreman.
Bugner returned after an eight-year absence to claim a unanimous
points decision against Vince Cervi to add the Australian crown to the
British, Commonwealth, and European titles he won in his 27-year
professional career.
The 45-year-old Bugner set his sights on Foreman, saying: ''I hope
George will now consider fighting me.''
Bugner used his left jab and right cross to good effect and held off a
brief tenth-round rally from Cervi to win by scores of 119-109, 119-111
and 117-111.

THE Murrayfield Debenture scheme, which has raised more than #32m to
finance construction of the new Murrayfield stadium -- making it
Europe's most successful sporting debenture operation -- comes to an end
on September 30.
The Scottish Rugby Union announced yesterday that debentures to the
value of #250,000 have been sold in the past seven days. About 700 of
the original 18,500 debentures still remain but they have to be taken up
within the next week. The remaining debentures are top of the range
hospitality packages and are on offer, say the SRU, at #3500 and #9900.
Details from the Scottish Rugby Union.

WILLIE McBrinn this afternoon will turn the clock back 25 years as the
Scottish Veteran Harriers Club host their track championships to mark
their 25th anniversary. The vets have orchestrated their trip down
memory lane, reverting to a cinder track at Hamilton's Bent Park.
They will run in the old fashioned way: linear distances, 100 and 220
yards, half a mile, mile handicap, and a showpiece six miles, for the
Andy Forbes Memorial Trophy.
Forbes won Empire Games silver at the distance in 1950, and advised
the young McBrinn to cut the toes out of the black Woolworth gym shoes
which were the favoured footwear of old. Shettleston's McBrinn was
rummaging for the old sannies last night, hoping to wear them today.
He collects old running shoes, and has umpteen pairs, so the task may
be beyond him. ''I've also got a magic show to do, so it will be a real
rush to get to Hamilton in time,'' he says.
McBrinn has put up a prize for the runner who turns out in the most
evocative nostalgic gear.

THE United States held a daunting, but by no means decisive lead over
Europe of two points, by 5-3 after the first day's play in the Ryder Cup
match yesterday at Oak Hill, Rochester. In a relentless deluge, the
foursomes were shared 2-2, but in cooler, breezier, and ultimately
brighter weather Europe lost the fourball games, in recent times their
strongest suit, by 3-1.
This was the first time since 1979 for the United States to take an
opening better-ball series. The linch-pin partnership of Colin
Montgomerie and Nick Faldo were twice found wanting and Sam Torrance and
Costantino Rocca and Bernhard Langer and Per-Ulrik Johansson could not
sustain the performances which had brought them foursomes wins.
But Severiano Ballesteros, emotionally charged, proved an inspiration
to David Gilford, much in need of a lift to morale after his unfortunate
baptism of fire four years ago. American captain Lanny Wadkins,
completely reshuffled his pack at lunchtime and gave all his players a
game, whereas Bernard Gallacher confined Ian Woosnam and Philip Walton
to idleness.
There could scarely be a greater contrast in character between
Ballesteros and Gilford, but the extrovert and the diffident dovetailed
exceptionally against Brad Faxon and Peter Jacobsen. Ballesteros, the
great motivator, bolstered Gilford's confidence by declaring to him on
the first tee that he was ''the best player out here today'', and his
partner responded with a personal score of two under. Ballesteros,
however, led the three-birdie run in six holes from the turn which won
the match.
Torrance and Rocca did not so much run out of steam as have the
stuffing knocked out of them by the putting of Loren Roberts. Making his
first appearance at the age of 40, Roberts had birdies at four of the
seven holes which he and Jeff Maggert combined to win with figures of
four under par against the Europeans' two over.
The last two games took, for European supporters, a similarly doleful
pattern. Montgomerie and Faldo, from whom so much was expected, even
released to play all their own shots, again made a faltering start, four
down after six holes to Davis Love and Fred Couples, the winners of the
last three World Cups successfully reunited.
The Europeans were two over and four down to two under at the turn.
Although Montgomerie holed putts of 10 and eight feet for birdie 3s at
the twelfth and fourteenth, that revival, as was their morning attempt
at a salvage operation, was snuffed out by a par at the short fifteenth.
There was to be no way back either for Europe's other winning
foursomes partnership. After the minimum rest allowed of 30 minutes
between games Langer and Johansson lost the first four holes, two of
them to a birdie apiece by Corey Pavin and Phil Mickelson, the first
left-hander to enter the lists on behalf of the United States.
In every way Wadkins must have been more reassured than Gallacher over
the day's golf.
For the second successive year and the fifth time in the last eight
matches, the sides shared the opening foursomes. The last match in which
the United States lost on the first morning was 22 years ago.
In the gloom, the tangerine shade of the Europeans' knitwear brought a
welcome burst of colour to the scene, to which the sombre greys of the
Americans' clothing made no contribution.
Torrance and Rocca took command by winning five successive holes from
the sixth, each in par, as the long games of Couples and Jay Haas
unravelled. Rocca, who had steadied himself by holding a five-foot putt
to half the first and recovering close from a bunker for Torrance to do
likewise at the next, continued to back up his vastly more experienced
partner and gain his first victory in three attempts over two matches.
There was a momentary period of apprehension when Couples and Haas
recovered their composure as to take three consecutive holes from the
twelfth. But that slide was halted at the short fifteenth, whose green
well below the tee Couples missed with his shot.
The other new partnership of Langer and Johansson appeared to have
taken command against Masters champion Ben Crenshaw and Curtis Strange
by winning three holes from the eighth -- the last of these with a
birdie 3, Langer holing a 40-foot putt.
The venerable partnership of Crenshaw and Strange, claiming 83 years
and seven other matches between them, was able at least to put a better
complexion on the outcome when the Europeans, as is so frequently the
case in foursomes, stumbled enough to lose all their lead with two
double bogeys and a bogey.
But Langer had the last word. Always remembered sympathetically for
having missed the six-foot putt by which America regained the Cup in
1991, the German painstaking and resourceful as ever ended a game
protracted by the need constantly to mop up greens by converting
Johansson's chip-and-run to a similar character-buidling distance for
the tying point.
Faldo and Montgomerie's cause seemed hopelessly lost when they stood
four down after only five holes. They took the next three from Pavin and
Tom Lehman and with a 35-foot putt for a birdie at the long thirteenth
Faldo squared the game. But the Europeans were destined never to lead.
Instead Faldo's swing and then his judgment betrayed him at the last.
He drove into deep rough from which his partner could only recover down
the fairway and his wedge shot approach flew the green into a bunker. By
contrast, from Pavin's safe drive Lehman's solid No.5 iron found the
pulpit green's heart and par took the hole and match.
Howard, Clark and Mark James, with no past foursomes form to speak of,
had that further reduced by the morning's best figures. Love and Jeff
Maggert won five of the first seven holes in four under par, were out in
31 and four up and when they closed out the game three holes from home
they were three under.

GOLF:
JULIE Forbes, from Aboyne, completed a second round of 70, three-under
par, to move into a share of the halfway lead with Australian Wendy
Doolan in the Maredo Open at Treudelberg, Hamburg, yesterday.
Forbes and Doolan finished at eight-under-par 138 with Dale Reid
boosting the Scottish challenge in a six-way share of second place on
139.
Forbes made her score over the par-5 holes. She holed from 18 feet for
a 4 at the fifth then chipped to six feet for another birdie at the
ninth. Forbes made another four at the long twelfth despite driving into
a fairway bunker, then holed her best putt of the day from 20 feet for a
closing birdie at the last. Her only loss to par was at the second,
where she three-putted.
Leading first-round scores (British or Irish unless stated):

* A JADED Scotland lost 9[1/2]-5[1/2] to holders England in their
final match in the home internationals at Royal Portrush yesterday to
allow their age-old rivals to retain their title. England tied with
Ireland on two wins each, but won on a countback of 25 matches won to
24[1/2].
Captained by former British Amateur champion Peter McEvoy, it was
their twenty-sixth victory in this series, which was first contested in
1932, and their fourth hat trick.
Only Scottish Amateur champion Simon MacKenzie, international rookies
Michael Brooks and Roger Beames, and undefeated Alan Reid won their
crucial afternoon singles ties following a 3-2 foursomes reversal.
Colin Dalgleish, the Scottish captain, said: ''It was very
disappointing, yet the quality of the golf from the English was
excellent. Barclay Howard was beaten by a score of seven under par from
David Howell. There were a few tired shots here and there this afternoon
and it is a sad way to end a successful season. Wecame here promising so
much.''

EXPANSION
EAST Kilbride-based labelling pioneer Donprint International is
setting up a manufacturing plant in Chicago, believing it can boost its
US sales from #1m to #5m within four years.
Its decision to start production in the States was announced yesterday
by Scottish Office Industry Minister George Kynoch, who was officially
opening Donprint's #1m-plus research and raw material production plant
on East Kilbride's high-tech Peel Park Campus.
Donprint, which supplies specialised identification labels for
computers and their components, video recorders and televisions, and
cars, plans to have two production lines up-and-running in Chicago by
the end of March.
Jumbo rolls of coated film, manufactured in East Kilbride, will be
shipped to the US, where they will be converted into labels.
Mr Kynoch said the US venture was a further example of Donprint's
commitment to maintain and improve its position as a successful
competitor on a worldwide basis.
Donprint's US expansion is the result of demand from electronics
giants which are customers on both sides of the Atlantic.
Donprint's customers in the US include Compaq in Texas, IBM in North
Carolina, Digital in New England, and Zenith in Chicago. The company
also supplies IBM and Zenith's Mexican operations.
Worldwide exports currently account for only about 15% of Donprint's
#13m annual turnover but will become increasingly important as US
production is ramped up.
Donprint has achieved average annual sales growth of 39% during the
last three years.
The company, which has increased its workforce by 45 during this
three-year period, employs 91 people at East Kilbride.
During the next three years it plans to invest another #3.5m and
anticipates the recruitment of another 50 staff in the UK.

AS teams in the lower divisions continue their league programmes this
afternoon, many club officials will be wondering what the future holds
for them in view of the threatened changes to the transfer system and
their main source of income.
Forfar's six-figure cheque for the transfer of David Bingham to
Dunfermline could be one of the last such sizeable entries on the credit
side of the ledger. They travel to Berwick today as the surprise packets
of the second division, having strung together four wins since they lost
the opener to the team sharing top place with them, East Fife. The
Fifers will be at full strength for their home encounter with Queen of
the South.
Stenhousemuir have signed influential midfielder Colin Scott from East
Stirlingshire and he is likely to be included for the short trip to
Broadwood, where Clyde add Graham Watson and Ian Nisbet to their squad.
Ayr United travel to Montrose for a bottom-of-the-table encounter. The
visitors will be without John Sharples and Greg Hood.
Stirling Albion manager Kevin Drinkell is wary about the long trip to
Stranraer, now the home side have begun to find the net. However, Tom
Callaghan is a doubtful home starter.
Livingston have a 100% record after five games and manager Jim
Leishman says his players are having to adapt to a dual role. They are
underdogs in cup ties but are very much the team that all the other
third division sides would like to beat.
Leishman has added Barbadian David Alleyne to the squad for the home
game against Albion Rovers. Rovers could include one-time Rangers player
Dougie Bell as a trialist.
Alloa include Neil Johnston for the visit of Caley Thistle while Ian
Porteous and John Fowler could start the game for Arbroath at home to
East Stirlingshire.
Queen's Park have to wait for Ross Caven, scorer of the only goal last
week against 'Shire, for the home match against Brechin. The visitors to
Hampden have Dougie Scott suspended and they add Graham Christie.
The division's highest attendance surely will be at Dingwall, where
Cowdenbath visit Ross County.

BREAD and butter -- thae diet which has nourished millions -- is back
on the menu today. It might not be as tasty as the caviare feeling of
Coca-Cola Cup success in midweek, but Airdrie and Dundee have league
business to sort out.
And if their league form came close to what they have been doing in
the cup, their management teams would be extremely happy this early in
the season.
Dundee United will find out if Airdrie have had any reaction when they
meet at Tannadice. The Lanarkshire club's assistant manager, John
McVeigh, reckoned: ''This is a good one to come into after midweek. The
players will still be up for it.'' Paul Jack took a knock in the midweek
win over Partick Thistle, but may be fit in time.
United have a long injury list -- Dave Bowman, David Hannah, Craig
Brewster, Scott Crabbe, Neil Caldwell, and Sandy Robertson -- but
central defender Dave Mitchell, 19 tomorrow, is brought into the squad
by manager Billy Kirkwood, as is another teenager, 18-year-old winger
Paul Walker.
Dundee, meanwhile, are up and running for their visit to Dumbarton.
Dusan Vrto and Ray Farningham are doubtful because of injury, but
manager Jim Duffy will impress on his players that the October 25 cup
meeting with Airdrie is a long way away.
Elsewhere, Morton have no injuries or suspensions for the visit of
leaders Dunfermline, who completed the signing last night of Forfar
front-man David Bingham in a deal worth around the #100,000 mark. At the
same time, striker Gary Higgins was freed, and it is believed that he
could end up at Station Park.
St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock wants his squad to keep up their
recent good work with a victory over a Clydebank side who beat them 3-0
recently in a Challenge Cup match.
''I know some of the supporters could not understand why I praised the
players when we were losing,'' said Sturrock, ''but there was no doubt
that we were playing good football.''
One blow is the loss of defender Kevin McGowne. His ankle ligament
injury will keep him out for around six weeks, and Jim Weir -- just back
after a long lay-off -- has a groin problem.
St Mirren will field their new signing, striker Mark Yardley from
Cowdenbeath. Saints will need Yardley's striking power against Hamilton
at Firhill since they have a long injury list.

FOR males of a certain age, serving intimate dinners to Joan Collins
in her San Tropez hideaway would be to live out a lifetime of fantasies.
But for Scottish freestyle skier Julie Gall, working for the British
actress was a real-life experience which she believes will help her
achieve her own sporting fantasy of being a British medal prospect at
the Winter Olympics.
The 24-year-old Ayrshire woman is UK moguls champion, ranked sixth in
Europe, and has qualified for the World Cup circuit this winter. Olympic
selection for Nagano, in 1998, is a realisable ambition. But with the
British Ski Federation's budget already slashed, wiping out the Nordic
team, Julie must fund almost all her own campaign, or join the ranks of
talented British competitors forced off piste because they are broke.
You form the impression, however, that this is one athlete who will
not fail. In a determined campaign to pay for her #10,000-per-year
training and competition programme, Gall, from Symington, has shown rare
enterprise.
When the normal avenues closed -- 150 letters to blue chip companies
(30 rejections, 120 no-replies), and Miss Collins employed a full-time
chef -- bilingual, cordon-blue cook Julie went into the construction
business.
Cooking for the navvies?
Miss Gall, all 5ft 3in. of her, looks coolly across the table. ''No.
Sawing logs, mixing concrete, and hammering in nails. Building log
houses in Colorado.''
There is more to this young lady than meets the eye. In the gym, where
she works out for three hours at a time, she can bench-press one and a
half times her own bodyweight.
The stereo-type image of the cosseted, privileged apres ski set takes
another jolt. When she trained through the summer, it was on a glacier,
high in the Rockies, sleeping rough.
In a tent?
Another cool look, a giggle: ''No, in a bivvy bag, under the stars. It
was too warm. And besides, it saves money.
''I don't want to be the little girl whose parents got her to the
Olympics. They've already coughed up more than I'd any right to expect.
I want to get there on my own ability and initiative.''
Help from agents?
Another laugh. ''Are you kidding?''
The brutal practicality of the real sporting world quickly cooled
Julie's euphoria after she won the UK title and a UK team place. ''I
went to Mark McCormack's International Management Group in London, to
see what they could do for me,'' she recalls. ''I don't know how I could
have been so naive. They told me to come back when I had some money. 'We
actually help you when you have got money,' they explained.''
Educated at Craigholm school, Glasgow, and having taken a cordon blue
cookery course in England, she managed to get a job at Joan Collins'
South of France retreat.
''I worked there for three months -- hard work, but well paid. It took
care of all my ski-ing expenses last winter.
''She would have anything from three to six guests staying at one
time. I would make breakfast for them, go shopping at the fish and fruit
market, the patisserie -- everything had to be fresh every day -- then
come back and fix lunch. Then I'd go off and spend three hours in the
gym. I'd come back drenched, then go and cook dinner.
''It was all a bit surreal, sitting in Joan Collins' home at night,
trying to visualise mogul runs.''
More recently, Julie has been working as a chef at a grill in Winter
Park, an hour from Boulder, Colorado. ''The US team go there, and
Alberto Tomba stayed the whole of November. There are just two quiet
bars -- no distractions. It has a very competitive atmosphere. The place
is full of cowboys -- it's not like a ski village at all.
''I've come home to try and put a sponsorship package together -- I'm
broke, but not in debt. But it has been really dispiriting. I am far
better-known in Colorado than in my own country. Everybody knows me
there -- and they tell me if I was American, they'd sponsor me. Here,
people don't want to know.
''I even wrote to my MP, Phil Gallie, who took the matter up with the
Scottish Sports Council. The main problem is that the National Lottery
can't be used to help elite competitors prepare.''
The Council replied to Gallie, saying the BSF spent #100,000 annually
on administration. In fact much of that figure is spent on coaching.
Gallie was given the impression of a bureaucratic body, and Jonathon
Baynton, the BSF's freestyle director, went ballistic, with an angry
exchange of letters to the SSC, insisting they had misled the MP into
believing the BSF did not give a damn about the athletes.
Gall, however, is no nearer a solution.
''People ask what I do, and I say I am a skier. 'Are you any good?'
they ask. Well I don't want to come across as an arrogant little bitch.
But what am I supposed to say? Of course I say I'm good. I'm the British
champion. Am I supposed to say I am rubbish, just because Britain isn't
a great skiing nation?
''Then they ask what my real job is. It makes me furious.
''I work hard. During the summer I rose at 5am, cycled seven miles to
the running track, ran for four miles, before working seven hours on the
construction site. Then I would go to the gym, practise on the
trampoline, and do circuits or pliometrics, and home for 10am.''
Other jobs have involved working as a chalet girl in Morzine --
instructing skiing by day, cooking dinner for tourists by night -- ski
guide at Val d'Isere, helicopter guide, instructing off piste in
Colorado, water ski instructer, and modelling ski wear. She is also a
competitive mountain biker and rock climber.
Liz McIntyre, the USA's reigning Olympic moguls silver medallist, is a
great friend. ''She's come across all the barriers I've faced, and
really encourages me. Having spent the last seven years in the USA,
skiing, I've developed a really focussed American attitude. And because
I'm known by the Americans, I get a lot of coaching from them, gratis.
''I always have to cut corners. A friend who works for an airline gets
a number of free flights. He's promised me I can have some of them this
winter, to cut my travel costs.''
The British freestyle team is shortly due to leave for training in
Tignes -- they will drive there, eight people and their equipment packed
in two vehicles. The BSF can only afford to pay for the petrol. Lift
passes and accommodation has to be paid by the skiers.
Bayntun, at BSF' Scottish headquarters, also cuts corners. He has
loaned an innovative Briton portable ski lift to the Swiss, because in
return they will allow some UK skiers to train at their secret base in
the Alps.
The Russians have agreed to take one competitor for a month's coaching
and training at a cost to the BSF of just #1000. ''The deal is that our
admin. here helps them arrange flights and and does some office work,
which they find difficult,'' says Bayntun.
He also does similar reciprocal deals with other nations, but
sometimes the frustration is overwhelming. Like earlier this year, when
teenager Sophie Ormond, one of Britain's more promising Alpine skiers,
quit the UK. She had been offered a place on the French team, who could
pay her expenses -- Ormond has dual nationality.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns is convinced he has a bargain following
yesterday's Scottish League transfer tribunal which ordered the Parkhead
side to pay #380,000 to Falkirk after having signed the out-of-contract
central defender during the close season writes Jim Reynolds.
Celtic originally had offered #200,000 for the 31-year-old, while
Falkirk, who are desperately disappointed with the decision, wanted
#700,000.
Yesterday Burns likened the Hughes situation to the one which
surrounded the signing of left back Tosh McKinlay, who moved from Hearts
for a tribunal fee of #350,000. ''Tosh came under similar circumstances
and has since won a Scotland cap,'' said the Celtic manager.
Said the player: ''I'm glad it's all over, although it didn't affect
my play. I owed so much during my five years at Falkirk to manager Jim
Jefferies and his assistant Billy Brown.''
Ironically, Jefferies and Brown have also moved on from Brockville, to
take over the reins at Hearts and, Celtic visit Tynecastle this
afternoon.
The #380,000 fee for Hughes means that Burns has now spent #6m on
players since he took over as manager at Parkhead. The others were Phil
O'Donnell, Pierre van Hooydonk, McKinlay and Andreas Thom -- and Burns
is determined to add more quality players to his staff.
Other transfers decided by the tribunal yesterday were that Airdrie
should pay #84,000 to Clydebank for Sean Sweeney and that Arbroath pay
Montrose #13,000 for Alan Kennedy.
Meantime, the Parkhead men this afternoon will be bidding to get over
their first defeat of the season, to Rangers last Tuesday night, but
they have three major injury worries. van Hooydonk, Thom and O'Donnell
are all doubtful.
Hearts manager Jim Jefferies could drop veteran goalkeeper Henry Smith
after his mistakes in the Coca-Cola Cup defeat at Dundee and Craig
Nelson stands by. Allan Johnston should also return to the side.
Aberdeen travel to Kilmarnock with Theo Snelders set for a recall. The
keeper missed the cup victory at Motherwell as his wife was having a
baby.
Kilmarnock, without a league point and suffering from a lack of
confidence, will still be without Tom Black, Steve Maskrey and Billy
Findlay, and manager Alex Totten said: ''Our fans have been very loyal
and it is about time we started rewarding them.''
Partick Thistle, beaten in the Coca-Cola Cup in midweek by first
division Airdrie, are operating with a pool of around just 15 players
and it is difficult for manager Murdo MacLeod to contemplate sweeping
changes, or, indeed, any changes apart from maybe pulling on the boots
himself. That may not be such a bad idea.
Today, the Firhill side make the difficult trip to Kirkcaldy to face
Raith Rovers.

MARK Hateley is on his way out of Ibrox, despite the fact that
Rangers' assistant manager Archie Knox yesterday described reports that
the injured striker was about to join Queen's Park Rangers as
''speculation.''
Hateley will travel down to London tomorrow, and subject to the usual
medical, will join the Loftus Road club in a deal estimated at #1.5m.
The big striker also will become assistant manager to his former Ibrox
team-mate, Ray Wilkins.
Knox was in charge at Ibrox as manager Walter Smith travelled to
Germany last night to see Borussia Dortmund, Rangers next Champions'
League opponents, in action against Eintracht Frankfurt in the
Bundesliga, and when asked about the Hateley situation, he said:
''There's always going to be speculation. There is nothing concrete, and
there has been no bid.''
But then it emerged that Hateley's agent was having talks with Queen's
Park Rangers manager Wilkins about personal terms for the man who
finished up as Rangers top scorer last season.
Wilkins has made no secret of the fact that he wanted to unload some
of the #6m the London club received from Newcastle United for Les
Ferdinand to bring Hateley back to England, and the big fellow, who has
played in England, Italy, France and Scotland, now is on the move again.
Meantime, Hateley's other priority is to get himself back to full
fitness following knee and ankle injuries and Knox said: ''He is walking
about fine and it shouldn't be too long before he is back training.''
That now looks certain to be in London.
On the home front, Rangers bid to maintain their 100% domestic record
when they entertain Hibernian at Ibrox this afternoon, but there is a
doubt over left back Davie Robertson, who had to be taken off against
Celtic last Tuesday night with a hamstring injury. The injury is not a
bad one, but with the match against Dortmund coming up next Wednesday,
Rangers may decide to give him an extra few days to get himself fully
fit.
''Not that we can afford to look ahead to Wednesday,'' said Knox. ''We
have Hibernian tomorrow and that should be enough to occupy all our
thoughts for the moment. We will have the same squad as we had for the
Celtic match, plus Ian Ferguson, who is back after a hamstring injury.''
Paul Gascoigne, who started on the bench at Falkirk last week, will
definitely play from the start against Hibernian, and Russian striker
Oleg Salenko will again team up with Ally McCoist.
Falkirk, who have had a dreadful start to the season, wilol be hoping
to pick up their first points whenh they meet Motherwell at Brockville
and manager John Lambie said yesterday: ''Losing our opening three games
isn't good form, but all we can do is keep working hard and hope we get
a long overdue rub-of-the-green.
''We don't want a gap to develop between ourselves and the other
teams. It's going to be a long, hard season and we can't afford to give
our rivals a few points of a start.''
Mo Johnston and David Weir have both passed fitness tests and will
play, but Johnston's strike-partner Colin McDonald will miss the match
after picking up an ankle injury.
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish will be looking for a boost after
Wednesday night's Coca-Cola Cup defeat by Aberdeen. He said: ''There is
a very fine line between success and failure at the moment. Although we
lost 2-1 to Aberdeen, we had the better chances in the match and could
just as easily have won.
''Despite the defeat the boys played well in the match and I'm hoping
they can keep it going at Brockville.''
McLeish will be without midfielder Paul Lambert and there are doubts
about left back Rob McKinnon.

MERGER
US West Inc yesterday launched a legal action to block the proposed
merger of Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting System, just hours after
the agreement was announced.
US West, a regional telephone company based in Colorado, owns a stake
in Time Warner's entertainment division and charged in its suit that
Time's acquisition of Turner would create a conflict of interest.
Time Warner and Turner announced earlier that they had agreed to a
merger, through which the holdings of Turner Broadcasting would become
the Time Warner Video Division. Turner Chairman Ted Turner would become
vice chairman and would control the video division after the merger.
Time Warner and Turner officials could not be reached immediately for
comment on the suit. The merger would create the largest media
conglomerate in the world.
The proposal was announced at the end of last month, a few days after
a radio and engineering company, Westinghouse, announced that it was
buying one of the three major television networks, CBS, and three weeks
after Disney bought the leading network, ABC.
The Disney-ABC conglomerate had combined revenues of $16.4 billion
last year. Time-Warner and TBS, which owns the all-news network, CNN,
will have revenues of about $19.8 billion. By comparison, the revenues
of News Corp, Rupert Murdoch's international corporation, were $9
billion in the last year.

TAKEOVER BID
SCOTTISHPOWER posted its final offer to Manweb shareholders yesterday
as the Chester-based company said it was continuing talks with a
potential foreign rival.
ScottishPower's final offer for Manweb is #61.70 and 11 ScottishPower
shares for every 10 Manweb shares -- a package that is currently worth
1011p -- with an all-cash alternative of 990p.
''It is the only offer on the table for Manweb and represents full
value and certainty,'' said ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson.
He reminded Manweb shareholders that ScottishPower had already bought
a 17.3% stake in Manweb on the open market and had received acceptances
for a further 5.9%.
But Manweb reiterated its rejection of ScottishPower's hostile #1100
bid and added: ''substantive talks are continuing with an overseas third
party that may or may not lead to a recommended cash offer.''
Manweb stunned the City on Tuesday by saying it had begun discussions
with this unidentified ''white knight'', City analysts say it may be
anything from a US power company to a French water group.
But they remain puzzled why any foreign investor should enter a
bidding war with ScottishPower for Manweb when six other UK regional
electricity companies might be bought more cheaply and without a
contest.
The closing date for acceptance of ScottishPower's offer is October 6.
But if a rival bid is tabled before the it goes unconditional -- ie
before ScottishPower gets enough acceptances to give it more than 50% of
Manweb -- the entire bidding process will go back to square one.
ScottishPower shares eased 2p to 358p, while Manweb, which distributes
electricity in Merseyside and North Wales, fell 5p to 1006p.
* Electricity regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild warned yesterday
that there are several obstacles to overcome if the recommended #1950m
takeover of Midlands Electricity by PowerGen is to be approved.
He is inviting comments from all relevant parties so he can give his
views to the Director General of Fair Trading.

REGAL MASTERS SNOOKER:
STEPHEN Hendry kept an enthusiastic home crowd happy last night with a
6-4 victory over Nigel Bond in the quarter-final stage of the Regal
Masters in Motherwell Civic Centre.
However, the fans had to wait until after the interval before the Scot
produced the form which has made him world champion for the past four
years.
It was a rematch of the world championship final earlier this year,
but Bond, who lost 18-9 to his Team Sweater Shop colleague at Sheffield,
clearly stood a much better chance over this shorter distance.
He could even allow himself thoughts of victory when he led 3-2 at the
interval and then 4-3, but Hendry was beginning to cue well and soon he
was virtually unstoppable.
Hendry, who had breaks of 100, 96, 78, and 91 after the interval, said
that he took a little time to adjust to the table and paid tribute to
the way Bond played.
The world No.12 made early progress while the Scot had to be content
with mini-breaks as he found the pockets tight. Breaks of 30 to 60 are
not usually enough to win frames and Hendry produced five of them in the
first four but was only level at 2-2.
Bond produced runs of 30 and 46 to take the fifth frame but when he
made a mistake just after the interval, we saw the first sign of vintage
Hendry.
He compiled a break of 100 to level the match before Bond regained the
lead with a run of 46. A superb long pot was the prelude to Hendry's
clearance of 96 in the eighth frame, and a break of 78 put the Scot in
front and he stayed there.
With Welshman Darren Morgan awaiting the winner, last night's match
completed the semi-final line-up.
Earlier, Irishman Ken Doherty's two-year reign came to an end when he
lost 6-4 to Peter Ebdon. The world No.10 next meets Ronnie O'Sullivan,
who put out snooker's other young lion, John Higgins, by 6-5 on Thursday
night.
Doherty's success story at Motherwell had begun two years ago with a
near miraculous recovery from 4-0 down to beat James Wattana 5-4 in his
first match at the venue, and Ebdon knew that it would be very difficult
to take the title away.
The Dubliner drew first blood but breaks of 57 and 66 put Ebdon ahead.
Doherty levelled up with a break of 106 before the Englishman replied
with a century of his own, a run of 102 to restore his lead at the
interval.
Ebdon went two frames ahead at 4-2 and again 5-3, with the holder
tenaciously hitting back with a break of 55.
It took a brave shot on the final green ball, which the world No.10
cut into a middle pocket before clearing the rest of the colours to the
pink, to book Ebdon's place against O'Sullivan in the first semi-final
this afternoon.

CURRENCY
TURMOIL continued in the currency markets with France and Italy
bearing the brunt of the sell-off although the dollar was also under
pressure prompting speculation about intervention by the Federal
Reserve.
The turbulence follows Wednesday's comments from German finance
minister Theo Waigel pouring cold water on Italy's chances of joining
the initial phase of European monetary union, the single currency. This
reopened fears of another European currency crisis.
Speculation that the Italian lira was soon to rejoin the ERM had
pushed the currency higher in recent months. City dealers are anxiously
watching developments at the EU summit in Majorca for further signs of
polarisation between the German mark bloc and southern Europe.
The mark was in demand in the currency markets and rose against all
the major currencies. It added two pfennigs versus the pound at
DM2.2331. However, against a weak dollar it gained a cent to $1.5798.
Sterling's trade weighted index dropped 0.1 to 84.5.

TRANSPORT
NEGOTIATIONS on the sale of London City airport are said to be well
advanced with a number of European companies interested in buying the
airport which has never taken off properly.
BAA and Virgin have said they are not interested. Construction group
John Mowlem, 90% owner of the airport, signalled two years ago that it
wished to dispose of the airport which is thought to take up a
disproportionate amount of management time not to mention financial
resources.
London City Airport, built in 1986, is carrying losses of #50m. Its
annual passenger numbers are around 540,000.
London City Airport is not the only Mowlem business facing disposal.
Chief executive John Marshall said a decision had been taken ''to cut
the throats'' of those businesses within the group that are
underperforming.
That includes the bulk of the project engineering business in the UK
which is involved in building chemical and petrochemical plants, its
German construction division BauTec, and the bulk of the French
scaffolding business. As many as 700 jobs, equivalent to around 6% of
Mowlem's total workforce, are expected to go following the business
closures.
However, Mr Marshall said that such action was ''necessary for the
health of the group''. A #31.8m exceptional charge in the interim
accounts helped to drag John Mowlem into a loss of #31.8m. A net charge
of #17.8m related to costs associated with the closure or restructuring
of non core loss-making activities.
The continuing operations performed well in the first half with the
SGB scaffolding business making a particularly healthy contribution.
The cash position is expected to stabilise in the second half before
improving next year. John Mowlem shares lost 5p to 64p.

HAMILTON stages its first Sunday meeting with major attractions for
regular punters and first-time racegoers.
Feature race is the Evening Times Handicap, in which Vindaloo will
attempt to set a 20th century record by winning 10 handicaps in a Flat
season.
David Abell's runner, winner of a seller at Edinburgh in April, has
landed another eight handicaps since. He finished second to Knave's Ash
at Pontefract on Thursday, his eighth unsuccessful attempt to break the
record.
Tomorrow he carries top weight and takes on 10 rivals including the
Micheal Stoute-trained My Gina, Ben Hanbury's Bardon Hill Boy, and
Patrick Haslam's Talented Ting.
Southern trainers provide the four runners for what will be a hotly
contested conditions race. Mark Prescott runs Exalted, Bill Jarvis has
Gryada, Stoute saddles Sava River, and Peter Chapple-Hyam is represented
by Latin Reign. All are in with a chance and despite the sparse field
betting will be wide open.
Local trainers Linda Perratt, Tom Dyer, and Robert McKellar are well
represented.
The fun begins at 11.30 and includes a fun fair, variety of bands, and
the opportunity to win an all expenses-paid trip for two to the
Breeders' Cup in New York worth #3000, and for the best dressed woman,
judged by members of the Variety Club, there is a day out to Nice and
Monte Carlo, sponsored by the Evening Times.
Celebrity guests will include Ally McCoist, Paul Gascoigne, Walter
Smith, and Charlie Nicholas, while champion boxer Paul Weir and Frank

A GOOD race is in prospect for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes this
afternoon, the highlight of Ascot's Festival of Racing, which features
Bahri and Ridgewood Pearl.
Both were impressive at the royal meeting in June, but Ridgewood Pearl
looks set to start a strong favourite, having retained her unbeaten
record for the season with a success at Longchamp.
Bahri ran well in defeat behind top-class older horses, Sayyedati and
Halling. Nothing of that calibre appears in this field and Bahri has an
excellent chance of returning to winning form.
Decorated Hero looks a worthy favourite for the Festival Handicap, but
there is each-way value in Nagnagnag. Last seen in this country winning
a moderate race at Epsom in June, she has since run three fine races to
be placed in Listed and Group company in France. She will appreciate the
ground and should run a big race off a handy mark.
Derby form has worked out well, with the first four netting five
subsequent Group races between them, so it would be no surprise to see
Riyadian land the Cumberland Lodge Stakes.
Seventh at Epsom, Paul Cole's charge reappeared to win an easy race at
Doncaster and should be up this stiffer task.
More Royal can overturn Bijou D'inde in the Royal Lodge Stakes. Having
won his first two races he was unlucky when beaten by Alhaarth at
Goodwood. He has since progressed to score at Deauville and can enjoy
his fourth win here.

UNLIKE some prominent folk in other sports who are wary of saying
''good morning'', lest it breaches the constitution, Ian Doyle does not
need much encouragement to offer forthright, often scathing, opinions on
any subject that comes to mind.
The man who has become one of the best-known names in world snooker
without ever cueing a ball in anger is not inclined to climb on to the
soap box and denigrate his own sport these days.
It has been known, to be fair, for Doyle to have a serious public
crack at people within the green-baized world but, for the moment, he
seems quite enamoured with its progress, particularly the current Regal
Masters at Motherwell, which is his own promotion and one of Scotland's
major sporting events.
''We have managed to build it up to that status and the TV coverage is
now being distributed to 67 countries in all sorts of languages,'' he
said.
''I imagine it is watched in some very odd places. I am quite sure
that somewhere in a jungle hut in the Amazon somebody will be watching
the Regal Masters.''
He can see the tournament stretching well into the new millenium but
what pleases him most is the development of Scottish talent from the
early days.
Stephen Hendry, of course, was, and will remain, his most spectacular
protege but he can now point to John Higgins and Alan McManus as among
the world's best.
The progress of home players has been such that Doyle believes it is
certain that Scotland will start favourites for the new World Cup event,
the details of which will be announced in November.
''The last time there was a World Cup was 1990 when we only had 160
professionals in the game. Today, four years later, we have almost 900
worldwide. There will be something like 50 countries competing.''
He bristles at suggestions that TV exposure of snooker has peaked and
may be on the downslope, citing what he describes as greater and bigger
expansions of the game, especially in Europe and Asia.
''The European Open in February is being sponsored by the Maltese
Government; the German Open will be the first world ranking event in
that country; Thailand have two world ranking events this year and, in
fact, the game has never been in a healthier state.''
Scarcely taking time to inhale, Doyle throws some remarkable
statistics about the way snooker has changed. According to him, and he
should know, the average age of winners has dropped from 35 to 22 in the
past 10 years; the average time of a frame of snooker has dropped from
23 minutes to under 11; the average age of the top 16 has gone down by
14 years.
''We have three young players here who have joined the professional
ranks at 16.''
The last time we spoke at length, Doyle was seriously considering
investing in the football world but that enthusiasm has cooled
considerably.
Let him explain why: ''I don't believe Scottish football fans
appreciate what people do for them.
''I would highlight two classic examples, Fergus McCann and Jim
Oliver.
''McCann, whom I have never met, has pulled together a number of
investors in Celtic, taken a club which was dead and buried 18 months
ago, given it a proper business structure, a business plan, and is it
moving forward.
''If I was a Celtic fan I would do everything in my power to ensure
that Fergus McCann was going to be around Celtic Football Club for a
long time to come.''
He then deftly switched wings and headed for Firhill where he is often
a guest of a friend and confesses to being amazed at what the chairman,
Jim Oliver, has achieved in the time he has been there.
''Again, you can see there is a business structure in place, they have
a new playing surface, a new stand. That has had to be a priority in the
game.
Scottish football has been guilty of forgetting about the fans,
leaving them to stand in the rain and cold.
Rangers, through David Murray, have led the way, McCann, in my view,
will make Celtic a real force in Scottish football and I think it is
time the tabloids stood back and recognised these things.''
In full flow now, Doyle was off on the trail of another of his pet
dislikes, the current tabloid journalism.
''The problem with the tabloids, I am afraid, is that they are
bringing in whippersnappers who haven't even had their noses cleaned yet
and don't know the job.''
The criticism of McCann and Oliver has put him off his earlier
intention to join in the football business.
Instead, he remains a Rangers supporter who gets to see Partick
Thistle.
''I think the treatment of these two in particular has been outrageous
and the writers who are responsible should be ashamed of themselves.''
Doyle has moved out of his immediate arena, none the less, into golf
where he has one exciting young Scot, Dean Robertson, for whom he
predicts a bright future.
''He has a great sense of purpose and has done really well this year.
We want to ensure that he can enjoy his game in the next couple of
years. We have completed stage one in that he has earned his European
Tour ticket. He is fifty-third in the order of merit and during the
winter he will be going through a fitness programme to build up his
stamina. We are aiming for Valderrama and the Ryder Cup of 1997.''
Never one to sell his men short, Doyle believes that Robertson can win
a major one day.
''I took him on because he is such a real professional that he
reminded me of Stephen Hendry.''
That lofty ambition on behalf of his golfer goes in tandem with
another big desire, which seems much more attainable for the moment,
that Hendry will pass Steve Davis' six world titles . . .
''He has five now but I think he will win eight''.
If he had been toying with the idea of joining in the brave new rugby
world, he has stepped back from that as well.
''I think rugby has a few hurdles to get over. They can fill
Murrayfield but club rugby gets nobody through the gates and I don't see
how clubs can fund the professional game. No, for me it is snooker and
golf; that will do.''
Hendry will be universally recognised as the greatest player of all
time, and Higgins is the best bet to be his successor as world No.1.
That is what the man said. You would argue?
Doyle, who does not need to worry about the bailiffs being outside,
could retire tomorrow and enjoy his leisure but it is not what this
energetic loquacious man seeks.
''I am enjoying every minute of my life and I want to continue that
way. I am very fortunate to be working with real professionals.
''If you think about it, I have daily contact with people who have the
same blinkered attitude to their sport as Nicklaus and Palmer had to
golf. Working with them is a fantastic experience.''
Presumably, someone with such clear and strong opinions might not
always be easy to work for, but his chosen few seem to be doing all
right for themselves.
For a man whose son claims that dad couldn't hit a barn door with a
snooker ball, Doyle is doing not too badly in his chosen sport, either.

* WILCUMA galloped into Cambridgeshire reckoning after having produced
a decisive late thrust to win at Haydock Park yesterday. His defeat of
Calder King in the Dream Mile had bookmakers revising their lists for
the big Newmarket handicap a week today.
Wilcuma is set to carry 7st 9lb -- he is unpenalised for yesterday's
victory -- and one bookmaker has slashed his price to 25-1 (from 40s).

THOSE who long to bask under the French sun, enjoying the best cuisine
that country has to offer, now have a second chance to escape to a
restaurant which prides itself on offering a taste of the left bank.
The Cul De Sac, which has been delighting diners in the West End of
Glasgow for many years, has now opened a second premises, at 1179
Pollokshaws Road, Shawlands -- in the heart of Glasgow's bustling South
Side.
Like its West End counterpart, the Cul de Sac South Side has a
wonderfully cosmopolitan atmosphere, with relaxing surroundings and a
menu which offers a wide choice of food. It is a French creperie
restaurant and cafe bar, a place where southsiders will be able to meet
for coffee, enjoy a long lunch or test the wine list over the formality
of a full dinner -- the Shawlands Cul de Sac will be open for food all
day, seven days a week.
The quality of the food is obvious at first tasting but what will
surprise most newcomers to the Cul de Sac experience is the value for
money. Committed Francophiles will no doubt head straight for the
crepes, to see how they compare to those they tasted in a little cafe in
Brittany -- they won't be disappointed. Not only do they have the
genuine mouth-watering aroma, the Cul de Sac chefs have prepared a
choice of adventurous fillings, some, like mushroom and tarragon will be
particularly attractive for vegetarians.
The restaurant doesn't however desert it's Scottish roots -- for an
auld alliance special, choose a piece of fine Scottish steak from the
grill menu, which also includes beautifully-prepared burgers for those
who enjoy simpler food.
Lunch is an important part of the French day and again this specific
menu caters for everyone from those on an important ''working lunch'' to
those who need a light snack in the middle of a day's shopping. Choose
from pasta, quiche, plaice goujons, croque monsieurs and of course, soup
of the day. Ideal for a nutritious lunch, with nothing apart from the
pasta dishes costing over five pounds. Late lunchers can take advantage
of an offer which takes one-third of the price of crepes and burgers
between 12 and 7pm.
The a la carte menu is typically adventurous, offering a high standard
of cuisine, again at a reasonable price.
Southsiders can also experience the very European concept of brunch.
Relax with a selection of the Sunday supplements as you take the full
breakfast, also available in a vegetarian version, between 12 and 4pm.

LONG gone are the days when a cooker looked exactly like a cooker. The
kitchen is no longer viewed as a purely functional room, with appliance
designers considering the aesthetic appeal of the many appliances that
run our lives.
Don't be surprised if you walk into a friend or relative's new kitchen
and find it difficult to spot any appliances. Refrigerators and
dishwashers are increasingly finding their place is hidden behind unit
doors. Even the cooker can be difficult to see at first, defined by the
clean lines of the hob, hood and oven front which can belnd beautifully
with your choice of units.
Whether you're giving the kitchen a whole new look or simply replacing
worn-out applances, The Cooker Factory can help. After deciding on a new
cooker, the temptation might be there to update other appliances. Make
sure you look for the ultimate American fridge freezer from Hotpoint,
with its automatic ice maker and dispenser, normal selling price
#1999.99 but available at The Cooker Factory for #1399.
If economy rather than extravagance is the order of the day, look out
for this week's special offers: Candy fridge freezers with a 4.7 cu ft
fridge and 4.1 cu ft freezer are reduced from #329.99 to #239; Zanussi
slot-in electric fan-assisted cookers, normal selling price #549 are on
offer at #349; Zanussi tumble driers, normally priced at #399 are a snip
at #249; and Candy fully integrated dish washers have been reduced from
#699.99 to an incredible #399.

Fiona Harrison visits a West End business which is really cooking
SITUATED opposite St George's Cross subway station and beside the
refurbished statue of St George himself, The Cooker Factory is proud to
be associated with its illustrious neighbour.
''We have a lot in common,'' says Hugh Alsop, owner and managing
director of the company. ''For a start our prices will slay you, and
although I haven't gone quite as far as St George and renounced all my
worldly possessions, at our give-away prices I'm well on my way there.''
Hugh is a man who likes to drive a hard bargain. The good news for his
customers is that they are the ones who benefit.
This independent Glasgow company has been going from strength to
strength since Hugh first started it nearly thirteen years ago. Situated
in its current imposing premises at St George's Cross for the past seven
years, it offers an impressive range of cookers and domestic appliances
at even more impressive prices.
The Cooker Factory has an astute buying policy, which allows savings
to be passed directly to the customer.
''I like to think that it's a bit like a mini version of the Stock
Exchange in here,'' explains Hugh. ''I'm in constant contact with all of
the major suppliers, looking for the best deal at the moment. We're able
to buy immediately and have the stock in the showroom at fantastically
reduced prices.''
This policy of searching for the best one-off deals throughout Britain
and Europe ensures that there is a constantly changing supply of top
quality goods at bargain prices. Add this to a full range of built-in
and integrated appliances at the best possible prices, from the leading
brand names in domestic appliances, and you'll see why Hugh Alsop and
his staff take pride in the choice and value they offer.
The 4000 sq ft showroom is currently stocked with around #0.5m worth
of equipment. If you thought a cooker was just a cooker prepare to be
pleasantly surprised.
The choice in The Cooker Factory is extremely wide -- choose from
integrated or free standing, single or double oven, modern or country
style.
Why not opt for the romance of an 'Aga' style dual fuel double oven
Belling Farmhouse in a choice of red, green or blue? Or a Cannon Classic
Cordon Bleu, a real workhorse of a cooker with eye level grill, griddle
and see-through doors, ideal for a large family, or someone who takes
their cooking seriously.
For the discerning customer looking for something different there is a
range of sophisticated stainless steel cookers from Zanussi, Stoves and
Beaumatic.
You'll also find one of the largest selections of hobs in Scotland,
including a difficult-to-find six-burner hob. Hobs can include
barbecues, deep fat fryers and griddles if required. The current wide
range starts at #149 and includes a halogen stainless steel ceramic hob
from Beaumatic, normally retailing at #699.99, currently priced at #369.
Cooker hoods range from a standard model at #29, to a top-of-the-range
1000 cm chimney hood at #500, with everything you could possible want,
canopy integrated, etc, in between.
The trained and helpful staff can advise you on the cooker most suited
to your requirements. If you want to change your existing model for one
of their built-under appliances with separate grill or oven from New
World, Stoves and Creda, their assistance and knowledge will be
invaluable.
The Cooker Factory can also arrange to have appliances fitted by
Corgi-registered tradesmen. Delivery can be arranged within a day or two
at a time to suit. All products carry a full manufacturer's guarantee.

WEST Lothian District Council's ''lowland crofting'' policy reached a
milestone yesterday when Scottish Office Environment Minister, the Earl
of Lindsay performed the official opening of the first development
carried out under that banner.
A private company -- New Lives New Landscapes -- has brought the
scheme to fruition after purchasing the 200-acre West Harwood farm and
splitting it into 13 holdings ranging from two acres to 25 acres.
Agriculture work on the site -- where the first of the houses is
nearing completion -- is not obligatory but more than half of the
occupants intend to operate some sort of business. These include a
livery, a breeder of Persian cats, and a game-bird hatchery.
The original farmhouse and steading have been adapted as a hi-tech
carpenter's workshop, specialising in custom-made business furniture.
Lord Lindsay said the lowland crofting concept fitted well with the
Government's hopes about how some rural areas might adapt and prosper in
the face of changing circumstances.

MY wife was as forthright as I've come to expect. After one glance:
''You can see your scalp shining through when you get your hair cut now,
Baldy,'' she said. I'm more than used to this type of disarming honesty,
or ''cutting rudeness'' as it should be known; so used to it that I was
able to look unconcerned for almost 10 seconds before rushing up to the
mirror to check the scalp follicle density from all angles.
Later on, as I thought about it, I couldn't help but feel that I was
doomed to be Bobby Charlton by the week's end, and wondering which
approach to take to this development. It was difficult to come to terms
with the fact that my hair was falling out faster than newly wed film
stars.
Men deal with hair loss in different ways: those who choose the toupee
form of denial should be commended for their entertainment value
(perhaps a new Jeremy Beadle show, featuring videos of the funniest
examples). Those, however, who grow their remaining locks into strands
and lay them carefully in circular form on the bald patch are more to be
scorned than pitied.
The school to which I will subscribe go about it by getting their hair
cut extra short in a, ''So what if I am bald? Do you want to make
something of it?'' kind of way. A sign of continuing unhappiness is when
they keep trying to tell the rest of us that their baldness is a sign of
manliness, and that their hair's gone because their testosterone level
is too high. They think baldness is nature's way of saying, ''Hey,
girls, I'm macho. Come and get me''. Bull. In our society at least,
baldness is nature's way of saying, ''Don't bother getting involved with
me. I've to pick the kids up from school in my Volvo Estate in an
hour''.
Everyone knows that God's sign of high testosterone is not being able
to work a washing machine.
Life is so unfair. Why should my hair be deserting me after all I've
done for it? What about all the money I've spent on it? My early
haircare memories consist of Men's Shops, where boys sit on boards and
fat 50-year-olds would wield nothing but scissors and a mental picture
of a large upturned pudding bowl.
These barbers never chat to mere boys, probably because their
knowledge of horse racing, football, boxing, or ''that bird in the fruit
shop'' aren't adequate for his highbrow needs. As I got older, I chose
my own barbers. The first thing you learn is never to entrust your
barnett to anyone with artistic pretensions. Like fashion designers,
hairdressers think avant garde means ''to make someone look ridiculous
by welding their hair into a model of the Tower of London''. Luckily for
me, a friend of mine opened his own place in Glasgow about 10 years ago,
and I've gone there ever since.
The main reason I go to Tommy's, though, is that I know I'll not have
to suffer any terrible banter. Apparently these guys go to college for
three years to qualify as hairdressers. From my experience, I can only
surmise that the first 10 minutes at college is spent learning how to
work a pair of clippers and ''tidy up the top'', while the other two
years 11 months and 29[1/2] days is spent learning to spend all day
asking questions.
For the experienced practitioner, the answers will not at any point
affect the conversation flow, as each question merges with the next to
become a stream of nonsense, ''Hud any holidays yet? (clip clip) this
your lunch break then? (snip) see that Kate Bush, I'd do her in a
minute, fat chance right enough . . .'' Thankfully since I've found
Tommy's shop, I've avoided that.
I'm also comforted by the fact that when he holds the mirror up to the
back of my head, we both know that this is a courtesy rather than an
opportunity to take issue with his work. I'm proud to say that I don't
care what the back of my head looks like: what the eye doesn't see etc.
Last week I went to see Tommy for my usual ''cut, blow dry, parting on
the left, no gel thanks'', and was surprised to see that he's changing
the name of the shop to Bentley's. My worries about the future nature of
my visits were settled as he assured me that there were no great moves
to change the way the shop worked.
No-one's going to be called Justin, and there'll be no lukewarm coffee
around. It'll still be: haircut, bit of chat, and calling you a
gentleman even if the tip's only 10 pence.
I'll have to be careful about the bald stuff, because Ronnie, the guy
that vets this columm, is a bit thin on top. If he sees the next bit,
he'll just cut me off in mid sen . . .

In the last two decades of the twentieth century, Scottish Unionism
has failed to address those features of Scottish society which make it
quite distinct from that of England, explains David S Forsyth
TO present a balanced and more meaningful picture of the Scottish
past, and thus a clearer understanding of present important developments
in the life of our nation, there is an evident need to address the whole
question of Unionism in Scotland. More particularly is this necessary as
the number of dedicated Unionists in contemporary Scotland has numbered
in recent years around a quarter of the electorate, a figure it would be
imprudent to ignore.
And that total does not include those Scots who, while not voting for
the most resolutely Unionist of Scotland's main political parties,
perhaps harbour Unionist sympathies in some hidden recess of their
hearts.
And at the outset of this essay it is essential to point out that the
story of Scottish Unionism was not necessarily synonymous with that of
the Conservative Party in Scotland. It has been an ideological and
social dynamic of a more complex nature than can be explained away by
mere party politics.
In the present hostile political climate the Union has been portrayed
as something of a poisoned chalice to the Scottish people. It has been
much maligned as the cause of many of contemporary Scotland's economic
and social ills.
In the quite recent past this was not the case. To have a more
meaningful understanding of our history we should consider how Scots
have previously viewed their position to the Union. In the era of
empire, when Scottish influence in the world was at its apex, the Union
was seen as integral to Scotland's prosperity and wellbeing, if not an
expression of the national destiny, through this imperial nexus. Yet
there is nothing new in complaints about the actual working of the
Union.
Unionist Scots in the nineteenth century did not slavishly accept the
Union. Rather they possessed a very clear and determined vision as to
the meaning of the Union and how this affected their relationship with
their larger neighbour to the south.
Even in the year that one would have expected centenary celebration
for the Union, we find that Scots were complaining of infractions of the
articles of the Union by the Westminster Parliament. In particular this
was a defence of the Scots legal system, which was held as being ''most
sacred and fundamental'' to the Scottish nation, but must be seen in
tandem with the belief that ''the growing happiness and prosperity of
Scotland'' had been engendered by the Union of the parliaments. But
within the union state there were certain conditions which were pivotal
to Scotland's position, and one was the ''integrity and preservation of
her own laws''.
If this Scottish Unionist sentiment was encroached upon, then Scots
were more than ready to stand up for their trampled national rights. Yet
this Union was not perceived as being harmful to Scotland, it was seen
as an opportunity for Scots to grasp, a conduit to a larger world stage.
Admittedly, this world stage was the British empire, but it did afford
many opportunities to Scots to make their mark on the world. One journal
of the turn of century saw Scottish influence in British commercial and
manufacturing enterprises comparable to that of the deus ex machina.
Scots were an equal and intrinsic partner in the union state.
The relationship between the two nations was rather quaintly described
as that of two sisters, quite different from most Scots' perception of
England as the rather overbearing, strident, and hectoring schoolmarm of
the Thatcher era. For many Scots the Union was nothing less than ''the
most solemn compact into which England as a separate nation had ever
entered''.
This was a constitutional compact between the two formerly independent
kingdoms; this contract was designed to guard the honour and
self-respect of each of the united nations. While Scots would be
unwilling to consent to any political union which subsumed their name
and nationality in that of England, a united name -- that of Britain --
ensured that neither of the two countries was ever to be thrust upon the
other.
Yet essentially the relationship with England, and indeed the English,
is central to some of the problems surrounding the perception of the
Union in Scotland at present. The southerly neighbour, too, must waken
up to a more veracious understanding of its own history.
The whole issue of Scotland and the Union is not purely a concern of
Scottish history. For the truth is that Scotland has made a significant
contribution to the political development of Britain. Scottish Unionism
was not on the periphery, nor can it be relegated to the Celtic fringe.
G K Chesterton noted this paradox when he observed that many of the
men who influenced English policy came from Scotland. The names of
Scottish Prime Ministers could be read out like a panegyric to Scottish
political ambition. Even Gladstone used Scotland in his Midlothian
campaigns, which so passionately denigrated the Tories of the time.
Still there is much to be done in convincing the English of this
fuller picture of their history, and to convince them of the crucial
role of the various constituents of the British archipelago in the
creation of a British history.
It may take some effort to accomplish this; a cursory glance around
the shelves of the historical library at the University of London
reveals the intriguing sight of books on Scottish history shelved in the
section devoted to English local history! Surely that is a suitable
physical metaphor for this whole conundrum.
The Union was not a threat to Scottish identity and Scottish energies.
On the contrary it afforded Scots the opportunity to extend their
natural enterprise and ability to the world at large. The Primrose
League was typical, but not exclusively redolent of popular imperialism
and Unionism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. But even
this organisation, probably the largest mass movement in British
political history, although closely tied to the Conservative Party, was
a vehicle for various Scottish political and cultural forces whcih
sought their outlet in a number of different expressions which embodied
Scottish Unionism during this period.
Scotland's political history, even in the west, has many traditions
which are not just neatly summed up in the phrase ''Red Clydeside''.
This form of popular Unionism has always proved the most problematic
manifestation of this political phenomenon -- usually parodied, or
pilloried, as the bigoted ravings of the mere lumpenproletariat.
Yet they, too, were aware of the importance of Scottish national
sentiment. In discussions on a suitable badge for the league, the
governing body decided that it would be inappropriate to use the
thistle, not because they were any less Scottish than their rivals, but
because the thistle was defined as a national symbol, and as such could
not be the property of any one political faction.
In the past Unionism was not the sole ideological preserve of a
political party, but was more an understanding of Scotland's place and
role in the world at that time. What is more clear is that Unionism was
able to retain a very distinct and separate Scottish identity. Unlike
the Unionists of today, who are perceived as being synonymous with the
Conservative Party in Scotland and aliens in their own land -- relegated
to a rump, and the status, in many parts of Scotland, of a third party.
That aside, it is more prudent to address why this erstwhile dynamic
and prevailing political force has now become so effete, both in
practical terms and in the eyes of most Scots. Perhaps the answer lies
in the way in which the Conservative Party has palpably failed to
maintain any semblance of this distinct Scottish identity, which I would
argue was an integral feature of Unionist successes both at the polls,
and indeed in a wider popular consciousness of previous years.
One needs to look back only to the 1950s to discover the zenith of
Unionist electoral domination of the Scottish political scene. It was
also the case that in the 1960s the Conservative Party felt confident
about supporting devolution for Scotland. A far cry from the
Jeremiah-like warnings of the present party leaders, who see any
tinkering with the Union as the beginning of the end of their United
Kingdom.
Perhaps they, too, should be taught a history lesson and look to the
home rulers of the past century. They never decried the Union as a
constitutional entity; their concern was centred on the way it stifled
Scottish institutions, and they were also determined imperialists. Again
the Union was seen as an opportunity for Scotland.
In the last two decades of the twentieth century, Scottish Unionism
has failed to address those features of Scottish society which make it
quite distinct from that of England. Lady Thatcher's ''sermon on the
Mound'' attempted to instil into Scots a sense of their past. What it
did not take into account was the seeming paradox in Thatcherism, as far
as it affected Scots, and particularly those members of the Scottish
middle class who should have been obvious torchbearers of the Finchley
gospel.
The determined assault on the founding principles of the welfare state
was also an attack on the very institutions that had wedded Scots to an
understanding of Britishness. Scots have been pilloried as ''subsidy
junkies'', and moaning minnies. In a perverse way this chips away at
Scots' traditional view of themselves as independent, enterprising, and
individualistic. The Conservatives both within Scotland and furth of the
country are preaching what is essentially a conflicting and confusing
message.
The Scottish middle class numbers more than the 25% of the population
who vote Tory. This, coupled with the ''little England'' tenor which has
become so inherent to much of Conservative politics at Westminster has
alienated this segment of the population. The determinedly Scottish
bourgeoisie has been quite justified in feeling aggrieved at their
party's seeming inability, or unwillingness, to countenance a clear
Scottish identity.
Herein must lie a partial explanation why they have deserted the
Tories in their droves. It would be only by recapturing this ground that
Unionism, in its Conservative guise, could ever conceive the hope of
becoming a vital force in Scotland once again.
At the heart of this failure to address the decline of Unionism in
Scotland has been a fundamental shift in Conservative understanding of
the nature of a union state. Once again politicians have been remiss in
ignoring the lessons of history.
The struggle for devolution in the nineteenth century centred on the
creation of a separate Secretaryship for Scotland. Even the leading
Conservatives of the day were sensitive enough to recognise that ''this
matter was dear to the hearts of the Scottish people''.
Certainly they vaunted their adhesion to the belief in ''the great
blessings which had accrued to Scotland and England from the Union'',
but the caveat to all this was that Westminster ''must govern Scotland
in acknowledgment of its distinctive characteristics''.
Even the most ardent anti-home rulers at the time of the agitation for
the Secretaryship perceived that the grievances of Scots ''had a
substantial reality''. This is not the case today as the union state has
been transmuted into a unitary state, which was not the intention of the
framers of the Union.
And this is more than a subtle change in semantics, for it completely
alters the comprehension and working of the Union. It also explains the
centralising tendencies of recent Conservative Governments. Either the
Conservatives have failed to understand their history, or they cannot be
bothered to run the Union in a proper fashion.
Scottish Unionists have not been fifth columnists; they have played a
long and varied part in Scotland's history. Noting the drift towards
centralisation in the early 1880s, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh opined
that most Scots believed this to be a mistake. The feeling of a meeting
that he addressed was that they were considering a great national
question for Scotland (this being the view of Arthur Balfour, a future
British Prime Minister).
Two great issues emanated from this particular meeting to demand a
Scottish Secretary: the need to perpetuate national sentiment, and the
need to satisfy national grievances. Perhaps the Unionists of 1995
should consider these patterns of the past, if they still wish to play a
part in Scotland's future.
* David S Forsyth is a member of the Department of History at
Strathclyde University. Aged 31, he was formerly a public librarian in
Kirkintilloch.  He is convener of a conference on Scottish Unionism
being held at the McCance Building, Strathclyde University next Wednesay
at 10am.   The conference has been organised by Strathclyde's Research
Centre in Scottish History, which was set up in 1993 to reassess
Scottish historical study in the run-up to the millennium, under its
director, Professor Tom Devine. The conference proceedings, some of
which are expected to be controversial, will be published in a book by
John Donald Publishing next year.

THE commissioning of a $60m seed potato development project in Russia,
backed by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, could
have serious long term consequences for UK producers warns a top
Scottish grower-merchant.
''The fact that European money is being used to improve potato
production in Russia is fine, but only if EU leaders also put more
energy and effort in to the development of a European potato regime,''
said Ron McArthur, director of James Haggart and Sons, Muthill, Crieff,
who grow 480 acres of potatoes throughout Angus and West Perthshire.
''At present Russian farmers are producing 33 million tonnes of
potatoes a year at average yields of no better than 10 tonnes a hectare.
If EU investment enables them to grow 20 tonnes a hectare, as it surely
will, we could have an awful lot of surplus produce slopping around
Europe in 10 years.''
Mr McArthur was responding to an announcement, made during a recent
international potato event in Holland, that 8000 hectares of Russian
farmland is to be planted with high quality micro-propogated seed with
the planting area being spread over 30 elite farms. To ensure that the
new seed meets the desired quality standards, six regional stations are
to be established to supervise quality control and seed certification.
The traditional failing of such projects in Russia, namely the lack of
hard currency, has been overcome this time by the securing of a
''privilege credit line'' from the EBRD. Bank support has been
guaranteed for the next eight years, time enough to enable those
involved to lift Russian potato production to Western European
standards.
''The message for the EU surely is that we must have a European Potato
Regime which properly secures and protects our home market and we must
have it now, not in 10 years time when the international marketplace for
potatoes will look very different to what we have today,'' said Mr
McArthur.
The fact that the $60m project was unveiled by Mr L A Sheglov, Russian
agricultural attache in the Netherlands, and was followed by a strong
statement of gratitude concerning the success in Russia of a number of
Dutch companies, was noted by British observers in Holland as a clear
indication that the Dutch will utilise a large slice of the eight year
budget.
''I would think the Dutch have their eyes set on 'utilising' $59.9m,
at least,'' commented Mr McArthur.
The best options for British involvement are thought to lie in the
provision of laboratory skills and Scottish style seed certification
methods. Both SAC and the Scottish Seed Potato Development Council have
already been briefed on the project by officials of the EBRD in London.

SOCIALISM is shrouded in myths. My personal favourite is the one about
John Smith. His death was sad and untimely, that of a man cut down in
his prime. A family was robbed of a fine, principled father, the Labour
Party lost a leader who was both stable and self-assured.
But that, frankly, is as far as it goes. John Smith, it will be
remembered, was responsible for losing the 1992 election. His ''budget''
and his tax plans were mauled by the Tories -- biggest hostage to
fortune since Terry Waite made his ill-advised journey to the Middle
East.
On several occasions I tried to interview him, on the record, about
Monklands. For a man seeking to run the nation, I considered it proper
that he should comment on the rumours and allegations surrounding this
Labour-controlled council, especially as it was on his constituency
doorstep.
Each time he refused. Now that was certainly politically expedient but
falls well short of justifying the eulogies -- which were extolled
during what was the Scottish equivalent of a state funeral -- that he
was the ''best Prime Minister we never had''.
What he did do was fight for one man, one vote in the party and while
this might be important within the Byzantine structure of Labour
politics, it did not rank as an achievement elevating him on the frieze
beside great socialist figures of the past.
This was all brought to mind by the publication of a new book on Tony
Blair, which claims that John Smith, too, had wanted to ditch Clause 4
-- but had never quite got round to it. (Now there is a surprise.) No
doubt when future Prime Minister Blair decides that the single European
currency is a con, and he cannot justify the soaring unemployment which
would inevitably follow from joining, we will be told that John Smith
thought of this, too.
But then revisionism is what socialism is all about. It would make a
great soap opera with Peter Mandelson in the role of JR, and the
good-looking but vacuous Bobby Ewing played by Tony Blair. There would
always be lots of plot because it would be constantly changing -- what
is said at one election would be ditched or rewritten by the next,
whether it is on nuclear arms, unemployment, or nationalisation.
The only problem is that there are some myths which are difficult to
control. The National Health Service in particular. This has been
celebrated as a massive Labour achievement, and its virtues have become
so deeply ingrained in the public psyche because of attendant hype that
is not so easy to rewrite.
According to the Labour Party, healthcare was non-existent before
1948, greedy, grasping doctors stalked the land, and the population was
ridden by rickets, so much so that the Ministry of Health might have
appropriately been called the Ministry of Silly Walks.
In truth, long before Lloyd George's people's Budget in 1909,
three-quarters of all working men belonged voluntarily to friendly
societies. Through subscriptions these bodies employed GPs and paid for
drugs. Healthcare, for the period, was considered good. Those not
members were given free healthcare in voluntary hospitals and many great
institutions were sustained by public donations. Even children's
hospitals, like the Sick Kids in Edinburgh, which celebrates 135 years
next month.
What Nye Bevan, as Attlee's Health Minister, did was to make rash
promises based on a false premise and introduced a service modelled on
Stalin's Russia. Now Uncle Joe had long been a socialist folk hero and
if he could run the hospitals in his promised land without private
funding, so could the pugnacious Nye. He nationalised health and drove
out private finance.
Researching a book on the Sick Kids, what I found striking was how in
the years after the war leading up to the establishment of the NHS,
public donations dried up almost completely. Huge sums had been given
willingly for years making the Sick Kids a world pioneer in its field.
Now it was dependent on the caprice of bureaucrats. ''If we are paying
for it with our taxes, why should we contribute more?'' was a common
remark then and still is. For 40 years the NHS promised funds to build a
new hospital, but never did. In the end the doctors, staff, and parents
had to raise the money themselves to build a new wing. The
internationally famous urological department was housed in a hut on the
hospital grounds and even after this was brought to the NHS's attention
there was a 25-year wait for suitable premises.
This then is at the heart of the problems in the health service. The
Secretary of State Michael Forsyth can say until he is blue in the face
that spending on Scottish health is 25% per head more than in England,
but still the average Scot does not think it is enough.
And if he tries to bring in some market discipline and private cash he
is branded a privatiser, selling off the health service to capitalist
Tory chums.
There is never going to be enough public cash for the health service.
As a result hospitals are under-funded, doctors and nurses are
miserable, and waiting lists bug us all. This is not to decry the NHS.
It has been a success story. We spend 7.1% of GDP on health. On the face
of it this trails the rest of Europe. But when Labour's Sam Galbraith
moans on about this being the lowest in Europe, he is being
disingenuous. On a pound-for-pound queue no country has a better
service.
The reasons why waiting lists are virtually unknown in most
Scandinavian countries and places like Germany is that they do spend
more of GDP on health. But a significant proportion is private financed.
More than 80% of health in Britain is paid for by taxes. In Germany at
least 23% in private, in France 25%, and the Netherlands about 30%.
America spends a whopping 14% of GDP on health -- but 60% of the cash
is private.
There is no need for junior doctors to be working sweatshop hours, for
nurses to be threatening strikes for a living wage, or for lengthy
waiting lists. But there is a price to pay for it which this week's
Healthcare 2000 Report makes clear.
We are all victims of socialist medicine. And while the Labour party
has been able to fool all of the people for some time that it can all be
delivered ''free'' it is a myth which is about to explode.
No doubt John Smith thought so too.

Children's Hour is not what it used to be, explains Allan Laing as he
looks forward to the return this week of some of the best programmes in
television's junior league.
FIRST a confession. I am an avid fan of Live and Kicking. My singular
interest in this Saturday morning children's programme can be summed up
in two words. The first is Emma; the second is Forbes. Put them both
together and you have the woman of this sad man's dreams (well, one of
them). And I suspect that I am not alone because she is drop-dead
gorgeous. Takes after her mum.
This sorry state of affairs is about to become something of a problem
in the matrimonial home. In the past a chap could kid-on he wasn't
watching the show (while keeping a discreet eye on the screen for the
frequent appearances of the delightful Ms Forbes). But now, with a new
series starting today, I have to face the fact that my teenage daughters
have outgrown its appeal. Therefore, there is no longer a built-in
excuse to have the television switched on during Live and Kicking.
Still, all is not lost. The lady, it was disclosed earlier this week,
has been signed up to star in a new Head and Shoulders shampoo
commercial. Strange but all of a sudden I appear to be suffering from
dandruff.
Once upon a time, long before Emma was born, a wee boy's television
life was all so very simple. There was this thing called Children's
Hour, you see. As I recall, it involved Blue Peter, a number of
black-and-white American serials like Circus Boy, The Lone Ranger, The
Cisco Kid, and Whirlybirds, and (on Fridays) a variety show called
Crackerjack. And not much more, really. It all made for cheap and
cheerful television -- and it shut us weans up for, well, for 60 minutes
every tea time.
Today Children's Hour effectively starts when the school bell rings at
3.30pm and (if you include Neighbours and Home And Away) it ends at 6pm.
Which makes it Children's Two-and-a-half Hour. But, like its literary
counterpart, children's television is not taken seriously. At least,
it's not taken seriously enough.
This is a shame because, though far too much of it amounts to little
more than vacuous and violent American cartoon shows, there are some
cracking programmes for kids. In drama terms, for instance, the BBC's
Grange Hill and Byker Grove and ITV's The Ward (it used to be called
Children's Ward) are outstanding and possess the rare quality of
excellence.
This week marks the return of some of the best programmes in
television's junior league so it's as good a time as any to examine the
quality of the networks' major-minor output. In this we cannot ignore
the contribution from Scottish Television and BBC Scotland. Over the
past few years both have established themselves as major players in the
game (Scottish is the largest supplier of children's programmes to the
ITV network, with its Fun House and Art Attack being the top-rated shows
in the 1995 summer season; BBC Scotland's Fully Booked has just
completed a highly successful network run).
So what is in store for our sprogs over the next few months? Well,
some things never change; Blue Peter is back. Yet again. At least ITV
had the good grace to dump Magpie years ago. Here's a programme which
tries desperately hard to keep moving with the times. But there's only
so many things you can do with the cardboard bit from a toilet roll.
Mind you, the new series is a bit racy; it breaks with tradition and
introduces a fourth presenter (Katy Hill). But it is to no avail. Blue
Peter remains stuck in its own ''Here's-one-I-made-earlier'' time warp.
In our hi-tech Nintendo age, do kids still want to know how to make
things with empty Fairy Liquid bottles and sticky-backed plastic? I
doubt it. Today they don't want to make things; they want to destroy
things. And, no harm to the happy, smiling, presenters, but aren't they
just a wee bit patronising to their viewers? They all sound like your
big brother or sister (and who ever listens to their big brother or
sister?).
Better, much better, is Byker Grove, which makes a welcome return for
a new series this week. This Newcastle-based drama is so damned good
that you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. It has a real attitude
(which is not a problem) and it takes its young audience seriously;
accepts that kids have a brain and a social conscience. The storylines
are contemporary and, on occasions, controversial. It is none the worse
for that. Last time round, the series didn't miss and hit the wall.
Jemma's death, teenage homosexuality . . . all human life was there. And
then, to cap it all, someone torched the youth centre.
The new series (which opens on Tuesday with the Grove completely
refurbished after the fire) promises to be equally hard-hitting. Among
the topics dealt with are homelessness, a child who attempts to
''divorce'' her father, and a teenager's unhealthy obsession with a pop
group.
Meanwhile, on ITV on Tuesday there is the fourth episode in the
current series of The Ward, which is Casualty for kids and serves to
prove that Granada still maintains an enviable reputation for fine drama
production. The programme was devised by Paul Abbot who won a Bafta
award for Cracker and Band of Gold. Again, the watchwords are
contemporary and controversial. This week tensions are running high as
the staff prepares for an influx of casualties from a fire and explosion
at a local school.
For younger children, the best bet at present is Carlton's enchanting
animation series, Wolves, Witches and Giants, which presents humorous
modern adaptations to traditional fairy tales like Little Red Riding
Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk. Narrated by Spike Milligan, it pitches
the classic stories into contemporary surroundings -- Three Little Pigs
on skateboards. This week it's Hansel and Gretel.
Also starting on BBC1 this week is the third and final series of the
award-winning cartoon, The Animals of Farthing Wood. Clearly inspired by
Watership Down, it's charmingly designed to make your weans go all yon
gooey way. Byker Grove it ain't.
And so, finally, to Live and Kicking. The format is now a familiar one
(basically it's the same as Going Live and Fully Booked but with
different presenters). You get a big studio, a group of children, a
couple of 'toons, a handful of guests, and a cordless telephone -- and
then you mix them altogether in television's equivalent of a Kenwood
blender.
Among the guests in the first of the series are Grant from Eastenders,
BoyZone, and Richard Branson. But, worry not, there are a couple of
highlights as well. The first is Emma, of course. The second is Rugrats,
one of the funniest cartoons around.

IT IS not as unusual as Dick Louden suggests for an educational
organisation to reduce its fees (Award body's success marked by its
decision to reduce fees, September 19). The Scottish Examination Board
has reduced its fees in the last three years as follows: 1993, #16.95
per presentation; 1994, #15.40; 1995, #15.20.
If Dick Louden is correct and SCOTVEC has reduced its fees by running
down its surplus, then the Scottish Examination Board is quite different
since it has no surplus: a surplus in any year is set against the
following year's budget. The savings to education authorities are
therefore produced by increased efficiency and strict control of costs.
The board employs some 7000 teachers every year to conduct its
examinations and they produce a very high quality, professional service
in return for fees that are far below those obtained in other
professions.
The board would therefore like to thank all the teachers,
invigilators, and administrative staff in schools who have made it
possible for the board to produce a service which is admired, not only
throughout the UK but, to judge by the visitors from many countries who
come to visit us and who ask for our consultancy services, by
educationalists around the world.
Scottish education has every reason to be proud of its innovative and
efficient examination system. The young people who received their
certificates this year are the most recent clients of a service which
began in 1888 and aims for constant improvement in the validity,
reliability, and efficiency of its assessment.

THANK heavens that someone has finally proved what I have long
suspected, namely, that three-tiered wedding cakes were invented by the
Victorians to put their wedding guests off sex (September 13).
Dr Simon Charsley, of Glasgow University, has enhanced the reputation
of sociology by his conclusive findings on this subject.
The sight of a happy couple striving to drive a chisel into the
confectionery causes hilarity, but the champagne-toting onlookers are, I
fear, unaware that the white sepulchre being hacked about contains a
fiendish, strategically placed Victorian anti-aphrodisiac.
Having attended many weddings in my professional capacity, I have
always taken great care not to eat the cake -- a precaution for which my
22 children rise up and bless me!
I was warned off by an old lady who, long ago at a Victorian wedding,
had been lured into partaking of the cake and, as a result, had only had
10 children -- a poor score for those days.
However, as she used to say, they all grew up to become sociologists
and so her conscience was clear.
Now we have safely left the sex-crazed Victorians far behind, I have
noticed that on the rare occasions anyone gets married these days
personalised cakes are the in-thing.
''Kokernut Kisses'' are well-thought of; and many of the brides like
to use the left-overs from their baby's Christening cake (to show that
marriage is one of their bridegroom's range of options).
Puddings are also popular with brides, and many are in the ''Pudding
Club'' and good at it.
That new state of grace ''co-habitation'' is in, the wedding cake out.
That's progress -- cheesecake all round!

IF Ian Bell and Ruth Wishart peer at the human condition through the
cataract of secularism, their perception will differ, not in detail only
but fundamentally, from the perception of a Catholic who apprehends
humanity through the eyes of faith, who beholds each person to be a
unique act of creation, and who treasures the God-given dignity and
value of each of us from conception and throughout life (September 14
and 18).
Ian Bell's bitchiness and Ruth Wishart's degrading coarseness
ill-serve whatever cause it is they seek to advocate; they both
propagate division and so undermine human solidarity; they live in a
bilateral world of ''us'' and ''them''.
Like Pope John Paul II, Catholics are concerned to promote the justice
and freedom of each man and woman, of each boy and girl, of the unborn,
the aged, and the infirm. However, justice and freedom, we would
contend, can only flow from truth and love.
For Catholics and other Christians the source of truth is scripture
and the search for truth involves the medieval practice, Lectio Divina:
reflective, prayerful reading of the sacred text, the exploration of the
roles of people and the sense of words, contemplation of the passage and
openness to the Holy Spirit.
Further study would incorporate learning from the teachings of the
exegete, the theologian, the Early Fathers, the magisterium of the
Church, and the lives of the saints.
Thus, the early chapters of Genesis reveal that being male and female
are two ways of living in the image of God. Indeed, it is the very fact
that man and woman are made in the image of God which gives each of us
our dignity and enables us, if faithful, to live in communion, male and
female complementing each other.
In so doing, we reflect something of the infinite love of the persons
within the Trinity.
The dignity of each of us is, therefore, independent of our roles in
life; acceptance of each other's dignity is, moreover, the necessary
condition of justice and freedom.
Ruth Wishart and Ian Bell both promote individualism and expect
justice and freedom to emerge through a tactical redistribution of
power. Catholics would aspire to build a society where the dignity of
the person is the bond of human solidarity under God.

IT is beyond the man-made denominations within the Christian Church
which are under pressure at the present time, it is Christianity which
is in recession, and it is that which requires to confront the
propagation powers of self-sufficiency by a combined campaign of all the
elements of Christ's Church, to revitalise that which is basic to all
denominations.
Let the Roman Catholics, the Presbyterians, the Anglicans, the
Methodists, the Baptists, the Wee Frees, the Free Presbyterians, and the
Brethren all have their own approach to Christian worship. God does not
regard differences. He regards us.
Some day, probably by an event rather than a committee, God will unite
us all under His domain. Meantime let us form an alliance to retrieve a
Christian world, and why not use as a battle-cry that which Field
Marshal Montgomery said we were ''fighting for'' -- ''A kinder world, a
cleaner breed''?

<HEADLINE>Best by-laws for Loch Lomond</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>14</PAGE>
<ARTICLETYPE>CORRESPONDENCE</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>976240855</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE action of the Scottish Sports Council in objecting to the by-laws
proposed for Loch Lomond has been raised in an article (A wave of
acrimony) and letters (September 11 and 19). I think it will benefit
your readers if I explain the position of the council).
The council does not object in principle to the existence of by-laws
as part of a recreation management plan for the loch, which all parties,
including the council, agree is necessary for this popular and sometimes
busy inland water.
However, it wants these by-laws to be formulated as well as possible
to assist this management.
To achieve this purpose the council has had to lodge formal objections
as this was the only procedural avenue it found open to it, having not
been invited to be part of any two-way discussions during their
preparation.
The timing of this avenue, after drafting proposals which have to be
submitted to the Secretary of State, is part of a statutory procedure,
and thus is beyond the control of the council. We regret that this
procedure became necessary but we considered it essential to maximise
the benefits of the introduction of the by-laws.
The council has not acted on behalf of one type of sport but in the
interests of many different users of the water. For instance it objected
on behalf of fishermen because the proposed by-laws effectively ban the
use of their traditional low-powered outboard engines, and on behalf of
wind-surfers some of whom would have been unable to get their craft the
distance offshore required by the proposals to commence their sport.
The council recognises that environmental needs and the actions of a
minority of users, unfortunately often connected to power-boat
recreations, require the introduction of by-laws, and thus it supported
a number of the by-laws concerned with navigation and safety, and indeed
had previously suggested some strengthening in these areas.
The council has always supported the efforts of the governing bodies
of water sports to increase the competence of boat users and would
support further measures to increase their application on Loch Lomond.
Unfortunately, such measures are not included in the proposed by-laws.
Similarly the council supports the proposed by-law which would control
reckless use of boats on the loch.
However, these instances are just two examples where the council
considers that to achieve the objectives of the by-laws the proposals
restrict a sport unnecessarily. Thus it suggested changes. This
principle of objecting to unnecessary restrictions was applied to each
sport, including water-skiing and power-boating, which were therefore
given treatment equal only to other recreation users in the objections
lodged.
The council understands the concerns regarding noise and pollution and
has no objections to measures which limit the impact of sport on either
of these issues. However it considers the measures should contain the
impact, not restrict the sport. Unfortunately, judging from the article
and letters, much of the former is not related to sport, and the
proposed by-laws did not address this problem or the latter issue.
The council understands that the quality of a natural resource is what
makes it attractive to recreationists and residents but also to
sportsmen and women, and thus the council has a concern, alongside
others, in conserving that resource so that all might benefit. It is
this concern that has guided the council's action.

DESPITE the fact that the Scottish Sports Council will receive
substantial grants from the National Lottery fund, the council still
legislates against the small rural sporting organisations instead of
assisting them to encourage more participation through the provision of
better pavilions/clubhouses and facilities.
The ruling whereby a grant is restricted to 50% of the capital cost of
a building or equipment virtually rules out the prospect of building a
clubhouse (for example) costing in the region of #70,000.
It is considered that each application for grant should be assessed in
accordance with the needs of the organisation, financial status and the
ability to encourage more participants into the sport concerned.
The percentage should be based on these considerations and not a
blanket of 50% (which many of the wealthier urban clubs may be able to
afford).
While it is recognised that 25% of the total grant may be obtained
from other sources, this would still leave an impossible task for some
of the smaller (and poorer) sporting organisations to cope with.
Since the Scottish Sports Council is a quango, we despair of anyone
having the authority or the means to amend its rules in order to benefit
the smaller sporting clubs. Perhaps other readers or sporting
associations may have the answer.

THE letter pleading that the Dangerous Dogs Act is inconsistent and
should be repealed is ludicrous (September 12). Of course the Act is
inconsistent. Obviously it is at times difficult to identify dogs and
this has grave consequences for innocent dogs.
The Act is, however, a considerable improvement on the situation that
preceded it, especially if it prevents innocent children getting their
throats ripped out by bull terriers.
Despite its flaws the Act should obviously be extended to encompass
the muzzling of other dangerous breeds.
I am sure that considerable support exists to ensure that the use of
muzzles is extended.
Yes! it has all been said before, but the dog lobby never gives up.
Why doesn't it give the public a break?

I DON'T know what's worse, being a West of Scotland writer or not
being Alan Massie. While lecturing us on the duty of a novelist, David
Hall didn't say (September 16).
Having read his essay I was making my way through Greenock, a right
hotbed of West-of-Scottishness, when my road was barred by a happy wee
man. He essayed a breast stroke, genuflected, and gave me a chorus of
''Rock-a-bye Your Baby''.
I suppose I should have spurned him as an example of all that's wrong
with West of Scotland fiction, but I just said, ''Gau'n yersel, pal,''
and he went on his way, doubtless rejoicing.
A little way on, a tall, thin man strode down the hill towards me,
wearing a striped jersey of startling colours. Possibly as a result of
this, he wore dark glasses and carried a stick.
When we drew level he muttered, ''Aw right, Jimmy?'' I only had time
for a quick, ''Aye''.
From scenes like these, William McIlvanney's, and less directly, James
Kelman's, fiction springs. I felt uplifted by them, but then I've never
read Allan Massie.

THANKS to Braveheart, we are now enjoying a new game, playable only by
those who have seen the film (or read the book) and keen observers of or
participants in present-day politics.
The game consists of ''matching'' present day events, political
figures, movers and shakers, to the events and characters of the film.
Points are gained or lost according to internal consistency of the
scenario; volume of supporting evidence for each match (both pluses);
objections based on recorded historical fact (minus): and what at first
seem to be preposterous matches but which are sustained by believable
evidence (bonuses).
The game begins with all players agreeing to at least one match. So
far we have always been able to start with the equivalence of '' a vote
for SNP'' equals ''support for Wallace''.
Among the best games we have played to date was one in which Bruce was
matched to Michael Forsyth. At first glance this seemed preposterous but
nevertheless was so well-supported with reference to traitorous mentors,
personal ambition, genuine love for Scotland, etc, that it won many
bonus points.
A character match for Wallace has proved contentious within SNP teams,
their preference being to match with the party as a whole rather than
with an individual, but Jim Sillars as Wallace has had several
successful runs and Roseanna Cunningham may yet prove to be a fit.

* THEY are Hollywood's true elite -- stars who can ''open'' a picture
and all but guarantee money-in-the-bank for the producers. Some
intriguing insight into the really powerful before-the-camera big-screen
players has resulted from new research and there are surprises.
To ''open'' a film is to make one that earns at least $10m in the
first weekend in American cinemas. And once on the list it takes an
almighty number of multimillion dollar flops to be kicked off.
So, you think you can name the five top leading men who studios
regarded as good as a cashed cheque? Well, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Mel
Gibson, Kevin Costner, Robert Redford, Bruce Willis, and even Eastwood
don't make the list. Yes, they have hits but not always ''openers''.
Audiences will go to see Gibson in action as Braveheart but ignored him
as Hamlet -- Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing made more at the
box office.
Alphabetically, the big men are Sean Connery, Tom Cruise, Michael
Douglas, Harrison Ford, and Tom Hanks. Connery has been on the insider
list for nearly 30 years. This is how the game works. He starred with
Richard Gere in First Knight (being paid $8m) and, apart from Stallone's
Judge Dredd, it was the biggest financial disaster of the past year. The
film lost $50m.
Now, Connery is getting $12m to play an ageing convict co-starring
with Nicolas Cage in Disney's Alcatraz action movie The Rock. Why?
Simply Hollywood economics.
First Knight, on its first weekend, made $10m. The thinking is if he
can ''open'' that dud he can do the same for The Rock. A studio
executive explained: ''You sit down at a meeting with your video and
international people and you crunch the numbers. If you have a film with
Nicolas Cage and, say, Ed Harris, you get one set of numbers. You put in
Connery's name and the numbers go way up. He's very big overseas.''
Connery is therefore an insurance policy albeit an expensive one. And
there are only so many policies that can be purchased. All the studios
want big summer action films and winter comedies. The Big Five can
therefore command huge payoffs and percentage deals which along with
marketing costs are driving movie budgets into the financial
stratosphere. Of course, it's catch-22 -- the higher the cost the more
you want insurance.
The pure action stars are not as versatile as The Big Five. When Tom
Cruise said he was interested in making Interview With A Vampire
negotiations with everyone else halted. The film made $45m in its first
week. Harrison Ford's recent films like The Fugitive and Clear and
Present Danger have all topped $100m. Next, he's in the romantic comedy
Sabrina.
Michael Douglas is the master of male melodramas like Disclosure but
next he's starring with Annette Bening, Mrs Warren Beatty, in the
romance The American President. Tom Hanks is Mr Eclectic -- four
different hits in a row: Sleepless in Seattle, Philadelphia, Forrest
Gump, and the present Apollo 13 which will win him another Oscar
nomination.
The Big Five leading ladies are as diverse as Hanks's career. New girl
on the list is Sandra Bullock. So far this year she ''opened'' While You
Were Sleeping and The Net to $10m weekends. Her asking price is now $6m
a film. Disney have signed Whoopi Goldberg for $20m for two films,
confirming her status. Julia Roberts can, amazingly, still attract
attention; her Something to Talk About just made $11.1m in its opening
weekend. Streisand works so infrequently that everything she does is an
''event'' and guarantees many bums on seats. Demi Moore is the champion.
She is getting $12.5m -- a record for an actress -- to star in
Striptease. Just more pricey insurance for box office gold.
Meg Ryan, who gets an ''honourable'' mention in clout control, is to
co-star in a remake of director Stanley Donen's 1967 classic Two For The
Road. The stars then were Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney with Jackie
Bisset making an early appearance. It's being ''updated for the 1990s''
-- that probably means measles is not going to be the difficult disease
-- by sharp-penned Carrie Fisher.
* WATCH for an outcry next week following last night's official
international screening of the controversial Showgirls which is
frame-to-frame packed with nudity, profanity, implicit immorality in the
story of a seedy Las Vegas lap dancer. The Basic Instinct team of
director Paul Verhoeven and superstar screenwriter Joe Eszterhas are
happy to accept the equivalent of a Hollywood X-certificate. They're
gambling that interest will be too vast to mainstream audiences, making
the film a hit. Video and overseas sales is a little hedge on the bet.
* SHARON Gless and Tyne Daly are returning for a series of television
Cagney and Lacey movies.
* FRANK Sinatra may have looked out of it at the opera but his golf
cart being auctioned at New York's Christie's on December 1 is expected
to bring thousands of dollars. It has Ol' Blue Eyes emblazoned on one
side and Lady Blue Eyes on the other. He always was a swinger.
* PULP Fiction is being spoofed in Plump Fiction which starts filming
next week . . . director Arthur Penn is in South Africa with Nigel
Hawthorne, Louis Gosset Jr, and Eric Stolz rehearsing his political
drama Inside.
* WITH Jane Austen the big star on BBC1 tomorrow evening arrives the
word from America of a gloriously enthusiastic reaction to Emma
Thompson's adaptation of Sense and Sensibility. Columbia Studios are
delighted with preview screening reactions -- 75% said they would
recommend the movie. ''That's the sort of figures we used to get for
Eddie Murphy comedies,'' said one executive. Times Change. Transatlantic
Austen will be on the best-seller list next. So far, Columbia have only
five requests for interviews with her. Wait till Pride and Prejudice
gets on America's Masterpiece Theatre.

ITS conference finds the SNP in an unusually strong position as
measured by opinion polls -- just over a quarter of Scottish opinion
favours it. Should its support grow much further, there is every reason
to believe that it would achieve a significant increase in its
parliamentary representation. It has suffered from the relatively even
spread of its support which prevents it enjoying the sort of strength
the Liberal Democrats enjoy because of their rural concentration. There
comes a time, however, when evenly spread strength delivers big rewards
if that strength can grow only a little more, a fact which is obvious in
a four-party system, such as Scotland has. The SNP must not be far from
that point, though it remains to be seen how opinion will react to the
intense campaigning of a General Election and the course of the debate
which that provides.
At some stage the popular argument about Scotland's future has to
provide the ammunition for hard calculation. In all politics debate, and
disagreement, is about the division of the national cake and the extent
of fairness in that process. It may be fuelled by emotion -- and
nationalism is a powerful emotion -- but, like patriotism, emotion is
seldom enough. There has to be a large numerate element in what looks at
first like a constitutional matter only.
Mr Salmond is certainly able to calculate. He surely made the right
decision yesterday when his confident speech committed the SNP to a
devolved assembly (basically the Labour and Lib Dem proposal) for the
country's immediate constitutional future. That is less than the party
would like, but those who demand independence or nothing, and counsel
boycotting anything less than a sovereign parliament, are in danger of
making themselves irrelevant. If the SNP accepted that strategy they
would leave to others all the opportunities any new institution must
confer. They would be marginalising themselves to avoid compromise. Mr
Salmond -- and Mrs Margaret Ewing earlier -- see the dangers in that
approach: they want to walk where it is obvious that contemporary
opinion will not allow them to leap.
The same solid calculation informs Mr Salmond's approach to matters as
different as the rhetoric of nationalism and the components of a modern
nation state. In both cases he maintains the liberal consensus which
runs through British political life and marks the mainline SNP as part
of that common culture. He is against the language of extremism, and he
is well aware, as some SNP enthusiasts are evidently not, of how
severely opinion would adversely react to it were the SNP to adopt it.
Political nationalism has not enjoyed a benign history this century, and
the SNP has managed to avoid any taint from the past living on now. Mr
Salmond manages it so: and in that context his attempt to stretch the
definition of the nation to include post-war immigrants does him credit,
and widens his party's electoral appeal. Where nationalism has
previously tended to exclude those not normally thought of as members of
the national community, his formula is inclusive.
Scotland will become a separate and independent state if a majority of
the Scottish electorate vote for it. It seems that majority opinion is
in fact happy with the Union, but wants it substantially modified in the
direction offered by Labour and the Lib Dems. Mr Salmond believes that
this modification is an acceptable beginning. It is obviously not the
end of his party's ambition. That formula should unite his party: the
purists would divide it. Other evidence suggests that divided parties do
not prosper.

THE Euro-summit in Majorca is more social and cosmetic than
significant. It is too brief to address many topics seriously. It does,
however, allow for the establishment and continued strengthening of
personal relationships between political leaders; and it will permit
private and relaxed discussion about sensitive matters best considered
quietly without much publicity -- the Prime Minister's talks with his
Irish counterpart being a case in point. It will also permit quick
discussions on what are clearly delicate matters, like the future of a
common currency in the light of Mr Waigel's remarks about Italy's
present inadequacy to join one. His opinions upset the Italians but
their position should be a matter of fact rather than opinion, and it is
shared by most others.
The danger with Europe is that its enthusiasts run too fast for mass
opinion. The sudden disillusion with the Union in Sweden, and a longer
operating disquiet, disclosed in the French referendum, should give all
enthusiasts pause: ''Do less but better,'' Mr Major's prescription for
the EU, is also that of Mr Santer. Its prudence recommends it. As the
Union expands into east and central Europe the strains will be enormous;
nothing will be gained if it is allowed to unravel elsewhere.
Majorca will pave the way for Maastricht Two, but it looks as if
prudence will reign there as well.

THERE'S been lot of Italy on the wireless this week. Luciano Pavarotti
was enthusing away to Jeremy Isaacs on Radio 4's Kaleidoscope. He was
wonderfully expansive as you would well imagine and conveyed, like many
opera singers seem to, a sensuality about his work, his art, which was
not metaphorical but literal.
The writer A L Kennedy, in her novel, gave a wonderful description of
his facial expression when he sang as if seemingly surprised at the
extraordinary music pouring out of his voice: listening to him in
conversation was so refreshing because of the almost amazed joy in
living a life focused on artistic delight.
On Radio 2 we had Italy Day -- and Jimmy Young was in Rome. I had a
little difficulty finding the programme because I had imagined that
there would be Italian music playing and I kept getting Rod Stewart
instead. But it was the right station and mixed in with Rod and Sinatra
singing Three Coins in the Fountain, there was some entertaining,
enjoyable interviewing going on.
He was having lunch with a young Italian couple, their baby and a
friend. Young was playing the amiable and informed tourist and the
discussion was relaxed and civilised. When asked about the Church's
stance on birth control in the light of Italy's plummeting birth rate,
the laughter was quite familiar to me: Laura, a teacher and mother of
three, said that Italians went to church but didn't listen so much.
The couple, living in an extremely expensive city with a mortgage to
pay, and no extended family in the vicinity to help out, could not have
sounded less angst-ridden about their reproductive choices.
When asked about the Italian health service, the message was clear --
in spite of the contributions automatically deducted from State
employees, no-one who could help it risked the public sector and went
private instead.
When Young told them the advice he'd heard was that if you got ill in
Italy don't head for the hospital, make for the airport, there was quite
genial consensus.
The traffic remains the same. One essential adjustment that you always
have to make when visiting Italy is remembering that zebra crossings
don't matter.
Familiar, too, was that graciousness which our island lacks about
speaking a foreign language. The mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, was
apologetic about the standard of his English which actually was fine. He
is called the Moped Mayor because being a Greenie, trying to sort out
the city's appalling traffic problems, that is his favourite mode of
transport.
He came across as concerned, liberal, and well-dressed. Now, I am not
just saying that. As a coda to the programme, Young informed us that
Rutelli was 42, and looked ''like a Hollywood film star''. Left of
centre, environmentally concerned, sensitive and drop-dead gorgeous --
they must be getting something right.
Lest I be accused of being frivolous, I make mention of this only as a
cultural commentator. I just can't think of any British equivalent that
Young could have described in this way. (I mean, we have got Sloane
Rangers snorting on about how handsome Portillo is -- and while Blair is
certainly stunning compared to Major, that is hardly an indicator of
anything much, is it?)
This is not aesthetic fascism, reader, just a harmless piece of
Italianate nostalgia before I talk about this week's Women of the World
episode (BBC Radio Scotland) called Sexual Violence.
Female circumcision in Somalia (and elsewhere): if ever there was an
abuse of language, right up there with ethnic cleansing, it must be
that. Genital mutilation, I was once told, was a culturally insulting
way to describe a custom which a Western feminist could not begin to
understand and had no right to question.
Six thousand young girls undergo this libidinal massacre every day.
The editor of the programme, Val Atkinson, presenter Louise Tait, and
producer Karen Coleman, by putting this programme out, are to be lauded.
Such violation is beyond the dubious claims of cultural relativism and
its euphemistic horror.

POLITICAL issues are not fixed. They come and go. Many invite
consensus and are solved. The best-known example is the question of the
franchise which excited opinion from the late-eighteenth century until
our own which settled the matter with the most universal formula -- one
citizen, one vote. If it is possible to identify old divisions which no
longer exist, it is equally possible to anticipate new ones.
There is a threshold in public consciousness which has to be crossed
before something becomes a political matter. Even then it requires
differing reactions before politics is really engaged -- it may be that
opinion achieves consensus without division, a case in point being
contemporary society's awareness of the need to enable as far as
possible its disabled citizens. A coming issue which might invite a
similar response is the supremacy of satellite television channels in
sports coverage.  More and more, it looks as if great national and
international sporting events will be available only to subscribers to
satellite TV, in particular Sky, which is well down the road to
achieving monopoly (certainly oligopoly) in the field. If anything this
tendency will be strengthened. The unfortunate outcome could easily be
that great sporting events will be viewable only by direct payment. So
far this is just a trend, but it is a strong one sustained by powerful
argument to the effect that the rights have been paid for and are simply
being sold on.
There is a wider public interest which needs to be argued. Its
political nature has been identified by Sir Paul Fox in the Huw Weldon
Memorial lecture. He anticipates the monopoly; he argues against its
establishment. Great sporting events belong to us all (and not just
those who can pay satellite subscriptions). They should not be
permanently scooped up by a giant TV monopoly. This is not yet a major
political issue but it should be -- and it will be.

THE score last night in Edinburgh: Crystal Clear Opera 1: the Killer
Cougher 4 (at least). Okay, that's facetious, but even if the young
touring opera company had produced a world-class performance last night
in Edinburgh, it would have been wrecked by one of the loudest and most
persistent coughers that has ever erupted in an opera house.
That this person stayed the course, either impervious or oblivious to
the fact that she managed to distract and incense an entire audience was
beyond credulity. (It was also infectious, spreading spasmodically
throughout the auditorium.) Even if on duty, I'd have left if similarly
affected. She was sitting in the dress circle, she should have been
ejected, and I hope she's reading this.
Crystal Clear's production of Puccini's masterpiece was an
unsensational, workmanlike production, graced by a few elegant,
stereotypical Japanese screens and some sensitive lighting washes.
Principal singers Andrew Forbes-Lane (Pinkerton) and Fiona O'Neill in
the title role had compatible tenor and soprano voices: both strong, but
with a hard, bright top and not a lot of warmth. Rather letting down the
name of the company, O'Neill failed to bring any clarity to her words
and was virtually unintelligible, even though the opera was sung in
English.
There was no chorus -- their lines were sung by other cast members --
and the accompaniment, conducted by Martin Handley, was provided by a
chamber ensemble (octet of strings, single woodwind, and a synthesiser).
It was intimate and quite effective, though a bit thin in the surging
climaxes. Not earth-shattering stuff, but an interesting and musically
aware company.

<HEADLINE>Shock tactics which also advertise cynicism</HEADLINE>

CONTRARY to what many people think, advertising in this country is
subject to censorship. Broadcasting is governed by one set of rules and
non-broadcast media by another. Suppose you were shocked and offended by
an advert then you could ask for action to be taken.
However, the Advertising Standards Authority, which exists for
non-broadcast advertising, defends shock tactics in advertising by
charities and pressure groups if the shock is a ''true representation of
the charity's cause''.
An example would be the Zero tolerance campaign which used a pair of
fists tattooed Love and Hate with the caption ''which one will he give
her tonight?'' as a way of shocking people into recognising the plight
of battered women. Never mind that it had probably zero effect on bully
boys.
The trouble with such tactics is that they so easily become more and
more provocative in an attempt to get the shock effect. Usually the
public would be forgiving (like the ASA) if sincerity of purpose could
be shown.
But what about when these tactics are used in a cynical, even
supercilious, way to promote a commercial product. Two recent instances
spring to my mind and they are the reason I have chosen this topic.
The first is the TV advert for Tennent's lager which shows a man tied
up in chair, stretching the elastic rope to breaking point as he
attempts to dip his tongue into a glass of foaming beer on the far side
of the room. Just as he appears to be about to reach it, the rope whangs
him back against the far wall, wincing in agony as the caption
''MasochisT'' appears on the screen. It's a bit kinky but not
necessarily offensive.
However, a few weeks ago during the climax of a repeat of Prime
Suspect this particular advert was shown just prior to the scene in
which the serial killer is revealed to have kept women in a lock-up,
where they were tied up and tortured before meeting disgusting deaths.
Coincidence that the advert surfaced just at this moment? Oh no. It is
not a secret that there are agencies who act for the advertisers and can
bid for a specific time within programmes for their advert which will
maximise its impact.
The TV companies like this tactic because it drives up their revenue.
I do not know the name of the sleazy person who thought it would be a
clever idea to show the ''MasochisT'' at that point. He probably does
not work for Tennent's but for one of the agencies. However, he has lost
Tennent's one customer.
Those who think it is all just a joke must have a very sick sense of
humour if it extends to making jokes about serial killers who rape and
torture their victims. But it is not only within advertising and
pornography that the shock effect is deployed.
The new breed of comedians excel in foul-mouthed, crapulous shock
tactics. It is all so unimaginative. Like a naughty little boy saying
bad words until he manages to annoy someone.
I felt like that about Billy Connolly's infamous Crucifixion sketch.
It was a very nasty piece of work, relying on the fart factor for its
impact -- a loud noise and a lingering unpleasantness. Most of us
disagree with what lies behind Pastor Glass's public pickets at public
events, but on this occasion he did a good job, and managed to rattle
Connolly's self-satisfied attitude towards those who found it offensive.
I hope Connolly felt guilty about sneering at something which he was
brought up to regard as sacred.
Alas he is now among the more staid of the stand-up comedians. Perhaps
many of us have been polite too long and have not booed these boors. We
let them shock us and our silence acts as an echo chamber.
When an advertiser erected a huge advert for a chocolate bar outside
the Maudsley psychiatric hospital which read ''it's REALLY nutty!'', the
advertisers were ordered to take it down by the ASA. In the churches, we
used to have such powers but now any schmuck can pour public contempt on
Christianity with impunity. (NB If they tried it on religions practised
by ethnic minorities it would be a very different story.)
On Paisley Road West in Kinning Park, diagonally opposite the church
of which I am minister, there is a huge poster advertising Red Bull
fizzy drink which reads ''Clergymen in heterosexual scandal''. It is
part of a series using ''ironic humour''.
Presumably the joke is that we clergy are all a bit suspect in the
hormone department. Forgive me if I find it as flat as I find a can of
the sugarolly water it advertises.
When I was a little lad, one of the silly things we got up to was
reading the naughty bits in the Bible. Giggle, giggle, we went, as we
got our first taste of shock effect.
It seems rather appropriate to recall that immature mindset when
thinking about the advertising type who thought it up, and especially
Isaiah 36, verse 12 which might well act as their motto.

GOOD on Brian MacKinnon for showing us all how complacent and uncaring
the teaching profession in this country has become (September 20).
Half the teachers at Bearsden Academy were there when he attended
first time round. What personal interest did they show in him and did
they bother to get to know him properly?
The professors of Dundee University will huff and puff that he
falsified documents. But even they must see that it was merely to buck a
cranky, creaking, ageist system so he could better himself.
After his late start, MacKinnon, ''a real asset to the school'',
according to the headmaster, will go far.
The university would be better advised putting him forward for an
honorary degree in recognition of his initiative than hounding the poor
fellow.

Roy Rogers asks where all the Scots have gone in a union with a
traditionally strong Clydeside presence
THE battle for control of Britain's largest manufacturing union, the
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, is being waged on both
sides of the Border.
Two Geordies are slugging it out to decide who should fill the
presidency left vacant by Bill Jordan's move to Brussels to become the
first British general secretary of the International Confederation of
Free Trades Unions.
A Lancastrian and possibly another Geordie are contesting the AEEU
general secretaryship left empty by the recent early retirement on
health grounds of Paul Gallagher.
Under the terms of the amalgamation between the AEU and the EETPU,
only members of the engineering section (the old AEU) will elect the
president with the electrician members (formerly EETPU members) electing
the general secretary. When both posts come up for re-election in five
years time they will be decided by a ballot of the entire membership.
A third key engineering union post traditionally held by Scots, the
general secretaryship of the AEEU-dominated Confederation of
Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, has already gone to Tynesider Alan
Robson, who last year succeeded the late Alec Ferry.
So where are the Scots in a union and an industry in which Scots have
played a major role, providing such leaders as the late Sir John Boyd
and the recently retired Sir Gavin Laird?
It was no coincidence that in the Star Trek television series the
chief engineer on the Enterprise was ''Scottie'', more a reflection of
the days when Scottish-built ships, locomotives and heavy plant were
much in evidence the world over.
Scottish AEEU executive councillor Jimmy Airlie would probably have
stood a good chance in the presidential race but cannily declined to
stand, feeling that it was time to make way for a younger man. And he
may well have struck a chord with the membership, for 44-year-old
Tyneside district secretary Davey Hall, with left-wing support, easily
topped the first ballot and must be in with a very strong chance of
defeating right-wing North-east executive councillor Jackie Crystal,
aged 60, in next month's run off.
Victory for Hall, a long-established Labour Party member and a
supporter of Tony Blair, would suggest that the engineering section
members at least are tired of the old political infighting and are keen
to skip a generation in order to shake their almost moribund union back
to life.
The electrical section, the old EETPU, looks less ready for change,
however, with acting secretary 58-year-old Ken Jackson seemingly set to
win the general secretaryship whether or not he is challenged by
executive member Barry Davies from Newcastle. Nominations close on
October 7.
The impending early retirements of Scottish AEEU executive councillors
Pat O'Hanlon, this November, and Jimmy Airlie, a year later, mean that
AEEU members will soon get an opportunity to decide who should fill one
of the top trade union posts in Scotland.
Like eight or more other top AEEU officials, including Sir Gavin
Laird, O'Hanlon and Airlie are taking early retirement offers made in a
desperate bid to kick-start the AEEU out of the ossification which set
in with the amalgamation three years ago.
They will be replaced by one unified executive councillor elected by
all 50,000 or so Scottish AEEU members -- a process that will be
repeated elsewhere thoughout the UK as other executive seats fall
vacant. Balloting, probably on a single transferable vote basis although
that has yet to be finalised, is likely to be next spring with the
victor ready to take office when Jim Airlie goes in just over a year's
time.
Potential candidates are already jockeying for position and it looks
like being at least a four-horse race with political, geographical and
craft issues serving to complicate matters.
The traditional left which has tended to dominate the engineering
section in recent years has lined up behind Paisley, Dumbarton and
Greenock district secretary John Quigley, while the right has selected
Edinburgh district organiser Doug Rooney as its champion.
Electrical section candidates are expected to include moderate
national organiser Danny Carrigan, who although a Glaswegian may be
handicapped by being London-based. A former Clyde shipyard shop steward,
Carrigan stood against Paul Gallagher for the EETPU general
secretaryship four years ago.
Hard-left Edinburgh Scottish Power worker Willie Black is also
expected to toss his hat into the ring.
With all four likely Scottish candidates aged 47 or thereabouts the
winner could be in a prime position to challenge for the AEEU presidency
and/or general secretaryship when they are thrown open to the entire
membership.
Only then will it become clear whether Scots engineers can regain some
of their lost influence or whether we should perhaps expect any new
series of Star Trek to feature ''Geordie'' as chief engineer of the
Enterprise.

Beyond Beijing: Grace Franklin explains why her journey to China for
the UN World Conference on Women was well worthwhile
SINCE returning from China early this week I've been amused and amazed
at the reaction to my trip. Having travelled the several thousand miles
to Beijing to attend the United Nations Fourth World Conference on
Women, I know the journey was worthwhile.
I survived the mud and the rain of Huairou where the ''fringe'' event
of the Women's Forum took place. I beat the system and lived in a hotel
not officially designated for journalists. I didn't get picked up by the
security police, though I was followed and checked out -- as everyone
was.
But most people ask me, ''Why bother going to Beijing? What has it to
do with women in Scotland?'' The answer is frighteningly obvious. If we
don't bother with what has happened in Beijing we will have to be
content with what we are given. What we are given, by those who have it
in their power to give, is as little as possible.
Those things we might wish for -- health facilities, safety from
violence, closing of the poverty gap -- all come a long way down the
political and financial agenda; assuming they are still on the agenda
after items such as military spending.
While we might feel like taking action -- or at least discussing the
terrible plight of women in other countries, China included, where
freedom is a dirty word -- it is a sobering moment to look round a body
of 30,000 women from 189 countries and recognise that those so-called
underdeveloped countries are better organised, better represented and
fighting harder than we are for what they believe in.
Only half-a-dozen women from Scotland made it to Beijing. Worthy
bodies such as SEAD had estimated raising #10,000 to send six or seven
delegates. They raised nothing and sent no-one in the end. The Church of
Scotland Woman's Guild sent two delegates thanks to a legacy. In the
end, those who got to Beijing had to pay their own way.
The apathy to this global event on women's issues is obvious.
What little media coverage there has been has either trivialised the
UN event, belittled women or patronised the issues and the people. But
that isn't new -- or news -- to women. Women know first-hand that what
they do, think, say, and want is of lesser importance than anything any
man might say.
Again, it is salutary to discover that in China two entire TV channels
were dedicated to the conference and the parallel Women's Forum.
Keeping in mind that everyone on that world stage was a pawn in a
political game, it is worth distinguishing what women got out of the
forum and what women will get out of the UN conference.
The forum attracted 30,000 women from around the world. It ran for 10
days in town called Huairou where well over 3000 different events took
place. They ranged from the plight of refugee and displaced women in
Azerbaijan to the role of women in mental health.
All were run by women involved in their particular subject. The
sharing of knowledge and the worldwide linking of experience will
reverberate around the globe. Especially as workshops on e-mail and
computer networks were extremely popular.
Women will get a great deal out of the forum experience. And the
friendships forged while battling through the mud of Huairou or
surviving the tents which collapsed and the unwelcome intrusions of
Chinese security police, will enable work to move forward faster.
The United Nations conference, on the other hand, was more constrained
and restrained.
Officially accredited delegates from non-governmental organisations,
such as Oxfam, were allowed through the hallowed portals of Beijing
International Conference Centre. Inside the three-ringed circus of the
UN-designated territory the NGO people were segregated from the
government delegations.
The government people were split into the working/negotiating teams
intent on finding the right words for the final text and those who sat
at their country's post in the plenary session, listening to the
speeches of the multitude of countries' and organisations' emissaries.
The president of the World Bank put on record his support of women and
the gender policies of his bank. The President of Peru told the world of
his fight with the Roman Catholic Church over health clinics women in
his country wanted. He won. Women won.
And in the plenary, Baroness Chalker, speaking formally for the UK,
asserted that partnership is the key to the advance of women. She said
governments may have to reallocate public resources, for example reduce
excessive military expenditure and increase investment in education and
health care, to create the right conditions for that development. She
didn't mention women and domestic violence in her speech.
For people from Scotland who know the value of the Zero Tolerance
campaign and who have seen the Scottish Office's campaign against such
violence, that was disappointing. But then perhaps because there was
no-one from the Scottish Office included in the UK Government
delegation, the Minister didn't know what was happening in Scotland.
And taking that thought further, if no-one from Scotland was in
Beijing to hear who was saying what and to see how things were being
manoeuvred, then people at home will never know the way the game is
being played.
Women will win this game of power, because what they might lack in the
corridors of power and in delegations abroad, they more than make up for
in the worldwide links they are becoming more skilful at using.

Robert Sim, builder; born May 12, 1939, died September 13, 1995
ROBERT SIM, who erected a monument to the 200 victims of the 1877
Blantyre mining disaster, died in hospital last week at the age of 56.
He had suffered from a heart condition.
The monument he raised at High Blantyre Cross in 1977 portrays a giant
lump of coal in which a pit wheel is set. It was intended as a tangible
tribute to the memory of the men and boys who had lost their lives so
pitiably a century before. The event, which haunted Mr Sim's
imagination, also turned him to poetry. A time capsule containing
mementos of the disaster is buried under the monument.
With a former business partner, Donald McAllister, Mr Sim devised the
formula for the glass-fibre from which the monument is made. The
monument was designed by the artist Neil Gordon. More than 1000 people
attended the opening ceremony. They included hundreds of Scottish miners
and their leader of the time, Mick McGahey. It remains a poignant
reminder of the industrial past of North Lanarkshire.
A quiet, generous family man, who helped found the Blantyre AA group
and enjoyed bowling, Mr Sim was educated locally and spent his working
life in the building and construction industry, setting up his own
company a decade ago. He leaves a wife, Jean, two daughters, and two
grandchildren.

James Alexander McCash, engineer and poet; born October 5, 1902, died
September 13, 1995
JAMES Alexander McCash, who has died at the age of 92 in Ham, Surrey,
was a Scottish engineer with a taste for poetry.
A farmer's son, Mr McCash was born in Condorrat, Dunbartonshire, and
educated at Glasgow High School and Glasgow University, from which he
held a BSc. He worked with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Abadan, and
subsequently at British Petroleum's London headquarters and
Sunbury-on-Thames research laboratories.
On his retirement James McCash enjoyed writing both as an engineering
historian and as a poet. In the former capacity he penned studies of the
Scottish scientists Joseph Black (renowned for his work on the chemistry
of gases) and William Murdock (pioneer of gas lighting). As a poet,
James McCash won in 1972 the Johnnie Walker Scots poetry competition run
in conjunction with The Glasgow Herald.
This competition had as its theme a quotation from Sir Walter Scott --
''This is my own, my native land!'' It generated more than 700 entries.
Mr McCash's winning one was called Dies Aestivus. It describes -- in a
curious but invigorating mixture of couthiness and formal Latinate Scots
-- the farm-work of the boy poet.
The boy goes ''Tae fetch hame the kye frae their summernicht
habitude'' with his sheepdog Glen. Then, in demotic vein, to breakfast:
''Cheese is frae the hail Dunlop, the kitchen is oor salon./Honesty and
decency maintained withoot a hitch,/ And whisky's bocht in wickered
casks a twelve an' six the gallon.''
The sponsors, undisturbed by any invidious comparison with latter-day
whisky prices, awarded Mr McCash four pints of Red Label whisky as well
as #100.
Prizes (there were five runners-up) were handed over at a rather
surrealistic occasion in the Library of Glasgow Art School. The poet
Hugh MacDiarmid, who was patron of the judges, appeared with his wife
and small West Highland terrier, which proceeded to relieve itself
against the august pillars. A piper played.
The following year, James McCash himself turned patron of poets. He
endowed at Glasgow University the McCash Prizes (worth #450, #225, and
#150) in memory of his brother and sister, both medical doctors. These
were to be awarded annually for the best poem or poems in Scots and were
to be open to matriculated students and graduates and any officer of the
Scottish universities.
James McCash's own writing also encompassed a play, Resurrection in
the Gorbals, about Glasgow's grave-robber equivalents of Burke and Hare,
another play, Bedticks and Bloodstock, and a book of poetry called A
Bucolic Nickstick.
A small man with immense energy and enthusiasm for life, James McCash
was a freeman of the city of Glasgow by dint of being a hammerman. He
leaves a wife, Marion Ruth, a daughter, Anne, and grandchildren Claire
and James.

Profile / THE STUDENT
HE is a bright, focused 18-year-old who is about to begin an arts
degree at the university of his choice, but he seriously swithered about
taking up the offer. He's read about the alarming increase in drop-out
rates caused by student hardship and he's worried about making ends
meet. And will he get a job at the end of it all? His best pal's sister
graduated in the summer with an honours arts degree and, to improve her
employment prospects, she has enrolled on a one-year postgraduate
vocational MBA course; she's had to find #3000 for the course fees.
He is one of the growing band of students coming to university from
poorer backgrounds. Although he's on the maximum grant, its value has
been deliberately eroded by the Government, which wants students to
contribute towards their maintenance. By next year, half of the money
available to him on a full grant will come from the Government's Student
Loan Company. He'll have little option but to take out the loan and, by
the time he graduates in four years, he could owe about #4000. He'll
have to repay the money in fixed monthly instalments and already he
knows it's a burden he could do without at the start of his career.
He's the first member of his family to go to university and, although
his parents are justifiably proud of him, they cannot really afford to
give him much in the way of financial support. And they worry about him
going into debt. So he has joined the growing army of students looking
for part-time work in a restaurant, supermarket, anywhere, to supplement
their grants and loans. He knows it's not the ideal way to go about his
studies, so he'll have to make sure he manages his time properly. His
university is all too aware of the problem and advises students not to
work more than 12 hours a week.
* * *
SHE is about to begin her final year as a medical student. Course
demands mean that she hasn't had the opportunity to earn money from
vacation jobs recently and, to make matters worse, her outlays are
greater. So she'll graduate with debts of about #12,000 accumulated from
student loans, bank overdrafts, and credit card bills. Her bank is happy
to lend her money because she's guaranteed a hospital job as a junior
house doctor with a good salary when she graduates. But she'll have to
work all the hours, which is just as well because, with little spare
time during which to spend her salary, she hopes to pay off her debt in
a couple of years.
* * *
HE is in his thirties. He left school at 16, learned a trade, and
worked at several jobs between travelling abroad. After his last trip he
read about an access course, enrolled on it, passed, and got into
university. He's had more free time than he thought would be the case
but his options have been restricted by lack of cash. He's got a
part-time job cleaning but since he's coping well with the course
demands, he's looking for something more regular. He has no illusions
about getting a great job because, he believes, some employers will
think he'll be ''past it'' when he graduates. He might go into teaching.
* * *
SHE is also in her thirties, divorced, with two children. She wanted
to challenge herself but, as her qualifications were out of date, she
also had to take an access course before securing a place at university.
She lives in university accommodation but struggles to get by,
particularly since the Government has decided that, from the beginning
of this academic session, the mature students' allowance -- worth up to
#1070 a year depending on individual circumstances -- will no longer be
available. She has to pay for childcare after school and during the
holidays.
The vast majority of students can no longer claim any form of state
benefit but, since she has a family, she can ask for additional support
-- although her grant and student loan are classed as income in
determining benefit. Even if she had not taken out a loan it would have
been calculated as income.
* * *
THERE we have it. The student of the 90s is a multi-faceted creature
whose predecessors traditionally came to higher education from school,
but who:
* Increasingly arrives on campus via unconventional routes, bringing
unconventional qualifications to a sector which is far from elite.
* Has a bewildering array of courses from which to choose but who is
most likely to be studying business and administration (subjects which
attract 18% of total full-time numbers).
* Generally came from a comfortable background but who is now just as
likely to be the first student in the family, perhaps the street.
* Used to be 18 but could just as easily be 28, 38, or 48. About
one-third of our students are mature -- over 21.
Despite the hybrid nature of the nineties student he (or she, since
48% of undergraduates are female) shares a common denominator -- money.
As a recent report on undergraduate poverty from the Scottish
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux pointed out: ''Debt is a live
issue for almost every student.'' In the latest of their briefing papers
on higher education, UK university chiefs conclude: ''There is now
widespread recognition that the way in which universities and their
students are financed is breaking down and needs a major overhaul.''
The reason is simple. Student numbers have undergone a huge expansion
-- by more than 50% in the past 15 years -- but public funding per
student has contracted by 25% in the same period. University chiefs
accept that a scheme involving graduates making a contribution to their
higher education ''seems inevitable''. They want to ensure that such a
system is fair, contingent on income, and does not narrow access to the
sector.
A growing number of students and their representatives are coming to a
similar conclusion. In the meantime, the nineties student must soldier
on with a loans system which, Scottish Principals and English
Vice-Chancellors conclude, is ''neither equitable nor efficient.''
So financial considerations have a major -- some would say over
overpowering -- influence on his (her) life. The nineties student might
say: ''Happiness is a Saturday job at Safeway. Bliss is a double shift
on a Sunday at double time. Part-time work spells release from the grip
of poverty and, probably, the chance to buy beer. To today's student,
drink can be weekend worship.''
So has the beer-bar stereotype stood the test of time, even in the
lean, mean nineties? Up to a point, says Professor Andrew Miller,
Principal of Striling University. ''One of my duties is to live on
campus and I can assure you that fun is being had. I do very much
appreciate the high spirits that are still there, but sometimes they get
slightly out of hand. We started the semester last week and we had a few
late-night settling-in problems. Students are still students and they
are still enjoying themselves.''
But he recognises that the nineties student is much more serious than
his counterpart in, say, the sixties was. ''Although this country still
gives better maintenance to students than most European countries, the
cuts mean that students have to take things much more seriously
financially than they did. The fact that there are so many mature
students today adds to the seriousness. They have had to sacrifice jobs
to get the qualifications they missed out on before, so they don't want
to waste time. They want to get on with it.''
The nineties student accounts for 132,000 teenagers and adults and is
a major force in society, representing 40% of 18-year-olds. Professor
Miller welcomes the fact that he (she) is much more representative in
terms of social class. But, he says: ''The ones I really feel sorriest
for are those who come from low-income backgrounds because they are
being pushed on maintenance and they have nowhere to turn except
part-time work, and that affects their academic performance and their
chances in a competitive world.''
Lin McLean, of Strathclyde University's student advisory and
counselling service, believes the stereotype of the ''beer-swilling,
drug-taking student is no longer valid''. For her the nineties student
is ''exhausted, poor, perhaps a bit negative about the student
experience, apolitical, challenged quite strongly, and quite competitive
because of the lack of jobs.''
Life for the nineties student, she says, is a serious business with
fewer opportunities for fun than his (her) predecessor. So is it worth
the candle, particularly if you can't afford the wax? Yes it is, she
believes. ''Most students get through it, most look back on it as a
positive experience, although they might remember the hardships and
pressures. If you are going into the job market having a degree will
give you the edge. Also, it is an intellectual challenge, an opportunity
to question and explore. And for mature students that's such a
liberation.''
Stephen Magee, a 21-year-old who is about to go into his senior
honours year at Edinburgh University, agrees that higher education
presents a ''fantastic opportunity'' for intellectual, social, and
personal development. But there is a cost. ''If ever there was a time
when students lived an unreal, cosseted life it certainly isn't true
today. Most students are very focused. They don't have a choice. They
have to be aware of how much money is coming in and how much is going
out. They have to plan budgets as carefully as they can.''
Stephen, a former president of the university's student association,
knows of junior honours colleagues who thought seriously before
returning for their fourth year because of money worries. He
acknowledges he is lucky because his parents cover his costs at
university. He works part-time in a restaurant for money for the
luxuries -- ''chocolate bars, money to go out, a new watch strap,
batteries for the Walkman.''
As the nineties student contemplates the beginning of a new university
session next week he (she) will have the glittering prize of graduation
in sight, and will conclude that it is worth the commitment.

Donald Davie, poet and critic; born July 17, 1922, died September 18,
1995.
Donald Davie's career was, he will surely be regarded as one of the
lost leaders of English Literature in the British universities.
A tall man, of commanding voice and presence, he was born in 1922 of
shopkeepers in the mining town of Barnsley, West Yorkshire. From
Barnsley Holgate Grammar School he went to St Catherine's College,
Cambridge, where his education was interrupted by war service in the
Royal Navy.
He took the opportunity to learn Russian and Polish, before resuming
his studies at Cambridge and proceeding to a doctorate. This gave rise
to his first critical book, Purity of Diction in English Verse, which
has (among other good things) an epoch-making essay on the hymn-writer,
Charles Wesley, as a poet.
Davie held lectureships in Trinity College, Dublin, and in Cambridge
itself, before moving in 1964 to a foundation professorship at the
(then) new University of Essex. Rather than face the student
intransigence of that Year of Revolution, 1968, he transferred to
Stanford University, California. He succeeded as Professor of English
the great American critic, who was also a distinguished poet, Yvor
Winters.
In many ways, Winters was a figure whom Davie sought to emulate. Like
Winters, he was capable of a charming kind of battiness. Winters, for
instance, preferred as a poet Sturge Moore to Yeats; an opinion unique
to himself. Nevertheless, his arguments, however eccentric, may serve to
teach us something about both writers.
On the other hand, the preference of Davie for the Black Mountain
poets (especially Ed Dorn) over Robert Lowell is singularly
uninformative. This is on a par with much of his critical work.
Beginning as a stern formalist, in poetry as in criticism, Davie spent
several years truckling with the hugely overrated Ezra Pound, before
settling on Thomas Hardy as representative of an English tradition.
Behind the incisive prose style, then, there was degree of
vacillation. Davie's verse is technically adroit, and he was as a young
man associated with Philip Larkin and Kingsley Amis in a school of
poetry called The Movement. But his poems lack human warmth: ''A neutral
tone is nowadays preferred'' (''Remembering the Thirties'').
It is curious that two of his best poems concern buildings rather than
people: ''Never care so much/For leaves or people, but you care for
stone/A little more'' (''To a Brother in the Mystery''). It may well
prove that his most vigorous verse is in his poetic translations from
Russian and Polish, most notably The Forests of Lithuania where his
author, Adam Mickiewicz, supplied the emotions that seem wanting in
Davie's original poems:
Languid the farmer sought his livelihood
And checked his team and gazed, as if enquiring
What marvels gathered westward while he stood.
He asked the stork, whose white returning wing
Already spread above its native pine
Had raised the early standard of the Spring.
Perhaps, as poet, scholar, translator, critic and administrator,
Donald Davie over-extended himself. One is conscious of remarkable
abilities rather than sustained achievement. Possibly his long American
sojourn, a decade at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee after 11 years
at Stanford, did not do much for his later work. Had he held a Chair in
(say) Sheffield or Leeds, and remained in Britain, it is likely that the
present state of English in the universities would nowadays be more
hopeful.

Dr John Fitzsimons, CelticFootball Club's doctor; born March 3, 1915,
died September 3, 1995
THE death of Dr John Fitzsimons earlier this month touched generations
of Celtic footballers.
''Fitzie'' was the man who looked after the Parkhead players for
around four decades -- and, for another lengthy spell, was also team
doctor for the Scottish international side. The Doc or Fitzie, as he was
known to the players, was more than Celtic's club doctor. He had played
for the club and had an understanding of footballers' foibles. Even late
in life he enjoyed nothing more than joining the players in training
games.
His influence inside the Parkhead club also extended well beyond the
treatment room. During the reign of the late club chairman Sir Robert
Kelly, Dr Fitzsimons was a valued member of the chairman's kitchen
cabinet, a group Sir Robert regularly took soundings from regarding club
policy. The doctor, with his penchant for discussion and argument was an
important member of that group. And, when he voiced his opinions, the
chairman would listen.
Fitzie also liked to look after the spiritual needs of the players in
his care. He was, of course, a devout Catholic and I can still remember
an occasion in Rio De Janiero when he took several players off the team
bus which was heading for a Sunday morning training session and took
them instead to mass!
On that same trip in 1972 the then Scotland team manager Tommy
Docherty told me at the Maracana, that shrine of Brazilian soccer:
''I've never seen Fitzie happier -- he's just found a chapel in the
dressing room.''
Dr John Fitzsimons who was 80 years of age became in his lifetime a
part of the folklore which surrounds Celtic. That is how he will always
be remembered.

DR CHARLES Gourley, the former director of Tayside Health Board's
Occupational Health Service, who had a distinguished career in medicine
for almost 40 years, died at his home in St Andrews. He was 66.
Dr Gourley, who was a native of Johnstone, Renfrewshire, studied
medicine at Glasgow University and graduated in the 1950s. He
subsequently held a number of hospital appointments before entering
general practice in Dumbarton in 1959 and then post-graduate study.
Dr Gourley went to Tayside in 1967 as a research fellow in the
Department of Social and Occupational Medicine at Dundee University and
two years later took up a post in Edinburgh with the National Coal
Board. He later returned to Dundee to work with the health and safety
executive of the Employment Advisory Service. In 1975 Dr Gourley was
appointed director of Tayside Health Board's Occupational Health
Service. He retired in 1992.

Vicenzo Muccioli, controversial Italian anti-drugs crusader; died
September 19, aged 61
ANTI-drugs crusader Vicenzo Muccioli, whose implication in a
manslaughter case last year shocked Italians, died on Tuesday at the
rehabilitation centre he set up.
Muccioli was taken to hospital in Milan nine days ago but was returned
to his centre in San Patrignano in central Italy after falling into a
coma. The centre said he died after suffering respiratory problems and
brain damage.
His work with drug addicts had made him a national hero. But his
saintly image was tarnished last year when he was charged with
manslaughter in a sensational court case over the brutal killing of a
30-year-old addict at the centre.
Muccioli, who acknowledged he was an authoritarian, admitted he had
known that Roberto Maranzano was battered to death in 1989 but had kept
it secret. He was eventually cleared of manslaughter but given a
suspended sentence as an accessory to the crime.
He had previously been arrested in 1980 when police found six addicts
chained up in the kennels. But his rehabilitation centre, funded by
private donations, has flourished as a home to more than 2000 addicts
who produce wine, breed dogs and horses, run a clothing factory and
workshops, and grow their own food.

Allan Laing presents a guide to the best that's on offer on our TV
screens over the next week.
SATURDAY
* 40 YEARS OF ITV LAUGHTER (ITV) -- Or doesn't time fly when you're
enjoying yourself? Denis Norden, a man so boring that he could clear a
bar in two minutes, introduces a selection of classic sketches and
memorable moments from the mid-50s to the present day. Mind you, a
gander at the list of contributors rather suggests that laughter may
not, after all, be the best health tonic. Most of them are dead (Tommy
Cooper, Sid James, David Nixon, Peter Cook, Eric Morecombe, Arthur Lowe,
and Les Dawson) while others (Billy Connolly, Dudley Moore, Spike
Milligan) are well past their sell-by date. Still, there's always
Victoria Woods, Michael Barrymore and Jackie Dee to liven things up.
* JUST FOR LAUGHS (Channel Four) -- Comedy again as Frank Skinner
presents the first of six occasional visits to the world's most
prestigious laughterfest at Montreal. Now in its 13th year, the Canadian
comedy event attracts as many as 200 acts (some of them are actually
funny) from 18 countries (curiously, not including Albania). In the
first show, recorded at Montreal's Cafe Campus, Skinner is joined by
Eddie Izzard and America's current number one stand-up comic Richard
Jeni.
* FILM: LOCAL HERO (Channel Four) -- Bill Forsyth's finest moment (so
far). Inspired by a newspaper article about the oil boom in the North of
Scotland, it's a gentle and almost whimsical tale which harks back to
the golden age of British cinema. An American oil giant plans to replace
a charming Highland fishing village with an oil refinery. Do the locals
rebel? No, they're not that daft. You can see the dollar signs in their
eyes. Ironic, eccentric, satirical, and just plain brilliant, it stars
Burt Lancaster, Denis Lawson, Peter Capaldi, and Jenny Seagrove, and the
late, great Fulton Mackay. An absolute must for any self-respecting film
fan.
SUNDAY
* PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (BBC1) -- It is a truth, universally
acknowledged, that there is no-one better in all the world than the Beeb
for adapting classic English literature for the television screen. This
sumptuous and faithful six-part version of Jane Austen's wonderful
comedy of manners is a visual delight. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle
head the cast but Alison Steadman steals the show as the horrendous Mrs
Bennet, a woman in search of rich young husbands for her five daughters.
Writer Andrew Davies's splendidly witty screenplay, while designed to
attract as wide an audience as possible, will surely satisfy the most
die-hard Austen fan.
* SOUTH BANK SHOW (ITV) -- Tom Sharpe used to write the kind of books
which made you laugh out loud on a train. Through a series of achingly
funny and gloriously offensive novels, he was arguably Britain's finest
comic writer. And then, 12 years ago, writer's block set in and Sharpe's
prolific output dried up. Well, now he's back on rude form with a new
book, Granchester Grind, a sequel to his brilliant Porterhouse Blues. In
this rare television interview, Sharpe talks about his life and how his
early experiences in apartheid South Africa (he was deported for writing
plays of an ''offensive nature'') triggered the savage satire of his
first two books.
* CARL HIAASEN'S MIAMI (Channel Four) -- Hiaasen is a man of many
talents. He writes wacky Florida-based crime thrillers, he is a regular
columnist for the Miami Herald, and recently he penned a couple of songs
for American rock singer Warren Zevon. In this one-off documentary he
turns tourist guide as he takes you on a trip through Miami's flipside,
the part which the holiday brochures conveniently forget. You don't have
to have read his books to appreciate the programme -- but it certainly
helps. A warning: watch out for the scene involving the Coast Guards on
a routine search of a cargo boat. The tragic consequences are genuinely
shocking.
MONDAY
* THE X FILES (BBC2) -- A worrying trend is developing in this series.
Frankly, we are not getting enough of Special Agent Scully (the
wonderful Gillian Anderson). This week Duane Barry, an unhinged former
FBI agent, takes a group of people hostage in a travel agency. He
demands safe passage to the site where he claims he was once abducted by
aliens. Only problem is he can't remember where it is. Enter Mulder who
tries to negotiate the release of the hostages. When Special Agent
Spooky strays from the FBI script (and starts comparing notes on UFOs)
Barry is taken aback. Mulder trades places with a hostage. Meanwhile,
Scully discovers that Barry was shot in the line of duty and the injury
affected his brain and turned him into a pathological liar.
* FILM: ALIEN 3 -- A distinct feeling of deja vu here in the final
confrontation between Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the
murderous life form which just won't take no for an answer. Having
escaped from her battered ship, Ripley finds herself on Fiorina 161, a
desolate all-male prison planet, where (yes, you've guessed it) the
alien regenerates itself and causes havoc.
* OMNIBUS: ENIGMA (THE MAKING OF A HARDBACK HERO) -- Former journalist
Robert Harris shot to fame with the publication of his first novel, the
wartime thriller, Fatherland. It went straight to the top of the
best-seller list and has accumulated sales of some 4 million copies. So
how do you follow that kind of success? Well, with more of the same. And
it helps, of course, if you can get the BBC to film a documentary about
you and screen it to coincide with the publication of your follow-up
(Enigma, another wartime thriller). If nothing else it shows how,
nowadays, the success or failure of a particular publishing house often
rests with just one potential blockbuster.
TUESDAY
* SOLDIER, SOLDIER (ITV) -- Popular drama at its best and a nice wee
holiday for the cast and crew as the lads from the King's Own Fusiliers
head off for a spot of survival training Down Under. For the next three
Antipodean episodes, B Company will cross the barren deserts to a town
called Alice, search through a leech-infested jungle for a crashed
bomber, and rescue local residents from a raging storm. But for the
moment their attention is diverted with the arrival of the new medical
officer, pretty blonde Captain Sadie Williams (Sophie Dix).
* ISLAND RACE (BBC1) -- After five weeks at sea the strain is
beginning to show as John McCarthy and Sandi Toksvig head for the Outer
Hebrides in the third part of this engaging series. After an eventful
journey through the Sound of Mull and past Ardnamurchan Point, the odd
couple reach Eigg in search of a bit of rest and recreation. Then it's
on to Muck aboard a high-speed inflatable boat, piloted by the local
doctor, Chris Tiarks.
0
WEDNESDAY
* THE EUROPEAN MATCH -- LIVE (ITV) -- This is the reason why ITV is
rubbish on a Wednesday evening. They can't commit themselves to any
regular primetime drama slot because they're tied in to live European
football coverage every two weeks. Which is fine (for us blokes) so long
as the Rangers remain in contention but there must surely now be some
dubiety over that after their dismal defeat against Steua Bucharest.
Tonight they face German champions Borussia Dortmund at Ibrox. A scoosh
case for the Teddy Bears.
* MONTANA (BBC1) -- Written for television by Larry McMurtry (Lonesome
Dove and Streets of Laredo) this one-off contemporary Western drama
concerns itself with the march of progress across the vanishing prairie.
Richard Crenna stars as a rancher who, when faced with hard times, is
forced to consider selling out to a voracious power company, apparently
intent on devastating the west. His wife (Gena Rowlands) is equally
determined to preserve her family's traditional way of life. Changing
times bring conflict to a family.
THURSDAY
* FRONTLINE SCOTLAND (BBC1) -- Or Panorama with a kilt. BBC Scotland's
popular, if a tad earnest, current affairs series returns for a new
series and opens with a report from Jane Franchi about child care. Are
The Kids Alright? unearths some disturbing evidence concerning the
standard of care in kids' homes. As underqualified and demoralised staff
come under pressure when forced to cope with an increasing level of
violence among youngsters, the programme suggests that series cracks are
beginning to appear in the system.
* SCOTLAND YARD (ITV) -- There can be few walls left in Britain
without a fly, strategically placed there by a television film crew.
Still, it continues to be a winning (if rather lazy) formula. Carlton's
compulsive documentary series watches the detectives this week. It
follows the months of meticulous planning and dangerous undercover work
which culminated in the arrest (and conviction earlier this month) of
31-year-old James Doyle, who masterminded a string of armed bank and
building society raids in London.
FRIDAY
* CLIVE ANDERSON TALKS BACK (Channel Four) -- Clearly approaching the
end of its shelf-life, this series returns for its tenth season. It's
time someone told C4 that chat shows, even when hosted by someone as
sharp and witty as Anderson, are yesterday's news. The only saving grace
is the choice of guests. Clive has a knack of picking unusual
personalities to poke fun at. Later in the series he'll have John
Redwood (who wouldn't know a funny line if it bit him on the nose). This
week it's American actor and comedian Billy Crystal, attempting --
probably in vain -- to punt his latest movie.
* STAR TREK (BBC2) -- Boldly going where it has gone before, the
latest spin-off from the Starship Enterprise sets sail on a 90-minute
special. For six days in Stardate 43997, Captain Jean-Luc Picard
(Patrick Stewart) was held captive by the evil Borgs who altered his
appearance, warp-factored his mind, and forced him to lead an attack on
the Federation. Now, three years on, Commander Sisko and his son (the
Sisko Kid?), who survived the attack, get transferred to Deep Space Nine
where they come face-to-face with Picard. Sisko blames Picard for his
wife's death. It's times like these that you wish Scottie was still
around to beam you up.
* FILM: U2 RATTLE AND HUM (BBC1) -- A rare treat for rock fans.
Director Phil Joanou mixes live concert footage and the Irish band's
recording sessions in Dublin, Harlem, and Memphis in this 1988
documentary. There's a special appearance by BB King and film of U2's
visit to Graceland. Songs include ''Angel of Harlem'', ''I Still Haven't
Found What I'm Looking For'', and ''Sunday, Bloody Sunday''.
* FILM: MR MAJESTYK -- Based on an Elmore Leonard novella, this
striking thriller stars Charles Bronson as a Vietnam vet, now a melon
farmer, who incurs the wrath of the local Mob when he foils a jailbreak
by one of their soldiers. Though contemporary, it's a classic Western in
the ''A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do'' mould.

THERE'S not a lot to tell about Aristophanes. Plato has him do a turn
during a drinking party in the Symposium, but since that particular ouzo
promotion is supposed to have taken place when the philosopher was a
child, all we really know is that 11 comedies survive, that Aristophanes
died around 385 BC, and that he liked (a wonderful phrase) to divide his
time ''between Aphrodite and Dionysus''.
Classical scholars refer to the Athenian as the Last of the Old Attic
Comedians, as if they meant the Last of the Red-Hot Burlesque Stars.
Aristotle, the classic snob, thought him vulgar, hackneyed and crude.
Then again, anyone who has dipped into the Poetics would take this
almost as a recommendation, given that very little Aristotle said about
the theatre ever made much sense. Nevertheless, we are not talking
high-brow here.
Thus Aristophanes -- The Gods Are Laughing (Channel 4, Tuesday) came
garlanded as the ''specially commissioned centrepiece'' of the C4/BFI
''Blow Your Mind -- See a Show'' exposition. In the event, it turned out
to be a load of old sacrificial bullocks in a week of burnt offerings.
Forget, for a moment, the logic, surpassing Aristotle's, of a TV
station advising its audience to switch off the set and get out to the
theatre. Consider instead the thinking behind the decision to offer
five-minute clips between programmes, for all the world like plugs for
forthcoming attractions, of Shakespeare, Orton, Beckett, Genet and
others too brief to mention. Were these moments, cursory and bereft of
context, supposed to revivify anyone's desire for the real thing?
Granted, there was Steven Berkoff's One Man Show (Sunday), a tour
around the great man's ego by way of his ''philosophy''. But anyone who
has not yet undergone that particular purgative experience (are there
any left?) is unlikely to volunteer for a night in the stalls at this
late date. All that really mattered, behind the window-dressing, was old
Ari.
The Gods Are Laughing was presented as a ''screenplay''. In fact, it
was stage drama with cameras getting in the way. In conventional style
it had the expiring artist remembering his early days (Attenborough's
Chaplin et al), Frances Barber in a tea-towel, Eddie Izzard in a goatee
beard, and some stuff about art's duty to Tell It Like It Is, No Matter
What.
I had wanted a lot to like it and I had wanted to like it a lot. As it
turned out, Izzard's Socrates was as cool and self-regarding as you
might imagine the old snake-oil salesman to have been, and Robert
Glenister as Aristophanes gave quite enough of a clue that the
playwright's Duty to Truth was pretty evenly matched by his duty to his
own career.
Barber, meanwhile, did as much as anyone can with the part of the
sacred courtesan condemned to endure male angst. Some fun was had, too,
with anachronisms and the ways of actors (even unto the inclusion of the
old Kenneth Williams ''Infamy! Infamy!'' bit). But it wasn't enough.
For one thing, the piece told us nothing about satire beyond that it
upsets important people. It flirted with the idea that sometimes when
the truth hurts it hurts flesh as well as feelings, but no blood was
drawn. As comedy, it spoke no truth to power, and its jokes were
probably around when Lysistrata was being told not to screw up her face
like that because it didn't suit her. Infamy indeed.
Somebody certainly had it in for the submariners whose story is being
recounted on Tuesday nights on BBC2. Last week's Nautilus laid the keel
for every claustrophobe's nightmare by describing the horrific and
suicidal early days of undersea war. This week, with splendid narration
from Michael Gambon, we dived into the lunatic world of the men who
steered the miniature subs; chaps (it seemed to require chaps) who set
out to do battle in the knowledge that they would probably return as
flotsam, jetsam, or a bit of both.
Courage is funny stuff, or so it is alleged. Perhaps without meaning
to, this piece invited you to wonder about the difference between
supposedly rational men doing their duty and those, like the Japanese
volunteers who were actually locked into their suicide torpedoes, who
sought doom the way wasps seek jam.
One gnarled survivor of the Imperial Navy did shrinks everywhere a
favour by recalling just how disappointed he had been when his mission
was cancelled. Something about losing face, apparently, as though the
loss of arms, legs, and brainwashed head was a bagatelle.
A bagatelle (this is known as a link) but a good one was How To Be a
Little S*d (BBC1, Tuesday), a kind of Look Who's Talking with genuine
projectile vomiting. Given Rik Mayall as the voice of baby, this
gruesome verisimilitude was not to be wondered at, but the mixture of
animation and live action worked well, the jokes were good, and the
little s*d's parents managed to look long-suffering in the space of just
10 minutes. If Mayall can stand the typecasting, so can I.
Having missed the BBC's Gamekeeper series, it seems perverse now to
praise Firing Range, made by Scottish Television Enterprises for C4's
Cutting Edge strand (Monday). Nevertheless, this was an acute study of
the way large chunks of Scotland are ''conserved'', ''held in trust'',
and otherwise mummified for private profit and private pleasure.
The trouble with Invercauld, an estate owned by the Farquharson family
near Balmoral, was that profit wasn't bleeding nearly fast enough from
the birdies and the beasties to keep the place going. Thus the owners
had handed the place over to a trust, and the trust in turn had passed
the parcel to factors and agents, generally (or so it seemed) ineffably
pompous army types whose ideas of man management seemed to consist of
balance-sheet babble and the issuing of verbal warnings to truculent
keepers.
It was a sad piece, in its way, less a memorial to a passing way of
life than an elegy for the country people whose loyalty to the big
houses has rarely, if ever, been repaid. No points were pressed, since
they spoke graphically for themselves, but while admiring the scenery
and the skill that went into the filming of stalkers at work, you could
sit and listen to your blood boil.
In Off Your Trolley (BBC2, Wednesday) Loyd Grossman went nasal over
ready-made supermarket meals. Chicken Kiev was first, apparently, a
bland dish oozing something greasy that is, for inexplicable reasons,
ubiquitous. Never were presenter and subject better matched.

Sir Rudolf Peierls, physicist, born Berlin June 5, 1907, died
September 19, 1995
SIR Rudolf Peierls, whose work led to the development of the first
atomic bomb in 1945, has died in Oxford aged 88. No cause of death was
given.
In 1940, German-born Peierls and Austrian-born Otto Frisch produced
the first practical blueprint for the atomic bomb. Up to then it had
been thought that it would be impossible to make one because of the
amount of uranium needed. But they showed it could be done by using pure
uranium-235 and they stressed it was vital to beat wartime Nazi Germany
to its development.
The memorandum set in motion the British atomic effort and provided
the vital stimulus for America's Manhattan Project that led to the
explosion of the first atomic bomb at Alamagordo, New Mexico, in July
1945.
In 1944, Peierls went as senior resident British scientist to Los
Alamos, the laboratory establishment in New Mexico set up to design and
manufacture the bombs dropped on Japan.The Hiroshima bomb used
uranium-235, as Peierls and Frisch had suggested.
Hailed as one of the founding fathers of the nuclear age, Peierls
became president of the Atomic Scientists' Association that campaigned
for international control of nuclear weapons.
Peierls, who came to Britainin 1932, was Professor of Mathematical
Physics at Birmingham University from 1937 to 1963, when he went to
Oxford University as Wykeham Professor of Physics. He was knighted in
1968 and retired in 1974. He and his wife, who died in 1986, are
survived by their four children.

ONE of the consultants who wrote a report about the new #38m Edinburgh
International Conference Centre (EICC), which is the subject of a
political row, has insisted it was not in any way critical.
Yesterday's publication of the letter was part of a damage limitation
exercise by the local enterprise company Lothian and Edinburgh
Enterprise Ltd (Leel) which had commissioned the feasibility study on
behalf of ScottishPower.
A Scottish Television report claimed that the study -- the contents of
which have not been made public -- was critical of the size of the space
available for exhibitions at the new centre.
Scottish TV claimed the study said a much larger area was needed if
the centre was to remain competitive.
However, Mr Eric Rymer, author of the relevant part of the report,
said in a letter to the enterprise company that he was ''appalled and
amazed'' at the way it had been presented.
His letter continues: ''For the record, let me say that the results of
the study were in no way critical of the EICC.
''It is quite clear that the EICC is fit for its purpose as was ably
demonstrated by the Kwik Fit event on Sunday and by the 100 bookings
already secured.''
The study looked at the technical feasibility of using an adjacent
building to the EICC owned by ScottishPower as an associated exhibition
centre.
If it were decided to go ahead with the scheme it would enhance what
the centre could offer but, Mr Rymer said, that in no way denigrated
existing facilities.
The enterprise company's chief executive Dr Des Bonnar refused to
release the full report yesterday, claiming commercial confidentiality.
He said the TV programme had caused ''some confusion and a lot of
anger''.
The managers of the centre stressed that the building was not designed
as a venue for larger trade shows and exhibitions. Bookings up to the
year 2005 had confirmed its long-term success.
Last night, Ms Daphne Sleigh, leader of Edinburgh district's Tories,
said she had written to Dr Bonnar asking him for a copy of the study.

AROMATHERAPY has become a catch-all therapy often criticised by
traditional medicine. A growing number of beauty products now sell
themselves with the aromatherapy tag. Aromatherapists, however, feel
that their profession is being devalued and downgraded.
''One of the most common ritual uses of odour across cultures is to
combat illness,'' write the authors of Aroma: The Cultural History of
Smell (Routledge, #12.99). ''This use of odour is typically based on a
simple proposition: that harmful odours produce disease and that
healthful odours will drive out these harmful odours and thereby cure
the patient.'' Aromatherapy does not quite work like that but smell has
potent powers that has founded fortunes and created whole industries.
Essential oils used in aromatherapy are safe as long as they are well
diluted. It's important that people who use them should know what
they're doing, and should consult a therapist or, at least, read a book
on the subject. Certain of the oils are extremely potent and undiluted
should never be applied directly to the skin.
Health and beauty products, cosmetics and perfume have leapt on to the
natural-smell bandwagon with scents based on plants -- smells like
new-mown meadows and fresh melon are common in perfumes and aftershave.
Other products promise beneficial effects but contain essential oil in
such small doses that they could not possibly be beneficial.
However, smell is one of the most basic, primal senses and
aromatherapy can be used to successfully remedy a host of ailments from
migraines to colic.
Recently there has been cause for concern and a call for essential
oils to be available only by prescription. Essential oil manufacturers
and distributors have been appalled at the idea although many
aromatherapists agree that there should be restrictions on buying the
oils.
Improper and inexpert use of essential oils, even by trained
therapists, can have devastating consequences. Some oils have side
effects that could be problematic to pregnant women and epileptics
although these tend to be the more obscure aromatherapy oils that are
not generally available to the public. On your first visit for an
aromatherapy massage the therapist should sit you down and spend at
least 15 minutes going into your medical background.
Daniele Ryman, who has worked with aromatherapy oils for more than 25
years, says: ''Unfortunately, there is not enough knowledge about
aromatherapy. People want to use the world 'aromatherapy' now because
it's a way of selling.''
The Aromatherapy Trades Council (ATC) is well aware of the situation
and will not sanction products that have ''aromatherapy'' stamped on
them but are in no way therapeutic.

The 'all brawn no brain' image of bodybuilders is a myth, finds Ann
Donald as she muscles in on a pilloried sport which boasts a new breed
of female participants
FROM the upper floor of Marco's Leisure Centre, Glasgow, two disparate
rhythms are pumping and clunking out respectively. The former is an
up-tempo techno beat emanating from a clutch of TV screens attached to
the walls and seemingly permanently tuned to MTV.
The source of the latter -- a dull, heavy clunking noise -- is
glaringly obvious. A man -- and let's not be polite about this -- built
like a brick shithouse, is shifting 18 stones of weight at four-second
intervals on an exercise machine that would look more at home in a
Spanish Inquisition torture chamber.
As the full weight is felt upon a back as broad as Europe, the veins
that snake around his massive arms inflate gently. The man's face
flushes crimson as blood seeps up through his Tyson-like neck, past the
grimacing mouth now emitting a strangled groan associated with
childbirth, before swiftly bypassing the round designer glasses and
finally diffusing when it reaches an apex of cropped hair at the
forehead.
The 27-year-old man is Davie Sharp, an award-winning competitive
bodybuilder whose 113lb of unadulterated muscle and 52-inch chest can be
attributed to one of the few sports that Scotland regularly excels in
when pitted against the rest of the UK -- bodybuilding.
It is also one of the most universally derided of sports. Just look at
its most public ambassadors -- Lou ''The Incredible Hulk'' Grant and
Arnold Schwarzenegger -- not really rocket scientist material are they?
The public consensus is rooted in a deep-seated belief of ''all brawn --
no brain''.
After all, why would anyone with half a brain cell dedicate a major
part of their life among an iron jungle of dumbbells, barbells, and
racks of cast-iron weights to build bulging muscles out of all
proportion?
Then there's the eternal suspicion that all that testosterone can't be
natural. They must all be on anabolic steroids -- especially those
masculine women. And to cap it all they shave off all body hair, lather
on a sticky mixture of fake tan and baby oil, don skimpy briefs or
bikini and flex bodyparts in an orgy of narcissism.
Certainly, judging by the bodybuilders this journalist spoke to, these
myths can be consigned to a tiny minority. Malcolm Clark, the Scottish
representative of the National Amateur Body Building Association and
Evelyn Lees, a former Miss Britain Figure and NABBA judge, both believe
that the sport once condemned as the exclusive terrain of the
monosyllabic male Neanderthal has changed.
Both cite positive trends such as the emergence of a new breed of
female bodybuilders who favour the athletic look as opposed to the
pumped muscular look of the 80s. Nutrition is now viewed as being on par
with actual training. Also, more professionals are opting for
bodybuilding as a stress buster and aerobics instructors are realising
the benefits for teenage girls of ''dynamic resistance'' -- ie weights
and aerobics as a means of counteracting osteoporosis in later life.
Clark, a former Mr Universe contestant whose impressively fit
58-year-old physique is down to a workout five times each week, is keen
to play down the macho side of bodybuilding but still acknowledges the
core of hard men that still exist, especially in Scotland.
''The scene up here has always been very healthy,'' he says, ''both
the thousands who workout at home and those who go in for competitive
bodybuilding.'' In his experience the nucleus of musclemen are
concentrated in areas like Fife and Ayrshire . . . ''because the steel
mills and heavy industry have all but gone in these areas, there is very
high male unemployment and the only way to keep themselves occupied and
get rid of the aggression is to go down to the gym.''
As well as being an antidote to aggression and stress, Clark enthuses
about another very positive spin-off -- confidence-building. Referring
to the original Charles Atlas Mr Universe adverts of the 40s that honed
in on the wimp who was sick of getting sand kicked in his face, Clark
says: ''That's really not so far removed from the truth you know.''
Stressing this inner benefit that he feels is often overlooked by a
public too blinkered by the superficial or narcissism side of the sport,
Clark continues: ''Because, as well as giving you a tremendous sense of
well-being, there is that inner knowledge that you can walk into any
room of people and not feel intimidated.''
For Evelyn Lees, 35, a fitness instructor and NABBA judge, the impetus
behind her involvement in bodybuilding stems from a very practical
consideration. ''I basically used my second pregnancy as a licence to
eat,'' she laughs. ''I decided to get into shape and lose this four
stones of weight.''
After entering her first show two years later in 1987 and winning, she
was hooked and so the competing snowballed with Lees scooping up most of
the Scottish prizes before culminating in the award Miss Britain Figure
1990 and 1992. ''It's a way of life now,'' she adds, before revealing
that she gave birth to her third child the day after holding a fitness
class.
Over the past 10 years Lees has observed definite shifts in the female
bodybuilding world, notably in the decline of the physique category.
''In the past women coming through were very, very muscular and were
more or less judged on par with men,'' she says. ''However, that's
abated and even the judging criteria now says that women must not render
themselves asexual.''
The figure section, where the emphasis is on the trained, lean, and
athletic look rather than muscular, has also been reappraised and is now
taken more seriously, says Lees. ''It takes the same amount of training,
but in the past the figure was viewed as a bit of a sideshow, whereas
now the girls are very highly trained and the standard gets higher each
year.''
Other changes include the debunking of the ''all brawn -- no brain''
cliche. As Lees points out, the sport makes short shrift of those
uneducated bodybuilders who believe it's all a matter of shifting the
500lb barbells and hey presto Popeye mucles.
''The days of wandering blindly into it are long gone,'' she says.
''Standards are so high that it's almost a science now because you have
to have an amazing knowledge of nutrition, physiology, and biology. You
can do all the training in the world but get the diet wrong and you'll
blow it,'' she warns. ''The ones who are doing well out there are
certainly not idiots.''
As for the sticky topic of steroids or ''gear'' -- 99% of bodybuilders
clam up immediately denying knowledge or use. For Clark, the official
NABBA line reiterates his personal view. ''I abhor them,'' though he
adds realistically: ''You won't be able to stamp them out unless you
develop a very good and efficient way of testing.''
According to Lees, steroids are overrated -- ''People imagine that you
take a handful of steroids and immediately you become a world-class
bodybuilder. It's not the case. It's the training and diet that make
you, not the steroids.''
For aspiring professional bodybuilder Davie Sharp then, it looks as if
his high carbohydrate/high protein #20 daily diet plus the two hours he
spends sweating it out training six days per week, will have to suffice
if he is to be a prospective Mr Universe candidate.

When Latter-Day Saints go marching in: ALISON KERR views the receiving
end of the doorstep evangelist
JAMES Bond-style tactics were employed for Sunday's edition of the BBC
religious programme Everyman. With a brief of focusing on the phenomenon
of the ''doorstep evangelist'' -- in this case, the doorstep Mormon --
the only way producer Ben Fox could see of documenting the genuine
reaction of doorstepees was to plant a hidden camera on one of their
callers.
The responses -- which ranged from in-yer-face door slamming to
genuine curiosity -- were all recorded by a tiny camera embedded in the
bridge of specially made spectacles worn by one of each of the pairs of
Mormons doing their daily rounds.
The film starts where the Mormon missionary starts: at the Missionary
Training Centre in London, where new recruits undergo 12 days of
rigorous instruction on how to handle doorstep visits, and how to
recognise and seize the moment when a potential Mormon becomes ripe for
conversion. The apprentice missionaries come from all over Britain and
Europe: in the film, there's a Norwegian, a Spaniard, a Ukrainian, and a
Glaswegian, Sister Glasswell.
Since the film was made, 28-year-old Sister Glasswell (her Christian
name is not used while she's on her mission) has embarked on the second
phase of her mission: she's been despatched to the Leeds area, where she
works with her American companion, Sister Hansen.
Originally from East Kilbride, Sister Glasswell is atypical as far as
her entry to the religion is concerned. Unlike some of the other
participants in the programme, she was not unhappy; not searching for an
aim in her life; not seeking a structure because of a flawed family
background. She was a practising Catholic, studying zoology at Glasgow
University when she first encountered the Mormons at her sister's house
in Oban.
Two years later, they came back and she invited them in out of
curiosity. ''They explained things that Catholicism had left
unexplained,'' she says. Both she and her sister ''took the
discussions'' (a series of conversations during which the missionaries
talk about the Bible and the Book of Mormon), and both decided to be
baptised as Mormons.
Sister Glasswell was, she admits, a bit reticent. ''The missionaries
say you have to wait for a sign from the Holy Ghost: you pray to find
out if what they've said is true.'' She believed it was, and joined the
Church of Latter Day Saints, despite initial opposition from her
parents.
Since graduating in 1989, Sister Glasswell has completed a masters and
worked in Australia.  A couple of years ago she decided to serve the
Church by becoming a missionary, and she began to save the money she
would require to support her time working as a Mormon.
The mission lasts two years, after which she will return to Scotland,
and -- hopefully -- find a job. ''But,'' she says, ''you don't have to
be on a mission to spread the Gospel. I'll keep using the skills I've
learned as a missionary.''

A GOVERNMENT inspection of the top public school at the centre of
bullying allegations will begin in October.
A team of education inspectors is expected to set up a base in Fettes
College in Edinburgh next month for a study lasting several weeks.
The college, which says it would welcome such an inspection every
year, was last subject to a full study 14 years ago. The preliminary
findings are expected in November.
The team will look at every aspect of the school, including boarding
arrangements for boarders, learning, and management systems.
Headmaster Malcolm Thyne has sent questionnaires to the parents of the
school's 485 pupils. These will also be presented to the inspectors.
Commenting on the inspection, he said: ''I am optimistic that it will
recognise major strengths in areas of excellence in the education at
Fettes, and that the inspection will assist us in identifying areas
where further improvements can be made.''
Mr Thyne told The Herald earlier this year that the school had been
subject to an ''orchestrated vendetta'' by a small group of parents over
the bullying allegations and said the school had nothing to hide.

A CATHOLIC priest now serving a four-year sentence for sexually
abusing youngsters was jailed yesterday for a further three years.
Belfast Crown Court heard that when finally released in Easter 1997,
Brendan Smyth, 68, will face 30 sex charges in the Irish Republic.
The court was told that Smyth would be continuing danger to children.
Smyth pleaded guilty to 26 charges of indecently assaulting nine girls
and four boys from September 1969 to October 1988. Some of his victims
are now in their thirties with families of their own.
Two of his victims were so disturbed by the abuse that they attempted
suicide.
In two of the cases, children turned to the authorities for help but
those in power chose to ignore them, Judge Mr Justice Campbell said.
''While that is not only a terrible thing, it also did you a
disservice,'' the judge told Smyth.
Although Smyth pleaded guilty to 26 new charges of indecent assault,
Crown lawyer John Creaney emphasised that the charges were only specimen
counts reflecting a catalogue of assaults.
He said the children were aged 10 or 11, although in one case the
abuses continued until the victim was aged 18 -- just before she
married.
Smyth found many of his victims in Catholic childrens' homes in
Belfast, County Down, and Enniskillen.
Defence lawyer Jim Lavery, QC, claimed that, as a ''life-long fixated
and compulsive paedophiliac'', the priest could not help himself.
Later, the Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor, Dr Patrick Walsh, said
Smyth had betrayed his ''sacred trust''.

<HEADLINE>Why Sting had to quit career in taxes. Star's 'horror' of accounts</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976240887</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MULTI-MILLIONAIRE pop superstar Sting reduced a court to laughter
yesterday when he revealed how his incompetence cut short his career as
a taxman.
He said that a ''horror'' of documents full of figures did not go down
well in an Inland Revenue world full of complex calculations. In the
end, he had no option but to depart.
The insight into his pre-fame days came as he continued to give
evidence for the second day against his former accountant Keith Moore,
accused of stealing #6m from him.
He was being asked a series of questions by 51-year-old Moore's
barrister, Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, about statements sent to him by his
bank, Coutts &amp; Company.
The statements detailed transactions on one of his accounts, from
which the prosecution claims that Mr Moore, Sting's financial adviser,
illegally transferred #4.8m to a Bank of Scotland account over which he
had sole control.
Southwark Crown Court has been told that Mr Moore, of Alder Lodge,
Stevenage Road, south-west London, who denies 15 sample counts of theft,
lost most of the money in a series of speculative ventures.
Sting said that although he received regular statements from Coutts,
long tours abroad meant he was often presented with a bundle of them at
once.
He explained he did his best to look through them but was simply ''not
qualified'' to understand them properly.
Mr Purnell put it to him: ''They are not in coded terms. You don't
need undercover agents, hieroglyphics, to get to them.'' Sting agreed
but said his understanding of his highly complex business affairs was
derived from a series of ''copious and verbose'' letters Mr Moore sent
to him.
Mr Purnell: ''Is there anything copious or obscure about the Coutts
statements?''
Sting: ''I can understand them now.''
Mr Purnell: ''You are not an innocent abroad. Going back to your
youth, you took an A-level in economics. . . . You also had an unhappy
period working for the Inland Revenue and you can't have somebody at the
Inland Revenue who is horrified by financial documents.''
To laughter, Sting replied: ''I am afraid that is really why I was
forced to leave the Inland Revenue.''
Mr Purnell said Mr Moore secured an agreement with the Inland Revenue
that the star should not be taxed on his foreign earnings. It saved him
#4.8m on #11.6m of income between 1986 and 1991.
Mr Purnell claimed that, with Sting's knowledge and approval, the
money was transferred to bank accounts controlled by Mr Moore.
''Are you saying that I agreed that all the money saved from the
Inland Revenue would go to an account controlled by Mr Moore? . . . I
don't think I did,'' Sting said.
The court heard how the star had lost #200,000 investing in
Kaleidoscope Cameras, a company seeking to develop a remote-control,
360[DEG] swivel camera head.
''I lost interest for practical reasons because the idea was very
difficult to copyright,'' said Sting.
''The one thing I'm truly interested in investing in is houses. I live
all over the world. I have a large family. I like to stay in houses
sometimes, rather than hotel rooms.''
The court also heard that the star had set up a record company in New
York and considered, but rejected, investing in a Soho restaurant, the
Hard Rock Cafe, and a company manufacturing disposable syringes.
The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.

COLLEAGUES of a police officer found to have attacked an Asian man are
to take up his case against suspension from duty.
Mr Tom Rowatt, secretary of Strathclyde Police Federation, said
yesterday that he was concerned at the manner in which Constable Graham
McKee had been treated.
Sheriff George Evans had ruled on Thursday that Mr McKee had assaulted
Aamer Anwar four years ago in Glasgow's West End. The sheriff in his
judgment said the officer had slammed Mr Anwar's face down on a concrete
path twice, breaking his teeth. Mr Anwar was awarded #4200 in
compensation at the end of his civil action.
However, Mr Rowatt said yesterday: ''This matter was fully
investigated some four years ago and the regional procurator fiscal at
Glasgow directed that no proceedings should be taken against him.''
The officer had the total support of the Strathclyde branch of the
Scottish Police Federation, said Mr Rowatt.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton dons dark glasses with actor James Belushi,
left, and Vice President Al Gore during a late stop at the famous Sunset
Strip Club, the House of Blues, in Hollywood.
Belushi's late brother John played one of the Blues Brothers with Dan
Ackroyd.
The ''gig'' came after a day of activities in California including a
live call-in radio appearance with programme host Larry King and a
celebrity-studded fund-raising dinner.
Earlier, the president said he would delay formally declaring his
candidacy for a second term as long as possible and said he hoped
America would be blind to Colin Powell's race if he seeks the White
House.
Clinton, hoping to complete all his fund-raising needs before the 1996
election year begins, ended a four-state drive that raised $5m for his
re-election coffers.
During a question and answer session on radio, Clinton said he wanted
to get his fund-raising needs ''out of the way so I could spend as much
time as possible trying to be president next year and defer the campaign
as much as possible.'''
Clinton told Larry King that ''everyone knows I intend to run again''
but that he ''would like to put it off as long as possible because
there's so much work to be done.''--Reuter.

Washington
THERE is a new candidate for president. Steven Forbes, owner of the
eponymous magazine founded by his grandfather, announced today he is
running for the Republican nomination.
Though his chances cannot be rated highly, there is an argument that
the nation wants an outsider. Ross Perot, a self-made billionaire, won
19% of the vote as an independent in 1992, and General Colin Powell
might well take the plunge into politics next month.
Forbes, unlike Perot or Powell, has no personal qualifications beyond
his wealth. His grandfather, Albert, who was born near Aberdeen (near
Cruden, birthplace of Rupert Murdoch's grandfather), emigrated to
America 80 years ago and did well in publishing.
His son, Malcolm, was a flamboyant media tycoon, motor-cyclist,
balloonist, and self-promoter, who built Forbes Magazine into one of the
country's main business publications. He celebrated his 70th birthday
with a huge bash in Morocco, to which he invited the glitterati from
across the globe, and then died abruptly.
Steven inherited the magazine and the fortune, to neither of which has
he much contributed. He now offers himself to the nation as ''someone
who can unlock the stranglehold that the political class has on American
life; an outsider who knows, as I do, the promise of the new economy''.
He asserts that ''government is dragging down all Americans'' and that
the American people demand ''an end to politics-as-usual''. He compared
himself to John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.
He took a jab at other Republican candidates, whom he accused of a
''narrow, cramped, and constricted'' view of America, and who believe
''that the wagon is heavy and crowded and now is the time to start
throwing people off''. This is the mantra of Senator Phil Gramm and has
become official Republican philosophy.
He says he believes in ''the time-honoured American values of hope,
opportunity, family, faith, and community'' but does not mention
motherhood or apple pie.
Like many rich people, he wants to cut taxes, suggesting a maximum of
17%, but only for income over $36,000 a year. He said that the cut would
set off a huge economic boom that would so raise national prosperity
that government revenues would actually increase.
He is also going to restore the gold standard, and cut interest rates
to 4[1/2]%. ''Imagine what it would be like to wake up tomorrow morning
with a 17% flat tax that exempted the first $36,000 of income and a
fixed long-term mortgage of 4[1/2]%''.

ONLY four months after he left his 14-year stint in the Elysee,
Francois Mitterrand is again very present in the minds of the nation.
Not politically, although one imagines him deriving much malicious
pleasure from the directionless nature of so much Chirac government
policy, but philosophically.
The 79-year-old former president and his wife of 50 years, Daniele,
are discussing and preparing their own burial, and the country is
fascinated.
For the symbolic sum of one franc, the couple have bought a
10-square-metre patch of land on a hillside near their childhood homes
in central France. The hill on which they want to be buried is called
Mont Beuvray, and was once the site of the settlement of Bibracte where
the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix rallied the tribes of ancient Gaul in
revolt against Caesar.
For the former president's many enemies, this unusual, albeit
picturesque place for a funeral, is merely proof of Mitterrand
megalomania. What is not fitting, they have said, is that the man who
littered Paris with so many grandiose architectural projects, from the
Bastille Opera to the Louvre pyramid, should equate himself with a
history book hero like Vercingetorix.
How typical, they say, that a politician who struggled all his life to
make a mark on the history of his century should inflict us with a
high-profile grave and turn both himself and his wife, post-mortem, into
a tourist attraction.
Embarrassed by early reports of the hillside plot, the Mitterrands at
first hotly denied the whole affair. In a moment of fatigue and
impatience, Mitterrand even suggested to his wife that they forget the
mountain and settle for quiet burials at sea.
The idea, it now transpires, was not that of the former president but
of his wife, who had not been hankering for posthumous grandeur, but
merely seeking a quiet place which had associations with both their
early lives.
One reason she is attached to Mont Beuvray, she said last week, is
because it affords a view over the school where her father, a teacher,
used to work.
Both the Mitterrands are in a fragile state of health: she had open
heart surgery in 1994 and he, over the past two years, has undergone two
operations and chemotherapy for prostate cancer.
He has been facing the prospect of imminent death with all the
sceptical intellectual curiosity that has marked his long life in
politics.
Mitterrand has written a preface to a recently published book,
entitled Intimate Death, by psycho-analyst Marie de Hennezel, who works
in a unit for the terminally ill in a Paris hospital.
While loving to command, Mitterrand knows the limits of his own
knowledge and has always attracted and befriended advisers on all sorts
of serious matters. Now, it transpires, he has an adviser on the
infinitely sensitive subject of death.
De Hennezel met Mitterrand in 1986, when he and his Health Minister,
Georgina Dufoix, visited her hospital unit.
Deeply impressed by the patients to whom he was introduced and by the
work of the staff, who made no bones about expressing grievances
concerning insufficient funds and absence of recognition within the
French health service, the president used that visit as material for his
preface to de Hennezel's book about her work.
The modern world, he writes, unlike earlier civilisations which looked
death in the face and gave it significance, turns away from a subject of
which it is terrified.
De Hennezel, it was revealed last week, has kept in close contact with
Mitterrand since their first meeting 10 years ago. She has paid numerous
visits to the Elysee and a recurrent subject of conversation has, not
surprisingly, been death.
At one lunch, Mitterrand said to her: ''Each of us is in a plane which
one day will crash into a mountain. Most people forget the fact. I think
of it every day, but perhaps because I'm beginning to see the mountain
through the window.''
After his first operation for cancer in the summer of 1993, Mitterrand
called de Hennezel to his bedside in the Elysee. He announced solemnly:
''The process is under way. I am not afraid of death, but I love
living.''

Charleston, South Carolina
INSTEAD of sending a drug offender to prison, a judge took off his
belt and had the 18-year-old's grandmother give him a whipping.
''I think he'll kind of remember what to do on probation,'' circuit
judge Frank Eppes said today, a day after he imposed the sentence.
Youth advocates chastised the 72-year-old judge for teaching that
violence is the answer, but some who are fighting for tougher punishment
for criminals supported his decision.
''I think the country is open to any innovative approach to resolving
the juvenile crime problem,'' said Jim Grego, a founder of Citizens
Against Violent Crime.
Before Jamel Washington pleaded guilty yesterday to possession of
crack cocaine, he said he would fail a drug test because he had smoked
marijuana.
''I said, 'Grandmama, don't you think he needs a whipping?''' Eppes
recalled. ''She said he needed one and ought to have a whipping.''
Eppes supplied the belt and he, Washington, the grandmother whose name
was not available, and a courtroom deputy then went into the judge's
office.
Ten to 12 loud smacks could be heard, said Bruce Durant, a prosecutor
in the courtroom. Eppes said there were no more than five strokes.
When they returned, Washington appeared sheepish and his grandmother
looked pleased, Durant said. Washington could not be located for comment
today.
''You need discipline, in the home and in the schools,'' said Eppes, a
retired judge from Greenville, on special assignment in Charleston.
Beatings ''did me some good when I was growing up . . . I got several
when I needed them''.
Corporal punishment is more likely to teach violence rather than right
from wrong, said Arlene Andrews, a board member of the South Carolina
Alliance for Children.
''If you whip the child, the child may whip you, or whip someone
else,'' said Andrews, who also teaches social work at the University of
South Carolina.
''It can cause resentment, anger, sullen behaviour and lead to the
very negative things you're trying to prevent.''

Larnaca
THREE British soldiers charged with kidnapping and killing a young
Danish tour guide in Cyprus were unlawfully arrested by police who then
lied to try to justify their actions, the men's lawyers claimed today
Police said the soldiers were arrested at a roadblock on the night of
September 12 last year after they refused to produce their identity
cards.
But defence lawyers told Larnaca Assize Court today that the men were
arrested at gunpoint as soon as their car was stopped and were not given
the chance to produce their papers.
Privates Justin Fowler, 26, of Falmouth; Alan Ford, 27, of Birmingham,
and Jeff Parnell, 23, from Oldbury have pleaded not guilty to
kidnapping, manslaughter and conspiracy to rape 23-year-old Louise
Jensen, whose naked and battered body was found in a shallow grave near
Ayia Napa two days after she was seized.
The soldiers, who served at a British military base near Ayia Napa,
were arrested some 90 minutes after her boyfriend told police she had
been snatched.
The court ruled yesterday that the defence can raise its arguments
against the police in three separate ''trials within the main trial''.
Today the lawyers reiterated that the men were not read their rights
and that their car, its contents and personal belongings were illegally
impounded by the police.
''It is our position that the exhibits should be excluded,'' Christos
Pourgourides told the court.
''They are the result of an illegal and unconstitutional arrest,
detaining and search.''
The allegations could lead to the rejection of vital prosecution
evidence gathered by police following the arrest.
This includes a bloodstained shovel allegedly used to batter the
woman, bloody palm prints on the seats of the car and bloodstains on the
men's clothes.
Pourgourides said after today's session that the prosecution's case
against his clients would be ''very weak'' if the evidence was excluded.
The hearing resumes next Friday.--AP.

THE crew of the cross-Channel ferry Stena Challenger, which ran
aground in stormy weather off the coast of France on Tuesday, was placed
on standby last night to go back into service.
Stena Sealink, owners of the ferry, hope that, within the next 48
hours, the vessel will be given the all-clear and allowed to resume
sailings on the Dover-Calais route.
It is still in dry dock in the French port of Dunkirk, where its hull
is being fully inspected for signs of major damage after it became
beached for almost 24 hours with 250 people on board.
However, the company is confident that the inspection will confirm the
findings of divers on Thursday -- who found nothing more than
superficial scratches -- and that it will be given a clean bill of
health.
Stena spokesman Jim Hanna said: ''The expectation is that there is no
damage to the hull.
''That being the case, we are preparing to put the ship back into
service at the first available time.
''That could be some point over the weekend but, at this stage, we
cannot be specific as to exactly when.''
When the 18,500-tonne ship does put back to sea it will have a new
master at the helm.
The company has decided to give the master of the Stena Challenger
temporary compassionate leave after what it said had been a ''stressful
period'' for him.
It was denied he had been suspended. Ms Sue Kirk, the company's public
relations manager, said the captain, who is not being named, was being
given leave to allow him to be available to help with the inquiry into
the incident.
She said: ''It has been a stressful period for him and he will
probably be replaced on compassionate grounds and will not complete his
week on.''
It is still not yet known how the ship became stranded as it waited to
enter Calais in force eight winds, although human error, unlike the
weather conditions and mechanical failure, has not been ruled out.

TONY Blair met Richard Branson yesterday. The Labour leader shook
hands with the millionaire entrepreneur, toured a Virgin Atlantic jet,
and basked in the high-profile attention lavished on him by the man who
was once a hero of the Thatcher revolution.
For New Labour the encounter was a well-timed indication of the
party's growing acceptability in business circles and of Mr Blair's
appeal to the City as a potentially trustworthy manager of the economy.
Mr Branson, who in the 1980s was asked by Mrs Thatcher to help clean
up the streets of Britain, invited Mr Blair to Virgin headquarters to
discuss deregulation and other issues.
Yesterday, Mr Branson declined to say who he would vote for at the
next election but appeared to give Mr Blair his tacit endorsement by
declaring: ''I think Mr Blair is very witty and if there were 10 of him
in the Cabinet the business community would be quite reassured.''
Earlier, the Labour leader met with a group of English businessmen on
the latest leg of his national campaign to convince business and
industry of Labour's economic competence.
With Mr Branson, he toured the South Terminal at Gatwick airport,
where they shook hands with waiting passengers. Mr Branson was cheered
as he shouted: ''Who's flying Virgin then?''
However, he remained politically neutral and insisted he was prepared
to meet all party leaders: ''I have always stayed out of party politics
and we are looking to talk to all politicians because there are issues
we feel strongly about.''
He said he would consider going public on his voting intentions before
the next election.
Mr Blair told the breakfast seminar, attended by several hundred
business people, that the Tories could no longer claim to be the party
of business after 16 years of economic mismanagement.
Figures yesterday show a widening UK trade gap with non-EU countries,
which Mr Blair said showed a ''fundamental weakness'' in the economy.
''Unless we adopt long-term policies to increase the strength of the
British economy, we will continue to lag behind our competitors and find
ourselves in perpetual danger of having periods of short-term boom
followed by recession,'' he added.
Meanwhile, Labour yesterday unveiled its carrot and stick plan to
shake up town halls with cash bonuses to encourage higher standards and
''hit squads'' to tackle badly-run councils.
The radical plans -- outlined in Labour's policy document Renewing
Democracy, Rebuilding Communities -- included the option of introducing
American-style directly elected mayors.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson said the aim was to
modernise local authorities, raise standards, and return power to
councillors instead of ''faceless bureaucrats''.
He pledged prompt, efficient action when councils failed to meet
acceptable targets and vowed to increase the involvement of local people
in the affairs of their council.
Environment Secretary John Gummer immediately attacked Labour's plans
to abolish compulsory competitive tendering, against which many unions
have campaigned.
Mr Gummer said: ''Instead of standing up for consumers, Frank Dobson
has surrendered to union pressure. When the unions say 'jump', Frank
Dobson jumps and the rest of us are expected to pay.''
Association of Metropolitan Authorities' chairman, Sir Jeremy Beecham,
welcomed Labour's report overall but said: ''We don't feel it's an
appropriate model for this country. You look at American local
government and it's hardly the epitomy of civic probity.''

Jane Austen wanted her women to be morally autonomous human beings and
to know their own hearts. Carol Clewlow argues that this was not
unambitious for a novelist more often seen asa genteel spinster
IN the end, I think it was that damn drawing that did it for Jane
Austen. The original, done by her sister Cassandra, is in the National
Portrait Gallery in London, all moon face and piercing black eyes
beneath the bonnet and kiss curls.
But, as Jane's reputation grew over the years, so too did the editions
of her work, and so too did the poetic licence of the artists called on
the reproduce the picture.
They added frills to the bonnet and around the neck, puff sleeves to
the dress. They slimmed down the face and flattened it out, turning it,
in the end, into their own vision of her: Jane the genteel spinster
novelist.
But this is the woman who wrote of Maria Bertram awaiting her marriage
in Mansfield Park: ''In all the important preparations of the mind she
was complete; being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home,
restraint, and tranquillity; by the misery of disappointed affection,
and contempt of the man she was to marry.''
The words are so harsh you almost run from them. They fall like a dead
hand on your heart.
Can this be the genteel spinster novelist of that anodyne picture, you
ask, scribbing away in the rectory, limited by her own life and milieu?
Or are we talking about something else here, something infinitely deep
and wider and darker, a witch with an inky satirical finger poking
firmly right down into the soul?
In essence, that's been the debate since the beginning. And, since the
beginning, Jane has had her supporters and detractors.
Lord David Cecil was a fan. Charlotte Bronte wasn't. Mark Twain could
be said to be most affected claiming she inspired in him ''animal
repugnance''. Henry James insulted her most of all though, calling her
writing ''instinctive and charming'' and suggesting that, for serious
greatness, the reader look elsewhere.
Among the great Jane Austen myths is that she lived locked away from
the real world in the bosom of a family as boring and parochial as
herself. The reality was somewhat different.
Her mother was related both to the Duke of Chandos and a Master of
Balliol, while an aunt was the celebrated Mrs Leigh Perrot, whose false
imprisonment for petty theft created a sensation. A cousin, the Comtesse
de Feuillide fled the French Revolution after losing her husband to the
guillotine, consoling herself on her arrival in England by marrying
Jane's brother Henry, himself a colourful character, who had tried a
career in both the military and the priesthood before settling into
banking where he thereafter went bankrupt. Add to this another brother
who became a friend of Nelson's and a third who married the daughter of
the Attorney-General of Bermuda and it's clear that what we do not have
here is the average Hampshire family.
Then there's the vision of Jane the hermit, the dour unsociable
blue-stocking who never went out. Wrong again.
What letters remain (Cassandra destroyed most after Jane's death) show
her to be a lively young woman who loved outings, visits, balls, card
evenings, gossip and all the rest of the social hoo-ha as much as the
next woman.
The main thrust of the case against Jane, according to her detractors,
is that at a time when Europe was in chaos from the Napoleonic wars,
when the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution were changing the
social map of Britain, she chose to devote herself to what were in
effect upper middle-class Aga sagas.
It's a familiar criticism, timeless, and one recognised by writers the
world over. Translated, it means, we don't like this book on the grounds
that it's that book.
For the fact is that all writers ink out their territory and Jane
marked hers out firmly early on: ''3 or 4 families in a Country Village
is the very thing to work on,'' she wrote.
To her brother Edward she gave the best and now most famous
description of her writing: ''The little bit (two inches wide) of ivory
on which I work with so fine a brush . . . '' and that was the way she
worked. Like an artist. On a miniature.
For the world of war and social change outside the village is not
ignored, instead it is filtered down through that piece of ivory,
through the lives of the characters and the community in which they
live.
For village life, small town life, does filter down great events
beyond its boundaries, even now. And how much more would it have done so
in Jane Austen's time, when a great percentage of the population did not
read, and daily newspapers, with their three-month-old war reports,
still sold only several thousand copies?
The Napoleonic wars are there in her novels and seamless backdrop, in
the encampment of the military regiment which brings Whickham to Lydia
in Pride and Prejudice for instance, and more especially in the persons
of both Admiral Croft and Captain Wentworth in Persuasion, who each owe
their rise in the world to their naval war service.
In Admiral Croft's case, that rise has been such that it permits him,
symbolically, to rent the stately home of the vain and foolish
cash-strapped aristocrat Sir Walter Elliot. And it's hard to see how
critics can accuse Jane Austen of ignoring the social revolution going
on around her when, certainly in the case of Pesuasion, it's the axis on
which the novel rests.
Neither is it easy to see how she can be accused of regretting the
demise of the old social order when her portrait of Sir Walter is one of
the most wickedly scathing which she painted.
We can be in no doubt of the author's feelings when Sir Walter
explains his disapproval of the Navy on the grounds that it is ''the
means of bringing persons of obscure birth to undue distinction,'' or
indeed when he swells with pride told by the appallingly snobbish and
sycophantic Mrs Clay that every profession puts a mark on a man's face
and his complexion is blissfully free from such vulgar injury.
Idle men do not fare well in Jane Austen's novels, Mr Bennet in Pride
and Prejudice, Fanny's drunken father in Mansfield Park, the
self-obsessed hypochondriachal Mr Woodhouse in Emma. But then idle women
get short shrift too.
For if Jane Austen approved of careers for men, then it can truly be
said that she did for women too. And there was only one career then for
most women and that was marriage. And marriage, in the end, is what her
novels are about.
Much time has been spent by critics trying to decide whether Jane
approved or disapproved of marriage. Famously, she did not marry
herself. To approve or disapprove though would have been an irrelevance.
Marriage was the reality for most women at the time.
What Jane wanted was to see her women, and her man, well married. She
wanted women to be mature, intelligent, morally autonomous human beings,
capable of choosing for themselves the best possible life partner. And
it's always worth reminding ourselves that partners, in the main, were
for life then, and thus the choice of them, particularly for women, the
most serious of propositions.
Her portrait gallery of society grotesques, weak parents, family
friends (often spinsters dependent upon their fawning for their living),
acquaintantances with their own axes to grind, shows just how unwise it
was for a woman to look for help in that choice outside of her own
heart. It was for just this reason that Jane wanted her women to know
their own hearts.
She wanted women to marry neither in excesses of love as Lydia does
Whickham in Pride and Prejudice, nor yet without it like Maria Bertram
in Mansfield Park.
She would not have them marry for money, but neither would she
have them disregard it. Penury for women, whether it be in the person of
the dependent female relative or the unwisely wed wife is not painted
prettily by Jane Austen.
To suggest, as some critics seem to do, that all of this given the
times in which she lived was somehow an insufficient calling for her art
seems quite extraordinary.
* The serialisation of Pride and Prejudice begins on BBC1 tomorrow
evening.

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND'S only colony of dolphins is under threat from an unusual
skin disease which scientists fear may be caused by human pollution.
The sickness has affected all but 10 of the world's most northerly
bottlenose dolphins swimming in the Moray Firth.
Some of the mammals are in obvious discomfort while others have
developed humps and deformed fins which impede their swimming.
Most of the group, which numbers 130, have developed the black spots,
white rings, and swellings which are causing concern to
conservationists.
Dr Ben Wilson, who is leading a study into the disease, said: ''They
are swimming in a cocktail of chemicals of human origin, any one of
which could be the cause.''
His colleague, Dr Phillip Hammond, of the Government-sponsored Sea
Mammal Research Unit, Cambridge, is also studying the problem and fears
that the disease could mean the dolphins of Moray Firth could become
extinct.
He said: ''The population is so small already that even a small
decrease in numbers could render the colony unviable.''
The researchers cannot examine the mammals at close quarters, so have
built up a library of thousands of photographs to show the spread of the
disease.
They are also examining dead dolphins washed up on the shores of the
Moray Firth for toxins in their skin.
Dr Wilson, of Aberdeen University, has been studying the dolphins for
almost seven years and is now one year into a three-year investigation
of the disease, jointly funded by the Department of the Environment and
the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food.
He said yesterday: ''We noticed unusual skin patterns on the dolphins
when we began our study in 1989 but they may have been there much
longer.
''We need to find out if there is any effect on the birth rate or life
span of the dolphins, and that will obviously take a numbers of years.''
Another possible theory being investigated is that cuts and bruises
may not heal properly and leave ugly marks because the colony swims in
much colder waters than normal.
* Berwickshire District Council is to ask the Government to carry out
a scientific investigation to establish the reason for a big reduction
in the number of shellfish in inland waters around the coast of
Scotland, following concerns expressed by fishermen at Eyemouth,
Burnmouth, and St Abbs.

AN expert involved in a scheme which helped identify the prevalance of
HIV infection among Scottish prisoners fears that the scheme may be at
risk because of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth's plans for mandatory
drug testing.
Dr Shiela Gore is joint head of the voluntary saliva testing
programme. She said yesterday: ''It would be a waste of public money to
attempt to run such programmes again in a climate of mandatory drug
testing.
''We do not think it is reasonable to expect prisoners to volunteer to
the same high level as they have done previously. In a sense, their
trust in the research process, allied to the fact that public health
actions followed their provision of data, has been thrown back in their
faces.''
The immediate casualties of the changed climate among Scottish
prisoners, as demonstrated this week by the cancellation of a visit by
the Princess Royal to Glenochil Prison because of fears of
demonstrations, will be voluntary saliva testing programmes at prisons
in Bishopbriggs and Aberdeen.
Dr Gore, of the Medical Research Council's biostatistics unit in
Cambridge, said yesterday that these prisons had been chosen because the
eight programmes already held had shown risk behaviour among inmates at
various institutions differing from region to region and reflecting the
prisoners' communities.
Prisons had also developed a range of measures to help inmates adopt a
drug-free lifestyle.
Dr Gore said yesterday: ''The programmes were successful and accepted
by the prisoners. The reasons were respected by the prisoners and told
us not only about their health but about public health in their
communities. These men and women were willing participants in giving
information for the public weal, and this is the thanks they get instead
of the help for their addiction which is required.''
There had been a high response to voluntary saliva testing, 82% of the
3564 available prisoners having taken part in eight studies, costs had
been low and the methodology had attracted international recognition.
Immunologist Dr Graham Bird of Oxford, who also heads the project,
pointed out that the Scottish Office should have looked more closely at
what was happening in England and Wales before bringing in mandatory
random drug testing, criticising the move as a ''simplistic response to
a very complex problem''.
He and Dr Gore have made their views known in a letter to Mr Forsyth,
who announced his intention to have mandatory random drugs testing in
Scottish jails as soon as possible two weeks ago.
The letter has also been signed by 35 prominent experts in the
addiction and public health fields.
Current schemes for voluntary referral to in-prison agencies for
alcohol support and methadone programmes will be compromised, they
claim.

MORRISON Developments Ltd is one of three companies which have been
invited to tender for the contract to provide the new North of Scotland
Water Authority's headquarters in Inverness.
Morrison's involvement with the contract was the subject of a Scottish
Office inquiry last month.
This followed disclosures in The Herald that the company had been
working with the authority in preparation of the building's
specification for some weeks, allowing the company to lodge a detailed
planning application days before competitors in the Highlands had
received the specification.
The authority had rejected an offer to meet another Highland firm to
discuss the HQ, saying it was too early, despite already working with
Morrison.
A similar approach had been adopted in Grampian and Tayside, where the
authority was also considering locating its HQ, with one firm in each
being selected to work on the specification.
In a statement yesterday afternoon, the authority said: ''The North of
Scotland Water Authority, through its agents DM Hall, has issued
invitations to tender for the provision of a new headquarters building
in Inverness.
''The authority has decided to invite proposals for a purpose-built
development. Three companies, Upland Tulloch Developments Ltd, Morrison
Developments Ltd, and Robertson Developments Ltd, have been invited to
tender, on the basis of both leasehold and outright purchase.''

STRATHCLYDE education officials launched an inquiry yesterday in a bid
to find out how a two-year-old boy was left locked up inside a day care
centre as staff set off for a weekend holiday.
Members of staff at the centre in Glasgow's Barlanark housing estate
could face disciplinary action depending on the outcome of the
investigation, which will be carried out ''speedily''.
The disappearance of Calum Brown led to a search by police and social
workers after his mother Lorraine, 21, of Garvel Crescent, Barlanark,
arrived to pick him up to find the Children's Centre had been locked up
and shuttered.
Calum was found just over an hour later by a cleaner called to open up
the centre after a security alarm went off.
Social workers found the youngster in a cot in the centre's play area.
Yesterday at a news conference Mr Tom Macdougall, Strathclyde
assistant director of education, said: ''We are extremely concerned that
this has occurred and an investigation is already under way.
''It is something that should never have happened because we do have a
system where every child is checked in and out of the centre.''
The inquiry will try to find out how Calum was missed when staff
checked the centre before locking up.
It was while the cleaner was checking the centre that she answered a
panic call from Calum's 39-year-old step-grandmother and agreed to help
and, 25 minutes later, telephoned to say the boy had been found.
Yesterday Mr Macdougall said he did not yet know what had gone wrong.
He said: ''We have a very strict system for checking children in and
out of the centre. Hopefully the inquiry will reveal what went wrong on
this occasion. Naturally we are concerned. One thing we will have to
ensure is that this sort of situation never happens again.''
He added: ''We will also look at procedures. If there has been a
breach of procedure then we may have to look at the possibility of
disciplining staff.
''At this early stage it is too early to say what might happen. But we
are planning to carry out the investigation as speedily as possible.''
The boy's mother was not available for comment last night.

relaunched his recording career in Scotland. After hits such as Matthew
and Son and Morning Has Broken, he relinquished the rock 'n' roll
lifestyle in the late 1970s when he embraced Islam.
He was in Edinburgh and Glasgow on a tour to promote his first album
in 17 years, the Life of the Last Prophet. In Edinburgh he gave a talk
entitled Muhammad Messenger of Peace, Islam's Vision of Peace. The event
was part of Islam Awareness Week.

THE Scottish Office is to commission a study to see if an avalanche
information service for Scottish climbers and hill walkers could be
improved.
The move, announced yesterday by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth,
follows the deaths of 10 people in avalanches last winter -- nearly
three times higher than the previous winter.
Mr Forsyth made the announcement during a visit to the Cairngorms. The
survey will cost more than #5000.
The Scottish Sports Council avalanche information service costs
#70,000 per year to run. It provides daily avalanche risk reports by
telephone, fax, and on the Internet for Glencoe, Lochaber, and the
Cairngorms from mid-December until mid-April.
Mr Forsyth said: ''The popularity of hill walking and mountain
climbing in Scotland continues to grow and it is essential that safety
is uppermost in the minds of all those who will take advantage of
Scotland's natural environment, particularly over this coming winter
season.''
He added: ''The Government's support for the principle of a service to
provide avalanche information in the mountains of Scotland is not in
doubt and I look forward to receiving in due course the report of the
review group set up to consider whether any improvements to the current
arrangements can be made.''
The study will be carried out over the coming winter season and
involve a survey of mountaineers and hill walkers.

THE National Audit Office is investigating the transfer of National
Health Service computers to a private company, it was confirmed last
night by the Scottish Office.
Computing Sciences Corporation Ltd secured the contract to operate
most of Scotland's health board and hospital computers from next month.
It is understood the contract, handled by the Common Services Agency,
valued the computer equipment at less than #3m. Some sources within the
NHS have claimed the computers have a much higher valuation.
The special projects director of the CSA is Mr Laurence Peterken,
former general manager of the Greater Glasgow Health Board.
Labour last night called upon the Scottish Secretary to set up an
inquiry into the transfer of the assets. Mr George Robertson, Shadow
Scottish Secretary, said: ''The whole issue really has to be looked at
in terms of value for money in what is one of the biggest spending
departments of State.'' He said he was pleased the National Audit Office
was investigatiing, but added the ''Secretary of State has also got an
obligation in this matter.''
A Scottish Office spokeswoman, who said the National Audit Office was
examining the process under which the assets were transferred, said
market testing of NHS computing systems in Scotland would release
millions of pounds over the next three to five years for patient care.
''The disposal of the existing assets have followed the normal rules.
The assets involved were independently valued by the Central Computer
and Telecommunications Agency, the Government computer agency, who will
have taken into account the age and size of the equipment involved in an
area where technology advances so quickly.''

AVERAGE council tax bills in Dundee are likely to rise by almost 50%
or #350 next year unless the Government takes action to increase grants,
the new city council warned yesterday.
Such a huge increase would push the average payment to more than
#1050.
The prediction came as Scottish council leaders, meeting in Edinburgh,
fiercely attacked the Government's policy of insisting that public
sector pay awards must be funded from efficiency savings.
Cosla's Labour president Rosemary McKenna said councils could not
continue to bear this burden for the third year running without ''an
inevitable loss in jobs'' and cutbacks in services.
She claimed the Scottish people would have to pay the price for what
was an obvious manoeuvre on the Government's behalf to achieve tax
savings before the next General Election.
Cosla says that over three years the Government's policy of refusing
to fund pay awards is costing councils #216m.

THE headteacher of Tongue Primary School, Ms Anne Scottin, yesterday
gave The Prince of Wales a history lesson, pointing out that another
Prince Charles came to visit the Kyle of Tongue 249 years ago, never to
leave.
This was the French sloop, Le Prince Charles, which had arrived in the
Pentland Firth in March 1746, three weeks before Culloden, bearing gold
and 120 soldiers for the Jacobite cause. She had tried to escape from
four men o' war from the Royal Navy, but was pursued by a frigate which
was faster.
Eventually, her master had run Le Prince Charles into the shallows of
the Kyle of Tongue, but the frigate followed. After three hours of
cannonade, all the Frenchman's gunners were dead. The remainder of the
ship's company fled, taking with them as many boxes of gold coins as
they could.
Ms Scottin said: ''I explained to the prince that they had thought
they were in Jacobite territory but they were in MacKay land, and Lord
Reay was a staunch Hanoverian.
''I was pointing to where Le Prince Charles, which had formerly been
called the Hazard, had been sunk. I said that, had she got away, the
course of history could have been changed with these men getting to
Culloden to fight for the Jacobite cause.
''I was also telling him of a team of American treasure hunters who
are supposed to be coming over soon to dive and see if there is any gold
to be found.
''I found the visit delightful. We talked about the different cultures
that go to make up the UK and how important they all are, and how
important it is that each area remembers its own story.''

THE Government said yesterday that there was no going back on care in
the community, in the knowledge that two reports into killings by
psychiatric patients are due to be published.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell admitted that the policy had
''undoubtedly come under strain'' but ruled out a return to the
''sinister, forbidding'' Victorian asylums and claimed that most people
could be treated successfully within the community.
Only last month, Ministers gave health authorities three months to
improve services after two Government reports showed psychiatric
services were in ''turmoil'' in some areas.
Next week, the policy will come under scrutiny again with the opening
of an inquiry into the killings of three people by a schizophrenic, and
the release of two highly critical reports into killings by mental
patients.
At the annual social services conference in Bournemouth, Mr Dorrell
said social services and health authorities had to work together to
provide care if public confidence in the policy was to be maintained.
This had to be done within existing resources.
While he accepted that there was a need for more residential care, he
said this should be only a ''fraction'' of the beds provided in the days
of the old asylums.
''The idea that we go back to the institutional care of the 1950s . .
. is not an option. The emphasis must be on support for people in the
community, not away from it.''
On Monday, an inquiry will examine how Jason Mitchell walked out of a
psychiatric hospital and killed an elderly couple and his father.
On the same day, a report will be published into the killing of Bryan
Bennett, a patient at the Worlands Day centre, Newham, east London, by
fellow patient Stephen Laudat.
Laudat believed Mr Bennett was one of the Kray twins.
Later in the week, the Mental Health Act Commission will examine
psychiatric services in Nottingham after a patient in a ''half-way
house'' stabbed to death another resident.
David Usoro, 28, who suffers from a schizomanic illness, had warned
staff he might injure himself and others hours before the killing. He
admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Mr Dorrell said that recent tragedies had highlighted the need for
health and social services to work together to provide a wide range of
support.
He said new ways had to be found of reaching out to people who were
homeless or sleeping rough.
Delegates highlighted the need for more cash for social services and
mental health services. However, Mr Dorrell said he did not want to make
any public comment on funding during the current spending round.

Moscow
''POWER struggles'' have taken on a dangerous meaning in Russia's far
north, where heavily armed sailors were used to force the local electric
company to restore power to a nuclear submarine base cut off for not
paying its bills.
The power to Russia's Northern Fleet was suddenly switched off on
Wednesday because the navy owes #3m.
But that set off fears of a disastrous nuclear meltdown as the
reactors aboard ageing nuclear subs were left with their cooling systems
crippled.
With the vessels' on-board generators refusing to start, temperatures
began to soar and sailors in bullet-proof vests took matters into their
own hands.
They stormed into two electricity substations yesterday and forced the
duty engineers to switch on the power at gunpoint.
The fleet then took over all the sub-stations servings its nuclear
installations near Murmansk, on the Kola Peninsula.
The navy today denied any danger of a nuclear accident, insisting its
submarines are completely ''reliable.''
But fleet spokesman Vladimir Kondriyanenko said that ''switching off
the power for even a few minutes can cause an emergency.''
Fleet commander Admiral Oleg Yerofeyev called the power cut ''an act
of sabotage''.
''It's true the fleet owes the company a lot of money,'' spokesman
Kondriyanenko admitted. ''But almost every state-run organisation,
including the military, has some debts.''
The military newspaper Red Star ran an angry story on its front page
today saying Russia's strategic forces are so desperate for cash that
they hire out troops for menial work like potato-picking.
Power company spokesman Viktor Krivtsov said a written protest had
been sent to the fleet command.--Reuter.

Washington
ISRAEL and the PLO are very close to completing a Palestinian
self-rule agreement that has involved intensive round-the-clock
mediation by the United States over long-distance telephone, the State
Department said today.
''It's our impression that they are very close,'' spokesman Nicholas
Burns told reporters.
Burns repeated the US offer to host a signing ceremony for the accord
in Washington but said that could not be set until the two sides reached
a final agreement on widening Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank.
But an official told reporters anonymously that Thursday, September 28
is the tentative date for the ceremony.
Burns described the US role in recent days as a ''Kissinger-like
shuttle by phone'' in which Secretary of State Warren Christopher and US
Mideast negotiator Dennis Ross engaged in intensive contacts with the
parties from Washington, sometimes in conference calls.
One official said a key moment occurred last Tuesday when it looked
like PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat would leave the talks with Israel taking
place in the Egyptian town of Taba. Christopher telephoned Arafat and
told him he would be better served by remaining at the talks and Arafat
complied, the official said.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chief Yasser Arafat
failed to conclude an agreement on wider Palestinian self-rule today,
but both men said they would resume their marathon talks tomorrow
night.--Reuter.

St Louis
OLIVER McCall, who lost his world heavyweight boxing title to Frank
Bruno earlier this month at Wembley Stadium, lost even more in St Louis.
Three men robbed McCall of his purse -- a cheque for $1,405,238 --
about 3am yesterday in a public housing complex, police said.
McCall had tried to keep the cheque he earned in an unsuccessful
defence of his World Boxing Council title on September 2 by hiding it in
a sock.
Police quickly arrested two of the suspects and recovered the cheque,
which had been signed by boxing promoter Don King.
Reached later at a city centre hotel, McCall, 30, of Bassett,
Virginia, said: ''Man, I don't know what you're talking about,'' he
said. ''I love St Louis. What robbery? I wasn't robbed.''
Police said the two men under arrest probably will not be formally
charged because McCall said he did not wish to press charges.--AP.

Anchorage, Alaska
THIRTEEN people were confirmed dead after a US Air Force surveillance
plane with 24 people on board crashed in a fireball soon after take-off
from an air base in Alaska today, officials said.
Major Jerry Brown, spokesman for Elmendorf Air Force Base outside
Anchorage, said emergency workers were in the process of recovering 13
bodies and searching for the other 11 people on board the high-tech E3
Awacs plane.
''There are no reports of survivors as of right now,'' he said.
It was the first time one of the high-tech planes, which carry out
radar reconnaissance and surveillance, has crashed since they entered
service in 1977, the Air Force said.
Eyewitnesses said the plane crashed in a fireball in a heavily wooded
area near the base, sending up a thick plume of black smoke.
Brown said the plane crashed about two miles northeast of the runway.
The area is so thickly wooded that emergency workers initially had to
use four-wheel-drive vehicles and motorcycles to get to the scene, he
said.
Army airborne troops based nearby went to the crash site on foot to
help, he said. Medical and fire crews were at the scene, he said, and
emergency workers bulldozed roads to the site to make recovery efforts
easier.
Brown said he had ''no idea'' of the cause of the crash and that would
probably not be known until the cockpit recorder was recovered. He said
the plane had been setting off on a routine four-hour training mission.
One witness told CBS radio news the plane appeared too low after
takeoff and it banked, stalled and crashed into trees.
The base said in a statement that a board of officers would
investigate the accident.
The huge Awacs (Airborne Warning and Control System) planes can
operate as an airborne control tower. They usually carry a flight crew
of four plus a mission crew of between 13 and 19 depending on the
mission, Pentagon officials said.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>A 'betrayal' by Tories. Storm over rise in taxes</HEADLINE>

THE Inland Revenue has revealed that the amount of tax collected in
the past year has increased substantially. The figures provoked a
political row, with Labour claiming theyproved the Tories have betrayed
the British electorate.
According to Inland Revenue statistics published yesterday, the number
of people paying income tax has also risen by 300,000 since the 1992
General Election and all earners are paying more tax.
Labour Treasury spokesman, Mr Andrew Smith, said the figures proved
the Government had broken the promises of its 1992 manifesto. ''These
come as renewed proof of Tory betrayal on tax.''
The Government claimed this was a natural consequence of an expanding
economy and an increase in employment.
Ms Angela Knight, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: ''Two
facts really matter. First, more people are in work and more people are
earning money and that's what these figures confirm.''
However, despite her assertion, this will only add to the pressure at
next month's Tory Party conference. Back-bench MPs and grassroots
activists are pressing the Prime Minister to deliver an election-winning
tax cut and have tabled at least 200 motions on tax for the conference.
However, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke warned that the delicate state of
the public finances meant tax cuts were not yet ''in the bag'', and
would require a substantial reduction in Government expenditure.
Whatever the outcome within the Tory Party, Labour has seized on the
figures, claiming tax-payers across the board were being hit, with more
middle income earners being dragged into the higher band.
The Opposition's economists, after examining the Inland Revenue
Statistics 1995, concluded:
* Everyone is paying more in income tax;
* 300,000 more people are paying income tax;
* People now start paying income tax at less than a quarter of average
earnings;
* Almost half a million people (480,000) are paying income tax at the
higher rate.
Neither the Inland Revenue nor the Treasury disputed the figures,
although Tory politicians said it was a matter of interpretation.
However, Mr Smith maintained: ''Just to turn round their election
deceit, the Tories would have to cut income tax by the equivalent of 7p
in the pound.''
He added: ''Tory betrayal is now reaching further than ever before. It
is not only those at the bottom end of the scale who are suffering but
middle income Britain is also feeling the pinch of Tory tax hikes.''
Mrs Knight retorted: ''The truth is, if we had maintained the tax
regime we inherited from the last Labour Government, there would be no
20p tax band, no 25p tax band -- only 35p and upwards. If Labour want to
talk about tax, let's see their plans.''
Labour said the figures showed that the tax hike since the last
election had hit those on lower incomes hardest. Between 1992-93 and
1995-96, the proportion of earnings paid in income tax by a married man
on half average earnings had risen by a third. Yet a married man on
average earnings was paying 7% more, while a married man on five times
average earnings was paying 2% more.
The figures also showed that people started paying tax at a lower
threshold, according to Labour.
* Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth last night attacked the taxation
plans of the Liberal Democrats over education and its so-called Tartan
Tax which would be imposed by a Scottish parliament.
''Their education proposals this week alone would put 2.5p on income
tax and the Tartan Tax would add another 3p,'' he said.

A LINK between birthdays and examination performance among Scottish
youngsters has been established by the country's external assessment
body.
According to research released yesterday by the Scottish Examination
Board, children at the older end of the 16s group do better in their
Standard Grade exams.
The board, which is responsible for Standard Grade, Higher, and Sixth
Year Studies exams, said it may surprise secondary teachers to learn
that there is an age factor in exam performance. Primary teachers are
said to expect older children in a year group to perform better.
The two-year Standard Grade course has replaced the O-Grade as the
nationally recognised leaving qualification for 16 year olds. Each
subject has its own balance of internal, classroom-based assessment and
external exams.
In English, the main subject, the external exam accounts for one-third
of the course.
The board analysed pupil performance in last year's Standard Grade
exams and, after grouping them by age and gender, found there was a
clear trend, with the oldest -- those born in March, 1978 -- gaining on
average one-fifth of a grade better over all subjects than the youngest
-- those born in February, 1979.
This could result in older pupils who took seven or eight Standard
Grades getting one grade better in one or two subjects than younger
ones. There are seven levels ranging from one, the highest, to seven,
the lowest.
For pupils born outside the age group, however, the results were the
opposite. Those born before March, 1978, performed on average more
poorly, while those who were much younger performed better, because they
were exceptionally gifted.
Most were presented for the exam in first, second, or third year.
''In general, the older pupils did slightly better than the younger
ones, averaged over all subjects,'' said the board.
''While these patterns apply equally for boys and girls, they should
be seen against a general background of girls' attainment being better
than boys' on average at this stage of schooling,'' it pointed out.
It said maturity was a factor in pupils' general ability.
At Higher Grade, the impact of the difference in age was not so great.
''This perhaps illustrates that at Higher Grade the maturity gap is
closing,'' the board said.

Sarajevo
BOSNIA'S Muslim-led government tried to dictate ceasefire terms today
to end the 3[1/2]-year war and told the increasingly embattled Serbs to
give up control of their stronghold of Banja Luka.
But the Serbs showed no signs of agreeing to the terms and said they
were launching attacks to repel the joint Muslim-Croat offensive which
has pushed Serbs from a vast area of territory in western Bosnia over
the past two weeks.
''We have stopped this offensive and we will try to liberate some of
these traditional Serb territories,'' Serb president Radovan Karadzic
told reporters in Banja Luka.
Bosnia's Muslim President Alija Izetbegovic had called on the Serbs
yesterday to demilitarise Banja Luka, giving effective military control
of the area to the Muslim and Croat forces.
He followed that up on Friday with conditions for a ceasefire covering
the whole country on terms the Serbs seem equally unlikely to accept.
A letter from Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey to the UN Security
Council demanded the complete lifting of the Serb siege of Sarajevo and
the opening of a secure road to the Muslim enclave of Gorazde which
Serbs surround in eastern Bosnia.
Meeting either condition would mean a further loss of leverage in
peace talks for the Serbs who were forced to remove most of their siege
guns from around Sarajevo by Nato bombing this month. They have also
been battered by the Muslim-Croat offensive which has redrawn the map
close to the 49-51% division on which international peace efforts are
predicated.
''We will not accept the results of this aggression after the Nato
bombardment and after the Geneva accords. All of it is illegal and it
has to be null and void,'' Karadzic said,
Sacirbey staked out the Sarajevo government's position ahead of the
next round of diplomatic bargaining over Bosnia's future which is to
take place in New York next Tuesday.
The foreign ministers of Bosnia, Croatia and Yugoslavia -- which
represents the Bosnian Serbs -- will meet US and European Union
mediators.
The United Nations, having made the Serbs pull back their tanks and
artillery from Sarajevo and persuaded the Muslims and Croats to halt an
offensive in northwest Bosnia, is anxious to make progress towards an
overall peace.
''Although the city of Sarajevo is a relatively safe place these days,
a formal cessation of hostilities for the Sarajevo area has still not
been concluded,'' said UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko.
''Such an agreement would help cement the current climate of stability
in the city and would provide the framework for a further countrywide
cessation of hostilities agreement.''
Peacekeepers said frontlines had stabilised around Banja Luka and the
Ozren area of northern Bosnia after almost two weeks of gains by allied
Muslim and Croat forces against the Bosnian Serb Army (BSA).
But Serb media claimed fighting had continued on both fronts and the
UN admitted it was handicapped in assessing the situation by lack of
access to the areas.
Peacekeepers speculated that government forces might have halted their
drive northwards from Maglaj to the Serb-held town of Doboj which
commands access to Ozren.
Meanwhile, Nato confirmed today that it carried out three helicopter
commando missions this month to try to find two French airmen shot down
by Bosnian Serbs and said two Americans were wounded in the operation.
Nato's southern commander, US Admiral Leighton Smith, said the two
Americans suffered shrapnel injuries when their MH-53 helicopter was hit
by small arms fire during the third mission, conducted on September 8.
* Greeks and US sailors traded punches as protests against warships
calling at Corfu on their way to duty off Bosnia erupted on the the
holiday island .
Several hundred protesters chanted ''No to American warships in our
port'', ''Americans out of Corfu'' and ''Americans - Killers'' during
the demonstration last night..--Reuter.

SCOTTISH Office Minister George Kynoch yesterday fired a warning shot
across the bows of Monklands District Council, the day after the local
authority condemned an inquiry by Professor Robert Black into claims of
nepotism and a spending bias in the district.
Councillors described the Black report -- which the council
commissioned -- as inaccurate and misleading, and said it was seriously
deficient in factual evidence.
Mr Kynoch, Local Government Minister at the Scottish Office, while
refusing to comment directly on the council's criticisms, warned that it
must comply fully with the official Government investigation into
allegations of malpractice.
The report, published last June, included allegations of illegal
conduct, which had been passed to the Crown Office, and a spending gap
on major projects between the mainly Catholic Coatbridge and Protestant
Airdrie.
A Crown Office spokesman confirmed yesterday that allegations made in
the report were still under investigation by the procurator-fiscal in
Airdrie.
Professor Black's report also found cases of nepotism in the
recruitment policies of Monklands, with 16 out of 21 councillors having
relatives -- some close relatives -- working for the council, and
religious favouritism, but only in the context of nepotism, rather than
for sectarian reasons.
The Monklands response, released on Thursday, claimed that a number of
allegations in Professor Black's report were either misleading, untrue,
or otherwise totally unsupported by any reliable evidence.
Mr Kynoch said: ''An official inquiry is now under way and we must
await the results. Monklands must show the desire to be totally open in
co-operating with the official investigation which the Government has
undertaken.
''This is the only way to clear the air on this matter.''
Councillor Peter Sullivan, speaking on behalf of four Monklands
district rebel councillors, criticised the local authority for being
''highly selective'' in plucking figures from Professor Black's report.
He said: ''It has manipulated the figures to achieve the result of
fairness it hoped to get.
''While there were one or two practical inaccuracies in Professor
Black's report, overall we feel it reflected the deeply held feelings of
many of the people in Airdrie.''
SNP Monklands group spokesman, Councillor Neil Douglas, said he would
table a motion at a full council meeting next Thursday, calling for the
resignation of the entire Labour administration.
He said: ''It is disgraceful that the Labour Party cabal continues to
juggle figures when it is quite evident there was a bias of spending and
there was an extraordinarily high proportion of Labour party
councillor's relatives working for the council.''
Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party,
said a Labour Party inquiry was under way, adding that it would not be
appropriate to make any further comment.
Neither Professor Black nor Monklands East Labour MP Helen Liddell
were available for comment yesterday.

A 17-YEAR-OLD was sentenced to life detention yesterday for the murder
of a teenager.
During a five-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow, Nikki Glencross,
of Sunnybank Street, Dalmarnock, had denied mudering Andrew Skinner, 17,
with a single knife blow on May 28 last year.
Mr Skinner, of Allan Street, Dalmarnock, bled to death after the knife
went through his neck, severing a main artery and puncturing his lung.
He was found slumped on his grandmother's doorstep after the attack.
The judge, Lord Marnock, described it as a ''vicious and nasty
murder''.
As he was being led from the dock, Glencross screamed abuse at the
jury.
Advocate-depute Ronald Clancy, prosecuting, told the jury that
Glencross had been drunk, aggressive, and angry on the the night of the
murder because he had a row with his girlfriend.
He had kicked the girl and headbutted another teenager, knocking out
his front teeth, before stabbing his victim in a fit of rage.
Three girls told the court how Glencairn had shouted at them: ''I'll
stab the lot of you.''
When he was told he had stabbed Andrew, they claimed he replied: ''Aye
. . . ha ha.''
Glencross claimed in evidence that a 14-year-old boy had committed the
murder.

A SECOND World War airman who was the forger behind one of the war's
greatest escapes, immortalised in the classic film The Great Escape, has
died at his home in Edinburgh, aged 73.
Mr Duncan Black was the mastermind behind one of the war's most daring
passport and documents forgery operations and later served as the
inspiration for Donald Pleasance's famous character.
The former Scottish Office architect and wartime navigator with Bomber
Command spent two years as a PoW in Stalag Luft III after being shot
down over Dusseldorf in 1943.
He led a team of forgers who produced hundreds of documents
painstakingly drawn by hand using basic materials. The forgers also
cobbled together civilian clothes and Nazi uniforms from shabby prison
uniforms and manufactured compasses for those prisoners who managed to
escape.
Mr Black was liberated from the camp by the Americans in 1945 and on
returning home studied architecture. He became deputy chief architect
with the Scottish Office and worked on the designs of new towns,
including Glenrothes, before retiring in 1982.
Mr Black was not married. His funeral service will be held on Monday
in Edinburgh's Warriston Cemetery.

THE Princess of Wales is to be crowned international Humanitarian of
the Year.
She joins a distinguished list of past winners including Lady Thatcher
and former American presidents Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald
Ford.
The princess will receive the prestigious award in December at a
glittering gala evening in New York.
Also receiving an award will be Gulf War hero General Colin Powell.
The award -- other winners include Hillary Clinton, Norman
Schwarzkopf, Henry Kissinger, and Mrs Nelson Rockefeller -- is made by
the United Cerebral Palsy Association of America, in recognition of the
princess's support and work for charity.
Cerebral Palsy is a disorder close to the princess's heart and she has
been closely associated with work to help sufferers over the past five
years.
She is patron of the Foundation for Conductive Education, a form of
teaching -- sometimes known as the Peto method -- which is effective in
treating cerebral palsy sufferers.
The award carries with it a contribution to a British-based Cerebral
Palsy charity.
The disclosure of the humanitarian award comes after a high-profile
visit to Italy last week when the princess was guest-of-honour at a
charity concert, for the traumatised children of war-torn Bosnia, given
by opera star Luciano Pavarotti.
Next Monday, she flies to Paris to view an exhibition of paintings by
French impressionist Cezanne and attend a fund-raising dinner in aid of
Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital.
The princess is thought to support more than 100 charities.

T-SHIRTS showing Prince William at Eton were removed from sale last

The Eton T-Shirt Company produced three ranges. Some with an image of
the prince on his own, others with him flanked by two friends in their
Eton tail coats with the words The Firm printed in large letters.
The company had failed to seek royal permission.
A spokeswoman for the Prince of Wales said: ''We will inform the Lord
Chamberlain's Office.''
T-shirt company owner Jonathan Rolls immediately withdrew the shirts,
price #15, from sale.
''I don't want to upset anyone, least of all Eton College and the
royal family,'' said Mr Rolls. ''I sent a message, via a couple of
William's friends, to ask if he minded us using his picture and, when we
heard nothing from him, we presumed it was okay.''

A 20-YEAR-OLD man died and his companion is in a serious condition
suffering from head and chest injuries after a road accident near
Faslane naval base yesterday morning.
The body of Mr Anthony Currie, of Southannan Road, Helensburgh, was
found inside a car which had left the road and gone down an embankment
off the B814 road to Garelochhead.
The car's 20-year-old driver was found lying seriously injured a short
distance from the car. He was taken to the Vale of Leven Hospital. He
has not been named.
No other vehicles are believed to have been involved in the accident.
In a separate accident, a woman was seriously injured when the driver
of a milk delivery van apparently lost control of his vehicle and
collided with her car on the B833 Garelochhead-to-Rosneath road at about
6.45am yesterday.
Ms Judith Curwen, 24, of Broom Road, Rosneath, was freed from her car
by the fire service and taken to the Vale of Level Hospital suffering
from serious head injuries.
She was later transferred to Southern General Hospital in Glasgow,
where her condition was described as critical.
The driver of the delivery van sustained minor injuries.
Dumbarton police traffic department have appealed for witnesses to
either accident.

AS the Prince of Wales was opening Kinlochbervie's new #3.3m high
school in north-west Sutherland yesterday, on the east coast of the
county parents were asking the Scottish Office why it does not apply its
''value-for-money'' yardstick to its first opted-out school, Dornoch
Academy.
The Accounts Commission for Scotland said earlier this week that local
authorities could save #25m by closing schools with spare capacity. It
concluded that an occupancy rate of just over 80% was realistic for most
schools.
At Dornoch, there is a capacity of 350. The roll is 49 pupils, or 65%
of what it was when the school opted out.
An opponent of opting out is Mrs Helen Houston, secretary of the
Sutherland Parents Action Group. It was set up because of concern about
the effects of the Dornoch opt-out on secondary education elsewhere in
Sutherland.
According to Mrs Houston, the Accounts Commission allows for schools
in remote areas such as Kinlochbervie.
The high school there has only 26 pupils in S1 and S2 at present but
this will increase towards its 90 capacity as other years came in.
Mrs Houston said: ''I quite understand why schools with small rolls
like Kinlochbervie have to be protected. The pupils used to come 74
miles to stay in hostels in Golspie. I used to work in the school hostel
at Dornoch looking after such children, and sympathise with parents
wanting them home.
''The position at Dornoch is quite different. It lies between Golspie
High School and Tain Royal Academy, 10 miles either way. Capacity at
Tain is 905, at Golspie 744, and at Dornoch Academy 350. The total
secondary pupil population this year is 1544, leaving a total of 455
surplus places in the area.
''With a roll of only 49 pupils, just 65% of what it was when the
school opted out, Dornoch Academy unnecessarily provides the bulk of
surplus places. At a cost per pupil of #7897.95, it is hardly providing
value for money.''
Mrs Houston said that if Dornoch was given permission to upgrade
progressively from its present two years status to a full six-year
school, and if it took pupils from Tain and Golspie, it would just
reduce these schools' value for money.
Mrs Jennifer Cameron, spokeswoman for the Dornoch Academy board of
management, said yesterday: ''I don't think we really want to get
involved in this.
''We are currently going through the consultative procedures in the
hope of winning upgrading and our long-term plans will be announced
thereafter.''
Meanwhile, across in Kinlochbervie, Highland Regional Council's
convener, Mr Duncan McPherson, was welcoming the Prince of Wales, who
had opened the redeveloped harbour there back in 1988.
Mr McPherson said: ''Once again, Prince Charles is announcing good
news as the regional council strives to remove any handicap of
remoteness that the communities served by this magnificent new school
may have to overcome.''
The school's communications systems rank with the most advanced in the
world.
* Prince Charles will part with his cherished Aston Martin convertible
before Christmas. He is hoping to raise around #110,000 for the D-reg
dark green Vantage Volante, with the cash going to his Prince's Trust
charity.

A MAN has won #750 compensation from fast-food company McDonald's
after he burnt his arm eating a hot apple pie.
Solicitor Aftab Ahmed, representing Mr Darren Miles, said he would
receive the sum and costs from McDonald's Restaurants Limited in the
out- of-court settlement.
It was claimed Mr Miles may be permanently scarred from the burn. The
pie spilled out and burned his arm after he bit it.
The incident happened in January at McDonald's in Woking, Surrey,
where Mr Miles, 28, from Weybridge, had been eating with his family.
He said he had pursued the action because he was concerned it might
have been his daughter eating the pie.
McDonald's refused to accept liability.
A statement yesterday said: ''Our insurers have agreed a settlement
with no acceptance of McDonald's liability.
''Our first concern is always for the safety of our customers. We
follow precise quality and safety specifications.''

BENAZIR Bhutto, Pakistan's Prime Minister, has ordered a monument to
be built in memory of climber Alison Hargreaves, who died on her way
down K2 last month.
The announcement came on the day Ms Hargreaves's husband, Jim Ballard,
and her two children, Tom, six, and Kate, four, set off to visit the
28,250ft peak where she died.
Mrs Bhutto has taken a personal interest in the events and invited the
family to visit Pakistan to pay homage.
Ms Hargreaves, 33, who kept her maiden name, became the first woman to
scale Everest without artificial oxygen or Sherpa porters, and also got
to the top of K2, the world's second highest peak.
She was one of a group of seven climbers who died while descending K2,
in the worst mountaineering disaster in post-war Himalayan climbing
history.
Ms Hargreaves, who was a native of Derbyshire, lived with her family
in Spean Bridge, near Fort William, and trained for her epic climbs in
the surrounding West Highland mountains, especially on 4006ft Aonach
Mor, where Mr Ballard works part-time at the Nevis Range Ski Centre.
Mr Ballard, Tom, and Kate left Fort William last night on the recently
saved overnight sleeper train to London for a flight tomorrow to
Islamabad, Pakistan's capital.
They are being accompanied on the trip by a BBC film crew which will
make a two-part documentary about their trek in Ms Hargreaves's memory.
Mr Ballard said: ''This trip will be very special to us. Tom told me
when he realised his mother would not be coming back that he wanted to
see 'mummy's last mountain'.''
He continued: ''Alison died where she most wanted to be, doing what
she wanted most to do.''
Her body has not been recovered from K2, the highest peak in
Pakistan's Karakorum range of the Western Himalayas.

THE SNP yesterday endorsed law on child abuse which would mean that,
in an independent Scotland, anyone who abused children abroad would be
liable to prosecution, as if the offence had been committed in this
country.
The conference carried unanimously a resolution supporting the
criminalisation of activities involving the sexual exploitation of
children overseas and the prosecution of companies promoting sex tourism
involving children.
The resolution stated that if evidence was available that a Scottish
citizen had been engaged in child abuse in a foreign country that would
constitute an offence under Scots law, then the circumstances should be
investigated by the police and a report prepared for the
procurator-fiscal.
Councillor Keith Robertson, convener of social work on the Perthshire
and Kinross unitary authority, who has been working on the resolution
for 14 months, told delegates that, at present, paedophiles from this
country could exploit the children of other countries for sexual purpose
with little fear of prosecution.
He said: ''As public awareness of the effects of child abuse has grown
in this country, so has the public's rejection of this unacceptable
exploitation of children.
''But by increasing the protection which we afford to our children in
this country, we may have indirectly increased the risks to children in
other countries.''
Mr Robertson, whose resolution was moved jointly with the Young
Scottish Nationalists, said that Article 34 of the UN Convention on the
Rights of the Child -- which says that states are required to take all
appropriate measures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of
children -- requires that protection be extended to all children
wherever they may live.
He said: ''Various countries, including Australia, Sweden, and
Germany, already have laws to regulate the behaviour of their citizens
in their contact with children abroad.
''The UK currently lacks any such regulatory powers. Tour operators
may be open to prosecution if they wilfully procure children in other
countries for sexual purposes.
''The adults who use these services, however, effectively remain
immune from prosecution. This anomaly defies both the spirit and the
letter of Article 34. In order to protect our own children, we must
protect the children of the world.''
Mr Robertson said he was delighted it was carried.

HOME Secretary Michael Howard professed himself deeply impressed
yesterday by the Strathclyde Police anti-drugs initiative, Operation
Eagle, rejecting the notion that it was largely a propaganda exercise.
Mr Howard's stage-managed visit to Paisley's police divisional
headquarters gave him an ideal platform for television law and order
soundbites. Police sources said later it had been his own idea, although
the hand of Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was evident.
Paisley had been chosen, not because of recent events there involving
drug-related violence but because of its proximity to Glasgow Airport,
Mr Howard's aides said.
He met Deputy Chief Constable James Richardson, Chief Superintendent
Tom Caldwell, divisional head at Paisley, Detective Superintendent Bill
Gordon, head of Paisley divisional CID, and Superintendent Alistair
McNaughton, in charge of Operation Eagle.
Asked later if he thought such high-profile operations were largely
propaganda, Mr Howard said: ''This is very far from a propaganda
campaign. Bringing the public onside is a very important part of the
task facing the police.
''One of the messages I have been trying to get across is that we
cannot leave this to the police alone. The police can only succeed
against drugs if there is a real partnership between them and the
community.''
Meanwhile, Mr Howard proclaimed a confident message that crime could
be further reduced both north and south of the Border, writes
CHRISTOPHER REEKIE.
He said in Edinburgh it would be wrong to let front-page publicity of
high-profile crimes cloud the fact that, over the past two years, real
progress had been made in curbing the apparently relentless rise in
crime over 50 years.
He paid tribute to police forces for their achievements in lowering
crime figures, which had been gained by adopting new methods, greater
use of intelligence, targeting persistent offenders, and more use of new
technology.
Expressing confidence about the future, Mr Howard said: ''We are on
the way to making this country safer and a better place in which to
live.''
Mr Howard said he was absolutely committed to this objective and he
knew Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was too. ''Together we will,
with determination, pursue policies that will deliver that objective.''
The Home Secretary was speaking after a luncheon held by Edinburgh
Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise.
During his address, he warned that the advantage Britain had
established in ''the critical margins of competitiveness'' during the
Conservative administration could be eroded and destroyed by a change of
Government at the next General Election.

<RECORDNO>976240947</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY began and ended with the SNP leadership just about
negotiating the potential pitfalls on the controversial issue of how to
deal with devolution.
The leader's speech in the afternoon successfully drew the sting from
a fringe meeting organised by The New Politics for Independence group,
which campaigns for a more firm rejection of home rule in favour of
outright independence. That group has in effect been the wing of the
party which has been behind talk this week about divisions.
One of its leading lights, national executive member Christine Creech,
stressed that she does not want a change in party policy, rather a
change in emphasis and tactics.
She said it was a fine dividing line but she believed there was a
danger in saying that the SNP would stand for election in a devolved
assembly being interpreted wrongly as support for such a body. She
believed that criticism of the inadequacies of this kind of home rule
must be stronger if this was not to happen.
''That's where a tactical change can push you unwittingly into a
policy change if you are not careful, and we have to avoid that at all
costs,'' she said.
The other speaker at last night's fringe meeting was SNP Cabinet
member Kenny MacAskill and he too stressed that the difference was one
of emphasis and tactics rather than of policy, on which he said there
had never been a split.
The devolution debate at the conference itself had become a
highly-charged affair, with Renfrew councillor Jim Mitchell storming
off, claiming he had been censored because he had not been called to
speak.
In the chair had been former party leader Gordon Wilson, who had given
the conference the opportunity to vote on whether to extend the debate
into the lunch break, which they rejected.
The debate, critical of Labour's plans for home rule, had focused on
the inability of such an assembly to deliver real change for the
business community. Mr Fergus Ewing had highlighted the ''glaring
weaknesses'' of the proposals.
He pointed out that such an assembly would be unable to set a business
rate, or tackle the scourge of late payment of bills which bankrupts
small business, or to cut red tape.
''They know fine well in the Labour Party that they haven't got the
slightest intention of allowing their pocket-money Parliament to help
Scotland's businesses,'' he said.
He contrasted this with the powers of the Irish Government and other
small European nations, and insisted that England's biggest import under
the Union had always been Scottish jobs.
Councillor Ian Angus said during the debate: ''Independence can be
achieved via devolution but only after a series of cul-de-sacs and
diversions. My money is on route one.''

Majorca
IRISH Taoiseach John Bruton rounded on Britain last night for its
record on pollution of the Irish Sea.
In a sour note at the informal summit of European Union heads of
government in Formentor, Mr Bruton described Britain's older nuclear
reactors as ''poorly maintained and shaky''.
His comments, made in a private meeting with Mr Major at which the
conversation was mainly about the British-Irish peace process, came as
French President Jacques Chirac was criticised for his continued testing
of nuclear devices in the South Pacific.
Britain's record of polluting western waters, mainly the Irish Sea,
has long angered the Irish, who refuse to build nuclear power stations
and were founder negotiators of the international nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
Over the years they have criticised the dumping of radioactive waste
from several British plants, mainly Sellafield, but including
Chapelcross, near Annan, Dumfriesshire.
In particular they were angered by the reported accident two years ago
at the Wylfa magnox plant in Wales, for which the management was heavily
fined last week.
The Irish also complained about emissions from a plant in Trawsfynydd
in Wales.
''Mr Bruton expressed his concern to Mr Major,'' an Irish official
said, without going into more detail. There was no immediate reaction
from British officials.
But Mr Major's problems with Mr Bruton were as nothing compared with
those of Mr Chirac on the nuclear issue.
Mr Chirac suffered an avalanche of criticisms last week in Santander,
Spain, when 10 EU foreign ministers, meeting informally, voiced
disapproval of French tests in the South Pacific.
''It is much the same all over again,'' said one diplomat. ''The
British are standing back from criticism of France and the Germans are
being very reticent.''
Irish officials emphasised that there was no connection with claims
that Britain was secretly co-operating with the French by seeking
scientific data from the South Pacific tests. Britain has denied
collaboration.
After two brief meetings, Mr Major and Mr Bruton remained tight-lipped
about the possibilities of a breakthrough.
A senior Irish official remarked: ''It does not seem likely that there
will be a call for a new date for a peace summit.''
Mr Major arrived within a few minutes of Mr Bruton in Palma.
While the two waited in an airport lounge to be taken by helicopter to
summit HQ in Formentor, they discussed what could be done to break the
logjam caused by the IRA's continued refusal to decommission its arsenal
of guns and explosives.
Later, the two leaders went for a 30-minute ''walk in the woods'' near
their hotel but, according to Irish and British officials, came to no
conclusions. They did, however, instruct senior officials to continue
talking.
The atmosphere of pessimism was lifted only by a statement by the
Irish that Mr Major and Mr Bruton were planning a third meeting before
they left for home.
A spokesman for Mr Major described the walk in the woods as ''a good
private discussion''.
Earlier, Mr Major told reporters: ''If the peace is going to be
permanent then they (the IRA) have no need of an armed force at their
back when they begin to discuss matters with the other constitutional
parties.''

AN amended resolution reaffirming the party's opposition to Scottish
membership of Nato and resolving to work towards the formation of a
''conventionally armed European defensive alliance'' was remitted back
yesterday.
The amended resolution also resolved that no nuclear weapons should be
allowed in Scottish territory, and no foreign military units would be
allowed to be based in Scotland ''without the full consent of the
Scottish parliament''.
The original resolution had stated that conference believed an
independent Scotland should remain a member of Nato, with the two
provisos on nuclear weapons and foreign military units.
During a lengthy debate on the subject one speaker, Mr William Steven,
of the Rutherglen constituency branch, moved that the resolution be
remitted back to a working party and to the council.
He criticised the party's current position on defence -- claiming it
effectively had no defence policy -- and said the matter was too
important to be discussed in a resolution which comprised just two
sentences.

SNP leader Alex Salmond dispelled the doubters in his ranks yesterday
with an impassioned rallying call for independence coupled with a demand
for iron discipline on internal dissent as the party faces the next
General Election.
Delegates suddenly stopped doing what they are usually good at --
falling out over personality clashes and policy differences more
imagined than real. Instead, they responded enthusiastically as their
national convener did what he is not usually considered to be good at --
speaking with passion and power in addition to his customary cleverness.
The relief among senior party aides was evident after the thunderous
ovation which greeted the speech, which was broadcast live throughout
the UK for the first time by the BBC. ''Alex was walking a tightrope
there,'' said one senior figure, ''and he made it across.''
Mr Salmond touched all the right bases, with plenty of populist
''Braveheart'' jibes at the expense of ''the Secretary of State Against
Scotland'' and his Labour shadow. He also made a series of radical pleas
on poverty, education, and nuclear disarmament.
But he also warned delegates: ''We stand on the verge of great things
and if I sometimes seem severe in calling for self-discipline it is
because I know just how close we are now to achieving our goal. To
achieve it will require passion and commitment combined with pragmatism
and iron self-discipline.''
The latter was a pretty fair description of his speech. While not
deviating from his pragmatic insistence that devolution could be a
legitimate secondary route to independence, he laid sufficient emphasis
on the fast track to that ultimate destination to satisfy doubters and
silence critics. Even the most vociferous of those, Renfrew councillor
Jim Mitchell, was generous in his praise afterwards.
''I thought it was a fantastic speech,'' said the outspoken national
executive member. ''He nailed our colours to the mast in terms of
independence and gave the order of the boot to devolution. He allayed
our fears, as long as when we go home there is no dilution of the
message.''
Of Mr Salmond's call for iron discipline from members, Councillor
Mitchell -- who had earlier protested that he had been censored in not
being called to speak in a debate -- said the SNP had ''never been a
party of clones''.
National executive member Iain Lawson, often portrayed as a dissident,
heaped praise on Mr Salmond's performance: ''It was a really strong,
passionate speech, the best conference speech I have ever heard Alex
give. He read the mood of the party.
''It was very much a unifying speech which many in the party will
welcome. In the past, Alex has appeared to lack passion but this time it
was there for all to see.''
0   Mr Salmond must make the return crossing over the tightrope today
as some of his senior supporters contest party posts against those who
remain sceptics about aspects of his leadership. The party cheered him
to the rafters at Perth City Hall yesterday, so it would be no great
surprise if he needed his safety net for today.

HINDUS throughout the world, each one grasping a bottle of milk or its
modern-day equivalent, were yesterday joining queues at temples to pay
homage to a miracle.
They came with their semi-skimmed and their two-litre plastic
supermarket bottles after television cameras seemingly captured stone
statues consuming milk from a spoon.
It all began with one man in a southern suburb of Delhi announcing to
the world that the elephant-headed god Ganesh, the one with the broken
tusk and pot-belly, had consumed his milk. The word soon spread
throughout the world. It also extended to the London Office of The
Herald.
Nutan Rash, sister of Lata Ruparelia, editorial secretary in the
London office, had heard the rumours coming out of India and presented
milk to the gods in the temple in her own home.
She said: ''I didn't believe it would happen, but sure enough when I
presented milk on a spoon to the snakes around the God Lord Shanka it
disappeared within seconds.'' She woke up her sons to witness the
events. ''They could not believe it but it was happening before their
very eyes,'' she said.
Half-a-glass of milk disappeared within half an hour, Nutan insisted.
Lata and her sister yesterday joined the throngs gathering at London's
Southall Hindu Temple. They are convinced that the gods are passing on
an important message to the world.
Some who had earlier visited the temple claimed that they had truly
witnessed a miracle taking place. Others were more sceptical. ''I don't
believe in miracles,'' said one Hindu who had just left. The trouble was
the milk seemed to be disappearing from a spoon and nobody could offer a
sensible explanation as to where it was going.
There are 30 million gods in the Hindu religion. Elephant-headed
Ganesh is by far the most thirsty and the one most likely to sup up the
milk.
However, once the trend began other gods seemed to be joining in. As
in the case of the weeping Madonnas in Ireland, the reports were
spreading like wildfire. Everyone wanted to believe.
''The gods have come down to earth to solve our problems,'' said one
holy man. ''It is just another con trick,'' said someone more secular.
Hundreds queued patiently to witness the phenomenon at the Vishwa
Temple in Southall throughout the day. The temple was forced to open its
large double gates and set up an efficient one-way system as the crowds
queued five deep along the pavement, past semi-detached suburban houses.
As each person knelt down next to the statue and offered it milk on a
spoon the statue appeared to be sucking up half of the liquid. Then the
devotee would tip the remainder into his or her hand and drink it as a
blessing.
The sceptics said much of the milk could be spilling into the sink
underneath and that there was probably a scientific explanation.
The temple chairman, Roshan Lal Bhandari, said he had been telephoned
on Thursday by a friend in India who told him that he had seen a divine
miracle when a statue drank milk.
Mr Bhandari, 60, who is a sub-postmaster and runs a local Indian
restaurant, added that he then saw for himself that the Southall idol
accepted the milk he offered it. ''It is a divine miracle. Our history
books say that wherever evil prevails, incarnation comes.
''Some great soul has come on this earth to remove bondage and evil
and reveal righteousness. It signifies some rising star, a great soul
who has descended on earth.''

A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE National Lottery winner yesterday swapped his
luxurious country manor for a category B prison after he was jailed for
18 months.
Lee Ryan, 32, was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court after he was
convicted in a five-day trial last month of handling three stolen
vehicles -- a Mercedes 500 SEL, a BMW 325i, and a Ford Transit van.
He was ordered to pay #51,000 compensation and #8000 costs. The jury
in the Nottingham Crown Court trial in August was not told of his
jackpot win.
Ryan, usually light-hearted about his court appearances, was in a
serious mood yesterday.He was driven to court and arrived 10 minutes
late.
Dressed in an orange jumper and brown jeans, and with a gold cross
necklace, he walked into court arm-in-arm with his wife Karen. Neither
spoke to reporters.
The pair married in June this year, three months after they shared a
#6.5m lottery jackpot.
Ryan, who is unemployed, had until then lived in a council house in
Braunstone, near Leicester. The couple had shared #120 a week in benefit
payments.
Their windfall brought a colourful spending spree as Ryan satisfied
his taste for luxury, high-performance cars, motorbikes, and even a
helicopter.
His collection of vehicles included a Jaguar XJR, a Ferrari
Testarossa, and a Porsche, as well as two Ducati motorbikes.
His #250,000 JetRanger helicopter is usually parked on the lawn
outside his home in the Leicestershire countryside.
However, it was his attempts three years ago to live the life of a
wealthy man, selling expensive but stolen cars, which brought him to
prison.
As his wife returned to their three children at the manor in Osbaston,
Ryan spent the night at Leicester prison.
Ryan and his co-accused, Darren Richards, 23, denied the charges.
Richards was convicted of handling the stolen BMW and was sentenced to
six months imprisonment but was not ordered to pay compensation.
Ryan had lodged an appeal at the end of the Nottingham trial.
The jury was told the pair took two cars to Malta to sell. Both had
false number plates and forged vehicle registration forms and insurance
cover notes.
At first, the pair planned to sell the cars in Pakistan, where they
thought they could get more profit, but were turned back at the Iranian
border during the Gulf War.
They then drove to Malta and sold the Mercedes for #15,500 and the BMW
for #8500.
The court heard that, when Ryan was arrested, the stolen Ford van was
found outside his home with new licence plates but an old tax disc still
showing the original plate number.
Police found photographs in Richards' home showing the pair in the
stolen cars on their trips to Malta.
Mr Francis Evans, defending Ryan, told the court his client was a
charitable man and had recently given money to the police anonymously to
help solve crimes involving children.
However, Recorder Anthony Palmer QC dismissed Mr Evans' suggestion
that Ryan should serve a community service sentence.
He said: ''These were sophisticated offences of handling which took a
great deal of public money and police time to bring to light. These
offences are so serious that, in my opinion, only a custodial sentence
is justified.''
The court heard Ryan had a string of more than 80 previous
convictions, dating back almost 20 years. It took prosecutor Philip Bown
five minutes to read out the full list at the end of the trial.
Ryan has previously served a three-year prison sentence and has
convictions for car theft.
He is due to be sentenced at Leicester on Monday for contempt of court
after leaping out of the dock and shouting at a judge in a previous
hearing.

Majorca,
THE Prime Minister stoked the flames in international money markets
last night when he backed the Germans' latest attack on the blueprint
for a European single currency.
With weaker currencies in turmoil, Mr Major seized his moment to
lecture EU heads of government on what he called ''an excellent chance
to confront realities''.
His tough speaking at the informal EU summit in Majorca was also
designed to play well at the looming Tory conference in Blackpool, where
Eurosceptics will ambush him for any perceived concessions to faster EU
integration.
Mr Major waded into the EU and its leaders for being more interested
with institutional affairs than the aspirations of ordinary people
chasing jobs and a better life.
His comments were clearly an endorsement of the controversial remarks
made on Wednesday by German finance Minister Theo Waigel, who angered
Italy by saying the lira --still outside the European exchange rate
mechanism with the pound -- would not be fit to be among those first to
form a single currency.
Mr Waigel also cast his shadow over the Belgian franc by suggesting
that the Belgian economy was ''highly indebted''. His comments, made in
private but not denied, have set EU leaders against each other as a
two-speed Europe beckons with weaker currencies being left in the slow
lane of monetary union.
At the same time, Mr Major allied himself with French President
Jacques Chirac, who has called for a study of currencies which remain
outside the single currency -- in a state of so-called ''monetary
cohabitation'' -- which could gain a competitive advantage by devaluing
against the new common money.
The Prime Minister, who negotiated Britain's right to opt out of the
single currency, has always argued that the conditions set by the
Maastricht Treaty for currencies wishing to join the single currency are
unrealistic. This is despite the fact that the pound is likely to be one
of the currencies which will meet the Maastricht convergence criteria.
''Only some states will meet the convergence criteria,'' Mr Major
said. ''But convergence is vital. Without it, the strains on the single
currency would be unsustainable.''
This was more or less the script of Mr Waigel this week, although he
denied that the Germans and the Bundesbank in particular were now trying
to have the Maastricht rules toughened.
''We must consider the EU divided in two camps,'' Mr Major told
President Chirac and the other leaders. ''So far, the debate has been
conducted on the basis of slogans, without economic and political
analysis. But there must be more consideration before irrevocable
decisions are made.''
Attacking the ''rhetoric and dogma'' with which EU discussions were
often carried out, the Prime Minister insisted there should be stricter
conditions for EU future decision-making.
* Shares plummeted in all sectors in a combination of factors
yesterday but particularly growing uncertainty about monetary union.

Scottish Political Correspondent ROBBIE DINWOODIE and KEITH SINCLAIR
report from the Scottish National Party conference in Perth
IT was an address less impressive on paper and in analysis than in its
impact on delegates, a reversal of the usual skills of SNP leader Alex
Salmond which was necessary to win over the faithful and crush
suggestions of divisions.
The sting was in the tail as Mr Salmond gave a stern warning to
delegates after softening them up with the kind of performance they
wanted to hear, full of mockery of their Labour and Conservative enemies
and drawing on the Braveheart theme from the recent William Wallace
movie.
Having got them on his side, Mr Salmond told them some home truths. He
said: ''We stand on the verge of great things and if I sometimes seem
severe in calling for self discipline, it is because I know just how
close we are now to achieving our goal.
''This is not a game. I believe that this party has the ability to
change Scotland and we alone can do that. That is our task. It is more
important than you or me or any person in this hall or any single person
in the whole of Scotland.
''To achieve it will require passion and commitment combined with
pragmatism and iron self-discipline.''
The heads and hearts theme will dominate SNP campaigning in the run-in
to the General Election. Mr Salmond began yesterday -- in an atmosphere
that managed to be both nervous and expectant in the light of repeated
talk of divisions in the party -- by picking on an obvious target, ''the
Secretary of State Against Scotland''. He ridiculed the performance of
both Mr Michael Forsyth and his Labour Shadow Mr George Robertson in
turning up at the premiere of the Wallace movie.
''Michael said Wallace was a fighter for Scottish 'interests'. George
said he fought for Scottish 'identity'. Notice this difficulty with the
'i' word -- the one word they didn't want to mention was independence.''
There was a huge burst of applause as Mr Salmond played a chord which
hit all the right keys.
An education system could fail a nation either by failing to mobilise
human potential or failing to prepare people for gathering change: ''But
it also fails if it does not instil within our young people a sense of
their history, for it is from that that will often spring the
determination to create a better tomorrow.''
It was shameful that Hollywood had to give us back our history and he
said Mr Forsyth and Mr Robertson should worry that the real villains of
the film were not the English but the establishment leadership of
Scotland who bought and sold their country for personal advancement.
He ridiculed the attempts by Mr Forsyth to meddle with Scottish
education by encouraging opt-outs, explaining: ''He believes that the
cohesive nature of the Scottish state system and 97% of pupils included
in it presents a political obstacle in the way of the Conservative Party
and its anti-Scottish, elitist dogma. They meddle to destroy.''
He said Mr Robertson had still failed to answer the question from
their debate earlier this year over what his second choice would be
between independence and the status quo if he couldn't have devolution.
Accusing him of being ''very fragile these days'', Mr Salmond said:
''I had no idea that you were going to get so upset about losing a
debate.
''Why don't you just try harder next time, instead of descending into
the political gutter like you did earlier this week'' -- a reference to
Labour's eve-of-conference attempt to link the SNP to terrorist
organisations.
He criticised the funding arrangements for a devolved assembly as ''a
pocket-money solution for a pocket-money parliament, dangling like a
puppet on Westminster's string''.
Mr Salmond said the SNP's proposals for Scottish government were
costed and pragmatic as well as radical and visionary, and they were
going to win the economic argument for Scottish independence before the
next election.
For the benefit of television viewers seeing such a speech live for
the first time in England and Wales, he said he hoped he was introducing
them to ''a language of politics different from the bland consensus of
London parties''.

TAYSIDE Police were yesterday investigating claims that the Dundee
goalkeeper, Michel Pageaud, threw a pointed net peg towards Hearts fans
during Wednesday's Coca-Cola Cup tie.
A police spokesman confirmed that video footage of the game was being
studied.
He added: ''A complaint has been received and an investigation is
underway.''
A Hearts fan, Mrs Debbie Alison, 31, said that she was left with a cut
and bruised leg after the Frenchman allegedly threw the six-inch peg
into the crowd during the penalty shoot-out at Dens Park which swung the
game in Dundee's favour.
Speaking from her Edinburgh home yesterday, Mrs Alison said: ''It's
not the actual injury that's bothering me, it's the principle. It could
easily have been a child's eye that was hit.
''We called a policeman over and he was about to appeal to the Hearts
fans for witnesses, but he had to go on to the pitch, which had been
invaded by the Dundee fans at the end.''
* Falkirk footballer Steve Kirk was charged by police when a
12-year-old girl was hurt by a ball kicked into the crowd during a
Hearts v Falkirk game at Tynecastle in April.

A SEVENTEEN-year-old soldier has become the second Black Watch recruit
to be shot dead in a training accident.
Private Richard Robertson was shot in the neck during a live-fire
exercise at Bellerby firing ranges, North Yorkshire.
He was taken to the nearby Duchess of Kent Military Hospital at the
Catterick garrison but was pronounced dead on arrival.
His death comes three months after 18-year-old recruit Scott McGregor
died from a single shot during a live-firing exercise at Otterburn, near
Newcastle.
McGregor, from St Vigeans, near Arbroath, was travelling in the back
of a troop carrier on June 2 when a gun went off.
He was a week away from his passing out parade with the Black Watch
regiment.
Yesterday the Army ordered an inquiry into the latest training death.
A spokesman said: ''The circumstances of the shooting are being
investigated. No other person is believed to be involved.''
Robertson's mother and step-father, Linda and Brian Robertson, left
for Yorkshire from the family home at Bankfoot, Perthshire, yesterday
morning.
Last night, the recruit's grandfather, Mr Ian Robertson, said: ''The
whole family is devastated.
''Richard's parent's are at Catterick. We won't know any more until
they arrive back.''
Robertson had been made redundant from a local sawmill a few months
ago. He was due to join the Black Watch after he had finished his
training.
He has a brother, Mark, 11, and sister, Vicki, eight.
A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said there were no suspicious
circumstances.
A family friend, Mr Ian Wallace, said Robertson was a popular and
polite young man who was well known around his home village.
''He was a great outdoor person. He enjoyed working with go-karts
during the summer and he was very keen on his motorbike.

POLICE are investigating the theft of a motorcycle, which is valued at
#11,000, from former Edinburgh solicitor Gordon Thomson.
The Harley Davidson Ultra Classic was taken from the garage at his
home at West Carnethy Avenue, Colinton.
A Lothian and Borders police spokesman said the two-tone red
motorcycle had recently been advertised in an auto trade magazine.
''The owner has had several calls from interested parties and we
cannot rule out the possibility that the thief may have been posing as a
prospective buyer,'' he stated.
Mr Thomson and his wife Maria were struck off by the Scottish
Solicitors Discipline Tribunal in June.

THE epic struggle to reopen a Galloway market town's decayed and
derelict cinema finally got its Hollwood-style happy ending yesterday.
The art deco building in Newton Stewart, which has escaped the
developers' bulldozers three times in the last 25 years, will be
renovated and should reopen for business next year courtesy of a
#341,250 grant from National Lottery funds.
It is the successful end of a sustained campaign stretching back to
1983 when, after mounting losses, it looked like the area's only cinema
had run its last reel.
The local cinema committee then stepped in and ran it on a shoestring
budget for eight years until, faced with enormous costs to meet safety
standards, the cinema was closed.
However, the campaign did not stop and locals, led by newspaper
proprietor Iain Brown, have steadily raised cash and worked towards its
reopening.
Yesterday's award, made through the Scottish Arts Council, will
provide the bulk of the #700,000 needed to return the cinema to its
former glory and unlock cash pledges from various bodies.
Ownership of the cinema will be transferred almost immediately from a
local building firm to the Save The Cinema committee, a delighted Mr
Brown said yesterday, before contractors move in to begin work.
The Newton Stewart cinema grant was one of 17 grants totalling #1.4m
announced by the SAC yesterday with the emphasis on the more accessible
forms of art.
Glasgow Film Theatre (GFT) is to receive #710,000. The grant, in time
for the centenary of the first screening of the moving image in Glasgow
next year, will pay for Cinema One to be upgraded, the foyer to be
improved, and disabled access provided. The once-popular Patron's Bar
will also be reopened.
Ms Lianna Marletta, GFT's development officer, said the new projection
facilities and improved exhibition space would benefit local
film-makers, artists, and photographers.
''We will be installing 16mm projectors, allowing young film-makers to
promote their work and there are plans to reopen the Patron's Bar with
space for exhibitions.''
In Stranraer, Wigtown District Council will be able to instal a cinema
in the Ryan Centre following the decision to award it #31,963 towards
the project.
Other projects funded include the conversion of St Andrew's Parish
Church in Castle Douglas to a fully equipped theatre and new equipment
for Alloa Community Arts Centre.
The arts is one of five good causes supported from the National
Lottery takings and the four UK arts councils are responsible for
distributing lottery proceeds in their own countries.
Chairman of the Scottish Arts Council's lottery committee, Mr Douglas
Connell, said the latest round of awards continued the pattern of
spreading the benefits throughout Scotland.
''It is particularly pleasing to see the south-west of the country
benefiting from three awards which will make a substantial difference to
access to the arts in an area where suitably equipped premises are thin
on the ground,'' said Mr Connell.

POLICE were last night granted a 36-hour extension to continue
questioning Darren Carter-Houndslow, 24, in connection with the death of
15-year-old Naomi Smith.
Two other men were still before Nuneaton magistrates as detectives
applied for similar court extensions.
Five men, all in their mid-twenties and believed to be from the Ansley
Common area of Nuneaton, Warwickshire, where Naomi lived and was killed,
were arrested in a series of raids at their homes on Thursday.
Mr Stephen Millerchip, who represents Mr Carter-Houndslow, said his
client denied any involvement in the death of Naomi, who was found
mutilated and sexually assaulted in a playground near her home, and was
shocked at his arrest.
Police will continue questioning Mr Carter-Houndslow today.
Mr Millerchip said: ''No evidence at all has been put to him, physical
or otherwise. He is extremely calm at the moment and he realises he has
absolutely nothing to worry about.''
But Mr Millerchip said he was angry at the decision by Warwickshire
Constabulary to allow the media to film the arrest of Mr
Carter-Houndslow on Thursday.
He said: ''Pictures of my client leaning against the desk in the
charge room of the police station were shown on national TV. If this
case ever comes to trial, which I doubt it will, this will severely
prejudice the question of identity.
''I was dismayed and very surprised that the press were allowed to
come along at all.''
A second man was released yesterday after being questioned in
connection with the killing of the schoolgirl.
The first man to be released was freed from the station on Thursday.
More than 60 officers are working on the inquiry into the murder of
red-haired Naomi, whom police believe was stabbed and assaulted by
someone she knew.
Earlier, police said they had recovered a number of items from the
homes of the five arrested men.
Detective Superintendent Tony Bayliss, leading the murder inquiry,
said in a statement: ''A number of items recovered from the homes of the
five men arrested yesterday are being examined by scenes of crimes
officers.
''Some of these items will be forwarded to the forensic science
services at Birmingham for further investigations to be carried out.
''A further 12 officers have now been brought in to follow up lines of
inquiry from the interviews conducted yesterday.
''The response from the pubic is continuing at a high level.''
The arrested men are believed to be members of a gang which hung
around the recreation ground where Naomi's body was found lying beneath
a children's slide.
Officers have now completed questioning more than 40 people from the
Ansley Common area. None of them has been charged with any offence.

<FLAG>ANNUAL CONFERENCE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>976240960</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COMPREHENSIVE, and some would claim ambitious, raft of social
policies was launched by the SNP on the third day of its conference in
Perth yesterday.
The package, the aim of which is ''to create a fair and just society''
in Scotland, includes a commitment to the goals of full employment, a
social security system that eradicates poverty, and a ''realistic''
minimum wage.
The resolution, carried unanimously by conference after a lengthy
debate and an amendment to include the provision of child care, was
described by its mover, Mrs Kay Ullrich, as a ''vision'' for an
independent Scotland.
The party's vice-convener, Mr Alex Neil, speaking in support of the
resolution, angrily rejected claims that the SNP was living in a ''dream
world'' in seeking to implement its strategy and said the whole point of
the Nationalist movement was that it had a vision.
The resolution, which states that the SNP recognises it will take a
generation to achieve its objectives, lists the principles governing the
party's approach as a need to overhaul and simplify the benefits system,
eliminate the poverty trap, and make it easier for people to take up
employment.
The key elements of the strategy are:
* A guaranted basic income payment would be paid weekly to all adults
aged 16 and over who are unemployed, retired, disabled, or otherwise
unable to work. Once set, the basic income payment would be increased
annually in relation to national average earnings or the cost of living.
* Additional payments would be made to a range of groups, including
retired people -- bringing pensions into line with the European average
-- disabled people, and the parents of children under 16. Student loans
would also be abolished in favour of index-linked student grants, and
social security entitlements and housing benefits would be restored to
students.
Mrs Ullrich, who was the party's defeated candidate in the Monklands
East by-election, said in moving the resolution: ''Even in a nation of
full employment, which we envisage, provision must be made for those who
are unable to take up employment.
''The benefits system we will inherit is a bureaucratic nightmare. It
is abysmal and not freely accessible and doesn't address people's real
needs.
''If people require support -- short or long term -- we will by the
second term of a Scottish government introduce a basic income below
which no person will be allowed to fall.
''This would be payable to all over 16 unable to take up employment
and, once set, it would be based on average earnings with a relationship
to the minimum wage, and basic income will be the key to reducing the
gap in prosperity between those who can work and those who can't.''
In conclusion, she said the policy was ''about using Scotland's wealth
to create prosperity and social justice''.
Mr Neil, supporting the resolution, said: ''When this conference
agenda was published, we were attacked in the Tory press about living in
a dream world because of this resolution.
''As Kay said, the resolution is a vision and we have built in the
priorities for the first four years. But the whole point of this party
and this movement is that we have the vision.''

'''TIS done,'' he said dramatically, ''as you ordered, 'tis done.''
Mike Russell, the SNP's new chief executive, sat beside me. He has a
maniacal grin and booming vowels.
''Ordered what, exactly?'' I enquired. I could not recall involving
Mike Russell in my plans for total world domination.
''The rostrum,'' said Russell. I learned that, following my send-up of
the ludicrously low conference lectern, it had been quickly rebuilt.
This came as a great relief.
Nationalists have been able to orate in comfort. The City Hall, though
still cramped, has begun to acquire a certain character. It cannot seat
quite everybody for a big conference set piece -- like Margaret Ewing's
speech yesterday -- so, at such moments, the seats are jam-packed and
folk line the walls and throng in doorways and hang from balconies. It's
wonderful. It's like a scene from the French Revolution.
******
JIM Mitchell wants his wine-coloured shoes back. Last year, the wee
Paisleyite left these tasteful items -- almost new -- in his conference
digs at Inverness. They've never been seen since. Apparently a friend
collected them on his behalf. But where are they now? Jim gets nothing
but excuses.
So Jim just wants this guy to know that he's briefed The Herald and,
footwear fiend, we're on your case.
This hasn't been a good day for Jim because he had a nasty rebuff
before lunch. There was a resolution down on the old independence or
devolution controversy, and Jim was desperate to speak.
He wasn't called. Gordon Wilson, sitting in the chair, called so and
so, and so and so, and such and such, and then -- on calling one
Councillor McBore -- announced that this would be the last speech before
the vote. There came an indignant splutter from the front row. Wilson
leaned back in his chair and studied the ceiling with an air of
innocence.
All eyes were on wee Jim, legs pumping, scarf trailing, as he scurried
up to the platform and tried to pull rank on Gordon Wilson.
Mitchell waved his hands. Wilson wagged a finger. Mitchell extended
pitious palms. Wilson stuck up one stern hand like a traffic cop.
Defeated, Mitchell slunk back to the floor and launched a formal point
of order.
''Go to the rostrum, please,'' said Wilson testily, who gets more like
a Church of Scotland Sunday school superintendent every year.
Mitchell went to the rostrum and humbly demanded to be allowed to
speak. He'd put his card in at half past 10.
Wilson said lots of folk put cards in and you could never call them
all. He was sure Councillor Mitchell felt he could make a unique
contribution and he was sure every aspiring speaker felt the same way.
Mitchell demanded an appeal to conference, a suspension of standing
orders, and more time.
A sadistic smile twitched at the corner of Wilson's mouth. ''Well,''
he said, ''you might get it, and the chair might call one or two more
speakers, but the chair may call whatever speakers it sees fit.''
Wilson was now really enjoying himself. He began a droll, leisurely
disposition on what a really interesting situation this may become.
This was too much for senior activist Gerry Fisher. He shot to his
feet. ''Mr Chairman! You are quite out of order.''
''Sit down now, Gerry,'' said Wilson getting bolshie.'' Fisher
crumpled into his seat. ''Well,'' said Wilson, ''might I formally ask
conference if they are prepared to suspend . . . standing orders?''
The blasphemous sound shuddered though the hall. Conference thought
better of it. Mitchell ran off in a huff but lots of journalists ran
after him, so I dare say he soon cheered up.
******
WINNIE Ewing, in introducing Alex Salmond for the leader speech,
remarked that she had never learned what foothall team the great man
supported. ''Hearts,'' said Salmond happily as he took the rostrum to
thunderous applause. The applause broke down into a strange mixture of
wails, sighs, cursing, and muffled cheers. Salmond turned to us at the
press table and beamed. ''Well,'' he said, ''there's your mixed
reception.''

A THIRD man has been found dead of a suspected drugs overdose in the
Saracen area of Glasgow this week.
Fears that contaminated heroin was circulating were sparked earlier
this week when two men died and two others were found unconscious in the
area.
One man was found in a derelict building in Byshot Street and an
eight-year-old boy found three others, one of them dead, collapsed amid
drug-taking equipment in a lane off Saracen Street on Tuesday.
Police are still trying to identify the man whose body was found at
about 3.30pm yesterday near Balmore surgery, in Balmore Road, Glasgow.
He is described as in his early to late 20s, 5'9'' tall, with brown,
collar-length hair. He was wearing a green and cream hooped sweatshirt,
black jeans, and white training shoes.
