From PATRICK BROGAN
Washington, Monday
THE troubles of Newt Gingrich over his links to Rupert Murdoch
continue. The Wall Street Journal reports today that the main purpose of
a meeting between the two men last November was to enlist the new
Speaker's help in frustrating an attack on Mr Murdoch's Fox television
network by a rival.
Mr Murdoch was accompanied at the meeting by Fox's Washington
lobbyist, Preston Padden. He told the Journal that the meeting lasted 18
minutes, and that two minutes at the end were devoted to discussing
Fox's problems.
That does not sound much, but people as experienced as Rupert Murdoch
and Newt Gingrich can make themselves understood quickly. The rival TV
network, NBC, has sued Fox in the Federal Communications Commission,
claiming that it is owned by a foreign entity, Murdoch's News
Corporation, and thus violates American law.
The rule is that no foreign entity can own more than 25% of an
American TV company. Mr Murdoch argues that since he is an American
citizen and controls News Corp, the rule has not been broken.
It is quite normal for a big corporation to lobby Congress on such a
matter, as NBC has been doing. However, a few days after the meeting
between the Speaker and the media mogul, one of Mr Murdoch's publishing
companies, HarperCollins, offered Mr Gingrich $4.5m (#3m) as an advance
on two books.
Mr Gingrich gave up the advance just after Christmas, on the grounds
that it had the appearance of impropriety: but the matter is not
settled.
The latest criticism centres on one of the books, an anthology of
important conservative political texts. Mr Gingrich has agreed that
instead of an advance, HarperCollins will give him editorial help in
preparing the two books. If this means the publisher prepares the
anthology, Mr Gingrich will be paid for work he has not done.
That would violate the House code of ethics, just the charge Mr
Gingrich himself used against an earlier Speaker, Jim Wright, who was
driven from office because a publisher had paid him far more than he
deserved for a book. It looked very like bribery, and ruined Mr Wright.
The Democrats are baying at Newt Gingrich's heels, just as he bayed at
Jim Wright's five years ago. No doubt he will escape them this time, but
the loss of the advance will cost him a lot of money.
So why did HarperCollins offer such a large advance that the books
were not likely to pay back? Could it have anything to do with Mr
Murdoch's legal problems? Two Republican Congressmen had proposed Bills
to repeal the inconvenient rules and Mr Gingrich could certainly help to
ensure they were passed. That would have been well worth $4.5m.
Mr Murdoch and Mr Gingrich both insist that there was no question of a
quid for a quo: Mr Murdoch only learned of the book deal after it was
publicly announced.
Now, however, the deal has come unravelled, and it is entirely
possible that the Federal Communications Commission will feel pressure
to interpret the rule strictly. Mr Gingrich will not help, and Mr
Murdoch may have to restructure Fox, moving its ownership, perhaps the
whole News Corp, to the United States.
That would cost him a great deal of money. All because a piece of
discreet lobbying became public.

A MISTAKE by former Celtic defender Chris Morris proved costly for
Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park last night when the English Division 1
leaders made their exit from the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat against
Cardiff.
Morris's error after 21 minutes allowed Steve Torpey to open the
scoring for the Welsh side, and close to the hour mark, David Penney
added a second. John Hendrie reduced the arrears, but it was too little,
too late.
Bryan Robson, the Middlesbrough manager, was disappointed. ''We didn't
deserve anything,'' he said. ''We kept giving the ball away and our
crossing was poor.''
Division 3 leaders Carlisle could not cope with Sunderland at Brunton
Park, the visitors winning 3-1, while South African Phil Masinga hit an
extra-time hat trick for Leeds after Walsall, of Division 3, had twice
come from behind at Elland Road.
Masinga's goals made it 5-2 for United, who now have a home tie
against first division Oldham.
* MORTON had to wait until 17 minutes from time before Marko Rajamaki
drilled home a magnificent equaliser, and then seven minutes into extra
time, Derek Lilley's close-range effort gave them a 2-1 Scottish Cup
victory against Queen's Park.
The home team were shocked eight minutes into the tie when Queen's
took the lead. Ferguson hit a long ball out of defence and home keeper
Wylie raced from goal to clear. However, Ross Caven followed up to lob
the ball home.
Just before the interval Queen's were denied a penalty when a
McGoldrick header appeared to be deflected wide by an arm of McCahill.
Queen's defence held out until Rajamaki pounced 17 minutes from time.
* TWO-GOAL John Dickson earned the points for Clyde in a 2-0 victory
against Stirling Albion.
A strong wind marred this re-scheduled league match and Dickson's
second goal seven minutes from time was an example of the conditions.
The Clyde forward's cross-cum-shot increased in pace and beat keeper
Mike Monaghan.
Dickson netted the opener in 68 minutes when he fastened on to a
knock-back from Jamie McCarron to shoot home.
* ANDY Kennedy, the former Rangers striker, could play for Falkirk
reserves tomorrow night against his old club if he can free himself in
time from a contract with Irish club Portadown.
Kennedy wants to return to Scotland, and living close to Brockville is
seeking training facilities there.
* MIKE Galloway, of Celtic, has joined Leicester City on a month's
loan.
* RANGERS, the BP Youth Cup holders, have been drawn at home to Dundee
United in the quarter-finals of this season's competition. Draw:
Airdrie v St Johnstone, Clydebank v Hearts, Rangers v Dundee United,
Celtic v Aberdeen.

IN the late 1950s, when Jim Clark drove a Lotus Elite at Brands Hatch,
and in 1960 when he had a Lotus 18 at Charterhall, his exploits carved
the marque on the envious heart of every pre-yuppie British male.
But the black flag fell yesterday when financial pressures forced Team
Lotus off track, its workforce redundant. They will have no Formula One
team on the circuit for the first time since 1958.
Clark's style had that quality, elan, which the company adopted as the
name of their award-winning sports model, launched in 1962. But the
enthusiasm for the Berwickshire farmer's sports-car success was only a
warm-up lap for the passions he aroused from '62 to '68, when he drove
the evolutionary first monocoque machine, the Lotus 25, and then the
subsequent 33, 43, and 49 models to a then record 25 grands prix wins.
Before he died in 1968, at the wheel of a Lotus Cosworth, in a Formula
2 race on a gloomy April Sunday after having punctured and skidding off
the track at Hockenheim, Clark had won two world championship titles.
But by then he had founded a dynasty which attracted the very best
drivers, including Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna.
It was Senna who secured their last grand prix success, at Detroit in
1987, using the company's innovation, active suspension, which
subsequently revolutionised the sport.
After Clark's death, Graham Hill won the 1968 title, and Lotus was
driven to further championships by Jochen Rindt (1970), Emerson
Fittipaldi (1972), and Mario Andretti (1978). They won the constructors'
title in 1963, '65, '68, '70, '72, '73, and '78, but Andretti's win in
1978 signalled the end of the principal glory days.
There were to be no more wins until 1982, and in December of that year
founder Colin Chapman died of a heart attack, at the age of 54. It was a
blow from which his company never really recovered. There were
allegations surrounding $17.65m which went missing, in relation to the
ill-fated de Lorean sports car, with which Lotus was heavily involved,
and the Inland Revenue blocked probate on Chapman's estate before
winning a complex court action.
Senna gave them some sporadic wins in the three years after his
arrival in 1985, and Scottish aristocrat Johnny Dumfries also drove
briefly with the team during this time.
Lotus, which Chapman founded in 1952, blossomed quickly, taking just
six years to get to the F1 starting grid, and his innovative and
revolutionary chassis construction and body design were rapidly followed
by his rivals.
But Chapman established Lotus at that level by the sheer force of his
personality as much as his engineering brilliance -- and a ruthless
streak. The livery enjoyed its first success thanks to a Scot, Innes
Ireland, who won at Watkins Glen in 1961.
But Chapman ditched the dashing Ireland to sign Berwickshire farmer
Clark.
Ireland did not forget. He baulked and chopped Clark's Lotus in future
races, notably at Monza, in 1964. But Clark sucked Dan Gurney into the
fray, and left the two of them standing. Ireland forgave only after
Clark's death, when, as editor of an auto magazine, he penned a poignant
tribute.
Whether on track, rally, or in sports car racing, Clark and Lotus
seemed inseparable. He drove a Lotus Cortina into eighth place in the
1966 RAC Rally, before wrapping it around a tree.
There were wins in Lotus Cortinas, Elites, Elans, Fords, and many
others. It was a rear-engined Lotus Ford which Clark piloted to victory
in the 1965 Indy 500, at an average speed of 150mph. That was only his
second attempt at the race, and he was the first UK winner.
And when Clark drove his green and gold Lotus to victory at the South
African Grand Prix for his twenty-fifth victory, it surpassed Juan
Fangio's record number of grands prix wins.
Lotus almost went broke at the end of 1990. But Peter Collins,
formerly of Benetton, and Peter Wright, stepped in to rescue them.
Last October the team was bought by David Hunt, brother of the late
former world champion, James. It had been placed in the hands of
administrators the previous month with liabilities approaching #10m.
Hunt still hopes to find support, but Lotus has withered. The debt sign
proved a no-through road as he sought fresh backers.

Brian Meek views with disdain
the assumption that Scotland
will be the recipient of the
Wooden Spoon. Fired by this
he makes a bold prediction.
NOT a ball has been kicked and Scotland has already been awarded the
Wooden Spoon in the Five Nations Championship. In every one of those
London-based Sundays and cut-price Mondays it is all about whether Will
and the chaps in white can play to their potential and see off the
French.
Wales, we are told, might just make it into third spot, national pride
and all that, and the ould Irish front row, the most fearsome trio since
the Clancey brothers, will guarantee that Scotland will be holding up
the table yet again.
We are even informed that our international team consists of a bunch
of ''semi-Scots'', of whom Eric Peters, born in Glasgow, is listed as
one. That is pretty rich coming from an English source.
I had a check through the birth-places of the England squad who came
to Murrayfield last season. They included Tony Underwood, born Ipoh,
Malaysia, Kyran Bracken (Dublin), Victor Ubogu (Lagos, Nigeria), Mike
Catt (Port Elizabeth, South Africa), Dewi Morris (Crickhowell, Wales),
and Steve Ojomoh (Benin City, Nigeria) -- a real little United Nations.
No matter. Let us not be sidetracked by the old chestnut of
eligibility. When a player pulls on the jersey of any country in this
competition he will give his all.
But, if I were Scotland team manager Duncan Paterson, or much-critised
coaches Duncan Morgan and Richie Dixon, these forecasts of doom and
gloom would be stored, maybe even posted in the dressing-room at
Murrayfield. One of the great satisfactions of sport is proving people
wrong.
A former chairman of selectors Lex Govan, with whom I was having a jar
on Saturday, once took a cutting of mine into a Scotland dressing-room.
''He says you have little chance of winning,'' he told the team, ''and
that if you lose the selectors should resign.
''It is one thing for him to attack you lot, calling for our heads is
something different.'' Scotland beat Wales and I had humble pie for
dinner.
The Five-Nations Championship is in my book the most glorious sporting
event of the winter, a three month celebration of the game of rugby
football. Forget all the nonsense about this being a World Cup
rehearsal, it is a competition which rightly stands on its own laurels.
Would a Grand Slam or a Triple Crown be in any way devalued because it
was achieved in a World Cup year? Don't be ridiculous.
Those who love this game revel in the Five Nations. In the car-parks
at Murrayfield and Twickenham, in the pubs of Dublin and Cardiff, in the
vast amphitheatre of the Parc des Princes you will find supporters of
every competing country thoroughly enjoying themselves. That, remember,
is what sport is supposed to be all about.
Maybe England will scoot to victory. They have class in a back
division made even silkier by the return of Jeremy Guscott. Their huge,
yet mobile forwards are the envy of everybody. One would always choose
Rob Andrew to take the match-winning kick.
Yet, with much the same squad, they made a total rickets of it last
season. Will their confidence, and their nerve hold if Ireland, in the
shape of Simon Geoghegan, the sprinting dervish, run in a try against
them early doors in Dublin on Saturday? Your Irish front row is good,
Peter Clohessy a prop made from girders it would seem. Brendan Mullin is
back and much faith is being placed in new fly-half Paul Burke.
To be sure, they performed badly in Australia and indifferently
against the United States. That cuts no turf when it comes to playing
England.
France look considerably menacing. They have now added patience to
their repertoire, Philippe Saint-Andre is a respected captain and
Philippe Sella, a 102 caps legend.
I doubt if Wales, who I saw lose too honourably to South Africa will
be able to rattle their cage in Paris this week. The Welsh team
announcements are like casuality bulletins and, even with Robert Jones
restored, they may struggle all season.
In passing may I make another plea to stop ''double-headers'' in the
Five Nations. Ireland against England should be played on Saturday and
Wales versus France on Sunday, or the other way round. Rugby needs the
exposure and, as was shown in the last World Cup, supporters are happy
to roll up on Sundays.
Scotland, of course, sit out the first round of the championship,
being occupied by the visit of the Canadians on Saturday. Nothing less
than a convincing victory over them will be entirely satisfactory.
I do not believe there is all that much wrong with this Scottish team,
nor that they are a class behind the rest. But we are a small nation and
injuries, losing Gary Armstrong and Andy Nicol at the same time is
cruel, hit us hardest.
Even so we have a side which includes the exciting talents of Craig
Joiner, Kenny Logan and Gregor Townsend in the back division while the
pack has key figures in Rob Wainwright, Damian Cronin and Iain Morrison.
No, Gavin Hastings is not finished as I expect the big man will
demonstrate. Craig Chalmers is another determined customer and those who
write off Scott Hastings do so at their peril.
Scotland are never going to throw the ball around with gay abandon at
international level but they might be expected to play with a bit more
variety.
Yes, I will put the neck on the block. Scotland will beat Ireland and
Wales at home and head for Twickenham on March 18 in search of a Triple
Crown.
Pin that prediction on the wall, too.
* ANDY Macdonald, the Heriot's lock, is out of the Scotland 'A' team
to meet their French counterparts at Hughenden on Friday. He has a
''dead'' leg and is replaced by Robb Scott of London Scottish.
Scott's place on the bench will be taken by Hawick's Derek Turnbull.

DREW Docherty, the British bantamweight champion from Condorrat, last
night told of how a punch-up with young brother, Wilson, almost
shattered his world-title ambitions and, as a precaution, he will have a
medical check-up today.
Drew, scheduled to meet Ghana's WBO champion Alfred ''The Cobra''
Kotey at Cumbernauld on February 17, cut short a sparring session with
Wilson at Croy Miners' Club on Monday after he suffered bad bruising
around the nose.
Wilson Docherty will meet Paisley's Michael Deveney for the vacant
British featherweight title at the St Andrew's Sporting Club in Glasgow
on Monday night and was warming up with a spar.
Said Drew: ''The nose is badly bruised. I don't think it is broken but
I will have it checked out in the morning. I was still able to train
tonight, although I obviously didn't do any sparring.
''I can assure everyone Wilson is in great shape for his British title
fight. If he can belt me like that, then Michael Deveney had better
watch out.''
* RAY Close was still shocked yesterday by the blow which cost him the
chance of a third meeting with WBO super-middleweight champion Chris
Eubank at the King's Hall, Belfast, on February 11. The Irishman's
licence has been suspended after a brain scan showed abnormalities.
WBO middleweight champion Steve Collins, from Dublin, steps in to
fight Eubank.
* DAVE Anderson, awaiting a British lightweight title shot, is to meet
Spain's Carlos Javier Pena Lopez at Glasgow's SECC on Saturday on the
bill headed by European bantamweight champion Naseem Hamed.

Has Ross Finlay found the perfect car?
MERCEDES offers more versions of the E-class -- in saloon, estate,
coupe and cabriolet styles -- than any of its other model lines. At
prices from #21,610 to #54,450 they are strong contenders in the
executive, sport and luxury sectors of the market, although many
features which other manufacturers provide as standard are on the
Stuttgart extra-cost options list. However, Mercedes residuals are the
envy of the industry. In one all-makes list of likely values after
30,000 miles or so, the stand-out winner is the E250 diesel.
Essentially conservative, Mercedes retains features some of us feel
are rather stodgy. For instance, the entry models usually struggle in
performance terms to match their direct rivals, because of their hefty
weight to power ratio, and Mercedes does not make the slightest effort
to follow trends in fascia styles and layout. But when you drive any
Mercedes for a fair distance, there is a feeling of inner strength,
engineering integrity and long-term reliability.
After all, Mercedes traces its history right back to the very first
petrol-engined car which ever took the road. What it offers, more than
anything else, is maturity, both as a company and in the cars it builds.
Engine design is always a strong point. Petrol units for the E-class
start with a 136bhp two-litre and progress via 2.2 and 2.8 to a
3.2-litre size. The magnificent E500 saloon, powered by a five-litre V8
producing 308bhp, finished its limited production run three months ago.
There are also two noteworthy diesel engines, with which Mercedes
introduced multi-valve operation to this part of the market.
While most E-class cars seen here are the saloons and estates, I have
been driving an E36 AMG coupe. The E36 specification is available on all
body styles. AMG is a tuning and special equipment company founded in
1967 by Hans Werner Aufrecht. In 1971 it prepared a majestic 6.8-litre
Mercedes 300 SEL which was the most powerful racing saloon car in
Europe. More recently, an AMG Mercedes won the German Touring Car
Championship contested by the most highly modified racing saloons of the
present day.
However, AMG is not just a competition shop. It has a close business
link with Mercedes, and the E36 cars it modifies for the showroom
catalogue are sold via Mercedes dealers, keeping the full manufacturer's
warranty.
Basic cost of the E36 coupe is #48,700, but the test car's options put
the price up to #54,683. Performance with the tuned 272bhp 3.6-litre
engine is really vivid for what is still a heftily built car. Even with
the standard automatic transmission, the coupe sprints to 60mph in seven
seconds, has massive mid-range torque, and goes on to a claimed 155mph
test track limit. You can feel that this is, however flexible, an engine
built by racing people from the determined note it produces as revs in
the intermediate gears head for the red line. Lower-down acceleration is
formidable, and the optional wheelspin control certainly does work. I
felt its restraining effect a couple of times when I leant too hard on
the throttle on dampish roads.
You might expect the sport suspension to be rock solid, but one of the
most impressive things about the E36 set up, and the wide, low profile
Bridgestone Expedia tyres fitted by AMG, is that while the car's
handling is right on the pace with its performance, the ride quality
remains remarkably good. The automatic transmission is excellent,
slurring easily through its changes, but I would have enjoyed driving
the E36 even more if it had not had such a ridiculously big steering
wheel.
Mercedes has a fine reputation for its executive and luxury saloons
and estates, but there are many performance car enthusiasts lurking
within the company. Sometimes their activities are restricted, but right
now they seem to be well to the fore again, as last year's Indianapolis
500 victory with the Penske team, this year's return to Grand Prix
racing with McLaren, and the impressive E36 range all make clear.

YOU can transform your central heating to a modern, efficient system
by upgrading the boiler and control systems -- a cost-effective way of
being warmer this winter while cutting down fuel bills. Or you can have
a brand new central heating system installed, surrounding yourself with
comfort for the rest of the winter without breaking the bank.
''Home has become the main focus for leisure, and because being warm
and comfortable is such a nice feeling, people are increasingly aware of
how an efficient and controllable central heating system adds to their
sense of well-being during our harsh winters,'' said interior design
expert Rosa Kerr.
A graduate of Glasgow School of Art, Rosa now runs a London-based
consultancy specialising in advising manufacturers and housebuilders on
consumer trends. ''At one time families gathed round the hearth in the
evening, but now, with the diverse range of leisure activities pursued
at home, every room in the house can be adequately heated by convenient,
controllable central heating. To make the most of winter evenings in a
cosy home, efficient central heating is a modern necessity. Fortunately,
it is also likely to be the most cost-effective way to heat your home.''
The best central heating systems are designed around the lifestyle of
the family, in contrast to early systems which were based on a standard
pattern. A good specialist firm will tailor-make a system to suit your
individual requirements. The factors which are taken into account will
include how many hours each day your home is occupied. If there's always
someone at home, then a solid fuel system could be a good choice, but if
everyone is out at work for most of the day then gas, oil or electricity
which can be turned on and off at the flick of a switch -- will make a
more suitable choce. Whichever fuel you choose, you can have a welcoming
living flame fire to provide a glowing focal point throughout the cold,
wet and gloomy winter days.
''Homeowners now have a superb range of fireplaces to choose from,
some modern and some excellent reproductions of Victorian styles,'' Rosa
Kerr said. ''Beautifully elegant and stylishly authentic down to the
last detail, they are indistiguishable from real coal and log fires and
help create the ideal setting for a winter night at home.'' Unlike
previous generations, we can enjoy the warmth and pleasure of a
flickering fire on a cold winters day without the trouble of fetching
the coal or emptying the ashes. And with modern central heating systems,
you can divide your home into separately heated time zones with a
sophisticated elctronic control system. Your central heating system will
also deliver a stream of constant, easily controlled hot water for
showers and baths.
If your boiler is struggling to get through the winter, consider
replacing it with a modern condensing boiler which is compact and much
cheaper to run. British Gas offer a choice of modern, space-saving
boilers that are so much more efficient than traditional boilers. The
latest technology is used to recover more heat from flue gases. In fact,
with a new condensing boiler you could make big savings on your heating
bill, particularly important with VAT on fuel due to increase in April.
Thermostatically controlled valves help you choose the temperature
where you want it, when you want it. If you choose to have
thermostatically controlled valves fitted, you can set the temperature
on individual radiators. So, for every part of your house -- room by
room, you can enjoy real extra comfort. And by having more control over
your heating, it could also go a long way to reducing the cost of your
fuel bills.
You can have your present system modernised by replacing the boiler,
and adding radiators and more sophisticated controls, or choose an
entirely new system at an economical cost by using a reputable
specialist central heating company.
Several companies specialise in systems which combine the latest
technology in central heating performance with the traditional appeal of
a focal point fire. All good specialist companies will emphasise the
importance of insulation in achieving the standard or comfort and fuel
economy which you expect from a top class central heating system.
''Remember that the walls of your home lose most heat, and must be
insulated, and that loft insulation is one of the cheapest and most
effective home improvements you can make,'' said Rosa Kerr. ''The rated
output of most central heating systems is only guaranteed by the
manufacturer if the home is properly insulated, and mony spent on
insulation will be quickly recouped in reduced fuel bills.''

ONE of the biggest events in the bridal calendar -- barring a bride's
own big day -- is about to hit town. Roberta Buchan's famous wedding
exhibition is this year being held in the Glasgow Hilton on Sunday,
January 22.
A phenomenal 1500 visitors turned out for the event last year and at
least as many are expected for the 1995 wedding exhibition. Undoubtedly
one of the foremost bridal fayres in the country, it attracts visitors
from the windy shores of Wick and even from England. This year,
according to Roberta Buchan, it has the distinction of a double first --
the first wedding exhibition to be held in the first five- star hotel in
Glasgow.
Said Roberta: ''Brides-to-be obviously want their big day to be just
perfect, but getting it that way can be like a military operation and
people do need expert help. Buying the dress isn't the end of it, there
are the accessories to consider and the after sales service too. It is
important for brides to know that all the bits and pieces will be there
and ready for the occasion.
''People come from all over to the wedding exhibition and it is a
fabulous event -- a real must for anyone who is marrying this year.''
The bridal gowns themselves tend to be the main attraction on display
as part of the fashion shows, but over and above the clothes there will
be a good range of stalls for any bride wanting advice on a myriad of
questions in the run-up to her wedding.
Companies taking part in the event include Top Tier Cakes, Reflections
Video, photographers Sharp of Hamilton, Macdonald Mackay kiltmakers,
videomakers Style, Aries Flowers, Rosetti, Stockwell China Bazaar, the
Neil Drover entertainment agency, Silver Choice Car Hire, Lightbody the
Bakers, Strang the Jewellers, Bonnyton Designs with their arrangements
of dried flowers, photographer Gordon McGowan, printers John McCormick
and Strathclyde Financial Services.
Such is the prestige of the event that Anneka Borman, editor of Brides
magazine, is flying up to Glasgow specially and she will be available to
answer bridal questions on anything from matters of etiquette to what
makes the best bridal backdrop for photographs. The occasion will also
provide a chance for those who are unacquainted with the hotel to check
round the Hilton and its facilities.
For Roberta Buchan, the past few months have seen a few changes with a
major redevelopment of the shop at 176 Hope Street in Glasgow though
Roberta fans can rest assured that the same wide spread of choice and
prices have been maintained. As ever at Roberta Buchan, you will find
Scotland's largest selection of bridal wear -- with more than 400
different styles in stock.New at the shop is the recently opened
Occasion Wear on the ground floor, which is completely dedicated to
outfits for the mother of the bride or groom and wedding guests with of
course accessories that can be dyed to match.
Tickets for the wedding exhibition, which will run from 12 noon until
6pm on Sunday, are available from the Hope Street shop and at the Hilton
on the day though with the numbers expected it may be advisable to get
them beforehand.
Catwalk show
THE highlight of the Roberta Buchan wedding exhibition is undoubtedly
the fashion shows. This year there will be three catwalk parades at 1pm,
2.30pm and 4pm, showcasing an astonishing 80 or so outfits for the
bride, bridesmaids, flower girls, pages, and wedding guests.
Among the outfits there will certainly be a number of showstoppers,
but the gowns have been selected to range over the price spectrum,
purposely to allow brides-to-be to get an idea of what is available
whether they have #200 or #2000 to spend.
Choice and catering for the individual is very much a hallmark of the
Roberta Buchan bridal salon, but as one of the judges of last year's
annual bridal awards in London alongside Jeff Banks, she has a fair idea
of the current trends.
Said Roberta: ''Today's bride looks for elegance in all areas of her
life, whether she is decorating a new home or buying an electrical
appliance. The wedding dress is a natural extension of this aesthetic
appreciation. Today's bride has a maturity and confidence. She is an
Audrey Hepburn, but of our time -- sleek, but with an obvious charm and
softness which is irresistible.''

THE Scottish Office said yesterday that it would give no grant aid to
the potential new owners of the failed HCI private hospital, Clydebank,
the Abu Dhabi Investment Company, unless they succeeded in providing a
further 1450 local jobs.
The statement followed a demand that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang be
recalled to give further evidence to the Commons Select Committee on
Scottish Affairs as a result of reports that his department is planning
to offer a #4.4m ''sweetener'' to the Arab company to go ahead with the
takeover.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson wrote to committee chairman
Mr William McKelvey, Labour MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, calling for
the MPs to investigate ''the bizarre revelations'' that more taxpayers'
money was about to go to the Abu Dhabi company.
The Scottish Office offered up to #22m in Regional Selective
Assistance to the original owners of HCI on condition that it created
1800 permanent jobs in the area. So far, #17.6m has been paid out and
only 350 jobs created.
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ''There is no question of any cash
on top of what was orginally on offer to HCI.
''The possibility of paying out the balance of RSA already offered to
the project (#4.4m) is a matter for negotiation and would certainly be
dependent on the creation of the 1450 further jobs.''
Mr Robertson in his letter said the Abu Dhabi company planned to take
over the #180m hospital for a third of what it cost to build.
''HCI is being sold for a song,'' he said.
''The buyers will inherit a state-of-the art hospital without any debt
burden. It would be indefensible if another #4.4m was to be used as a
sweetener for what is already a bargain basement sell off.
''The issue here is not whether or not existing jobs at Clydebank are
protected. The issue is whether the taxpayer is getting value for money
in any sell-off.
''It is now clear that Ian Lang has told only part of the story. He
should come clean and tell the Scottish people precisely how much this
is going to cost them.''

PROPOSALS for a national identity card will be announced in the
spring, Downing Street said yesterday -- after confidential Cabinet
papers on the plan turned up in a junk shop.
Ministers still are discussing the feasibility of introducing the
''smart cards,'' and a green paper will go out for consultation in the
next few months, a spokesman said.
''The objective is to come up with a green paper, a consultation
document, in the spring. But it's not ready yet.'' Meanwhile, the
Cabinet Office said it would launch an inquiry if secret papers about ID
cards which turned up at a junk shop in Camden Town, north London, were
genuine.
The papers included a memo to the Prime Minister, the suggested design
of the card, a 17-page report on the plan and details of a key Cabinet
option for the cards.
They were found in a second-hand filing cabinet, according to a report
in the Guardian.
A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ''If they were authenticated as
Cabinet papers, then of course we would initiate an inquiry.''
Civil rights groups fiercely oppose introduction of a national
identity card which they see as the tool of a ''Big Brother'' police
state.
The Cabinet papers show that last May Ministers opposed introducing
national identity cards.
However, Home Secretary Michael Howard changed his mind, after finding
public opinion much more favourable to the idea of a card than in the
past.

THE Government held to its line last night over plans to change the
rules on the so-called right to silence in Scottish courts.
As the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill continued its committee stage
in the House of Lords, a number of peers expressed concern that
Government proposals to allow the prosecution to comment on an accused's
right to silence went too far.
One Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Hutchinson of Lullington, argued that
the Government might be ''adding to the scales of justice so that they
sink on the side of conviction,'' while his colleague, Lord Wigoder,
said the Government was on a ''slippery slope''.
From the Labour Front Bench, Lord Macaulay of Bragar put forward the
argument that the Scottish legal system had to have effective safeguards
if miscarriages of justice were to be avoided.
The burden of proof must always rest on the Crown, and any attempt to
use the absence of the accused from the witness box as evidence
supporting the Crown case could undermine the rights of the accused.
Lord Macaulay urged the Government to think again, warning that if the
prosecution went ''over the top,'' the defence might be tempted to press
for a retrial, at further public expense.
The Government's line, supported by senior Scottish Judge and
crossbench peer Lord McCluskey, was that the new powers would be used
with restraint, and merely provided a level playing-field.
The Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, told the House: ''The
fact that an accused person has not given evidence will be obvious to
the court. It is likely to be commented on by the defence in its summing
up, it may be commented on by the judge, and it may be taken into
account by the jury when it considers its verdict.
''It is therefore illogical that of those present the prosecutor alone
is prohibited from commenting.''
He pointed out that the prosecutor would be able to comment only with
restraint in particular circumstances.
However, Lord Macaulay warned that the Government was opening the door
for an ''evidential free-for-all,'' contrary to the interests of
Scottish justice.
While he withdrew a Labour amendment stating that ''where the accused
did not give evidence such action shall be of no evidential value,'' he
warned that Labour was likely to return to the matter at a later stage.
Also last night, Labour pressed for abolition of the ''not proven''
verdict in Scottish courts, on the grounds that it had become outdated
and left the accused in ''a sort of judicial limbo''.
However, Lord Rodger said there had been wide consultation on the
matter, and two out of three responses had supported its retention. ''We
have come to the view that the verdict does operate satisfactorily and
that therefore it would be wrong to remove it from the legal system.''
The Government remained unreceptive to Lord McCluskey's proposals that
victims of crime should have the right, enshrined in law, to be
consulted on the punishment meted out to offenders.
Scottish Offfice Minister Lord Fraser of Carmyllie stood by the line
that the present system meant that enough relevant information already
was brought to the attention of the courts, though he acknowledged that
perrhaps more information could be provided to victims about the
progress of cases in which they were involved.
Lord McCluskey later denied he was a ''hanger and flogger or tattooer
or putter of people in chains''. He said a speech of his had been
''condensed by someone at the Press Association and I was embarrassed to
find myself being praised by the Sun newspaper.''
One amendment accepted by the Government last night was that the
Government will publish an annual report on the performance of people
engaged in the criminal justice system in Scotland, monitoring their
duty to avoid discriminating against anyone on the grounds of race.

<HEADLINE>Major in bid to placate Ulster Unionists</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980320381</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DOWNING Street yesterday moved to placate Ulster Unionists -- who are
threatening to withdraw their support for the Government -- by insisting
there were no plans for joint authority in Ireland.
Senior Ulster Unionists have warned that they would stop backing John
Major's Government if Ministers agreed to set up cross-border
institutions in Ireland -- a move which could cause a General Election.
They are concerned that London is on the verge of compromise with
Dublin over new bodies spanning north and south.
The two Governments are engaged in talks over a joint framework
document on the way they see the Northern Ireland peace process
developing.
However, a Downing Street spokesman said yesterday: ''As both the
British and Irish governments have confirmed, there's no question of the
framework document coming forward with proposals that would involve
either joint sovereignty or joint authority.
''That is not on the agenda. Dick Spring has said that. The Prime
Minister has said that.''
Ulster Unionists are fiercely opposed to any move which would give
Dublin any shred of influence over the north.
However, Downing Street stopped short of ruling out cross-border
authorities with executive powers which the Unionists see as tantamount
to joint authority.
The No. 10 spokesman said the two Governments were preparing a
consultation document which would be open for constitutional parties to
debate. Mr Major hoped ordinary citizens also would express their views
on it.
Meanwhile, Mr Martin McGuinness claimed last night that the
decommissioning of IRA weapons is not a Government precondition for Sinn
Fein being involved in all-party talks on Northern Ireland's future.
He made the claim after leading a Sinn Fein team to the third session
of discussions with Government officials.
However, the Northern Ireland Office said that while it was not a
precondition it was a reality -- no-one else would take part in talks
with Sinn Fein until the issue had been dealt with.
Mr McGuinness said he was ''still very hopeful about the peace
process''.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday refused to give details of what,
if any, security cover he had during his visits to the Paisley flood
sites between Christmas and New Year ''on security grounds.''
On one visit, he drove himself to Paisley unaccompanied by officals or
a police escort, and giving just an hour's notice to local MPs Mr Gordon
McMaster and Mrs Irene Adams.
Mr McMaster used his own car to drive the Secretary of State around
the town and commented at the time that ''it was all very cloak and
dagger''. Strathclyde police later said they were aware of Mr Lang's
movements, but declined to comment further.
The Scottish Office said it was up to Mr Lang to decide whether an
engagement would be publicly announced, in which case he would travel
with the usual retinue of officials and security or to make a visit
privately.

<HEADLINE>Premier exploits Labour rail 'muddle'.    Train drivers' union seeks talks to clear up Opposition position on privatisation</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister yesterday poured scorn on what he described as
''the muddle'' of Labour's plans for the railways.
The Opposition denied that the party's deputy leader Mr John Prescott
-- by remarks in a radio interview -- had contradicted his earlier
pledge to bring any part of the network which is privatised under public
ownership.
Meanwhile, train drivers' union leaders are seeking urgent talks with
Shadow Transport Ministers to clarify Labour's confused position over
privatisation,.
Mr Prescott -- who is sponsored by the Rail Maritime and Transport
union -- admitted on BBC Radio 4 that if some franchises were sold their
owners would be allowed to operate them for the seven-year contractual
period.
''When they are up we will want a publicly owned and publicly
accountable railway, he said.''
Government spokesmen were not slow to point out that this meant that
the renationalisation of privatised lines would not materialise until
the General Election after next.
Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney said Labour policy was ''a
shambles'' which the party seemed to be making up as it went along.
However, a spokesman for Mr Blair said that Mr Prescott had been
setting out a policy which had been agreed when he was Transport
spokesman.
At a specialy summoned news conference at which he set out his
aspsirations for the next millennium, Mr Major repeated his confidence
that rail privatisation would be a success.
He said: ''I want to remove BR from the stand up comedian's joke book
and make it the envy of the world.''
He added that he strongly suspected that recent Labour pronouncements
on the subject represented ''the first payment of Danegeld'' to the
unions to try and buy their support for the removal of Clause 4 from the
Labour constitutionn.
He said the private sector would run the railways better and the
passengers would like the service better.
Labour believes that the privatisation programme is slowing and that
Ministers may be unable to sell off many units before the next election.
The Government intends to press ahead and the conditions on which the
first four of nearly a hundred different operating units will be sold
will be outlined by the Franchise Director later this month.
Mr Lew Adams, general secretary of the rail union Aslef, said
yesterday: ''We want to be assured that Labour intends to restore common
ownership of a public railway and not just common control of a private
railway''.
The rail union leaders remain unconvinced by Labour apparent efforts
to renew its commitment to bring the railways back into public ownership
and fear it could be part of a ploy to win acceptance of the removal of
Clause 4 from the party's constitution.
They argue that an unequivocal declaration that Labour would
renationalise rail would almost certainly kill off all fears of
privatisation going ahead as potential buyers, already thin on the
ground, almost certainly would shy away.
RMT general sectary Mr Jimmy Knapp has written to British Rail
chairman Sir Bob Reid asking for an urgent meeting of the BR council,
the industry's top consultative body, to discuss concerns including
threats to Motorail and Anglo-Scottish sleeper services.
The effects of a #400m cut in BR funding and proposals to retain
through-ticketing at a greatly reduced number of stations are other
controversial aspects of the Government's privatisation plan that the
Rail Maritime and Transport union wants to raise with Sir Bob and his
board members.
In the face of the common enemy of reduced funds and threatened
services, relations between BR and the rail unions are said to be better
than they have been for some time.
The RMT, the largest of the rail unions, has a conference policy
supporting Labour's Clause 4 and appears unlikely to rally to Labour
leader Tony Blair's call to ditch the clause which promotes ''common
ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.''
Aslef, the locomen's union, is if anything even more strongly
dedicated to Clause 4, nationalisation actually being stipulated in the
Aslef rule book.
* The Commons last night backed plans for a high-speed rail link
between London and the Channel Tunnel -- the longest new railway to be
built in Britain for a century.
The Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill, providing for the scheme, was given
a second reading without a vote.
However, the Government faced cross-party calls to tighten
environmental protection and consider building a new international
station at Stratford, east London.
Dr Mawhinney told the House that the link's benefits would ''far
outweigh'' any detrimental impact.

<TEXT>
RANGERS may be strolling away with the premier division championship,
but their personnel problems continue to accumulate. Defender Alan
McLaren, who has played in every game since he was transferred from
Hearts in October, has gone over the SFA disciplinary threshold as a
result of his yellow card against Falkirk on Saturday and will miss
three games.
The suspension will come into effect in a fortnight which will mean
McLaren having to sit out the Tennents Scottish Cup-tie with Hamilton on
January 28, the premier division game against Dundee United on February
4, and the one which follows against Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Sunday,
February 12.
The Scottish international defender, who had collected two bookings
with Hearts before he arrived at Ibrox, was also shown a yellow card
against Partick Thistle with Rangers just over a week ago.
Fortunately for manager Walter Smith, Richard Gough and Basile Boli
will be back in action before McLaren has to take his break and John
Brown is showing excellent form since he returned from a long-term
injury.
Smith said yesterday that Boli will return this weekend against Hearts
at Ibrox. ''Richard is improving by the day and, although his ribs are
still sore, he also could be ready by then. But we will know more later
in the week.''
Trevor Steven also might be in the side if he can get in another
reserve match to boost his match fitness before then, while striker Mark
Hateley is ''doing well'' in his recuperation programme. Ally McCoist,
however, is coming on more steadily, but ''getting there''. Back in the
fold is Brian Laudrup after having missed the last two games because of
international calls and Smith, reflecting on the large injury list,
reckoned that, in the circumstances, he could be pleased with a 14-point
lead at the top of the table.
And so he can, but he is well aware that the Ibrox fans are nothing,
if not hypercritical. ''People might ask why I have not bought a striker
when we had none fit recently, and the simple answer is that there were
none available. I decided I would not just buy someone to fill in.''
Smith emphasised that if the right man, who would suit him long-term,
became available he would be wearing a Rangers shirt tomorrow, but he
also pointed out that the urgency of signing a striker would recede as
the main men returned to the pool. Hateley, McCoist, and Gordon Durie,
who is suspended but also injured, will not be long in making their
comebacks and that may allow the manager to concentrate on other areas
of the team which he feels need replenishing.
In that context he has not ruled out England as a hunting ground,
although he concedes that the market there for strikers has become too
highly priced for most clubs outside the top four in the south. ''When
Arsenal pay #2[1/2]m for a reserve you can see it is getting harder all
the time as far as strikers are concerned. But I don't think the same
thing applies in the case of other positions. I don't see problems in
those areas.''

THE Royal and Ancient Golf Club may have decided that youths' golf is
past its sell-by date, but in Scotland moves are afoot to continue to
foster what officials consider to be the crucial 18-to-21 age range.
The R and A today announced a new Mid Amateur championship for older
players this season at Sunningdale which is a direct replacement for the
British Youths' championship which has been binned because they believe
players are developing earlier.
The Scottish Golf Union, however, introduced their own pioneering Mid
Amateur championship for over-25s last year as an extension, not a
straight switch, and this year are running the Scottish Youths'
championship in tandem -- at the same courses, Irvine and Irvine
Ravenspark in June, and backed by the same sponsor, Claremont.
Support for the youths was expressed at the weekend by new SGU
president George Gormley, who said: ''We are continuing at this level to
bridge the gap between boys' and adult golf and also because we think it
helps the young players mature as individuals.''
One possibility, he added, was to establish a youths home
international series. The international match against Ireland remains --
to be played at Ballybunion on June 28 -- and although the one against
England, which was to have preceded the British Youths' championship,
has gone the Scots have asked the English Golf Union for their views on
resurrection.
Should the response be positive then the Welsh might be asked to
complete the set.
The inaugural British Mid Amateur is to be played on August 16 to 20.
There will be 36 holes of stokeplay qualifying from which 64 players
will go forward to matchplay knockout. One difference from the Amateur
Championship is that the final will be over 18 holes.
Michael Bonallack, secretary of the R and A, said: ''This new
championship is intended to encourage the older amateur who has decided
against a career in amateur golf.
''Together with the decision to end the Youths' championship and the
EGA Trophy (the youth match between GB&amp;I and Europe), this move
recognises the reality that the fields for the Youths' and Amateur
championships had become broadly similar and left limited scope for the
older player.''
Curiously, the case of Stephen Gallacher tends to support the R and A
view. He won the Scottish Amateur and the Scottish Youths' titles the
wrong way round -- the former in 1992 at the age of 17 and the latter
last year. However, the SGU are not convinced that such instances
justify termination.
* ANOTHER fixture in the newly released programme is the amateur match
between Scotland and Sweden on May 1 and 2. It will be the first
international event to be staged at the new Loch Lomond course.
* THE aforementioned George Gormley, a retired general practitioner
and a member of the Moray Club, began his year's term of office with a
smile. When first addressed as President Gormley minutes after his
installation, he paused and quipped: ''For a moment there I thought I
was at a meeting of the National Union of Mineworkers.''

GORDON Strachan, Leeds United's former Scottish international midfield
player, yesterday decided to quit Premiership football, just weeks short
of his thirty-eighth birthday.
Edinburgh-born Strachan, who has been plagued by a back injury for
some time, will concentrate on coaching at Elland Road and make the
occasional reserve appearance.
Strachan, who has won Footballer of the Year awards on both sides of
the border, also had spells with Dundee, Aberdeen and Manchester United.

FOUR Scottish-based skiers have been included in Britain's six-strong
squad for the European Youth Olympic Winter Days in Andorra from
February 4 to 10.
Tessa Pirie (Aberdeen), Ross Green (Falkirk), Ross Baxter (Edinburgh),
and Michael Berkley (Forfar) are joined by Luther English, from
Yorkshire, and Sophie Ormond, who lives in France.
The sextet join skaters and speed skaters in competition that will
involve more than 1000 teenagers from 41 European countries and provide
a strong indicator of Britain's potential.
The British Olympic Association will manage the team and are also
reponsible for organising the Summer European Youth Olympics in Bath
this July.
* VETERAN Gunther Mader scored his first World Cup victory in his
Austrian homeland in the super-giant slalom at Kitzbuhel yesterday.
Mader, who has a host of overseas triumphs to his name, mastered the
bumps and twists of the lower half of the Streif course in the first
World Cup super-G held on the famous track to edge out Italy's Peter
Runggaldier by three-hundredths of a second. It was the only home win of
the Kitzbuhel programme following Saturday's downhill double by
Frenchman Luc Alphand and Sunday's slalom victory by Italy's Alberto
Tomba.
Now in his thirteenth season on the circuit, Mader previously had won
five super-Gs in a career total of 10 World Cup victories, but had never
before triumphed in his native Austria.
He clocked 1min. 21.52sec. on a track which had a vertical drop of 570
metres to win from Runggaldier (1-21.55) and fellow Austrian Armin
Assinger (1-21.70).
Mader moved up to second in the overall World Cup standings with 482
points, but is still way behind Tomba, the runaway leader with eight
victories and 850 points.

<HEADLINE>League set to outlaw 'immoral' contracts</HEADLINE>

THE type of option clause which could lead Gary Bollan, who is tied to
Dundee United for eight years should they so desire, into a court action
against the club is expected to be banned by the Scottish League.
A league appeals committee rejected an attempt by Bollan last week to
have his four-year option with the Tannadice club declared void and the
player will try one more appeal, to the SFA, before taking his search
for justice outside football and into court.
The morality of such clauses in players' contracts will be discussed
by the league's management committee when they meet on Thursday, and it
is likely the eventual outcome will mean the abolition of these
questionable extensions to transfer deals.
However, although the appeals committee denied the under-21
internationalist, who is entering the four-year option stint of a
four-year contract, some members of that committee were sympathetic.
They felt the principle of having young players sign long-term deals was
wrong, but last week's hearing was not called to rule on any moral
issue.
''A phrase in a contract, and not the morality or a principle, was all
that was to be considered,'' said Scottish League secretary Peter
Donald. ''But perhaps the wider issue will be discussed at the
management committee meeting.''
Donald added that he felt confident the Scottish League have taken
into consideration the changing situations regarding employment law.
There is a groundswell of opinion within the game that options should
be outlawed, and very few clubs actually use them. Dundee United,
however, have never been slow to have their most promising players
locked into long-term deals. Bollan is the first to force the issue into
the open and make football confront it, although another long-term
United signing, Billy McKinlay, plans to take his own case to court,
by-passing the game's appeals machinery.
It should never have been left to the likes of McKinlay and Bollan,
who has enlisted the help of Scottish Professional Footballers'
Associaton secretary Tony Higgins, to highlight the problem. Football's
authorities should have taken action long ago.
Is it wrong that a piece of paper Bollan signed as a 17-year-old
should tie him to one club for eight years of his life? Some, United's
chairman Jim McLean being among them, of course, will insist the
contract is binding and the the player and his parent ought to have been
aware of what they were doing, but others take a different view.
''To put such pressure on a young boy and his parents, or any ordinary
people who are not in the habit of dealing with contracts of employment,
is wrong,'' Higgins argues. ''Why should these people be able to
understand fully the workings of football contracts? At the time Gary's
parents presumed that the option part meant their son would have the
option of whether or not to stay when his four-year deal ended.
''It simply wasn't fair to put that pressure on them.''
It is not so very long ago, according to Higgins, that Duncan
Ferguson, who was eventually sold off to Rangers, was complaining that
he had signed a long-term contract under duress while he was around the
same age as Bollan. Fortunately, FIFA have recognised the injustice of
option clauses and no longer allow players 18 years old and under to
sign them, but that ceiling should be raised to cover 21-year-olds.
Now that it seems a sufficient number of people are inclined to
abolish option clauses, the Scottish League will probably do exactly
that, but that step will be made too late to help Bollan. However, if
the SFA are smart, they will uphold his appeal, otherwise the issue will
go to court.
There are various aspects of football's workings which would not stand
up and the game has too much to hide to allow Bollan his day in court.

IT MAY be a long shot, but Murrayfield could conceivably stage the
World Cup final if the British Isles are successful in a bid to play
hosts to the tournament in 1999.
Bill Hogg, the SRU's chief executive, said that Scotland were prepared
to take one of the qualifying pools in the finals and also house any of
the matches in the knockout stages.
''This would include quarter and semi-finals and even the final if
required,'' he pointed out.
The four home unions will be meeting shortly to consider the bids by
England and Wales to host the 1999 competition. It is understood
applications are also being made by France and other continental
countries as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.
These bids will be considered by the international board in March, by
which time it will be known whether England or Wales has been put
forward as possible hosts.
Should the tournament finals comes to the British Isles, Wales would
probably be favourites to stage the event and it is realistic to assume
that Cardiff would house the final, with England and Scotland possibly
taking some pool and knockout games.
* SOUTH Africa have sacked manager Jannie Engelbrecht -- just four
months before they are due to host the World Cup. His sacking was
announced by the executive committee of the South African RFU who said
he would be replaced by former Springbok captain Morne du Plessis.
The dismissal follows months of internal dispute within SARFU during
which Engelbrecht has clashed with union president Louis Luyt.
A statement by SARFU said: ''The decision was made to ensure an
atmosphere of harmony, co-operation and unity within South African rugby
as the tournament draws near.''
Luyt, the country's powerful rugby supremo, tried to have Engelbrecht
-- manager since June 1993 -- removed from office last year, but was
unable to dismiss the the former Springbok wing because of a public
outcry.
* KEN McCartney of Hawick has been chosen to referee England v France
at Twickenham a week on Saturday, with Jim Fleming of Boroughmuir and
Eddie Murray of Greenock Wanderers acting as his touch judges.
These three officials, together with Ray Megson of Edinburgh Wanderers
and Chuck Muir of Langholm, constitute Scotland's international panel of
referees for the current year.
* THE Scottish party for a five-match tour of Zimbabwe in May and June
will consist of the best 26 players available after Scotland's world cup
squad is known. The following dates have been finalised:
May 27 v Mashonaland or Zimbabwe A at Harare, May 21 v Matabeleland at
Bulawayo, June 3 v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo, June 7 v Country Districts
(venue to be arranged), June 10 v Zimbabwe at Harare.
* WESTERN Samoa will play four games, including one international, in
Scotland in November before going on to complete their tour with eight
games in England. The Scottish matches are:
November 8 v Edinburgh, 12 v Scotland A, 14 v North and Midlands, 18 v
Scotland at Murrayfield.
Venues for the first three games have still to be decided.

SCOTTISH women's champions MCA Cardinals Powerhouse, who suffered
their first league defeat at the weekend, yesterday won their appeal
with the Scottish Volleyball Association, who earlier had ruled that the
club should lose the points from their match with bottom-club Whitburn
on October 29 for allegedly using three ineligible players.
The three first-team players had turned out for MCA's second team, MCA
Cardinals II, in a second division match against Glenrothes Olympiad
earlier in the day before stepping up. But the rule on player
eligibility was changed at the start of the season and MCA lodged an
appeal on the grounds that they were unaware of the new rules.
The appeal was successful and the SVA overturned their earlier
decision and have now ruled that both fixtures should be replayed.
With MCA losing to Hazlehead 15-9, 11-15, 15-12, 13-15, 13-15 last
Saturday, there was a danger of the league title being decided on an
administrative technicality. As it is, the title race is still wide
open.

<HEADLINE>New Commissioner wants end to animal transport problem</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>25</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980320394</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DESPITE fears on this side of the Channel that there is little concern
in Europe over the welfare of animals in transport, the incoming
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler has expressed his determination
to bring the long-running issue to some sort of speedy conclusion.
At a ''vetting'' hearing before the European Parliament's agriculture
committee, he said that animal transport was not simply a question of
animal welfare, although that aspect did take priority for non-farmers.
''We must also look at what effect the problem is having on
consumption,'' he said. He hoped that the issue could be dealt with at
the farm council meeting next month on a basis which would mean it was
the last discussion for some time.
On the specific question of veal crates, Mr Fischler said that it
would be impossible to ban the trade in calves because of the large
market for veal in the European Union. He did acknowledge the need for
standards. ''This is not a political, but a scientific question,'' he
said.
If minimum amounts of iron and roughage were to be required in calves'
diets, consumers might have to accept veal as red meat, he said.
Alternatively, calves would have to be slaughtered before weaning to
ensure that veal maintained its traditional white colour.
Mr Fischler underlined the need to limit bureaucracy for farmers, to
improve quality for consumers, and to reduce farm fraud. The strength of
the EU, he said, was in the variety of products. Although farmers no
longer made up the majority of the rural population, they were an
integral part of the make-up of the country communities.
He pointed to a recent OECD study which showed the benefits of
maintaining farming, not all of which could be judged in purely economic
terms. Future policy would have to attract specific industries, such as
tourism, and increasingly integrate the payment of direct subsidies with
other policy areas.
Plans must be established to improve farmers' entrepreneurial skills,
and give young farmers greater opportunities. The general public would
only support rural policy if it understood its aims. He would be looking
for simplification and responsibility as key priorities.
On future expansion, the Commissioner-designate warned against falling
into the trap of opposing eastwards enlargement on the grounds that it
would only be possible if farm subsidies were reduced. ''Those who do
not want enlargement will use this idea as ammunition in their
campaign,'' he forecast. The development of new policies to deal with
enlargement would be one of his main priorities.
In response to a question on the future of the milk quota regime after
the year 2000, Mr Fischler said it was too early to predict the
direction in which the policy would move. He underlined the importance
of advance planning, to allow farmers and the trade to make the
necessary decisions.
He had observed the length of time it took the EU to decide on the
current regime, and the way ''clever'' farmers had prepared themselves
for it.
He expressed his confidence that the 1995-96 price package would be
approved fairly quickly, and that it was unlikely to contain many
surprises when it appeared next month.
French Agriculture Minister Jean Puech has indicated that the
maintenance of an efficient and competitive agricultural system in the
EU will be the main objective of the new French Presidency of the Union.
He identified reforms of the sugar, wine, and fruit and vegetable
regimes, as among the main priorities, together with the 1995-96 price
package.
The Minister said that he would be emphasising the importance of the
simplification of the CAP as part of his term of office. He proposes to
hold a series of bilateral meetings with all member States' Agriculture
Ministers to ascertain their views on the main agricultural issues.

KILMARNOCK defender Mark Skilling who, along with manager Alex Totten,
will be asked by the SFA to explain criticism of referee Bill Crombie
following the controversial game with Celtic on Saturday, will not be
disciplined by either the authority or his club for the rude gesture he
made to Parkhead striker Pierre van Hooydonk at the end of the match.
Although the Killie man's defiant hand-signal was captured by
photographers and TV cameramen, I understand that neither referee Bill
Crombie nor referee supervisor Douglas Hope saw it. If that is the case,
it will not be included in their reports, which are due to reach the SFA
today, and no action will be taken.
Totten did not see Skilling refuse to shake hands with the Dutchman as
a protest at what he claimed was the dive by Hooydonk which led to the
penalty that clinched the game for Celtic in the last minute.
''I had gone up the tunnel by then,'' he said. ''I have to point out
that we have a very strict disciplinary code here at Rugby Park, but we
also like to apply commonsense and that will be the case this time. Mark
will not be disciplined.
''As far as my own remarks after the game are concerned, I believe the
TV evidence justified our complaints.''
None the less Totten, who said that both Celtic goals were unfair --
one because of hand-ball by the scorer, Willie Falconer, and the other
because the penalty awarded was wrong -- knows he will be asked to
explain his comments by the general purposes committee, who monitor
public statements by players and officials.
Skilling, who insisted that van Hooydonk had, in effect, cheated by
taking a dive, will also be expected to come up with some kind of
defence.
* THE SFA yesterday acted in the face of a rising crime rate in
football, and they told clubs they must get their own house in order.
The warning came at the SFA's council meeting in Glagow and was aimed at
all levels of the game from seniors to youths.
SFA president Yule Craig, who is also chairman of the disciplinary
committee, appealed to members at the council meeting to carry the
warning back to their clubs.

BRITISH cycling yesterday lost its second major bike race in two years
with the withdrawal of sponsorship for the professional riders' Tour of
Britain.
After eight years of backing the five-day race, Kelloggs have pulled
out following a review of marketing strategy.
Two years ago the Tour of Britain, which was open to professionals and
amateurs, folded after the country's milk industry ended 36 years of
sponsorship.
John Bagnall, spokesman for the professional tour promoters, said:
''Time is very limited to find a sponsor for this year but we are
reasonably confident of finding one for next year, subject to
negotiations.''
Ian Emmerson, president of the British Cycling Federation, said:
''It's a sad blow and increases our problems. We now have to replace two
national tours.''

THE massed third and fourth years of Braidfield High School in
Clydebank sat for 50 minutes in an engrossed silence broken only by
laughter at the right places. For the four young actors of the First
Bite Theatre in Education Company, on a tour of schools to promote their
production Treading the Fineline, their audience's reaction was proof
positive that they had got it just right.
Kris Carrabine, James Attridge, Heather Robson and Chris Curran worked
without props, often miming to music, sometimes employing dialogue --
but always achieving a close rapport with their young audience.
Braidfield High has Standard Grade classes in drama in both third and
fourth years and in the afternoon about 50 pupils went into two workshop
groups, along with the actors and Lisa Anderson, senior teacher
responsible for drama, to explore a few of the many big issues raised by
the performance.
First Bite also gave those Braidfield staff members responsible for
personal and social development sets of teaching notes outlining the
various themes of the production. The teachers would undertake follow-up
study with third and fourth-year pupils.
Treading the Fineline has a wealth of themes immediately relevant to
teenagers. First Bite was awarded a commission from North Mersey
Community Trust to research attitudes to drugs in the Speke area of
Liverpool. In consultation with young people, parents, teachers, health
professionals and others, the company assembled its material, which it
describes as ''skills rather than issue based,'' encouraging young
people to ''evaluate situations and to develop and practise skills that
will enable them to make responsible, informed decisions.''
Treading the Fineline revolves round the death from a heart attack of
Linda Ford, leaving her daughter Georgina (15) to bring up her baby
brother Tommy, with little assistance from father Joe. Georgina's
feelings and her relationship with Joe, her school friends and her
teachers are sensitively examined. The audience is left to project
itself into various situations and work out its own response.
Different types of substance abuse are featured -- anabolic steroids,
cannabis, tobacco, alcohol and amphetamines -- as are the personal and
social dilemmas which Georgina in particular faces.
Coping with bereavement, caring for a baby while still at school,
reacting to well-meaning but possibly clumsy offers of support from the
school, peer pressure, how to react when you think welfare officers are
about to remove the baby from your care -- these are just some of the
themes explored in a stimulating production.
First Bite was set up in 1988 by graduates of Middlesex Polytechnic
and a founder member, Rebecca Kilbey, is now full-time administrator at
its new Edinburgh base.
The Home Secretary, Michael Howard, visited First Bite and described
its work as ''an excellent example of the power of partnerships.'' Its
main partnerships are with those it consults about material and the
bodies which fund it. Its main funding agencies are the Scottish Office
and the Scottish Arts Council, but local authorities which invite First
Bite to perform also contribute.
Braidfield High, for instance, made a bid for funding from Strathclyde
region's arts initiative fund for both the performance at Braidfield and
a similar one at Abronhill High in Cumbernauld the next day.
The accents are Scouse but the issues are universal, topical and
relevant to young people. A further three-week tour of Treading the
Fineline next month, involving secondary schools in Lothian, Strathclyde
and Central regions, is already heavily subscribed. It deserves to be
so.

TOP seed Pete Sampras made an electric start to his defence of the
Australian Open tennis title in Melbourne yesterday as former finalists
Mats Wilander and Pat Cash both failed to rekindle the inspiration of
past years.
There was no stopping Sampras as he powered to a 6-3, 6-2, 6-0
first-round victory in 73 minutes over Italian Gianluca Pozzi in a match
which provided few crumbs of comfort for his rivals.
For Wilander and Cash, however, the first hurdle proved too high on
day where youth generally prevailed over experience. Three times
champion Wilander went down in straight sets to Dutchman Jacco Eltingh
while local favourite Cash, weakened by a virus, proved unable to resist
the challenge of No.96-ranked Alex O'Brien after having won the first
set.
Both were comfortably overshadowed by 14-year-old Swiss Martina Hingis
who became the youngest player to win a singles match at the Australian
Open. She already is shaping up as a major crowd attraction in the first
women's Grand Slam tournament for nine years not to include Steffi Graf,
Monica Seles, or Martina Navratilova, but for the moment the leading men
remain the centre of attention.
Sampras looked a different man to the player beaten by Michael Chang
in the final of the Kooyong exhibition tournament two days earlier and
said later only a second successive title would satisfy him. ''Anything
less than winning is not good enough. . .I've been on both sides of
winning majors and losing finals and there's a huge difference,'' he
said. ''No-one remembers who comes second. I'm here to win.''
The American world No.1 again reminded his audience that only injuries
had allowed the likes of Andre Agassi and Boris Becker to narrow the gap
at the top of the rankings list.
''I think the injuries definitely hurt me more than anything. I felt
my tennis throughout the whole of last year was pretty high. . .I lost
only seven or eight matches.
''Trying to defend a title is something I've gotten used to in the
past couple of years and you just can't worry about it. . .I want to win
majors and that's the bottom line in tennis.''
Another former Australian champion, Jim Courier, winner in both 1992
and 1993, began his latest bid in impressive fashion by crushing the
Czech Republic's David Rikl 6-4, 6-0, 7-6.
Courier won his first title in almost 17 months in Adelaide earlier
this month and the ninth seed's display, particularly in the second set
when he crashed a succession of forehands past his startled opponent,
reflected his determined mood.
Stefan Edberg, world tennis' most unlikely senior citizen, was given a
glimpse of the future before squeezing into the second round.
Now the oldest regular among the world's elite since the retirement of
Ivan Lendl, the Swede admitted he was fortunate not to suffer his
earliest Australian Open exit in 12 years at the hands of local teenager
Mark Philippoussis.
The Melbourne player is ranked a modest No.274 in the world, but
Edberg rated him among the hardest hitters in the game after escaping
with a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, 7-5 victory.
Since Lendl's departure, Edberg is the only active player who can
boast 10 consecutive years in the world's top 10, having joined an
exclusive club formed by Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe.
It was an encouraging day, too, for seventh seed Michael Stich. The
German was beaten in the first round of both the Australian Open and
Wimbledon last year, but this time served 16 aces as he despatched
America's Jeff Tarango 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 with minimum fuss.
Chang took slightly longer to shake off Australian wildcard Paul
Kilderry, but the 16 seeds in both men's and women's singles were all
still intact.
Hingis' 6-0, 7-6 win over Californian Jolene Watanabe was a remarkably
assured performance for a teenager playing her first Grand Slam
tournament.
She now meets Japan's Kyoko Nagatsuka, with American fourteenth seed
Amy Frazier looming in the third round. Frazier, like all the seeded
women in action on the opening day, did not drop a set on her way to the
second round.

THE abiding charms of Scotland's diverse dialects are given a welcome
showcase in a new educational series to be broadcast by BBC Television.
A Tongue in Yer Heid, which begins today, comprises five dramatised
stories set in different parts of the country, faithfully reflecting the
speech idioms of Glasgow, Aberdeen, East Lothian, Ayrshire and Buchan.
The use of dialect is unashamed and uncompromising: groggin', boggin'
and mingin'; roch, reid and chapt. This is not BBC English, but then it
is not meant to be.
Each tale has been written by a ''local'' author, and is both narrated
and performed by actors using their native tongues, with a predominantly
young cast.
The programmes have been made for the Around Scotland series, and deal
in issues of particular relevance to the 10-13 age group: bullying,
families, sexuality, parental alcoholism and dyslexia.
Schools will therefore be able to employ them in the study of
language, and in the area of personal and social development.
But the strength of the writing and confident use of Scots allows the
series to transcend this audience and have a wider appeal.
Gordon Menzies, whose independent company made A Tongue in Yer Heid
for the BBC, said: ''There are many writers in Scotland who have the
ability to tell good stories in their 'ain' language, whether they come
from rural or urban backgrounds.
''In spite of the combined efforts of politicians, civil servants and
educationists over many generations to relegate Scots to the gutter, the
playground or the variety theatre, the language is still alive and
kicking. More important, it is regaining pride and confidence.''
He is openly envious of the Gaelic television fund, computing that pro
rata finance for Scots could amount to some #670m annually, but is
delighted that this series will provide a platform for the ''authentic''
voices of non-Gaels.
The four writers whose work is featured -- Ann Swan, Brian McCabe,
Frances Corr and Sheena Blackhall (twice) -- are all new to television,
another promising aspect of the production.
Sheena Blackhall, author of The Nicht Bus and the Broken Hert, both
set in the North-east and told in the Doric, believes the decision to
use Scots dialects is ''extremely important.''
She said: ''There is interest throughout the country in the resurgence
of Gaelic, and there has never been a more propitious time for Scots.
''Without its own language, a society ceases to have an identity as
such, and its use gives people a great sense of their nationhood.''
Senior BBC producer Ishbel MacLean, who is also the series producer,
admitted it had been several years since BBC Education had broadcast
programmes with such a strong emphasis on the Scots language.
* A Tongue in Yer Heid will be shown on BBC2 at 9.45am today, and on
the next four Tuesdays. It is also repeated tomorrow at 10.40am, and for
the next four Wednesdays.

James Traynor looks back at the career of Gordon Strachan . . . the
wee red devil of British football.
THEY thought it was all over for Gordon Strachan when the manager who
knows him better than anyone else, Alex Ferguson, sold him to Leeds
United for #300,000 five years ago. It wasn't, of course, because
Strachan and Leeds enjoyed a new lease of life, but yesterday it finally
did end for football's biggest wee man since Billy Bremner.
Strachan, only three weeks short of his thirty-eighth birthday, has
retired from the field, but he can't be allowed to retreat into the
backroom without one final glance at what was an illustrious and
colourful playing career which captured the imagination of many.
Anyone who could survive being taken under the wing of Jimmy
Johnstone, who moved towards the end of his career to Dens Park, where
Strachan was beginning his, had to be special, and the flame-haired,
fiery-tempered midfield player could tackle, pass, and score, but that
wasn't all. He had the ability to inspire those around him.
Born in Edinburgh on February 9, 1957, his career took in four senior
clubs, Dundee, Aberdeen, Manchester United, and Leeds United.
Strachan has in his cabinet 50 caps, which qualifies him for a place
in Scottish football's Hall of Fame, two Scottish league championship
badges, three Scottish Cup medals, an FA Cup medal, an English league
championship, and, of course, a European Cup-winners' Cup medal, but
shiny baubles are not the true measure of this footballer.
The essence of Strachan is to be found in the way in which others
perceive him, and that is as someone who wanted to win, not simply for
the glory but because second place was an affront to his pride.
His name will be mentioned among the greats of his own and other
generations. His mock attempt to leap an advertising hoarding, which was
the fashion among goalscorers in the Mexico World Cup finals in 1986,
after he had scored against West Germany, lives in the collective
memory.
Others may remember also that Strachan, just as those belligerent
little big men, Bremner and Dave Mackay, before him could antagonise
fans of opposing sides and twice he was the target of attacks in matches
against Celtic. The more famous of the two attempted assaults occurred
at Celtic Park in 1980, but Strachan survived to annoy many more hordes.
In a perverted sense, the abuse he suffered could have been
interpreted as a sign of the remarkable influence which he was able to
exert on a match, and it was because that very quality is on the wane
that he has decided to concentrate on coaching at Elland Road. Strachan
preferred to go out at the top and drew tributes yesterday from players
and managers alike.
Ferguson, who could not have moulded Aberdeen into a side capable of
winning in Europe without Strachan, Howard Wilkinson, and Ron Atkinson
all spoke in glowing terms, but one of his former Pittodrie team-mates,
Alex McLeish, offered his own, and peculiar, accolade which deserves to
be recorded.
''He has shown he was special, but he had this intelligence which
allowed him to assess situations very quickly,'' McLeish said.
''He had everything in ability and intelligence to match -- all he
lacked was the height of a Cruyff. Can you imagine what Gordon could
have been had he been as tall as Cruyff? It's frightening.''
Still, for a small fellow, he managed to make a big impression and
McLeish remembered also his sharp sense of humour which often left the
credibility of friend and foe alike bleeding profusely.
''A number of years ago, when Aberdeen were playing away in Europe,
Gordon had to room with Willie Garner, who walked in his sleep,''
McLeish said. ''Gordon woke in the middle of the night to find Willie
patting his Adidas bag.
''Gordon, scared stiff because he had never seen anything like it
before, went over to Willie and asked if he was all right. Still asleep,
Willie snarled some kind of response which scared Gordon even more but,
quick as a flash, the wee man said: 'It's okay, big man, I'm just asking
if you want me to take your bag for a walk.' ''
McLeish swears the story is more than apocryphal. But there never was
anything dubious about Strachan's talent -- he has the credentials to
prove he was there and did it all.

THE British Wool Marketing Board looks set to diversify its activities
further, by buying one of Scotland's oldest co-operatives, Scottish Wool
Growers Ltd.
A spokesperson for the BWMB in Bradford confirmed yesterday that
through their subsidiary, Wool Growers (Great Britain) Ltd, negotiations
were at an advanced stage.
Scottish Wool Growers operate from two depots in Scotland -- Evanton
in Ross-shire, and Hillington, Glasgow, as well as from Carnforth in
Cumbria.
The co-op was established in 1926 as an organisation to serve the best
interests of sheep farmers, and currently has a membership in the region
of 1300 farmers and crofters. The co-op, besides selling a wide range of
farm requisites has, as its principal source of income, commission
charges for acting as agents and graders for the BWMB at its two
Scottish depots.
Chairman of the co-op, Lanarkshire farmer Jim Brown of Birthwood, near
Biggar, commented: ''We are under no pressure to sell the business, but
we have had an approach, and it is our duty to act in the best possible
interests of our members. This is certainly not a hostile bid, and at
present I would say that the chances of the deal going ahead are
50-50.''
Further meetings are planned to take place this week. Wool Growers are
predicting a profit of around #280,000 for the current year, from which
farmers will be paid a dividend based on a formula which allows the
organisation to pay a maximum of no more than 2% above the highest bank
base rate for the year in question.
Turnover from sales of requisites is in the order of #3m annually.
Any possible sale would have to be put to the membership for approval,
but should a deal be agreed, shareholders can expect a healthy cash
windfall.
Meanwhile, it has also been revealed that the appeal in the Court of
Session in Edinburgh by independent wool merchants Reid and Robertson,
against the interdict granted in favour of the BWMB preventing the
Alexandria firm from buying direct from producers, is to be heard in
March.
Reid and Robertson maintained at earlier hearings that they were
entitled to act as buyers on the grounds that they were purchasing for
markets outwith the UK in the same manner as the Irish company
Texacloth, who moved into Scotland in 1993 -- and who last year shipped
out 1000 tonnes of Scottish wool on the basis of a fixed
cash-on-the-nail price.
* THE illicit trade in small ware potatoes -- sold for planting, but
without the benefit of certification -- has damaged the international
reputation of a ''once proud industry,'' the Scottish Seed Potato
Development Council said yesterday.
A recent study by independent consultants has identified the small
ware issue as one of the most important concerns to growers this winter.
Prosecutions are pending in both Edinburgh and Aberdeen against parties
accused of selling uncertified potatoes as seed.
''An industry divided, is an industry weakened -- and that is what we
have become,'' says the development council in its most recent
newsletter.
A special study commissioned by the council has been investigating
complaints of non-availability of new Scottish varieties, which is said
to be a factor contributing to the production of small-ware.
It concluded that to be a major success (more than 3000 tonnes of seed
sold in a year) a new controlled variety would require powerful
promotion and commercial backing. It would be necessary to produce large
tonnages, perhaps ahead of actual demand, incurring a considerable
financial risk.
The study concluded that the risks involved in breeding and market
development were likely to restrict the production of new varieties,
except by organisations -- including governments -- that were able to
take the longest possible view of strategic advantages.

There are some surprising responses to a survey of what
children do at primary playtime. GRAEME SMITH reports.
A SCOTTISH educational psychologist is calling for the greater use of
playtime in primary schools, said to be one of the five distinct worlds
of childhood.
Mr Ewen Rennie, who is based in Grampian Region, believes that, by
providing children with the proper facilities, there can be numerous
benefits -- from helping to reduce accidents to tackling bullying.
He is encouraging schools with which he works to provide play
materials such as skipping ropes, slides and climbing frames, and to
mark out areas for games such as hopscotch.
"If games are drawn out the children also need to be taught how to
play them. Many parents are afraid to let their children out nowadays
and as a result they don't know how to play street games," said Mr
Rennie, whose research will soon be published.
He explained: "I went round schools to look at what kids did in
playgrounds with facilities and compared them with others where mob rule
seemed to operate. There were significant differences.
''A lot of our work comes from the fact that kids get into
difficulties in the playground because it is an almost unsupervised
situation, there are different age groups mixing, and the rules are not
very clear to the kids. They are put out to enjoy themselves and get
some fresh air while the teachers get a break.
"I was rather suprised by the response to the first question in the
survey I did in which one-third of the children indicated they would
prefer to stay in during their break, although it was summer.
''I also asked questions related what kids do at playtime and the
predominant activity among the boys was playing football. Other research
has shown that if you look at a playground the older boys monopolise the
space with their football.
''If the school provided ropes or other things to play with the girls
made mention of this but if there was nothing provided the girls seemed
at a loss to suggest what they did.
"I then asked them what kind of things could be done to improve
playtime. There were pretty sensible sugestions such as give us some
goalposts, provide a quiet area where we can sit and chat to our mates
and an area where we can play a game without being disturbed by a ball
whizzing through."
Mr Rennie said he believed schools were beginning to recognise the
problems but few had offered any solutions.
"Painting games like hopscotch on the playground is fine but often the
children don't know what the games are about and have to be taught them
and they are often painted in places where the mass football match is
going on.''
Mr Rennie said a group of psychologists in Fife recently looked at
playground behaviour in the context of the curriculum and concluded that
it had potential for pupils' social and personal development.
The Fife psychologists suggested that playground initiatives could be
treated differently from school to school. In some it might be
appropriate to tackle issues such as bullying, while in others a focus
on environmental improvements might be more effective.
Mr Rennie pointed to the success of a project by Tommy MacKay and Sue
Briggs of Strathclyde Region's psychological service at a school where
the headteacher described the playground as "a battlefield."
A survey disclosed that 93% of the primary three and four pupils felt
they had been the victims of bullying. The playground was the most
frequent problem area. Twelve pupils were selected by the school to
include their most difficult and challenging cases and in two groups of
six they undertook a one-hour weekly groupwork session for one term.
A strong sense of group identity emerged and a key feature was the
inclusion of games. Enjoyment was the backdrop to developing social
skills and personal qualities such as honesty and trust. The project
resulted in a dramatic change not only in the school ethos.
Mr Rennie said: "In the classroom there are certain rules and they are
enforced by an adult but in the playground you have to negotiate your
own standing. You have to make your own way into it.
"School is about more than examination league tables and academic
progress. Playtimes are an important part in developing pupils' social
skills."
Aberdeen's Causewayend Primary School has adopted Mr Rennie's
suggestions with considerable success. Headteacher Alistair Mackay said:
"When the children come back into class after doing something worthwhile
and getting rid of some excess energy they are quite happy and ready to
start work."
The school has acquired a number of play materials such as hoops and
skipping ropes and, thanks to the efforts of the PTA, has been able to
buy adventure playground equipment which is sited in a garden area in
the school grounds. It also has a room which the children can visit
during the morning break and at lunchtime to play boardgames or make
jigsaws.
The older children put out the equipment and supervise and that has
given them a sense of responsibility, which has been reflected in their
behaviour. Senior teacher Catherine Taylor, the driving force behind the
project at the school, said it had been very worthwhile.
"Some people suggested that everything we provided would be wrecked
but it has been quite the reverse. The children look after the
equipment. There has been trial and error. Bats became hitting
instruments and balls kept going over the wall but it has been a great
success and, apart from the climbing frame, the total cost has probably
been less than #200.
"School playgrounds can be like prison exercise yards where a lot of
people are put out in a concrete area with nothing to do. That might be
OK for prisoners but it's not for children."

NO FEWER than three top basketball tournaments are lined up for
Glasgow this year. Following the phenomenal success of last year's
Adidas 3-on-3 Tournament at Glasgow Green, when 35 courts were in action
on one Sunday in July, the organisers are pledged to return, and hope to
increase this to 50.
Possibly as a result of these impressive participation figures --
there were well over 300 teams -- the rival Converse NBA 3-on-3 Tour are
looking at coming to Glasgow as well, probably in early September,
although outdoor play in Scotland then could be hazardous.
The UK organiser is well known in Scotland -- Alton Byrd, the former
MIM point guard and Forum Sports Centre manager in Livingston, who,
among other things, is now a Radio Five commentator on American sports.
Last year Byrd had two UK venues, at the London Docklands, where there
were more than 500 teams, and Sheffield, which was much less successful.
He has been looking at either Edinburgh or Glasgow to replace the steel
town in this year's programme, which features exotic venues all over
Europe, including the Eiffel Tower.
Despite the scenic attractions of the capital, Byrd has opted for
Glasgow: ''I intend to look at a number of potential sites for a large
number of outdoor courts, including Glasgow Green and the SEC.''
Although he did not mention Ibrox as a possible venue, the man who was
once dubbed the best player under 6ft in America might perhaps have in
mind an approach for support from his former MIM employer, David Murray.
The third tournament is already tied up and it has now been confirmed
that the City of Glasgow is to give financial support to the European
Junior Men's Championship, which will go ahead in the Kelvin Hall from
April 12 to 16.
It is not yet clear what selective funding is available to grant-aid
the preparation of the Scotland team, who will have a formidable task
whatever financial support they receive. The opposing teams are Russia,
Sweden, Iceland, Belgium, and Austria.
Unfortunately, Scotland coach John Grant can choose from only one year
of the two years currently playing junior basketball in Scotland --
those born in 1978, as they must still be eligible for the finals the
following year.
Scotland have now definitely withdrawn from the European Junior
Women's Championship and will seek more suitable competition nearer
home, even though this is costing the SBA a fine.
The Scots were drawn away in Tampere, Finland, against Croatia, Czech
Republic, Finland, and Lithuania in the junior women's event, with no
prospect of winning a match or even getting close. Wisely, coach Stewart
Harris has decided to pull out and seek more appropriate competition
nearer home. The SBA have backed his line despite the automatic fine.
At club level, Harris, who coaches Polonia women, has now only one
other team to worry about. Royal High defeated the champions,
Livingston, 67-63 at the Forum last Sunday, thus ending all hope of
their retaining the title, which will now be a straight fight between
Royal High and Polonia.

INCISIVE new-ball bowling by Glen Chapple and Dominic Cork put England
A in command of the first Test on an action-packed third day in
Bangalore. At the close India A were 83 for seven in their second
innings, a lead of only 94. Spinners Paul Weekes and Richard Stemp also
each took a wicket in the last 15 minutes to leave the A team confident
of forcing victory.
Earlier yesterday a brilliant innings of 99 from Mark Ramprakash,
together with some stout tail-end resistance from Chapple, had clawed
England A up to 289 following a startling middle-order collapse.
The day began well with Ramprakash and Alan Wells going immediately on
to the attack, but Indian leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule then took three
wickets in 10 balls as 191 for three suddenly became 213 for seven.
But Ramprakash held firm, put on hold the sparkling strokeplay of the
first half-hour and, with Chapple's help, rebuilt the innings.
It was a knock that deserved 100, but Indian Test off-spinner Rajes
Chaunan went round the wicket for the last ball of an over and the
change in angle was enough to induce a nick to the keeper. Ramprakash
had faced 202 balls, hitting two 6's and nine 4's.
Chapple thumped a couple of boundaries before being last man out for
26, but the 20-year-old Lancashire paceman still had his most important
contribution to come.
Charging in on a thankfully cooller day than is usual in southern
India, Chapple took three for 21 in 11 overs either side of tea. Cork,
at the other end, was only marginally less impressive, and he also kept
going through a slight thigh strain to pick up two for 31 from his 11
overs.
* ENGLAND'S Under-19s had to settle for a draw in their first Test
against West Indies Youth in Port of Spain despite a gallant bowling and
fielding performance. On the final day, captain Marcus Trescothick of
Somerset completed his century before declaring and setting the West
Indies 349 to win.
Off-spinner Vikram Solanki of Worcestershire took four wickets but
could not remove De Groot as the Guyanan -- usually an opener but
batting down the order due to a broken finger -- held out for the last
16 overs.
India A 300 and 83 for seven (G Chapple 3-21); England A 289 (M R
Ramprakash 99, J E R Gallian 58, N V Knight 50).
England Under-19s 317 and 199 for four, decl (M Trescothick 106 n.o.);
West Indies Youth 168 and 152 for seven (V Solanki 4-50).

THE Chris Eubank-Ray Close fight for the WBO super-middleweight
championship, scheduled for Belfast on February 11, has been called off.
Close, who twice failed to wrest the title from Eubank (he drew with
the champion in Glasgow, then lost on a majority points decision in
Belfast), failed a brain scan and was withdrawn. His career as a fighter
could be over.
The show will go on, however, with Eubank defending against Dublin's
Steve Collins, the WBO middleweight champion who steps up a weight.
Close was last night ''shocked and dumbfounded'' and said ''I think I
owe it to myself to look for a second opinion.''
* THE fighting Quinns from Tranent had a packed Brunton Hall in
Musselburgh rocking last night as the two brothers kept Scotland's
boxing credibility on the rise.
Willie ''The Mighty'' laid the ghost of his only pro defeat when he
beat Newcastle's Mark Jay after 2min 51sec of the second round, and
brother Tommy made his entry into the pro ranks by knocking out
Birmingham's Billy McDougall in the fifth.
Keith Knox, the former ABA champion from Bonnyrigg extended his
unbeaten pro run to five when he outpointed Middlesbrough's Neil Parry.
Other results:
Super feather -- Hugh Collins (Stirling) outpointed John T Kelly
(Hartlepool), sixth round. Light -- Tanveer Ahmed (Glasgow) beat Mickey
Hall (Ludworth), rsc fourth round. Light-middle -- Billy Collins
(Stirling) outpointed Seamus Casey (Alfreton), sixth round.
* DENNIS Andries, admitted yesterday to the true march of time. The
man who has always refused to disclose his real age, insisted he will
challenge Leeds' Denzil Browne for the vacant British cruiserweight
title on Saturday -- at the age of 48.
Andries who, at Glasgow's SECC, makes his sixtieth ring appearance,
has always been credited with a birth date of November 5, 1953.

ROGER Black yesterday delivered a vote of confidence in British
athletics following the sport's drug-ridden 1994. Black, twice the
European 400 metres champion, admitted: ''There is more suspicion from
the public than ever before and really you can't blame them.'' But he
insisted: ''I still believe the vast majority of British athletes do not
take drugs. Figures produced which show that more than 99% of tests were
negative proves that.''

FALKIRK were still not certain last night if their defender, John
Hughes, will be suspended from the game with Partick Thistle at
Brockville tonight.
Manager Jim Jefferies did not know if Hughes had been given the
equivalent of a yellow or red card when he was taken aside by the
referee following his outburst to a linesman after the home defeat by
Rangers.
Hughes was convinced Charlie Miller had been offside when he set up
Rangers' winning goal and apparently told the official his view in
explicit fashion.
Jefferies had hoped the offence would not entail a suspension but it
is almost certain that he will have to do without the team's most
inspirational player.
With Joe McLaughlin struggling to be fit -- he missed Saturday's game
-- the manager may put John Clark into the heart of defence but,
whatever his line-up, he believes a win could be crucial in their bid to
stay in the premier division.
Thistle will be without Rod McDonald, ordered off against Aberdeen on
Saturday, but also have a worry about a virus which has affected five of
their players.
Mark Skilling, the Kilmarnock defender at the heart of Saturday's
penalty controversy in the game at Hampden against Celtic, has a slight
hamstring injury but is expected to be fit to play against Motherwell at
Rugby Park. Killie have Neil Whitworth available again after suspension.
Motherwell will have the same squad as pleased manager Alex McLeish in
Friday's no-scoring draw with Hibs.
* SCOTTISH football is to consider a revolutionary move for major
clubs to farm out emerging young stars to others in the lower divisions.
That could mean clubs such as Rangers, Celtic, and Aberdeen allowing
players to turn out for clubs such as Alloa, Cowdenbeath, and Albion
Rovers.
The Scottish league management committee will take the first steps on
Thursday towards an in-depth look at the plan.
* CALEDONIAN Thistle have suspended midfielder Colin Mitchell for a
breach of club discipline following an incident over the festive period.
Mitchell was not in the first-team squad for the 1-1 draw at home to
Arbroath on Saturday, nor did he play for the reserve side which drew
with Elgin City in the North Cup.
* MANCHESTER United were yesterday relieved to hear that striker Mark
Hughes had not damaged knee ligaments.
It was feared that the Welsh internationalist -- subject of a #2m
inquiry by Everton -- had sustained a possible career-threatening injury
in Sunday's Premiership draw against Newcastle.
But the Old Trafford side received the news that, although Hughes had
sustained a nasty gash down to the bone -- which required 15 stitches --
and tendon damage, there was no ligament trouble.
* THE next five days could make or break Stirling Albion's promotion
bid from the second division. They visit Clyde tonight and Dumbarton on
Saturday and manager Kevin Drinkell said that ''two good results would
really open up this league.''
Montrose last night moved to strengthen their squad in their bid for
promotion from the third division. The Angus club's manager, John Holt,
was locked in signing talks with Alloa's Neil McAvoy after the clubs had
agreed a deal earlier in the day. McAvoy could be included against East
Stirlingshire tonight.
* LIVERPOOL'S Roy Evans has been rewarded for a successful start to
his managerial career with an extension to his existing contract. The
Anfield board have offered Evans a new deal which extends his present
ties to the club by two years.
Evans is almost certain to put pen to paper on the new agreement --
his old one being due to run out in 18 months.
MARK McGhee's Leicester City yesterday completed the #1m signing of
Norwich striker Mark Robins.

BARCLAY McBAIN investigates ways to improve the female ratio what is
perceived as a traditional male career
THE glass ceiling doesn't exist in the tangible world of metal,
bricks, and mortar. But, for those committed to equal opportunities, it
remains a potent emblem of the many barriers which stand in the way of
women and promotion.
Even if it did exist -- perhaps as a monument to the inequality of
opportunity on the career ladder -- you could bet your bottom dollar
that women would have little to do with its construction.
You need engineers to invent, design, and make things which are
usually for the public good. We don't have enough engineers and very few
of those we do have are women. Why should this be so? Dr Judy Wilkinson,
who teaches electronics and electrical engineering at Glasgow
University, is about to suggest some answers, and put forward some
proposals for improving the female ratio.
Tomorrow she will deliver the latest in the Women on Wednesday
lectures which mark the centenary of women in the university -- a
milestone which is, indeed, cause for celebration. But the university
has produced statistics which show that, while women in the arts, law,
medicine, and science at Glasgow have achieved near-parity with men, the
proportion entering engineering varies from 2% to 15%. Glasgow is not
unique with these figures.
Dr Wilkinson, a physics graduate who did her PhD at Standford
University, California, suspects that women do not study engineering
because of the teaching of physics in school, the image of women
engineers, and the general perception of engineering.
Higher physics is second only to maths as an entry requirement for
most engineering courses. Yet only about one-third of pupils studying
physics in Scotland are girls. Although girls are 20% more likely than
boys to gain five or more Standard grades at the top credit level and
achieve more Highers than boys, few have Highers in physics and
chemistry.
''The evidence is that girls choose not to enter engineering because
of the association with physics rather than because they are
biologically incapable,'' says Dr Wilkinson.
Research has shown that gender is an important issue in accounting for
girls' low participation rate in physics. The Girls in Science and
Technology project in Manchester found that gender differences in
classroom behaviour often undermined girls' confidence.
''Boys tended to dominate the classroom and monopolise equipment. They
demand more of the teachers' time and, as they progress through the
system, female pupils may be reduced to a service role in science and
technology, taking notes and cleaning up while boys carry out practical
work,'' the project indicated.
Dr Wilkinson also suspects that the theories and practices of physics
work against girls by mirroring a male perspective. Boys are encouraged
to tinker while girls, who have learned to play more passive roles, are
encouraged to be careful.
About 10 years ago Dr Wilkinson worked with the then Jordanhill
College in a technology project involving engineering apprentices and 20
primary schools. For the first few weeks the girls stood by and watched
as the boys plunged in and played with the equipment.
But after six weeks the girls were just as confident as the boys and
played a full part. Dr Wilkinson argues that the gender difference does
not occur in primary schools which expose pupils at the earliest age to
science and technology projects.
They work in teams, for instance, to produce a toy theatre with
lights. Engineering is, says Dr Wilkinson, first and foremost about
designing and constructing works of public utility, and exploring its
practical applications should be extended into secondary school, for
example with the building of a mini-turbine for a Third World village
and then into higher education with the manufacture of, for example, a
foetal heart monitor.
''Many schools and universities are developing projects such as these
but information and good practice should be more widely disseminated,''
she says. Dr Wilkinson argues that establishing relationships is part
and parcel of learning for many girls. Culturally, women tend to be more
humane than men, are more inclined to work well with others, and are
interested in how science affects the way we live, she says. Very few
girls, she points out, bother with computer games.
A group of universities is involved in the Science Fair, an initiative
for 14 and 15-year-olds which goes round Scottish schools. The topics in
which girls are most interested are foetal heart monitors and video
cameras. And a survey of female postgraduate students has shown that
they tend to choose projects with a practical relevance.
''If we are concerned about the major problems facing the world --
poverty, pollution, and population -- then engineers should be
encouraged to have a more female approach to engineering,'' says Dr
Wilkinson. But that approach should not discourage boys, she believes.
''If we produce a curriculum in the schools and universities which
appeals to males and females we may educate people who can address, as
engineers, the pressing problems confronting us.''
But it remains a major challenge. The cultural divide is very deep. Dr
Wilkinson believes it is still the case that women who go into physics
and engineering tend to have had parents who were in either profession,
or to have gone to an all-girls school.
''I went to an all-girls school where there was no peer pressure. If
you were good at physics you were encouraged,'' she recalls.
Dr Wilkinson has three children. Her eldest daughter started on an
arts course at Edinburgh University but is now true to her mother's
theory. She switched to engineering and is doing a PhD on reinstating
micro hydro-electricity plants in Sri Lanka. They fell into disrepair
after the establishment of a national grid which turned out to be
unreliable when it came to meeting the country's tea-drying needs.
If her PhD were not sufficiently utilitarian she is also boning up on
the practical application of her chosen profession by taking an evening
course in welding. And Dr Wilkinson proudly reports -- with some humour
-- that the gender distinction has been further blurred by one of her
daughter's male friends. He has taken up knitting.

A SCOTTISH company hopes to be at the cutting edge in South Africa, as
the country's post-Apartheid economy is carved out.
Ryden, which in 1991 became the first UK chartered surveyor to
establish a permanent office in Prague, is actively pursuing the
opportunities created by political sea changes in Eastern Europe and
more recently in South Africa.
Jim Fiddes, senior partner at Ryden's Edinburgh office, said: ''Great
political changes are taking place and, as a result of these changes, we
see great opportunities emerging.''
Six or seven years ago, Ryden, which has also had a presence in Poland
and St Petersburg for the last two years, made a conscious decision to
pro-actively pursue a global strategy, rather than become the Scottish
end of an international firm.
However, although the property consultant may set up further offices
in Southern and Eastern Africa and in Eastern Europe, Mr Fiddes
emphasised that these efforts are aimed at ''adding value to our native
business here in Scotland''.
While other British firms have established associations in South
Africa, Ryden is the first UK chartered surveyor to establish a new
company, Ryden Sykes, LeSage &amp; Murray, based in Johannesburg.
The principal players in the international real estate venture are Mr
Fiddes, who is also chairman of the London arm Ryden Sykes, Richard
Sykes in London, South African property expert John Murray, who will
head the operation, and Linda LeSage, who runs LeSage Ryden Sykes'
office in Manhattan.
Although British investment has been slow to re-emerge in the new
South Africa, the UK Government has launched several supportive
initiatives and the new company, which will also be involved in local
property deals, hopes to play a key role in bringing both UK and US
companies back to a country they pulled out of because of Apartheid.
Mr Fiddes explained: ''We have been down there three times in the last
18 months and I am extremely impressed with the efforts being made on
all sides to make the political change work and to ensure that South
Africa emerges, as it should, as a very progressive country. It is only
a matter of time before people will start to invest in South Africa.''

<HEADLINE>Tomkins runs up #115m profit</HEADLINE>

LIKE a well oiled machine, Tomkins continues to increase profitability
seemingly without any great difficulty, but the snag is that the share
price performance is much more choppy, with the stock having fallen over
the last two years by 4% compared with the FTSE showing a 15% advance.
That does seem a little unfair to the group in that executive chairman
Greg Hutchings has again delivered the goods, with interim pre-tax
profits ahead 22% to #115m. Underlying organic growth accounted for
about 19% of the advance.
Mr Hutchings ruled out a major acquisition for the next few months --
something over #500m and which for strategic reasons would mean moving
outside the existing range of activities. However, it does seem probable
that there could be bolt-on deals of up to #100m, which would soak up
some of the current #204m cash resources. The inflow of funds in the
half year to end October was a heartening #141m, including an
undisclosed amount from RHM but probably around #40m.
He indicated that he would prefer an even greater concentration of
non-cyclical activities to raise them from the current 40% of turnover
which, in the interim period, increased 17% to #1791m.
The impetus came from the US, where there is currently the happy
combination of continuing recovery by early and mid-cycle industries
such as automotive and housing, while the heavy end is only now
beginning to gear up.
That territory brought in 53% of operating profits, thanks to strong
performances in bathroom and window equipment and components for
recreational vehicles.
The Smith &amp; Wesson subsidiary cannot produce handguns fast enough,
including the Ladysmith, as fears and concerns about crime escalate. It
is being helped by the new Sigma pistol which is part polymer and one
third lighter than the all-metal gun.
UK profits advanced 29% to #43.6m and were helped by an additional #4m
from RHM, where the milling and baking margins are still described as
unsatisfactory at just 3.3%. Another 600 jobs have gone there and the
bloodletting will continue, although the emphasis now appears to be more
at the managerial levels. Since the acquisition, some 4000 people have
left RHM for a residual workforce of 21,000.
One conceptual problem is perhaps that the City thinks RHM is highly
dependent upon bread profits, whereas the margins lie with value-added
products such as cakes and other ''stickies'', food mixes and branded
products including the important Sharwoods.
Even if there is no opportunity to raise UK bread prices, RHM this
year will raise its contribution to about #118m compared with the #80m
it was making when Mr Hutchings deftly removed it from the clutching
Hanson hands.
Rebutting criticisms of his remuneration, #1,388,000 last year, and
saying that no shareholder had ever said anything adverse -- unlike the
press -- he pointed to the 28% compound growth rate in earnings per
share, which is almost four times that of the UK average and a diviend
performance not lagging that far behind.
And there seems little reason to expect any diminution in
outperformance, with full-year profits likely increase from #257m to
about #315m, which would leave the shares at 230p trading at just over
12 times likely earnings. That is too cheap against the market,
particularly when backed by a yield of 4.6% on the basis of the forecast
increase of at least 15.2% in the full-year dividend to 8.5p.
The interim dividend has been raised 16.8% to 2.43p.

THERE remains tremendous growth potential in the UK for private
nursing homes because of the reduction in state provision and an ageing
population. For many smaller nursing home groups there are problems
raising funds to finance expansion plans.
However, this is about to change following the publication yesterday
of the Pathfinder Prospectus for Nursing Home Properties. NHP is a new
concept in the UK in property investment to finance nursing home
developments on a sale and leaseback basis.
NHP hopes to raise as much as #30m towards the cost of nursing home
acquisitions through a placing and public offer of ordinary shares.
Funds raised through the share issue will be substantially enhanced by
loan finance from the National Westminster Bank but will be limited so
that the maximum level of gearing is no greater than NHP's share capital
and reserves.
The lease periods on the modern purpose-built homes will be at least
25 years. Agreements to acquire #43.5m of nursing homes have already
been entered into with four leading operators including Grampian Care
and Ashbourne Homes.
NHP's chief executive Richard Ellert said the investment emphasis
would be on homes less than five-years-old with more than 40 beds
catering largely for private fee-paying old people requiring a high
level of care. Mr Ellert is currently in discussions with many operators
and in future expects about a third of nursing home bed expansion to be
financed through lease finance.
The benefit to companies will be that they will be able to enhance
earnings per share without having to raise capital which should in
theory boost the share price.
One company that is hoping for such a result is Tamaris, the small
nursing home operator and one of the original subscribers to NHP
property. Having got the company on a sound financial footing, chairman
William Fitch is keen to expand the number of beds to 1000 during the
course of this year. Tamaris intends to lease from NHP, 194 beds in
eight homes in Northern Ireland.
Growth in Tamaris is to come through the acquisition of profitable
independent nursing homes of which there are many in the UK.
However, it is early days yet. In the six months to September 30
Tamaris made a pre-tax profit of #118,000 compared with #2000
previously. Turnover inched ahead to #1.9m and earnings per share
improved to 0.05p from 0.01p.

ONLY the lucky few manage to combine work and play, bounding out of
bed at the first bleep of the alarm clock in anticipation of a day spent
doing something they love -- and being paid for it too. The boom in
leisure activities over the past 15 years has seen the growth of sports
and leisure complexes, alongside private health and fitness centres.
It is an expanding industry which has opened doors of opportunity for
sports and fitness enthusiasts to develop a spare-time activity into a
challenging career.
Yet to succeed in the fiercely competitive 1990s market of
customer-orientated leisure services you need to be more than a fitness
freak with a well-honed body. Changing trends in public tastes and
imminent local government reorganisation mean the industry, both private
and public sectors, is preparing for a ''new dawn,'' according to the
president of the Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management (ILAM),
Anthea McWatt.
The public sector leisure industry has become a huge, wide-ranging
service of choice, in direct competition with the plethora of facilities
on offer in private health clubs. Well-trained, qualified professionals,
conversant with all aspects of sports and leisure management, are
essential to take the industry forward and develop its role in a
changing environment, says the institute in this month's edition of its
journal, The Leisure Magazine.
LivingWell health club, opening next month in Glasgow city centre, is
a prime example of the competition, and of how far the leisure industry
has come since the 1960s, when it constituted little more than the local
park and swimming baths.
Large and luxurious, LivingWell offers modern health and exercise
equipment and facilities. Pre-activity consultations are available to
assess a client's medical history, blood pressure, body composition and
eating habits, enabling fitness instructors to compile individually
tailored health programmes.
The club's general manager, Peter Wright, is a former fitness
instructor who has a degree in recreational management, in addition to
comprehensive experience in running a health club. He is a model example
of the blend of experience and qualifications which can lead to the top
rung of leisure management.
''A degree, perhaps done through day-release, to add a professional
qualification to basic qualifications and on-the-job experience is very
important in this competitive age,'' says Alastair Edwards, a recreation
manager at the Allander Sports Centre in Bearsden, ''especially if you
want to work your way up to management. Today's managers, whether in the
public or private sector, need strong marketing and commercial skills.
Courses in leisure management, such as those offered by Glasgow
Caledonian University or Heriot Watt, are ideal.''
To insert a foot in the door of the public sector, it is essential to
have the Royal Lifesavers' Bronze Medallion. Courses, run by sports
centres, are in high demand. First aid and coaching qualifications also
help. Scotvec courses, covering topics from table tennis to windsurfing,
are offered by many higher education colleges.
First and foremost, however, working in a service industry requires
fine people skills. Alan Smith, director of ILAM, agreed on the need for
qualifications for those wanting to make a career in leisure. He
emphasised the need to ''stay qualified,'' advocating professional
development through reading, courses and seminars.
This month ILAM launches a new project-based professional development
course, aimed at keeping leisure managers abreast of the latest policy
and proble solving.
A career in leisure is not an easy option, however. Alan Smith says:
''You are working when others are playing, and can be on early morning
or late-night shifts. Serving the public is hard work, and as you move
upwards you are involved in policy-making and decisions about running a
large public facility. It's challenging work but the opportunities are
certainly there.''
Although Mr Smith indicated that salaries can be variable on the
manual side of the industry, because of part-time or casual contracts
and shift-work, he claimed they became increasingly competitive once
management level was reached.
Being prepared to move around is the best way to gain experience,
advised Andy Tannoch, a manager at the Irvine Magnum Centre. ''Even in a
large complex such as ours, which employs around 100 staff, you would
need to gain experience in different posts, in different places, if you
want to reach management level,'' he said.
Moving between private and public sector is one way of increasing
experience and work opportunities. Joanne Gallacher, 32, opened
Footworks Fitness Centre in Milngavie last May with with her husband and
business partner Peter. Originally trained in ballet, Joanne taught for
some years: danceworks in Oxford Street, London, then aerobics at the
Kelvin Hall international sports arena and the Allander Sports Centre,
during the Jane Fonda-led aerobics boom of the 80s.
Joanne believes training and qualifications, such as those set up by
the Exercise Teachers' Association, are just as vital in the private
sector. Today's clients, faced with a wealth of choice, increasingly
look for a high standard of fitness training.
''The general public are more aware now of the need to have a good,
qualified teacher. When I started anyone could set up as an aerobics
instructor -- and in reality still can,'' said Joanne. ''But people
often phone Footworks and ask about our qualifications, of which we have
a wall-full now, before they come to us.''
Joanne anticipates the fitness industry developing along the American
model in the next few years. As in the case of Footworks, classes will
become smaller and more intimate, led by well-trained teachers, with
clients opting more for individual sessions with a personal trainer.
The use of sport and fitness regimes to fight juvenile crime and
ill-health could further expand opportunities. Sports professionals,
backed by ILAM, and the police are increasingly persuaded of the value
of sport and fitness programmes in diverting young people from crime.
GPs are beginning to warm to the idea of prescribing certain patients
a programme of exercise at a local sports centre or club. Both
initiatives call for an increase in specialist fitness professionals.
But for Paul Sheddon, 28, being a centre assistant at the Allander
Sports Centre is simply doing the thing he likes best: ''I get real job
satisfaction,'' he said, recalling the frustration of a previous job in
the Civil Service where he was stuck behind a desk all day, his love of
sport relegated to the corners of his life.
Paul's supervisor, Ronald Hewitson, 30, finds it refreshing to be
challenged by something new every day. ''It's really interesting, doing
sport, coaching, setting things up and mixing with the people,'' he
said. ''It's also a nice atmosphere, working in a sports environment,
where people come to enjoy themselves.''
ILAM approves various courses offered by colleges and universities in
Scotland. For further information on courses of employment, contact

<HEADLINE>Budget excise duties help push up factory gate price data.  Pressure now on High Street</HEADLINE>

THERE was fresh evidence yesterday of price pressures clearly building
up at the factory gate level. If the trend continues it will eventually
feed through to prices in the shops, albeit tempered by consumer
resistance.
But the Retail Price Index tomorrow and the retail sales figures on
Thursday are much more likely to influence the future direction of
interest rate policy than what one analyst in the City described as ''a
moderately gloomy'' set of producer prices.
The factory price data upset the progress of the stock market only
briefly and share prices closed at their best level so far this year.
The dominant influence was the strength of Wall Street, which continued
to build on the 50-point advance by the Dow Jones index on Friday night.
By the close, the FTSE-100 share index had added 28.4 to 3076.7, but
with volumes thin market pundits are sceptical about the durability of
any rally.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of
the Bank of England, Eddie George, next meet on February 2, but with the
Bank's quarterly inflation report not due till the following week the
betting is that the next rise in interest rates will be deferred until
March at the earliest.
Addressing an audience of bankers and industrialists in Glasgow last
night, Mr George gave little away on the timing of future interest rate
changes.
Earlier, City economists were wrong footed by a 0.7% rise in the main
measure of factory gate price inflation in December. To some extent this
was because they had underestimated the effects of the Budget excise
duty increases on prices.
Most had expected an increase of just 0.4% on the month, though James
Capel's Adam Cole was closer to the mark with a forecast of 0.6%.
The Central Statistical Office, which compiles the figures, said that
the Budget hikes in excise duties would have added 0.7% to the index in
December if passed on in full. But it noted that the price of petroleum
products rose by less than the estimated Budget effects. Overall, this
suggests that producers saw little need to absorb some of the excise
duty increases.
The mini-Budget, necessitated by the Government's defeat on the second
tranche of VAT on domestic fuel, is expected to add around 0.4% to the
index this month.
As a result of the December rise, the main measure of factory gate
price inflation edged up to 2.6% from November's 2.5%. There will be
some concern about the immediate outlook. January is the month when
producers traditionally push through increases in list prices.
For the second month in a row the seasonally adjusted index, which
excludes the food, drink, tobacco, and petroleum sectors, sported a
higher annual inflation rate than the broadly based index.
Here prices rose by 0.3% last month, and the annual rate moved up from
2.6% to 2.8%. The big worry is that in the seasonally adjusted index,
the increase in the latest three months over the previous three months
was equivalent to an annual rate of 4.5%. The equivalent figure for
November was 4.2%.
This short-run indicator has been flashing warning signals of
inflation in the pipeline in recent months and reinforces other evidence
that manufactuirers are trying to raise prices as demand improves.
For most of last year, industry's materials and fuels costs rose on
the back of hardening commodity and import prices. Last month industry's
input prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.4%, but the annual
percentage rate was unchanged at 8.3%. A year earlier, the year-on-year
rate was minus 1.4%.
But the strength of productivity gains and the low level of pay awards
have offset this added burden. It may be that manufacturers are seeking
to improve, rather than restore, their margins, which have held up well.
The key question is whether they will get away with it. Both producers
and retailers have enjoyed little success in pushing up prices without
damaging sales so far.
In November, the retail price of household goods rose by 1% and of
clothing and footwear by 0.5%. Tomorrow's inflation data will be closely
monitored to see if the increases held and if they did, what effect this
had on High Street trade when the December sales figures are published
on Thursday.

HOUSE of Fraser is to close three stores with the loss of around 500
full and part-time jobs, news of which left the shares down 3p at 167p,
additionally disappointed by word of pressure on margins.
The group has decided to close three units, the Binns stores in South
Shields and Bridlington and the Rackhams outlet in Bradford because it
believes their long-term future is ''severely limited''. Costs of
closure, including the already announced shutdown in Newcastle, will be
#2m, to be provided for in the current year accounts.
Sales in the six weeks before Christmas were 10% ahead of the previous
year and House of Faser said the January sale had begun well, though
sales have softened as the month has progressed.
The seasonally mild weather up to early December depressed sales of
winter woollies and the like so that heavy discounting was needed to
match prices of rivals.
''This factor has been a major contributor to an erosion of margins
which will affect the overall result,'' the group stated.
The news caused analysts to scale down their forecasts for current
year profits so that now only a little more than the previous year's
#34.5m is expected. The shares are standing at a discount to April's
180p flotation price, having been as high as 248p.
House of Fraser saw the strongest sales gain in stores which have
recently been refurbished. This year a further 11 stores will undergo
major refurbishment, following the 12 which received the treatment in
1994. A new 120,000 sq ft outlet in Swindon is planned to open in autumn
1996.
* ANOTHER department store chain, Allders, said its sales were 7.2% up
in December, with the total for the 15 weeks to January 14 5.8% ahead.
On a like-for-like basis, they advanced 4.3%.
''This is a good result achieved in demanding conditions,'' said chief
executive Harvey Lipsith. ''Christmas and the January sales are
important times for us and I am delighted that the results demonstrate
convincingly the strength of our business.''

WEST of Scotland Labour MPs reacted angrily to what the Scottish
Office yesterday called '' a new package of measures'' following the
floods in the area.
Ministers said they would provide #10,000 to fund a study into the
causes of the recent extensive flooding in the West of Scotland.
They are also to grant Renfrew District Council flexibility amounting
to #1.85m in the management of its housing budget to allow the Ferguslie
Park housing project, delayed by the floods, to make progress.
The comprehensive hydrological study is being prepared by the Clyde
River Purification Board, and Ministers are ready to support other
studies into the flooding.
Local Government Minister Allan Stewart also promised that if
Strathclyde Regional Council comes up with new schemes to prevent flood
prevention the Scottish Office will meet 50% of the cost of any scheme
approved by the Secretary of State.
Mr Gordon McMaster, Labour MP for Paisley South, said: ''This is very
disappointing. The Government seems willing to give assistance as long
as it doesn't cost anything.''
Both he and Mr Sam Galbraith, Labour MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden,
said the study for which the Government had announced funding probably
was the least important to be carried out as it would not be able to
look into the whole river system.
Mr McMaster said the technical flexibility given to Renfrew's budget
was welcome.
However, it did not represent any new money to the council from the
Government.
''It is no more than an accountancy exercise,'' he said.
Mr Galbraith said the statement ignored many areas in Strathclyde,
like his own and Cunninghame, which had been hard-hit by the floods.
His constituency had 271 homes affected by the flooding in areas like
Kirkintilloch and Torrance and Bardowie.
Last night, in an adjourment debate he called for Government to take
speedy action to prevent flooding in Strathkelvin in future.
Mr McMaster said that, despite the Scottish Office offer of 50%
funding for any new approved flood prevention scheme from Strathclyde,
the fact was that schemes had been submitted in the past and never
approved.
Scottish Office officials are working urgently on new national
guidelines for local councils on how to minimise the risk to prpoperty
from flooding.
Mr Stewart said the flexibilty the department will allow Renfrew
council meant that the houing programmes for Ferguslie Park which were
delayed by the flooding could progess through 1995 and 1996.
The council will be alllowed to carry forward any underspending of its
housing revenue account up to the maximum 10% which can be authorised.
The Minister soon is to meet Mr McMaster to discuss the MP's Natural
Disasters (Scotland) Bill which would provide for extra Government help
when areas are hit by future by unusualy severe conditions.

THE GOVERNOR of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, last night
sought to allay fears that interest rates will be lifted to the levels
of the past.
Addressing the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland Biennial
Dinner in Glasgow he said ''that on all the information available to us,
there is, in our view, no reason to suppose that this need be the
case.''
He continued, ''We have seen a measured tightening of monetary policy
now -- and you have to go back more than 20 years to find an instance
when there was a comparably measured tightening of policy -- to try to
ensure that the the early and limited signs of a pick up in inflation
that we have seen so far do not intensify; and we introduced that policy
tightening precisely in order to avoid having to jerk up interest rates
later.''
The Governor said he could not, in all honesty, say whether or when
policy will need to be tightened again.
He told the bankers, ''retail price inflation will probably be a bit
higher for a few months because of the timing of indirect tax tax
changes. But what happens to underlying inflation beyond that will
depend on upon how the economy develops, which will in turn depend
largely on the decisions we all take as producers and consumers,
emloyers and employees. The Bank will not, in its advice to the
Chancellor, take risks with inflation.''
Mr George also defended the base rate rises imposed in September and
December.Commodity prices, said the Governor, rose strongly in the first
half of last year, though have become more stable since; and there were
emerging capacity constraints in some basic material sectors.
He said that despite strong resistence to these pressures passing down
the chain in to retail prices, some of the pressure has begun to feed
through into producer output prices, though not, or at least not yet,
into retail prices.
The Governor said it was a misconception that the UK economy was
sluggish and stressed that it was important not to exaggerate the
weakness of consumer spending which, on the latest data, is nevertheless
growing at around its trend rate.
Explaining the Bank's policy on interest rates as a stitch in time to
save nine, Mr George added, ''That description is particularly apt when
you appreciate that 9% is just about the peak level of short-term
interest rates over the next few years implied by the financial
markets.''
''Providing we keep inflation at bay -- by acting early, before it can
take hold -- we have a real opportunity of making the breakthrough to
steady and sustained growth which has eluded us for so long.''

A COUPLE of deft deals helped boost the capital performance of
Abtrust's Scottish Investment Company (ASIC) to more than three times
the increase in the main benchmark indices.
Announcing figures for the six months to end-November, ASIC said net
asset value per share rose 6.1% to 43.6p compared with a rise of 1.8% in
both NatWest Securities Venture Capital index and the FTSE All-Share
index.
The capital appreciation stemmed mainly from the realisation of two
highly profitable transactions. The takeovers of Wm Low by Tesco and
Scotcare by CrestaCare generated profits of #2m on initial investment of
just over #1m.
Aberdeen-based ASIC, a #29m investment trust which focuses on unquoted
companies from the northeast of Scotland, also pointed out that the GRT
bus group, another of its favourites, had seen its share price rise by
some 40% since flotation last May.
However, the most eye-catching deal was surely the purchase of Wm Low
shares at 160p in May and their sale barely one month later at 360p when
Tesco's bid ran its course.
Such transactions are the dream of fund managers and the #700,000
profit was beaten only by the #1.3m made from the Scotcare deal, albeit
over a period of several years.
Meanwhile, pre-tax profits rocketed from #28,000 to #235,000 as cash
flow and dividends in the largely unquoted companies held by ASIC
increased amid improve trading.
''Our holdings have performed exceptionally well under the
circumstances and we are confident the trend will continue this year,''
Abtrust's Hugh Little said yesterday.
His confidence is supported by deals concluded after the reporting
period. These include: a #1.8m investment in the Pentex oil company
which has subsequently floated on the Stock Exchange and a #500,000
slice of the Nevis group, a corporate recovery firm.
Devanha, a cable television company, has also improved its status in
the portfolio by floating as Caledonian Communications. A #250,000
profit is already seen by the trust's managers.

The Labour MEPs who have endorsed the defence of Clause 4 of the
Labour Party's constitution deserve the heartiest of congratulations.
They echo the sincere and honest views of thousands of Labour Party
members and voters who believe that the goal of any self-respecting
socialist party must be the elimination of production for private profit
and its replacement by an economic system based on production to meet
people's needs.
Clause 4 meets these aspirations and in so doing confronts the
selfishness and greed that is the moving force behind the market
economy. The message contained in this small part of the Labour Party's
constitution is therefore full of moral strength and is a statement of
which the party should be proud. Far from containing an old-fashioned
and decaying concept, Clause 4 presents a progressive, challenging, and
exciting plan for the future.

Is the New Labour Party a democratic organisation or a dictatorship?
It appears to me that Tony Blair is now enforcing his Tory opinions on
the majority of his party. He is blackmailing some of them into silence
by threats that opposition to him is disloyalty to him and ipso facto
disloyalty to his party.
The Labour Party has been so long out of office that it is obviously
willing to sacrifice all of its remaining socialist principles in an
attempt to persuade a few southern yuppies to change from Tory to
Labour.
Tony Blair dumped the unions, supported water privatisation in
England, sent his son to a grant-aided school, abandoned Clause 4, and
promised to give Scotland the same status as an English region.
Despite all this, the fickle few in the South, who might support him
just now, will abandon him just as soon as the Tories cut their taxes
and provide them with an opportunity to make some quick cash out of
selling more of the people's hard-earned assets.

Surely the Sutherland family must now be embarrassed and appalled that
their despicable ancestor and his evictions can be equated in some minds
with Auschwitz or Treblinka and their death ovens (January 10).
It must be better that they rescue his statue and give it refuge in
Dunrobin Castle away from public hatred. This would leave the 60ft
plinth as both a memorial to the suffering of the Clearances and a
landmark for those who wish to preserve that function.

Sara Villiers looks back over a decade at the Tron Theatre with
artistic director Michael Boyd.
TEN years sounds like a good cause to pause, but Michael Boyd --
celebrating a decade as artistic director of the Tron Theatre this year
-- is too busy planning the particulars of the theatre's spring
programme to indulge in any self-congratulation or time-out.
When cornered he puffs his way through a pack of cigarettes with all
the frantic panic which a man who has announced ''well, I'm about to
give up smoking'' can muster, and reflects on an anniversary which
timeously coincides with the Tron kirk's bicentenary.
In the topsy-turvy world of arts appointments his is a lengthy tenure
and one which he intends to stick with. Since the mid-eighties he has
won increasing national recognition as a director, with freelance
requests coming in thick and fast, but he regards the Tron as the
perfect working environment.
He has just turned down a chance to direct Richard III for the Royal
Shakespeare Company this summer because the dates clashed with his Tron
adaptation of Janice Galloway's The Trick Is To Keep Breathing,
previously showcased in a one-off performance last year.
While keen to continue an association with the RSC -- he recently
directed a new production of John Ford's The Broken Heart for them which
is currently playing at Stratford -- he declares: ''There was no
question in my mind that The Trick Is To Keep Breathing was a more
exciting opportunity.''
Opportunity was what attracted Boyd to the Tron in the first place,
wooed by the combination of a desire to return to Scotland and the
challenge of being in control. After studying at Edinburgh University he
had spent a year as a trainee director at Moscow's Malay Bronnaya
Theatre in 1979, followed by productive stints at Coventry -- where the
lethargy of senior directors afforded him the now almost-inconceivable
opportunity of directing 10 shows in one year -- and at the Crucible in
Sheffield.
There are various reasons why he has stayed: the creative support of
general manager David Taylor, the proximity of the RSAMD turning out
talented young actors, the flexibility of a producing house/receiving
venue and the co-operation of a far-sighted board who have often given
the green light to innovative, risky projects -- most notably Crow,
Boyd's adaptation of Ted Hughes' poetry in 1990.
He has directed many adventurous projects -- some unforgettable
successes, some consigned to oblivion -- but his biggest challenge was
undoubtedly that of persuading the powers-that-be to go public. When he
took up the position of the first artistic director at the Tron it was
with the determination to expand the private theatre club which served a
relatively small if committed membership to one which played a major
role in the city's theatrical provision. It seems an obvious step now
but met with considerable opposition at the time.
''Yes, there was initial resistance,'' says Boyd. ''I think the Tron
was born as a co-operative enterprise by a lot of people who were
sceptical that the world at large would give a shit about the Tron. I
was more optimistic. Okay, we wouldn't have the cushion of the
solidarity of membership fees and that was a very important part of our
income at one stage but it became less important as our box office
takings went up in leaps and bounds.''
Personal highlights of his decade include directing Brian Friel's
Philadelphia Here I Come in 1987, 92's cult panto Cinderella, written by
and starring Forbes Masson alongside Jimmy Chisholm, Robert Paterson,
and Bob Carr, and directing the same bunch in last year's Mayfest
spectacular Dumbstruck.
He's still proud of the intensity of Crow, staged in a claustrophobic
wardrobe space in the upstairs courtyard -- a one-off due to licensing
restrictions.
''Crow is still bubbling away in my head,'' he notes. ''We may yet
revive it in a different space. I went to Moscow in 91 with the
intention of staging it there but it had become a place of such anarchic
chaos that I decided it wasn't the point to do art there. Perhaps I was
beginning to lose some of the bleak romanticism that had taken me out to
Moscow in the first place and I was getting more into the idea of going
to New York and Montreal and less into the idea of self-punitively
visiting Moscow.''
New York and Montreal are place names stamped on the Boyd passport due
to an association with the Quebecois playwright Michel Trembley. The
Tron's Scots adaptations of Trembley's work, directed by Boyd, were
applauded both at home and abroad. The Guid Sisters, boasting a pedigree
cast of Scotland's finest actresses, appeared at the World Stage
Festival in Toronto in 1990 and The Real Wurld?'s invitation to the New
York International Theatre Festival in 91 subsidised its production in
Glasgow.
The co-production of Macbeth with Dundee Rep, starring Iain Glen, was
another feather in the Boyd cap and he retains a fondness for the
company's version of C P Taylor's Good for the Edinburgh International
Festival in 92: ''I felt very proud of its use of music and movement,''
he explains. ''Nobody moved in a way which wasn't intensely expressive,
or that wasn't choreographed minutely. I think that's a legacy of my
Russian training -- if anyone moves on stage it must mean something and
if it doesn't, then stand still please!''
Aspects of the turnover he regrets is a past eagerness to churn out
pieces to heighten the Tron's profile as a producer, resulting in the
staging of new plays like Peter Arnott's Salvation in 1990 and Chris
Hannan's Baby in the same year ''before they were quite ready.''
These days he tries to ensure a longer gestation period for
productions and is more interested in ''the more courageous act of
putting all our eggs in one basket'' with annual high-calibre
productions like 93's Macbeth, 94's Dumbstruck, and the forthcoming The
Trick Is To Stop Breathing, starring singer Eddi Reader.
''Mind you,'' he muses. ''I've stopped moaning about the lack of
opportunity in Britain to do the kind of work that they do in Europe,
and that they did in Russia when I was there and that Peter Brook has
galvanised for himself. You have to be pragmatic. Now I just think,
well, we'll work towards that.'' He adds ruefully: ''Although I'm sure
I'll have left the Tron before we have two years rehearsal period.''
I venture that we'll probably both have quit this world before
two-year rehearsals become the norm in this country, but he smiles
defiantly and the optimistic streak which has carried him through the
past 10 years comes to the fore: ''Well, I'm going to rehearse something
for two years before I die.''

MY flirtation with the game of football, stretching for more than half
a century, is seldom allowed to intrude on this column. But today must
be an exception -- the day when one of my all-time heroes bows out of
the game he has graced with such skill and artistry as to guarantee him
a place in Scotland's Hall of Fame.
The retirement of Gordon David Strachan OBE, who has survived to the
eve of his 38th birthday, reminds us of ball-playing skills which seem
to be disappearing from the Scottish scene.
I don't know if eras begin or end with particular people but
yesterday's news that the Edinburgh lad who rose to fame with Aberdeen,
Manchester United, and Leeds will play no more seemed like a watershed
which stirred a longing for a lost art.
The fact that Glasgow Rangers are dominating Scottish football without
rising above the level of mediocrity merely underlines that cry for the
artistic tanner-ba' player who was once so much a feature of the
national sport.
Gordon Strachan was the classy entertainer who harnessed his
individuality to the greater good of the team, always in the thick of
creativity and, in all my years of following Aberdeen, undoubtedly the
greatest play-maker I have seen at Pittodrie.
Writing books about footballers is not my top priority but I made an
exception in the case of Strachan. It was then that I really came to
know the wee redhead from a tough district of Edinburgh who made his own
decision, mature beyond his years, to reject the overtures of the great
Manchester United until he had proved his worth.
It would be much more than a decade before he finally landed with
England's top club. In the meantime he was an apprentice with Dundee
before moving on to Aberdeen in 1977.
I can still remember the first time I set eyes on him, an experience
reminiscent of seeing the great Jimmy Johnstone of Celtic. I was writing
the history of Aberdeen Football Club and there was just room to include
his name.
By the time I updated that history he had become a legend of
Pittodrie, a key figure in that golden decade in which manager Alex
Ferguson took Aberdeen from the domesticity of Scotland to the heights
of Europe, where the Dons were hailed as the top team of 1983.
On the way to winning the European Cup Winners Cup in Gothenburg that
year, Strachan and his team-mates were in the Sheraton Hotel, Munich,
savouring an outstanding result against the great Bayern. Over a drink
that night he took me aside and gingerly asked if I would write his
book.
Immaculate timing
Players of that calibre sense their own destiny. If Aberdeen were
heading for the highest point of their history, logic would tell you
that a player like Strachan would soon be on his way to greater
pastures. His timing for the book, like the quality of his passes, was
immaculate.
As a subject for ghost-writing, Gordon Strachan was the absolute
model. Week after week I would turn up at his home in Aberdeen to find
him bristling with ideas for the next chapter. The sharpness of his mind
astounded me, since the more common experience of footballing genius is
that it comes in inverse ratio to articulateness. Strachan was the
classic exception.
On top of all that, I found him one of the nicest of human beings, a
cheery, good-natured, and compassionate husband and father. There was no
bitterness, only sadness, at the vitriol poured over him from the
terracings of a game where reason is a stranger.
On two occasions I saw him physically attacked on the field by
opposing supporters. On a regular basis he suffered a verbal abuse which
he learned to absorb. What he could not abide were the attacks on his
charming wife, Lesley, if she happened to be in the grandstand.
I remember a day in Glasgow when he heard a particularly offensive
chant and he confessed it had put him completely off his game. It didn't
delay his departure from Scotland either.
The explanation was that Gordon Strachan personified the impertinence
of a team outwith Glasgow to challenge the monopoly of the big two.
Not that he escaped the censure of some Aberdonians, who are known for
an underdeveloped vocal support. I remember a day at Pittodrie when he
beat two Motherwell players with ease and proceeded towards goal.
''Get rid o' the ba', ye selfish wee bugger,'' shouted a dour
supporter beside me. Instead, the wee man went on to beat two more
opponents before scoring a glorious goal.
As the crowd rose in acclaim, the sour-face beside me sat unmoved. He
waited till the noise had subsided and then piped up again: ''And ye're
still a selfish wee bugger, Strachan!''
The morons survive. But most of the Strachans have gone. I celebrated
with him on Aberdeen's greatest night in Gothenburg and again when he
won his English cup medal with Manchester United at Wembley. From there
he took over the captaincy of lowly Leeds, brought them up to the top
English division and carried off the championship.
Gordon Strachan was not only a great little footballer and distinctive
character. He has been a great little Scot, an example to the young --
and yes, my hero.

ONLY a terminal fusspot couldn't have found something to enjoy here.
''Music for enthusiasts, for music lovers, and for fanatics'' is how
Radio Scotland's Iain Anderson introduced the Piping Concert, whose
central feature was the unveiling of Hamish Moore's Pictish triple
pipes, which he made himself from drawings found on ancient stones.
First-night nerves along with the demanding technique required (it
involves circular breathing, using his mouth as the ''bag'') meant it
was the last piece before Moore really relaxed and let us hear the full
impact of this strange, middle-eastern-sounding instrument. But it was
well worth the wait. Either side of Moore, Kathryn Tickell (Northumbrian
pipes), Liam O Flynn (uillean pipes), and Fred Morrison and Gordon
Duncan (Highland pipes) gave astonishing individual displays.
After such undiluted virtuosity Shooglenifty's energetic, dance-floor
filling rockin' and reelin' was the perfect chaser. Good-time stuff this
may be but there's always something interesting going on for those who
prefer just to listen rather than leap around.
A typically eclectic set from the Poozies (from XTC songs to waulking
songs) was preceded by more virtuosity from flautist Brian Finnegan,
playing tunes from Ireland, Brittany, and Scotland, and fun from the
French Alligators whose dancing compensated for their rather polite,
one-paced cajun music.
The music continued until well past midnight with the wonderful Irish
choir, Anuna, whose singing of songs both ancient (going back to the
ninth century) and just old (a nice tribute to Altan's Frankie Kennedy
with the Lass of Glenshee) re-emphasised the human voice's primative
power to knock you off your feet.

THERE was some improvement in the growth in retail sales in December
after the relative sluggishness of the preceding two months, according
to the CBI Distributive Trades Survey.
However, the survey shows that retailers expect sales to rise more
slowly in the year to January, and sales for the time of year are
expected to be slightly below average.
In December, the balance of retailers reporting higher sales volumes,
less those reporting lower volumes, was a positive 19% compared with 6%
in November and minus 3% in October.
The CBI said sales for the time of year are regarded as average for
the first time since last July and better than expected in November.
Taken together, reported sales in the last three months of 1994 suggest
a more even pattern of growth in High Street trade in the Christmas run
up.
Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's Distributive Trades Survey
Panel, said: ''Retail trade in December proved to be as healthy as the
November survey predicted''.
The year finished on a more positive note for many retailers as
competitive prices encouraged buying.
Most retail sectors reported some sales growth in the year to
December. Largest rises were in footwear, leather, and clothing shops,
followed by hardware, china and DIY retailers. Only specialist food
retailers, such as butchers, bakers, and greengrocers, reported a big
decline in year-on-year sales.
For wholesaling, sales volumes increased strongly in the year to
December.
The volume of orders placed on suppliers also rose sharply on an
annual basis but stock levels remain more than adequate in relation to
expected demand. Looking ahead, sales volumes are expected to rise at a
moderate rate.
Motor traders' sales volumes stayed relatively flat. Sales for the
time of year also remained well below average -- although to a lesser
extent than at any time since last August.
Sales volumes are expected to fall slightly again in the year to
January.

AMERICAN policy-makers in the Middle East are finding it difficult to
keep their allies in step. Gulf states (apart from Kuwait) already think
that a different attitude is needed over Iraqi sanctions, especially now
that they have the job of selling the Israeli-Palestinian accord to
their own citizens. They could have a point. The UN-imposed sanctions
against Iraq seem as far as ever from affecting Saddam Hussein. They do
affect Iraqis, but unless their suffering is supposed to lead them to
revolt and bring down their dictator -- a most improbable outcome --
that fact is more or less ignored in Baghdad. When the successful
coalition refused to take Baghdad itself and topple Saddam directly, it
ensured his continuance in power. Many may have hoped that overwhelming
military defeat might have brought Saddam down anyway, as would have
occurred in almost any Western state. That did not happen and Saddam's
latest propaganda efforts suggest that he has shrugged off the effects
of Desert Storm. In that case the result of the continued application of
UN sanctions is merely to injure further the mass of Iraqis whose lot is
already very poor. There is a strong humanitarian case for rescinding
sanctions, though those who back them are loth to admit they have not
worked.
Gulf Arab rulers are under few illusions about Saddam Hussein (their
domestic opinion is another matter) but they remain more worried about
the Iranians, where again the Americans are finding it hard to maintain
a united line against the Rafsanjani regime. The Japanese, for example,
seem about to recommence the supply of large soft (that is low-interest)
loans to fund major Iranian developmental projects. The Americans do not
like that. The Iranians seem to have had no difficulty in funding from
their domestic resources large developments designed to exploit nuclear
energy. They have bought, cheaply as such things go, much plant and
know-how from Russia; and some observers fear that within five rather
than 10 years they will have the capacity to manufacture a nuclear
device. They already have Chinese-designed rocket delivery systems.
Of course the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is not the
same as the acquisition of a military capability. The distinction is
profound mentally but not so much technically. The North Korean
capability is a case in point; and nearer the Middle East both India and
Pakistan are thought to have military nuclear capacities which grew out
of civil programmes. Civil nuclear plants tend to produce weapons-grade
material as a by-product: one thing leads to another. In Iran's case,
the Americans would say, it will lead to a state which sponsors
international terrorism having terrible weapons at its disposal. Gulf
Arab states may fear Iranian blackmail across the Gulf itself, but a
more likely target for nuclear threats would be Israel. The last time
the Israelis suspected that they might encounter this possibility (from
Iraq) they took pre-emptive action. That they might do so again hardly
contributes to Middle Eastern stability, but neither does an Iranian
nuclear strike capacity.

LABOUR is preparing to challenge the Government to renegotiate the
European Union fishing deal in a key debate in the Commons tomorrow..
However, spokesman Gavin Strang stopped short of calling for Britain to
quit the Common Fisheries Policy.
His draft motion on this key issue seeks to attract the support of
Northern Ireland MPs and some English Tories.
It states that the present agreement struck by the Government is ''an
unacceptable threat to the long-term economic viability of fishing
communities in England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland it places
an unsustainable pressure upon the fish stocks in these already
sensitive waters.''
Labour is to call on the Government to try to raise again the issue in
the highest ministerial councils of the EU, claiming that the Common
Fisheries Policy is undermined by the deal struck so far allowing the
large Spanish fishing fleet into the western waters of the UK.
This highly sensitive issue is to be debated in the Commons tomorrow
night on Labour's motion which seeks to combine the hostile views of MPs
on all sides who represent fishing communities.

Jay Carr meets the one-time young hustler who refuses to sink into the
cinematic sunset
PAUL NEWMAN will turn 70 on January 26. His hair has turned white, his
manner ruminative, mellower, less edgy than it used to be. Ask him how
he's doing when you run into him in a hotel elevator and he says:
''Splattered,'' smiling and looking anything but.
Those electrifying cobalt-blue eyes still twinkle with mischief. On
Broadway and in Hollywood -- in roles ranging from Sweet Bird of Youth
through The Hustler, Hud, Harper, Hombre, Cool Hand Luke, The Verdict
and his Oscar-winning The Color of Money -- he has been America's
longest-running rebel.
When acting, directing, and political activism didn't exorcise his
demons, he turned to auto racing. Now -- in life as in his new film,
Robert Benton's Nobody's Fool -- Newman is a rebel in twilight.
Not that he's exactly sinking into the west in some cinematographer's
sunset. He still races cars, but five crashes in his last six races
(''Somebody is giving me advice'') are sparking a renewed interest in
badminton, he wryly notes.
Wry self-puncturing irony is a favourite Newman mode. He jokes that
his lines of salad dressings, spaghetti sauce and popcorn outgrosses his
movies -- making light of the fact that the proceeds support an
increasing number of the Hole-in-the-Wall camps he founded to serve kids
with cancer and other life-threatening diseases.
He has just begun pre-production on a new Western he is directing, and
he's relieved to be free of youthful handsomeness. Being perceived as an
American acting icon gives him more acting space than being viewed as a
mere hunk ever did, he goes on to explain -- though either term is
enough to make him wince.
Newman was always entertaining in the cocky working-class-guy roles of
his youth and early middle age. But since The Verdict, Absence of
Malice, Fort Apache, the Bronx, The Color of Money and Mr and Mrs
Bridge, he has become that rarity among American actors -- the artist
who has not only been permitted to age, but allowed to deepen. These
days he plays experience, not just attitude.
His Fast Eddie Felson was much more interesting as a man bearing a
weight of experience in the sequel to The Hustler than he was the first
time around, when you wanted Jackie Gleason's Minnesota Fats to hang on
for one more big win.
So it is in Nobody's Fool, where he plays Sully, a wary lone wolf and
sometime construction worker in a town in upstate New York, belatedly
coming to grips with family ties. ''I think the character gives up
erratic and eccentric behaviour that he thinks is male behaviour in
order to assume his responsibilities,'' Newman says.
A switch from most of Newman's other roles, no? ''I didn't have to
work very hard on this part,'' he replies, seated at a table in his
suite, trying to work up interest in a salad plate. ''It's closer to me
than I care to admit. That trajectory he took to go from aloof and
distant and hands-off to available, involved, and accessible was very
close to a journey I had to take.
''This profession builds up a kind of armour. It keeps people at a
distance that is required for survival. So I had enough to draw on.
''For a long time this guy only heard his own drummer. He was aloof
and distant. Then there was this unexpected sensation when he picked his
young grandson up out of that truck, the bed of that truck, and sat him
down. That caught him unawares. And he was smart enough to honour that
and to pursue and be curious about it. Things like that don't happen in
real life. Usually, they happen more imperceptibly, but for the uses of
drama, this is OK. Does that make sense?
''The key word is unsuspecting. At some point when he was vulnerable,
this unexpected sensation got a hold of him. It had to do with family,
and sons, and he simply allowed it -- after years of not allowing it. He
didn't invite it, he didn't insist on it, he just allowed it to blossom,
just to see what the hell the flower would look like. And then at some
point, he became part of the human family. He was just standing there
until his grandson landed.
''God, how long-winded -- I hope you'll compress this! But the thing
I'm trying to say is that this veil of protection -- well, you know, if
your appearance is right, you can go through life being treated like an
object.
''And when that's amplified by the profession you join, you'd be
surprised at the amount of armour that you can erect around you to
protect that part of you sitting there, waiting around to get looked
at.''
The generational traffic is two-way -- or rather, partly two-way,
Newman says. He will talk about his own father, who ran a sporting-goods
store in Cleveland, and whose death brought Newman back from his first
season of summer stock to run the business.
''He was funny, erudite, hard-working, extremely ethical -- and
distant,'' Newman says, describing the late Arthur Newman. Was his
father accessible? ''Not to me he wasn't, no.'' Until recent years, this
was a pattern Newman found himself playing out as a father. He and his
actress wife, Joanne Woodward -- married since 1958, when they starred
in The Long Hot Summer, have three grown-up daughters.
Newman has two other daughters from a first marriage; a son, Scott,
died from an accidental overdose of alcohol and Valium in 1978. This
prompted the grief-stricken Newman to establish a charitable foundation
in his son's name.
Newman's way is to cover his seriousness and his work ethic with
self-deflating glibness, usually with an ironic curl of the lip. He
jokes that he turned to acting in his junior year at Kenyon College
because he was kicked off the football team after spending a night in
jail following a bar-room brawl, and that he went to Yale for further
acting study so he could escape the sporting-goods store.
After clicking on Broadway, Newman writhed when he landed in Hollywood
as a contract player, hoping his friends wouldn't see him in films like
The Silver Chalice. As soon as he could, he bought his way out of his
contract.
''Work is easier now,'' he says, expanding on the liberating aspects
of aging. ''As one wall falls down, it exposes a comfort in some area
that you hadn't explored, and it's cumulative. I have in some ways an
enviable position. I always think of stardom as a function of youth.
''And my age is catching up with me, because, if my success was based
upon youth and appearance, then at some point'' -- now he chuckles at
the prospect -- ''producers are going to have to sit up and take notice
that my age is something they will not be able to disregard.''
These days, it's not an issue that Newman and Woodward have for years
lived in a remodelled eighteenth-century farmhouse outside Westport,
Connecticut, and keep a Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan. But many
film-biz types used to whine that the couple were conspicuously setting
themselves apart from Hollywood.
''I don't think we came East because we were running away from
something,'' he says. ''I came East to go to Yale and bonded with the
city pretty quickly. My wife, too. And we just lived here. When I go to
California, people say, 'Why don't you live in California?' When people
come from California to New York, I don't say, 'Why aren't you living in
New York?'
''People live where they want to be. It's just where you happen to
hook up. I happened to hook up in the East and I love it historically.
It's not a vote against any single community, it's just a vote for some
place where you want to live. It just never occurred to me to be
anywhere else.''
Speaking of voting, Newman's long-time political activism -- which
began when he stuffed envelopes for Adlai Stevenson, has since sent him
as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention and the United
Nations -- and yielded a political satire, ''WUSA'', about a right-wing
radio station in the South -- is on the back burner.
''I'm immobilised by the incoherence of it all,'' he says of
contemporary politics. ''And the partisanship and the lack of loyalty
and the self-glorification, and the fact that everybody's busy
protecting their own turf. And this in a time when we need to reinvent
the country. With campaign reform first and foremost.
''Then welfare reform, health reform, a coherent military thing, the
acceptance of taxes as the price of civilization. And the return to the
concept that the community is more important than the individual. I'll
make a lot of friends on this, boy. I can get assassinated on this!''
What he'd rather do is go back to writing and directing. The directing
urge was stepped up, he says, when he caught himself watching his
Nobody's Fool co-stars -- Melanie Griffith, Bruce Willis and the late
Jessica Tandy -- with a director's eye as well as an acting colleague's.
Especially Tandy, who died after filming was completed: ''The most
stunning thing to me was that there was never anything between you and
her,'' he recalls. ''There were no gauzes, no shutters, nothing. Well,
when you know who you are, I guess that's pretty easy. It's the rest of
us . . .,'' he adds, voice trailing away, feeling no need to go into
detail about our imperfections.
''I'm at the point where I don't have to worry a lot about the future.
So I kind of do whatever it is that I want to. I'm not cluttered up by
what I think I ought to do. I promise you there's only one thing for
sure, and that is that I have no plans. It's whimsical, it almost always
depends upon the material. And if I like it, I simply do it. I don't
care much about the consequences.''
Ask Newman what he'd like to be remembered for, and he says simply for
being a man who was part of his time. He is not weighed down with
regrets, he says -- at least, there are fewer than if he regularly
channel-surfed through his films.
''I don't like to look at them,'' he says. ''I keep thinking of what I
shoulda' done, woulda' done, coulda' done.'' He wishes there were more
on which he and Woodward could collaborate. They haven't appeared on
screen together since Mr and Mrs Bridge. Having directed her in Rachel,
Rachel, The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds, The
Shadow Box and The Glass Menagerie, he says they're on the lookout for
new scripts, but so far nothing has shown up.
Ask him about off-screen life with her and he replies: ''Most
difficult -- tough, cantankerous, delicious, lusty, disagreeable, fun,''
with a long, savouring pause between each word. ''It's a pleasant
spectrum to go back over. How we make it last is correct amounts of lust
and respect!''

SCOTLAND isn't having much joy with Dolores Keane. At last year's
Celtic Connections concert she could barely sing because of flu. On her
tour prior to that, same thing. Last night's set was only a few bars old
when it became clear that the flu bug had bitten again and that, once
more, we were not going to hear her at anything like her best.
Her voice coped reasonably well on songs such as Kieran Halpin's
Sister and Brother, with its near-football terracing chant of a chorus,
and on Dougie Maclean's Caledonia, where the band joined in, allowing
her to drop down in volume. But on songs where she was more exposed,
such as Teddy O'Neill or the tightrope walk that was Solid Ground, she
was struggling to hit the notes. It all made for uncomfortable listening
and the concert hall staff must be beginning to wonder if next year they
shouldn't just print a doctor's line instead of the optimistic blurb in
the brochure.
There's a sore-sounding throat in the Fureys, too, but that definitely
seems to be permanent. Singing The Night Ferry, Finbar sounded as if he
was paying dearly for the carousing the boat in question's 19-hour
sailing offered. Despite their intimation that they were leaving the
more sentimental songs behind there were still a lot of them around. But
whatever they're singing a little patience is always rewarded when
Finbar plays the uillean pipes. Whether playing at breakneck speed or on
a slow air he can really make the small hairs on the back of the neck
rise, and his piping ''workshop'' was priceless.

SOUNDTRACS, which makes audio equipment for professional markets at
its Glenrothes plant, is continuing to make sound progress, reporting
profits up 18% at #724,000 for the year to November 6.
A final dividend of 1.58p takes the total payout to 2.5p, from 2.4p.
Soundtracs chairman Todd Wells said the results reflected management
policies which would be maintained.
''These policies are founded on a considerable investment in staff, on
staff training, in plant, in marketing and, as in previous years, in
vigorous product development,'' he stated.
The current year will see installation of more robotic equipment at
Glenrothes to provide production capacity to meet the expected increase
in sales this year. Mr Wells said the investment would be made without
any major increase in borrowings.
Sales are up 70% in two years and current trading is similar to the
same period last year. Around 90% of sales are exported.

LORD Elphinstone, farmer and financier and the eighteenth holder of a
title created in 1509, has died. He was 41.
The only son of the late Rev Andrew Elphinstone and his wife Jean
Hambro, James Elphinstone succeeded to the title on the death in 1975 of
his unmarried uncle who farmed near Meigle in Perthshire.
He was educated at Eton and the Royal Agricultural College,
Cirencester.
Shortly after completing his studies, and as a consequence of
consecutive family deaths, he took over the running of the estate.
Decades earlier, the family had donated the ancestral home, Carberry
Tower, near Musselburgh, to the Church of Scotland.
In 1978, he married Willa, daughter of Major David and Lady Chetwode.
They had one daughter and three sons, of whom Alexander, the eldest,
succeeds to the barony.

A WEAK dollar has spoilt an otherwise pleasing set of results from
Remy Cointreau with global cognac sales rising by 4% by volume and 2.5%
by value in the nine months to December.
But the current month is crucial for the full year total as it
contains the Chinese new year and will account for perhaps 20% of total
world sales of cognac.
The 16.1% owned associate of Highland Distilleries in the six months
to September -- French companies report sales each quarter but financial
results only at half year intervals -- increased net profits by 5% to
Ffr135m or about #16m. But for the dollar, they would have been around
#24.5m.
Remy Martin cognacs more than maintained market share as global
volumes increased while wines and spirits were also well ahead. But
Cointreau had a tough time in Europe which was not completely offset by
rising US turnover.
Champagne volumes including the supreme Krug and the more affordable
Charles Heidsieck and Piper Heidsieck brands continue to increase and
while short term profitability is still not exciting -- it brought in
Ffr20m of last year's group income of Ffr918m -- it will soon begin to
benefit from lower grape prices.
The shares fell Ffr4.9 to Ffr180.1 which compares with the Ffr200 at
which the warrants can be exercised reflecting the Ffr70m foreign
exchange setback offset by Fr52m of exceptional profits from selling
property and old barrels. Market estimates are for an increase in full
year after tax profits increasing from FFr252m to about Ffr270m.
Joint managing director Francois Heriard Dubreuil said that the
relationship with Highland was a ''tremendous asset not only because it
has given Remy the distribution of a fabulous product (Famous Grouse)
but also because we are very happy to work with them.''
In the nine month period, Grouse sales through Remy had risen 14% by
volume with the Dutch and Italian markets signed up. Remy also
distributes Macallan internationally which has done particularly well in
the US.
The Orpar holding company whichis 30% owned by Highland could still
retain control of Remy as long as no more than seven million new shares
were issued which at current prices would bring in about #150m. Remy is
presently about 100% geared but the French banks are quite happy as the
stocks of maturing spirits and wines are steadily increasing in value
and approximate to the near #700m of debt.
Highland spent #19m in the last three months buying Remy shares afer
deciding to maintain its effective holding whenr the Heriard Dubreil
family injected its directly owned shares into Orpar.

A FORMER Moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, the
Rev Donald B Macleod, has died at his manse in Edinburgh. He was 65.
Born in Dornoch, ''D B'' was the son of a Free Presbyterian manse and
well connected within that distinctive tradition. The family's roots
were in Kishorn, Wester Ross. His father, the Rev Finlay Macleod,
pastored the Dornoch and Rogart congregation for many years and his
mother was a daughter of the celebrated Rev Donald Beaton, one of the
founding fathers of the Free Presbyterian Church, and after whom their
baby boy was named.
Always a shy, private man, Mr Macleod trained for the ministry of the
Free Presbyterian Church following service in the Merchant Navy. He was
inducted in October 1960 to the joint charge of Kinlochbervie and
Scourie and was the first Free Presbyterian minister to that
congregation.
In 35 years, D B Macleod pastored five congregations. He moved first
to London, then to Lairg and Bonar. After nearly two decades with the
Dingwall and Beauly congregation, he was settled in 1990 as minister in
Edinburgh.
The Edinburgh charge, not for the first time in its history, had been
abandoned by its pastor -- and the bulk of the people -- following the
secession of the Associated Presbyterian Churches in 1989. This followed
the disciplining of Edinburgh elder Lord Mackay of Clashfern by the
church courts for attending Requiem Mass. Mr Macleod moved the final
motion to confirm sentence at the Inverness Synod.
He now inherited, in Edinburgh, a reduced and shaken rump, still
denied the use of their own church at Gilmore Place.
The Free Presbyterians were few, yet the building was recovered from
the APC and work resumed.
It is, however, for his wider work in the Free Presbyterian Church
that Mr Macleod will be best remembered. In 1969, he succeeded his
cousin, the Rev R R Sinclair, as editor of the Free Presbyterian
Magazine.
In 1978, he was appointed as one of the church's three theological
tutors. He served twice as Moderator of Synod, in 1973 and 1986.
In 1990, as the church still reeled from the Lord Mackay affair, he
succeeded the Rev Donald MacLean as Clerk of Synod -- perhaps the most
powerful and important position in the church.
With all these responsibilities, Mr Macleod still found time to preach
about the country at communion seasons, and fulfil his pastoral duties
in Edinburgh. He took an intense and personal interest in the church's
African mission field.
Every spring, over the last few years of his life, he regularly flew
out to promote the work in Zambabwe, Kenya, and Malawi.
At the height of the Lord Mackay farrago, when manse phones were
slamming down across Scotland, he showed unfailing politeness to the
media.
Determined loyalty to the Free Presbyterian testimony -- exemplified
in some of his ferocious Notes and Comments in the Free Presbyterian
Magazine -- did not preclude his pleasure in fellowship with true
Christians of other backgrounds.
Mr Macleod is survived by his wife, Bunty, who is the daughter and
grand-daughter of two Free Church Moderators, and their four daughters.

THE 1980s were good years for British executives. Once the free-market
theories of the Conservative Government were up and running British
executive pay moved from the basement of the international pay league to
very near the top. By 1992 it had moved ahead of such countries as
Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, and Holland. Like most rapid
changes the effect went too far and too fast. Embarrassment over
executive pay is now a serious political issue of acute interest to the
Prime Minister as well as to the Opposition. The symbol of excessive pay
at the moment is the British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown, who
combined his 75% pay rise with proposals to cut the pay of British Gas
showroom workers. Mr Brown's pay rise was as ridiculous as the
explanations given for it. He is not the chief executive of a really
major international company, nor, in all probability, will he ever be.
Despite pressure his pay rise has been confirmed, but there are new
allegations that British Gas, although warned of the adverse effects of
its pay policies, has given senior managing directors rises which are
far ahead of inflation.
All of this makes the attempts by British industry to set its house in
order (or to apply sufficient coats of whitewash) of particular
interest. The Government declines to intervene but clearly wants
shareholders to exercise their opinions on the subject and their voting
rights at annual meetings. This may be taken as a hint, but if it refers
to any shareholders other than institutional ones it is quite useless.
Small shareholders can, and do, fight bravely at AGMs on issues which
move them, but they are powerless if the financial institutions, which
dominate shareholdings, are unwilling to participate. Institutional
passivity in the face of boardroom abuse is believed by some to have
exposed a serious hole in the system by which companies control their
executive affairs. If the shareholders can't or won't intervene the
directors have virtually no curbs on their behaviour.
Should we expect very much of the industry bodies which are examining
the problem? The Institute of Directors, once a symbol of the right in
business and political terms, but now busily repositioning itself for
what it fears may be a different political dispensation, will announce
its own recommendations on executive pay next week. It will also join
with other bodies on a CBI-led group which will seek to establish a code
of good practice in awarding pay rises. This body may care to examine
the proposal by Labour in the Lords to make an amendment to the Pensions
Bill which will require pension funds to vote on issues relating to
executive pay at AGMs. This would presumably please Mr Major, although
he will not like the element of coercion. Fund managers will like it
even less. They will claim that it would cost them large sums of money
in administration to enable them to vote at the AGMs of all the
companies in which they invest. This argument is overstated. A
requirement of this sort would bring British institutions into line with
those in America and would go some way towards convincing the public
that they are taking seriously their duties as shareholders.

TRADING volumes in the currency markets were quiet with many US banks
shut for the Martin Luther King holiday. However, underling trends
remained unchanged, with the dollar continuing to be negatively affected
by the growing perception that the US Federal Reserve will not now raise
US interest rates at the end of the month.
If US rates do not rise then the dollar could lose up to 5% of its
value as investors desert the currency. Today's publication of US
industrial production and capacity utilisation data will give a clue as
to the likely course of US interest rates.
Elsewhere, after a period of weakness, the Italian lira recovered some
composure in the wake of Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini's appointment
as Prime Minister-designate.Sterling ignored December UK producer prices
data and had a mixed tone. It dropped 0.29 to DM2.4014, but it was a
quarter cent better than the dollar at 1.5700.

January 10.
Councillor Rob Gibson is right to chide his political rivals for their
failure to tackle the issue of land ownership, but surely the SNP itself
needs to develop a more comprehensive policy than merely the blocking of
land purchases by would-be absentee owners (January 5).
There is no excuse for politicians, especially Scottish ones, not
having a clear-cut strategy for land reform. In the first part of this
century the slogan ''The Land for the People'' was coined by those
campaigning for a system of land-value taxation.
The movement began in Glasgow, spread rapidly throughout Britain, and
the reform was only prevented from being implemented through a desperate
rearguard action by the Lords.
With assessment based on optimum permitted use, and levied at 100p in
the pound, land-value taxation would neutralise the financial benefit of
merely owning land as rental income would always be matched by tax
liability.
Speculative land values would disappear and the false power base of
the large landowners would be destroyed without recourse to the
politically perilous step of compulsory redistribution of land parcels.
With no exemptions for underused or idle land, most efficient land-use
within existing planning constraints would be encouraged.
As an alternative rather than an additional source of revenue to the
Exchequer, the tax would provide the means to liberate the economy from
the debilitating burden of penal taxation on production such as income
tax and VAT.
There is no more effective way to gain control over communities than
to acquire the title to the land from under their feet, yet such titles
were originally created only through force or fraud.
It is axiomatic that as land values exist only by virtue of the
presence of the community at large, they should therefore be returned to
the community, yet outright ownership of land titles confers the
privilege of private appropriation of these values in perpetuity.
Until politicians acknowledge the unique role of land in the economy
and make land values the prime source of public revenue, all talk of
social justice will be empty rhetoric and any future Government will end
up going down just as many economic culs-de-sac as has the present one.

THE explosive growth in demand for wireless communications worldwide
is good news for Motorola, the international electronics company with
manufacturing sites in Scotland.
One of those sites -- South Queensferry -- will receive an investment
of #100m over three years, the company confirmed yesterday.
Wireless communications, such as cellular telephone, two-way radio and
paging, accounts for 60% of the group's product portfolio and enabled
the group yesterday to report strong earnings growth last year.
Semiconductors are also a strategic part of the group, accounting for
30% of its product portfolio, and provide the enabling technology for
Motorola's wireless communications business. Motorola is the
third-largest semiconductor manufacturer worldwide with what it believes
is the broadest product portfolio in the world.
The semiconductor business showed above average growth in sales last
year prompting the need for extra manufacturing capacity. It currently
has a strong base of six manufacturing facilities in the UK including a
cellular telephone plant at Easter Inch.
The company has been manufacturing semiconductors in East Kilbride for
25 years and has recently agreed to boost its presence with the
acquisition of Digital Equipment's South Queensferry plant. About 11% of
the group's semiconductors are currently produced in Scotland.
The acquisition is due to be finalised this summer, and once
completed, will put Motorola in the top 10 employers in Scotland,
providing jobs for more than 3000 people.
Excluding the South Queensferry purchase, more than #800m has been
spent or has been committed to the UK business since 1988. Following the
South Queensferry acquisition, $100m is to be invested in the business
between 1995 and 1997 with the creation of 100 new jobs.
Its state of the art semiconductors will supply European-based
customers and will also supply products for cellular subscriber
manufacturing at Easter Inch.
Motorola likes to be technologically innovative and has led the way in
developing wireless products. It launched the first in-car radio,
two-way radio walkie-talkie, and pager. It made its first investment in
cellular telephones 15 years ago although it is only now starting to pay
off.
Its latest venture to take it into the next century is the development
of satellite telephones. It has an international presence in terms of
both manufacturing facilities and customers and has also formed
significant global alliances with other high-tech companies including BT
and IBM.
New markets are opening up around the world. James Norling, President
of Motorola Europe, Middle East, and Africa estimates that half the
world's population have never made a phone call of any kind.
But it is not just in emerging markets that growth potential exists.
Cellular telephone penetration in the US, one of the world's most
advanced markets, is still only around 7%.
In many remote and underdeveloped countries it is quicker and more
cost effective to have wireless technologies rather than conventional
lines.
This enormous growth potential should ensure that the company easily
meets its forecast of two-thirds of its business taking place outside
its US base by 1997, which can only mean more good news for Motorola's
Scottish operations.

Opinion pollsters must be quaking in their boots following the news
that the estate agent Iain Robb has ''convincing data'' on support for
the M77 among his house-buying clients (January 14).
I am sure they will be mightily impressed by the technique of
excluding groups of people who might distort the desired answer. After
all, we wouldn't want the large majority of people in Corkerhill and
Pollok who don't own homes (or cars) to get in the way of local
businessmen who are ''more closely in touch with local feeling and
opinion'', would we?
During the 1988 public inquiry into the M77 opponents expressed
concern that the new road could create a honeypot for property
development in greenfield areas to the south-west of Glasgow. Some
cynics may now wonder whether estate agents are the best people to judge
''the greater good of the greater number''.

I protest against the anti-social influence of your crossword, the Wee

your clues and anagrams.
I also note that a Sgitheanach (a person from the Isle of Skye) is one

Verily the leopard does not change its spots. This reflection is
prompted by your report on the Ombudsman's scathing criticisms of the
operations of Strathclyde social work department.
The late Sir John Davidson, Scottish CBI director, expressed the view
that too much of Strathclyde's #170m social work budget went into
maintaining an elaborate bureaucracy.
In support of his contention I cited in your columns a well-documented
case concerning the apparently straightforward matter of a request for
an increase, to compensate for inflation, in the fees of a resident
placed by the department in a private home for the elderly.
Central region dealt with a parallel case in three days; Strathclyde
found it necessary to involve at least 14 of their staff at various
times over a period of nearly two years with completely negative
results.
Payments ceased altogether and the bureaucrats achieved new dimensions
of idiocy. They declared that no movement could take place until after
the completion of a form which was hitherto unheard-of and was
pronounced by Cosla to be quite inapplicable to private homes. They also
demanded masses of entirely irrelevant information about the detailed
finances of the home.
It was only when some very strong words were addressed to the the
(then) social work director (with copies to the chief executive of the
region and various conveners), and the matter was taken to the
Ombudsman, that the department was kick-started into some kind of
positive action.
It is surely time that a sweeping high-level investigation was
launched (by the Scottish Office?) into the whole administrative
structure of Strathclyde social work department.
Will no-one rid us of this monstrous bureaucracy?

David Belcher explains why Paisley Road Toll rings a bell with Kathy
Mattea.
YON cheeky Americans. They are alleging that there is another Grand
Ole Opry across the Atlantic in Tennessee -- quite apart from our own
original Grand Ole Opry, the famed Glaswegian shrine to country music
which is housed within a former corporation bus drivers' social club
amid the downhome griminess of Paisley Road Toll.
In Nashville it is, apparently, this second Grand Ole Opry. Country
stalwart Kathy Mattea, a Nashville resident of longstanding, knows both
venues. Indeed, the last time she was in Glasgow, Kathy drove past our
Grand Ole Opry. ''It was kinda surreal seeing the name,'' she says in
awed tones.
Neither does she find anything wholly unlikely about my conviction
that country music was invented in Scotland. ''Traditional Celtic music
is rural folk music, just like country in the US, and it plainly came
over to the US with Scottish settlers. It's about real people's lives,
and people sitting around singing and playing together, and the
instruments are much the same.
''In fact, when Dougie MacLean came over to the States and supported
me on a month's tour, my fiddler knew all these tunes that Dougie knew,
but with slight variations. It's like different branches of the same
tree.''
Kathy Mattea is a keen observer of transatlantic similarities. For
while tomorrow night she makes her performing debut in Scotland -- as
part of Celtic Connections at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall -- Kathy and
her songwriter husband, Jon Vezner, have been frequent visitors to our
shores over the past five years thanks to their friendship with the
aforementioned Caledonian chanter, Dougie MacLean.
''I see a lot of the same things about the place I was born and grew
up in, West Virginia, and where Dougie lives, Dunkeld. There's the same
terrain, mountain foothills. The same predominant economics, in that
neither place is exactly thriving, and people don't have a lot of
wealth. There's the same kind of close family set-up. And the same
food.''
Jings! You grew up with black pudding suppers in Charleston, West
Virginia?
''Pork products.''
Polite porkies were not on the menu of advice which Kathy received
when she moved to Nashville to begin her country career, having quit
West Virginia University unable to decide between social work and civil
engineering. ''I was good at number-crunching, but I like dealing with
people and didn't want to end up a brain in a jar some place.
''Anyway, when I first began taking songs round Nashville, everyone
said the same thing: 'Yeah, your voice is a great instrument and you're
making a beautiful noise -- but you need to learn to sing . . . it's not
the words, it's the emotions.' ''
Kathy's learning process encompassed waitressing; recording demos for
Nashville's many songwriters; and doing the odd radio ad. ''My voice
wasn't really high and perky enough, but I did a jingle for a local ice
cream store, and one for a local carpeting store they're still running,
10 years later.''
Her first big touring opportunity was as a backing singer with Bobby
Goldsboro. ''We went to Vegas, Atlantic City. I was so green, straight
out of the hills. I'd be phoning my parents to describe my hotel room
and tell them: 'Wow, we have a lady who presses all our clothes before
we go on stage'.''
As befits someone with a string of US chart-topping singles to her
name, Kathy Mattea is a little more sophisticated these days. But music
still brings out the awe-struck fan in her nature, Dougie MacLean's in
particular.
''Another musician gave me Dougie's first LP, and I never thought I'd
see him live. But then he played in Nashville and we wormed our way
backstage and found we had so much in common. The same music; the same
values; the same approach.
''I've visited Scotland five times now. I think I know enough to say:
'Hey, that's a Glasgow accent.' And to know that if I can't understand a
word, it's probably someone from Dundee.''
Yer darn tooten . . . gaun yirsel, hen, as some genuine country-lovers
from the one true Grand Ole Opry might be heard exclaiming tomorrow
night at the concert hall.

WILLIAM Walton's romantic but conservative grand opera Troilus and
Cressida received a lukewarm reaction at its premiere in 1954,
sandwiched uncomfortably between Benjamin Britten's astonishingly modern
Peter Grimes and Michael Tippett's mystifying The Midsummer Marriage.
It hasn't been seen in Britain for nearly 20 years. Could Matthew
Warchus, the latest star in the directorial firmament, transform what
was dismissed by one critic as ''a hopeless old dodo'', with his new
production for Opera North? Despite the work's flaws -- Christopher
Hassall's feeble libretto based on Chaucer's version of the Trojan
lovers, Walton's reliance on tried-and-tested orchestral devices, a lack
of any real sense of dramatic involvement, and too many awkward vocal
lines -- there are still many magic moments in the music.
Walton makes too many references to his other works but by the final
act where Cressida is forced to choose between her old Trojan lover
Troilus and her new politically expedient fiance, the Greek prince
Diomede, the tension is palpable.
Neil Warmington's set places us somewhere imprecise between ancient
and modern -- all temples and searchlights, knightly armour and
knickers. Richard Hickox conducts with huge authority and Judith Howarth
makes a brave attempt at Cressida, the part restored to its upper
register for dramatic soprano. A somewhat mature Arthur Davies looks
particularly uncomfortable as Troilus in the climactic but ultimately
unsatisfactory love scene.
Nigel Robson, in excellent voice, brings character and wit to the
pivotal character of Pandarus but Clive Bayley's Calkas, the defecting
High Priest, never really gets going.

Yet again we see another bank returning extremely good figures
considering the present economic climate (January 10).
Over the past few years I am sure that others, like myself, have
become more aware of the charges that banks impose on us for
''services'' rendered.
One thing that puzzles me about the system is that in this day and age
of hi-tech communications it takes two to three days for pay-ins to be
credited to accounts.

Is it cheaper to drive from the west of Scotland to the east or from
the east of Scotland to the west? It depends where you fill your fuel
tank.
On a visit to Edinburgh I purchased 35 litres of diesel at a service
station and was charged #16.77. On returning later that day I purchased
a further 35 litres of fuel at the same company's service station in
Coatbridge and was charged #19.57, an astonishing 16[1/2]% more, the
equivalent of paying VAT twice.
To fill my vehicle's 100-litre tank costs exactly #8 more in
Coatbridge than it does in Edinburgh. As I fill this tank some 80 times
per year, this amounts to a staggering annual surcharge of #640. Why are
drivers and companies in the west having to pay this ''double-VAT''
surcharge?

<TEXT>
A DECISION not to introduce the first screening test for hepatitis C
when it became available in 1989 was defended yesterday by the Scottish
National Blood Transfusion Service.
It said it was not accurate enough and would have led to a waste of
blood donations and caused needless anxiety to donors wrongly diagnosed
as having the infection.
More than 3000 people in the UK, 300 in Scotland, are estimated to
have been infected with the liver disease before a more accurate test
became available in 1991.
The BBC Panorama programme said last night the first test was widely
used in other countries but not in the UK, but a spokesman for the
Scottish service said last night: ''These were countries with a higher
level of hepatitis C in the population and the balance of benefit may
have been more in favour of testing.
''Because the original test was not very accurate, throwing up a high
proportion of both false positive and false negative results, the expert
advice we were given in this country was that it would be better to wait
for a more accurate test.''
He said that during this time research was going on for a better test,
which came into use in 1991, and ''in the meantime we screened out as
many potential carriers as we could by asking donors to exclude
themselves if they were at risk''.
Using the new test, the transfusion services are checking previous
donations from donors found to be positive in order to identify
recipients who have been infected. The impetus for this has been the
introduction of interferon as a treatment for hepatitis C.

Tam Dalyell is on his high horse again over his West Lothian question
(January 9). While I admire the man for his indomitable tenacity, by no
means solely on this subject, his great WLQ is an irrelevance.
The setting up of a separate parliament for Scotland would ipso facto
mean the end of the Union Parliament as at present constituted -- and
not before time.
Mr Dalyell displays arrogance of Westminster proportions in supposing
he might have the opportunity to debate or vote on purely English
matters; the electorate in England would never thole that.
But then, why not? After all this is precisely what Scotland has had
to put up with for close on 300 years. If Mr Dalyell considers such a
situation intolerable for England, why does he believe his fellow-Scots
should go on accepting it? He can't have it both ways.
England would insist, rightly, on its own independent parliament with
some kind of UK-wide assembly acting in appropriate areas, at least
until we take full independence.

JUNIOR doctors are overworked and underpaid by most Scottish hospitals
but a culture of fear within the profession keeps most of them
compliant, the head of a British Medical Association committee told an
industrial tribunal in Glasgow yesterday.
Dr Peter Bennie, chair of the committee of Scottish junior doctors,
was giving evidence on the first day of a test case hearing into claims
by 12 young doctors backed by the BMA.
They say they were wrongly classified in their contracts by their then
employer, the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and are owed
potentially thousands of pounds in unpaid overtime.
Should their complaints be upheld, NHS trusts across Scotland could
face similar actions costing perhaps millions.
The tribunal agreed to hear the cases of four, Dr Bruce Elliot, Dr
Rory Melville, Dr Claire Murray, and Dr Valerie Dudgeon over the four
days set aside this week. The remaining eight cases will be held over.
Dr Bennie told the tribunal that junior doctors who completed two
six-month attachments -- one surgical, one medical -- before progressing
to the grade of senior house officer, frequently received their
contracts of employment setting down their formal terms and conditions
three to four months after starting work.
These arrangements, he said, often bore little resemblance to the work
actually undertaken. There existed powerful pressures on doctors in
their first professional positions to accept the situation and keep
quiet.
''Most junior doctors are quite wary of taking any action about their
terms and conditions, usually for fear that they may be identified as
troublemakers and their career prospects damaged as a result,'' said Dr
Bennie, a senior registrar in psychiatry.
Public concern and a widespread professional acknowledgment of the
potential dangers of working junior doctors too hard had led to the
agreement in 1992 of a new deal limiting their hours of service.
Under this deal, an upper limit was set on mandatory overtime above a
40-hour week of between 16 hours if a full shift was worked and 32 hours
if on call, with a third category of a partial shift created, set at 24
additional hours.
The agreement also set the proviso that doctors on call should be
resting for a substantial period of the duty. ''If a doctor is worked
intensely for 72 hours instead of 56 it is clearly outwith the terms of
agreement,'' said Dr Bennie.
Pay rates were also laid down whereby doctors received 50% of their
basic hourly wage for hours spent on call, 70% of basic for every hour
worked on a partial shift, and the full basic rate paid for every hour
on a full shift.
''A hospital will do its utmost to classify a job as an on call rota
position wherever possible,'' Dr Bennie said. ''That means they can work
junior doctors for the full 72 hours and only have to pay them the 50%
overtime rate.''
They were consequently often used as a source of cheap labour, doing
tasks that could be completed by other hospital employees.
He told the tribunal: ''Some are used for clerical tasks because at
only 50% overtime they're cheaper than employing somebody to do the job.
The junior doctors are not in a position usually to be brave enough to
complain.''
The complaints of the 12 doctors involve a six-month period from
August 1993 to the end of January last year, when they were first
employed at the Royal Alexandra.
The group, now mostly senior house officers employed elsewhere,
exhausted the NHS trust's internal grievance procedure before bringing
their case to the industrial tribunal, which continues today.

THIS is weird. Mary Coughlan and me together in a hotel room late in
the evening. OK, it's the ballroom and it's mobbed. Maybe 400 others.
Still it's weird.
She's a bonny lass in her own wicked way. She sings like a fallen
angel, at once sweet, perhaps even convent pure, and yet richly dark and
sensual. She performs in mood swings. Breathless, panting at times, she
moves through the emotions. ''From the humorous to the heart-breaking --
that's life,'' she says. With every subtle change you feel the passion
slide sharply like a switchblade down the spine.
She seduces her audience shamelessly with songs about the downside of
love. About the victims of romance. Here is a lady who has lived a full
life.
Her accompaniment is sparse -- no rhythm section -- so it is a
laid-back Mary Coughlan. An acoustic set. Unplugged but still
electrifying. She opens with her oldest companions -- The Laziest Girl,
Blue Surrender, and Double Cross. This was her tired and emotional
phase, her stories of early sexual experience. She moves later to Meet
Me Where They Play the Blues and Red Ribbon, a song which ''pretends to
be happy but like all the others it is not''.
The songs are short; the bits in between are even shorter. Mary
Coughlan is pure jazz. The folk connection must now be regarded as
tenuous.
But she can move an audience like no-one else. She delivers love bites
of reality in an unashamedly Irish brogue.

FOR those women, and no doubt the occasional man, who find Newsnight
presenter Jeremy Paxman an object of desire, I can give them a batsqueak
of pleasure by telling them how I bumped into Jeremy yesterday while he
was wearing rubberised trousers up to his armpits. Not in one of those
seedy London clubs, I must add, but in the more wholesome pursuit of
wading into the river Tay at the Kenmore Hotel for the start of the Tay
salmon fishing season.
The poor lad thought that all he had to do was drive up to the hotel,
have an early night, then stroll along to the river bank. But it's not
that simple. First he had to sit through the informal ceilidh in the
hotel bar on Sunday night -- three separate renditions of Flower of
Scotland left him particularly bemused -- and then in the morning there
was a march to the river behind a piper and an early morning dram in the
Boar's Head.
I thought it was called the Boar's Head because of all the stories
that anglers' tell, but Mark Wilton-Steer of the hotel claims that the
stuffed boar's head above the bar is a genuine Scottish boar. He even
claimed that Taymouth Castle next door used to have a herd of buffalo,
but that really sounds like a tall tale.
Anyway I'm told that Mr Paxman caught an old kelt, which he had to put
back in the river. No, it doesn't mean he was seen pushing Billy McNeil
into the Tay. Kelts are salmon that have already spawned. You may like
to know that the best way of spotting if the salmon you've caught is
fresh from the sea is if it still has sea lice on it. Very tasty.
Dog-eared
ONE keen angler who failed to make the opening day yesterday was Scots
rugby internationalist John Jeffrey. Perhaps he was still embarrassed
from his attempts last year when he managed to hook the ear of a passing
gundog. No, don't worry, the springer spaniel was OK. Have you seen the
ears on these dogs? As JJ is known as the White Shark, Jim, the
spaniel's owner, wondered if this was the only known example of a shark
catching a spaniel.
Scales of injustice
WORST joke of the day was the angler who remarked that it was so
difficult to find the fish that they should be renamed Salmon Rushdie.
One that got away
PHOTOGRAPHERS from the tabloid press are often the most resourceful
people around. Thus when Willie Thornton of the Daily Record was told
yesterday that not one salmon had been landed on the Tay he simply
shrugged his shoulders, reached into his bag, and pulled out a blow-up
salmon which he inflated to its full three-foot length.
A quick scout around found a suitably photogenic wean to stand beside
it, and hey presto, the picture is taken, without even getting his feet
wet. Only snag was that the three-year-old girl cried when he tried to
take Wanda -- yes, that was the obvious name he gave his fish -- back.
Kind-hearted Willie let her keep it. But like any photographer, he'll
probably sue for suggesting he's kind-hearted.
Nae Luck awards
THE Scotsman's coverage of Sir Alexander Gibson's death will have left
a sour note among music lovers. Despite stating there was ''no-one like
him'' the paper managed to use a picture on its front page yesterday,
not of Sir Alex, but of Glasgow lawyer Malcolm McIver, a senior partner
in Bird Semple. And no, Mr McIver is not like him at all.
Just as unlucky is the February edition of the glossy mag Loaded. It
profiles comedian Peter Cook in its series of ''Greatest Living
Englishmen''.
And just to show how even-handed we are at The Herald, a few readers
noticed the line in our obituary of Larry Grayson which referred to his
old friend actress Noele Gordon. It stated: ''She was devastated when
she died.'' Well, she would have been, wouldn't she? Although reader
Isabel Inglis went a bit far when she claimed she found that paragraph
funnier than she ever found Larry Grayson.
It's a hard game
CONFIRMATION that they breed them tough in Ayrshire. The Allan Glens
versus Cumnock second 15 rugby game was cancelled on Saturday when a
Cumnock prop left the field with a broken nose. Not so unusual you might
think. The thing is, it happened when he was still warming up with his
team-mates.
If that's what they do to each other, you may think that the Glens
chappies got off lightly. But rather than send condolences and flowers
to the Cumnock player, Glens are writing to the league committee
claiming the three points. ''We were ready. We had full subs. They
shouldn't have turned up without them,'' said the warm and caring human
being Bill McIntosh, Glens vice president.
Old ones are best
READER Jean Macluskie says that Tom Shields's telling of the joke last
week about ''Is that your Ayrshire bacon'' confirms there is no such
thing as a new joke. She says it takes her back almost 60 years to when
it was used by the late Sammy Murray at the Queens Theatre. She says it
was considered very risque at the time. Perhaps that's why Tom thought
he'd better wait so long before using it.
Old jokes also travel well apparently. When some British Airways staff
from Scotland were in Boston last week, the trolley-bus tour driver
Corin told them that his great-grandfather Jamie from Edinborow (sic)
was the cheapest Scot alive. On one occasion a relative came round to
find him stripping the wallpaper. Asked if he was decorating Jamie
replied ''No. I'm moving.''

DEVISING imaginative programmes of contemporary music has become a
speciality of the Chamber Group of Scotland, and last night's was no
exception. A clever interweaving of Dutch humour and Italian lyricism
formed its framework, within which was placed the premiere of an
atmospheric new Scottish work, Magnus Robb's Ancient Language of Birds
articulated with razor-sharp precision by Linda Hirst.
The music, a species of vocalise, was rooted in predatory bird-song --
voiced, whistled, and chirped with appropriate menace -- upon which a
violin, cello, clarinet, harp, and piano provided a similarly ominous
commentary.
The result was a wordless scena, explicit and arresting in its
intensity. If the 25-year-old composer proves able to employ words with
equal vividness, he will be someone to reckon with. Scottish Opera watch
out.
What Luciano Berio can do with words is already internationally
established, and the three James Joyce settings that form his Chamber
Music formed another fine vehicle for Linda Hirst's talents. The imagery
of wind and water was beautifully conveyed, and again she received
adroit support from members of the ensemble who, in other permutations,
brought disruptive zest to Louis Andriessen's Disco, a sort of
Copland-style country-dance gone haywire, and a gradually burgeoning
beauty to Dallapiccola's Due Studi for violin and piano.
These were played to admiration by Ruth Crouch and Graeme McNaught,
but in three Dallapiccola cello pieces -- music of resonant
expressiveness -- Robert Irvine proved no less impressive.

THE Irish trio managed to arrive in Glasgow without any tapes or CDs
to sell to their converts after their support slot to Kathryn Tickell,
which was a shame because their free-form Caribbean-Celtic arrangements
were a joy.
From the frantic opener Sheebeg Sheemor (more usually played as a slow
air) to a joyous rendition of The Long Note, complete with lilting Afro
bass lines and extensive ornamentation on the whistle, this was
exhilarating stuff. Interested parties, and there were many, can buy the
album from Alan Connaughton, c/o Starc Studios, 6 Darthmouth Place,
Dublin 4, Eire.
Northumbria's Kathryn Tickell (and her band, featuring a one-off
line-up of guitar, bass, Northumbrian pipes, fiddle, and marimba) also
took all sorts of chances with the music.
Intentions were clear early doors when they effortlessly broke out of
a tidy but rather pedestrian accompaniment to the traditional Otterburn,
and swung into a distinctly jazzy take of Tickell's Halibut.
St Kilda Wedding was treated in much the same upbeat way, with guitar
and pipes trading licks round the melody.
But for straight-ahead weirdness the night had nothing to match
Brundeanlaws, a tune ''based on the theft of a Lada''. This had the
pipes accompanied by guitar, bass, and a longbow struck with a stick by
the percussionist, who occasionally also managed to smack a variety of
small pots he balanced on his chest.
Gobsmacked as many were by the bow and the pots, the overall effect
was an entrancing rhythmic backdrop to the sweet tones of the small
pipes, and Brundeanlaws drew hearty applause.
A great performance by both bands, with the music bursting out of
''traditional'' straitjackets all over the place.

THE Government's railway privatisation programme has been dubbed the
poll tax on wheels. Up to a point it is a good analogy, but when you get
to thinking about the consequences of the programme we are about to be
embarked on, it looks an awful lot scarier than that.
Yes, the poll tax was crazy. It didn't work and it had to be scrapped.
It cost a small fortune to untangle the muddle and a lot of vulnerable
people were made to suffer, but not much permanent damage was done.
The plan to privatise the railways, on the other hand, threatens to
inflict dreadful, lasting damage on whole swathes of the country -- the
Highlands, Central Scotland, indeed everywhere, from Thurso to Penzance.
When the Highland lines were last under threat I was moved to embark
on the publication of a series of guides, postcards, posters and tapes
publicising some of their breathtaking features. Over the years they
have sold rather well and I like to think they could have encouraged one
or two travellers to foray into the area to see the wonders for
themselves.
So I have been watching the plans for the West Highland Line with a
special interest. What I have seen has filled me with increasing horror.
The through sleeper service is to go, as is the car-carrying Motorail
service. The steam train to Mallaig, a superb tourist draw since the
mid-eighties, looks decidedly wobbly. An undertaking known as Waterman
Railways, which had been awarded the contract to run it, appears to have
had second thoughts and has backed out.
Even the once-daily ''real'' train -- a proper locomotive and coaches
capable of carrying back-packers and their bicycles into the Highlands
-- appears to have been axed from both the West Highland and the
northern lines for the coming summer season.
Just a year after celebrating its centenary, the West Highland Line is
beginning to look horribly like a candidate for closure. And things seem
little better elsewhere. ScotRail's director Chris Green, probably the
finest rail boss in the country, has chillingly warned that the cuts
brought on by the pre-privatisation squeeze would need to be ''more
savage than anticipated'' just to allow services to survive.
And all this, claims Dr Mawhinney, is being done in the name of
improvement.
So STORM! (STOp this Railway Madness!) has been born. The inaugural
public protest meeting, to be addressed by MPs Charles Kennedy and Brian
Wilson among others, is scheduled for this Friday evening in Fort
William, with gatherings in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Ayr the following
weekend and further meetings throughout the country.
Driving the railway through the hills to Fort William and beyond
involved a monumental struggle. It should not be given up without an
equally spirited fight.
Given the barmy structure promised for rail privatisation, no part of
Scotland's railway system can be considered safe. Is Railtrack to be
believed when it promises that the rust spreading over the structure of
the magnificent Forth Rail Bridge is of a harmless sort? (The right sort
of rust?)
If trains need to run from Edinburgh to Dundee might Railtrack not
find it far more attractive to route them through Stirling and Perth,
thus eliminating, at a stroke, the burden of maintaining two extremely
costly river crossings? (''Close inspection reveals that the structures
have become unsafe for passenger traffic,'' a relieved Railtrack
spokesman announced towards the end of 1996.)
In happier times east coast interests were pressing, through the
CREATE campaign, for electrification to continue from Edinburgh right
through to Aberdeen. Anywhere else in Europe this sort of development
would be considered long overdue. But Aberdeen, the source of billions
of pounds used to prop up the British economy over the past two decades,
will need to fight to retain any sort of respectable service at all.
And what of the stations? The impending sale of Railtrack and its
assets could put into play some of the most valuable real estate in
Scotland. What am I bid for Glasgow Central or Edinburgh Waverley? Not
for sale at the moment? Well, maybe not, but as the search for money to
extract from the system to hand to the Treasury becomes more frenzied
who can say what might not be put up for auction. Remember what fortunes
were made when the bus companies were sold off at bargain prices,
complete with their city-centre sites.
The planned rail privatisation is vandalism on an extraordinary scale
and the effects it could have on Scotland would be simply devastating.
While the rest of Europe moves towards integrated transport systems
boasting 200-mile-an-hour high-speed rail links, Britain is set to lurch
towards transport oblivion.
Scotland faces a toy-town future with a handful of Sprinter train sets
and rusting monuments to a far finer and braver age.
It is still not too late to call a halt to this madness. Powerful
popular protest can change even this blinkered Government's thinking.
Anyone who cares about the future of public transport in Scotland and
indeed in the country as a whole should make their voice heard. Keep
close tabs on the activities of Railtrack; pester your MP; contact
ministers direct; look out for public meetings and demonstrations; sign
the STORM! petition.
Names such as Arisaig, Attadale, Corrour, Forsinard, Georgemas, Kyle
of Lochalsh, Plockton and Tulloch must not be allowed to disappear from
the railway map of Scotland -- not, at any rate, without a monumental
battle to save them.

<HEADLINE>Loss of manpower could hit hospital waiting lists. Doctors threaten industrial action on pay bargaining</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ALAN MACDERMID, MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>980320455</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DOCTORS' leaders yesterday announced that industrial action is being
considered if the Government seeks to enforce local pay bargaining in UK
hospitals.
Dr Brian Potter, the newly-installed Scottish secretary of the British
Medical Association, said that patient treatment would not be directly
affected by the proposals.
They could mean hospital consultants refusing to work beyond their
contracted hours, refusing to carry out administrative work,
particularly tasks necessitated by the NHS reforms, and seeing patients
purely on medical grounds and not for their trust's commercial reasons.
According to Dr Potter and BMA Scottish chairman Dr John Callender,
this would mean only one waiting list with no special arrangements for
fund-holding GPs who had negotiated better terms.
A consultant in Scotland is obliged to work 38 hours, but Dr Potter
said: ''It is reckoned that the average consultant gives 14 hours extra
over and above their contractual duties.''
The loss of this extra manpower is bound to have a major effect on
hospitals and their waiting lists.
However, Dr Potter added: ''I don't think any doctor would put his
patients at risk, but a lot of the work that consultants and GPs do is
administrative and is connected with the reforms. I think that work
could be at risk. But nothing that affected patients would be
jeopardised.''
Dr Callander admitted: ''It could be that certain categories of work
could affect patients in the long run . . . if a court asked for a
report that might not come through as quickly. But there would be no
problem about people receiving treatment.''
The BMA is squaring up to resist local pay bargaining because it
claims that some parts of the country will be placed at a disadvantage
if hospitals in other areas are able to pay more attractive salaries. It
could also lead to some specialties attracting higher salary levels than
''Cinderella'' specialties.
The Government has pressed the independent Doctors and Dentists Review
Body, which sets salary levels for the two professions, to set a minimal
increase this year and leave the rest to be negotiated at local level.
Their report is expected early next month. The Government would then
have to table an order in Parliament to give effect to local pay
bargaining.
For Dr Potter, 42, a former GP and BMA activist, it means a baptism of
fire in his new post after three years as a civil servant in the
Scottish Office Home and Health Department.
''This could well be the last straw for people who are already
completely fed up,'' he said. ''The dangers from local pay are
incalculable.
''There is now a national service with each consultant paid the same
package of remuneration. If local pay is brought in, surgeons may be
paid differently from psychiatrists and it would be difficult to attract
staff to some parts of the country.
''We don't want to get into battle-talk but it appears the anger of
many doctors is considerable. We hope the Government will continue to
listen and act according to what it hears.''
Dr Potter said he had returned to the profession to find a very low
level of morale in both GPs and hospital doctors. He added: ''I think I
prefer to be on this side of the table, but it is interesting to see how
Government works.''
His priorities would be to reflect what doctors in Scotland are
feeling and in particular their view about the reforms, and to reflect
their general unhappiness and anger, especially about local pay
negotiations which are being driven from down South.
''Doctors are really fed up. Relatively young people are saying they
would get out if they could. I think a lot of it is down to the NHS
reforms and management -- many of them people who have got into the NHS
without any knowledge of it -- dictating what happens without due
consultation.
''It affects the nurses too with low numbers on the wards, not enough
time to speak to patients. Doctors have no time to speak to patients
either; it is a difficult job, you are dealing with people in distress.
Sick patients have anxieties and they need time to settle down to tell
you what the problem is. You can't do it if you are shuttling them
through like tins of beans.''
He admitted, though, that the last thing the NHS needed now was more
convulsive change. They had to look carefully at -- in the words of BMA
national chairman Sandy Macara -- reforming the reforms.

The female yob has arrived. Stephen McGinty examines the increase in
violence among women and how aggression is being marketed in our society
MUD-WRESTLING, foxy-boxing, cat-fights. Fighting women have always
ignited a certain voyeuristic glee in the minds of men who associate a
punch with a little slap and tickle. But that bout is over. The sexual
image of violent women collapsed with Francis O'Neill outside a
Drumchapel bar. The final whistle was blown with the recent conviction
of Carol Campbell and Elizabeth Graham for assault.
The two 25-year-old women were refused a drink and so ambushed O'Neill
once he had left the bar. Carol Campbell smashed a bottle into his face,
then used a Stanley knife to slash him, while Elizabeth Graham kicked
and punched his face and body before stamping on his face. The attack
ended when Graham, who served five years for killing another man,
dragged Campbell off. Graham was sentenced to one year, Campbell to
four. A detective described the pair as ''girls from hell''.
The attack in London on actress Elizabeth Hurley by a gang of girls
focused the nation's attention on violent women. John Major announced a
crackdown on yob culture just as yob woman was arriving, as if imported
from America and the harsh reality of violent girl gangs. There were
press reports of an incident in London involving three teenage girls,
who reportedly beat, stripped and offered their 14-year-old victim to a
group of teenage boys to rape.
Home Office statistics say crimes of violence by women have increased
by 73% between 1982 and 1992. However, the reality of violent crime by
Scottish women remains difficult to gauge as the Scottish Office does
not distinguish between the sexes. But the Home Office figure must be
put in perspective. Last year there were 5337 non-sexual crimes of
violence in Scotland. A look at the average daily prison population
shows how few would be committed by women. In 1993 the figure was 5637,
and only 171 inmates were women.
Sociologists and criminologists have two explanations for why women
seldom become violent. It is either inherent in their nature to be
non-violent or it is a result of socialisation and their treatment for
thousands of years. If it is socialisation then an increase would be
expected as their roles continue to develop.
Denise Mina is preparing her PhD at Glasgow University on the
ascription of mental illness to female offenders. ''When women are
violent,'' she says, ''the legal and social reaction is overwhelmingly
negative and stigmatised. It becomes so much stronger a social
imperative for them not to be as violent as men. If a women is violent
her sexual orientation is immediately suspect. Or they think she is mad.
Look at the outrage over the film Dirty Weekend. The media and the
country just can't handle the idea of women being aggressive.''
However, society's perceptions will have to change. Currently there
are only two types of women who can become violent. One is the abused
wife who retaliates, the other, a tough-ticket scheme girl, branded a
''growler'' or ''wee hairy'' by the public. But many people believe that
as women become increasingly independent and forceful, so will the
number of violent incidents involving a female protagonist.
Denise Mina agrees with this view but points out that it is an upsurge
from a very small base-line which creates an artificial picture. The
cause, she believes, is drugs, and the violence will often take place in
a deeper sub-culture and go unreported. Last year documentary film-maker
Liz Ingram produced Possil Girls -- We Are Here, for Channel 4, a
portrait of four girls and their world of shoplifting and violent
scuffles.
''What we found were rough girls who were quite happy to wade in,''
she said. ''There exist girls who don't mind fighting and there are
other girls for whom a fight would be the most awful shock. It would
devastate them. The others can fight their friends and then forget it.
They can do it for a buzz.''
The two girls who attacked 21-year-old students Anne and Pam in
Glasgow's West End screamed ''F**kin' bitches'' and then the onslaught
began. It was just before Christmas and outside a friend's flat when the
students, who are still so shaken by the incident that they want to
remain anonymous, were grabbed by the 14-year-old girls, encouraged by a
gang of guys. Anne was dragged to the kerb, and behind a car, punched
and kicked on her head, face and body. Her friend was shoved out of the
way. ''I could just hear her scream and scream.''
Pam was pushed almost to her house, her hair pulled out, and then she
was dragged to the ground. ''She was sitting on me, bashing my head off
the pavement.'' Another friend who saw the attack was warned away by the
boys and fled to phone the police. Although both girls had money, it
remained untouched. ''They just wanted to beat us up . . . friends ask
what kind of guy could have done that and we have to say: 'No, it was
girls'.''
Sold on violence
* AGGRESSIVE women have found a place in today's pop culture. On
Rimmel's television advert a skinheaded girl dressed in army vest and
dog-tags declares: ''It's not make-up, it's ammunition.'' One brand of
sports shoe used the ad-line: ''You can't wear shoes like Cindy, when
you train like Tyson'' -- a dubious reference to a convicted rapist.
However, both adverts and activities such as boxercise promote a tough,
determined woman.
Yvonne Tasker is an academic and author of Spectacular Bodies which
looks at gender in today's action movies. ''Advertising especially is
targeting aggression and determination. Look at the car advert which
rips off Thelma and Louise. They don't die but it does tap into a sense
of aggression and women's changed role. It's different with fashion --
it keeps trying to introduce a more feminine style but it's not working,
not with teenagers, not for the wee girls in big boots.''
Though the notion of girl gangs remains a sexy media subject, all
sneers and mini-skirts, in reality they appear not to exist. Not as
named organisations in the sense of territories and graffiti. In his
history of Glasgow's street gangs, Tongs Ya Bas, R G MacCallum
chronicles the distant days of the 1940s and he claims that girl gangs
such as the She Tongs, Young She Cumbie and Young She Tongs still exist,
but according to Strathclyde police, female gang membership only extends
as far as a few hangers-on among the Queen Street Posse, a minor street
gang involved in shoplifting sprees.

GLASGOW and Edinburgh Airports both handled record numbers of
passengers last year, according to figures published yesterday.
The number using Glasgow Airport was 5.4 million, an increase of 8.8%
on the previous year, and Edinburgh notched up three million, a rise of
10.3%.
In all, BAA's seven airports handled 86.8 million passengers, an
increase of 7.4% on 1993. Only Aberdeen lagged behind, down 5.5% at 2.1
million.
More than 51 million people passed through Heathrow, a rise of 7.9%,
making last year its busiest year ever. More than 21 million used
Gatwick, an increase of 4.9% but just below the airport's record
achieved in 1989.
The figures also showed that BAA airports handled 6.1 million
passengers last month -- 8.2% up on the same month the previous year,
and boosted by a 13% growth in traffic to and from the Irish Republic.
Last month also saw an 11% rise in holiday flight passengers, a 9%
increase in European scheduled traffic, and 7% rise in North Atlantic
passengers.
The Glasgow figures were published days after Air France announced it
was dropping its Glasgow-Paris daily service, and Lufthansa said it was
withdrawing direct weekday flights to Frankfurt.

KEIL School at Dumbarton is celebrating 1995 with the 80th anniversary
of its foundation, a record number of pupils, and the opening of a new
custom-built art and design department, a traditionally strong area
within the school.
Founded in 1915 by Sir William Mackinnon as the Kintyre Technical
School, at Keil House, Southend, Argyll, the building was destroyed by
fire a decade later. Having moved in 1925 to the 50 acre estate
overlooking the River Clyde at Helenslee, Dumbarton, where it has
remained, it took the name Keil School.
Over the years, Keil has grown steadily. Today, its pupil roll stands
at 210, just over half of whom are day pupils. 1989 saw the school
become fully co-educational. Girls, who have their own house, now
account for one third of its total.
Keil's headmaster, John Cummings, took the helm in April 1993, having
taught previously at Wycliffe College, Gloucestershire, Tonbridge
School, Kent, and latterly at Glasgow Academy.
In attempting to explain the ethos of Keil, Mr Cummings says: ''We
firmly believe in the best of the Scottish tradition of education. We
consider that we have a very good curriculum in place, along with a very
caring atmosphere; this makes the individual pupil the most important
element of the school, in what we hope is a strong, family atmosphere.
''The pastoral system at Keil,'' continues the headmaster, ''is a
strength not only for the boarders, but also for the day pupils. The
fact that our central ethos is as a boarding school, means that the day
pupils benefit from a very active, invigorating, stimulating programme,
not only in the classroom but outside it. That is our great strength.''
In any one term, Mr Cummings explains, the school offers, in addition
to their main sports -- rugby, hockey, athletics, cricket, tennis,
netball, basketball, football -- some 20 different activities, from the
Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme to chess, sailing to choir, community
service to orienteering, drama, and debating.
''We look for good leadership potential. When it comes to
participation in plays or concert, debates or sport for example, we find
a large proportion of the school taking part,'' says John Cummings. ''It
is difficult to opt out at Keil; that's an important factor.''
Pupils enter Keil at transitus (primary seven) or at S1, and at other
levels depending on availability of places. Entry to the school is by
interview and test, and a report from the pupil's present school.
Following the entrance examination in February, a number of
scholarships, bursaries and Government assisted places are awarded;
while mainly based on academic ability, a pupil's likely contribution to
the life of the school in terms of a combination of strength of
personality and particular abilities in, for example, music, art, drama
and sports also may be taken into account. There are a number of special
Mackinnon-Macneill Foundation Awards for pupils from the Highlands and
Islands.
The new #125,000 art and design department opened last week, and
adjacent to other recently built blocks housing the sciences and maths,
was funded from capital. Mary Duncan, head of art at Keil, comments:
''We will be able to expand the number of our activities -- screen
printing for example, which hopefully will be in full swing by next year
-- which is absolutely essential. The extra space we now have to enable
us to do things properly, is the biggest bonus.''
Head of technical subjects, Martin Lennie explains: ''The two new
highers, graphic communication and the revised craft and design, are now
accepted at university as the fourth or fifth subject, because we've
moved away from 80% practical to 80% theory in the latter. The way we
undertake design within craft and design, parallels Strathclyde
University's teaching of first year students; that's tied in quite
nicely.
''Graphic communication involves pupils doing what's called a thematic
presentation: looking at how the product is marketed and following that
through. Keil offers both subjects from first year up to higher.
Summarising, John Cummings he says: ''Keil seeks pupils with the
potential to benefit from the all-round education that we offer, and the
positive aspects in the life of the school. If one wants a good measure
of a Keil pupil, it's the sort of citizen they become three or four
years after leaving school. That's the yardstick.''

LIKE a dinosaur emerging from the swamp, devolution has again reared
its head into the political daylight. Party leaders snarl over the
divide, back benchers sputter, and the simple souls of the English press
jam the switchboards to Scotland, raising elementary questions of
politics and policy that would try the patience of a 14-year-old. So
here we go again. There's only one difference from evolution. Devolution
takes longer.
The new debate is exasperating because it is so artificial. The good
souls of Scotland are no less bored with devolution now than they have
ever been. Even at the height of its previous spasms -- 1992, 1977, 1968
-- the Scots have had better things to worry about. No voter in his
right mind could consider the constitutional debate more pressing or
important than the gripping issues of life -- unemployment, low taxes,
stable prices, a reliable health service, secure national defence.
No-one seriously believes that 1995 will see the Jocks taking to the
streets for the greater glory of Canon Kenyon Wright.
No: this is not Lazarus, called from the dead, but Frankenstein's
monster, rewired in the laboratory by grey-suited spooks. John Major and
his colleagues have deliberately revived the home rule debate. The
reasons are plain to see. They desperately need some policy issue that
may divide Labour as much as Europe divides the Tories. It has to be a
policy stand sufficiently detailed to be readily ridiculed; it has to be
calculated to bore or repel the mass of the British electorate; it has
to be an issue that served the Tories well before.
Labour's home rule plans fit the bill perfectly. So it's on with the
electrodes and up with Frankenstein's monster. Into the Westminster
arena he lurches. He's big. He's ugly. He's lumbering. He's not so much
alive as undead. And already he's scaring the socks off people. For the
first time in many a month he has put the Labour Party on the defence.
Blair is getting ratty. The back benches are getting bolshie. The good
folk of the nation are yawning, and Salmond's smile grows wider by the
day.
It is all totally contrived and artificial. But there are serious
issues here. Why are scribblers across the nation so willing to dance to
the Prime Minister's music? This is not a burning issue of the day. This
is a spoiler cooked up by the Government's PR apparatchiks. The
Constitutional Convention bored itself to death a long time ago. Jim
Sillars has stalked off to make pots of money somewhere, and the last
stickers screeching Scotland Free by '93 perished with the echoes of the
Usher Hall debate. Yet we dance. Why?
One reason is naked self-interest. There's gold in them there Bills.
How many publishers' promises turned to dust in April 1992? How many of
the Scots literati saw their agreeable potboilers -- the musings of
McIlvanney, Massie, et al -- on the hopes of independence sag, die and
hit the remainder shelves? In March 1992 scarcely a Scots author,
journalist or pundit could be found who was not penning the definitive
book on the new Scotland. In my own case it never came off the Amstrad.
Many others were much more publicly humiliated.
Bear in mind, as this debate continues, that most of your windows on
the issue have a powerful vested interest. Scottish papers, Scottish
broadcasters, and Scottish politicians of every hue stand to benefit
professionally and economically from the return of the national question
and the putative revival of a Scottish Parliament.
There's another motive, however, and that is the mounting irritation
of the mediavolk with Tony Blair and the Labour machine. The arrogance
of Blair's entourage -- particularly his senior press adviser, Alastair
Campbell -- has ruffled feathers across the realm. Campbell and the
system demand, as of right, uncritical and supportive coverage of the
Once and Future King. Already journalists who think, and write,
otherwise are being bawled out. Campbell has even staged one or two
petty boycotts of unfavoured channels and papers.
In the meantime, Labour politicians insolently refuse to specify
important points of policy or to make plain their stand on fiscal and
social issues of genuine public concern. A point has now come where many
hacks simply refuse to put up with it. If Mr Blair will throw no meat,
we are only too delighted to flock outside and chew the ageing steak
flung forth by the Prime Minister.
So much for the devolution debate. What of the policy itself? Its
absurdities and contraditions have already been ably poked by my
colleagues. Its dynamic is wrong: the governance of Scotland should not
be determined by Labour's desire to dish the SNP. Its timescale is
incredible: a Scottish Parliament, legislated and served up within the
first year of a Labour government sounds suspiciously like instant whip.
Its contitutional logic is bizarre: a Nationalist like myself may look
on Tam Dalyell as the Demon King, but the West Lothian question must be
answered.
And then, of course, there is the ridiculous quota of women. By Labour
canon law 50% of Scottish Parliament members will be female. They have
yet to explain why on earth anyone should think this a Good Thing. Or
why women are so inadequate they cannot be allowed to compete on equal
electoral terms with men. Most sensible people might feel that if the
Scottish people chose to elect an overwhelmingly male Parliament, they
would be entitled to have it.
As Enoch Powell reminded us, many years ago, power devolved is power
retained. The Labour Party promises that the Mother of Parliaments will
graciously bestow on the Scottish people an assembly for Scottish
affairs. But the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament will stand.
The sovereignty of the Scottish people will remain discounted. And any
future British Parliament will retain the power to abolish a Scottish
legislature.
Let us examine this from a nationalist logic. Scottish nationalism is
not ethnic or racial, it is political. (That is why cheap comparisons
with the Balkans, or even with Nazism, are stupid as well as
disgusting.) Nationalists do not seek independence because the Scots are
the greatest people on earth. They seek an independent Scotland because
it is an entirely different country from England -- it has a different
landscape, culture, climate, economy and values. As long as the Union
abides, it will suffer repeatedly and constantly from a Westminster
Parliament that will -- and must -- go on supporting English interests.
The English, of course, have every right to have their interests. And
a Parliament composed largely of English MPs is entirely right to
promote those interests. But these interests are not our interests. And,
under Labour's home rule scheme, the conflict could only continue and
may well escalate.
Consider. Labour's Scottish Parliament will have no authority over any
matters of defence. But Scotland will still have more military bases
than any other part of the United Kingdom, and remain the prime target
of enemy missiles. Labour's Scottish Parliament will have no authority
to treat with the European Union. But Scottish waters hold most of the
UK fisheries -- and indeed, the largest single chunk of EU fishing area.
Labour's Scottish Parliament will have no control over national energy
policy. But Scotland's continental shelf holds most of the UK's oil.
We have yet to be persuaded that Labour's Scottish Parliament could
prove to be anything more than Cosla writ large. It will be a Parliament
without sovereignty, doomed to toe the Westminster line on almost every
issue of importance. This sort of limited home rule could only make
sense as part of a federal reconstruction of the UK. That would require
the imposition of regional assemblies on Wales and the English provinces
-- assemblies they do not appear to want. It would also entail dramatic
reduction of the authority of Westminster and, logically, a considerable
reduction in the number of MPs there.
The whole crazy scheme has one attraction. If Labour wins the next
election on this platform, and fails to create the promised Parliament,
the SNP will clobber them. If the Scottish Parliament is created, it
will rapidly create a true Scottish political class and a very public
Scottish forum. Conflict with Westminster must prove inevitable.
Independence may well follow.
John Major is right. There can be no halfway house between
independence and the Union. But the roles seem oddly reversed. It is the
English Conservatives who have most to gain from a Scottish secession.
And it is the Labour Party, by its own internal logic, and its
increasing obsession with Westminster power, which should now repudiate
all home rule rhetoric and stand on a platform of ferocious unionism.

Janie Johnston ventures into a contradictory world where upper-class
fox hunters dressed in Alice bands and loden jackets raise money for
animal charities.
IT'S a very odd thing to cherish one's dogs and horses but send the
children off to boarding school, to vote for the party of acquisition
and looking after number one, yet throw oneself into good works. Some
people enjoy fox-hunting while supporting animal charities. They're a
rum lot, the ladies and gentlemen bountiful, as can be seen at many a
fete and fair.
At the door to the charity bazaar we were issued with tickets by
persons every bit as gracious as their royal patron. They should have
been dispensing black velvet Alice bands instead. Help was at hand. A
stall was bedecked with hairbands in black velvet or the socially
correct tartan or burgundy.
Even this early in the circuit of the hall it appeared that a rigorous
colour code was in operation. Dark green was obligatory, red piping
round the edges permitted, tartan highly desirable, navy condoned, and
purple, orange, turquoise and yellow outlawed. Because of the early hour
and informal setting, black was beyond the pale except on patent pumps
and the hairbands aforementioned.
This limited palette of colours, as worn by the narrow stratum of
society here gathered, applied not only to customers and stallholders
but also to the clothes and goods for sale. Had everyone come early to
buy, then nipped into the lavatory (Sloanespeak is contagious) to
change?
Style co-ordination was also in evidence. The serious social climber
would be well-advised to invest in a jacket, cardigan, coat or cape
based loosely on Tyrolean costume. A pewter-buttoned cropped jacket in
moss-green loden cloth piped with burgundy would be just the thing.
Nostalgia is a force irresistible to the county set. Pie-frill blouse
collars and watch-chains with fobs really grab them by the throat.
Victoriana was all around. There were nineteenth-century inspired
cakes, cards and toys, but above all children. Those boys and girls not
yet old enough to be incarcerated in boarding school were all decked up
as miniature adults, after the manner of generations past. There were
enchanting little ones too numerous to count. One small girl scored
maximum points by wearing loden, tartan, button-strapped round-toed
shoes and headband.
Flower of the month was primula auricula. It was everywhere done to
death. ''It used to be my favourite flower, but now I'll have to uproot
them from my garden,'' said a wag in the crowd.
One gets the impression that selling things for money represents
slumming for the vast majority of the stallholders. But they need have
no fears -- it's been fashionable for some years. It's what Tatler once
memorably referred to as a case of ''nobs take yobs' jobs''. Provided
the product or service is twee enough, for instance pertaining to decor,
there is no longer any shame attached to ''trade''.
Some cottage industries ventured below stairs to gentrify such
everyday objects as enamel jugs, milkmaids' stools and jars of jam. A
spot of naive paintwork here, a bit of decoupage there, and an instant
bygone has been created by Charlotte or Alexandra, Camilla or Tiggy.
The pictures on place-mats, painted furniture and little boxes on sale
drew inspiration from Stubbs and the sporting print. The main themes
were dogs, cats, horses, pigs and every dear little animal except one.
The young of the human species was notable by its absence.
On the last turn round the hall, the impression persisted that one had
gatecrashed some weekend house party. This was really a get-together of
intimates, an event pencilled annually on the social calendar. The
unworthy thought occurred that if the ladies and gentlemen bountiful,
the political party they espouse and their royal patrons clung on less
tenaciously to the world's goodies there might be less need for charity
in the first place. I wonder if it ever crosses their minds?

After a series of cutbacks in scheduled overseas services, is Glasgow
Airport's status as a major international gateway under threat?
WITH passenger numbers soaring to record levels and #110m spent on
improved facilities, the operators of Glasgow Airport appear to have
good reason to be on cloud nine.
But the news that 5.4 million people passed through the airport last
year, an increase of almost 9% on the previous year, comes just days
after the latest in a series of announcements of withdrawals or cutbacks
in scheduled international services from Glasgow.
At the end of last week, the German airline Lufthansa said it was
planning to withdraw direct weekday services to Frankfurt and replace
them with feeder flights to Manchester. Earlier in the week, Air France
announced it was dropping its daily service from Glasgow to Paris.
In recent months, United and Northwest have axed their services to
Washington and Boston respectively, and a third transatlantic carrier,
American, has suspended its flights to Chicago until the summer.
A major factor in each case appears to have been a lack of business
travellers. Even with transatlantic services, where you may have no
problem filling aircraft with leisure travellers, the airlines say
flights are simply not commercially viable unless there are enough
passengers paying business-class rather than economy fares.
In terms of prestige alone, such cuts must be a severe blow for an
airport which wishes to be seen as a major international centre.
While operators Scottish Airports, part of BAA, insist that these
losses will not affect Glasgow's continuing success, Vernon Murphy,
managing director of Scottish Airports, recently warned that he was
increasingly concerned about the lack of business traffic using direct
services and choosing instead to go via London or continental airports.
Commenting on the recent series of cutbacks, Geoff Runcie, chief
executive of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said yesterday: ''I think
the business community does need, and in some cases demands, direct
services out of Glasgow, and it is very sad when you see direct carriers
pulling out. But it is not satisfactory to blame the business community.
They bear some responsibility, but not the bulk of it.''
Reasons for the cutbacks had included global reviews by airlines of
their operations, rather than the straight merits of the affected route
alone, he pointed out.
Another factor was that the business community had suffered several
years of very difficult trading conditions, he added, and many business
people had been cutting their costs by travelling economy class or not
flying at all.
He suggested airlines could do more to tailor their services to the
actual size of the market, perhaps by using smaller long-haul aircraft
and by reviewing the fare structure with its ''fairly hefty'' business
class premium.
Glasgow Airport is reckoned by its operators to be the third-busiest
charter airport in the UK, after Gatwick and Manchester. About 60% of
its three million international passengers travel by charter rather than
schedule flights.
But does this dominance of the charter business and the recent loss of
some scheduled services in any way affect Glasgow's desired status as a
major international airport?
Mr Runcie said: ''Its kudos as an international gateway is a
subjective thing. All the people going on holiday are international
travellers. It is just semantics. The airport is growing strongly and I
believe it will continue to be successful.''
His optimism is shared by the airport's operators, who have invested
#110m in the last few years on improvements, including a new
international departure lounge and pier opened in November.
Sandy Ferrar, head of public affairs, said of the newly-announced
record passenger figures: ''That is the equivalent of the entire
population of Scotland going through Glasgow Airport every 12 months. It
is very encouraging in terms of the positive view most people have of
air travel in Scotland.''
The recent losses of scheduled flights formed a tiny percentage of the
airport's overall business, he stressed. In any case, some of the
remaining transatlantic carriers were planning more scheduled flights
this year. Moreover, the overall number of scheduled flights out of
Glasgow remained much higher than it had been, say, four years ago.
That last point is echoed by Kieran Daly, commercial aviation editor
with Flight International magazine. He said: ''Glasgow has lost some
services if you look back over the short term, but over the past two
years or so it has gained services.
''Of course it is bad news to lose services, but there is a brighter
future than that: the underlying trend is quite firmly up, it is a good
steady growth.''

<HEADLINE>Clyde yard wins #12.5m order for supply ship</HEADLINE>

FERGUSON Shipbuilders of Port Glasgow yesterday maintained its recent
run of success by unveiling a new #12.5m contract which will help create
50 jobs.
The order, for a North Sea platform supply vessel, takes the Clyde
yard's total business to #100m since it was privatised in 1989.
It also means the workforce will have increased tenfold over the last
five years. After the buy-out from British Shipbuilders, Ferguson
employed 34 people but recruitment over the next few months will take
the staff to about 350 in an area of high unemployment.
Yesterday's contract was signed with the long-established Glasgow
company, Harrisons (Clyde), and was won in the face of opposition from
17 other yards worldwide. It includes an option for a second supply
ship.
Mr Iain Harrison, chairman of Harrisons, said: ''We are delighted to
be able to build the vessel on the Clyde. Quite simply, Ferguson
provided us with the most competitive bid despite intense overseas
competition.''
The vessel will be operated out of Aberdeen by the company's
subsidiary, Stirling Shipping, on charter to Shell Expro. Built to a
Norwegian design, she will be one of the largest in the UK sector of the
North Sea.
Mr Bill Scott, Ferguson's chief executive, said the contract, combined
with three other orders which were confirmed late last year, would
ensure work for the yard well into 1996. The new vessel is due for
delivery in June next year.
He said: ''We have had to create a reputation out of nothing. The fact
that the yard is now well established is very much down to the workforce
in terms of quality and cost-effectiveness.''
Mr Scott pointed out that all seven ships so far completed by Ferguson
had been delivered ahead of schedule.
The yard is currently working on a replacement for the Caledonian
MacBrayne car ferry, Suilven, to be used on the Ullapool-Stornoway
route, which will be launched in April and delivered this summer.
Other orders on its books include two tugs for Shetland Towage, and a
ferry for the Red Funnel Group of Southampton.

CAPTAINS of industry are to prepare a ''code of good practice'' in the
wake of the growing furore over executive pay rises, it was announced
yesterday.
Marks and Spencer's chairman, Sir Richard Greenbury, will chair a
group of business leaders which will review the structure for working
out pay and conditions for company directors and other senior managers.
The Confederation of British Industry, which is setting up the group,
said public confidence in the fairness and openness of procedures used
to set directors pay had ''taken a knock''.
The Prime Minister has been greatly embarrassed by recent highly
publicised rises for business leaders, including the 75% increase
awarded to Mr Cedric Brown, the British Gas chief executive.
The group -- which will report in six months -- will include
representatives of the Institute of Directors, the Association of
British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds, and the
Stock Exchange as well as a number of business leaders including
Whitbread's chairman, Sir Michael Angus, ICI's chairman, Sir Denys
Henderson, and BP's chief executive, Mr David Simon.
News of the initiative comes a week before Mr Brown and several other
recipients of similarly ''excessive'' pay increases are due to be
questioned by the Commons Employment Select Committee.
It also coincides with an announcement of 400 redundancies at South
West Water whose chairman's pay increased from #49,000 before
privatisation to #112,000 last year.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said of the new group: ''While it is
welcome, it is not enough unless backed up by Government action.'' The
Government, he said, was trying to run away from its own responsibility
in relation to the privatised gas, water, and electricity industries.

LOCAL authority leaders are set for an angry confrontation with
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang on Friday as they protest about what they
claim is the worst financial settlement for councils in 20 years.
They will warn him that in many areas the public faces large rises in
council tax as a result of the Government's spending cutbacks for
1995-96.
Council taxes, the convention has predicted, could increase by around
10% on average, with higher increases in some areas. Total Government
financial support for council spending next year will rise by only
0.64%.
Cosla chiefs have attacked the Government for making no provision in
the settlement for inflation or for pay settlements awarded to council
employees.
Convention president Councillor Rosemary McKenna will also go on the
offensive at the meeting in Edinburgh over what she has said is the
Government's attempt to shift the burden of taxation from central to
local government in order to help it produce tax cuts nearer the General
Election.
Strathclyde region has been one of the worst hit by the settlement,
which requires the hard-pressed council to find cuts of #107m --
equivalent to 5500 jobs. The grant reduction also opens up the
possibility of council tax increases of between 25% and 40%.
Council leaders are seeking an urgent meeting with the Secretary of
State to plead for concessions but, in the short term, they propose to
reduce drastically the number of temporary contract employees (excluding
teaching, police, fire, urban programme, and water staff) and put a bar
on recruitment for full-time posts.
The Labour leader, Councillor Robert Gould, said: ''We have looked at
possible cuts of #66.5m, which would result in a 40% increase in council
tax. Many of these are politically unacceptable.
''If we did nothing about the #107m shortfall, it would mean a 65%
increase in council tax. If we achieve the cuts of #107m, it would still
mean a 25% increase in council tax.''
He emphasised that there would be no question of setting an illegal
budget. ''We won't be doing a Liverpool,'' he declared.
However, he said there was a strong possibility that compulsory
redundancies among full-time staff might have to be considered.
Finance chairman, Councillor John Mullin, said: ''This is the most
critical year we've ever faced in the 20 years of our existence. The
Government has deliberately cut our funds to fund vital services.
''There's a very cynical, political message coming from the Secretary
of State. He's trying to force cuts in staff and services, thereby
promoting privatisation by the back door.''
Lothian region also faces problems. Earlier this month,
Edinburgh-based council leaders met local MPs to tell them that Lothian
would have to make cuts of #33.5m to stay within the Government-imposed
capping limits.
One possible result could be across-the-board reductions in services
of 4%, along with increases in charges for school meals, home helps, and
meals on wheels. Also at risk are discretionary services such as nursery
provision, concessionary fares, and grants to the voluntary sector.
In Aberdeen, Grampian region's Liberal Democrat/SNP administration
faces the prospect of having to make cuts of #31m to remain within the
capping limit set by the Government.
To alleviate the situation it is attempting to sell off industrial
ground leases reputed to be worth #20m. In addition, more than 3000
regional council employees have been asked to consider taking early
retirement packages.
In the Borders, council leaders have warned that spending cuts,
voluntary redundancies, and a rise of up to 15% in council tax bills
will be needed to solve the financial situation facing the council.
Council officials there have described the capping limits for next
year as being quite unrealistic.

TRIBUTES were paid yesterday to the historian and broadcaster, Dr Ian
Grimble, who was found dead at his home in Bettyhill, Caithness, at the
weekend. He was 73.
He was born in Hong Kong of Scottish parents, and educated at Balliol
College, Oxford, where he developed his interest in Gaelic poetry as
well as winning the university high-jump event.
The Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, said: ''He was a
tremendous chap who made history come alive. His death is a great loss
to Scotland and to history.''
Fellow historian John Prebble said: ''There were many things in my
earlier books which I could not have written without his help and
advice.
''His contribution was immense but I do not think he got the
recognition he should have had. His scholarship was of a very high level
and, unlike other popular historians, involved a great deal of original
research.''
Lorn Macintyre writes: Before Ian Grimble Scottish history came from
books, too often in the form of dull lessons.
But from the 1960s, when Ian first stood in front of a television
camera, the tall thin former high-jumper, who looked and sounded like a
gentleman scholar, made Scottish history a compelling subject through
his eloquence and authority.
In classic series such as Who are the Scots? and The Scottish Nation,
he told us what we should be proud of, in virtuoso performances without
an autocue.
He told me once about the making of one of the series, and revealed:
''I spent three days in Edinburgh and had to do the seven programmes,
one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and on the third day, two in
the morning and one in the afternoon.
''I couldn't have looked at any of the scripts; if I'd looked at one,
I'd have been lost. They were done without rehearsals. I went straight
from one to the other.''
His interest in Scottish history grew from his childhood recollection
as a small boy in 1920s Hong Kong, when he had listened spellbound to
his expatriate parents reciting tales from Scottish history.
He developed a life-time passion for all things Highland, and pursued
his fascination at Balliol College where he was introduced to the poetry
of Duncan Ban Macintyre in seminars on the great Gaelic poet.
But his diverse career took him away from his Gaelic studies.
He was commissioned in the Intelligence Corps and served in India in
the Second World War. Then followed a stint as a House of Commons
librarian, before he joined the BBC as a producer in 1955. He helped to
set up the first VHF local radio service in Britain, for the new masts
at Rosemarkie, Thrumster and Orkney, which he saw as a vital
contribution to local culture.
To prove his commitment to the Highlands, Grimble not only learned to
read and write Gaelic, but as a ''very mature'' student went to Aberdeen
University to do his doctorate based on a study of Gaelic society of the
North of Scotland. He tried to settle in the Highlands, at Bettyhill,
but lack of work opportunities defeated him.
It distressed him to have to sell his house at Bettyhill, but he
returned often to stay with friends ''who've forgiven me my betrayal'',
as he told me in an interview for The Herald in 1986, and later he
bought another house there, in which he was to die.
One only has to read through his list of publications to see how
Highland history benefited from his knowledge and literary skills.
His books include the Trial of Patrick Sellar, the villain of the
Sutherland clearances, a study of Robert Burns, and a celebration of a
great Gaelic poet in The World of Rob Donn.
But he also wrote books about Scotland in general, including Scottish
Islands, Castles of Scotland, and a novel, A Start in Life. He sent me
an advance copy of this and asked me for my opinion on it.
I am grateful for that afternoon we spent nine years ago in the
sunlight of Tobermory, while he waited for his guests to finish lunch
and rejoin the bus tour for which he was the guide, taking people round
the islands, and giving them the benefit of his observations on history.
''I have to be careful that I'm not prosecuted,'' that mischievous but
scrupulously truthful man who regarded himself as a ''student of social
history'' told me. ''I don't say into the microphone what I think of
certain island lairds.''
Lewis was his favourite island because that was where ''Scottish
civilisation was least undermined by the attempts to persecute the Gaels
out of existence''. But in his half century of dedication to Gaelic
culture Grimble helped to contribute to its resurgence through his
television appearances, his writing, and his co-founding of Strathnaver
Museum.
The Government support that Gaelic is now receiving through the Gaelic
Television Fund must have delighted him. What a pity it did not come
earlier, when he was in his prime as a television communicator.

THE disciplinary inquiry into the break-out of three dangerous
prisoners serving life at Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight is to be headed
by Mr Alan Walker, the outgoing deputy chief executive of the Scottish
Prison Service.
Mr Walker leaves his post at the end of March to become an adviser on
prisons to the Council of Europe, auditing prison systems in nations
seeking entry to the European Union and advising on best penal practice.
He has been in charge of investigating security and disciplinary matters
since 1991.
The hearings at Parkhurst will start immediately, and will provide
what the English prison service yesterday described as ''an independent
examination of the conduct of staff in relation to the escape''.
As that announcement was made, the new governor of Parkhurst was
named. He is to be Mr Max Morrison, 50, governor of the adjacent Albany
high security prison on the island and a former deputy at Parkhurst. Mr
John Marriott, the governor, was removed from his post after the escape.
He was widely regarded as a scapegoat.

<TEXT>
A FORMER High Court judge is facing a prison sentence after he was
found guilty yesterday of fiddling thousands of pounds in fees for
immigration appeal work.
For about two years Ernest Aragon, 68 -- who called the Court of
Appeal's only woman judge to give character evidence about him -- signed
forms falsely claiming more than #10,000 of taxpayers' cash for hundreds
of cases he dishonestly claimed he had processed.
But Southwark Crown Court heard that in reality the case files lay in
piles, untouched and ignored, at his home.
Some of the cases involved people who had been waiting for months for
permission to enter Britain for urgent medical treatment.
Aragon, who could be jailed for up to 10 years, had sentence adjourned
until February 17 for reports.
The former judge, who was spoken highly of by Lady Justice
Butler-Sloss during his six-day trial, tried to convince police that he
had simply not noticed the files missing after his son had put them in a
cupboard without telling him.
Mr Peter Grieves-Smith, prosecuting, described the explanation as
absolute nonsense.
''If all those had gone missing Mr Aragon would definitely and
certainly have noticed them,'' he said.
Aragon -- a former judge at the High Court in Kenya, where his
judicial colleagues included Lady Justice Butler-Sloss's husband, Joseph
-- committed the offences while working as a part-time adjudicator for
the Immigration Appellate Authority, the court was told.
His job was to deal with appeals against rulings made by the Foreign
Office and the Home Office.
They involved applicants who wanted to stay in the UK and others from
all over the world wishing to enter the country.
Mr Grieves-Smith said: ''He was making decisions that affect peoples'
lives.''
The jury heard the former judge, of New Malden, Surrey, who was found
guilty of four sample charges of obtaining property by deception, was
paid #221 for a seven-hour day.
But during most of 1992 and 1993 he received more than #10,000 he had
no right to have.
Mr Grieves-Smith said that when it became clear that Aragon had a lot
of outstanding cases, he was asked to return them, but only brought in a
carrier bag containing 56.
When his home was searched a further 601 were discovered, most of
which had never been touched.
The former judge told the court he had never been dishonest, insisting
he claimed fees after dividing his cases into categories and estimating
how long they would take him.
After being allowed bail, he said he was discussing a possible appeal
with his legal advisers.

AN innovative method of warning young people of the dangers of drugs
was launched yesterday.
Using computer technology, a CD-rom has been created which illustrates
in graphic detail the risks involved.
The project, the first of its kind in Britain, has been pioneered by
Strathclyde Regional Council and Strathclyde Police who are alarmed by
the increase in availability of most drugs throughout Scotland.
The computer programs will be distributed soon to schools throughout
the country.
The CD-Rom, entitled Real Deal, will allow pupils to watch graphics
and listen to the dangers and legal consequences of becoming involved in
the drugs scene.
The disc is aimed at fifth and sixth year pupils, although the age
limit could be revised downwards depending on the project's success.
The package was made possible through financial support from ICI. It
provides pupils with information on types of drugs and situations in
which they are likely to be offered them. It will also enhance other
anti-drugs schemes operating in schools.
Launching the venture, Mr Bill Perry, convener of Strathclyde region,
described the move as ''vital'', particularly as schoolchildren were
becoming ''alarmingly streetwise about drugs early on''.
He said: ''We are hoping that the contents of this disc will give them
the skills necessary to say 'no' to drugs. It is the first time that
this kind of technology has been used in such a way, and it reflects the
computer-dominated environment in which we now live.
''The drugs culture can blight young lives and we must do everything
in our power to warn pupils of the dangers involved if they embark down
this particular road.''
The assistant chief constable of Strathclyde Police, Mr Crispian
Strachan, said: ''The first step for any organisation in combating the
abuse of drugs is to inform young people so they understand the
substances and the dangers.
''This innovative CD is an excellent way of providing information.
''It also gives young people the chance to find out themselves about
drugs without someone preaching at them.''
According to Mr Ken Cunningham, head teacher of Hillhead High School,
where the launch was staged, it is important parents also learn the
information on the disc.
''The biggest difficulty we have found recently is actually ensuring
that parents keep up to date with the drugs scene in order that they too
can warn their children of the huge risks involved.
''The CD approaches the problem of drugs in a real and realistic
way.''
While welcoming the project, 16-year-old William Wong, a fifth-year
pupil at Hillhead, said he already knew much of the information on the
disc.
Nevertheless, he believed many youngsters would learn much from it.

WINDS of 80mph lashed central Scotland yesterday, disrupting transport
and felling trees.
A gust of 85mph was reported at the Forth road bridge, where cars and
small vans were still able to cross, but high-sided and light vehicles
had to be diverted to the Kincardine Bridge.
Police in Lothian and Borders dealt with 400 calls in 12 hours from
midnight on Sunday because of the weather. Edinburgh was particularly
badly hit.
Helen Colville, 65, from Easter Drylaw Bank, Edinburgh, received face,
head, and spinal injuries when she was struck by wooden boarding near
her home.
Several trains were delayed when the line between Glasgow and
Edinburgh was closed for an hour after a tree was blown down near Ratho,
Midlothian.
0 Trains on InterCity services had to run with caution between the
Forth Bridge and Haymarket because of tree branches being blown on to
the line, a spokesman said.
On the roads, a car was struck by a falling tree in the city's
Queensferry Road but the driver was unhurt.
Long delays were caused when a heavy goods vehicle overturned on the
Edinburgh city by-pass near the Dreghorn spur.
Two flats in a tenement in the city's Downfield Place, Dalry, were
evacuated after a chimney stack crashed through the roof.
An Edinburgh District Council spokesman said about 20 trees had been
blown down in the city.
Electricity supplies were cut off for two hours in the Falkirk Road
area of Linlithgow when a pole snapped, pulling down a cable.
Two heavy goods vehicles were blown over on the westbound carriageway
of the M9 west of Newbridge.
The conditions were caused by strong southerly winds, which died down
later yesterday. However, Glasgow Weather Centre warned that the gales
were expected to return tonight.

AN insurance company has refused to pay out after a fire which
destroyed a cut-price tyre depot. It claims that the owner either
started the blaze deliberately or arranged for someone else to do it for
him.
Prudential Assurance alleges that the fire took place after Mr David
Sodden's tyre business ran into financial difficulties.
Mr Sodden's Cost Cutta Tyre Services premises at Clyde Workshops in
Fullarton Road, Tollcross, Glasgow, were destroyed by fire on June 7,
1992. He is now suing the Prudential Assurance Company for #100,000 in
the Court of Session.
Mr Sodden, of Lochar Place, Gardenhall, East Kilbride, made a claim on
Prudential Assurance in terms of his policy with the insurers.
Prudential alleged that the claim was fraudulent, refused to pay out,
and Mr Sodden raised the action in the Court of Session.
Mr Sodden yesterday asked temporary judge Mr Donald Macfadyen QC to
grant a decree in his favour without any evidence in the case having to
be heard. He argued that the allegations made by Prudential were not
enough to establish a case that he had started the fire deliberately or
connived at someone else doing it.
Prudential asked the judge to allow evidence to be heard on the basis
that if its allegations were accepted, the court would be entitled to
find that the fire was deliberate and that Mr Sodden had been involved.
The insurance company referred to the investigation into the blaze by
Strathclyde Fire Brigade.
Prudential pointed out that tyres were difficult to ignite and needed
exposure to sustained flame before they would catch fire. The insurers
said it had also been established that the fire had not started through
an electrical fault, and that the seat was not in an area where
combustible material had been stored.
Mr Macfadyen ruled that if these allegations were proved after
evidence was led it would be open to the court to decide that the fire
had been set deliberately.
As far as Mr Sodden's alleged involvement was concerned, the judge
also decided that Prudential had alleged enough to allow evidence to be
heard.
Mr Sodden was alleged to have been in the premises and to have left
alone at about 9pm, some three hours before the fire was reported.
Prudential claimed that he had changed his statement to police,
retracting his admission that he had returned to the premises after 5pm.
The insurers also alleged that Mr Sodden had suggested that the blaze
had been started deliberately by someone who had forced entry through
the roof, and that the roof had been destroyed.
In fact, Prudential says, the roof is still intact, though warped, and
there was no sign of a forced entry.
The insurance company says that a change in the law in early 1992 over
the minimum depth for tyre treads reduced the market for part-worn
tyres. Mr Sodden was in financial difficulty, with a drop in his profits
and stock levels, it is alleged.
The judge ruled that evidence should be heard in the case at a later
date.

LIBERAL Democrats will today produce their own home-rule recipe in the
form of a Commons Bill giving Scotland its own law-making parliament.
It would have legislative powers in all matters except UK issues such
as defence, international affairs, and overall economic policy, which
would stay with Westminster.
The Scots body could also vary UK income tax up or down by 3p and
create a charter of rights and freedoms. A Scottish Prime Minister would
appoint Scots parliament MPs to a Scottish government.
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP for North-east Fife, who will
present the Bill, said: ''For all the talk about Scotland over the last
few days, only the Liberal Democrats have legislation to put on the
table.
''This Bill provides for the sort of parliament supported by a clear
majority of Scots.''

<HEADLINE>West Antrim conundrum may solve Tam's problem</HEADLINE>

FORGET the West Lothian Question, put it from your mind, bury it.
Consider instead another geographical and constitutional conundrum, The
West Antrim Question. Never heard of it? Don't worry, you will.
This new question is Labour's answer to another conundrum: What do we
do about Tam? Yesterday, considering Labour's stupendous lead in our
poll, some Labour MPs and activists were curiously reluctant to speak to
The Herald, especially if they realised we wanted to talk about the
rogue cannon loose on their deck, or to use a more apt metaphor, the
torpedo which had just been fired.
For from the party hierarchy down to members on the ground, there is a
realisation that there is no answer to the Tam Dalyell question,
certainly not in terms of silencing him, which would fail and simply
damage the authority of the leadership, or in punishing him, which would
thereby create a martyr.
The only tactic left is to ignore him wherever possible, and quietly
counter his arguments where ignoring him is not an option. To that end
Labour strategists have devised a new phrase, of soundbite length, for
our growing political lexicon: The West Antrim Question.
It is a good ploy and a sound argument. Why, it asks, did Stormont
operate for years, legislating on Northern Ireland's own matters
(however well or badly this was done), while MPs from the Province could
cheerfully vote at Westminister on matters affecting England and Wales
and Scotland without anyone complaining that there was an anomaly?
Tam's famous question could have been asked at any time during the
Stormont years, but it wasn't. No-one was demanding that Westminister
MPs from Down or Armagh be stripped of the right to speak in certain
debates, or cut down in number, or that spending in Northern Ireland be
slashed.
Nor is anyone saying this at present, now that an elected assembly in
Belfast is back on the agenda as part of a peace settlement. Of course,
one reason why Conservatives didn't point to any anomaly is that
Northern Ireland Unionists tend to vote with the Tories, whereas
Labour's dominance in Scotland could propel the party to office in
Westminster.
But that is an argument about power, not principle, and principles are
Tam's forte, a cussed devotion to what he believes is right which once
memorably drove Margaret Thatcher to observe: ''Oh no, here comes the
awkward squad.''
In his current intervention it can even be argued that he has done
Labour at least one small service. The party's Scottish secretary, Mr
Jack McConnell, explained: ''There were a number of people in Scotland
and elsewhere who believed that Scotland's Labour MPs were not as firm
on this issue as the party establishement were claiming them to be.
''This has proved that there is one and only one Scottish Labour MP
who is out on a limb over this. All the others from 1979 have realised
that the world has changed and that devolution is now a political
principle, not a party tactic. Tam has exposed that, and I don't think
there are many, if any, in the party in England who will come out
against it either.''
Over his 32 years in Westminster he has espoused a variety of causes
with the same level of dogged passion, often turning his campaigns into
books.
School ships, which he served on, devolution, science policy, the
Falklands, the Belgrano, the bomb over Lockerbie, the bombing of
Tripoli, all have attracted his fantastic and single-minded scrutiny
with equal fervour. His admirers point out that he is usually right,
those who have doubts say he is sometimes wrong.
And right or wrong, his approach is the same. If he is advised, even
by friends, that he may have got it wrong, he takes this as evidence
that he must be right. ''He is like a dog chewing an old shoe in a room
full of juicy bones,'' said one parliamentary colleague with a soft spot
for Tam. ''Nothing will distract him, and trying to only makes things
worse.''
Which is why Labour can and will do nothing to silence him, trusting
perhaps that by the next General Election Tam himself will have wearied
of the endless struggles and will decide to call it a day.

Nicosia, Monday
A CYPRUS court, faced with the promotion of one of three judges
hearing a murder case involving three British soldiers, asked the
defence and prosecution today to agree that the trial had not
effectively begun.
The president of Larnaca criminal court sought opinions from the
defence and prosecution by January 24 on whether the promotion
constituted a change in a court already hearing a trial.
The Cyprus Supreme Court will give a ruling on January 31 on the
criminal court's decision to grant a pre-trial hearing to decide if
prison warders had violated the soldiers' rights by taking away the
written notes of two of the accused.
Alan Ford, 26, from Birmingham; Justin Fowler, 25, from Falmouth,
Cornwall; and Jeff Pernell, 23, from Oldbury in West Midlands, are
accused of killing tour guide Louise Jensen, 23.
Her battered body was found in a shallow grave at Paralimni resort.
The soldiers, serving with the Royal Greenjackets, will remain in
detention in Nicosia Central Prison.--Reuter.

Paris, Monday
FILM star turned animal rights crusader Brigitte Bardot has backed
British protesters against cross-Channel shipment of live animals and
urged the French to stop eating veal and lamb.
''The Shoreham protests by courageous Britons refusing veal exports
towards our continent reflect just a small part of the horrific ordeals
undergone by animals,'' said Bardot in a statement about the campaign
against exporting calves.
''I call on all animal rights groups to join me in this fight and on
the French to refuse to eat small animals like veal calves and lambs as
long as humanitarian and sanitary measures are not taken to improve
conditions for transfers,'' she added.
Bardot, who has devoted her fortune and efforts to her animal defence
foundation since she retired from films 21 years ago, said: ''If man
wants to be a carnivore, let him at least have the dignity not to
inflict such a disgusting and unacceptable fate to the victims which he
kills to eat.''--Reuter.

Baghdad, Monday
IRAQ marked the fourth anniversary of the start of the Gulf War today
with defiant rhetoric and vows of ''no retreat, no concessions''.
In 1991 a formidable British and US-led multi-national force mounted
one of the most ferocious air and missile assaults in recent history to
force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
Although the 42-day campaign pushed Iraq out of Kuwait and forced
Baghdad to accept ceasefire terms set by the allies, Iraq is not taking
a defeatist view.
The Government is staging wide-ranging celebrations to mark the Mother
of Battles, Iraq's term for the war. In Baghdad, the streets are
festooned with ribbons and portraits of Saddam.
''Saddam is there at the helm of power, and now there is more hope on
the horizon for him to survive the sanctions than any time in the past
four years,'' said a Western diplomat.
That holds good despite Western pressures on Iraq in the form of Gulf
War ceasefire terms requiring the dismantling of weapons of mass
destruction and monitoring of Iraq's arms industry, as well as sanctions
barring sales of oil, Iraq's economic lifeblood.
UN arms inspectors have rid Iraq of its lethal weapons and potential
to produce them, but a UN special commission has complained that Baghdad
has not provided full information about some past programmes.
The trade sanctions have devastated Iraq's economy, leading to
hyper-inflation and untold misery and hardships for the population. The
UN Security Council decided last week to make no changes in the
sanctions for the time being.
Impoverished Iraqis, once used to a relatively affluent way of life,
scramble for a living. The crippling sanctions have reduced the majority
to subsistence on meagre Government rations which provide less than half
of a person's monthly needs for sugar, rice, bread, and cooking oil.
Despite sanctions-related suffering, Baghdad is still striking a
defiant chord, saying the allies failed to weaken President Saddam's
Government or force it to submit unconditionally to Washington's terms.
''We are determined not to retreat or give concessions. We shall
remain loyal to our leader and his path,'' said the ruling Ba'ath party
newspaper in a front-page editorial.
It said the US had drafted the Gulf War resolutions to get rid of the
Iraqi Government, but had failed.
''The Americans are frustrated . . . and the world laughs at them.
They thought within days they would install a frail alternative,'' said
al-Thawra.
Divisions in the Arab and Western alliance on how to deal with Baghdad
have come into the open. However, although differing on how to approach
the sanctions, the allies who fought Iraq in 1991 are now almost
unanimous that there is no viable alternative to the Government in
Baghdad.
''If anything, Saddam is holding a racially and religiously
heterogeneous country together. It seems the West's attempts to divide
Iraq on such grounds are bound to failure,'' said another
diplomat.--Reuter.

THE wind is whipping up waves on Linlithgow Loch. It would be a neat
metaphor for the storm stirred up by the local MP Tam Dalyell . . . if
only it were true.
The West Lothian Question? The whit? Oh Tam, oh him.
On the streets, outside Presto, in the pubs, at the boot-menders, in
the bus shelters, on the steps of the sheriff court, the constitutional
debate is nowhere raging.
Life goes on, and the resurrection of the hoary devolution anomaly,
returned to haunt Labour, is greeted with a great gust of apathy.
In Linlithgow, in Bathgate, in places in between, they regard their MP
with the kind of blithe indulgence often reserved for eccentric
great-uncles: Och, it's jist Tam again. Ye ken whit Tam's like.
In the Footballers and Cricketers Arms, the question of Tam's
constitutional quandary hardly stirs the lunchtime drinkers from their
contemplation of another round.
Willie Calderwood, a retired miner, thinks his MP is wrong but, well,
that's his business. He says: ''I don't agree with him, no. But it's up
to him.''
James Russell, a retired pallet maker, says he's a good man: ''He has
his own thoughts. I'm not against him. I keep voting for Tam, and if he
thinks he's right, well that's right by me.''
Steve Maguire, a psychologist, gazes into his pint as if reading
runes: ''I don't see there's any way he'll be deselected. He's like the
local laird: unimpeachable.''
Alex Romanes wonders why everyone's paying him so much attention:
''It's his old argument. Maybe they think he should just shut up. They
won't stifle him, though.''
For George Hogg, an offshore worker, Tam is an issue politician:
''He's no career politician. You have to understand. Tam has changed. In
his time, Tam has changed his party, changed his religion; whatever
suits Tam, Tam does.''
Selina Paterson, and her friend, Emily Drysdale, both from Blackburn,
don't know about the constitutional debate and care even less.
''He helped me last year with a problem, that's all I know about
him,'' Selina says.
''Yes, but we want a Scottish parliament don't we?'' Emily asks. ''But
so does Tam Dalyell, doesn't he?''
Jean McPherson, pushing her trolley out of the supermarket, is blunt:
''Politicians? I'm sick of the lot of them. Tam Dalyell? Is that yon
with the big house, the Binns? Anyway, it's his right to say what he
thinks. Even if he's wrong.''
Hazel Campbell, a retailer in the town, believes the time has come for
Scotland to have its own parliament.
She said: ''I favour devolution as opposed to complete independence,
to begin with anyway. I would disagree with what Mr Dalyell is saying
although I respect the fact that he has the right to speak up for what
he believes to be the case.''
Liz Steel, on the other hand, doesn't want devolution and believes her
MP's outspokenness has probably damaged his party's chances of winning
the next election -- a fact she about which she is more than happy.
Sometimes straw polls turn up anomalies and we had, it seems, turned up
one of West Lothian's Conservative voters.
In Bathgate, drenched voters seemed no less sanguine about the actions
of their MP.
''He's quite right. I'm a Labour supporter and devolution seems like a
waste of money,'' said Colin Sneddon, 23, a baker from Armadale.
''There has to be discussion on this and it's better done before the
election. So I support Tam entirely on this.''
Martin Malone, 20, and Scott McAngus, 21, thought their MP had got it
wrong.
''Never mind worrying about what questions he'll get to ask down
there. He should be up here in a Scottish parliament asking questions;
like when are we going to get a job,'' Mr Malone said.
Both agreed they favoured a Scottish parliament. Within the UK.
Probably.
Kathleen Wilson from Whitburn didn't agree with her MP but said he was
right to raise his concerns: ''It won't damage him. He has a
stranglehold on the votes here.''
The response of the voters though is not shared by those within the
Linlithgow constituency Labour Party. One long-time activist admits he
is tearing out what hair he has left.
He commented : ''Tam said, 'Look I can't see me changing my ways'. We
said, 'Tam for God's sake you're standing on the edge of the precipice,
don't walk over.' You know Tam, though. He's more likely to dive.''

Moscow, Monday
RUSSIAN Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev is seeking a Clinton-Yeltsin
summit in Moscow in May. He will press for the meeting when he sees
American Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Geneva tomorrow, his
Ministry said today.
Tass suggested that President Clinton had already received and
accepted an invitation for summit talks with Yeltsin.
''There is an invitation and it is the intention of President Clinton
to come to Moscow at that time,'' a Russian Foreign Ministry official
told Tass.
Washington confirmed that summit plans would probably be discussed
tomorrow.
Yeltsin described the last summit in Washington in September as ''the
best visit of my life as president'', although he and Clinton agreed to
differ on several issues.
However relations have since become more strained because of
differences over plans to expand Nato into eastern Europe and over the
war in Bosnia.
Washington has also called for a halt to fighting in Chechnya and has
expressed concern over Russia's handling of the crisis.
The Russian Ministry official said the Geneva meeting had not been
called to discuss Chechnya, but he accepted that it was likely to come
up.
''We do not deny that the human rights aspect of this issue is not the
concern of Russia alone,'' he said.
American officials have said Chechnya is likely to be the first topic
raised in Geneva.
Christopher has called the Russian army's intervention in the
breakaway region a setback for democracy, but he added that Washington
still backed Yeltsin.--Reuter.

Blaby,
IN what will go down as a remarkable U-turn in Scottish political
history, Linlithgow MP Tam Dalyell last night admitted he had been wrong
to warn that devolution would damage Labour's electoral prospects.
Emerging from a meeting with Labour activists in Leicestershire, he
said his 16-years' silence on the constitutional debate had left him
''in the position of Rip van Winkle''.
Mr Dalyell came to Blaby, in the English Tory heartland, to warn that
Labour's proposals for constitutional reform would cost the party votes
in England at the next General Election.
He told a packed branch meeting in Lord Lawson's former constituency
that the ''brutal truth'' was that Labour's proposals for a Scottish
parliament, Welsh assembly, and English regional assemblies, would
severely damage Labour's chances.
But after a lengthy and detailed question and answer session, Mr
Dalyell said he had been wrong and suggested politics had changed in the
16 years since he last spoke out on devolution.
''I believe it's possible that many of my fears are not founded. I
feel a little like Rip van Winkle. Obviously on the basis of this
meeting my judgment was wrong. I'm very glad to have come here.''
Mr Dalyell was told by those at the meeting that there was little
objection to the principle of a Scottish parliament, and firm support
for the idea of English regions. The West Lothian Question remains
unanswered, but Mr Dalyell was encouraged not to cause divisions within
the party.
One activist told him: ''I do hope that you will come up with positive
alternatives to the problems raised by the West Lothian Question. We
want you to be, to quote President Truman, the man in the Labour Party
tent pissing out and not the man outside the tent pissing in.''
Mr Dalyell admitted that he would have to rethink his fears on the
effects devolution would have on a General Election. He said: ''If Blaby
is typical, which I suspect it may be, of the East Midlands, it would
require me to rethink many of the concerns about the English response to
Scottish devolution.
''What is abundantly clear is that attitudes in the English Labour
Party as represented by this extremely well attended and heavyweight
meeting have changed significantly in 16 years.''
But he still believes that the West Lothian Question remains
unanswered. ''They took on board the validity of the West Lothian
Question but were themselves prepared to swallow it provided a regional
assembly was set up soon in the East Midlands.''
Earlier he had told the meeting that Labour's promised constitutional
reforms would lose English votes.
He argued that: ''If we take away from Westminster and give to a
Scottish assembly effective law-making powers, effective tax-raising
powers over health, transport, and housing, by what possible right do 72
Scottish MPs at Westminster continue to vote on health, transport, and
housing for England?''
Referring to the criticism he has faced from within the party, Mr
Dalyell said : ''Some parliamentary colleagues have called me a spectre
from the past. My concern is for the future of the Labour Party, that
these proposals will make it harder for a Labour government to be
elected.''
Mr Dalyell was invited last year in Blackpool to Blaby to address a
branch meeting of the Enderby and District Labour Party. The topic was
chosen by the branch despite the MP's offer to speak on Lockerbie or
higher education.
His decision to break silence on devolution was prompted by Mr Major's
attack on constitutional reform launched on December 30.
As recently as a month ago Mr Dalyell's parliamentary colleagues were
claiming that he no longer believed the West Lothian Question applied,
and that he fully supported Labour's plans.
On Sunday, Mr Dalyell spent four hours defending himself before his
Linlithgow constituency party. A threat of deselection has been made, on
what sources claim was the prompting of some of the MP's Labour
colleagues.

Washington, Monday
A US Defence Department investigation has cleared Gulf War hero
General Norman Schwarzkopf of allegations that he benefited improperly
from the help of military personnel while compiling his memoirs.
Pentagon Inspector General Derek Vander Schaaf found no improprieties
in assistance given by three US Air Force officers to the retired
general, who commanded UN coalition troops against Iraq in the 1990-91
Gulf Crisis.
However the report concludes that an Army major and a Navy chief petty
officer should not have made 140 trips to Schwarzkopf's home at US
Government expense. Later Schwarzkopf said he was unaware that the
Government had paid for the trips and reimbursed the Treasury Department
$1608 (#1000) for the mileage costs.
Vander Schaaf said the trips amounted to actions ''beyond those
related to official Government business'', but added: ''We do not
believe consideration of disciplinary action is warranted in the
matter.''
A former chairman of the House Government Operations Committee,
Congressman John Conyers, had alleged that officers improperly worked as
Schwarzkopf's aides in the preparation of his best-selling book, It
Doesn't Take a Hero, and that the retired general gained improper access
to secret documents.--AP.

Port Moresby, Monday
A SECURITY alert surrounding the Pope was eased today as he arrived in
Papua New Guinea to be greeted by a crowd of 30,000 at the airport.
Police in the South Pacific country were placed on alert two hours
before the Pope's arrival when they discovered that two Iranian men had
checked out of their hotel and could not be found.
Security men were worried that the two might be connected to an
alleged assassination plot uncovered in Manila last week at the start of
the Pope's four-nation tour.
As the Pope addressed the welcoming crowd at Jacksons International
Airport in the capital, Port Moresby, security officials were deciding
whether he should travel in a covered car instead of the open-air
Popemobile.
A secret service officer at the airport said: ''We are treating this
very, very seriously.''
Despite the alert the Pope travelled in the open vehicle along the
nine miles of pot-holed road into the city centre to celebrate an
evening Mass.
The two Iranians flew in from Manila in December, but security
officials in Papua New Guinea were not told of their presence until
today.
''It was just a routine computer scan in Papua New Guinea and these
two gentlemen's names appeared,'' said police Chief Superintendent Denis
Samin. ''You don't get many Iranians here.
''Immigration alerted us because of the problems in Manila. There was
speculation that they may have been connected to the four in Manila, but
we don't think so at this stage.''
At least two people were arrested over an alleged Muslim extremist
plot to kill the Pope in the Philippines and police there are still
looking for another 20 suspects.
Chief Superintendent Samin said Papua police were asking the two
Iranians to contact police. ''They are somewhere in the country,'' he
said.
''The two men should come forward and disclose their whereabouts to
police or immigration officials to clear themselves of any further
speculation.''
Police said they would tighten security for the remainder of the
three-day Papal tour.
In his airport speech, the Pope pleaded for peace on the mainly Roman
Catholic Papua New Guinea island of Bougainville, where rebels are
fighting a six-year independence campaign that has led to heavy loss of
life.
The Pope told the crowd that it was a ''joy to return to this
beautiful country''. He last visited in 1984.--Reuter.

THE Labour Party has reached its highest level of support in Scotland
for more than a decade and its 57% showing is its second-best
achievement in more than 20 years of System Three polling for The
Herald.
With a continuing slip by the SNP, of three points to 22%, the
two-point increase for Labour widens to 35 points, a gap between the
parties which last summer stood at 16%.
Labour revelled in figures which reflected the height of Tony Blair's
honeymoon period as new leader. However, opponents predicted that a
different picture would emerge when internal troubles and setbacks,
which have flared since the poll was carried out between January 4 and
10, reach voters.
With the Tories continuing in the doldrums, down one point at 11%, and
the Scottish Liberal Democrats up one to 9%, you have to go back to
April 1984 and an all-time high of 58% to find such a Labour
stranglehold on voting intentions. The 57% figure was matched twice, in
late 1980 and early 1981.
Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party,
called the rating ''a resounding vote of confidence for our plans for a
Scottish parliament, the modernisation efforts of our leader Tony Blair,
and our campaigns against VAT on fuel and railway privatisation''.
He added: ''The twin attacks by the Tories and Nats on our devolution
plans have backfired spectacularly and are a clear turn-off for voters.
While other parties have concentrated on attacking Labour, we have gone
out on the streets campaigning on the issues which matter to Scots.''
The SNP always makes the point that it polls highest when activity
away from Westminister is at its most feverish, and 1994 saw the
Monklands by-election, in addition to council and European elections,
pushing it high in the polls.
Its chief executive, Mr Michael Russell, claimed the latest poll for
The Herald had already been ''overtaken by events''.
He said: ''After a long period during which the political debate was
stuck firmly south of the Border -- which was to Labour's advantage --
it is only in the last week that it has been brought home again.''
Mr Andy Myles, chief executive of the Scottish Liberal Democrats,
pointed out that the poll highlighted two-thirds support for parties
backing the Scottish Constitutional Convention scheme for a Scottish
parliament. He added: ''This poll shows John Major's decision to put the
Scottish constitution at the top of the political agenda will not win
him any votes in Scotland.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, also
claimed events had moved on since the poll was taken. He said: ''This
poll was taken before Labour's policies on education, railways, Clause
4, and devolution started to unravel.''
System Three poll

The poll was taken among 1053 people in 40 constituencies between
January 5 and January 10. The figures may not add up because of the
effects of rounding up or down. It excludes 15% of respondents who
refused to indicate their preference, did not intend to vote or were
undecided.

Susan Smith, of Union, is charged with drowning her sons Michael,

In a case which has gripped Americans, Mrs Smith at first told police

nine days of tearful pleas for their return, she confessed that she had

From LESLIE ADLER
in Los Angeles
THE O J Simpson murder trial will mark a new chapter in live
television news broadcasting, with three cable channels providing live,
gavel-to-gavel coverage of a court case that seems scripted for
Hollywood.
''Many consider O J to be the most famous person to be put on trial in
this country,'' said David Talley, public relations manager for CNN,
which plans to broadcast the entire trial. ''It's got sports. It's got
Hollywood. It's got corporate America.''
Along with CNN, Ted Turner's all-news cable channel, the trial will be
shown live by E! Entertainment Television, a Los Angeles-based channel
focused on Hollywood, and Court TV, the New York-based channel devoted
to courtroom coverage.
All three say they are committed to airing the entire trial -- no
matter how long it lasts. Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, who is
presiding over the case, expects it to last up to six months.
America's three big television networks plan live coverage only of the
lawyers' opening statements and particularly newsworthy events in the
trial, which would include Simpson taking the witness stand.
However, ABC, CBS, and NBC do plan frequent news updates throughout
each day on the trial as well as coverage on their evening news
programmes.
Simpson's background as a football star-turned TV celebrity and actor
has from the start turned up the glare of the media spotlight on the
double murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend,
Ronald Goldman.
The two were found stabbed to death on June 12, outside her townhouse
in the affluent Brentwood section of Los Angeles. Simpson has pleaded
not guilty to the murders.
Since June 17, when television cameras in helicopters captured
Simpson's surreal flight from justice, the case has increased the role
of live television coverage and blurred the line between news and
entertainment.
The live coverage on all big networks and CNN of Simpson's low-speed
flight in a white Ford Bronco across Los Angeles freeways had millions
glued to their televisions before he finally gave himself up to police.
The chase logged the third-highest programme rating in 1994, behind
two top American football games, according to CNN.
In another development yesterday, Newsweek magazine and CNN reported
that blood found in Simpson's Ford matched that of the murder
victims.--Reuter.

THE royal saga last night switched back to Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles,
as she and her husband Andrew attacked a newspaper for publishing family
photographs.
They accused the Sun of publishing pictures ''copies of which have
either been purloined, without our consent or knowledge, from a family
album at our home or which have been taken inside our home, presumably
in our absence''.
Palace officials meanwhile investigated the apparent revelations by
the Prince of Wales's personal valet, Mr Ken Stronach. Charles's private
secretary, Commander Richard Aylard, is co-ordinating the inquiry into
how stories about Charles and Mrs Parker Bowles appeared in the News of
the World.
Mr Stronach, 50, has worked in the Prince's household for 15 years. He
has been suspended on full pay pending the internal investigation.
Next month the royal family and the privacy issue moves to the courts,
when the Princess of Wales sues gym owner Bryce Taylor over pictures
taken while she was exercising at the LA Fitness Club in west London.
The rare High Court action also includes Mirror Group Newspapers, which
published the photographs.
The statement from Mr and Mrs Parker Bowles, through their solicitors,
made no mention of legal action. It said only that the couple, who last
week announced they were to divorce, did not propose to ''respond
further at this stage''.
The Sun pointed out it had received no formal complaint from the
couple. Editor Stuart Higgins said: ''We note their interesting
comments. We have nothing further to say.''
The Sun yesterday published a set of pictures across eight pages of
Mrs Parker Bowles, her husband and the interior of their home,
Middlewick House, in Corsham, Wiltshire.
In the statement, the couple said: ''We have been asked to comment on
the publication today in the Sun of certain photographs which belong to
our family. When we announced last week that we intended to seek
divorce, we had hoped that our family's privacy would be respected.
''Less than a week later, the Sun has published photographs, copies of
which have either been purloined, without our consent or knowledge, from
a family album at our home or which have been taken inside our home,
presumably in our absence, and once again without our knowledge or
consent.''

ANATOLY VERBIN
Grozny, Monday
RUSSIAN artillery and mortar units pounded Grozny and troops clashed
with Chechen independence fighters in the streets today. As the war
entered its sixth week, meanwhile, Moscow offered peace talks and a
ceasefire.
''They are fanatics. They will go on fighting till the end,'' said a
Russian paratroop captain, fresh from a fierce clash with Chechen
fighters and still smelling of gunpowder.
He was speaking at the western Russian army's headquarters in what was
once a city park, about a mile from the central square and presidential
palace still held by troops loyal to Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev.
Officers said tonight that they had no orders to storm the palace.
In Moscow, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called for immediate
peace talks and a simultaneous ceasefire ''to stop the bloodshed''. In a
televised speech, he promised the costly Chechen campaign would not
spoil Russia's plans for a cost-cutting reform budget this year,
although he added that the Chechen campaign had so far cost five
trillion roubles (#1000m).
''We propose starting negotiations at once with all interested sides
and forces in Chechnya,'' Chernomyrdin told Moscow's Ostankino
television channel. ''The start of the negotiations would mean a
ceasefire at the same time.''
There were no clear gains for either side on the ground in battered
Grozny today. Russian and Chechen fighters each now hold patches of
territory inside the city, but Chechen fighters remained in control of
the centre and the palace, symbol of their resistance.
However heavy street fighting swirled around Grozny's railway station,
about one mile further south, as Chechen defenders battled Russian tanks
and troops trying to break through city centre front lines.
Thick plumes of black smoke from two fires in a refinery area
south-west of the city centre darkened skies over the capital.
Russian helicopters rained rockets on buildings which they believed
were being used by Chechen snipers and hit-and-run squads.
Russian marines and infantry marched through alleyways to the din of
exploding artillery shells, howitzers, and bursts of small arms fire.
Tanks and armoured personnel carriers roared off towards the
presidential palace. Some APCs returned later to headquarters to unload
their dead and injured. Doctors at the makeshift hospital said they
treated about 25-30 wounded men a day: ''But there have been days when
we treated up to 80,'' said one doctor.
In a sign of concern over the drawn-out conflict, President Boris
Yeltsin opted against travelling to Switzerland for an annual gathering
on financial affairs, the World Economic Forum, this month.
Yeltsin faces growing criticism of his decision to send troops and
tanks to Chechnya to quell its three-year independence drive.
In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stepped up his country's
criticism. ''Human rights, international law, and OSCE (Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe) principles are being violated in
unacceptable ways in Chechnya,'' he said.
''Preserving territorial integrity cannot be accomplished by reducing
whole neighbourhoods to rubble and ash.''--Reuter.

THE chief executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, Mr Donald John MacSween,
yesterday denied he had ignored what could have been fraud at the 1993
Airdrie Mod in order to win backing for his moves to dismiss the
organisation's director, Mr Donald MacLean.
He also denied Mr MacLean had been made a scapegoat for the Airdrie
Mod, which had failings as a venue.
Mr MacSween was giving evidence at the industrial tribunal in
Stornoway yesterday which is hearing Mr MacLean's claim of unfair
dismissal. He was suspended on January 14 last year four days after Mr
MacSween had taken up the post of chief executive. Mr MacLean had worked
for An Comunn for 16 years.
Mr MacSween told the tribunal he had suspended Mr MacLean in order
that an independent audit could be carried out on the Airdrie Mod. The
audit had concluded the fringe at the Airdrie Mod had lost #26,300
although An Comunn had only allowed for a #12,000 loss. This had
''accounted for a serious deterioration in An Comunn's funds'', Mr
MacSween said.
Mr MacSween's own investigations had also found that Mr MacLean had
bought jewellery worth #235 from a Californian company at the Mod, with
one piece being for his wife. In addition, Mr MacLean's sister, Mrs
Chrissie Gordon, a former part-time employee of An Comunn, had handed in
#100 in cash to the organisation's Stornoway office on January 18, four
days days after Mr MacLean had been suspended.
In response to questioning from An Comunn's solicitor, Mr David
Walker, Mr MacSween said it transpired this was payment by Mr Maclean
for the office's word processor which was being replaced by one costing
#1300. Mrs Gordon had asked that the receipt be dated January 9.
Mr MacLean had bought the machine as a present for his daughter. When
Mr Maclean was finally dismissed on March 29, letters from Mr MacSween
to him said the jewellery and the word processor would have been
retained without payment had it not been for the investigations.
Mr MacLean's solicitor, Mr Angus MacDonald, drew Mr MacSween's
attention to another section in the auditor's report which had found
that two Wolfestone concerts at Airdrie, which had attracted 400 people
and would have been expected to have had receipts of between #2000 and
#2800, had returned only #1000. Mr MacSween said he had asked Mr Billy
Kelly, the fringe organiser, for clarification.
''This is suggesting fraud, isn't it?'' Mr MacDonald asked, and then
suggested: ''The reason that you haven't taken action against Mr Kelly
is that you have come to some kind of agreement with Mr Kelly to back
moves with relation to Mr MacLean.''
Mr MacSween said the suggestion was ''preposterous'' and repeated that
Mr Kelly was not an An Comunn employee. Mr MacDonald said: ''I have
raised this with the auditor and she agrees that there are some very
serious questions that remain unanswered.''
Mr MacSween said: ''It should have been up to the auditor to make
recommendations.''
Mr MacDonald asked Mr MacSween why Mr MacLean sent money for the word
processor and had left the jewellery on his desk if he had intended to
steal them. It was surely unusual for a thief to draw attention to items
he was trying to steal. The tribunal continues.

<HEADLINE>Call to scrap Mental Health Act after death of therapist</HEADLINE>

THE killing of an occupational therapist in a psychiatric unit has led
to a call for the Mental Health Act to be scrapped.
Ms Georgina Robinson, 26, died in hospital after being stabbed a dozen
times in the neck by schizophrenic Andrew Robinson, 36, at Torquay's
Edith Morgan psychiatric centre.
An inquiry commissioned by South Devon Healthcare Trust was conducted
by a team of three, led by the former Mental Health Act Commission
chairman, Sir Louis Blom Cooper, QC.
The team's 200-page report, The Falling Shadow, published yesterday,
called Ms Robinson's killing ''random, motiveless, senseless''.
It demanded an official review of mental health legislation, with a
view to replacing what it termed the ''obsolescent'' Mental Health Act
1983.
At a news conference in Newton Abbot, Devon, after the report's
release, Sir Louis described the Act as a ''pretty bad piece of
draughtsmanship'' which needed ''a good spring clean''.
Ms Robinson's mother, Mrs Wendy Robinson, from Fairfield,
Gloucestershire, called for the report to go to the Government, and for
a debate in Parliament. She said: ''We want things to change and we want
this suffering to end for the patients, their families, carers, and for
people like us.''
A decision on legal action would follow consideration of the report by
their solicitor, said Mrs Robinson.
One point to be considered, she said, was the two unlawful absences of
Andrew Robinson, who is no relation, from the Edith Morgan unit. During
the first of these, he bought the kitchen knife used to kill Ms
Robinson.
He was not searched on his return and the knife remained undiscovered
by staff before the stabbing, on September 1, 1993.
On the first occasion, he left without the knowledge of staff, due to
''lax policy''. The second time, when he was given permission by a
senior nurse, was a breach of the Mental Health Act.
Mrs Robinson said: ''They al lowed this man his freedom and, in doing
so, took away Georgina's.''
Mr Tony Boyce, trust chairman of the Edith Morgan Centre, said no
disciplinary action had been taken. Staff working under extreme stress
and pressure made judgments they felt were in the best interests of
patients, he added.
Deficiencies exposed in the trust's policies and practices could and
should have been avoided by managers and practitioners performing their
tasks properly within the existing legal framework for mental health,
said the report.
However, much of the maladministration and malpractices derived from a
''fundamentally flawed statutory framework''.
The inquiry called for an entirely new approach to the care and
treatment of the mentally disordered.
There should be a new Mental Health Act to provide a more therapeutic
framework for care, continue to control the unwarranted intervention of
doctors, yet provide more safety and security for patients, their
families, and the public.
With the development of community care, legislation should reflect the
priority of care and treatment in the community, with hospital as a
backup, said Sir Louis.
In an earlier report of a review into the area's mental health care,
commissioned by the trust -- and announced on the day of Ms Robinson's
death -- Sir Louis's team recommended the EMC should be closed.
The review described the EMC as ''reminiscent of a disused bus
station'' and ''seriously prejudicial to effective mental-health care''.
Mr Boyce said #3m funding for a new acute unit to replace the EMC had
been confirmed.
Andrew Robinson, whose parents live in Sidmouth, Devon, was sent to
Broadmoor hospital after his plea of guilty to manslaughter was accepted
by Mr Justice Drake at Truro Crown Court last March.

However, there was laughter too at the funeral in Grayson's home town

Coronation Street star Johnny Briggs, who plays wheeler-dealer Mike
Baldwin. ''Oh, stop worrying Chuck,'' volunteered stage star Dora Bryan,

THE Prime Minister issued a call to arms to the Tories yesterday, but
it came with a warning: ''No party has a divine right to govern and no
one should expect a bouncy economy alone to be sufficient for victory.''
New ideas are now the theme for Tory revival, and Mr Major called a
sudden news conference at No 10 to try to set the initiative for the
1995 political year.
He was speaking as the latest System Three opinion poll in The Herald
was indicating another stunning blow to Tory fortunes. It was also the
day United Biscuits added its name to the growing list of big companies
who are no longer contributing to Tory Party funds. The Prime Minister
has got the message and is starting urgent work now on the next General
Election with some humility.
On one issue -- Scottish devolution -- he was adamant, despite the
fact that the global opinion polls are beginning to show the country is
against him. ''The debate is only just beginning,'' he said. ''I am not
speaking out against the interests of Scotland: I believe I am speaking
out for the interests of Scotland.
''I will continue to make that point until we have won the debate and
won the argument and ditched these dangerous proposals for ever.''
Mr Major almost gave the impression he was anticipating a General
Election this year, but he is clearly striving hard to prevent one, with
a marked change of tone and strategy. ''In around two years -- a little
more, a little less -- we are going to have to persuade the public once
more to entrust us with government,'' he said. ''After 17 years no one
should be complacent about the size of that task.''
Then he abandoned his concept that the state of the economy and the
healthy recovery from recession would be enough to achieve a massive
turn-around in the nation's present opinion of him.
In two key areas of his political difficulties as far as his Commons
majority is concerned he was optimistic. In a clear message to the
Ulster Unionists who have been threatening to abandon him, he said their
fears about his negotiations with the Dublin Government are unfounded.
''There is no question of joint authorities,'' he said, adding there
was nothing secret about what he was doing. ''All our cards are face up
on the table and my palms are open.''
The Prime Minister also addressed the problem of his Euro rebels, nine
of whom are off the Tory whip and threatening the Government majority.
For the first time in public he stated that he is prepared to use
Britain's veto if necessary at next year's crucial summit on the
European Union's integration.
Decisions have to be unanimous, and, pressed on the issue, he said:
''I am not in the business of going there with heavy boots to be
difficult. But if I don't believe it is in the interests of the wider
European cause, then I will emphatically say so and I will emphatically
say 'no'. Most certainly I will veto it.''
This was a strong line to his Euro sceptics, about whom he was
optimistic.
He could not say, however, when his overall majority in the Commons
might be restored. ''I takes two to tango. The music has struck up.
We'll see who takes partners and when.''
The real point of Mr Major's Downing Street news conference -- the
first since last June after he had taken a hammering at the local
council and Euro elections -- was to seize the political initiative from
the Labour Party during its present difficulties and set the agenda for
the rest of the year.
He has instructed his Cabinet to set up policy groups for the
millennium and they are to devise new ideas for domestic and social
policies across the board for the next General Election and beyond. They
are to consult widely using ''people in all walks of life, in and
outside the Conservative Party''.
He believes that this year the economic and European debates will no
longer dominate British politics. ''There is a political life apart from
these subjects. Jobs, education, health, personal choice and
opportunity, the levels of tax, the quality of life and public services
-- these are the things that concern families.''
His views about the constitution and the royal family, which he
described as ''the central glue'' in the constitution of the UK, are
central to his crusade to re-identify the Tories with the genuine
national interest. This was despite what appeared to be a rebuke to
Prince Charles. ''I know that people expect very high standards all the
time. But I think the underlying affection remains immensely strong.''
The royal family, he said, is going through ''short term squalls.''
Labour's devolution plans run contrary to his view that the
constitution should be changed only with the greatest care and not for
political expediency. Scots who are asked if they want their own
parliament will say yes. But if they are asked if they want to pay more
tax and companies to disinvest, and to produce a UK equivalent of Quebec
in Canada, they will say no.
Political rivals were quick to react. Labour leader Tony Blair
declared: ''He had nothing new to say. He had no new initiative to
announce other than that he wanted a long- term review of policy.''
The SNP parliamentary leader, Mrs Margaret Ewing, said: ''The Prime
Minister must realise that while he may relish warm beer and cricket
grounds the Scots have already made the decision for constitutional
change.''

SIXTEEN people, more than half of them children, were feared to have
died in their beds yesterday when an avalanche smashed into a remote
Icelandic fishing village.
Five bodies were recovered soon after thousands of tonnes of snow and
ice slammed into 13 houses in the north-western village of Sudavik.
Eleven others, nine of them children, were believed to be still buried
in the snow and rubble last night. Rescue workers said their chances of
survival were remote.
The authorities said fears of avalanches prompted them to evacuate 15
houses in Sudavik, with a population of 230, four hours before the
avalanche struck, but that the evacuated houses were not hit.
Eleven people, seven of them injured, were rescued from houses. Some
of the rescued children, sleeping when the avalanche hit, were wearing
only their underwear when they were dug out of the snow in temperatures
of -7C.
A fierce storm was raging in the western part of Iceland and weather
conditions deteriorated yesterday, making the search for the missing
extremely difficult.
Rescuers, fearing more avalanches, evacuated the inhabitants of the
village to a local fishing plant and then to nearby Isafjordur.
A coastguard vessel carrying rescue equipment and doctors left
Reykjavik some 125 miles to the south in the afternoon, but was not
expected to arrive in Sudavik until today because of the storm.
Rescue teams were forced to use boats to reach the village because
roads were closed by blizzards.
A police spokesman said the entire north-western region of the country
had been declared a danger zone because of the threat of more
avalanches.

A TEENAGE mother was killed in a crash early yesterday, seconds after
police began to chase joyriders.
Miss Lea Forbes, 18, died instantly when the car in which she was
travelling hit a lamppost at high speed in Aberdeen. Three youths, also
in the Ford XR2i, were injured.
Firefighters took two hours to cut Miss Forbes, of Logie Avenue,
Aberdeen, and her three companions from the wreckage. The crash happened
at 2.35am in St Machar Drive, which was closed for five hours while
debris was cleared.
The dead woman, who has a five-month-old daughter, Savannah, was
sitting in the front passenger seat.
The accident happened seconds after the car, which had been reported
travelling at speed through Aberdeen city centre, was spotted by a
police patrol.
A police spokesman said the patrol car's blue lights were switched on
and the stolen vehicle then speeded up, turned a corner, mounted a
pavement, and hit the lamp standard.
It is understood police are considering charging at least one of the
three survivors, who are all in a stable condition at Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary. They are Lee Gajownik, 16, of Lerwick Road, John Johnstone,
16, of Barvas Walk, and James Thomson, 18, of Stewart Crescent, all
Aberdeen.
A police spokesman could not confirm which youth had been driving.
However, he had been given a breath test which had proved negative.
Miss Forbes had moved to Logie Avenue with her baby a few months ago.
Her mother stays in another part of the city.
The XR2i was reported stolen from the Ruthrieston area of Aberdeen
almost six hours before the accident.

THE first ever Scottish newspaper devoted exclusively to employment
will be available tomorrow at newsagents throughout Scotland.
Entitled Scottish Jobs, the new publication has been initiated by
Caledonian Newspapers Ltd, publishers of The Herald and Evening Times,
in conjunction with the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail.
Mr Iain Forbes, managing director of Caledonian Newspapers Ltd, said:
''It is the first newspaper in Scotland solely dedicated to Scottish
jobs and we are confident it will be well received both by advertisers
and job seekers.''
More than 1000 vacancies -- ranging from casual, unskilled and
part-time jobs to sales, retail and technical managerial positions --
will be carried in each issue.
The newspaper, which will be published every Wednesday, will have 32
tabloid pages and a cover price of 75p. It will be on sale throughout
Scotland and will include relevant editorial for the job changer and the
job seeker.
Mr John McFall, the MP for Dumbarton and Labour spokesman on
employment in Scotland, said: ''The Labour Party enthusiastically
welcomes the establishment of this new title with its sole emphasis on
jobs.
''Economic prosperity is essential for the country and individuals.
This publication will be of great assistance.''
The director of CBI Scotland, Mr Lex Gold, also endorsed the
newspaper. He said: ''CBI Scotland welcomes Scottish Jobs. It is a good
idea and one that should help to raise awareness of available jobs and
improve the working of the labour market.''

EXCLUSIVE
ONE of the most familiar names in the Scottish construction industry,
Glasgow-based terrazzo and marble specialists Toffolo Jackson, called in
the receivers yesterday.
Industry sources blamed the collapse of the 80-year-old family firm on
some main contractors in the building industry, accusing them of
squeezing sub-contractors, like this latest victim, to unsustainable
margins and then failing to pay outstanding bills on time.
''The main contractors are killing us off,'' said one source. ''For
sub-contractors in the #5m to #10m turnover range with #1m worth of
overheads there is no future any more. It's a very sick situation.''
A spokeswoman at Toffolo Jackson's head office in Burnfield Road,
Thornliebank, refused to comment. ''I hope you will wait for an official
statement,'' she said.
However, other sources confirmed that the Toffolo Jackson board, led
by Mr Randolf Laing, had asked their bankers to appoint receivers after
a period spent trying to resolve the company's increasing financial
problems.
Toffolo Jackson employs around 180 people and is involved in contracts
all over Scotland.
Before the recession hit the construction industry, the firm's
turnover was running close to #5m. Two years ago, like many other
sub-contractors, the company was badly hit by the collapse of the Lilley
construction empire.
Having traded its way out of that blow, Toffolo Jackson now becomes
the latest victim of the cut-throat climate in the building industry,
where main contractors are taking on work at slim margins, hoping to
make a profit out of arbitrated claims or by screwing down even tighter
on their sub-contractors.

A FORMER second lieutenant in the Royal Horse Artillery told a court
yesterday of the humiliating bullying and sexual abuse he suffered at
the hands of fellow officers who nicknamed him ''Ten-Inch'' because of
the size of his penis.
Alastair Green, a Scot, said that on one occasion he was strapped
naked to a ceremonial cannon and had beer and what he believed to be
urine poured over his legs before a rose from the garden was placed
between his buttocks.
In another incident, he was stripped naked in the mess bar by officers
''laughing and jeering at the size of my willy''.
''I felt they were doing this to me because I was so much younger and
inexperienced and I realised I had a lot of work to do to come up to the
grade of these very excellent officers.
''I thought they were doing it to make me somehow on a level with
them, to lift me from a 19-year-old schoolboy with two or three weeks at
Sandhurst into the regimental group.''
Mr Green's counsel, Mr Sydney Kentridge, QC, told Mr Justice
Popplewell in the High Court that the ordeal suffered by his client in
these and other incidents at Aldershot barracks in Hampshire 10 years
ago led to psychiatric breakdowns which ''altered, and in some respects
ruined, his life''.
Mr Green, now 29 and teaching English in Japan where he lives with his
Japanese wife and nine-month-old son, is suing the Ministry of Defence
and 10 named officers for damages for psychological injuries and loss of
career prospects.
In a hearing expected to last three weeks, the MoD denies that it
failed to maintain adequate discipline and the individual defendants
deny involvement in any of the alleged incidents.
The officers named by Mr Green in his claim are: Lieutenant Simon
Clegg; Captain Christopher Lang (now dead); Major William Moore; Major
Nigel Bedford; Captain Nicholas Syrett; Lieutenant Marcus Packenham (who
has not been served with the proceedings and is not represented); Major
John Murphy; Captain Marcus Bennion; Major John Buchanan and Major
Jonathan Hull, who was the regiment's medical officer.
Most of the officers held less senior ranks at the time of the alleged
incidents 10 years ago.
Mr Kentridge said some of the officers were suggesting that what
happened during Mr Green's four months' service was ''merely common
horse-play'' and that he took the incidents in good part.
''But we submit that, by whatever name they choose to call it, it was
unlawful, excessive and was the cause of, or the trigger for, his
subsequent psychosis.''
Mr Green joined the elite 7th Regiment of the RHA on a short service
limited commission in March 1985 after a rigorous selection process
including a strenuous three-week officer training course at Sandhurst
requiring enormous fitness and application, he said.
The son of an RAF wing commander, he was delighted to be posted to the
RHA, a special forces regiment and part of the airborne division in
which soldiers wore the coveted red beret.
But the ordeal he suffered forced him out of the Army with a breakdown
after only four months, and subsequent breakdowns, including attempted
suicide, over the years dashed his life-long ambition to become a
veterinary surgeon.
Mr Kentridge said there was evidence that Mr Green may have had a
genetic pre-disposition to psychotic depression. Although his father,
now retired from the RAF, had suffered no such illness, his brother --
Mr Green's uncle -- had done so at one stage in his life.
One of the questions for the court was whether the bullying caused the
onset of his illness.
Giving evidence, Mr Green, 29, said he was born in Inverness and
brought up in Scotland before attending Temple Grove preparatory school
in Sussex and then Christ's Hospital School, Horsham, Sussex.
At Christ's Hospital, he joined the combined cadet force, obtained a
gliding licence and went on a Royal Artillery parachuting course and a
sail training course on the schooner Winston Churchill.
He obtained A-levels in chemistry, biology, and physics.
Slimly built and well-spoken, he said he and other newcomers who lived
at the Aldershot officers' residential mess wore black berets and were
known as ''crap hats'' by officers who had completed para training and
wore the red beret.
He was the youngest officer by about five years.
''I acquired another nickname. It was Ten-Inch. I first became aware
of it when Nick Syrett addressed me as Ten-Inch over coffee.
''I asked him what he meant and he said it was because of my height. I
was still basically mystified, but the meaning of the nickname became
apparent as the spring wore on.
''They were referring to the size of my willy and they used to strip
me naked. It happened more than once.''
On one occasion, he said, Simon Clegg and another officer came to his
room and said they wanted him at a party. They would not let him put his
clothes on and dragged him by the legs, in his pyjamas and dressing
gown, along the corridors to the bar.
''It was frightening because the skin on my back started to burn on
the carpet,'' he said.
In the bar, Bennion and Packenham ripped his nightclothes to shreds.
''I was left naked. The other officers were laughing and jeering at
the size of my willy. I was overwhelmed. I was literally left naked in a
heap near the entrance of the bar with all these officers, who had
enjoyed their refreshments, standing around jeering at me.
''I felt like some kind of dog.''
He put on the remains of the dressing gown, had a drink which was
offered him and then ''escaped back to my room''.
Mr Kentridge said it was suggested he took this sort of thing in good
part.
Laughing nervously, Mr Green replied: ''I'm sure they took it in good
part. I tried to. When I regained my feet I would try to laugh such
things off. I wasn't somebody who would moan or whine.''
In another incident he fled in fright from his bedroom window as other
officers, obviously drunk, shouted outside and threatened to knock down
his locked door. One afternoon, after he had been with other officers to
a race meeting, he was invited by Jonathan Hull and his wife, wearing
only sheets, to join them at a ''toga party'' in the bar.
''I knew that as soon as I took my clothes off we were back into
humiliation about the size of my dick. I said no thank you, I did not
want to take part, but he did not want to leave it at that.''
Mr Green said he went to his room, undressed, put on a jock strap ''as
my last line of defence against the coming onslaught'' and put his
clothes back on. He went down to the bar because he did not want to
cower in his room.
In the bar, he was stripped naked. ''I was just so desperately
embarrassed by this sort of thing. It never happened to anybody else.''
The hearing continues.

ANIMAL rights protesters last night succeeded in turning back a lorry
loaded with sheep bound for the continent.
The lorry attempted to run the blockade of 1500 demonstrators in the
Essex port of Brightlingsea but turned back after police decided people
could be injured in the town's narrow and darkened streets.
The truck with 400 sheep aboard attempted to reach the dockside to
load its cargo aboard the Caroline, bound for Belgium then European
slaughterhouses.
Protesters sat in the road in front of the vehicle and several,
including a disabled man in a wheelchair, threw themselves under its
wheels.
The senior officer commanding the operation, Chief Inspector Peter
Sheldrake, halted the lorry's attempt to reach the dock after about five
minutes as a hail of stones pelted its cab.
The man who flung himself in front of the lorry from his wheelchair,
47-year-old Mr Chris Flood, a volunteer worker with the RSPCA in
Chelmsford, said he felt he had to make some effort to stop the
controversial shipment.
''People talk about how cruel it is to treat animals this way. They
blame everyone from Brussels to the Government, but they don't do
anything. There comes a time when you have to get off your backside and
do something,'' he said.
Mr Flood slightly injured his ribs during his dramatic gesture. Police
helped him back into his wheelchair after which the lorry began to
reverse away from the area.
As the time for the sheep to arrive came closer hundreds of people,
many with young children in their arms, joined the protest.
Mrs Maria Wilby, of Brightlingsea Against Live Exports, said: ''I hope
we've won but we will stay here until this trade is stamped out.''
A total of six people were arrested at the port yesterday.

RELATIONS between Aberdeen's top two Labour politicians have reached
rock bottom, with the city's Lord Provost contacting both his lawyer and
his union in connection with Grampian region's former convener.
Lord Provost Jim Wyness has contacted an Aberdeen lawyer and the
Educational Institute of Scotland in connection, it is understood, with
comments he believes may be attributable to Grampian Regional Council's
Labour group leader and former convener, Councillor Bob Middleton.
Both politicians are likely candidates for the vital position of
policy convener on the new Aberdeen City authority, and political
relations between them have been extremely cool for some time.
Mr Wyness is a history teacher employed by the regional council and is
a member of the EIS. Yesterday an EIS spokesman in Edinburgh confirmed
that Mr Wyness had contacted them in relation to matters concerning Mr
Middleton, but would make no comment. Mr Wyness also declined to
elaborate.
Aberdeen solicitor Frank Lefevre said he could confirm that he had
been instructed by the Lord Provost of Aberdeen ''in certain matters'',
but could say no more. Mr Middleton said: ''I don't wish to comment.''
It is understood that relations between the two men have been strained
since they were both at the head of their councils.
One insider said that they had deteriorated following the city
council's much criticised handling of the scandal over their former
chief executive, Mr Donald Macdonald who, The Herald revealed, used
bogus qualifications.

THE Game Angling Code produced by the Salmon and Trout Association
contains the enigmatic line: ''There is more to fishing than catching
fish.''
That was brought home to the anglers who braved the wind and the rain
to mark the opening yesterday of the River Tay salmon season -- not one
salmon was caught on the entire river.
It is the first time since 1947 that the salmon have been well and
truly let off the hook on the opening day, and brewers Tennent's,
sponsors of the trophy for the heaviest catch of the day, extended the
competition for 24 hours.
Some 6500 salmon were caught on the river during last year but the
high, fast-flowing, cloudy water yesterday produced the wrong conditions
to tempt the salmon to the surface.
Whether these two gentlemen fishing near the bridge at the Kenmore
Hotel will be back today is unknown. Perhaps even they, after a day in
the wind and rain, will not be appeased by the Game Angling Code:
''Accept that the blank days are part of the experience of fishing.''

A HUGE earthquake swept through central Japan yesterday, killing at
least 98 people, and injuring hundreds. Apartment buildings and a
motorway collapsed.
Police said 163 people were missing, 360 injured and hundreds trapped
in rubble in several major cities and at least 10 trains were derailed
by the tremor, which measured 7.2 on the open-ended Richter scale.
The earthquake struck the centre of Honshu Island at 5.46am, local
time, when many Japanese are starting to commute to work from outlying
suburbs.
The tremor cut across from the Pacific Ocean to the Japan Sea.
It caused damage in Osaka, the country's second-largest city, the
ancient imperial capital of Kyoto, and Japan's main western port of
Kobe.
Police said most of the dead were in the Kobe area.
At least two people died when more than 50 cars slid off the elevated
Hanshin Expressway which connects Osaka and Kobe.
Most of the people trapped were in collapsed houses in Kobe, where a
total of 33 buildings were destroyed.
They included at least four apartment buildings up to seven storeys
high.
Dozens of homes also collapsed on the island of Awajishima, about 20
miles off Kobe.
More than a dozen aftershocks rattled the area in the three hours
following the quake. Earthquake expert Megumi Mizoue, a professor at
Tokyo University, said strong and frequent aftershocks were expected to
continue for some time, adding to fire danger from broken gas mains.
The western city of Ashiya, a residential area between Kobe and Osaka,
was said to have been devastated. It was feared up to 200 people were
buried in rubble there.
Fire fighters tackled gas leaks in the three main cities and off-duty
doctors and nurses were called in to hospitals.
A resident of Nishinomiya, a town near Kobe, told Reuters she was
jolted awake in her third floor apartment.
''There was a big shaking, I felt like I was being thrown into a deep
pit like hell. It was so big. It was a terrible shaking.''
She rushed to her parents' home nearby and saw neighbours working with
their bare hands to free people trapped in a collapsed house.
''People were saying they had never seen anything like it before,''
she said.
Volunteers helped lay hoses for firefighters at a blazing building in
Kobe. Scores of stunned people stood in the streets in their pyjamas.
NHK television showed film of its Kobe office being shaken violently
by the tremor, which toppled filing cabinets and moved desks several
feet.
A major fire was raging near the centre of Kobe, and smoke billowed
over large sections of the city. NHK reported that a hospital had
collapsed in the town of Takarazuka, outside Kobe, but there was no word
on fatalities.
Television showed abandoned cars on the Hanshin Expressway which was
cut in at least three places with huge gaps in the road.
''I've never felt such a large earthquake before,'' said Takeshi
Sakamoto, head of rescue operations on Awaji Island in the Inland Sea,
where the quake was centred.
Police said about 40 homes came crashing down on Awajishima, a fishing
area which is also a popular tourist resort for residents of Kobe.
The quake was the latest of a series of significant tremors that have
rolled through northern and central Japan in the last three weeks.
Experts have been warning that a major earthquake could have been on
its way for the past few weeks.
The Cabinet was to hold an emergency meeting to discuss disaster
measures. Stock trading was suspended for the morning on the exchange in
Osaka, about 22 miles east of Kobe.
