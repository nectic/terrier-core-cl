HAVING built her multi-million pound business on traditional American
baked goods, Debra Peterson, chief executive of the Glasgow-based
California Cake and Cookie Company, is about to launch something with a
tartan taste to it. It's called The Toff's Porridge -- described as ''a
new, up-market Scottish flapjack'' made from oats and jam.
Debra got the idea from Graham Oliphant whom she met during a business
trip to the United States. Graham, speaking from his office in
Callander, said that the porridge had been made by his own granny who,
in turn, had seen it made by her granny.
Graham recalls that an old tramp, having been given some of the
porridge, returned the following day to the family's house asking for
more 'toff's porridge' and the name had stuck.
Debra's updated version will come in three flavours: Raspberry Jam,
Orange Marmalade, and a Mid-Atlantic chocolate chip.

Deedee Cuddihy celebrates the joys of breakfast and believes that
those who claim to do without it don't know what they are missing
I LOVE breakfast. I like lunch and dinner, too, but I like breakfast
best of all. In fact, if I had to choose, I'd have breakfast three times
a day and not just once.
Sometimes, when I go to bed at night, I think about what I'm going to
have for breakfast the next morning. Will I have a nice, thick slice of
Italian bread with butter and honey? Or will I have the same bread
toasted, buttered and sprinkled with a heaped teaspoonful of cinnamon
and sugar?
Or maybe I'll just have cereal.
The big fry-up is not for me, however. I'm the one who, at a hotel or
B&amp;B, places the cooked part of her compulsory full Scottish breakfast
between triangles of toast (much to the embarrassment of the rest of the
family -- but, hell, we're paying for it!), wraps it in a napkin and has
it, cold, for lunch.
The other guests, meanwhile, are tucking in with gusto to their bacon,
egg, and sausage; fried bread and tomato (or maybe even a kipper, for
God sake!), having already polished off the cereal and fruit juice.
And these are probably the same people who, in normal circumstances,
may never eat any breakfast at all.
In a recent survey carried out by the Greater Glasgow Health Board, it
was ''discovered'' that many secondary school children did just that;
and that numerous others appeared to breakfast ''inadequately or
wrongly''.
By that, the researchers probably meant that the kids were munching
chocolate bars and crisps washed down with cola on their way to the
classroom.
A lot of this concern with what children eat for breakfast stems from
research carried out in the 1950s -- by the US Cereal Institute, --
which concluded that skipping breakfast led to a loss of concentration
and impaired performance.
Some 30 years later the learned professor who had originally been
employed to interpret the findings of that research, declared that
breakfast wasn't necessary after all! ''If you don't feel like it,'' he
said, ''don't bother eating it.''
He'd been carrying out his own research into the subject and found
that doing without breakfast made no difference to the performance of a
group of 850 children.
Many people regard fruit juice as an essential ingredient of breakfast
although it's hard to believe that the enormous amount and variety of
orange juices available these days are all being consumed before
lunch-time.
I visited my nearest supermarket and bought four different types of
their own-brand orange juice: freshly squeezed (#2.19 a litre); 100%
pure squeezed ''with bits'', made from frozen Florida orange juice
(#1.79 a litre); pure juice made from Florida oranges concentrate (#1.19
a litre); and orange juice made from a concentrate which was ''the
produce of more than one country'' (47p a litre).
A taste test panel swiftly came to the conclusion that the cheaper the
juice, the lousier it tasted.
British dentists have noted, incidentally, that an increase in the
consumption of orange juice made from concentrates is leading to an
erosion of tooth enamel particularly in young children.
Although many people claim that they never eat breakfast, the fact
that #2.5 billion is spent annually in Britain on all types of cereal,
would suggest otherwise.
So what do those folk who admit to eating breakfast usually have?
Gaby Roslin, a Channel 4 Big Breakfast presenter: two slices of toast
and a cup of camomile tea. The rest of the crew have rice crispies
followed by a big fry-up made by June the tea lady.
Abeer Parkes, who's just finished a punishing nine months' stint
presenting BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland which entailed
getting up at 3.30am: ''About 10 cups of tea before and during the
programme followed by a fry-up in the canteen plus one of Queen Margaret
Drive's famous scones.''
0 George Taylor, Governor of Dumfries Young Offenders' Institute: ''I
have toast and coffee but the inmates can have cereal, toast and jam,
tea or coffee, with an optional cooked breakfast at the weekends. We
don't serve porridge these days because the prisoners don't want it.''
Colin Brown, manager of the Scotts Porage Oats plant in Cupar, Fife:
''I have two breakfasts -- bread or toast and coffee at home, then
porridge with nothing on it at work where a panel of eight tasters test
a packet of whatever's been made the day before.''
Graham, 24-year-old student at Caledonian University: ''Mars bar, salt
and vinegar square crisps, and a coke.''
Mother Prema, Hare Krishna follower: ''We get up at 3am and have
breakfast at eight, which is our main meal of the day. Usually it's
kedgeree made with dal and vegetables, puris fried in butter and herb
tea.''
George, Big Issue seller: ''My foster mother was always on at me to
eat breakfast when I was a kid but I never feel like eating until
midday. If I've made enough money, I have a couple of 'doublers' -- two
buttered rolls with a sausage and fried egg in each. Beautiful.''

* MARGARET THATCHER employed a handbag. But if you are a woman with
leadership problems, pyscho-geometrics offers a more subtle approach.
It's one of the skills being paraded at seminars across Scotland next
month, and during August. Translated P-G is a way of analysing people's
strengths and weaknesses, to your own advantage.
According to CareerTrack, getting to the top is only the first hurdle
for female high-flyers. Once there, they face entrenched attitudes from
both male and female staff, who resent taking orders from a woman, or
reckon she's a pushover.
A highpowered one-day CareerTrack course aims to equip women managers
and supervisors with techniques that win respect and motivate others.
With a money-back guarantee, the sessions are being staged at Aberdeen,
Dundee, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow, and Kilmarnock. To enrol, and for
further details, phone 01908 354 000.
* IF it's tough at the top, it can be murder at the bottom. A
marketing assistant who opens mail at an Edinburgh investment company
has written to Investors Chronicle this month revealing how aggrieved
recipients of junk mail are hitting back: deposits enclosed in one
reply-paid envelope weren't the welcome monetary kind, but the human
sort on toilet paper.
The distraught young woman, who condemns this and other ''nasties''
she has encountered, could find a Royal Mail guide useful reading. It
explains what to do about obscene, indecent and offensive material. It's
also a handy reference book for the law-abiding customer, listing the
things that can and can't be sent by post.
Bees, leaches, lugworms, maggots, and parasites can be accepted;
Christmas crackers, however, are listed under ''explosives'' -- so will
you have a visit from Special Branch if you send some to the
grandchildren this year? Pick up a free copy of Prohibited And
Restricted Goods at your local post office or customer service centre to
find out.
* WHILE experts disagree how much traffic pollution is to blame for
the rising number of asthma victims, there is little argument about the
role of the dust mite. Just as the rat population is exploding outdoors
with the detritus of modern society, the 90s penchant for central
heating, double glazing and soft furnishings provides a happy breeding
ground for the mite -- as many as two million thrive in the average
double bed size mattress, feeding off dead skin cells.
It's not the microscopic organism itself that's the problem, but an
enzyme in its droppings which provokes asthma attacks and triggers
rhinitis, eczema and other allergies. Daltex Allershield barrier bedding
combats the problem by creating a barrier between the mite and human
occupants of the bed. The lightweight, non-toxic fabric is washable and
comes in handy packs including pillow and duvet covers, and a mattress
sheet to fit cots, single, double, or kingsize beds. Available from high
street stores and selected chemists.
* WHILE stripping the bed, give the electric blanket a thorough check.
Many people forget all about them, but according to Which? magazine that
could be fatal.
Research shows you're more likely to be a victim of an electrical
accident in bed than in the bathroom. When Which? tested electric
blankets it found one in three had potentially deadly faults.
Summer is the ideal time to take blankets to a qualified electrician
for inspection. But disasters can strike anywhere in the home and the
Which? Guide To Home Safety And Security is a defence manual in avoiding
them. It also explains how to carry out a detailed security survey,
provide a safe environment for the young and very old, vet callers and

* THE Royal Museum of Scotland is extending its open hours on Tuesday
evenings from June 13. The museum -- which normally closes at 5pm --
will stay open until 8pm every Tuesday until August 29. During this
year's Edinburgh International Festival the museum will also open until
8pm on three consecutive Saturdays from August 19 in response to public
demand, offering visitors an opportunity to see the treasures on display
during the early evening and enjoy other facilities, including the
tearoom and museum shop.

Elizabeth Westcott explains why the chips are down in everything but
price for
take-away customers
IT'S a mild, clear evening, so why not grab a curry and have dinner
outdoors, stretched out on the lawns of your local park? No time wasted
in preparing food and cooking, no washing-up, plus the chance to enjoy
summer ambience with an instant picnic -- even on a working day. Bliss.
Except for one distinctly non-blissful factor. The price.
The Glaswegian tradition of ''carry oot'' is under threat, with the
rising prices of takeaway food making it a luxury spectrum, two humble
fish suppers will typically cost the best part of a fiver, while Chinese
or Indian meals for a family of four will cost well in excess of #20.
Carry out offers convenience, but it is no longer a cheap alternative.
Indian food emerged as the most expensive in a recent survey of
Glaswegian carry-out restaurants, but this was not always the case.
According to Jimshaed Sharif, proprietor of Babu Ji, an Indian
delicatessen and takeaway in Glasgow's West End, a curry was once much
cheaper than Italian or Chinese carry-out. He believes the dramatic
price rise over the past five years or so can be attributed to the
increasing consumer demand for quality.
''Consumers are more aware of what they are getting,'' he said. ''Once
Indian food was the cheapest, but not now. The market is equalising.
Also, some Indian carry-out was cuisine created for the Glasgow palate
-- people were being exploited through their ignorance as to what Indian
food was.''
These days, Sharif continued, a more educated public crave the
authentic taste of Indian food as it should be prepared; and that costs
money. At Babu-Ji's an adult-sized portion of curry will cost you #4,
with rice #1 and nan bread between 65 and 75 pence.
''For me, quality comes first, then price,'' he said. ''Our prices are
not sky-high, but they are relatively high; that's because I have
intelligent staff trained by me personally -- I could get much cheaper
staff if I wanted. Also, for meat dishes I make sure I have the best
lamb, the best chicken. I pick and choose the best vegetables from
Safeway across the road -- it's more expensive, but the end result
reflects the care you put into it.
''Using the best ingredients and no preservatives, you end up with a
completely different product -- in the end you get what you pay for.''
However the spokesperson for Consumer and Trading Standards, Glasgow
says that high prices do not necessarily guarantee quality. There have
been a number of cases of meat substitution in Glasgow, where wily
fast-food proprietors have drenched cheap cuts of meat in spices then
charged extra for beef. He went on to say that far from being demanding,
people are essentially creatures of habit.
''Our experience is that carry-outs build up a reputation and then
trade off that,'' he said. ''It might be high quality at first but even
if it goes downhill people will still go there because they are used to
it.''
With prices as they are, people can no longer enjoy carry-out on a
weekly basis unless they budget for it specifically, according to a
spokesperson for Citizen's Advice, Scotland.
''Carry-out meals are less value for money than they used to be -- and
the tax the Conservatives put on carry-out hasn't helped,'' he said.
''Once you could feed a family on fish suppers -- now you're talking #20
for Chinese, which is very prohibitive. You might as well go out for
that sort of money. I think the only reason people get carry-out now is
because of the convenience.''
Carry-out does offer more than the meal itself; included in the price
is the time and energy you are saved by not having to cook. For
full-time workers who can't face making dinner at the end of a hectic
day it's worth a few extra pounds, but many still find it difficult to
justify the expense.
Certainly Lyn Regan, who is married with three children and a weekly
income she describes as ''average to low'', considers carry-out to be an
indulgence she can't really afford.
''I absolutely love getting takeaways. It gives me a real break. I
usually get fish and chips, pizzas or sometimes kebabs because they're
all cheaper, but I can't get them as often as I'd like. They're not
healthy and the expense builds up,'' she said. ''Other types, like
Chinese, are definitely a luxury -- I could spread that money over three
home-cooked dinners!''
Mr Fugaccia, proprietor of The Merry Fryer in Glasgow, says that 20
years in the fish-and-chip business has taught him that price is
secondary to quality when it comes to marketing carry-out meals.
''It's a combination of food quality, price, and good service,'' he
said. ''Also, the level of cleanliness in the shop itself is important
in the impression it leaves on the customer.
''Our fish supper is #2.60 and our pizzas range from #2.20 to #4.50,
which I think is reasonably priced. We could do a cheaper fish supper
using inferior fish, but my rule is I won't sell anything I wouldn't eat
myself.''
The cost of fish and chips may fluctuate according to the price of
potatoes, and many chip shops have been forced to raise their prices due
to competition from more glamorous types of carry-out. At the end of the
day, however, it remains the cheapest carry-out available, as the survey
demonstrates.
''It's good value for money -- a filling, well-balanced meal,'' said
Fugaccia. ''You could spend #7 or #8 at Burger King or McDonald's and
feel hungry half an hour later. Fish and chips are still the number one
takeaway.''
When it comes to the crux of the matter, carry-out restaurants, like
any retailers, will judge the market and charge for their products
accordingly. As the Consumer and Trading Standards spokesperson points
out, there are no limits set on the prices of takeaway meals: ''The only
requirement is that they display the price. Otherwise they can charge
whatever they think they can get away with.''

SCOTTISH business was the recipient of a generous amount of investment
from 3i, the recently floated investment capital group, in the year to
March. Some #45m was invested in 66 local companies taking 3i's Scottish
portfolio to 286 companies, valued at #242m, which represents a rise in
value of 15% on last year.
In contrast to many other parts of the group, 3i's Glasgow office saw
continued demand for growth capital. Investments in this sector included
California Cake and Cookie, Kimbell and Polton House Press. Willie Watt,
director of 3i in Glasgow said he was delighted with the year's results
and drew attention to some significant portfolio sales in the year which
included Meconic and Exacta Circuits.
Business has got off to a good start in the first quarter of the
current financial year with 3i's Glasgow office investing in a number of
companies. These include Scotsafe, Lithgow Electronics and Deveron
Environmental.
3i as a whole performed well last year with its fully diluted nav
increasing by 10.5% to 346p. This compares with 3i's price in the market
yesterday of 367p, down 5p. The company was floated at 272p last July
and has 55,000 investors although several of its major shareholding
banks have indicated their desire to sell their stakes. However chief
executive Ewen Macpherson said this was not a surprise because an
investment trust was ''not a natural holding'' for a bank.
Shareholders' funds rose by around 11% to #2049m. Its total return of
#239m represented a return of 12.9% on opening shareholders' funds. This
compares with the FTSE All-Share return of just 2.8% in the period and
7.2% decline in the FTSE SmallCap index.
Investment advanced to #440m from #357m with lots of management
buy-out and emerging business activity. 3i increased its share of the
venture capital market, helped by its network of regional UK offices.
There was also growth in the Continental European business particularly
in Germany and Spain. The balance sheet strengthened in the year, helped
by the #77m realised capital profits. There is a final dividend of 4.4p
making a total shareholders' payment for the year of 7.2p, an increase
of 10.1%.
3i is in a strong position to build on last year's good results.
However Mr Macpherson noted that although business confidence remains
positive, the 3i Enterprise Barometer shows that many businesses now
believe there has been a marked slowdown in the pace of improvement in
the general economic climate.

SCOTTISH housebuilder CALA said yesterday that house sales were
running slightly below expectations, but this year's profits would be
boosted by windfall gains on a multi-million pound land sale.
The Edinburgh-based company said the net effect would be an increase
of up to #1m in pre-tax profits for the year ending June 30.
CALA made a half-year profit of #2m on turnover of #33.9m and analysts
had been looking to a full-year profit of up to #6m before the latest
announcement.
Finance director Robert Dick said the housing market had remained
tough during the spring and CALA had lowered its expectations slightly.
The company would also write off land options more heavily than it has
done in the past, he added.
But Mr Dick said CALA was not issuing a profits warning. ''Given the
size of the land transaction, we felt we should be making an
announcement,'' he said.
Mr Dick refused to give details about CALA's land sale, but he said it
was worth several million pounds.
CALA house sales should rise to about 700 units this year from 576 in
1993/94, with growth in Scotland compensating for a soft English market.
But Mr Dick said: ''We are talking about 20 to 25 units short of
market expectations.''
Results will also be hit by a larger write-off of land options than in
previous years, partly because CALA is paying out higher front-end
premiums on potential building land than it had done previously.
Mr Dick stressed this would not amount to a significant increase in
book losses. ''We are not talking telephone numbers,'' he said.
CALA wrote off #500,000 of land options at the end of the last
financial year and had #1.2m of options on its book at the end of
December. Its shares were unchanged at 120p.

SOUTH Yorkshire Pensions Authority has appointed Murray Johnstone
Private Equity (MJPE) as managers of its #40m unquoted investments
portfolio.
The subsidiary of Glasgow fund managers Murray Johnstone said this
deal brings the amount of venture capital under its management to about
#300m.
''It will certainly make us one of the largest players in the regional
market,'' said David McLellan, managing director of MJPE.
Murray Johnstone has been an active investor in unquoted companies
based in Yorkshire for the last eight years and Mr McLellan said it
planned to open a new office in the area shortly, probably in Sheffield
or Barnsley.
Murray Johnstone said South Yorkshire Pensions Authority had more than
#40m invested in unquoted companies and trusts and planned to invest a
further #10m in this area over the next two years.
The company made new investments of over #50m in 31 unquoted UK
companies last year and plans to launch a venture capital trust later
this year once the necessary regulations have been approved.
Venture capital trusts will act in much the same way as ordinary unit
trusts, investing shareholder funds in a wide range of small businesses
that need fresh capital to expand.
But, unlike ordinary unit trusts, they will enjoy generous tax breaks,
similar to those offered by Business Expansion Schemes.

<RECORDNO>977977497</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LAWYER was awarded #90 damages yesterday in his legal battle with
Scrabble experts over a visit to the toilet.
The figure was short of the #5000 Mr Mike Goldman had sought, and
Judge Anthony Hallgarten said: ''I think this is the lowest award I have
ever made.''
Mr Goldman, a father-of-two, said later: ''I am very relieved.''
Mr Goldman, 62, a former Scrabble champion, had argued during the
three-day case at Central London County Court that going to the toilet
had cost him the chance of first place in a tournament and #200 in prize
money.
The judge told the court he agreed -- to an extent. However, he made
it clear that he regarded it as ''lamentable'' that the case should have
gone so far.
''I have to say I am deeply sorry that this case, attended by 46 pages
of pleadings, 51 pages of witness statements, and over 200 pages of
documentation, ever came to court.''
However, after legal submissions, the judge said that, despite his
views, he would grant Mr Goldman some of his costs.
The precise amount to be paid by the three Association of Premier
Scrabble Players officials he sued -- estimated by Mr Goldman at no more
than #2000 to #3000 of a #10,000 legal bill -- is yet to be assessed by
court officials.
Those he vanquished -- APSP president Allan Simmons, chairman Graeme
Thomas, and former secretary Clive Spate -- also have to meet their own
legal costs, understood to be around #15,000.
They will be helped by a fighting fund set up for them by the
association.
In his evidence, Mr Goldman, of Maida Vale, west London, told the
court he been among 90 players taking part in a weekend tournament at
the Burstin Hotel, Folkestone, in December 1990.
He had to go to the toilet after the second of three 50-minute games
during the Saturday morning session.
When he returned to his seat, he found he had missed four minutes play
because a timing clock had been started. His opponent had already scored
76 points.
He lost the game and was placed fourth in the tournament which he
insisted he would otherwise have won.
Mr Goldman argued that the three association officials -- who had all
denied liability -- had breached a contractual duty to apply the rules
''fairly, reasonably, and properly''.
In his ruling, the judge said he was satisfied organisers had made it
clear before the tournament that clocks could be started in a player's
absence and there would be no leniency.
However, those responsible for staging the event had made no mention
or given any indication that breaks would be allowed between rounds for
those ''wishing to relieve themselves or take refreshment''.
The judge said it would also be ''quite unfair'' to expect players to
have an ''invidious choice'' between grinning and bearing it or going to
the toilet and possibly missing the start of a game.
Mr Goldman said after the case: ''It was the principle. It was my
right to bring this action.''
A spokesman for the Association of Premier Scrabble Players said the
court action was ''totally out of proportion to the incident''.

THE outlook for the pricing of the NYNEX Cablecomms share sale
improved as a result of the valuation placed on SBC CableComms (UK) by
TeleWest Communications.
The latter is to merge with SBC in a deal which values SBC at #679m,
and the valuation suggests that NYNEX could be priced towards the higher
end of its previously disclosed range of 131p to 151p.
The TeleWest/SBC merger will create the largest UK cable operator,
with interests in 31 franchises covering some 4,100,000 homes.
TeleWest was set up by the American groups US West and
Tele-Communications and a minority of the shares were sold to the public
when the company was floated on the stock market in November.
Now shareholders will be offered one share in the merged company for
each TeleWest share currently held, though it will be September before
the deal is completed.

A LACK of affordable housing can prove a real drawback to economic
development in rural areas of Scotland, a major study commissioned by
Scottish Homes and Highlands and Islands Enterprise has shown.
However, just increasing the number of houses is only part of the
solution. The report says there must be increased economic activity in
rural communities to stimulate more wealth and, in turn, to encourage
private sector housebuilders to invest in developments.
The solutions proposed include the need for a strong local housing
market which would sustain healthy local building trade businesses
carrying out repairs and improvement work. This would help encourage the
development of local businesses and trades skills.
Mr Ken MacTaggart, director of strategy for HIE, said his agency
needed to encourage private-sector housebuilders to play a more active
role and to do that it needed to increase prosperity in communities by
generating greater economic activity.

LACK-lustre industrial production figures, showing an expected fall in
output in April, have provided the latest indication of a slowdown in
economic activity.
In the City the data were widely interpreted as justification of the
decision by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, to block
Bank of England pressure for a hike in rates. The need for a tighter
monetary policy is now thought to have become a question of later rather
than sooner.
Both industrial production and its manufacturing component fell by
0.2% in April following two months of rising output. The year-on-year
growth in industrial production retreated sharply from March's 5% to
2.7%. Manufacturing growth fell back from 3.9% to 2.3%.
Output of the electricity, gas, and water industries declined in
April, mining and quarrying, which includes North Sea oil and gas
extraction, was unchanged, and the main element in manufacturing's
weakness was a 7.8% fall in coke, refined fuels, and nuclear fuels,
which had moved ahead smartly in April. Core sectors, such as metals and
engineering, increased output against the norm.
However, the trend in output is clearly upwards, albeit at a slower
pace than that indicated by CBI survey evidence. In the latest three
months manufacturing output was 0.6% higher and 3.1% above the level of
the same three months a year ago. The comparable figures for industrial
production were 0.9% and 3.7%.
Most sectors grew in the three months to April, with the strongest
gains being 1% in chemicals and 0.7% in engineering. The only
significant fall was textiles, down 0.4%.
The sector breakdown shows the bigggest increase, 1.2%, was in
investment goods. Consumer goods were 0.8% higher and intermediate goods
0.7%.
The weakness of the official manufacturing figures relative to CBI
surveys continues to puzzle the pundits.
James Capel's Adam Cole said, ''The CBI survey suggests trend growth
of at least double what is currently recorded by the CSO.
''Our interpretation remains that this is probably a timing issue,
possibly related to stockbuilding, and the strength of output suggested
by the CBI survey will be reflected in the official data over the coming
months.''

THE entire Scotland squad and management spent the afternoon in the
Eersterust township on the outskirts of Pretoria yesterday.
About 250 youngsters, ranging in age from six to 16, gathered to meet
the Scottish party and they were put through their paces as each member
of the squad supervised groups of youngsters in drill sessions.
The township boasts a fledgling rugby set-up, receiving assistance in
cash and kind from the Northern Transvaal Rugby Union.
The township kids have been watching the World Cup on television and
were thrilled to see the Scotland stars in the flesh.
Normally, Scotland captain Gavin Hastings is the centre of attraction
but, on this occasion, Eric Peters (pictured above) stole the show.

SCOTLAND will stick by the side which lost so devastatingly in the
dying seconds against France for their crucial RWC quarter-final tie
against New Zealand on Sunday.
Peter Wright and Graham Shiel, casualties from Loftus Versfeld last
weekend, with damaged ribs and nose respectively, are declared fit to
play.
Shiel will resume his starting centre partnership with Scott Hastings,
the midfield being virtually the only area where the selectors might
have played the options game with Tony Stanger and Ian Jardine raring to
go.
If fit, Shiel was always going to be one of the first names on the
team-sheet with the experience of the younger Hastings -- who will be
winning his fifty-seventh cap -- tipping the scales in his favour vis a
vis Stanger and Jardine.
Craig Joiner, on the left wing, retains the selectors' confidence, the
feeling being that his defence has improved as he has gained in
international maturity. Nevertheless, the prospect of the still
relatively inexperienced wing man squaring up to the supercharged
dump-truck power of Jonah Lomu is one which might have seen the
selection of Stanger on the flank, and this in spite of the Hawick man's
wish to forego the wing for the midfield.
The All Black team was also announced yesterday and, with the
injury-induced absence of Glen Osborne -- Jeff Williams will come in at
full-back -- and Richard Loe at loose-head prop in place of sore-throat
victim Craig Dowd, it is an advantage (however slight) to Scotland on
the basis that they, at least, have had a squad of 26 to choose from.
Manager Duncan Paterson, indeed, said yesterday: ''It is an
interesting statistic that all 26 of our players have been available for
all three games and I don't think any other side has been able to say
that.
''There has been a bit of luck involved but I think it speaks volumes
for the fitness of the squad.
''We said to the players that we can only pick fifteen and it is
sometimes very difficult for those that are left out. But they have been
absolutely magnificent in supporting the first XV.''
Paterson said that the chosen XV should have beaten France last
weekend and the players knew that.
''There has been no need for us to drum that into them. They have
drummed it into themselves. They know that they should have beaten
France and they are very disappointed.''
One area where the Scots will have to improve is in the use made of
possession. This was a point acknowledged by Paterson, who said: ''We
just have to make better use of ball than we did last weekend.''
New Zealand will be a tougher assignment than France, said the
manager. They are, historically, the No.1 side in the world, whereas
France are less consistent.
The New Zealand coach, Laurie Mains, said yesterday that the omission
of Osborne with an ankle injury did not upset their plans in any way.
''Jeff has had about six games at full back and it is his first-choice
position. That does not cause us any problems at all. He is safe under
the high ball and, in some senses, at full back, he has a wider range of
options than he does on the wing.''
The selection of Josh Kronfeld in the back-row, ahead of longer
established players, indicates that the scrum-cap bedecked flanker, who
had only one Test appearance to his name when he left New Zealand for
South Africa, has arrived on the world scene.
Lomu switched wings between the All Blacks' games against Ireland and
Wales, playing on the left flank against the Irish and on the right
against Wales. Perhaps in an effort to keep Scotland guessing, Mains
said that Lomu might yet be switched against Scotland.
All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick, acknowledging that the
quarter-final was a real do-or-die situation, declared that Scotland
represented a huge mountain for the Kiwis to climb.
''Every team that we play delivers the game of their lives against us
and Scotland will be no different. They are highly motivated and I
expect a tough old contest.''
* SCOTLAND have made only one change to the team that defeated
Zimbabwe 39-23 last Saturday in Bulawayo for the second Test tomorrow at
the Police Ground in Harare.
Hawick's Derek Turnbull, who was called in to the tour party last
weekend, comes in for the injured Fergus Wallace at blind-side flanker.
Team:
R Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals); H Gilmour (Heriots), S Nichol
(Selkirk), R Eriksson (London Scottish), D Stark (Boroughmuir); S Laing
(Instonians), J Burns (Stewart's Melville FP); A Watt (GHK), M Scott
(Orrel), S Paul (Heriots), I Elliot (Hawick), R Scott (London Scottish),
D Turnbull (Hawick), S Reid (Boroughmuir) captain, G Dall (Heriots).
Replacements -- M Dods (Gala), D Hodge (Watsonians), K Troup (Edinburgh
Academicals), G Flockhart (Stirling County), M Browne (Melrose), J Hay
(Hawick).

CAPTAIN R I Wainwright spends his working days tending to the sick and
infirm in the the army garrison at Catterick.
The military medic spends his leisure time playing rugby to
spectacularly significant effect for West Hartlepool and Scotland.
With Gavin Hastings on the verge of international retirement, Captain
Rob is the leading contender -- some would say the only contender -- to
assume the Hastings mantle.
Here in South Africa, the peerless Hastings aside, Wainwright, who
wins only his seventeenth cap against New Zealand on Sunday, has been
the pick of the pack and, in almost every respect, the driving force
behind some highly satisfying performances by the Scottish eight.
The captaincy, and his perceived role as the heir-apparent, is a
subject about which he will not talk.
Articulate, deceptively languid and, every inch of his 6ft 5in frame,
a gent of the old school, he says only: ''That is something about which
I'd prefer not to comment.''
On virtually every other subject, though, the Glenalmond old boy and
double Cambridge Blue -- boxing and rugby -- is a persuasive and
enticing communicator.
He won his first cap as a replacement against Ireland in 1992 at a
time when he had, not long beforehand, all but given up hope of catching
the selectorial eye.
''The most important figure to me, in terms of the development of my
rugby, was Finlay Calder. When I was 24 or 25 I was depressed by my lack
of progress and I was in Hong Kong for the Sevens with Finlay. He told
me that he got his first cap at the age of 29 and it was really just a
matter of persevering. That was a huge help to me and events since have
shown that perseverence does pay off.
''If you are not in the Scotland set-up at 25 then all is not lost. If
you persevere and set yourself a long-term goal then quite often it will
work out for you.''
Wainwright has probably missed nine or 10 caps through injury --
Achilles and hamstring problems now having cleared up -- the most recent
injury problems being the severe facial fracture sustained during his
try-scoring performance against England last year and the dodgy
hamstrings which prevented him captaining Scotland to Argentina last
summer. The cure, incidentally, was affected by means of homeopathic
injections administered by Bayern Munich team doctor Hans Muller
Wohlfahrt.
If he is appointed captain, post Hastings, then Wainwright will likely
fulfil the role for the next four years.
''Injuries willing, I can see myself going on until the next World
Cup. But that will depend upon how fresh I feel and whether my family
(he and Romayne have a 10-month son, Douglas) can put up with the
absences that have become part of an international player's life.
''Most people who retire do so nowadays not because of the number of
games that they play but because they can no longer make the commitment
to training and preparation and so on.''
That grinding commitment is one of the factors which is driving the
game inexorably towards professionalism but here, too, Wainwright holds
to almost Corinthian principles which run counter to the pro orthodoxy
which afflicts the top players.
''I'm lucky in that I have a very understanding employer in the Army.
To be honest, I can't see rugby in Scotland going professional. A
semi-professional situation might develop but there just isn't the money
in the Scottish club game to support fully professional players.
''I can see a situation where the players get very well remunerated as
compensation for the time off work to prepare for international rugby,
but I'm not in favour of a fully professional game.''
Articulatating a viewpoint which amounts to a virtual heresy among
many top-class players, Wainwright adds: ''As soon as you have a
professional game, and I think this would also be a problem with
semi-professionalism too, then someone has control over you.
''If you were paid by a club then you would have to do what they tell
you and you might find yourself in a position whereby you are doing
things that you don't want to do merely because someone pays you and,
therefore, has control over you.''
But his concerns go deeper than the erosion of personal freedom:
''There are other problems that will come as a result of a professional
game and the likelihood of a win bonus is one of them. If that comes in
then the winning will become more important than the playing. I don't
think that would be a good thing for the game at all.''
Lest it be thought that he isn't a winner by nature and instinct, he
adds: ''Of course, winning for Scotland in a tournament like this is
all-important, but if horrendous fouls are going to occur because of the
pressure on players to win then that can't be good for the game.
''There's the danger, too, that the game will become boring because
many will see the best way to win is to stick up up-and-unders again and
again and that isn't going to be a good thing for rugby.
''Don't get me wrong. The will to win is paramount for us out here
just now but I think it would be very sad if, for instance, the
Barbarians and all they stand for, were to disappear and one wonders
what part a club like that would have to play in a professional game.''
A Corinthian then? Wainwright says not. ''I don't think that's the
case at all because, especially so far as Scotland are concerned, I work
very hard at my game and want to see everyone in the Scottish set-up
working just as hard.
''I want to see Scotland one of the top rugby nations in the world
instead of languishing at around sixth. We can do a lot better than
that.''
Wainwright is now intensely focused on the up-coming encounter against
the All Blacks. He thinks that Scotland can win. Of course, he would say
that, wouldn't he. But he is such an analytical beast -- a trait, no
doubt, distilled by years of medical training -- that there is a
singularly persuasive quality to his point of view.
''The more times that I watch the videos the more I think that they
are beatable. They're a clinical side. They don't do anything
particularly special but what they do, they do quite well.
''However, if you play a slightly unorthodox game then I think they're
vulnerable. If you just play regulation and four-man lineouts, kicking
in your own half, and up-and-unders then they're geared to defending
that well so we're probably going to have to look at different
options.''

SCOTTISH Radio Holdings, which operates Radio Clyde, said last night
that it was in talks with the board of West Sound Radio which could lead
to a bid for Ayr-based station Westsound.
The announcement came after the market closed.
Last month, Scottish Radio announced a 25% rise in pre-tax profits to
#2.5m for the six months to March 31, on turnover up 15% to #8.5m.
It achieved these results because of a 50% increase in national
broadcast revenue booked through its group sales house in London. This
compensated for a 1% fall in revenue generated locally in Scotland.
Besides Radio Clyde, Scottish Radio also owns Edinburgh-based Radio
Forth, Radio Tay in Dundee, and Northsound in Aberdeen.
James Gordon, a pioneer of independent radio in Scotland, will step
down as chief executive of Scottish Radio next year when he is 60,
retaining a role as a non-executive chairman.

SHAREHOLDERS of plant-hire giant Hewden Stuart yesterday turned out in
their droves to pay tribute to retiring executive chairman Sir Matthew
Goodwin at a packed annual meeting in Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall.
JCB chairman Sir Anthony Bamford said without Hewden Stuart, which has
been its dealer-principal for the last 23 years, JCB may not have become
the household name it is today.
Sir Anthony told Sir Matthew: ''There is little doubt that JCB as a
company has consolidated and enhanced its position in the UK market
through our partnership with your company.''
Sandy Findlay, Sir Matthew's lieutenant since 1969, yesterday took
over as executive chairman.
Mr Findlay believes Glasgow-based Hewden Stuart, the largest
plant-hire company in the UK, Europe and possibly the world, has plenty
of room for further growth.
In pursuit of its strategy of increasing its presence in the south of
England, Hewden Stuart is currently looking at two ''quite interesting''
acquisition opportunities.
Mr Findlay said: ''We only account for about 12% of the UK market. We
could potentially double the size of the business in the UK, without
going abroad.
''We will almost certainly get involved in acquisitions -- whether
they are bolt-on or significant -- during the remainder of this year.''
Sir Matthew, who received a standing ovation from the 150-strong
audience, more than double the normal turnout at Hewden Stuart's annual
meetings, said his 33 years in the plant-hire business had been exciting
and interesting.
His decision to relinquish the chairmanship, he added, had not been an
easy one. However, he had every confidence in the board's ability to
take the group forward.
True to form, Sir Matthew, whose bold decision to invest heavily
during the last recession paid dividends, criticised others in the
industry for attaching too much importance to short-term profits, at the
expense of investment.
In the year to end-January, Hewden Stuart's pre-tax profits leapt 82%
to #34.8m, on turnover of #260m.
Shareholders approved an increase in the company's authorised share
capital from #27.5m to #35m, to facilitate a free scrip issue of one new
share for every five held.

AT&amp;T Europe has teamed up with Graham Technology to promote the
Hillington-based company's workflow program.
This is the first time that AT&amp;T -- which has annual revenue of around
#50bn from its global communications networks -- has gone outside its
Bell Laboratories subsidiary's research capabilities for computer
software and so represents a resounding success for GT founder Iain
Graham, and marks the growing reputation of Scottish expertise in
mathematical sciences.
Now named Callflow, the system was originally developed in 1991 and
was taken on commercially by the GUS mail-order giant which bought 200
screens in October last year.
It has since advanced so that users are presented with a series of
prompts and multiple questions. A typical sequence would be for a
customer buying one item from a catalogue being offered other goods at
the same time with the operator having details of past purchasing
patterns. This could allow discounts to be worked out instantaneously
according to order size.
The range of applications is huge and would seem to have a major
potential in banks and supermarkets while giving access to the Internet.
With the fire-power of AT&amp;T begin it, GT is developing spin-offs. But
it reckons that it is two years ahead of the competition. The company
employs about 40 people of whom two thirds are graduates.
Little is being revealed about profitability, which has been depressed
by the costs of Callflow's development, but it is now set to grow
''exponentially.''
It seems unlikely that it will aiming for flotation for quite some
considerable time.

<HEADLINE>Market newcomer needs 20,000 tonnes a year.  Meconic to cover UK in fields of daffodils</HEADLINE>

THE face of Britain seems set to turn a slight shade of yellow over
the next five years as the plans of drugs manufacturer Meconic develop.
It is contract manufacturing the vital component galanthamine where
testing has reached the crucial phase three stage for the control of
Alzheimer's disease.
This substance is derived from daffodil bulbs.
At present Britain produces 9000 tonnes out of a world total of 11,000
tonnes.
But Meconic which is the parent company of Edinburgh based Macfarlan
Smith will need 20,000 tonnes a year -- it requires 10,000 tonnes of
bulbs to produce just one kilogram of galanthamine for discoverers Shire
Pharmaceuticals -- and so British production, chiefly in Lincolnshire,
will more than treble as contract farmers are recruited.
Investigations are under way to find sites in Scotland suitable for
growing daffodils on such a huge scale -- and perhaps a commercial use
will have to be found for the flowers that will be produced in enormous
quantities as the cut flower trade will not be able to cope with the
increased supply.
Galanthamine was originally discovered in snowdrops but the hardier
and larger daffodil is a much more commercial product.
There is similar agriculture in Turkey and Tasmania where poppies are
grown to provide the opiates which are the core Macfarlan Smith business
which originated in Edinburgh in 1780. The Tasmanian poppies are grown
by Glaxo which sold off Macfarlan Smith to a management buyout in 1990
led by managing director Marshall Smalley.
Mr Smalley is very happy with the margins that will come from
commercial production of the Alzheimer drug.
Meconic is valued in the placing at #44.4m with the shares priced at
135p. Public interest, particularly in Scotland, has been strong and
stock has been allocated to clients of certain brokers including Bell,
Lawrie White, Allied Provincial and Torrie &amp; Co ahead of first dealings
on June 16.
Codeine is the largest product by volume but is low margin. Controlled
pain killers include morphine, diamorphine (heroin) and cocaine.
Non-pharmaceutical activities which account for a sixth of sales are led
by Bitrex which is the bittering agent put into household cleaners to
prevent swallowing.
Some #18.7m is being raised of which #10m is new money for the company
and #8.7m from existing shareholders including 3i which will retain a
long term 17.7% stake. Some 143 of the 200 staff have taken the
opportunity to be allocated shares, some at a preferential price of
122p.
The new money will be used in doubling capital spending and ''picking
up the crumbs from the rich men's table'' as the pharmaceutical giants
sell off their none-core activities.
Estimated profits in the year to April amounted to #4.2m on turnover
of #29.6m. So the shares are priced at 14.5 times earnings against an
average multiple of about 16 for the five nearest competitors with an
indicated 4.1% yield.
Profits for the current year seem likely to improve to about #5.1m for
a p/e of under 13.
On the existing portfolio, Meconic is good value but the interest lies
in the new products which should come on stream over the next few years
including pain killers derived from Mexican chillies.

MIKE Umaga, of GHK and Western Samoa -- the full back had two seasons
at Old Anniesland in 1991 and '92 -- has every right to be happy with
the way things have gone for his team so far in the tournament.
Beaten only by England in their pool, this weekend the Western Samoans
line up for a game against the local heroes, the South Africans, and a
win at the expense of Francois Pienaar's men would go down as one of the
shock results of all time.
''Listen, we toured here before the competition, did badly, and we
accept that,'' he said. ''But it has been great shoving it down the
throats of the South Africans who had written us off as no-hopers,
because we knew that we were coming here to acclimatise and learn, and
in the learning process we lost. But we have learned.''
As to his team's chances, Umaga thinks that Western Samoa can provide
an upset. ''I genuinely believe that we know more about the game than
they do as far as technique goes. Scotland does, too.'' he says, with a
hint of steel in his voice. ''We're here now and we are going to make
the best of it against them. I wouldn't like to be a South African this
weekend.''
And no wonder. Of all the Samoan attributes, the one that stands out
most is their tackling, and that will be at the back of South African
minds.
They hit late and often high, partly to intimidate, and partly to make
contact with opponents above the centre of gravity, and where the All
Blacks have their rucking to strike fear in opposition hearts, the
Samoans have their contact skills and they milk it for all that it's
worth.
''Tackling is second nature to us,'' said Umaga. ''We all like banging
into each other in training. It has become a matter of pride in the team
that no-one misses a tackle, and it is an unwritten law that each tackle
has to be as hard and as spectacular as possible.'' Some are very
spectacular.
And yet it must be a natural attribute as well because New Zealand
schools are finding trouble in keeping white kids in rugby when their
islander class-mates mature earlier and bang for keeps.
Just how the Samoans have made it this far would be a very good thesis
topic. I remember having to wait an hour for an interview with Pat Lam
in the 1991 World Cup because his team was too busy singing, and perhaps
that gives a hint as to the close-knit nature of the players in the
side, coming, as they do, from a set up that has only around 4000
players.
Many play in New Zealand, and, like we Scots, it's just possible that
the Samoans are driven by a passion that can only grow from a small
country that just isn't taken seriously on the big pitch.
''We come from such a small place, and I suppose we don't get any
respect and that hurts,'' says Umaga. ''People don't think of us as a
serious rugby nation. The South Africans think that they know it all and
the public here can see no other nation but South Africa. We find it all
very sad, but we find it all very motivating, too.
''There is a lot riding on this game for us because we want all the
families back home to see us do well, and we want the kids back home to
want to play rugby.''
To beat the South Africans, his team will need to win more ball than
it has done, especially against the one side that seems blatantly to
have been allowed to lift in every lineout of the tournament and get
away with it. The way Kobus Wiese gets up in the air is a joke.
''We have worked hard on our set-piece play this week,'' claimed
Umaga, ''There has been some vigorous training I can tell you.''
He looks back on his days at GHK with affection, saying that he
genuinely felt well treated and made to feel welcome in Glasgow, but he
tempers that by saying that the rugby: ''wasn't what I expected it to be
in Scotland -- a bit soft.''
Umaga enjoyed again meeting Jeremy Richardson at the players' lunch at
the start of the tournament, and says that Scotland and Western Samoa
have much in common. It probably rains there.
So, the GHK man playing for Western Samoa, hopefully, will provide a
few Glasgow fans with some stimulus this weekend when South Africa
tumble out of the competition.
It's a shame Bill McLaren isn't doing the telly. Umaga crosses for the
try that beats South Africa, and the great man's voice pierces the
crowd'' . . . and they'll be cheering . . . '' says McLaren ''. . . down
Old Anniesland way in Glasgow's West End''
Now that would be good.

THERE was a sneaking suspicion that Lord Weinstock was playing
something of a game in the battle for VSEL, encouraging British
Aerospace to overplay its hand by bidding too much for VSEL. This would
weaken the combined group, enabling GEC to proceed with its ultimate
strategy of buying the whole lot cheaply.
This has been shown to be wide of the mark. GEC's new #835m offer
makes it abundantly clear that Lord Weinstock wants VSEL as it stands
come what may.
If this is the case, then British Aerospace (BAe) will have to walk
away. However much it thinks VSEL would be a good addition to its
defence interests, it simply cannot match the awesome financial
fire-power of GEC, whose legendary cash mountain tops #1400m and its
share of cash in joint ventures is of a similar order.
GEC is offering a straight #21.50 in cash for each VSEL share and will
also have a loan note alternative. This compares with the #16 cash
alternative which BAe offered last week. Its share offer is worth more,
but still way behind GEC's price at nearly #18. VSEL has #400m cash in
its balance sheet, which effectively nets the cost to GEC to below
#500m.
VSEL is not throwing itself into GEC's hands just yet. It issued a
holding statement yesterday, advising shareholders to do nothing. Like
everybody else, VSEL is awaiting BAe's reaction. The latter said it had
''noted'' GEC's move and would respond in due course.
The GEC price has not been picked at random. In fact it is pitched
skilfully at just below the level which would be earnings dilutive for
BAe. It it is assumed that if BAe offered over #22 it would dilute its
earnings. This would cause rumbles of discontent from its shareholders,
who have recently helped put the group on a sound financial footing by
supporting a rights issue. Above this level the tax advantages also
start reducing.
Given that it could only raise its price to these levels through
increasing its share exchange offer it would have to pay nearer #25 for
a real chance of success, which looks untenable.
The market thinks the fight is over as VSEL shares closed below the
offer value at #21.40 (up 302p).
Commercially GEC looks the better partner. BAe made much of its
marketing links in the Middle East and Far East which it would exloit to
raise VSEL's sales of warships and submarines. But GEC is already a
warship builder through its Yarrow Shipbuilders. Together they will make
a broader business, with Yarrow's particular expertise in frigates and
VSEL's Barrow-in-Furness yard experienced in submarines and large
surface vessels. It also makes sense for a major customer of GEC's
electronic gadgets and weapon systems to come in-house.
GEC will become almost the monopoly supplier of UK built warships,
strengthening its hand in dealings with the Ministry of Defence which
obviously wants to retain an indigenous shipbuilding capacity. Having
GEC's financial strength behind it must improve VSEL's chances in export
markets.
BAe could yet cobble together a rival bid, if only to force GEC to pay
even more, but this would only delay the inevitable conclusion that Lord
Weinstock has got VSEL in the bag.

FOR once ordinary employees and not just directors stand to make a
killing from the VSEL bid. Some 1900 employees held 739,000 shares
through a share option scheme as at March last year. They will realise
an average profit of some #7000 each.
Directors own 115,000 shares directly worth #2.5m, with the largest
holding, 79,000, belonging to Professor John Ffowcs Williams, a
non-executive director who sold his research company, which helped
reduce the noise levels of VSEL's submarines, to VSEL for shares. He
will collect #1.7m. Directors have options over 7600 shares exercisable
at prices varying from 407p to 853p and worth a potential #164,000.
Chief executive Noel Davies holds 15,500 shares directly worth #330,000.
Chairman Lord Chalfont holds just 642 shares.

SCOTLAND are now just three victories away from playing in the
European Championship finals in England next summer -- and these
victories can all be achieved at Hampden.
Basically the most difficult work has now been done by manager Craig
Brown and his oft-criticised squad, and the game plan worked out by
Brown and SFA Chief Executive Jim Farry has been justified.
Brown and Farry wanted to end the qualifying group with a run of home
games which could decide qualification.
Now the Scots must concentrate on wins against Greece, Finland, and
San Marino to hit a jackpot which could be worth close to #2m if they
get to the finals in England.
Yesterday, Brown was not yet ready to accept congratulations, but he
did admit: ''This is the position we had hoped to be in at this stage of
the tournament, that we would be sitting here with the knowledge that
qualification was in our own hands.
''We did not want to be sitting on the sidelines on this side of the
Border when a major tournament was going on in England. Many of us
suffered that back in 1966 when we failed to get to the finals of the
World Cup.
The scenario is plain enough -- three wins and the Scots are there.
But it could be that we will even be allowed a little stumble on the
cash-laden path to the finals.
Finland and Greece play in Helsinki on Sunday and can cause damage to
each other. Then the Finns, as well as coming to Hampden, must play
Russia twice. And Greece who are in Glasgow in August have a hazardous
journey to Moscow as well.
Personally I cannot see the Scots fail to qualify now that they have
reached this position. The problem which Brown faces is that he must
discard some of the men who might have helped him reach his objective.
''If they are not going to the finals, for example, if we get there
and I stress the IF, then I will have to tell them why.
''No one would seriously expect me to go into games without the likes
of Gary McAllister, Colin Hendry, Paul McStay and Stuart McCall if they
are fit.''
Brown is hopeful that most of the men who missed out on the outing to
the Faroes will be ready for the Greek game. He has had good news
concerning Aberdeen striker Scott Booth and he still clings to the hope
that Ally McCoist could yet make a contribution to these championships.
And there are Duncan Ferguson, Eoin Jess, and Kevin Gallacher to think
about for the striking roles.
Meanwhile, as a bonus, Brown discovered the 23-year-old Craig Burley,
who will not be one of the men left out of future plans. The Chelsea
player is a find, a player for the future, and not the distant future at
that.

ARSENAL, who have been tarnished more than most other English clubs in
a shameful season of sleaze, yesterday turned to former Scotland
internationalist Bruce Rioch for help when they appointed him manager in
succession to another Scot, George Graham, whose time at Highbury ended
in controversy and amid allegations of backhanders.
Rioch left his post at Bolton Wanderers ''with great regret'' but
could not resist the challenge to manage what he regards as one of the
largest clubs in the country.
The 47-year-old could not even be tempted to remain at Burnden Park by
a salary of #200,000 offered by chairman Gordon Hargreaves, who had
hoped Rioch would stay and lead the club in the Premiership.
Rioch's right-hand man at Burnden Park, Colin Todd, will probably be
promoted to manager of Bolton and that should mean Scot Stuart Houston,
who stood in after Graham left and took Arsenal to the final of the
European Cup-winners' Cup, will remain at Highbury.
* ENGLAND midfield player Paul Ince is stunned by the news that
Manchester United have accepted a record-breaking bid of around #8m to
sell him to Inter-Milan.
Ince, who last week pledged his allegiance to United, says he does not
want to leave the club but he feels that he may have to.
But his agent Steve Kutner insists that it is not a foregone
conclusion that he will agree to a new career in Italy when he discusses
his personal terms with Inter officials next week.
''Paul was every bit as surprised as the fans when they heard that
United had agreed on a fee with Inter,'' said Kutner.
''He has never asked United for a transfer and never will. He is very
settled at Old Trafford and has never thought about leaving.''
If Ince does agree terms with Inter, he is expected to made captain of
the club and earn around #25,000 a week.
* JIMMY Nicholl moved closer to the exit at Stark's Park with an
invitation to travel to Norwich next week for further talks about
becoming manager of the Carrow Road club.
The Raith Rovers manager met Norwich City chairman Robert Chase in
Edinburgh on Wednesday night and talks will continue south of the
Border.
However, if Nicholl likes what he sees at the beginning of next week
the likelihood is that he will disappoint Raith and open a new chapter
on his career.

SCOTLAND'S under-21 side took to the shimmering waters of the
Mediterranean yesterday hoping to find a cure to their injury crisis.
For 10 of the side are undergoing treatment before tonight's tie
against South Korea which will decide their fate in the Toulon
International Tournament.
Team manager Tommy Craig's main concern is over striker Doug Freedman
and captain Steven Pressley, who are both very doubtful.
But there are also worries over Christian Dailly, David Hannah,
Stephen Glass, Jamie Fullerton, Colin McDonald, Duncan Jupp, Andy
Liddell, and Jim Hamilton.
Craig said: ''It's touch and go whether Freedman and Pressley make it.
To lose either would be a damaging blow at such a critical stage.
''Freedman, who has a calf strain, is the most seriously injured but
the medical staff are working continuously to have everyone available.
''I'm hoping the salt water treatment will hasten the process and ease
the aches and pains.
''The nature of this tournament means there is no time to recover from
injuries.
''But the players must be protected from themselves as they all want
to play regardless of their physical state.''
Scotland self-destructed a year ago when they went down to a poor
Belgian side and with it went their chance of a place in the last four.
Craig is certain there will be no repeat of that anti-climax this
time.
He explained: ''Even though we may only need a draw against the
Koreans, all our efforts will be aimed at securing victory. That way no
one will be in any doubt about what is required.''

SHOPPERS reined in their spending in Britain's high streets last
month, a key business survey revealed yesterday -- underlining the
weakness of consumer confidence.
But retailers still seem intent on pushing up prices, which rose at
the fastest rate for two years, according to the Confederation of
British Industry's monthly distributive trades' survey.
The proportion of retailers reporting an increase in sales in May
compared with a year ago, minus those reporting a decline, was 8%
compared with 25% in April, when the late timing of Easter lifted trade.
This was less than expected, but indicated that the underlying trend
over the latest three months in sales was growing again after being flat
for several months, the CBI said.
Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades' survey
panel, added: ''But with consumers remaining cautious it would be unwise
to assume that retailing as a whole is on an upward trend.
''Retailers have found it difficult to forecast accurately trading
conditions over the past 18 months. They still consider business to be
below average though the position has improved since the early part of
this year.''
Apart from the regular monthly questions, the survey also included
extra questions covering prices, employment, investment, and business
optimism.
Spending on capital equipment is expected to be flat over the year
ahead compared with the previous 12 months, but retailers remain
optimistic about the general business situation over the short term.
However, there was a sharp reminder that despite subdued consumer
demand, inflation pressures remain strong.
The balance of retailers reporting higher prices rose from 23% in
February to 31% last month, a two year high.
The CBI said this was well below its long-term average, but the
outlook is for a slightly faster rate of price increases in June when
demand is expected to pick up slightly.

ENGLAND and future Rangers player Paul Gascoigne was accused of
breaking the nose of Swedish star Magnus Erlingmark last night. ''I was
hit by an elbow in the face, but I didn't see who did it,'' said
Erlingmark.
But Swedish coach Tommy Svensson pointed an accusing finger at the
Englishman after the nail-biting 3-3 draw at Elland Road. He said:
''Gazza elbowed him in the face, and we didn't like it.''
But Gascoigne, who came on as substitute, was astonished at the
accusations and said: ''I am absolutely gutted. I didn't mean it.''
The alleged incident occurred just before England's second goal, David
Platt's twenty-sixth for his country, a minute from time. England were
3-1 down with two minutes to go but goals from Platt and Darren Anderton
spared their blushes in the Umbro Cup clash.
* SPECULATION may surround John Collins' future, but Celtic secured
the services of Paul McStay for two more years when he accepted
re-signing terms and the challenge of leading the club into the European
Cup-winners' Cup.
Tony Mowbray, Rudi Vata, and Mark McNally have still to accept terms.

W H SMITH, Britain's largest retailer of books, videos and stationery,
is to part company with its managing director of retailing after its
shares tumbled on a warning of low profits.
The group, which has 450 stores, said Mr Peter Troughton would leave
on July 31 ''as a result of a long-term review of board responsibilities
and by mutual agreement''.
Last month W H Smith warned that profits this year would be lower than
expected because of flagging sales, especially over the Easter period.
Its shares fell by 15% on the news.
Mr Kevin Hawkins, corporate affairs director of W H Smith, said Mr
Troughton's departure was not directly related to the profits warning.
Under the new structure, Peter Bamford, head of W H Smith Retail, Alan
Giles, chief of specialist bookseller Waterstones, and Simon Burke, head
of the Virgin/Our Price music chain, will report directly to chief
executive Sir Malcolm Field.

Take me back to the Black Hills,
the Black Hills of Dakota,
to the beautiful Indian
coun-tree that I love.
YOU and me both, Calamity Jane. I have loved the Black Hills of Dakota
in my childhood dreams, although I've never been there, but the Lakota
Sioux love them more. In 1980 America's Supreme Court awarded the Lakota
$105m for the theft of their sacred lands, but the tribal elders turned
it down. They want the Black Hills back, which is tricky for the US
Government which, having plundered their gold and mineral reserves over
the years, has turned them into the tourist centrepiece of a national
park; a home where recreational vehicles roam.
Yellowstone. Little Big Horn. Powder River. Names as potent as Flodden
or Culloden, maybe even more suggestive, to children raised in the
fifties. The pre-eminent film critic of the post-war years believed the
Western to be the noblest achievement of Hollywood, but she wasn't
sentimental about its myths. Dilys Powell, who died last weekend, didn't
deplore the revisionist Westerns of the eighties and nineties and died a
Clint Eastwood fan.
Even in the fifties the old white-hat-black-hat morality was coming
under scrutiny and although the term ''Native American'' hadn't been
invented there was some awareness that the Red Man's version of history
required attention, too. While John Ford's cavalry trilogy celebrated
the boys in blue with Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio
Grande, Delmer Daves made Broken Arrow, with Jeff Chandler as the Apache
chief Cochise and James Stewart as an ex-Army man trying to broker peace
between feuding settlers and Indians.
Film historians now call this movie ''authentic'', and I reckon it
shifted my seven-year-old sympathies from paleface to redskin. (Another
seminal influence was a novel called Softfoot of Silver Creek, and I'd
be glad if anyone can tell me who wrote it.) What I didn't and couldn't
know was that Broken Arrow's screenplay, although credited to Michael
Blankfort, was actually written by Albert Maltz, whose name was on the
Hollywood blacklist of the McCarthy years. No wonder Cochise got a fair
hearing.
I knew them all in those days: Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo,
Red Cloud, and I could place them in their tribes, much as I knew the
names of the most glamorous Scottish clans and the titles of their
chiefs. ''On my side you're a MacGregor,'' said my mother, feeding the
infant appetite for romance; and for her own amusement she added, ''My
granny MacGregor always swore that we're directly descended from Rob
Roy.''
I went to see the movie about my legendary ancestor the other day and,
whatever its artistic merits and demerits, I came away feeling that for
once Scotland had not been traduced by the great dream factory over the
pond; perhaps because (and notwithstanding the local experience of
writer, director, and producer) Hollywood was dealing with a perfected
genre.
How convincingly nineteenth-century Montana became eighteenth-century
Lomondside. How persuasively the tribes of the Great Plains became the
tribes of Gaeldom, and the bluecoats of the US Cavalry became the
redcoats of the Crown. Reviewers have already identified Rob Roy as a
Western, to no surprise; the history of the Gael, their dispossession
and degradation, the systematic dismantling of their culture, is the
history of the Native American writ small.
Channel 4's sonorous series The Wild West has also been required
viewing for this one-time junior brave, who never did manage to
stockpile enough scraps of silver birch to make a birchbark canoe or
collect enough feathers for a war bonnet. To Monday's instalment I owe
an update on the events surrounding the Battle of the Little Big Horn,
and the resonances were striking.
The alliance of tribes led by Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse was more
the last gasp of the Sioux nation than the last stand of General George
Custer. The Indians won the battle but lost the war. The Little Big Horn
was the Red Man's Culloden. The tribes dispersed and as soon as they
were starved into the subsistence security of reservations (the massive
herds of buffalo on which their nomadic culture depended had been
reduced to near-extinction by the new Americans) the Bureau of Indian
Affairs began proscribing their customs, their religion, and their
language.
Even more eerily familiar was the next stage of their humiliation: the
culture of the tribes took its first steps on the long and winding road
to a future in tourism. The Gaels had Sir Walter Scott, the Native
Americans had Colonel William Cody. Less than 10 years after the Battle
of the Little Big Horn the man whose braves wiped out Custer's company
of the 7th was paid $50 a week to tour the Eastern cities with Buffalo
Bill's Wild West Show. Appalled by the squalor of Chicago, Sitting Bull
spent most of his earnings on handouts to beggar children.
But domestication and a role in the entertainment industry didn't save
the Sioux chief from white fear of his power. He died violently in a
botched arrest in 1890, in the fever of paranoia induced by the spread
of the Ghost Dance, the desperate ritual by which tribes grieving for
their vanished way of life tried to dance, dream, and pray their way
back to the past. A few months later, the massacre of men, women, and
children by soldiers of the 7th Cavalry (Custer avenged) made the name
of Wounded Knee as infamous to the Lakota as Glencoe is to the
MacDonalds.
Movies, documentaries, histories, handouts -- the overdue process of
expiation increasingly preoccupies white Americans. Painfully, Native
Americans recover something of the lost soul of their tribes through
''ethnic studies'' and cultural centres. Ironically, their efforts
aren't always trashed by the ham fists of tourism, which for all its
crassness helps validate their traditions and fosters a sense of
separate identity. Much like the Highland heritage industry.
Maybe old Sitting Bull knew what he was doing when he joined the cast
of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Maybe Rob Roy MacGregor would give his
blessing to a multi-media visitor centre in Callandar; although
personally I'd rather go looking for their ghosts on the Black Hills of
Dakota and the Braes of Balquidder.

STEFFI Graf yesterday fought off a fine comeback by Conchita Martinez
to reach the final of he French Open in Paris.
The German, cruising at 6-3, 4-1, finally needed more than
two-and-a-half hours to dispose of the Spaniard 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 in a
match well worthy of the final itself.
Graf's victory earned her a revenge clash tomorrow with world No.1 and
defending champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who had earlier defeated
Japan's Kimiko Date 7-5, 6-3.
If the first semi-final was a lacklustre affair, prompting little more
than polite applause from the centre-court crowd, the second was the
complete opposite, in terms of suspense and the superb level of play.
Martinez's comeback in the second set was astonishing. Graf, who did
not play badly at any time, had five points on her serve for 5-1, before
the Spanish fourth seed, unbeaten on clay all year, finally broke her.
Graf then led 5-3, but Martinez pulled back to 5-5 after the German
had come within two points of the match, going on to win a tight
tie-break 7-5.
Many observers had rated the on-form player from Barcelona as the
title favourite, and she seemed about to turn things her way in the
final set when Graf went down 0-40 on serve at 3-3.
But the German was in determined mood, holding serve and breaking her
opponent in the next game before gaining victory on her third match
point.
Graf, who now gets a chance to avenge her 1989 French final defeat by
Sanchez, also would regain the world No.1 slot should she capture her
fourth French title in her seventh appearace in the final.
''At 4-1 in the second, I let it go, let her dictate the game,'' said
the German. ''I wasn't aggressive enough and I was constantly on the
defensive. She plays hard and low and mixes up her game. It was
difficult to find my rhythm.''
Graf added that it had been her longest match of the year. ''I'm
really happy I was able to go the distance. I fought to the end and I'm
really happy about that.''
Earlier, Kimiko Date, the first Japanese to reach a semi-final of this
tournament, and Sanchez Vicario played out a match that was instantly
forgettable, the Spaniard winning 7-5, 6-3.

Hoylake
GORDON Sherry, the runner-up last year, yesterday moved nearer to a
rematch with his conqueror Lee James, when he came through hard games
against two other Walker Cup team candidates, David Park of Wales and
Sherry's compatriot Barclay Howard in the third and fourth rounds of the
Amateur Championship at Hoylake.
This morning Sherry meets English internationalist David Howell and
will play James in the semi-final round unless the holder falls to
Wick's Roger Beames, the other Scot in the last eight.
The two other Scottish casualties were David Downie, the strokeplay
champion, and Alan Reid, last year's beaten finalist in the national
championship.
The combination of a strong and bitterly cold north-wester a demanding
course, and desperately slow play caused the championship committee,
rather belatedly, to post a warning.
Sherry needed 4hr 15min to dispose at the last of Park and had
scarcely quarter of an hour's rest before confronting Howard who,
despite having taken more than three hours for 13 holes, had 90 minutes
latitude.
After 53 matchplay holes in two days, however, Sherry was more
mentally than physically tired. Howard, having had a resurgence of form
in recent weeks, gave him the close fight he expected and Sherry said:
''It was a pity it had to be Barclay and I am just pleased to be through
again.''
Sherry advanced after a lively contest which, despite the harsh
conditions, spawned seven birdies. The decisive holes were the twelfth,
which Sherry took with a bogey 5, and the long fourteenth won with a
birdie. Although Howard gained the fifteenth in par, Sherry allowed no
further encroachment.
To some extent, Beames escaped fortunately the consequences of his
inexperience and impulsiveness. He seemed on the verge of securing a
convincing victory when he stood three up and four to play on England's
Scott Drummond, but he played the fifteenth badly and lost the long
sixteenth to a birdie and suddenly the contest had become uncomfortably
tight.
Inexplicably, when his drive at the seventeenth plunged into dense
rough, only 15 yards in front of the tee, Beames made the most cursory
search for the ball before he conceded the hole. He did win the last by
pitching to five feet and holing for a birdie three after Drummond had
hit a 40-yard bunker shot to six feet and made the par putt.
Downie, who defends his Scottish Strokeplay title next weekend, went
out to Michael Reynard, a 33-year-old former professional. Reynard was
never down after he had squared at the 393-yard second, where Downie had
prevailed over Richard Bland at their twentieth hole by hitting a No.3
wood down wind into a greenside bunker then holing a 20-foot birdie
putt.

NOT even a course-record 66 from Alison Nicholas could eclipse World
No.1 Laura Davies, who swept into the halfway lead in the Evian Masters
in France yesterday.
Davies gathered six birdies and an eagle in a 67 which left her at
nine under par on 135 to lead by two from Nicholas and Sweden's Catrin
Nilsmark. Dale Reid matched Davies's haul of birdies in a 70 to lead the
Scots on 145.
Nicholas birdied three of her first six holes. Out in 32, she dropped
her only shot of the day at the long fifteenth where she overhit the
green. But she struck a No.3-wood to eight feet for an eagle 3 at the
last. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
135 -- L Davies 68, 67.
137 -- C Nilsmark (Sweden) 68, 69; A Nicholas 71, 66.
139 -- T Johnson 68, 71; H Wadsworth 67, 72.
140 -- L Hackney 68, 72; C Dibnah (Australia) 70, 70; A Sorenstam
(Sweden) 68, 72.
Scottish scores: 145 -- D Reid 75, 70. 148 -- J Forbes 76, 72; G
Stewart 75, 73. 157 C Panton-Lewis 78, 79.
* EUROPEAN Tour member Vijay Singh birdied the first three holes on
his way to a share of the first round lead at the $1.4m Kemper Open in
Washington yesterday.
Singh took advantage of his early tee time to record five birdies on
the front nine before a gusty breeze sprang up on a steamy day at the
Avenel TPC course. He added one more birdie on the back nine to join
American Robert Gamez at six-under-par 65.
Seve Ballesteros carded a bogey-free three-under 68. Leading scores
(U.S. unless stated)
65 -- Vijay Singh (Fiji), Robert Gamez.
66 -- Jeff Maggert, Mark O'Meara, Steve Lowery, Wayne Grady
(Australia).
67 -- Larry Mize, Phil Blackmar, Marco Dawson, Jesper Parnevik
(Sweden), Andrew Magee, Tom Kite, Kelly Gibson.
Other Europeans: 68 -- Seve Ballesteros (Spain), Miguel Jimenez
(Spain); 71 --Jose Maria Olazabal (Spain).
* VALERIE Melvin yesterday warmed up for next week's British Women's
championship at Royal Portrush when her three-over-par 71 won the
scratch prize at the Dunbartonshire and Argyll Ladies meeting at Vale of
Leven. Results:
Scratch: 71 -- V Melvin (Clydebank and District). Silver: Handicap: 71

AQAARID is confidently expected to give trainer John Dunlop his third
success in the Oaks, following Circus Plume in 1984 and Salsabil in '90,
at Epsom this afternoon.
The filly has followed a similar route to Epsom as that taken by
Salsabil, but where she was successful in the 1000 Guineas, Aqaarid,
although running well, could manage only second.
Dunlop's charge appeared to find the ground at Newmarket too lively.
She was held up until making good headway two out and ran on well but
was unable to cope with Harayir's turn of foot.
Aqaarid is capable of improvement over a longer trip and on easier
going, which she should encounter today.
Someone else who will find matters to his liking is French champion
jockey Thierry Jarnet, who was given a boost yesterday with the news
that his mount, Pennekamp, drew a mid-field stall for tomorrow's Derby.
Jarnet, trying to give Sheikh Mohammed his first success in the race,
will be helped by being in stall No.5 on the favourite.
Runners drawn toward the centre have fared best in the premier classic
over the years, with four horses placed third from a No.5 draw in the
last 11 runnings.
In a field of 15, the smallest since 1991, Jarnet ought to have every
chance to settle Pennekamp and choose his position before the horses
begin the descent to Tattenham Corner.
Celtic Swing and the injured Sebastian were the only defectors at
yesterday's declaration stage. The ground appears to have gone against
Celtic Swing, winner of the Prix du Jockey-Club.
''There was no rain overnight at Epsom and the forecast is only for
showers so we decided it was best not to declare,'' said a spokesman for
owner Peter Savill.
Sebastian's withdrawal was anticipated after the Henry Cecil colt had
sustained a back injury during his final piece of work in Newmarket.
Brian Rouse snapped up the remaining spare ride, the veteran rider
agreeing to partner Daffaq, who will make the pace for Munwar and Fahal,
leaving Sebastian's rider, Pat Eddery, without a ride in the classic for
the first time since 1971.
* AN appeal by connections of Carling against the decision of the
Longchamp stewards to uphold Matiara as winner of the French 1000
Guineas has failed.
But winning rider Freddie Head, Olivier Peslier, and Cash Asmussen
have been give four-day riding bans for their part in a barging incident
two furlongs from the finish.

IT WAS made of Bakelite. It was called a telephone. Back in the 1950s
a telephone was essentially for business purposes. I mean businessmen
used them. To this day they do and there are lots of ways of
establishing status with Bell's invention. Truly top executives don't
even carry a mobile. If you should ever see these idjits talking over
their carry-around telephones in restaurants then you should know that
they are low-echelon chaps. If they were that top-level they could
afford to have lunch without being interrupted. A dead give-away the
ring on the bell that is.
There is also the essential, for a journalist, piece of technology,
the answering machine. Frankly it is not that essential at all. I had an
answering machine for a couple of months but it took to waking me up at
three in the morning and there wasn't much point anyway because if
anybody wants to contact me by phone they can always do it in the six
bars I frequent. There is more chance of getting me sober in a pub than
there ever is at home.
Most of you AB readers out there will have telephones and don't think
anything about it, the way few of you under the age of 50 would be
surprised to discover that nobody had baths, and lots of us lived with
stairheid toilets.
As I write now the most distinguished Economics Editor in the world,
Alf Young, reveals to me that he didnae have an inside bath either and
he had left university before his mum and dad put in a telephone. His
mum's first phone call was to congratulate him on his degree. It was a
First Class Masters. Mind you, it was in Physics. Hardly worth a phone
call at all I would have thought but his mum and dad came from Greenock
and colouring in a book was regarded there in much the same way as the
Nobel Prize.
The telephone, says Alf, was made of Bakelite. They all were then. Now
they are not. Now they are made of greediness.
When British Telecom went into business for business it went into it
for profit. The fact that all of its employees had previously been so
for the GPO didn't matter very much. The employees continued to be very
nice and pleasant people and the fact that they were now employed by
greedy capitalists didn't make all that much difference to them except
that they were paid less and under threat of the immediate sack and all
their bosses were going to slip more and more poppy into their pouches
and the service would deteriorate beyond belief; despite that the
employees continued to do what they always had done. They looked after
you. Because they were punters like yersel.
BUT British Telecom was staffed at the top with the sort of people who
become Cabinet Ministers before they become company directors for the
firms they privatised.
Now let us come to telephones. There is of course British Telecom. And
Mercury. And also a mob called Dialpoint. It has a helpline and its
number is O345 010108. What they want with a helpline naebody knows
because when it comes to taking the hard-earned off of you this
rapacious set of spivs need no help at all.
Here is the dodge. You put your money in, say ten pence. Or twenty
pence. Or if awash with lucre, fifty. Dialpoint even has the cheek to
take a quid coin. What you don't get is your money back. Sorry says
Dialpoint, no money back. Let me tell you how this scam works.
On most telephone systems you put your money in and then nobody
answers and then you put the receiver down and then the coin slides down
and you are a bit pissed off to discover that your sweetheart, or
whoever you telephoned at all, isn't in, and can then help to pay for
the wee half you have ordered with the ten pence piece or whatever.
Under Dialpoint Let's Make Poppy you don't get your money back at all.
This set of entrepreneurs tell you in advance on the telephone set
itself admittedly that they do not return any money at all, but as most
of us are used to putting the money in first before we dial, by that
time we have lost the coins anyway.
This is making all these telephone companies squillions of
spondulicks; you better believe me. Telephone Dialpoint Helpline -- 0345
010108 and ask them how much: they will not tell you.
Here is what I will tell you. When I was a child there were old
telephones, made of Bakelite. Public and in private homes. There was an
A button which you pressed when the phone was answered, and a B Button
when it wasn't. That's when you got your four pennies back because the
telephone wasn't answered and you hadn't received the service which you
were supposed to pay for when you'd had the service in the first place.
Back then capitalism was as greedy as it is now. But mair honourable.

IF THE number of calls and conversations I've had since my last column
on Tuesday is any yardstick, the hot topics of boardroom remuneration
and corporate accountability and what to do about them show no signs of
cooling off. The temperature, if anything, is climbing.
When the best response that old blunderbuss Lord King can come up
with, when under fire over his latest 10% pay rise, is: ''What do you
want me to do? Work for nothing?'' you just know the debate has
developed a formidable momentum all of its own. His Lordship's
spluttering inability to participate meaningfully is, I suspect, in
direct proportion to the issue's growing impact, exactly where it hurts
most.
The former British Airways chairman is now chairman of Aerostructures
Hamble, which came to the market at 120p a share last summer. After
production problems on a Harrier jump jet contract and profit warnings
in September and October, the shares crashed. But Lord King's part-time,
non-executive salary went up 10% to just over #70,000.
The man from Abbey Life, a significant shareholder nursing a large
paper loss, objected. ''Shouldn't you have taken a cut?'' he inquired.
The pocket blunderbuss reportedly demanded his questioner justify his
own income, then launched into that plaintive Work for Nothing? routine.
Let us put the spluttering to one side and attempt a cooler, more
rational appraisal of what's at stake. Since Tuesday, apart from Lord
King's choleric outburst, we've had, in Scotland alone, news of the
latest share option profit netted by Stakis chief executive David
Michels and the #2.17m pay-out to four former Dawson International
executives, ousted in a boardroom coup.
It's been put to me this week that the central danger in all this
intense media and public preoccupation with who's getting what and why
in each and every boardroom up and down the land is the damage it will
do to the wider cause of enterprise promotion in this country.
There is a near consensus that, to meet the challenge of revitalising
the Scottish economy, where the old monolithic, mass employment
industries, like coal, shipbuilding, and engineering are now pale
shadows of what they once were, we need to encourage the creation of
more new competitive growth enterprises capable of generating fresh
wealth for future generations.
That's what Scottish Enterprise's business birth rate strategy is
supposed to be all about. Similar concerns lie at the heart of CBI
Scotland's business agenda initiative. Last month the CBI achieved a
minor miracle when it got leaders of the four main political parties in
Scotland to sit round one table and sign up for an action programme to
promote enterprise in schools. The document they all put their names to
says: ''The people of Scotland need to use their skills and enterprise
to create their own wealth and self-sufficiency in a competitive
world.''
But, the argument goes, enterprise and reward go hand in hand. If
Scots are to take enterprise to their hearts, they need to rethink their
traditional suspicion of those whose rewards, thanks to their successful
enterprise, are markedly greater than the norm. Another CBI agenda
document raises precisely that issue when it asks: ''Do those
(enterprising Scots emigrants) who have ambition regard the financial
rewards in Scotland as inadequate or do they regard our culture as too
hostile?''
So is there a danger that all this censorious public exposure of rich
boardroom pickings will frighten the potentially enterprising Scot back
into the heather, like grouse deafened by the clatter of hostile August
guns? Perhaps. But it shouldn't.
Those who take risks and start businesses which create wealth and
provide work are, in my book, fully entitled to the personal rewards
success brings. In cases where a business is on the fringes of
legitimacy, or that success is gained by unfairly exploiting the efforts
of others, for example through poverty wages, that entitlement
dissolves. But for mainstream business builders, why should they not
enjoy the rewards their risk-taking and effort may bring?
Equally those, like David Michels, who take a business which is on its
knees and play a lead role in bringing it back from the brink -- or take
a sound but mature business and successfully diversify it into new
markets -- deserve significant incentives to succeed. Personally I am
uncomfortable with the prevailing consensus, here and America, that
corporate turnarounds typically require a lone ranger figure to sort
things out. But I do not quarrel with the idea that those who effect
rescues or genuinely grow mature businesses deserve rewards for their
efforts.
The legitimate boardroom targets of public concern fall into two
categories. First there are those who appear to be disproportionately
rewarded for failure. Why should Lord King get a pay rise when the share
price has crashed? Why should company directors be on two-year,
three-year or even longer rolling contracts when the rest of us have to
make do with a week's, a month's or, at best, three month's notice? I
have yet to hear a legitimate justification of what is, in effect, a
golden parachute to ease the pain of failure and departure from the top
floor.
And then there are the directors of mature companies, typified in the
public mind by the monopoly or near-monopoly utilities. Let's dispose of
the enterprise/reward issue right away. They are typically managers not
entrepreneurs. Too many are getting bigger and bigger rewards for
managing, at best, stasis, at worst, actual decline. And even where a
mature business is still growing, there are too many executive
recipients whose disproportionate rewards imply, quite wrongly in my
view, that success rests solely on the efforts of those sitting round
the boardroom table.
The really successful mature businesses, long term, are those which
share the material rewards of progress from the top of the organisation
to the bottom. They are the ones which recognise a fundamental reality.
Maintaining progress in mature businesses in highly competitive markets
is only possible by taking your people with you -- giving them
responsibility, challenging them to contribute new ideas, and giving
them a stake in the outcome.
You can cut out layer after layer of management and decimate the
shopfloor. You can demand that everyone else remaining work twice as
hard for the same money. You can point to the impact of all that cost
cutting on the bottom line and claim your big reward for taking all
those tough decisions. But unless you take your people with you and grow
the business, what new trick do you have up your sleeve the next time
the business cycle puts the squeeze on you?

Hamburg
Baker and Costantino Rocca, two players determined to retain their
places in the European Ryder Cup team in September, were in hot pursuit
of leader Bernhard Langer in the Deutsche Bank Open in Hamburg last
night.
Langer led at the end of the first round with a five-under-par 67 in
cold, damp and windy weather. Italian Rocca lay one shot back -- joint
second with Jamie Spence -- while Baker was in joint fourth place on 69.
Rocca, bitterly disappointed that he will not be playing in the US
Open at Shinnecock Hills, New York, next week because of a
misunderstanding about the eligibility rules, is already fourth in the
Ryder Cup points table.
If he wins the Hamburg tournament, with its first prize of #108,330,
he can start getting measured for his cup outfit with complete
confidence.
Baker has far more to do because he is lying thirtieth and needs to
win here to move up to tenth. But the 27-year-old Wolverhampton player
does not lack confidence.
Two years ago he forced his way into the European team with two late
victories in the Scandinavian Masters and the Dunhill British Masters
and said: ''I need at least one victory and maybe a second and I've got
12 tournaments to do it in. But it would be nice to win this week.''
Both Baker and Rocca admit Langer, who always appears to play well in
his native Germany, is the man to beat. Out early, Langer had six
birdies and only one bogey.
Colin Montgomerie, already assured of a Ryder Cup place, and
big-hitting American John Daly both shot 72, and the best-placed Scot
was Gary Orr, who continued his upward fortunes with a 70.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
67 -- B Langer (Germany).
68 -- J Spence, C Rocca (Italy).
69 -- M Lanner (Sweden), P Baker, E Canonica (Italy), I Garrido

The Glasgow assistant carded a final round of level-par 68 in tough
windy conditions on the New Course for a four-round total of 271,
six-under-par, two better than Euan McIntosh.
Greaves, 25, has now won more than #6000 in the last month. ''I do

ENGLAND captain Mike Atherton just kept switching himself off during
the stop-start opening to the first Cornhill Test against the West
Indies at Headingley.
Including the two official intervals, Atherton had to make eight fresh
starts, but perished for 81 to what proved to be the last ball of a
fragmented day, in which England finished at 148 for four.
''It wasn't easy, but neither was it easy for the bowlers and
fielders. It was a difficult day for everyone and difficult to keep your
concentration high,'' said Atherton. ''You just had to take guard and
start again.
''We were in a good position at at 142 for two, but disappointed to
lose two wickets at the end of the day.''
Atherton is now counting on his two remaining front-line batsmen, Alec
Stewart and Mark Ramprakash, and a sound contribution from the lower
order, to restore England's initiative, gained after West Indies captain
Richie Richardson had gambled by fielding first.
It was Ian Bishop, the born-again fast bowler, who spared his
captain's blushes. Bishop, whose career has twice been threatened by
serious back injury, marked his first Test for two years by dismissing
Atherton just when Headingley was preparing to celebrate a gallant
century.
Bishop, well into an excellent second spell, produced a booming
in-swinger to trap Graham Thorpe leg before. Then, two balls later, he
had Atherton caught behind.
Kenny Benjamin, surprisingly preferred to Winston Benjamin, struck
with his twelfth delivery. Robin Smith, who was just beginning to appear
comfortable, tried to play his favourite square cut and the penalty as
Richardson held a good catch at third slip.
Two overs later, however, Richardson -- diving right -- reached, but
failed to hold, a more difficult chance when Benjamin clipped the
outside edge of Atherton's bat.
Graeme Hick helped Atherton to build a sound base before Thorpe and
his skipper pushed the home team nearer a promising position.

ASK any health service administrator and they will tell you that the
trouble with hospitals is all these patients who keep expecting
treatment.
This philosophy has now been put down in black and white in a report
on operating theatre facilities at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow. The
review refers to something called the CEPOD Report (Confidential Enquiry
Into Peri-Operative Deaths).
''This report also recommended that when possible emergency surgery is
best carried out during normal working hours,'' the Stobhill survey
states.
''From 8am to 5pm, Monday to Friday, emergency access to theatres is
somewhat restricted. Although a designated theatre is available, there
are a number of occasions when it is not staffed.
''This results in staff being pulled from elective sessions to
facilitate emergency surgery, often causing major disruption.''
So inconsiderate of these patients not to give proper notice of their
emergencies.
Other areas of behaviour which the Diary believes to be causing
concern to hospital administrators include:
* In-patients treating wards ''like hotels''. Some of them expect
three meals a day and do they ever think of bringing in their own clean
sheets? No.
* Many doctors, including some consultants who should know better, are
consistently failing to salute as they pass Unit Managers.
* Ambulance drivers repeatedly parking their vehicles at the entrances
to casualty units without getting the appropriate ticket from the pay
and display machine.
* Visitors ''skipping in'' to see patients without paying the entrance
fee.
How ithers see us
THE Diary has been surfing the Internet. To be exact, dipping our big
toe tentatively into the odd puddle on the hard shoulder of the
information superhighway.
The Hollywood fashion for Scottish movies has apparently sparked off
some interest on the Internet in matters Caledonian. We have been
browsing through the world-wide web of electronic communication to get
an impression of how ithers see us.
Should Scotland be independent? Can our culture and language survive
when international boundaries are being increasingly blurred by
satellite communications? Quite frankly, we don't know.
But we did find on the Internet someone wanting to know where they
could buy Irn-Bru in Boulder, Colorado. And a great debate about how
pizzas are cooked in Scotland. Is it true that you guys deep-fry pizzas
in great big vats of boiling animal fat? asks an incredulous American.
See the Internet? See Scottish culture?
The Number Game
THE new telephone code for Moscow
is 007. Thank you Miss Moneypenny.
For the record
MORE Scottish culture. Look out, and don't say we didn't warn you, for
a resurrection of a song called The Ballad of Rob Roy. Written by Tom
Walsh, a Glasgow schoolteacher and tunesmith, it was recorded in the
1950s by that well-known Scots crooner Larry Marshall.
The Ballad of Rob Roy was masterminded by record producer George
Martin who went on to achieve slightly more fame with a group called the
Beatles.
The 1990s version of Rob Roy, to cash in on the movie, is being
recorded by the Alexander Brothers. Mr Walsh passes on the esoteric
piece of information that the copyright to The Ballad of Rob Roy is now
owned by singer Michael Jackson.
Freedom of
Gotham City
WE have in front of us a news release from Warner Bros about a new
Batman promotion in their shops. The best bit of which is where Warner
have granted Scotland independence by referring to their stores ''in the
UK and Scotland''.
Dozy bandit
WE don't often concern ourselves with pubs at the Diary but a
correspondent tells us the Jinglin' Geordie pub in Fleshmarket Close,
Edinburgh -- a bar beloved by journalists, councillors, and court
officials alike -- became a scene of fear for owner and manager Roger
Downing recently.
Opening up one morning, he heard the distinctive noise of snoring
permeating the pub. Despite turning the premises upside down --
including the cellar and the toilets -- he was unable to trace what he
assumed to be an unwanted overnight guest.
The snores were eventually traced to the new state-of-the-art gaming
machine standing in the corner and installed only the day before. No-one
had warned mine host Roger that the hi-tech machine complains by
simulating noisy sleep patterns when the punters aren't playing.
Lost in France
* WELCOME et bienvenu to the Diary's Auld Alliance Roadshow. (Readers
who don't know what we are talking about should ask a friend or buy
back-numbers of the last two weeks' Herald.)
The following contributors to our journey through the Franco-Scottish
special relationship are now in the frame for the fabulous prizes of two
Air France tickets to Paris, a day on an Elf North Sea oil production
platform, dinner for two at Le Chardon restaurant in Edinburgh, or a
magnum of Bollinger:
* Dave Stormonth from Arkleston Road, Paisley, for a simple little
tale from the time he was working in Paris. One of his fellow Scots had
a night on the town and ended up un peu blootered. Could he find his
hotel? Non.
Thus a somewhat inebriated and confused Scot gave himself up to the
gendarmerie and confessed that he had no idea what hotel he was staying
in or where it was situated.
Could he perhaps give a clue, asked les flics. ''See that big tower
thing,'' he replied. ''I can see it from my hotel windae.''
* Mrs Jean Neilan of Boylstone Road, Barrhead, for a story of language
and that. A young French graduate was nearing the end of his year-long
exchange in a Glasgow office. It was fair to say that his gallic charms,
particularly his delicious French accent, had not gone unnoticed by the
girls in the office.
They decided that a parting gift was in order. The man himself was
asked what memento he would like. He was an outdoor type and asked for a
copy of the latest book by explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes.
His meaning got lost somewhere along the way and he was puzzled to
receive at his presentation a copy of the Renault 5 handbook.

NIGERIAN Davidson Ezinwa stole the limelight from Britain's world and
Olympic champion Linford Christie as he beat him into second place in
the 100 metres at the IAAF Golden Gala Grand Prix meeting yesterday in
Rome.
Ezinwa, the third fastest man over the distance last year, posted
10.10sec while Christie clocked 10.15.
But another British world champion, high hurdler Colin Jackson, won on
his first competitive apperance of the season, clocking 13.18 to beat
Americans Courtney Hawkins and Jack Pierce.
Jackson struggled a little for rhythm and had to dip for the line to
ensure victory. Hawkins clocked 13.24 for second place.
Venuste Niyongabo, of Burundi, failed in his bid for the 2000 metres
world record of 4min 50.81sec set by Moroccan Said Aouita in Paris
almost eight years ago.
Niyongabo, who trains in Siena in Italy, won in an unofficial time of
4-54.02.

WHAT a strange letter from David Watson on pollution caused by trams
(June 3).
As director of public affairs of an organisation that from its title
would appear to promote public transport, one would think it reasonable
for him to support the growth of tramway systems. Clearly the
Confederation of Passenger Transport UK had a misleading title, as it
can be assumed from David Watson's letter that his organisation is
pro-road and exists to promote passenger transport by bus and coach.
Clearly the confederation takes its lead in having a misleading title
from the Ministry of Transport, which also purports to support public
transport, but only if it does not run on rails.

Madrid, Thursday
CATALAN tourist officials today offered free holidays to the families
most affected by an outbreak of salmonella poisoning at a hotel at
Lloret de Mar, on the Costa Brava, which affected 200 Britons.
Seven British children are amongst 15 youngsters still being treated
in hospitals at Calella and Gerona following the outbreak at the
three-star Don Quixote hotel.
All fell ill after dinner on Saturday. Health authorities said milk
used to make a pudding was contaminated.
Mr Henry Connolly, 30, a lorry driver from Dumfries, whose
five-year-old son, Jason, is in Gerona Hospital, said: ''A tourist
official told me about the free holiday. We can bring the whole family.
''We will certainly take up the offer. This holiday has been a
disaster.''
Incoming holidaymakers booked at the Don Quixote are being sent to
nearby hotels.
An estimated 200 Britons already at the hotel, all Air Tour clients,
also accepted an offer to be moved elsewhere, although the Don Quixote
has now been given a clean bill of health.

Frankfurt, Thursday
A GERMAN court has approved 11 additional charges against Nick Leeson
in a formal extradition request from Singapore for the former Barings
Bank trader.
''All of the additional charges have been approved,'' said Frankfurt
prosecutor Hans-Hermann Eckert.
The 28-year-old Briton, who was detained at Frankfurt airport in
March, has been held in formal detention since a Frankfurt court
approved one of the dozen allegations in Singapore's request as being
sufficient for extradition.
Leeson, blamed for failed Japanese stock futures trading that led to
the collapse of his London-based bank in February, has said he will seek
to block extradition to Singapore where he worked.
He has been hoping for a rival extradition bid from Britain, but
authorities in London have so far not filed a request.
The Frankfurt regional state high court is expected to issue a final
ruling on the legal validity of Singapore's request in three to four
weeks.
Four of the allegations now approved by the court accuse Leeson of
ordering the transfer of #50m from a customer account to his own trading
account.
He then allegedly forged documents to create a fictitious deal with
the Wall Street firm Spear, Leeds and Kellogg in order to obtain funds
from the customer account.
Eckert said other charges approved by the court deal with the illegal
transfer of funds within Barings. Six charges cover allegations of fraud
committed by Leeson against Simex, the Singapore futures
exchange.--Reuter.

Charlottesville, Thursday
SUPERMAN actor Christopher Reeve was today sitting in a chair, eating
solid food and showing some movement for the first time since he was
paralysed in a riding accident 12 days ago.
''He is an ideal patient because he is eager to improve,'' said
neurologist Dr John Jane.
''There is new movement in Mr Reeve's right shoulder muscle,'' he
added.
A statement from the University of Virginia medical centre in
Charlottesville said doctors are pleased with his progress and his
health is improving although he remains in a serious condition.
Before a delicate operation on Monday, to fuse together two fractured
vertebrae at the base of his skull, Reeve had to lie flat putting him at
a high risk of life-threatening complications.
Reeve, 42, is still not able to breathe without a respirator.
The doctor said Reeve's rehabilitation depends on how much movement
returns.--AP.

LABOUR leaders have dismissed suggestions of regional or sector-based
minimum pay safeguards and yesterday made a categorical pledge to
introduce a statutory national minimum wage at a level to be determined
once Labour is in office.
There may be some form of London weighting and a lower minimum level
for younger workers, but these all will be finalised in talks with the
''social partners'' -- union and employer representatives -- when Labour
assumes power.
Launching Labour's Low Pay Campaign, Shadow Employment Secretary
Harriet Harman said that low pay currently was costing the taxpayer
#2.4bn a year with each individual tax payer paying #100 to subsidise
the low-pay employer
She said the Tories were using unemployment to drive down wages even
further even when, on the Government's own statistics, it was clear that
more than one million people earned less than #2.50 a hour and that
300,000 earned less than #1.50 a hour.
''The cost to the taxpayer of in-work benefits for people whose
employers will not pay them a proper wage is now #2.4bn in housing
benefit, family credit, council tax benefit and income support,'' she
said.
Labour recognised the important role of in-work benefits to top up
incomes for people with large families or high housing costs. However,
under the Tories, in-work benefits had become a subsidy for low-paying
employers topping up a bottomless pit of low wages.
In the clearest declaration of intent to date, Ms Harman emphasised
that ''in government, Labour will put a floor under wages with a
statutory minimum wage'' and emphasised that such legal protection would
not cost jobs. With this declaration, Labour hopes to persuade the
trades unions that it has no intention of backing off from its
commitment on a minimum even though it continues to ignore Labour Party,
TUC and individual union policies promoting a minimum based on a formula
of two thirds of median male earnings , currently #4.15 a hour.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo said last night: ''Labour's
attack on family credit means these families must now fear for the
future. Labour will put them out of work and cut their standard of
living.''
MEANS tests adversely affect the ''character, honesty and motivation''
of people who receive benefits, an all-party group of MPs warned
yesterday.
The Social Security Select Committee called for the Government to fund
new research into the way people become trapped in unemployment and
dependency.

Jerusalem, Thursday
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher began his thirteenth Middle
East peace mission today and said Israel-Syrian talks were on the
threshold of a new and important phase.
Also sounding hopeful, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told
reporters that he had received an encouraging phone call from US
President Bill Clinton about the prospects for peace with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
''President Clinton phoned yesterday . . . and described to me his
talks with President Assad and he conveyed to me his impressions of an
improved mood on the part of the Syrians,'' Rabin said after meeting
Christopher for about an hour.
Christopher said fresh momentum in Israel's negotiations with its Arab
neighbours had prompted a new mood.
''On the Syrian track,'' he said, ''I believe there is an opportunity
now to move into a new and important phase.''
Christopher confirmed that he, Rabin, and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak would meet in Cairo tomorrow.
Israel and Syria, which began slow-moving negotiations at a peace
conference in Madrid in 1991, have been deadlocked over the scope and
timing of an Israeli pull-out on the Golan Heights captured in the 1967
Middle East war.
The two sides agreed last month to send military experts to Washington
by the end of this month to discuss future security plans on the Golan.
On arrival, Christopher said it was essential for both sides to
accelerate the pace of talks if they were to make significant progress
before Israeli and US elections next year.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police, Mr Leslie Sharp, yesterday
formally announced his retirement, from December 31 this year, with a
side-swipe at Government funding.
He told members of the region's police and fire committee that the
''extreme seriousness'' of the current financial situation could be seen
from the cash available for building projects, maintenance, vehicles,
and various types of equipment.
If this was examined in relation to realistic capital requirements,
the extent of underfunding was disastrous.
''There really has been a breach of promise here,'' Mr Sharp said.
''There is a pitiful capital allocation.
''The depute chief constable is going to the Scottish Office to point
out our serious worries and I have been visiting the new unitary
authorities to explain the present situation. It looks as if things are
getting worse.''
Referring later to his impending retirement, Mr Sharp made it clear
there was no untoward reason this was being announced well in advance.
''There is no rancour towards this council,'' he said, ''and my time
here has been among the happiest years of my service. I had intended to
be here about five years but someone else has moved the goalposts,'' he
added.
''It still makes sense for someone to have time to get his, or her,
feet under the table and I, of course, still have six months' hard work
to do.''

THE Government yesterday decided its strategy for dealing with the
European issue -- which is dividing the Conservative Party -- at the
special ''political Cabinet'' after the formal one.
The Government's approach over the next two years or so to a General
Election is likely to be Euro-sceptical, but the anti-federalist
Ministers could not persuade their colleagues to go as far as pledging
that Britain would stay out of a single currency through the next
Parliament.
However, Mr Major struck a strong Euro-sceptical note in the Commons,
emphasising that the time might never be right for Britain to join the
single currency .
Meanwhile, the row within the party intensified with publication by a
study group, Action Centre for Europe, saying there was an overwhelming
economic case for Britain joining and it would be sidelined if it did
not.
Three Cabinet members -- Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster David Hunt and National Heritage Secretary Stephen
Dorrell -- are members of the group's governing council, but all made
clear they were not directly involved with the report.
Supporting it, the former Foreign Secretary, Lord Howe, said:
''Johnny-Come- Latelys never have much influence in shaping the bodies
they join. Britain should be thinking about this now.''
The former governor of the Bank of England, Lord Kingsdown (formerly
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton) said that delay in taking part in moves to a
single currency would repeat Britain's failure to join the EEC at its
inception and found the rules made for it.
However, former Chancellor Norman Lamont said a single currency would
lead inevitably to a single government and a single state in Europe.
Mr Lamont dodged questions about his possible role as a stalking horse
challenger to Mr Major for the Tory leadership in the autumn.
He three times sidesteped questions in a BBC Radio 4 interview,
calling them a red herring.
He then sought undertakings from other media representatives waiting
to interview him on Europe that they would not ask about the leadership.
However, he is again being considered a probable candidate.
In the Commons, the Prime Minister confirmed to Tory MP Barry Legge
that he would not support any proposals for the UK joining a timetable
for setting up single currency in the lifetime of this Parliament.
He said: ''I don't myself believe that the question of joining a
single currency will in practice arise for some time. Arguably the
circumstances may not ever be right.
Mr Major added that when the time came for a decision the Government
would need to consider not only the economic conditions but the
political and constitutional implications.''

THE tragic circumstances in which two of Aberdeen District Council's
most senior officials died during a twinning visit to Gomel in the
former Soviet Union were described yesterday by a councillor who had
accompanied them.
Councillor Margaret Smith, who has just returned from Gomel, told how
the accident happened at the end of a rest day during which they had
enjoyed a cruise and a barbecue was being prepared by their hosts.
She was part of a team looking at ways of helping Gomel, which is in
the area worst affected by the Chernobyl disaster, with its
environmental problems.
Also in the team were the two who died, Ms Ann Hughes, the council's
deputy chief executive, and Mr Iain McDonald, the principal
environmental health officer, who became a father for the second time
five weeks ago.
Communication difficulties have led to some confusion and Councillor
Smith said she wanted to clarify that this was nothing other than a
tragic accident.
She said: ''We were on the river, the scenery was beautiful, the sands
were lengthy. There were thousands of people out and the temperature was
80[DEG]F.
''The accident happened at around 8.30pm, when it was still light.
''The boat was at a small beach for a barbecue which the Gomel people,
after they had been swimming, started to prepare.
''At the end of a long, hot day it was beginning to get cool and we
were just sitting on the beach talking.
''Ann went in on her own and was swimming within 10-15 yards of the
beach. Ian said he was chilly and was reminded his clothes were on the
boat.
''He got up, went into the water and was swimming towards the boat. He
swam slightly towards Ann and seemed to speak to her and she started to
swim towards the boat. They converged about 5-10 yards away and that is
the last time I saw them.''
She added that five minutes later the boat engines started but it was
assumed the pair were on board.
It was not until the food was ready that it was discovered they were
missing.
Mrs Smith said they carried out a search and the police were
contacted.
They returned to their hotel and sat up all night hoping for a call.
However, it became clear they had drowned and on Tuesday morning Ms
Hughes' body was discovered.
Mr McDonald's body has now also been discovered and identified. It is
believed they died after being dragged under the cruiser.
Mrs Smith said a major investigation was being carried out by the
Gomel authorities.
''Their hosts were devastated and the whole of Gomel is mourning,''
she said. ''The police and officials of the city council and city
executive have been very sympathetic and helpful.''

Prime Minister today is set to launch a new Tory fightback against the
Labour Party, following a two-hour crisis session of the Cabinet
yesterday.
In a speech to the Welsh Tory conference, he will try to regain the
intitiative in the build-up to the next General Election.
With new opinion poll evidence showing the Government trailing well
behind Labour, Mr Major will emphasise the importance of the Union and
set out a number of key policy areas on which the Tories will fight
their campaign over the next two years.
After the ''political'' session of Cabinet yesterday, the Government
is set to concentrate on enterprise and prosperity, opportunity and
ownership, law and order, the standard of public service and the
sovereignty of the nation.
Tory sources said yesterday that the Cabinet spent almost all of the
session discussing the state of play and what could be done to rescue
Tory fortunes.
Almost every member of Cabinet was said to have pitched into a
wide-ranging discussion, which covered almost every aspect of Government
policy.
A Downing Street source said: ''Obviously now and again, one has to
change gear and this was viewed as the beginning of a discussion about
the specific policies we will put before the electorate in two years'
time.''
The spokesman said that the Cabinet was ''full of people who
understand the problems of the people out there, and who are detemrined
to address them.''
The new mood of Tory determination was reflected both in the exchanges
between Mr Major and Labour leader Tony Blair at Prime Minister's
Question Time and in a hard-hitting speech last night by Heritage
Secretary National Stephen Dorrell.
Mr Major went on the attack, both on the health service and on
taxation.
He asked one jeering Labour MP what he would say to the patients of
fundholders when the extra facilities provided by fundholding were lost,
and, on taxation, he said Labour could not have it both ways.
The Prime Minister told the House: ''They cannot criticise us week
after week over alleged tax increases and then say they would oppose tax
reductions as well.
''They had better make up their minds whether they are in favour of
high tax, low tax, or no tax -- or just taking every opportunity they
can on any issue to say whatever happens to be appropriate on the day
for a cheap short-term headline.''
Mr Dorrell, in what was arguably the strongest attack on Labour by a
Goverment Minister for years, tackled new Labour, old Labour,
devolution, the social chapter and the minimum wage.
Downing Street denied that Mr Dorrell was in any sense being put
forward as a trail-blazer, but his sentiments appeared to reflect the
mood of Cabinet.
Mr Dorrell said: ''It has become fashionable to argue that New Labour
is a break with the discredited past of the old Labour Party. It is said
that Mr Blair has won the fundamental battle for a new vision, and that
in the process he has secured future changes for his party. As a result
it is now safe for Conservatives to vote Labour.
''Every part of this argument is wrong. New Labour is not a break with
Labour's past, it is a return to it.''
On devolution, Mr Dorrell said: ''Throughout Labour's history,
constitutional reform has been toyed with when it was a politically
helpful distraction. Mr Blair's constitutional rationalism is entirely
in this tradition.
''Scottish devolution to keep his Scottish party sweet and help them
win votes from the Nationalists. Devolution everywhere else, so that his
Scottish proposals don't make him look silly on Newsnight.''
A new Gallup poll for the Telegraph shows the mountain the Governmant
has to climb. It gives Labour 59.5% of the vote, with the Conservatives
on 20%, a lead of 39.5%. The Liberal Democrats are on 14.5%, with other
parties on 6%.

PRISONERS are to be banned from taking part in radio phone-in
programmes following a nationwide broadcast in which convicted murderer
Jeremy Bamber (above) pleaded his innocence.
Home Office Minister of State Michael Forsyth, in a Commons written
reply last night, said he was taking immediate action.
He also disclosed that the Prison Service was considering introducing
equipment allowing prisoners access to approved telephone numbers only.
Bamber, 33, jailed for life for the murder of members of his family,
including six-year-old twins, told listeners to Talk Radio UK: ''I am
wholly innocent.''
The broadcast was condemned last night by Mr Forsyth. ''I do not think
it appropriate for prisoners to participate in radio phone-in
programmes.''
Bamber was convicted of shooting his adoptive parents, his
half-sister, Sheila,and her twin sons at Tolleshunt, Essex, after a
high-profile court case.
An appeal against his sentence was turned down.

THE recent revelation that counterfeit tea-bags contained sawdust and
wood shavings is not a new thing. The adulteration of food and drink has
been going on since time immemorial and is examined in some detail in my
recently-released book titled It's a Bad Thing Whisky, Especially BAD
WHISKY.
In Arthur Hill Hassall's 1876 work titled Food: Its Adulterations, and
the Methods For their Detection, he lists among the adulterants of tea
the following: exhausted tea-leaves, leaves of sycamore, horse-chestnut,
and plum, lie tea, paddy husk, sand, quartz, magnetic oxide or iron,
starch, gum, Chinese botanic powder, and a whole range of brightly
coloured dyes from rose pink to chrome yelloe and arsenite of copper.
Sugar was said to contain sand, plaster of Paris, powdered marble,
chalk, bonedust, and salt.
Whisky, that most wholesome of spirits whose debasement is little
written about, was at times a poisonous chemical cocktail which sent
many to an early grave. It might contain turpentine, sulphuric acid, or
a methylated spirits-based varnish which should only have been legally
utilised by hat makers and furniture polishers.
Of course the working classes in Victorian times were hard pushed to
find anything not tampered with by devious merchants, and we have to be
thankful today that the recent discovery is a once-in-a-blue-moon
affair.

THE recent incident of the counterfeit teabags in Strathclyde (Menace
of fakes mafia, June 8) underlines the concern the Scottish Consumer
Council has about the reorganisation of the trading standards
departments -- a concern we have already voiced on numerous occasions.
Small units will not have the resources to develop the highly-skilled
specialised teams which were able to uncover this particular example of
fraudulent and potentially harmful behaviour.
It will be very difficult indeed to sustain the expert teams which
have in the past protected consumers from such practices as illegal
money-lending, counterfeit goods, and unsafe products.
As the new authorities currently devise their strategies for the
delivery of services, it is of paramount importance that they give
priority to those services which protect consumer health and safety and
which allow consumers to operate with confidence in the marketplace.

A DIAGNOSIS of what is happening in the National Health Service at the
moment is peculiarly difficult. General Practitioners appear to be in
terminal dispute whereas nurses, recently at boiling point, seem to be
heading towards some sort of settlement. What we are seeing may be the
result of staff pressure, of Government guile, or of a collapse in the
souffle of change concocted by Mrs Bottomley and Mr Malone. It may even
be a combination of all of these factors, but the crucial question is
whether any of them will improve the service. The nurses appear to be
doing best at the moment, probably because their campaign has rattled
the Government and its wobbly Health Secretary. The drive to remove
national bargaining and funding of nurses' pay appears to have faltered
significantly. According to the latest information from the Department
of Health, the health trusts have been told that strings must not be
attached to pay offers. This appears to mean that nurses can expect the
3% pay rise which they have demanded, and that changes in working
patterns and cuts in holidays and other alterations must not be made.
Two things arise from this situation: central control of negotiations
appears to have been restored by the insistence on abandoning the
conditional strings, and the ability of some local trusts to pay for the
wage rise without money-saving strings must now be in doubt.
If the Government had set out to impose confusion on the NHS it could
have chosen no better route. Having diluted national bargaining Mrs
Bottomley appears to have conceded it by her direction to the health
trusts on strings. Mr Malone, as ever making the best of a lousy case,
says both nurses and the Government have moved and that the agreement by
the nurses' leaders to negotiate at local level is a victory for common
sense. Nurses do appear to have agreed to local negotiations, but
clearly on the understanding that it is for the current year and that
the effect is diminished by Mrs Bottomley's new willingness to tell the
trusts what to do. This will upset the other health unions and it would
be an unwise nurse who believes that, with the precedent for local
bargaining established this year, the Government will be willing to
revert to national bargaining next year.
The case of the GPs and their reluctance to work at night for what
they consider to be inadequate money might also be susceptible to
political guile.  Many GPs are adequately paid, but it is true that a
doctor who works all day, and who is then called out at night, is
probably not working well either day or night. Undoubtedly some
night-time calls can be frivolous, but there is no statistical evidence
as to what proportion of calls they constitute. Mr Malone has conceded
that GPs can assign after-hours cover to others. The funding of this is
one issue and the other, as we mentioned earlier, is whether services
will be improved by the results of all this haggling. At the moment, and
particularly as far as the bemused trusts must be concerned, this
question cannot be answered sensibly.

ALL of the controversy currently surrounding veal crates could be
repeated in the pig sector in four years time when a ban on sow stalls
and tethers becomes law, veterinary leaders claimed yesterday.
Mr Bob Stevenson, vice-president of the British Veterinary
Association, forecast that many pig farmers would go out of business
rather than adapt to the new regulations.
''The consequences which will flow from that will be increased imports
of pigmeat produced under systems which will then be banned in the UK,''
he said. The new situation would work to the detriment of the pig
farmer, the pigs and the consumer.
The stalls and tethers are designed to restrict mobility and to
prevent fighting between sows or the crushing of young piglets. Although
welfare organisations now campaign against them they were introduced as
a welfare measure to prevent deaths among young pigs.
The BVA, which has been working towards a European ban on veal crates,
will adopt a similar tack with the stall and tether ban in the hope of
avoiding the creation of another area in which the UK industry has to
meet a different set of criteria from those accepted in other European
Union states.
Mr Francis Anthony, a past-president of the BVA has recently been
elected president of the Federation of Veterinarians in Europe and the
BVA hope he will use his two-year term of office to tackle animal wefare
issues on a European-wide basis.
Speaking in Stirling where he was attending a veterinary training
course Mr Paul De Vile, president of the BVA, said he supported a recent
description of animal welfare as ''a British disease''.
The British animal welfare bodies could make a positive contribution,
he suggested, by helping to promote the welfare advantages of buying
British produced meat.
On the animal transport issue he re-affirmed the BVA's long-standing
policy that animals should be slaughtered as near to the point of
production as possible. Until Parliamaent or Europe changed the law,
however, it would be essential for vets to be involved in ensuring the
animals' health, welfare and fitness to travel, he said.
When animals were transported the conditions had to be right. That
meant they had to be in the right type of vehicle, with drivers trained
for the job of transporting livestock. If all of these areas were
addressed it would go a long way towards alleviating the transport
problem.
Dr Karl Linklater of the Scottish Agricultural College, a
vice-president of the association, said that a lot of research was going
on into the stresses of animal transport. It was sometimes forgotten, he
said, that the sheep was a ruminant animal which carried a good stock of
food with it. ''Most practical farmers know it isn't a good idea to
overfeed sheep before they are transported -- that creates more of a
welfare problem than if you hold back on the feeding a bit before a
journey.''

MORE than 100 new oilfields could be developed in the North Sea over
the next 15 years, according to an upbeat report published yesterday by
Grampian Regional Council, writes GRAEME SMITH.
The council's annual Update of Oil and Gas Prospects indicates that,
10 years from now, the industry could still be providing 40,000 jobs in
Grampian.
This the 16th such report by Grampian's Department of Economic
Development and Planning and is published days before the 20th
anniversary of the start of production with only one third of the known
oil reserves so far recovered and even less of the total gas reserves.
The report shows that 81 fields have now been developed, with a
further 17 due to come on stream over the next four years.
Although the number of offshore jobs is in decline, the number of
onshore jobs has not dropped in parallel. This is because of Aberdeen's
growing status as an energy centre and the continuing concentration of
functions in the city on the part of both operators and contractors.
In the past year, the number of oil-related jobs in Grampian has
dropped by 1500 to 46,500. By 2001, this may drop to 42,000 and then to
40,000 by 2006.
According to the report, oil and gas will remain the major power
source over the next quarter of a century.

AT LONG LAST the fightback has begun; hopefully it is not too late.
Britain's pro-Europeans, of whom there are considerable and surprising
numbers, have been a deplorably supine lot in recent months. The Tory
version has allowed itself to be blown over by the energetic huffing and
puffing of the sceptics, even though their behaviour inside the party
has demonstrated breathtaking arrogance and disloyalty. In the Labour
Party the pro-Europeans have allowed the leadership to make its genteel,
sensible, and infinitely cautious noises. Confrontation with Labour's
doubters is, of course, out of the question and the main victim has been
much-needed debate. Because it is the governing party and thereby
carries the possibility of doing the greatest harm to our national
future, the focus of the Euro debate has fallen inevitably on the
Tories. The technicolour antics of the antis have verged on the
repellent but they are well funded and their message has been effective.
Generally it has been transmitted in the most outrageous travesties of
the facts but it has been sad to see parliamentarians descending to
tabloid catch-phrases. All the scare stories have been there, most of
them alleging a European assault on our cherished traditions. Defend our
British banger; the pint is best; three-pin electrical plugs go in for
better conduct than the Euro model. Worst of all is the assertion,
unmisted by fact or proof, that our beloved sovereignty will be
surrendered to foreigners.
It is all so much noxious hot air, but it has seeped into the general
consciousness of many people. That is why the possibility of a
referendum on Europe is not a happy prospect, not because the people of
Britain are unfit to make a judgment on the issue, but because they have
been starved of a proper debate and fed largely on a diet of one-sided
claptrap produced by the alarmist and ultra-nationalist wing of British
politics. If the anti-Europeans are culpable in this, so are those in
favour. Within the Tory Party the cause of unity has been supreme, at
least on one side of the argument; Messrs Cash, Taylor, and Gorman are
less scrupulous. The result has been that those who see necessary
advantages for Britain's wholehearted involvement in Europe have been
silent for too long. An honourable mention should be made here for
British businessmen, many of whom, and particularly the exporters who
are leading what economic revival there is, can see the dangers of
British isolation from Europe. (We exclude from this the right-wing
Institute of Directors who believe that British participation in a
single European curency would damage the national interest.)
For all of these reasons it is heartening to see the influential
report from Lord Kingsdown and the Action Centre for Europe. A six-month
inquiry which listened to opinions from all sides has concluded that
Britain will face serious problems if it fails to join a single
currency. Much of the argument is technical, but Lord Kingsdown has had
the sense to elaborate on areas of interest to the ordinary citizen.
Thus he believes an opt-out could lead to homeowners as well as industry
paying higher interest rates. Jobs could be affected because of the loss
of job-creating investment from abroad, and this last point corresponds
with our own experience in Scotland. Recall the moment earlier this year
when Mr Major opened a Japanese factory in Scotland and asserted that it
was there because of the opportunities Britain offered; he was
contradicted immediately by the Japanese manager who said that it was
there because of the opportunities Britain offered within Europe.
Interestingly, the Action Centre for Europe has three Cabinet members on
its governing council. Kenneth Clarke, Stephen Dorrell, and David Hunt,
although not directly involved in this report, have nevertheless placed
themselves on the side of those who wish to prevent the Government from
adopting a dangerously negative manifesto commitment on the issue. It is
not wrong to have an open mind on the subject of the single currency,
but it is dangerous to have an allegedly open mind which appears to
drift at the behest of anti-European critics.

I READ with considerable interest your article on the findings of the
''National'' Rodent Survey, which as your article highlighted relates
only to England and Wales (May 7).
I am extremely concerned that no corresponding study has been carried
out in Scotland as I suspect the increase in rodent activity recorded
south of the Border would be mirrored in Scotland. However, I have no
way of knowing whether this is the case or not.
An obvious question is why did this exercise stop at the Border? I
contacted the Central Science Laboratory who suggested two possible
explanations.
First, that a similar study was carried out in England and Wales
during the 1970s and therefore this new study had some measured
statistical benefit. As Scotland was excluded from the 1970s survey no
measure for comparison existed. The logic of this explanation is that no
survey will ever be conducted in Scotland as no initial statistical base
exists .
The second explanation was more plausible -- that possibly the
Scottish Office has chosen not to become involved.
Irrespective of the reason, I would argue that such a survey must be
carried out as a matter of urgency. Your reliance in the article on
local government figures which showed little or no change ignores
completely the rapid growth of private-sector pest control in Scotland,
which has replaced local-authority control in many areas as a
consequence of Government cutbacks and client choice.
Despite running Scotland's largest independent pest control company, I
cannot say with certainty whether rodent numbers are of the increase or
decline. Like all private companies we spend a large amount of money
advertising and marketing. Any increase in our level of activity may
directly relate to that advertising rather than increased levels of
rodent activity. Similarly, no local authority can rely on their figures
without knowledge of private-sector figures over a similar period.
Given the amount of fear and damage rodents cause, plus the dangers to
health associated with rats and mice, it is folly indeed to exclude
Scotland from this valuable study.
I have spoken with several of the sponsors of the survey in England
and Wales and they, like our company, would be prepared to help fund a
similar study in Scotland. The question is, will the Government through
the Scottish Office do anything about it?

IT should not go unnoticed that the leaders of the four new unitary
councils in Lothian are proposing to make the new single-tier unitary
authorities a two-tier system by the back door. The joint liaison
committee of the four unitary councils are, on the basis of Frances
Horsburgh's article (June 5), going to provide major local government
services through joint arrangements, thus creating a two-tier system.
This new system of local government requiring joint arrangements for
the provision of major public services is of course what the Secretary
of State for Scotland hoped for, since anyone reading the Local
Government (Scotland) Act, 1994, will realise the power the Secretary of
State enjoys over the joint arrangements between local authorities.
Centralising power in the Secretary of State's hands has been the
hidden agenda the Government have been working to throughout the
reorganisation of local government at the price of local authority
accountability.
The joint arrangements for discharging local authority services means
that should any member of the public seek to complain about a particular
service provided by joint arrangement they will find that many members
of the joint committees are councillors for a neighbouring local
authority, or indeed may not even be elected politicians, and thus are
not accountable to the electorate of a given unitary authority area.
Put simply, should two or more councils decide to carry out a wide
range of functions jointly they may risk blurring rather than clarifying
accountability.
When Ian Lang claimed that local government would be transformed he
was right -- it has been transformed, but for the worse. Local
government needed this reorganisation like a hole in the head.

HERE'S the good news: British Telecom will only charge you for the
actual time you spend on the phone. The bad news: not if you use a pay
phone.
As most reports overlooked, but Anne Johnstone indicated in her
feature (June 1), pay phones will continue to charge at 10p per ''unit''
(unspecified). That means those most likely to depend on a callbox,
because they cannot afford a phone, pay more. Mercury manages to charge
for the time used, but has few telephones outside metro areas.
The people to whom pennies actually matter lose them, when they could
remain on a phonecard or be carried forward to another call, as
''units'' are.
Is this good, or even legal, business? If payment for The Herald were
to be accepted only in #1 units . . .

YOUR editorial was right to say (June 6) that the GMB general
secretary, John Edmonds', ''fairness not favours'' speech was ''really
looking forward to the next Labour Government''.
Is it any wonder we look to the future? We've had more than enough --
16 years more than enough -- of the Tories' unfairness towards ordinary
people and their favours to the city, the boardrooms, and the rich.
And one unfairness we want the next Labour Government to end is the
Tories' denial of a basic human and democratic right: the right of every
employee to be a member of a trade union and for that union to represent
them before an employer.
This is enshrined in Conventions No 87 and 98 of the Geneva-based
International Labour Organisation. No wonder, therefore, at the same
time as Mr Edmonds was on his feet in Brighton, Michael Portillo was
threatening to withdraw UK from the ILO. Mr Portillo was peeved at the
possibility of the ILO's summer conference condemning the Conservative
Government for outlawing trade unions at the GCHQ spy centre in
Cheltenham.
If the Tories could have got away with it they'd have outlawed unions
from every workplace. As it happens their scores of anti-union measures
have helped too many bad employers to do just that.
But the mood is changing and yes the unions are looking to the future.
And we'll be campaigning hard to ensure that international obligations
-- such as the ILO conventions -- are no longer ignored by the British
Government.

YOUR report regarding the British Gas memo to shareholders on their
recent meeting indicates that the 4300 shareholders who voted against
Chief Executive Cedric Brown's reappointments represent only 2.3% of the
total number of shareholders in the company (June 6).
The company, for obvious reasons, implies that the remaining 97.7%
(approximately 200,000) of shareholders were in favour of the
reappointment.
A more logical representation would confirm that only a few hundred
people -- the directors of those institutions who held the bulk of votes
as proxies -- were in favour of retaining Mr Brown. Those shareholders
who passed their proxy votes to the directors were however, I suggest,
not expressing support for Mr Brown but a ''don't know, don't care'' or
simply neutral position.
Thus it can be argued that there were vastly more shareholders (2300)
who were against the reappointment of Mr Brown than the number of
institution directors who were in favour.
The only morally correct outcome of this vote would have been the
resignation of Mr Brown.

COMPANIES, particularly in the dairy sector, need to polish up their
act on innovation and marketing, the Agriculture Minister, William
Waldegrave, said yesterday.
He told delegates to the annual Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (Adas) food and drink industry conference in London that while
adding value was the name of the game, many projects received by the
Ministry for grant backing failed to achieve this.
''It is notable that some sectors seem to be able to put forward
higher quality projects than others. I am pleased that we have been able
to assist 10 meat-industry projects to the tune of #2.5m.
''Equally, I am disappointed that we have been able to help only two
really good dairy industry projects. New product development is
particularly needed to make the most of our limited quota and I should
like to see more innovative applications from this sector.''
He revealed that a further 40 companies were being short-listed for
over #8m in grants in the latest round of the Ministry-backed processing
and marketing grants scheme. This brought the total for the year so far
to #13m for 62 businesses.
Urging closer partnerships throughout the food chain, Mr Waldegrave
said: ''In business today, particularly when the food industry is so
competitive, supply partnerships are a way of developing business by
serving the consumer better -- a way to cut costs, to improve service
and to innovate through shared ideas and experience.''
There were key opportunities in the export field through closer
linkages, he added.
Dr Julia Walsh, Adas chief executive, said she was often struck by the
isolated way in which many of the consumer and legislative challenges
were tackled.
She explained: ''Nearly 50 years of consultancy experience has taught
us the importance of integrating new developments in technology and
management effectively into the business as a whole rather than dealing
with issues as seemingly unrelated projects.''

FURTHER to Carole Woddis's elegant and informative review of the
Riverside production of The Fire Raisers (June 1), I wonder how many of
your readers recall that this important play was staged at the Citizens'
in 1962 -- the first complete staging in Britain, as the Royal Court
Theatre in London had omitted the controversial final act in its
production the previous year.
The Citizens' director, the splendid Callum Mill, with a typically
adventurous gesture, engaged Jack Radcliffe and Helen Norman, deservedly
popular favourites of the Glasgow variety stage, to play the unfortunate
Biedermanns.
They rose to the challenge with true gallantry, although some of their
admirers were puzzled to find them in such unfamiliar surroundings!

AS an eminent schoolboy enthusiast of the London trams in the 1920s
and a wartime enthusiast of Glasgow's trams in the 1940s, I cannot let
Hugh N McAulay's letter (June 3) pass unchallenged.
I don't know where Guinness Books or the late Charles S Dunbar got
their facts but according to Nelson's Encyclopaedia (Vol 22) published
by Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons in Edinburgh in 1916 (based on a Harmsworth
Encyclopaedia issued in fortnightly parts in 1905 but updated and
revised):
''James Outram, an engineer and iron master, advising the Duke of
Norfolk in 1775, pulled up the the wooden rails then in common use at
the duke's colliery at Sheffield, and laid down L-shaped cast-iron
rails, spiked to cross sleepers. The first Outram plates were laid in
1776, and the line became known as 'Outram's way'.
''No sooner was it found that Outram's way required fewer horses and
men than the drivers got up a riot, tore up the plates and burned the
sleepers. Ultimately James Outram's son, Benjamin, substituted for iron
sleepers solid blocks of stone.
''These Outram ways were soon laid down all over the country. In
course of time the first two letters of the name were omitted and the
word 'tramway' was evolved.
''The tramway proper for passengers traffic on the streets was first
adopted in America in 1832, from New York to Harlem.''
Since Nelson and Harmsworth pre-dated both Guiness and Dunbar, I see
no reason to contradict John MacCalman's version.

THE appointment of Philip Oppenheim as denouncer-in-chief of a
national minimum wage seems a little unfortunate. When central casting
was handing out facial features, they equipped Mr Oppenheim only for the
role of pantomime villain.
This does not make him the ideal figure to defend the sacred principle
that employers are entitled to pay as little as they can get away with.
For over one million, that means less than #2.50 an hour, while for
300,000 poor souls the rate for the job is under #1.50.
Incidentally, Mr Oppenheim's mummy, Sally of that prosperous ilk, is a
former Tory MP much given to berating the wickedness of trade unions. As
she prated on about events ''on the shopfloor'', Willie Hamilton
famously responded that the only shopfloor she knew anything about was
the one at Fortnum and Mason's.
Listening yesterday to Mr Oppenheim's claims that a national minimum
wage represents a dire threat to the British economy, I had the distinct
feeling that this is another argument which they have comprehensively
lost. As a bogeyman, Portillo's apprentice frightens few.
Partly this is a by-product of public reaction to Cedric and his
Trough, and similar parables on how the rich have been licensed to make
themselves phenomenally richer. How can any reasonable person equate
that side of the Tory pay coin with resistance to a minimum level of
decency?
Perhaps the best recent guide to public opinion was the campaign
which, against all odds, saved the Agricultural Wages Board. A very wide
range of people in rural communities, not themselves affected by low
pay, were offended by the idea that the low-paid farm workers were to be
robbed of their modest legal protection. The Tories backed off.
It's just a pity the same kind of campaign could not have succeeded in
defence of the wages councils. Nobody who glances at the vacancies in
Job Centres can be in any doubt that the effect of that piece of malice
has been to drive down wages at the lowest end of the market. There is
no evidence that it has created more demand for this even cheaper
labour.
I think a lot of employers have recognised that a national minimum
wage is going to happen and are looking on the positive side. Several of
the big supermarket chains, for instance, pay above any likely statutory
figure without noticeable impact on their profits. So why should they
join the Tories in clamouring against it?
On the contrary, their vested interest is surely in supporting a
measure which will remove the cost advantage enjoyed by their less
scrupulous competitors who pay disgracefully and unnecessarily low
wages. It is also occurring to more and more former opponents that the
low-paid are also consumers, who are likely to spend their pay
increases.
There is also an increasing body of information from other countries,
which Mr Oppenheim has been particularly active in trying to rubbish,
that a national minimum wage on balance creates jobs rather than
destroys them. That seems logical, when you think about it, if there is
more money circulating.
Really, the rump of opposition is composed of those who deserve no
sympathy -- the exploiters of cheap labour in a climate of sustained
mass unemployment. If that is the flag which the Tories wish to rally
round in the run-up to a General Election, then they are welcome to it.
I don't see it is a great popular cause.
As the Labour Party pointed out yesterday, the continuing plague of
low pay is not a cost-free option for the taxpayer. It costs #2400m per
year in benefits -- #220m of it in Scotland -- to supplement the
earnings of people who are in work through Family Credit, Income
Support, and Housing Benefit.
The Government has just removed the Social Security safety net from
homeowners who lose their jobs or are otherwise unable to keep up
mortgage payments. When challenged on this yesterday, Mr Major took the
line that it was not up to the taxpayer to fund this form of
underwriting. Why not apply the same principle to low pay?
I would have thought that preventing families from having their homes
repossessed is a much more useful form of social expenditure than giving
a free ride to bad employers; many of whom use the existence of Family
Credit quite cynically as an excuse for paying pittances.
Mr Oppenheim's other line of attack was to demand that Labour should
name a figure. That is a matter of legitimate concern to supporters of
the policy, and will be determined at the proper time. However, nobody
who opposes the setting of any figure has a right to participate in the
discussion about what the figure should be.
I believe that establishing the principle is infinitely more important
than choosing a figure. For it will be one of the landmark social
reforms of the century and while the Tories may loathe it, they will
never dare abolish it.
And now, briefly, for something completely different. I hope to be
reading my Herald this morning in Fort William, having travelled north
by sleeper before taking the West Highland Line to Mallaig.
It is the great railway journey which Messrs Mawhinney, Salmon, Ellis,
et al, intended that neither I nor anyone else would ever make again. I
revel in their humiliation and am fortified for the remainder of the
fight which lies ahead.

WHILE it is encouraging to note the success of the police in recent
years in their efforts to improve efficiency and their achievements in
the investigation of crimes, which has resulted in a substantial rise in
clear-up rates, it is nevertheless disappointing to note the comments
made by Chief Constable Ian Oliver of Grampian Police following
criticism of his force's performance by HM Chief Inspector of
Constabulary for Scotland, Mr John Boyd (June 2).
Mr Oliver's comment, ''It should be understood that Scottish forces
currently use different methods of recording reported crimes'' as
justification of his force's difference in performance, is misleading.
He appears to have decided to disregard the existence of the Scottish
Criminal Statistics Committee which comprises representatives of the
Scottish Home and Health Department and all police forces in Scotland,
including Grampian, who meet on a regular basis and have as one of their
main aims ongoing examination in order to ensure uniformity of recording
practice throughout the whole of Scotland.
Over the years much deliberation and commitment has been shown by this
committee in ensuring that the necessary statistics, as required by the
Secretary of State, are maintained and collated in a uniform and
accurate manner in order that they can be used with confidence when
necessary to assist in such areas as the proper allocation of workloads,
distribution of manpower, manpower strength, etc, both by individual
forces and by other agencies such as the HMIs Department and the
Scottish Office.
Most forms of statistics and in particular police crime statistics
attract a certain amount of scepticism and it obviously does not assist
in promoting their credibility when comments such as these are made by
one of the most senior officers in the Scottish Police Service.

With a remarkable German connection established with Glasgow bands,
David Belcher speaks to Chris Thomson of the Bathers.
IF he tires of sitting in his living-room thumbing through the pages
of the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung, Chris Thomson can always gaze
out of the window at the grey tin hut which is the SECC. Sadly, Chris
has yet to secure the widespread public acclaim which would grant him a
gig at the venue which looms large across the road from his flat, but at
least he is well thought of in Germany, hence the presence of the
newspaper.
As has been well documented, Chris and his band, the Bathers, are at
the forefront of a remarkable Scottish-German stable of bands. The
Marina label, based in Hamburg and run by two enthusiastic German
music-journos, currently has four Glasgow bands on its books.
Marina's most recent album release was the Bathers' swoonsome
Sunpowder, hailed as a four-star corker by Q magazine, who moreover
hymned it as ''gorgeous . . . inhabiting the same honey-spun, abstract
turf as Van Morrison, Tom Waits, and Tim Buckley''. This verdict is more
right than wrong, although Q did rather spoil things by introducing an
extraneous ''p'' into the middle of Chris's surname.
Let me spell things out: what really matters is that you rush out and
discover the album for yourself. Additionally, there will be a few
chances in the coming months for you to experience the Bathers live. In
July, Chris and his cohorts will be undertaking three dates supported by
their equally fabulous Marina label-mates Sugartown. In August, there's
a Bathers' show at Glasgow's Mitchell Theatre.
All this performing activity follows the successful series of informal
Sunday-night Marina showcases which took place at the Tramway in March,
featuring the Bathers, Sugartown, and Cowboy Mouth. ''Shared billing
took the pressure off,'' says Chris in a speaking voice as plain as his
singing voice is heroic, mannered, and baroque.
''Everything felt pleasantly relaxed, almost as though we could have
chanted a mantra for 15 minutes and the audience would have let us away
with it . . . not that it was something we ever considered. But we
didn't have to rehearse enormously beforehand, and consequently we were
able to bring the music down almost to a stop, and get very quiet in
front of a warm, supportive audience . . . and that notion of light and
shade is something that works very well for us.
''When I started off with Friends Again, I always knew what I wanted
to do musically, but everything seemed to go too fast.''
And what did you want to do? What is your present aim?
''It looks terribly pretentious in print, for which I apologise in
advance, but there's no other way to put it . . . it's about freezing
some of life's moments of magic and mystery in your music. It's about
creating moments that have nothing to do with us as musicians anymore.
On tape, you sometimes get something that goes beyond all your
limitations as frail humans in a pop combo.
''It's about aiming for transcendence, which again might read as
highly pretentious, but that's what it amounts to, for the audience and
for us as players.''
And thus your voice is a cathedral, I hear myself gasping, against my
better judgment. Chris looks at me askance. He's not that pretentious,
dear reader, fear not.
Of course, you can make this kind of statement only from a position of
strength, ie if you've got a good band. Chris does. The two Bathers' LPs
to date have utilised a sympathetic bunch of skilled musos. Iain White
and Mark Wilson on strings; Carlo Scattini on keyboards; drummer Hazel
Morrison, and Love and Money frontman James Grant on guitar. Cocteau
Twin Liz Fraser is a notable guest vocal presence on four of Sunpowder's
tracks, too, having been overcome -- in common with elfin Icelander
Bjork, apparently -- by a chance listen to the previous Bathers' album,
Lagoon Blues.
Chris's live band is likely to be based on the quartet of White,
Wilson, Scattini, and Morrison. Liz Fraser, exiled in London, will be
unavailable, as will local axe hero James Grant, who is currently busy
crafting a film soundtrack for The Near Room, the forthcoming
Scottish-made movie directed by and starring David Hayman, and
co-starring Adrian Dunbar.
''James made a big vocal contribution to the first Bathers' album,
back in 1986, but we haven't recorded together since. Not since we were
both in Friends Again over a decade ago. I had a very difficult period
when Love and Money were on their upward trajectory, to be honest.
''I lost all that I'd had in Friends Again with one phone call from
James and the classic words: 'I've got something heavy to lay on you,
man.' And then he told me that he was leaving Friends Again, and he was
going to be the singer with his own band -- but everyone in Friends
Again was leaving with him to be in his band as well. It was like
something straight out of Spinal Tap!''
Fortunately, the Friends Again duo were soon friends again, and remain
so to this day. ''I only regret the fact that we didn't squeeze two LPs
into our time together. But neither of us could have made the records we
have made if we'd stayed in the Friends Again set-up.
''For example, Sweet Deceit, the second Bathers' album, was about
exorcising demons and placing no limits on my self-indulgence, but
thereafter each LP has become more accessible. Sunpowder is more
tuneful; its vocal treatments are less extreme.
''Then again, I'm often sobered when I meet Scots in their late
twenties who love music, but have never heard of the Bathers. It takes a
lot to filter through to peoples' consciousnesses.''
Chris Thomson and the Bathers: in plain English, they're very special.
* The Bathers and Sugartown will be playing in Edinburgh at La Belle
Angele on July 21; Aberdeen's Lemon Tree on July 23, and at the Garage,
Glasgow, on July 24.

MIRANDA TUFNELL is not disposed to be a townie. City life, city
rhythms, don't inspire her. Time, she finds, ''scuttles away in
cities''. For her, time moves at a more meaningful pace in the country
setting where she lives.
Even a short conversation about her work -- she can be seen at the
Traverse on Sunday -- leads swiftly into thoughtful discussions on how
we can retrieve our natural selves from the scrum and pressures of
modern life.
Tufnell has a particularly close understanding of what stress and
fast-lane priorities can do to the human body. Her training in Alexander
Technique -- with its focus on posture and equilibrium, mental as well
as physical -- is not only a significant force within her dance-making,
it's a resource that's nowadays called upon by her local NHS.
She often sees people who have been involved in car crashes.
Essentially what she does, when she treats them, is to reconnect them
with their inner voice. It can be, on a simple level, just realising
that a certain kind of shoe throws the whole body out of balance; or
that collapsing into a squashy chair isn't really relaxing if it leaves
you with a grizzling spine.
The real challenge comes, however, when that inner voice starts
objecting to the mission statements of our present culture. It's then --
and Tufnell has watched this time and again -- that people begin to
realise what has been lost to them in the rapid turnover of apparent
progress.
Tufnell herself is very clear on what that loss encompasses. ''We've
tended to dismiss the spirit world from our lives. And we've shut
ourselves off from ways of listening and hearing that would keep us in
tune with those images. We've lost a whole realm of awareness.'' It's
that realm of awareness which is at the heart of her new work, Invisible
Forces of Silver.
The title is from a Ben Okri poem, Lament of the Images, that conjures
a vision of talismanic objects being destroyed and taking with them a
people's litany of belief, as well as their power of imagination. For
Tufnell, the poem resonated with familiar concerns. These she shared
with her long-time collaborator, musician Sylvia Hallet, and artist
Caroline Lee.
They gathered together, in her house on the edge of the Fells, and
while Tufnell and Hallet explored sounds and rhythms, Lee started
creating sculptures out of willow and copper. It's at this point that
you realise the work just wouldn't happen if Tufnell lived in a city,
for she draws on all the elemental forces round about her -- the way in
which time presents itself through changing light, through seasons,
through new growth and falling leaves, through ''the arrival, every
spring, of a sparrowhawk that always takes some of my doves. That
suddenness, that death, which is also part of nature, a part we often
try to ignore.''
* Miranda Tufnell opens up Timeless Images at Edinburgh's Traverse on
Sunday 8pm when she gives a performance of Invisible Forces of Silver.

THE leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace,
discovered yesterday that his newly bought second-hand Land Rover
Discovery had been stolen in England weeks earlier. The MP for Orkney
and Shetland, who is also a QC, was informed by police at his Orkney
home.
He said: ''We hope the police manage to nail the perpetrator of what
seems to be a very clever scam.'' The MP bought the car through a
legitimate dealer who was fully insured and would be refunding his
money.

YET another ensemble made its debut yesterday, though the components
are well-known. Russian violist Lev Atlas is a section principal in the
Scottish Opera Orchestra; American pianist Phillip Silver is a
well-known figure in a variety of contexts. Together, they also form
two-thirds of the Rachmaninov Trio, founded a little over a year ago and
already well-established on the local scene.
I recall that one of the first comments I made about the latter group
was that, so unified was the ensemble, it appeared to have been born
fully formed. Likewise with the Atlas-Silver duo in its first
performance yesterday. There's a sense of ease between the two players
that speaks of their experience of playing together (even allowing for
the odd technical slips that are part and parcel of live performance).
The problem that must exist for a viola-piano duo is the question of
original repertoire. Yesterday, music more commonly associated with the
cello found itself being lifted (and uplifted -- literally, by an
octave) as Schubert and Brahms were brought into service for the
recital. In Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata, Lev Atlas revealed a great
deal about his style. He is a player of great poise and grace. Arguably
the Arpeggione needs a more buccaneering style, though Atlas's deeply
serious and eloquent approach set its own context.
This approach also characterised the duo's performance of Brahms's F
Minor Sonata, where the normal rhetoric was replaced by a composed
attitude that -- in the slow movement -- provided memorable playing of
an almost serene quality.
In between, the duo -- proving that they can dispense panache --
played Enescu's rhapsodic Concertstucke with considerable elan.

Another night, another town, another batch of miracles for the
hallelujah roadshow. Kirsty Scott meets the man behind the happening.
THE WOMAN stands transfixed, mouth opening and closing like a
goldfish, one hand clutching her stomach, the other waving wildly above
her head. Around her, rows of bodies sway and shake, arms and faces
uplifted to the rafters.
On the stage, Morris Cerullo stops his pacing and lifts his Bible high
in the air. His eyes squeeze shut. ''Somebody -- a woman -- has been
healed of a tumour. Oh! Ah! Yeah! Oh, my God! You have had a growth in
your breast. Just put your hand where the growth was and you will find
that it's totally disappeared.'' A hail of hallelujahs echo round
Glasgow's City Hall and a deep groan floats down from the balcony area.
Cerullo, warming to his theme, opens his eyes and surveys the tumult
before him. The first beads of sweat are starting to form on his
forehead under the stiff side-slicked fringe.
''There are 16 people that have been healed of asthma, of breathing
conditions, three people have been healed in their lungs,'' his voice
breaks and wavers. ''I have no control over what's happening in this
building . . . God we give you praise. Someone just got a healing for a
heart condition, an incurable heart condition . . . somebody's bad ear
just popped open . . . give Him praise. It's happening.''
It had taken a while. Even by British standards the 1000-strong
Glasgow audience was, initially, a little reserved; pinned to their
seats by propriety, discomfiture dimming their praises to faint amens.
Even the American evangelist's warm-up men had a hard time, raising
only a few half-hearted hallelujahs at the promise of two of Cerullo's
books for a one-time-only deal of #5.
When he finally appeared from the wings in a huddle of security men,
Cerullo worked the audience like a pro. He's been doing it for 45 years
now, taking the Morris Cerullo World Evangelism roadshow around the
world and back again.
He says God wants him to save one billion people by the turn of the
century and he notched up two more in Glasgow on Wednesday night. They
were drug addicts, they said. Young, with freshly pressed jeans, they'd
pushed their way through the throng of people called to the stage to
reveal how they had been healed. Cerullo tilted the microphone towards
them.
''We were brought here by a friend,'' said the first one. ''He brings
some good into Renfrew. He stops drugs and different things. I've tried
every type of drug.''
The microphone is nudged towards the second youth. He shuffles his
feet. ''I've tried a few myself,'' he says finally.
Once they've both expressed their newfound love for Jesus, Cerullo
thrusts his palm at their foreheads and they collapse backwards into the
arms of the security men who lay them side by side on the stage where
they stay for the rest of the service. The crowd erupts and Cerullo
staggers back, as though it was all too much for him, and the tears
come. Again.
There are bodies all around him. Middle-aged men in suits and ties,
women with tidy hair and comfortable shoes, teenagers, all laid in neat
rows on and in front of the stage. One young woman in a bright summer
dress rocks back and forward on her heels murmuring unintelligible
phrases.
''It's like warm liquid fire,'' Cerullo whispers into the microphone.
''Praise Him for your healing . . . there are so many miracles
happening, so many healings taking place.''
What with the drug addicts and all, he didn't seem to get round to
speaking to all those who had been healed, so it's a natural question to
put to him the following morning in a chaperoned interview in his
city-centre hotel. How can he prove that two hours of prayer and
rhetoric in a draughty hall can salve a pinched nerve or cure that
unseeing eye?
Cerullo sighs deeply. ''I don't think it's our job to try to answer
the critics. Jesus certainly didn't do it. He just went on and continued
to do the things that he was sent here to do.'' He says he has had
doctors, ''good Christian doctors'', attest to the fact that people got
healed.
He looks smaller than he did on stage. He can't be much over 5ft 2in
but he has presence. Maybe it's the dapper outfits; last night a sharp
two-piece, today a silk bomber jacket and sleek suede shoes. Most likely
it's the fact that he is always surrounded by people -- pretty large
people -- in beefy black suits.
Glasgow is his first stop on a six-city British tour, before his
annual Mission to London in August. In the next 90 days he will be on
three continents, in three countries and 32 cities. It's a killer pace
for a 63-year-old. ''It's taxing, very taxing,'' he says. ''It's a
supernatural manifestation that's taking place and it goes through our
physical bodies.''
The Glasgow audience, he insists, were as welcoming and willing to
participate as any you might find on the buckle of America's Bible Belt.
''They were very wonderful, very warm and very precious and I really
look forward to coming back.'' He's been here once before, 12 years ago.
He thinks it was Dundee.
Morris Cerullo World Evangelism (MCWE), with its base in San Diego, is
a multi-million dollar enterprise with a 24-hour Christian satellite TV
network across America, a school of ministry, a theme park and regular
crusades.
It's a secular world away from the poor New Jersey home where Cerullo
was born before being packed off to an Orthodox Jewish orphanage at the
age of two by a drunken father. At the age of eight he tried to commit
suicide and at the age of 14 he was called upon by God.
He's watched his ministry grow in leaps and bounds and believes the
momentum will continue both here and in America as more and more people
become disenchanted with life's moral vacuum. In America, evangelism has
become the biggest single constituency in the Republican Party. It is
clearly a political force.
He is a disconcerting interviewee, talking about himself in the third
person -- ''Brother Cerullo says . . .'', ''If you get to know Morris .
. .''.
He has pretty much accepted the term ''controversial'' as a moniker,
including it in his own PR blurb, and few of his initiatives have been
as controversial as the recent Miracle of Debt Cancellation Programme.
The scheme involved followers sending cash in return for Cerullo's
prayers that they will be freed from their debts.
''Is Morris still preaching that God can help you get out of debt
financially?'' he says, when prodded about the programme. ''The answer
is yes. I believe that . . . The Bible says you give and God will give
back to you.'' Then there's a little speech about Jesus having debts and
God cancelling debts in the Old Testament.
''Our responsiblity is to have the work that we do done with absolute
integrity,'' he says. ''I come here. I pay my own way here . . . I do
not get one penny on salary, not one penny in love offering. I don't
want to get up and tout that stuff, but since you asked for it those are
the facts.''
Back at the meeting, they got the messy business of money out of the
way before Cerullo had reached the stage. There were plastic bins at the
end of every row and one of the warm-up men urged the crowd to dig deep
in the name of the Lord.
''Do you know that Jesus looks in the offering basket? Well, how did
he know that the widow only had two mites?'' said the man. ''Spirit of
the Lord quicken our conscience to decide what to give. Speak into each
heart now the sum.'' He develops the theme, then pauses for a moment, as
if reluctant to break the mood. ''Cheques,'' he added, ''should be made
payable to MCWE.''

RESIDENTS of a caravan site will have their electricity supply
restored today. The Silverbirch site at Dalrymple, Ayrshire, has been at
the centre of controversy as the owner wants to sell it for housing and
is trying to evict six remaining mobile-home owners.
The supply was cut off this week at the request of the owner but
ScottishPower has installed an emergency supply. The company stepped in
after learning two residents needed power for nebulisers to treat chest
complaints.

After the rescue of fighter pilot Scott O'Grady, Patrick Brogan
measures the impact of the operation in the United States.
SCOTT O'Grady will be brought home to a hero's welcome over the
weekend. President Clinton, the armed forces, and Americans generally
are elated at the rescue and will hang out the bunting for him. His home
is in Spokane, in Washington state in the far north-west and his
parents, his brother, and sisters were all on television this morning
bubbling with relief and delight.
It helps that O'Grady is young, good-looking, and a fighter pilot, the
very image of a clean-cut American hero. His bravery and resourcefulness
may do something to balance the image of that other famous American
military man, crew-cut, slim, steely eyed Tim McVeigh, decorated veteran
of the US Army in the Gulf, who allegedly declared war on the United
States and blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City.
O'Grady is one of that small elite of the US armed forces, the sort of
hero every little boy wants to grow up to be. It is a particular delight
that he seems to have coped with his predicament, shot down at 16,000ft
over enemy territory, with such skill and elan, living on insects,
berries, and rainwater before his rescue.
McVeigh is apparently obsessed with fantasies of government evil and
with paranoid suspicions of everyone and everything.
O'Grady is the boy next door, and now a hero.
Things have not been going well for the UN, Nato, or the US in Bosnia.
All were defied and humiliated by Serbian thugs led by a gangster in a
comic opera uniform, General Mladic, and a wild-haired and voluble
shrink, Radovan Karadzic.
The taking of hostages, with film of French, British, and Canadian
soldiers chained to railings, was the most embarrassing public
humiliation Western nations have suffered since British Marines were
forced to lie on their faces on the ground by the Argentinian invaders
of the Falklands, or since American diplomats in Teheran were shown
blindfold and bound to a howling mob in Teheran.
The Americans were brought into the general debacle when one of their
F-16s was shot down over Bihac a week ago and the pilot lost. At least
the Americans were spared the spectacle of a prisoner captured and
paraded on Belgrade television.
Now he has been rescued, and there is an immediate and palpable
lifting of public spirits here. President Clinton said yesterday that
the whole country is full of pride and gratitude, and asserted the
incident proves that ''We have the finest armed forces in the world. We
are proud of them and ecstatically glad''.
The egregious CNN, the main ''all-news'' channel, as usual devoted
most of its air time yesterday morning to chat shows with female
commentators, to Hollywood gossip, and to its own self-promotion, in
preparation for its regular daily diet of O J Simpson. That event,
fortuitously, was delayed for a few minutes, allowing the network to
broadcast extracts of O'Grady's mother's press conference and the
President's speech.
But CNN, at least in its domestic version, has long since given up its
original mission to provide hard news: in the terms of the trade, it has
gone soft. The other networks did a far better job, breaking into their
usual soap operas this morning with live broadcasts of press conferences
and official statements, and they all started the day with long reports
from Bosnia, London, and Washington on the rescue.
Now comes the post-game analysis, as they say of sporting events.
First of all, this is a reminder that the Americans, and Nato, still
wield enormous military force.
The Marines went in to the rescue with two large helicopters,
accompanied by fighters, AWACs, and ground-attack planes -- 40 planes in
all. As Admiral Leighton Smith, the American commander of Nato forces in
Southern Europe said this morning, ''We had the whole shooting match up
there.''
William Perry, the Secretary for Defence, who is in Brussels for a
Nato meeting, said that the rescue is a model for future operations to
bring out UN personnel trapped in the various besieged pockets of
government territory in Bosnia, such as Goradze and Srebrenica.
The first clear communications with Captain O'Grady on the ground were
established in the middle of the night: within two hours, the armada was
in the air, arriving at his hiding place at daybreak.
A second point is the role of luck in human affairs. Captain O'Grady
was carried off to the medical unit on the USS Kearsarge, the helicopter
carrier in the Adriatic from which the rescue was launched. He has yet
to emerge to give a detailed account of his ordeal, but it is clear that
he was very fortunate to escape Serb efforts to capture him.
The US Air Force was lucky that O'Grady came from the mountains of
Washington, rather than the streets of New York. He had grown up hiking
through territory just as rough as Bosnia. He was also well-trained, of
course, in survival techniques and all the mysteries of communicating
with rescue operations.
The rescue commander reports that a missile was fired at one of his
helicopters and at least some guns were fired at it. The helicopter
returned fire. Serbian military spokesmen at Pale insist that they knew
the rescue was under way and deliberately did nothing to interfere, but
their reputation for untruthfulness is so well established that nothing
they say can ever be believed without corroboration.
General Mladic, for instance, announced early this week that the pilot
had been captured. That, too, was a lie. The attack on the rescue
mission is another count in the indictment against them.
The fact that the pilot is safe does not mean that any of the problems
of Bosnia are resolved. The Serbs still hold UN hostages, Nato has yet
to decide officially whether it is going into Bosnia or coming out, and
its most potent weapon, air strikes against Serb targets, has been
broken.
But, all the same, the rescue is good news and the Clinton
administration will play it for all it is worth. The President promised
today that Captain O'Grady will be brought home and that he has an
astonishing story.
Let's hope he has time to tell it before the next piece of bad news
from Bosnia breaks over us.

Bujumbura, Thursday
TUTSI soldiers from the Burundi Government army stood accused today of
massacring at least 40 Hutu civilians, including women and children, in
an assault against a militia stronghold in the capital.
Witnesses said troops used bullets and bayonets last night to
slaughter whole familes, picking easy targets like the old, the sick,
and the very young.
In Kamenge, the last bastion of Hutu gunmen in Bujumbura, journalists
counted two dozen bodies this morning. Frightened residents said more
dead lay inside houses and down back streets.
At least 15 bodies lay in Gasenyi, a suburb near Kamenge. In Kinama,
another Hutu area, residents reported two dead.
''Up until now the Hutus and Tutsis lived together peacefully in
Gasenyi. How can we live together after this?'' asked one young woman in
a courtyard where the bodies of six women and children lay nearby.
Tens of thousands of people have died in ethnic fighting in Burundi
since October 1993, when Tutsi soldiers assassinated its first
freely-elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu.
The country's ethnic make-up is similar to Rwanda, its northern
neighbour, where more than one million people were killed in a campaign
of genocide by Hutu soldiers and militiamen against the Tutsi minority
last year.
Rwanda's powerful vice-president, Major-General Paul Kagame, a Tutsi,
arrived in Bujumbura today for talks with the government.
Yesterday's killing was not one-sided. Reporters said nine people, all
but one Tutsis, were murdered overnight by Hutu gunmen in Musaga, a
Tutsi neighbourhood.
Burundi's weak coalition government, composed of mainstream Hutu and
Tutsi politicians, ordered the army sweep on Monday but told remaining
civilians to leave first.
The dead were those left behind, either to protect their property or
because they were too old or sick to move.
The bodies seen today were still fresh, indicating they were killed
yesterday when the Tutsi-dominated army moved into Kamenge after a
week-long siege and then stormed Gasenyi.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S decision to allow the deep-sea dumping of Shell's giant oil
platform Brent Spar was condemned yesterday at a conference on North Sea
pollution.
Ministers from Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and the European Commissioner
for the Environment all protested against the decision in opening
remarks to the conference in Esbjerg, Denmark.
British Environment Minister John Gummer defended the decision and hit
back at Denmark and the environmental group Greenpeace, which has tried
to block movement of the Brent Spar into the deep Atlantic.
Denmark's environment minister Svend Auken, who chaired the
conference, said: ''Offshore dumping is an unacceptable way of solving
the problem of decommissioning. Rigs like the Brent Spar should be
disposed of on land, with no option for dumping.''
Germany's deputy environment minister Ulrich Klinkurt said the
decision to dump the Brent Spar was ''highly problematic'' and all
measures to stop the action should be taken.
EU Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard, from Denmark, said offshore dumping
was unacceptable. It was a short-term measure and irresponsible.
Mr Gummer told reporters: ''There are two ways of getting oil out of
the North Sea. One is the British way, to drill for it, the other is the
Danish one, to scrape the fish up and turn it into fish oil and burn it
in a power station.''
Britain had gone through the environmental options for Brent Spar and
it was the most environmentally sound option. The Danish way (of
fishing) left death and destruction behind, interfering with the
ecological cycle of the North Sea and damaging fish stocks, he said.
Mr Gummer added: ''Greenpeace thinks it can raise money this way. They
are not prepared to fight the battle (against industrial fishing)
because you do not get money out of fish. There's nothing cuddly about
fish.
''The Brent Spar enables them to curry favour with a whole lot of
countries who have a lot to hide,'' he said.
Britain recently gave Shell permission to dump the redundant Brent
Spar, a 14,500-tonne, 460ft-high storage and tanker loading station, in
deep Atlantic waters.
Shell says the decision was the result of detailed analysis and posed
no problems for the environment. It was a one-off decision with no
bearing on the fate of many other oil installations which will soon come
to the end of their working lives in the North Sea oil fields.
Norway gave Britain some comfort with a call at the conference to
examine dumping on a case-by-case basis.
A delegate from the Oil Industry International Exploration &amp;
Production Forum defended the decision.
The conference groups include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the
European Union.
* Some North Sea fish stocks are facing the threat of extinction
because nations have failed to live up to action plans to protect the
environment, conference delegates heard.
The species under threat include cod, plaice, and sole.
''Some targets (to reduce environmentally dangerous substances) have
been reached by some nations,'' Mr Peter Hayward, spokesman for the
Fourth International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, told
a press briefing.
''But this leaves open the need for more stringent controls to be
agreed at this conference.''

Athens, Thursday
TALES of the murder, rape, and torture of young women by members of a
satanic cult gripped Greece today as witnesses began testifying in one
of the country's most gruesome trials in decades.
The three main defendants are charged with the abduction, rape, and
murder of two women and a 15-year-old girl, in satanic rituals at
deserted buildings near the Greek capital.
The presiding judge of the Athens court moved the trial to a larger
room and allowed television cameras to cover the hearing. Viewers have
been glued to their televisions since the trial opened yesterday.
Asimakis Katsoulas, 22, and Manos Dimitrokalis, 21, pleaded guilty to
kidnapping 30-year-old hotel maid Garufalia Giourga on her way home from
work, and repeatedly raping and torturing her at an abandoned winery
before crushing her skull.
They pleaded innocent to the other murders. The other six defendants,
including cult leader Katsoulas's then girlfriend Dimitra Marieti, 20,
pleaded innocent to all charges.
''I'm sorry I did not have the courage to reveal what was going on,''
Marieti told the court.
Katsoulas and Dimitrokalis, also known by their ritual names of Amon
and Enigma, confessed after their arrest in December 1993 that they led
a 20-member satanic cult conducting animal and human sacrifices in the
outskirts of Athens for three years.
The case shocked the nation and led to a series of revelations of
Satan worship in Greece.
The trial is expected to take weeks. The main defendants face life in
prison if convicted.
Baseball star
has new liver
DALLAS: US baseball legend Mickey Mantle, 63, had an emergency liver
transplant yesterday. Doctors said the surgery had gone well.
The former New York Yankee, who openly acknowledged that he was a
heavy drinker for four decades, had contracted cancer, hepatitis, and
cirrhosis.
When news of his failing health emerged this week, collectors anxious
to cash in on his possible death set phones ringing at stores across the
US in search of baseball cards, autographed balls, and other Mantle
memorabilia.--Reuter.

Ken Smith reports that despite the apparent party unity over Labour's
all-women shortleets, there is male discontent beneath the surface.
THE male backlash against all-women shortleets in the Labour Party in
Scotland has begun, with one Labour executive member accusing others of
being ''feminist dinosaurs''. Suddenly Labour's unity in Scotland in
supporting positive action to help women in politics is looking
vulnerable.
Yet the backlash is not coming, as some would expect, from ageing,
beer-swilling, trade union officials who believe a woman's role in
politics should be limited to taking the minutes of a meeting. Jim
Stevens is a 43-year-old economist at the Fraser of Allander Institute
in Glasgow. He believes that creating all-woman shortleets so that there
will be more women in Parliament is grossly unfair and deeply unpopular
with the majority of party members.
The problem is, he claims, that people who are against it find
difficulty in speaking out, as they would be deemed politically
incorrect.
''I can give you a list of people who believe in private that the
party's policy is a load of nonsense, but will be singing the praises of
women shortlists in public,'' he declares.
The reaction of most women to this will be a feeling of despair that
male egos should be so fragile. Labour's policy is that in half the
constituencies of winnable seats at the next General Election, where
there is not a sitting Labour MP, there should be a woman candidate.
In Scotland, there are six such seats, so three women candidates are
being sought. So far two constituencies, Ayr and Stirling, have
voluntarily agreed to have all-woman shortleets -- quite
enthusiastically, it has to be said. Either Aberdeen North, or probably
Aberdeen South, will be the third. So there should be no problem putting
the policy into practice in Scotland.
The reason for the enthusiasm is that all-woman shortleets is
attracting great interest from many women. The calibre of those chosen
will be very high. Some members in Stirling constituency, for example,
are believed to be considering asking barrister Helena Kennedy if she
would like to have her name put forward.
Others are pressing the claim of executive member Anne McGuire, an
extremely able woman who really should have been Labour's candidate in
the Govan by-election.
In Ayr, it could be a local candidate, such as regional councillor
Elaine Murray, but local party secretary Linda Aird insists that the
selection process will be scrupulously fair, and there was no favourite
for the seat.
It is what happens after the General Election which is vexing Jim
Stevens, who represents socialist societies on the executive of the
Scottish Labour Party.
His fear is that women will then press for the policy to apply
everywhere -- in choosing candidates for council elections, European
elections and so on.
Many woman would say: ''And what's wrong with that?''
But as Jim Stevens argues: ''There is now a level playing field for
women. The Women's Caucus in the Labour Party ignores the wider changes
that have taken place in society. You've only to look at say The
Herald's adverts for people joining law firms to see how many women are
now getting on.
''There are a lot of very able women who have come through Scotland's
universities. They don't need quotas to compete. People talk about the
glass ceiling which woman can't break through. Well, the glass ceiling
is shattering all aound us now.
''In the Labour Party you now have one member one vote so woman can
compete on equal terms. People like Rosine McCrae on the Scottish
executive who don't understand this are just feminist dinosaurs.''
He goes on: ''There are a lot of able men and a lot of able women in
the Labour Party. The members just want to be able to choose the best
person for the job.''
Is there not just the hint perhaps, that Stevens is a tad sexist? ''I
am the opposite of being sexist,'' he states. ''I see people in terms of
ability and talent. Whether they are Martians has got nothing to do with
it.''
Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, says
there is no fall-out in the party over the issue. In a sense he is
correct. Jim Stevens is a loyal party member who accepts the policy
applies -- but just this once.
He will be campaigning to ensure that it is a one-off, and that the
party chooses the best candidate in future, irrespective of gender. If
there are attempts to extend the policy, he will be seeking a ballot of
all party members to see if they support it.
Women members would actually agree with him that the best candidate
should be chosen, irrespective of gender. But with only four women MPs
out of 49 Labour MPs in Scotland they will take a great deal of
convincing that it has ever been applied.

THE Prime Minister was involved in a row with the Opposition yesterday
after rejecting suggestions that all home owners will have to pay more
when social security help for those who lose their job is cut.
He praised a proposal by Skipton Building Society to introduce
insurance cover for all its new borrowers without an increase in
premiums as an example of ''best practice'' which he hoped other
societies would follow.
His statement appeared to catch the building society on the hop as its
directors were meeting to discuss the matter.
The director of sales and marketing, Mr Alan Scotter, told Shadow
Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar, who was quickly on the phone to
him: ''We have made no public announcment as to what our plans are'',
and said he could neither confirm nor deny the accuracy of the Prime
Minister's statement.
Mr Dewar then wrote to Mr Major asking for details of ''this
unannounced scheme'' and the authority for his statement to the Commons.
He also repeated the question by Labour leader Tony Blair in the Commons
about the expected cost to the average borrower of mortgage interest
insurance cover.
Labour later said that some borrowers were bound to be excluded from
such an offer and that recent studies showed that 70% of those insured
were either not fully repaid on not paid at all on their claims.
Mr Blair asked the Prime Minister to reconsider a policy which
amounted to ''a tax on every home owner'' and would lead to more
repossessions.
Earlier, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux joined
other organisations warning of the dangers on benefit cuts which would
force people to rely on private mortgage-protection policies.
Mr Blair asked for an estimate of the increased cost to a home owner
on an average mortgage of that policy.
The Prime Minister replied that any sensible Government had to keep
reviewing the cost of the social security budget, now running at #80bn.
He told Mr Blair: ''One would hardly imagine listening to you that a
Labour study group threatened to abolish mortgage interest relief
totally.''
He said Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley had made clear that the
Government wanted to see '' a high-quality comprehensive system of
mortgage insurance to minimise the danger of home owners losing their
home through misfortune.''
The Skipton society later issued a statement stating that they were
introducing unemployment cover for its borrowers. The Opposition leapt
on a phrase by their chief executive Mr John Goodfellow that he
disagreed with the Government's action in cutting state benefits to help
borrowers who lose their jobs and spoke of the society's scheme
''limiting the damage on the already frail housing market.''
Mr Dewar pointed out that Skipton only covers 1% of the mortgage
market and questioned the position of the remaining 99% of borrowers.
Extra costs in providing cover would have to be met from somewhere, he
said, and ''the fact that Skipton price their initiative at well over
#2m tells a tale.''

Nic Outterside explains why the weakening of American pressure on
Libya over Lockerbie could strengthen moves to bring the killers to
justice.
THE US Government's decision to remove the pressure on Libya to hand
over the two men accused of plotting the Lockerbie bombing could open up
a new door to their eventual trial.
While President Clinton comes under attack at home over his decision
to end unilateral attempts to bring the alleged bombers to justice,
lawyers and campaigners in Britain say the move may bring speedier
results than five-and-half years of diplomatic threats and economic
sanctions.
According to senior White House officials, Mr Clinton has grown so
frustrated at Libya's refusal to hand over Abdel Baset Ali Al-Megrahi
and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhima that he has decided to take no more action to
enforce the long-standing demand that they be tried in either the United
States or Scotland.
''There's very little more we can do unilaterally,'' an administration
official told the Israeli weekly newspaper The Jerusalem Report this
week. The US administration had lost patience with its allies who have
not joined strengthened sanctions against Tripoli over the 1988 bombing
of Pan-Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, in which 270 people died.
FBI and Scottish police investigations of the bombing accused
Al-Megrahi and Fhima of responsibility in 1991.
However, security sources claimed their involvement was part of a
complex operation, funded by Iran and sub-contracted to Libya by Ahmed
Jibril, a former officer in the Syrian army and leader of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
Following the Gulf war and the renewed Middle East peace process, any
alleged involvement by Syria or Iran was publicly suppressed, while
Libya took sole blame from the US and British governments and the United
Nations.
When Libya ignored a UN Security Council demand that Al Megrahi and
Fhima be turned over for trial, the council banned air traffic to and
from Libya, reduced Libya's diplomatic missions, and banned the sale of
some oil-refining equipment.
These sanctions remain in place, as does the US trade embargo. But
Clinton has failed to persuade other permanent members of the Security
Council to strengthen their sanctions -- to include a world-wide embargo
on Libyan oil and a freeze on Libyan assets.
''We've had very little receptivity to our approaches,'' the US
official reported. ''We've got a lot of resistance from our allies.''
Washington's stance on Lockerbie has appeared to be weakening for
several months. The recent placing of the Libyan suspects on the FBI's
most-wanted list -- with the offer of a $4m reward -- was a final and
desperate gesture.
Despite the change of course by the Clinton administration, the FBI
last night confirmed that Al Megrahi and Fhima remained on their list of
10 most-wanted suspects and were being ''actively pursued''.
In the US the softening of foreign policy has been condemned by
relatives of the dead who claim they have been betrayed by the Clinton
administration. American activists have further urged military action to
force President Gaddafi to give up the wanted men.
But Mr Jim Swire, a spokesman for the British relatives group, UK
Families-Flight 103, has suggested that reducing the diplomatic tension
might make it easier for the respective governments to strike a deal.
Mr Alistair Duff, the lawyer acting for Al-Megrahi and Fhima also
believes that the softening of US pressure could bring about ''proper
dialogue'' and a chance for his clients to clear their names.
''My clients are anxious to have the position resolved,'' he told The
Herald. ''If there was to be a trial in a neutral country they are
confident they would  be acquitted.
''If any change by the US Government leads to softening of
relationships to allow proper dialogue between the various parties to
take place and speed up that process, that has to be welcomed.''
Two months ago, Mr Duff attended a meeting of the Arab Lawyers Union,
which publicly condemned the Lockerbie bombing and offered support to
the families of the victims. It also called on the UN to convene a
special session of its General Assembly to ''consider the Lockerbie case
in all its aspects''.
A statement said: ''The two suspected Libyan nationals have a basic
human right under international law to a fair trial before an impartial
tribunal with full transparency and publicity of the proceedings''.
Mr George Esson, the former chief constable of Dumfries and Galloway,
responsible for conducting  police inquiries into the  bombing, feels
the latest twist of fate is just ''another chapter in a series of ups
and downs''.
''Our job was to investigate and report,'' he said. ''The matter has
since been in the hands of politicians and diplomats and I have tried to
keep my personal feelings out, otherwise there is a danger of being
subject to too many disappointments.''
The battle against personal disappointment is shared by Lockerbie's
regional councillor, Mr Ernie Turpie. He said he was fed up having hopes
raised then dashed by reversals of fortune.
''Only when the British Government agrees to hold a full public
inquiry into the bombing will the people of Lockerbie and the rest of
the world know what's going on,'' he stated.
But Mr Tam Dalyell, the Linlithgow Labour MP who has campaigned
actively on the Lockerbie issue, last night said  he believed the change
of US policy was an admission by President Clinton that the Libyans were
innocent.
''The Libyans had nothing to do with Lockerbie and the US know this,''
he  asserted.
''It has all been about Pan-Am and massive insurance deals. This
change of course is now being done to save face, because the US got it
wrong.''
Mr Dalyell's position is clearly out of kilter with the British
Government's stance. While publicly insisting that the two suspects be
tried in a Scottish or US court, British officials argue that because
the available evidence shows the direct role of the Libyan government in
planning the bombing, Colonel Gaddafi would never collaborate with a
trial where that would be exposed.
Last night a Foreign Office spokesman said the Government would
maintain its own policy towards Libya, irrespective of changes in US
policy.
''We retain our demand that these two Libyans be brought to trial in
Scotland, and there are no conditions to that,'' he added.

<TEXT>
SIR Winston Churchill may have been high on a prescribed drug when he
addressed the Tory party conference in 1953, according to the biographer
of his physician.
The drug was amphetamine, known as ''speed'', which Lord Moran
prescribed after the Prime Minister's stroke.
The disclosure is made today by Professor Richard Lovell in a letter
to the British Medical Journal.
A note in the journal says: ''The biographer of Churchill's personal
physician reveals that the sleeping tablets that Churchill used
regularly from 1940 were the barbiturate, quinalbarbitone.
''After his stroke in 1953, he was prescribed amphetamine for muzzy
feelings in his head, and may have addressed the Conservative Party
conference at Margate in 1953 under its influence.''
Professor Lovell describes Lord Moran as ''a most reluctant
prescriber'' but adds: ''When Churchill was troubled by muzzy feelings
in the head after his first major stroke in 1953, Moran prescribed a
pill that Churchill called a 'Moran' and from which he obtained great
benefit.
''Moran gave his patient a test dose of this pill a few days before
Churchill's important speech at the Conservative Party conference at
Margate on October 10, 1953.
''Although there is no clear record in Moran's medical notes, his use
of a preliminary test dose and Churchill's comments on the pill's
effects indicate that a 'Moran' would have contained amphetamine.
''This was recognised as a valuable drug in the context in which he
used it; a preliminary trial dose was the rule because of the variation
between individuals in their reactions to it.''
Professor Lovell adds: ''From the 1953 stroke onwards, Moran tailored
his administration of drugs to specific situations. I doubt if those
familiar with treating the symptoms of cerebrovascular disease in those
days would do other than applaud Moran's use of amphetamine and
particularly the way in which he fine tuned the dose.
''He did not live long enough to see the small doses of aspirin become
standard treatment for the atherosclerotic disease from which his
patient suffered and whose life he may unwittingly have prolonged.''
Aspirin is now an accepted treatment for lowering blood pressure of
heart disease sufferers.
* Ordinary white sugar acts as an effective painkiller for newborn
babies, new research shows.
A research team based at Leeds General Infirmary have found that it
relieves the pain of injections given in the heel.
In a study published today in the British Medical Journal, the team
describes how babies who were given a sucrose syrup before the jab cried
less than those given plain water.
Their heart rate also returned to normal faster, according to the
research, which concludes sugar may be used as a painkiller for other
''minor procedures''.

A PLEA for the Commons to allow unpublished evidence to a committee of
MPs to be made available to the Maxwell fraud trial was withdrawn last
night after meeting strong opposition from MPs.
Tory Robert Jackson, MP for Wantage, conceded the House would not
support his motion calling for the records of the Social Security Select
Committee, which investigated the Maxwell pensions affair, to be
released to a judge to decide if they might be used in court.
He backed down after MPs on all sides voiced concern such a move would
infringe on parliamentary privilege and inhibit witnesses from giving
evidence to select committees as this might be produced later in court.
Kevin and Ian Maxwell, sons of the late publishing tycoon Robert
Maxwell, appeared before the Social Security Select Committee in 1992
but refused to answer MPs' questions.
Their trial on charges in connection with the disappearance of Mirror
Group pension fund money is currently under way at the Old Bailey. Kevin
Maxwell is a constituent of Mr Jackson.
Commons Leader Tony Newton, who is chairman of the powerful Privileges
Committee, urged Mr Jackson to withdraw his motion.

A NURSE who gagged toddlers ''for fun'' at a creche has resigned.
Mrs Margaret Ogden, 31, was last week suspended on full pay after a
mother accused her of wrapping sticky tape around the mouths of three
children at the creche at Falkirk College of Technology.
College chiefs then gave her a written warning and offered her job
back.
Last night, Mrs Ogden, of Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, said: ''I quit.
I have been in child care for 12 years. I have three children of my own
to look after, too.
''I wouldn't dream of hurting a child. The children at the creche
enjoyed the game. There was no malice or punishment intended.''
Mrs Ogden added: ''Only one mother complained and I tried to apologise
-- even though I had done nothing wrong. But she wouldn't come near me.
In hindsight, I made a mistake.''
She continued: ''I did not pick on any child. Now I'm looking for
another job.''
Last week, Ms Mary McAlpine, 27, a student, complained to the college
after her daughter claimed she had to wear sticky tape when watching
television.

THE Cabinet, having worked out its strategy for the next election
yesterday, did not have to wait long to be reminded just how good the
strategy is going to have to be. An opinion poll put the Tories 39.5%
behind Labour and any strategy is going to have to be conducted on the
lines of the Retreat from Stalingrad rather than D-Day, which looks
reserved for Tony and his boys and girls.
That the strategy involves large helpings of nationalism was made
clear by Mr Major's remarks on the single European currency which the
Euro-sceptics cheered like the Last Night of the Proms, while the odd
Euro-fans sat looking like men who thought they had bought tickets for
Tchaikovsky and got Mahler instead.
Every avenue, though, was left open, Mr Major being one of a handful
of persons who think he will still be in power in 1999, but the tone was
almost Thatcherite.
He must have been encouraged by a bit more cheering than usual from
those behind him as he disconcerted Mr Blair.
The Government is embarked on encouraging all future house purchasers
to take out mortgage insurance, not relying on the state to cough up if
they lose their job, fall ill or suffer one of the other ''ills that
flesh are heir to''. This would be quite a sensible policy if (a) the
housing market was not depressed and (b) the Government was not trying
to get back into the voters' good books.
Mr Blair raised the spectre of borrowers having to insure themselves.
What would the extra costs do to the stagnant market? Mr Major produced
his ace -- the Skipton Building Society, who are going to provide their
customers with insurance cover at no extra cost.
The Leader of the Opposition looked taken aback -- ''flummoxed'' Mr
Major thought -- and asked his last two questions on automatic pilot.
But the distance the Labour Party has come in the last hard 16 years was
illustrated by shouts from their benches of ''Who pays?''. The party of
the nineties now accepts that there is no such thing as a free lunch.
Mr Major said there would be no increase in premiums in this wonderful
scheme, and the Labour lads and lassies viewed that with as much
scepticism as a committed monetarist. He uncautiously said that all
borrowers would be covered, and they knew that could not be right.
Opposition spokesmen and journalists jostled to be first on the phone
to Skipton. There was such a scheme. It would cost #2m. Skipton, one can
be sure, will bathe in the glow of Commons publicity for some days yet.
A gap of 39.5% was a depressing number to greet the Prime Minister at
suppertime. Amateur statisticians calculated that it might see the
Tories at the next election emulate their Canadian cousins and return
just two MPs -- possibly Mr Major himself and Sir Nicholas Scott. ''What
about that?'' the Sketch asked a resigned Conservative MP. ''I suppose
it'll be all right if Major drives,'' he replied.

<TEXT>
STIRLING District Council was accused yesterday of putting young lives
at risk by allowing a children's nursery to be opened in a former
primary school which had been abandoned by education chiefs nearly 40
years ago because of safety worries.
The building housing the Acre Wood nursery below the Wallace Monument
was evacuated again last month after a leading geologist warned that the
cliffs on which the monument stands were crumbling and presented a
serious danger to life.
In 1957, in a report to an education sub-committee of the former
Stirlingshire County Council, the then director of education said
children at what was Causewayend Primary School were at risk.
His report warned: ''The school is on a very restricted site below the
Abbey Craig.
''There is an ever-present danger of falling rock. Sooner or later,
the school will have to be abandoned.''
The education committee closed the school the following year, and for
nearly 30 years the building was used by the Forth River Purification
Board.
Yesterday, however, parents and residents picketed a meeting of
Stirling District Council demanding to know why, in 1990, planning
permission for use as a nursery was granted.
Mother of three Lesley Bell, 35, whose son George, now six, attended
the nursery until two years ago, demanded: ''The council should be made
to answer.
''They should tell us why the nursery was allowed to open and put
children at risk.
''I've got twins now who are two-and-a-half. But I won't let them
inside that building. I'm very concerned over the safety aspect.''
After being shown photographs of precariously-balanced boulders above
the nursery building, councillors voted to spend more than #200,000 at
once on safety measures, including a series of rigid and flexible
fences.
Provost Pat Greenhill rejected suggestions that the council had been
negligent in allowing the nursery to open. She said nursery owner Cathy
Ritchie had been assured by the river board that there had been no
rockfalls above the old school for 28 years.
The provost added: ''I was not aware of this minute from 1957 until
someone gave it to me this week.
''Our planning officials pointed out to the applicant that there had,
sometime in the past, been danger of falling rock.
''She carried out her own research and we have no powers to refuse
someone permission on these grounds.''
Mrs Ritchie said she could not comment until she had studied the
council's decision on the remedial measures but it is understood she
does not wish to return to the site.
The nursery's 68 children and 20 staff were moved to a temporary base
in Riverside, Stirling, after a report commissioned by the council from
Professor George Matheson of the Transport Research Laboratory warned of
widespread instability in the ancient rock formation.

It examined the specialist advice available to Scottish solicitors,

MOSCOW: Nearly 400 more bodies were pulled from the ruins of the
quake-hit Russian town of Neftegorsk yesterday, sending the death toll
soaring to 2164. No survivors of the May 28 disaster on Sakhalin Island
have been found since last Saturday. Rescuers still have the remains of
four more blocks of flats to sift through.

<HEADLINE>Maxwell lied, says pensions chief</HEADLINE>

A MAXWELL pension fund adviser yesterday insisted that Mr Kevin
Maxwell lied to him over the whereabouts of shares worth millions of
pounds.
However, Mr Trevor Cook was in turn accused at the Old Bailey of lying
about the incident.
Mr Alun Jones QC, for Mr Maxwell, said Mr Cook's claim that Mr Maxwell
had told him 22 million shares in the Israeli company Teva were with
Israeli lawyers Herzog, Fox, and Neeman was: ''Either a lie on your part
or a complete misunderstanding. Kevin never said that, did he?''
Mr Cook replied: ''He did.''
Mr Maxwell, 36, of Oxfordshire, his brother Ian, 38, of Westminster,
and two former Maxwell financial advisers, Mr Larry Trachtenberg, 42, of
Hampstead, north-west London, and Mr Robert Bunn, of Hertfordshire, deny
conspiracy to defraud pension fund trustees by misusing the Teva shares
in a bid to prop up Robert Maxwell's ailing empire in the days after his
death at sea in November 1991.
Mr Kevin Maxwell alone denies a similar charge of conspiring with his
father in early 1991 to misuse #100m worth of shares in another Israeli
company -- Scitex -- to pay private Maxwell company debts.
On his fourth day in the witness box, Mr Cook, the administrator of
the pension scheme, again denied claims by Mr Jones that the Scitex
shares had been paid for by an inter-company account transfer.
Mr Cook also said it was only after Robert Maxwell died that he
discovered the Teva shares which belonged to BIM had been pledged by the
Robert Maxwell Group as security for a loan.
He was ''astonished'' when he made this find during investigations to
try to discover the exact state of pension scheme assets.
Mr Cook has told the court that, as well as Mr Maxwell telling him the
Teva shares were in Israel when they were in fact pledged to the bank,
Mr Trachtenberg also misled him about the whereabouts of the shares.
Mr Jones accused Mr Cook of lying to protect himself. ''You panicked
when you realised the group was in trouble and started trying to protect
yourself by saying Kevin Maxwell had told you a lie.''
Mr Cook said: ''That is not correct.''
The cross-examination was later taken up by Mr Michael Hill QC, for Mr
Trachtenberg.
Mr Cook agreed with Mr Hill that the publisher moved assets ''as he
thought appropriate and in my understanding, in the interests of the
parties concerned and, as I understood it at the time, to the benefit of
the pension funds''.
Asked by Mr Hill if he acquiesced in this, Mr Cook replied: ''So long
as his involvement was, in my opinion and the opinion of the trustees,
for the benefit of the pension schemes, and if I could understand the
reasons why, then I was happy to accept that he should have the
involvement that he had in the pension schemes.''
Turning to the control of pension fund assets, Mr Hill said: ''Their
purchase, their sale or their movement were taken by Robert Maxwell when
he was alive.''
Mr Cook replied: ''Certainly for most of the period while he was
alive, until towards the end of 1991, when Kevin became actively
involved in things. But, until then, Robert Maxwell had played by far
the biggest part.''
Mr Hill: ''And everybody acquiesced in that, the trustees, the boards
of directors, and you in the pensions department?''
Mr Cook: ''Yes.''
Mr Hill asked if he thought he was doing wrong by acquiescing.
''No,'' replied Mr Cook, explaining he had no cause for concern as
long as the decisions taken by Robert Maxwell were well documented.
The trial continues today.

SINGER Rod Stewart kicked off his UK concert tour in Aberdeen last
night in weather conditions that were more January than June.
However, freezing temperatures failed to dampen the 20,000-plus
crowd's enthusiasm.
Football fan Rod chose the city's Pittodrie football stadium to launch
his In The Round Tour, which will take him to Glasgow, Gateshead,
London, Manchester, and Birmingham.
His huge stage over the centre circle was crammed with nearly a dozen
of his own musicians, backed by a 22-piece orchestra.
More than 200 roadies are employed on the tour, helping to erect the
60-foot high stage and 190 speakers.
The project is Rod's most ambitious and marks the end of two years in
the wilderness for the man who has already amassed an estimated fortune
of #50m.
After nearly two hours, the singer was taken by limousine to a nearby
helicopter and flown to Aberdeen airport before heading south in his
private jet.
He is reported to be visiting his mother in a London hospital later
today as she recovers from an operation.
He will then return to Scotland for a show at Ibrox Stadium

VIOLENT Edward McAllister hanged himself in jail after carrying out
his final horrific attack on his lover.
He battered Nicola Quinn, 21, so badly she ended up on a hospital
life-support machine.
She was unconscious for weeks after he poured boiling water over her
and thrashed her mercilessly with a stick.
And yesterday, following a fatal accident inquiry Ms Quinn said: ''I
still can't forgive him for my years of hell.''
Sheriff Iain Peebles, QC, found that McAllister, 26, took his own life
at Barlinnie Prison last November while on remand.
McAllister faced charges of attempting to murder Ms Quinn in their
flat in Boyndie Street, Easterhouse, Glasgow, last August.
She was in hospital for three months and still walks with the aid of
sticks after her final beating.
The young mother was found unconscious by her parents with horrific
injuries after her father kicked in the door of her flat.
Her face was black and blue and swollen. Doctors at Monklands General
Hospital, Airdrie, found that the boiling water had entered her lungs
and she was close to death.
They carried out an emergency operation on her throat to enable her to
breath before she was put on the life support machine.
Yesterday, with her son Ross, three, at her side Ms Quinn spoke of her
''years of hell'' with McAllister.
She said: ''I have no feelings about his death, and I can never
forgive him for my years of hell. He battered me repeatedly. People will
say I should have taken Ross and left him, but I was terrified of him
and scared to leave.
''I got involved with him when I was only 17. He lived near me and I
didn't know his wife had left him because of his violence until it was
too late.''
''I don't know what made McAllister beat me up so much, I think he
just had mental problems.
''I am free now to get on with my life with my little boy.''
In his written findings following a fatal accident inquiry last month
Sheriff Peebles cleared prison staff of any blame for McAllister's
death.
He said that there were no reasonable precaution which was not taken
whereby the death might have been avoided.
The sheriff said there was no evidence of any defects in the prison's
system of assessing inmates nor in the system of supervision.
He said McAllister's lawyer had told the inquiry that a few days
before his death the deceased seemed pleased about the possibility of
him pleading guilty to reduced charges.
The findings of an inquiry into the bed sheet hanging deaths of three
other prisoners at Barlinnie are expected shortly.
Since the inquiry a fifth prisoner hanged himself last month at the
same jail and an inquiry is pending.

THE general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' union, Mr

following news that it was giving executives pay-offs totalling #2.17m,
while making 400 Scottish workers redundant.
Employees at Dawson factories at Arbroath, Kilwinning, and Hawick are
due to finish work at the end of the month, with small redundancy
payments, according to local union officials.
Mr Morris, in a letter to new company chairman Derek Finlay, condemned
the ''snouts in trough syndrome'' which, in sharp contrast to the
dreadful treatment of the workforce, allowed four executives to get
#2.17m.

Brussels, Thursday
NATO defence ministers strongly backed the deployment of a
10,000-strong rapid reaction protection force to Bosnia tonight and
warned it was the last chance to save the UN peacekeeping operation.
A full-scale withdrawal in early autumn is becoming increasingly
likely if the reinforcements do not restore what Defence Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind called ''some form of stability and basic co-operation''
by late summer.
UN credibility has been seriously damaged by the Bosnian Serbs'
strategy of taking hostages and its inability to carry out the
peacekeeping and humanitarian mandate in parts of Bosnia.
Mr Rifkind said the peacekeepers could not stay without ''consent'' --
recognition from the fighting factions, particularly the Serbs, of the
UN's legitimate humanitarian aid role.
He gave a stark warning: ''If the consent is not there the UN will not
remain. It is as simple as that.
''Consent is basic to the UN operation. They are not there to enforce
peace. They cannot fight their way through. Without a certain measure of
consent the operation could not continue.''
Mr Rifkind said the allies would be able to gauge the value of the
reinforcements by several means, including release of the remaining
hostages and, crucially, the ability to resupply the so-called safe
areas.
A senior Nato official said: ''We are looking at total freedom of
movement, no more hostage taking, and a cessation of hostilities.''
Ministers insisted the reinforcements were not a prelude to
withdrawal, although they would form the basis of a much larger
40,000-strong Nato force if a pull-out became inevitable.
''If this last chance fails, then only the safety net of withdrawal
remains, but it would be a human catastrophe and politically highly
undesirable,'' German defence minister Volker Ruehe said.
Britain has already despatched 1200 extra troops with two artillery
batteries and armoured engineer equipment. A further 5500 men from 24
Airmobile Brigade are expected to start moving later this month.
Mr Rifkind said the Bosnian Serbs had made an ''extraordinary
strategic error'' by taking hostages.
''It not only incurred the contempt of the world community for
hostage-taking but led to the massive reinforcement in the UN presence,
providing it with greater military capability,'' he said.
In Bosnia itself, the Red Cross confirmed that it had started visiting
some of the remaining 145 UN hostages.
After two weeks' negotiation, the Bosnian Serbs finally permitted the
visits to the captive peacekeepers and observers, who include six
Britons.
Officials saw an undisclosed number of UN soldiers tonight in a
location near the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale. More visits were
expected tomorrow.
However as international pressure to release the last of hostages was
maintained, there were no signals that freedom was imminent.
Today's breakthrough came after Bosnian Serbs freed 111 UN
peacekeepers yesterday. A first batch of 121 UN soldiers was released
last Friday.
Meanwhile, it emerged that Bosnian Serbs have used Saxons and other
armoured vehicles captured from the UN two weeks ago in fighting against
Bosnian government troops.
Bosnian government forces were forced to destroy one of the four
captured British Saxons, UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gary Coward
said.
Fighting continued for the second day in the hills around Sarajevo
today, where two people were killed and 17 wounded in a battle
apparently for control of the roads around the capital.
A UN official said a British Saxon armoured personnel carrier was hit
by small arms fire at Sarajevo airport and three French APCs were
targeted by 40mm cannon fire from Serb lines.
The Bosnian Serbs also fired white phosphorous rounds near a
UN-controlled bridge in the city, forcing all UN personnel to wear gas
masks. One peacekeeper required treatment.
In another development, UN officials, attempting to restore aid
lifelines to Sarajevo, won agreement from Serb leaders to reopen land
routes after six hours of talks in Pale.
A spokeswoman for the UN High Commission for Refugees said aid convoys
would start again very soon.--Reuter.

A GAMEKEEPER yesterday was cleared of attacking a mountain biker with
his Land Rover after intercepting two cyclists on a Perthshire hillside.
Mr Malcolm McPhee, 43, of Glenturret Estate, near Crieff, denied
assaulting and injuring Mr Callum Wilson, 21, by colliding with his bike
and assaulting Mr Robert Clark, 23, by attempting to collide with him.
During trial at Perth Sheriff Court, the Crown dropped the charge
relating to Mr Clark and Sheriff Robert McCallum found Mr McPhee not
guilty of assaulting Mr Wilson.
Mr Wilson, a former Heriot Watt student, said he and Mr Clark were
cycling on a hillside track when the accused blocked their path with his
Land Rover and said that mountain bikes were not allowed on the estate.
Mr Wilson said they believed they had a right to be there but rather
than cause an argument decided to turn round and leave.
He continued: ''When I glanced over my shoulder, I saw the Land Rover
bearing down on me. I got off the track on to open land as quickly as
possible but the Land Rover followed me off and struck my rear wheel.''
He said that, as a result, he hit the Land Rover bonnet before landing
beside a front wheel as his bike was run over and wrecked.
Cross-examined by defence lawyer Vincent Belmonte, Mr Wilson agreed
there was a no access sign at the gateway to the estate and that he and
a friend climbed a fence to gain access.
Mr McPhee said that, some time after he had first asked the pair to
leave, he saw they were not taking a direct route off the hill and again
warned them to leave.
He continued: ''Wilson swore at me and carried on. As I was following
him to speak to him again, his bike slewed broadside into my path and I
hit the back wheel. I had no intention of crashing into him but couldn't
avoid doing so.''
Referring to the location of the incident, Sheriff McCallum said:
''This may or may not be a road and that may be the reason why road
traffic charges were not brought by the Crown. If they had been
competent, Mr McPhee may have been in some considerable difficulty. But
I am not satisfied there was a deliberate attempt to assault here.''

MANAGERS in the National Health Service are losing the confidence of
some of their medical colleagues, employees, and the public, according
to the leader of their professional organisation.
Mr Peter Griffiths, the new president of the Institute of Health
Services Management, told more than 1000 managers at their annual
conference yesterday: ''Despite our success in improving the performance
of the health care system, the gap between the managed and managers
remains wide and may be growing.
He said managers are seen to be ''a different tribe'' and more aligned
with their political masters than representing the interests of their
employees and local communities.
''There is a perception that we regard our most cherished asset -- the
people who work for us -- as being as disposable and dispensable as
buildings and equipment.''
His comments contrasted with a report on relationships between
managers and doctors in the NHS produced by academics from Glasgow
Caledonian University and published yesterday.
The report, which was based on interviews at eight acute hospitals in
the West of Scotland, shows there is a greater understanding of the
roles and responsibilities of the two groups and a realisation that a
partnership approach is best for patients.
Mr Griffiths told the IHSM conference in Harrogate that one of the
consequences of the necessary focus on structure systems and costs over
the past few years has been ''to create the impression that we are
losing sight of the essential purposes of health care''.
He added: ''We have a more focused and well-managed health system
getting better results than ever before.
''Yet as managers we seem to be losing some self-confidence and the
confidence of some of our professional colleagues, employees, and the
public.''
He continued: ''What we need is for all of us who practise management
at whatever level, or who have some responsibility for others or
influence over events, to develop their own leadership capacity.
''That is the capacity to create a climate of confidence, trust, and
enthusiasm within which we and others can give of their best.''
Mr Griffiths said part of the problem was the large turnover in NHS
management.
Meanwhile, the Glasgow Caledonian University report Managing Doctors
showed that more than half of the clinical directors interviewed felt
that relationships between doctors and managers had improved in recent
years, with most of them believing that management had become more
receptive to the medical point of view.
There was also evidence that doctors had a clearer perception of the
managerial view and of the need for sound financial stewardship as a
means of improving and developing services.
* The conference was told that consultant surgeons each average only
five or six operations a week in Britain's NHS hospitals and some could
spend up to four half-days a week working in the private sector without
breaching their NHS contracts.
A study has also shown that 57% of operations are carried out by
junior surgeons.
Mr John Yates, head of a monitoring unit in the health services
management centre at Birmingham University, called for an inspectorate
to be set up to monitor the way consultants worked.
He said: ''The medical profession, particularly the BMA, is very
outspoken in its condemnation of a widening gap in the health status for
rich and poor and calls for accessibility to health care for all while
its members continue to collect fees for undertaking one hip replacement
in every three done in this country.''

THE Home Office is having second thoughts over its decision to send a
young brother and sister back to their troubled homeland of Sierra Leone
in West Africa.
Julliett Robbin, 18, and her 16-year-old brother Valicious, went to
the Court of Session yesterday to challenge the decision to remove them
from Scotland, but the case was halted because of the rethink by the
authorities.
Ms Robbin, 18, is living at Erskine Way in Livingston. She has a
two-year-old child and is expecting another. Her brother is staying with
foster parents in Balerno, near Edinburgh.
They arrived in Scotland in February 1991 and were allowed into the
country on an informal basis. On March 1 this year, an immigration
officer served notice on them informing them that they were to be sent
back to Sierra Leone on March 19.
The order was not enforced pending an application to the Court of
Session for a judicial review of the removal decision.
In their case at the Court of Session, the brother and sister say
their home country is in a state of instability and insurrection. They
point out that the current government resulted from a military coup and
that in January 1993, the UK cancelled #4m in aid in protest at the
execution without trial of 26 people alleged to have plotted a coup.
They allege that armed opponents of the government had taken foreign
visitors hostage and are reported to be on the outskirts of the capital,
Freetown.
Both claim that the decision to send them back to Sierra Leone is
unreasonable.
The Home Office says it does not intend to send them back until it is
considered safe to do so and that, in the light of the current
unpredictable situation in Sierra Leone, the immigration service intends
to consider afresh whether there are grounds for allowing them to stay
in the UK.
Lord Cameron was due to hear legal arguments in the case yesterday but
Mr Alan Dewar, counsel for the Home Secretary, said it would be
inappropriate for the hearing to proceed.
Mr Dewar said there was no argument that there had been a degree of
unrest in Sierra Leone for some time.
The question was whether, against that background, it was appropriate
for Julliett and Valicious to be sent back there. The information
available on March 1 had been that, although there was unrest, the
situation was not so bad as to preclude their removal from Scotland.
However, according to information made available in the last few days,
the situation was more unpredictable. Against that background, a review
of the original removal decision was being undertaken.
Mr Mungo Bovey, counsel for the brother and sister, accepted that, in
light of the reconsideration of the removal decision, there was no live
issue for the court to consider for the time being.
Lord Cameron said he would grant an order halting the court hearing.
Afterwards, the pair said they were pleased that the Home Office was
to review the case, although the deportation threat still hung over
them.

A COUNCIL'S involvement in the running of its local airport is under
threat following a refusal by the Secretary of State for Transport to
allow a major shareholding.
Dr Brian Mawhinney has told Kyle and Carrick District Council that he
was not willing to sanction the holding of shares in PIK Holdings which
operates Prestwick Airport.
His decision comes despite the fact the council has had a major
financial stake in the airport since it was bought in 1992 from BAA.
Kyle and Carrick has #100,000 worth of C shares in the company and is
represented on the board by its head of support services, Mr Graham
Peterken.
Now local concern is mounting that there may no longer be public input
into the continuing development of the airport and that its stated
position as a ''community'' airport may be threatened.
Prestwick Airport was taken over by a consortium in 1992 after a
complex series of deals which saw British Aerospace buy the runways and
aprons and Kyle and Carrick and Strathclyde Regional Council spend #3m
on the terminal buildings. The operation was leased back to PIK Holdings
and has been developing ever since.
Both councils, as well as Enterprise Ayrshire, have continued to
support developments around the airport, including a new railway
station, as well as roads and parking improvements.
There are six major shareholders in PIK Holdings -- chairman Lord
Younger of Prestwick, chief executive Matthew Hudson, former Strathclyde
chief constable Sir David McNee, local businessmen Mr Bill Miller and Mr
Tim Morrison, and the council.
Two further directors have been co-opted to the board -- Mr Peterken
and Councillor Ian Welsh, leader of Kyle and Carrick labour group, who
serves in a personal capacity after being replaced by the Conservative
administration.
Talks have been going on for some time in a bid to resolve the
situation regarding the council's shares but now Dr Mawhinney has made
it clear that he will neither sanction the shareholding nor allow a
retrospective application for permission dating back to the original
share issue.
Mr Peterken said: ''There is quite clearly a potential problem arising
but, for the moment, the council is fully represented on the board and I
am made most welcome at every meeting.
''We are continuing to seek counsel's advice and it is possible that
there may be recourse to the courts in this matter.''
A spokesman for the Department of Transport confirmed the Secretary of
State's decision and added: ''It is Government policy to discourage
local authorities from becoming involved in the running of airports and
to leave it to the private sector.
''Indeed, the Secretary of State is actively encouraging local
authorities to divest themselves of any shareholding and as such was
unwilling to allow Kyle and Carrick to continue its holding.''
The move has been described as ''outrageous'' by Mr George Foulkes, MP
for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, a long-time champion of the
airport. He said: ''I am astonished that Brian Mawhinney should take
this unjustified decision effectively to end the close involvement which
the council has had with Prestwick Airport for many years.''
''I will be writing to him at once and seeking a meeting to clarify
the situation and urge him to change his stance.''
Provost Gibson MacDonald said the council would also be seeking a
meeting with the Secretary of State to state their case. He added: ''I
am sad and disappointed that the council taxpayers of this district may
be denied a share in the success of the airport, having supported it
through the lean times.''
The district council also has a ''golden share'' in PIK Holdings which
allows a say in whether or not shares should be released or sold and who
should be the recipients. This is also under threat by Dr Mawhinney's
decision.

<HEADLINE>Cervical cancer tests falsely classify risk group, says study Doctors condemn screening 'mistake'</HEADLINE>

BRITAIN'S #100m programme to screen women for cervical cancer was
founded on a ''mistake'' that must never be repeated, a team of
researchers claims in a report.
Its introduction 30 years ago was unevaluated. Now one in 10 young
women are falsely classified at risk after ''abnormal'' smear tests.
Thousands face the worry of possible cancer and some are treated for a
condition which they may never have, according to the team from Avon
Health Authority and Southmead hospital, Bristol.
It carried out a detailed study of detection rates in around 226,000
women in the Bristol screening programme. Despite a high uptake of
tests, it found that the expected eradication of 30 to 40 city deaths a
year had not materialised. The effect of screening on death rates was
too small to detect.
Now that screening was widespread, it concludes: ''We must simply face
the fact that we can never know for certain how much contribution
screening has made.''
The study by doctors Angela Raffle, Brian Alden, and Elizabeth
Mackenzie is reported in a leading article in the Lancet. Dr Mackenzie
was formerly director of the Bristol programme.
When screening was introduced nationally in 1966, cervical cancer was
associated with abnormal cells in smears. ''But the prevalence and
incidence of the abnormal cells on smears and the effectiveness, in
terms of mortality reduction, of finding and treating women with
abnormal cells has not been established,'' the study concludes.
As pressure for increased screening and revised methods grows for both
cervical and other cancers, it warns: ''It is essential that the
limitations of screening for cancer are sufficiently appreciated within
the medical profession and among the wider public to ensure that the
mistake of introducing an unevaluated screening programme will never
happen again.''
It finds ''encouraging'' the decline in national death rates -- down
to around 1660 from 2088 15 years ago. Much of that decline was
attributable to older women who had not been screened, it says.
It points out that, in each Bristol screening round, about 15,000
healthy women were being incorrectly told they were ''at risk'' and more
than 5500 were being further examined, with many also being treated.
Each round covers a five-year period.
''The real lesson from 30 years' cervical screening is that, no matter
how obvious the predicted benefit may seem for any screening test,
introduction should never take place without prior evaluation of both
positive and negative effects in controlled trials.''
In a statement concerning the Bristol study, the NHS Cervical
Screening Programme said cervical cancer was the most common cause of
death in women under 35.
It added: ''The women who are most at risk -- older women and those in
inner cities -- are now starting to reap the benefits of the improved
programme and the death rate among younger women is also starting to
fall.
''The evidence available clearly points to the benefits of the
screening programme and the national co-ordinating team is committed to
improving the existing quality systems and introducing even more
effective ones.''
Deaths in Scotland from cervical cancer have fallen from 244 in 1973
to 170 20 years later, a drop from 9 to 6 in the rate per 100,000
population.
The rate among 35 to 44 year-olds has actually risen, from 5:100,000
to 9:100,000.
* A 32-year-old nurse who had to travel more than 150 miles for breast
reconstruction surgery yesterday urged women to speak out and ask for
the treatment.
Ms Claire Brown, from Glenurquhart, near Inverness, had to ask for a
referral to the specialist unit at the Western General Hospital in
Edinburgh for a joint operation to remove and rebuild her breast after
cancer was diagnosed.
The mother-of-two, who is due to be released from hospital today, is
backing the Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign, which has long argued for
equality of access for breast cancer sufferers to specialist units.
The results of rebuilding surgery are deemed to be much better if
carried out at the time of breast removal.
Raigmore NHS Trust, where Ms Brown was treated initially, has denied
any opposition to patients being referred to specialist breast units for
reconstruction surgery.

<HEADLINE>Legal clause clouds right-to-buy issue. Doubts raised over council house sales</HEADLINE>

AN elderly Scots couple have won an unexpected victory in their
three-year battle to buy the council house in which they have lived for
the past 40 years.
Their win could prove to be a double-edged sword, however, continuing
to throw the Government's flagship right-to-buy policy in Scotland into
disarray.
The end of John and Rebecca Patience's fight to own their home in
Avoch on the Black Isle could now mean hundreds of council house sales
all over Scotland are put ''on hold''. It also means many people who
believed they had bought their council houses in Scotland since 1980 may
not, after all, be the legal owners of their homes.
Mr and Mrs Patience live in Ormonde Terrace, Avoch, on land which once
belonged to the Rosehaugh Estate.
The estate's sale of the land to the predecessors of the present
council carried a clause giving it first refusal in the case of any
subsequent sale -- something that is in clear conflict with the
Government's policy that any sitting council tenant had the right to buy
his or her home.
The Patiences' hopes of home-ownership seemed thwarted when the
present owners of the estate demanded a four-figure fee from Ross and
Cromarty District Council to waive this condition and so allow the sale
to proceed.
The council refused to pay up and twice challenged the estate owners
in the Court of Session.
In 1991, Rosehaugh Estate, complete with its ancient feudal
privileges, was bought by Scarborough-based company Broadland
Properties. The council had planned a final appeal to the House of Lords
to have the law clarified.
Now Broadland's lawyers have written to the council offering a free
''waiver'', thus allowing this particular sale to go ahead -- but making
it clear that this was not to be seen as a precedent.
Yesterday, Mr David Neill, the district council's legal director, was
suspicious of the move.
He said: ''We are very pleased for Mr and Mrs Patience and hope that
this will be the end of their troubles.
''However, our case on their behalf was about to go to the House of
Lords and I am wary about Broadland's motives for granting a free waiver
on this property after fighting for years to avoid just this.
''The upshot of this move may be that we cannot now go to the Lords to
get a final ruling on this archaic anomaly in the law that is causing a
problem for councils all over Scotland.''
The district council now faces a #10,000 legal bill for the action so
far and the sale of two of their houses remains frozen.
Lawyers at the Scottish Office were first informed of the problem in
1985 but assured councils that the new right-to-buy legislation
cancelled out ancient feudal laws.
Now the Government has been forced to look again at the issue.
Scottish Housing Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton has told
Labour's Scottish housing spokesman, Mr John McAllion MP, that the
matters raised by the recent Court of Session judgment are extremely
complex.
He says: ''It may be some time before I am able to make an
announcement on this matter.
''In the meantime, councils all over Scotland are now aware that
estate owners now know about the law on this matter as it currently
stands.
''In certain cases, this is making them wary of concluding sales with
council-house tenants.''
Hundreds of others who believed that they had become houseowners when
they bought their houses under right-to-buy legislation could also find
that the validity of their title deeds is open to challenge. This has
already come to light in a recent example in the Lothians.
Yesterday, lawyer John MacLeod, of Edinburgh-based Snell and Co, said
on behalf of Broadland Properties: ''We have no comment to make, other
than that there is now no dispute between us and Ross and Cromarty
Council.''

FAMILY doctors were on a collision course with the Government over
out-of-hours cover last night, in a dispute which could throw the NHS
into chaos.
An offer from the Department of Health aimed at resolving
dissatisfaction over night calls was rejected overwhelmingly in a
ballot, with 83% voting against.
Doctors' leaders are to make a final approach to Ministers in an
attempt to solve the dispute, the British Medical Association's general
medical services committee said later. However, if the negotiations fail
or are too slow, a ballot would be held to allow the BMA to authorise
industrial action.
GPs currently receive #47.85 for home calls made between 10pm and 8am.
Under the Government package, they would receive #20 for every
face-to-face consultation, plus a lump sum of #2000.
Although this might be a welcome bonus for GPs who were not called out
at night, the reality is that out-of-hours calls have more than doubled
in the past five years -- often for frivolous reasons -- and many
doctors want them dealt with some other way.
Ministers have promised an extra #45m for the health authorities to
invest in out-of-hours services. It could be spent on supporting rotas,
including GP co-operative services, or setting up drop-in centres that
people could attend through the night.
However, the medical services committee claims #100m would be more
like the sum required.
''This is for out-of-hours care for 55 million people,'' said Dr Brian
Keighley, deputy chairman of the Scottish GP's committee. ''That needs
premises, secretarial support, and the kind of facilities patients will
expect if they are going to use them.
''The vote shows the depth of disenchantment that GPs feel towards the
current arrangements for general practice and their anger at the way
they have been treated over all sorts of issues over the past five
years,'' said Dr Keighley, who warned that there would be a swift
progression to industrial action if Health Minister Gerald Malone did
not return to the negotiating table.
''People have stopped coming into the profession and many of those in
it are retiring early -- as early as 55 or 50. They are voting with
their feet.''
The committee was also seeking a commitment to resource adequately a
patient information campaign aimed at helping them to use the service
responsibly.
''If this does not happen, the service to people who really need it
will be seriously compromised,'' said Dr Keighley.
Ballot returns reached 77%, with GPs voting by 20,345 to 4274 to
reject the offer. Announcing the result, committee chairman Dr Ian Bogle
said: ''This result clearly shows that there is little support for the
Government's offer, which fails to meet GPs' concerns.
''The way in which out-of-hours care is delivered in this country must
be changed. A system that met the needs of the 1940s and 1950s is no
longer suitable.
''Family doctors are under stress and today's vote is a symptom of a
much deeper malaise affecting general practice.''
Mr Malone, who had indicated that the offer was final, gave little
indication of moving towards the doctors' views. He said GPs could opt
out of after-hours cover as long as other doctors were willing to step
in to keep the service going.
He said the Government had made an ''important concession'' to help
settle the dispute over doctors' night visits, one which ''needs to be
highlighted''.
Mr Malone said on BBC Radio 4's World at One: ''I have agreed that the
regulations will be changed so that a doctor who doesn't wish to
undertake after-hours cover will be able to assign that -- with the
consent of a family health services authority to make sure the cover is
still there -- to another doctor who might be able to pick that up.''
Attention is now likely to focus on what sanctions the GPs can impose
on the Government without affecting patient care.

A SCOTTISH nurse has been awarded the highest civilian honour created
by the Queen in recognition of her leadership of the International Red
Cross delegation involved in the Rwandan crisis.
More than 250,000 Rwandan refugees crossed the border into Tanzania
during a 24-hour period in May last year to flee the bitter civil war.
Ms Sheila Wilson, who was born and brought up in Paisley, was
responsible for establishing the Ngara tented village within six weeks
of the exodus from Rwanda and a water purification plant which pumped
out about 12,000 litres of clean water an hour.
She also helped to oversee the arrival of millions of tonnes of food
and medical relief supplies sent to the camp.
Ms Wilson was presented with the Meritorious Service Cross in
recognition of her ''leadership, dedication and courage'' by the Queen's
representative, the Governor General of Canada, at a ceremony in Ottawa
last week.
She is the first Red Cross member to receive the award since its
inception in 1991. It is given to ''recognise a deed or activity
performed in an outstanding professional manner or according to an
uncommonly high standard that brings considerable benefit or great
honour to the country.''
Ms Wilson, whose work with the charity over the past 18 years has
taken her to the heart of many of the world's worst disasters in remote
regions of Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Sudan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan,
told of her surprise yesterday at being nominated for the award during a
rare visit to Glasgow.
''I was amazed because I didn't expect a personal award, but gratified
personally, and on behalf of the Red Cross that it was given to me. It
is a great honour,'' she said.
Ms Wilson trained as a nurse at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital
before joining the Red Cross.
Now based in Geneva, Ms Wilson still visits her parents in
Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, whenever time allows.

<HEADLINE>Souness tackles QC over assertion that former wife had to 'grovel' for cash to feed their children 'Dirty rat' takes on the Bengal tiger</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977977618</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FORMER Rangers manager Graeme Souness said yesterday a Bengal tiger
would not be able to control his former wife.
He was undergoing his second day of cross-examination in the High
Court in London at the hands of George Carman QC, for the People
newspaper, which is fighting his claim for libel damages over a report
branding him a ''dirty rat''.
Mr Carman suggested that threats to evict Danielle, 39, from her home,
send her to prison for failing to complete a questionnaire about her
financial affairs, and get custody of their children were part of his
need to dominate and control her.
''A Bengal tiger couldn't do that to my ex-wife'', said Souness,
watched by Danielle and his second wife Karen, 35.
He told Mr Justice Morland and a jury that, since he met Karen,
Danielle had done nothing for him except ''cause me headaches and tell
lies''.
In the People story in May 1993, his former wife alleged he ordered
her, their sons Fraser and Jordan, and adopted daughter Chantelle, to
leave Norton Farm, Worplesdon, Surrey, by Christmas Eve 1992 and refused
to pay the boys' school fees.
She claimed she was living on hand-outs from her parents, and that
even before the ''eviction'' she had to grovel for cash to feed and
clothe the children.
Souness, 42, of Mere, Knutsford, Cheshire, denied thatDanielle left
him in 1988 because he treated her ''indifferently''.
Mr Carman said: ''You were the big boy at Rangers and had no time for
her and the children, save what you could spare.
''You put your job, friends, and career first and she was just an
appendage, there when you needed her to cook your dinner.
''That's what made her leave. You made this woman lose her
self-respect, didn't you?''
Souness guffawed and his ex-wife looked down, shading her face, as he
replied: ''I don't think so. I was a good husband, a good father, to the
best of my abilities.
''Some of the responsibility must have been mine. But I only wanted
the very best for my wife at the time and my children.''
Mr Carman said: ''You treated your wife in a harsh way. One example of
this was when she tried to open a shop while you were the manager at
Rangers and you said to her: 'Run a business? Who's going to be there to
cook my dinner?'.''
Souness replied: ''The first I knew about this venture was in a
matrimonial statement I received only last year.''
He said his former wife wanted him to leave the Rangers' job ''which I
was enjoying and dedicated to''. He added: ''She wanted me to go back to
Spain -- and do what?''
He denied he was determined to make Danielle conform to what he wanted
over Norton Farm, a mansion which he bought in a trust to benefit the
children following the separation.
He said she had the choice of signing a tenancy agreement which would
have given her the right to stay there until Jordan, now 10, was 18.
He denied Mr Carman's suggestions that he used threats to
''terrorise'' her and ''bring her to heel''.
They were ''empty'' threats to focus her mind on signing the
agreement. She was never evicted but left of her own free will.
Mr Carman said Souness had been asked to pay a #3000 gas bill for
Norton Farm because Danielle was so hard up. Mr Carman added that if the
bill was not paid, then the gas central heating at the property would
have to be disconnected. Only then did Souness reluctantly pay the bill,
said Mr Carman.
Mr Carman said: ''You were also asked to pay school fees for the boys
when they went to Majorca and you refused, didn't you?''
Souness replied: ''Yes, I was only liable to pay for the boys when
they were in the UK. I wanted to choose their schooling -- not some
Mickey Mouse school in Majorca.''
Mr Carman added that Souness reluctantly paid #50 per week maintenance
for his sons.
Mr Carman said: ''Was this the best thing you could do to offer your
children, just #50 per week help when you were worth about #3m.''
Souness replied: ''I just wanted my children back in the UK.''
Earlier, Mr Carman had questioned Souness, who also managed Liverpool,
as to why he had never gone ahead with his applications to gain custody
of his two boys.
Souness replied: ''The kind of media interest that would have
generated would have been harmful for my children.''
Mr Carman accused Souness of telling his former wife to ''bugger off
back to Majorca''.
Souness answered: ''No I didn't. I had never said that.''
Souness, a former Scotland midfield player, said he was brought up in
a prefab and worked for everything he had.
Mr Carman said: ''Everyone in this courtroom has worked for what
they've got.''
Looking at his ex-wife, Souness said: ''Well, I can point to one who's
not, sir.''
Asked if he had not realised he was making his former wife desperate,
Mr Souness said: ''She hasn't been desperate from the day she was born.
Take a trip to Majorca and see how that family lives.''
The hearing continues.

CHILDREN are the hidden victims of domestic violence, too afraid to
speak out and often overlooked by the agencies called in to help an
abused mother, it was claimed yesterday.
At a conference in Glasgow held by Scottish Women's Aid and Scottish
Child, workers from the statutory and voluntary sectors heard a call for
greater public awareness of the anguish experienced by children
confronted by domestic violence.
Ms Lesley Irving, of Scottish Womens's Aid, said that in addition to
actual assaults around 70% of children were living in families where a
man regularly verbally or physically abused his wife or girlfriend.
Ms Irving said that the Children's Bill (Scotland), currently before
the House of Lords, did not mention child abuse in spite of aiming to
enshrine children's rights in law.
''We are calling for a set of guidelines to be followed by those
working with victims of domestic abuse on how to deal with the problems
faced by children.''
She said there was also a need to alert the wider public so that
children felt they could discuss their experiences.
The anti-domestic violence campaign on television had, she added, gone
some way in breaking the silence but it only depicted adults.
The problems associated with domestic violence are all too familiar to
Ms Dawn Brennan, 26, of Clydebank. When she was 15 she, her brother, and
her mother fled to a refuge after enduring years of emotional and
violent abuse.
Speaking at the conference, she described how the refuge offered the
opportunity to talk to other children who had witnessed domestic abuse.
She said there needed to be a recognition by statutory bodies that
mothers and children should be kept together

Mr Tom Hamilton, proprietor of the Kirriemuirhill-based Elysian

He said those who had expressed concern at a protest meeting this week

He wanted to give pet owners peace of mind and provide a service

A SEX offender who abused young boys over a 15-year period was jailed
for 10 years at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
David Black, 47, of Girdleness Road, Aberdeen, suggested to one of his
victims that he should go to London and get paid for being a rent boy.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice Clerk, told Black: ''It is one of the
worst cases of this nature with which I have had to deal. No-one can
tell what the long-term effect may be upon these four boys.''
Black admitted committing nine indecency assaults against the boys
between January 1980 and March this year.
The offences took place in houses in Aberdeen, Glasgow, and villages
in the North-east of Scotland, when the boys were aged between 10 and
17.
Mrs Valerie Stacey, advocate-depute, told the court Black was
unemployed and had four children. He knew the parents of some of the
victims and, in some cases, had invited the boys to stay in his home
with the excuse that they were playing with his own children.
When the mother of one of the boys went into hospital, he volunteered
to stay with him and regularly abused him.
The offences came to light when one of the victims told friends what
had been happening and they advised him to contact the police.
When he was questioned by detectives, Black admitted abusing the boys.
Mr Alan Muir, defence counsel, said Black had been subjected to sexual
abuse while he was in an approved school.
By pleading guilty, he had spared his victims the ordeal of giving
evidence and he had expressed great concern about the effect his abuse
would have on them.
Black hoped he would receive treatment for his condition while he was
in prison.

DRAMBUIE International Film Festival looks set to play host to the
European premieres of at least three major Hollywood movies this year.
Already confirmed is Scots director Gillies McKinnon's Simple Twist of
Fate, with its star, comedian Steve Martin, lined up to make a guest
appearance.
It also seems entirely possible that the Jekyll and Hyde-inspired Mary
Reilly, which was partly filmed in Edinburgh with Julia Roberts in the
title role, and Mel Gibson's long-awaited tartan epic, Braveheart, will
top and tail this year's festival.
There is some speculation that Braveheart could be shown in Stirling,
an appropriate setting considering the subject matter, and still be a
part of the Edinburgh-based festival.
Another film which looks set to be included in the event is Ken
Loach's Spanish Civil War epic, Land of Freedom. Loach is currently
working on a new film, partly financed by Glasgow Film Fund and partly
filmed in the city.
Stanley Donen, who directed Singin' In The Rain, has already confirmed
he will attend.

ACTRESS Siobhan Redmond travelled to Cromarty yesterday to launch the
Dolphin Space Programme, designed not to send the cetaceans into orbit
but rather to ensure they can live happily in their home waters around
the Moray Firth.
The programme encourages people to respect dolphins' need for space.
It urges those who want to observe dolphins, whales and porpoises around
the firth to either watch from the shore or take boat trips with
''accredited'' operators who have agreed to observe a code of practice.
Mr Kenny Taylor, northern officer of the Scottish Wildlife Trust,
which along with Scottish Natural Heritage and the European LIFE group
launched the programme, said yesterday: ''The Moray Firth supports the
only known resident population of bottlenose dolphins left in the North
Sea, and some of the most northerly in the world.
''There are only around 130 of them, so it's vital we don't let our
affection for these creatures create problems which might threaten their
existence in the Moray Firth.''
Mr Taylor said the dolphins had come to symbolise people's awareness
of the need for a clean and healthy environment. But they could be seen
from some of the best dolphin watching shores in Europe, or from trips
organised by operators who had agreed to follow the code of practice.
Ms Redmond, as well as appearing in Between the Lines, also narrated
BBC's recent Operation Survival programme on how the dolphins were
attacking harbour porpoises in the firth.
She said that programme had suprised some. ''In our culture dolphins
have become synonymous with sweetness of dispostion, serenity and a sort
of supernatural wisdom.
''In fact, although they may possess all these qualities, they are
wild animals. Animals who give enormous pleasure to us humans and who
surely deserve from us respect and room to be themselves.''

CHARLIE Nicholas spoke yesterday of how Davie Cooper's family
convinced him and Scottish Television to complete the soccer skills
series which the late footballer was filming when he collapsed and died
earlier this year.
The Celtic player and the director of the series, Mr Ian Hamilton,
said the decision had been extremely difficult. However, the more they
thought about it, the more they were convinced the programme should go
ahead.
Even at the hospital, with Davie Cooper lying close to death, his
family said the life of the former Rangers legend had been a celebration
of football. They wanted the series to continue.
''We thought that, since Davie's family and the kids who took part in
the filming were happy for it to go ahead, then we should continue with
it. There was a lot of fun and humour in it and we didn't want to lose
that but at the same time we wanted to remember him and his
contribution.
''He had so much fun out there and we wanted it to be a celebration of
his skills,'' said Nicholas.
The first programme in Shoot, a 10-week series which takes a group of
budding football stars through their paces, will be broadcast on
Saturday, June 17. It opens with a dedication to Cooper's talents from
Nicholas and Scotland coach Tommy Craig.
The player collapsed during filming at Broadwood Stadium, Cumbernauld.
He was taken to hospital but died later from a brain haemorrhage without
regaining consciousness.
Due to the circumstances, his contribution to the series was not used.
However, Scottish Television have kept it and they may, as a tribute to
the player, broadcast it after a year if it is thought fitting.
Mr Hamilton said that, on the day he died, Cooper had been taking free
kicks from the corner flag -- and had scored four in a row. The director
then bet him double-or-quits that he couldn't make it five.
The fifth hit the crossbar and Cooper, in jocular fashion, was upset
at missing out on #20.

<HEADLINE>Hearing told of dresses for boy Father tells custody court how wife who wanted a girl made her son wear make-up</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
A BOY at the centre of a custody battle was made to wear dresses and
make-up because, it was claimed, his mother always wanted a girl.
This left the nine-year-old lacking in confidence, a court heard
yesterday.
''My wife dressed him in girl's clothing and let him carry handbags,''
claimed the boy's 45-year-old father.
''She put his hair up in different types of girl's styles, put make-up
on his eyes.''
The man was giving evidence at Aberdeen Sheriff Court during a final
custody hearing over the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
The custody case was highlighted recently when sheriff officers
dragged the boy kicking and screaming from his father's home.
Thousands of viewers around Scotland saw the incident on the BBC's
Reporting Scotland programme.
Yesterday, under questioning from his lawyer, Mr Richard Ward, the
boy's father told the court his wife had always wanted a girl after
previously having had a son, now 15.
''From the birth of the second child, my wife had great changes of
mood,'' he said.
''Her actions became irritable, unreasonable, uncompromising, even for
very trivial matters.
''As well as dressing him up, she encouraged him to become friendly
with girls.
''My concern was that she was actively encouraging him to do that. It
was something I was not happy with at all.''
The man also said the boy became much more confident after his mother
split with him and left the house.
''He became confident, whereas before he had been put in this position
that he did not want to go out,'' claimed the man.
Later, the father told the court how his son was dragged from his
house, kicking and screaming, by sheriff officers.
The father said he had tried everything, including using limited
physical force, to persuade the boy to go on an access visit to his
mother.
''I said that, if he did not go, I would end up in prison. I pushed
the point about the prison but it did not make one iota of a difference.
He was adamant that he did not want to go.''
He said a warrant was granted to sheriff officers in early May after
his wife had been granted interim access but they failed to persuade the
boy to leave the house.
A few days later, a court granted his wife interim custody and the
father was ordered to take the boy to the sheriff officers at an
appointed time but refused to do so, claiming it was pointless.
The father claimed the older of the two sheriff officers waved a piece
of paper in front of his face and said: ''You know what is in here,
don't you.''
''He went over to my son and said 'right, son'. He spoke to him as if
he was an adult, everything he said was totally over his head.
''He had no idea how to treat a child in any shape or form. He was
saying phrases that he would not comprehend.''
Asked about the suggestion that he had programmed the boy to scream in
the presence of the TV cameras, the father replied: ''Utter nonsense.''
He told the court his wife had dressed their son like a girl from the
time he was a toddler until he was seven.
After his wife left the family home, added the father, access visits
became a traumatic experience for the boy.
The father claimed his wife would arrive with a car full of adults who
would gesticulate at him and draw their hands across their throats in a
threatening manner.
The TV sequence, which was not shown in court, was screened on May 19
this year with the faces of the sheriff officers, the boy, and his
father obscured.
The hearing, before Sheriff Alexander Jessop, continues.

RELATIVES of victims of the Chinook helicopter crash at the Mull of
Kintyre have called for a meeting with Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind
because of claims that the Government is planning to restrict
compensation.
The families of the 25 Northern Ireland counter-terrorism experts who
died when the helicopter crashed on June 2 last year have also alleged
that the Ministry of Defence has delayed releasing a report on the crash
to minimise bad publicity which a bid to limit payments could attract.
The Ministry is understood to have had the accident report since
March, and is expected to release it next Thursday.
The report is believed to focus on why the helicopter was flying so
low, and is thought likely to blame pilot error for the crash.
Relatives gathered at two ceremonies in Northern Ireland and at the
crash site last Friday, the first anniversary of the tragedy.
A statement issued yesterday by solicitors acting for the families
said they were ''shocked and horrified to learn that the MoD may be
contemplating using some legal device to limit the amount of damages
that would otherwise be payable to the families in compensation for the
grievous loss they have sustained.
''The families feel particularly hurt by the callous way in which the
publication of the detailed report has been delayed until after the
first anniversary of the crash, solely for the purpose of trying to
minimise adverse publicity.''
One of the solicitors acting for the families, Mr Fred Tyler, of
Balfour and Manson, Nightingale and Bell, of Edinburgh, said yesterday
that, although a military flight did not have a limitation of liability,
it was feared the Ministry would attempt in this case to apply the same
rules as apply to a civilian flight by classing the Chinook as an air
transport undertaking. This would limit liability to #110,000 a family.
Last night, a Ministry spokesman declined to say whether it was
seeking to class the flight as an air transport undertaking.

TRADING standards officers said last night that they believe they have
smashed the counterfeit ring responsible for the fake Tetley tea-bags.
It was also revealed that 23 shop owners in the Glasgow area could be
reported to the procurator-fiscal today for knowingly handling the
counterfeit goods.
While some fake tea-bags turned up yesterday in Edinburgh and Dundee,
Mr Andy Moynihan, Strathclyde region's trading standards controller,
said they had the counterfeiters on the run after discovering they had
dumped 100,000 empty Tetley tea boxes in a wood in Glasgow.
Trading standards officers found the fake boxes in the wood off
Muirhead Road at the back of Glasgow Zoo after being alerted by an
anonymous tip-off.
They believe the boxes had been dumped late on Wednesday night or
early yesterday morning.
The officers also believe they are zeroing in on a ''factory'' in the
East End of Glasgow where the dangerous fakes were being manufactured.
Mr Moynihan said: ''They've thrown away all the packaging and the
machinery and the factory has been closed. With the serial numbers
having been published, there was no chance of selling them.''
Lothian Regional Council's trading standards department confirmed
yesterday that some of the fake tea-bags had turned up in the Muirhouse
area of Edinburgh, and in West Lothian.
Mr Mike Drewry, head of the Lothian department, said a team of about
40 safety and enforcement staff had been ordered to investigate a number
of wholesale outlets in the city.
Mr Drewry said: ''Counterfeiting of products is a major problem today.
When it includes food, it is even more serious, bearing in mind that, a
few years ago in Spain, counterfeit vegetable oil caused blindness among
people who bought it.''
Trading standards officers in Dundee yesterday seized nearly 40 boxes
of the counterfeit tea-bags in swoops on corner shops in the Douglas and
Fintry housing schemes. The bags were sent to Tayside's public analyst
for scientific checks.
Mr Jim Matthew, acting director of trading standards in Tayside, said
the boxes came from the Glasgow area. He added: ''Boxes have already
been seized by trading standards officers and efforts are being made to
locate others which may be on sale in smaller retailers or at markets.''
Hundreds of boxes of the fake tea-bags were seized across Strathclyde
on Wednesday.
Mr Moynihan said criminals from Glasgow had moved into commercial
crime because the market in drugs had become saturated.
However, this, together with a similar incident involving fake coffee
in the past few weeks, was the first time they had put counterfeit food
on to the market.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council said samples of the fake
tea-bags were still being analysed by the council's chemist to check for
health hazards.
The fake tea-bags are expected to contain low-grade tea that could
possibly be mixed with floor sweepings such as sawdust or even rat
droppings.
The tests are expected to be completed today but will not be released
pending the possibility of a report to the procurator-fiscal.
The fake bags are Tetley 80 packs, serial number 4017E, expiry July
95. The packaging differs from the genuine Tetley packs because it has
no blue pull strip on the cellophane wrapping. The packs' recommended
price is #1.55 but fake packets have been recovered selling at #1.39.
Tetley has set up an information line -- 0800 141214.

<HEADLINE>New attempt to condemn cheese</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977977632</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A COUNCIL has returned to court in its determined bid to have batches
of gourmet cheese condemned as unfit for human consumption.
Cheesemaker Humphrey Errington won a ruling against Clydesdale
District Council at the Court of Session in April which set back the
local authority's attempt to take action over the Lanark Blue.
The council has now launched a challenge to Lord Weir's decision
before three appeal judges.
Lord Weir ruled in Mr Errington's favour that he had been denied
natural justice when a decision was taken to condemn batches of the
cheese as potentially hazardous to health because of contamination with
the food bug listeria.
Mr Errington, who farms near Dunsyre, in Lanarkshire, maintains the
cheese is safe to be eaten.
However, a Justice of the Peace, Mrs Elizabeth Wilson, ruled that in
terms of the 1990 Food Hygience Act the cheese was potentially hazardous
and unfit for human consumption.
Mr Errington then won a court order preventing the destruction of the
blue-veined, semi-hard cheese and appealed against the decision through
a judicial review.
Lord Weir said the JP's refusal to allow Mr Errington's lawyers to
cross-examine witnesses at the hearing before her amounted to a denial
of natural justice.
Clydesdale has returned to the Court of Session claiming Lord Weir
erred when he made his decision.
It is arguing that the JP was acting in an administrative capacity and
not as a judge when she decided on the future of the cheese.
The JP properly used her discretion in these circumstances when
refusing to allow cross-examination, it claims.
The cheese at the centre of the row -- which Clydesdale first took
action over in February -- remains deep frozen at Mr Errington's farm.
He has warned that if the case goes against him it could undermine his
business and jeopardise jobs.
The appeal before the Lord President, Lord Hope, sitting with Lord
Allanbridge and Lord Clyde, continues.

<HEADLINE>GEC hits VSEL with #835m salvo</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>977977633</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE defence and electronics company, GEC, took the first step
yesterday towards total domination of Britain's arms industry with an
#835m bid for VSEL, builders of the Royal Navy's Trident missile
submarines.
The aim is to torpedo a rival bid by British Aerospace and clear the
way for an eventual takeover of BAe itself.
If that happened, GEC would be the only conglomerate in the UK able to
offer a complete package of military shipbuilding, aircraft
construction, radar, avionics, and weaponry for UK and foreign markets.
Between them, the two groups manufacture everything from rifle bullet
gunpowder to strategic nuclear missile boats.
GEC already owns Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde, the last
British-controlled major yard on the river and the designer of the RN's
Type 23 frigates. Acquisition of VSEL would combine the two principal
suppliers of surface warships and submarines.
The scramble for VSEL comes two weeks after the President of the Board
of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, cleared the decks for a takeover,
overruling objections from the Monopoly and Mergers Commission.
However, it would be unlikely that the MMC could ignore a future
hostile takeover of BAe which would put GEC in almost total command of
the arms market and eliminate domestic competition.
GEC has already tried to quell fears that a merger of the two
shipyards would mean mass redundancy on Clydeside. Yarrow has been
promised at least seven years' work on surface warships if the bid is
successful.
Nevertheless, the STUC yesterday called on the MMC to force GEC to
give legally binding guarantees on future employment, investment plans,
and workers' rights.
Its assistant general secretary, Mr Richard Leonard, said: ''The
workers and taxpayers are caught up in the middle of a boardroom battle
with little or no say in the outcome, few rights, and no mechanism for
extracting information.''
Defence analysts saw yesterday's move as GEC going for a knockout blow
rather than boardroom manoeuvres. The company already owns 14% of the
Barrow-in-Furness yard and its assets.
GEC is about four times the size of BAe in stock market terms and
consistently profitable. It has diversified into electrical and
power-generation equipment.
VSEL, which is working on the last two of Britain's four
Vanguard-class Trident submarines, also manufactures the AS90
self-propelled howitzer and the Mark 8 naval gun.

FORMER Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer yesterday claimed he had made
repeated attempts to hold meetings with two businessmen who have lodged
a #1.2m action against his company, Cosmopolitan Investments.
Mr Mercer, who flew to Edinburgh from his South of France home, said
the content of the action against him should have been resolved in
business meetings behind closed doors -- and not in a courtroom.
Mr Chris Robinson and Mr Leslie Deans, who bought a controlling
interest in Hearts from Cosmopolitan last summer, announced earlier this
week they were suing the company and said they had taken steps to freeze
its remaining 25% club shareholding.
They said the claim arose from certain warranties given by
Cosmopolitan at the time of the sale which, they said, had been
breached.
Speaking at an Edinburgh hotel, Mr Mercer, 48, said: ''Normal practice
is for people to sit down in gentlemanly fashion and discuss between
respective lawyers and accountants the make up of any claim.''
Despite his return to the capital, Mr Mercer -- with his legal adviser
by his side -- said he had yet to receive a summons from the new Hearts
bosses.
He said he had made repeated attempts to hold a meeting with Mr
Robinson, a catering company boss, and Mr Deans, an Edinburgh lawyer.
''I have tried on numerous occasions, in writing, through telephone
calls, to get the two of them to sit around the table and talk to me.
''For whatever reason, that has been denied me, even up to last week,
when a meeting was cancelled with two hours' notice.''
He said the claim had been made just days before the #125,000 first
instalment in the businessmen's #810,000 deal was due. He stressed the
court action did not allow the present men at the helm to escape their
financial commitments to Cosmopolitan.
The former chairman also denied he was involved in any takeover bid at
the club by retired property developer Jim Glass.
Mr Mercer said he did not want to talk about ''Machiavellian plots'',
and had returned to Edinburgh only to talk to friends and advisers and
to make himself available to the Scottish media. He said he had no plans
to return to Scottish football.
0   Mr Robinson was said to be out of the country until Monday, while
Mr Deans could not be reached for reaction to Mr Mercer's claims.

RUGBY is a safer game than many of its critics suppose, according to
the authors of a new study which chronicled the injuries of 1200 players
among 26 senior clubs in the Borders during the 1993/4 season.
In 37,000 hours of rugby, it found no cases of spinal cord damage,
which often leaves the victim paralysed.
However, 361 injuries were reported, ranging from broken limbs to
strains.
Tackling was the major source, more so in the player tackling than the
player being tackled, and knee joints were the most vulnerable part of
the body.
The average player can expect to be injured every 2.7 seasons and be
out of the game for six weeks afterwards. No position on the field is
particularly vulnerable to injury although the centres sustain most
tackling.
Gregor Townsend, the Scottish centre, deprived of a trip to the World
Cup in South Africa because of torn ligaments sustained in a tackle,
welcomed the study's findings.''There is this masculine image about
injuries and you are just an eggshell if you get repeated injuries. I
think this whole image needs to be looked at further.''
The study, published in today's Lancet, was carried out with the
support of the Scottish Rugby Union by Professor Michael Garraway, of
Edinburgh University's department of public health sciences, and surgeon
Donald Macleod, a medical adviser to the SRU.
Dr Ian Todd, incoming SRU president, said it would re-examine how
coaches could give better training on tackling and the full results of
the study would be passed on to the International Rugby Football Board.
Professor Garraway said it was wrong to label rugby as dangerous. The
risk of spinal injury was higher from diving into a swimming pool.

<TEXT>
WRITER and teacher Jonathan Smith -- whose latest book Summer in
February is due out in paperback -- is at the centre of a plot worthy of
any novel.
For his identity has been stolen by Scottish-born convicted rapist
Norman Dorrington.
For at least seven years, Dorrington has been living in London calling
himself Jonathan Smith and claiming huge amounts of social security
benefit under that name.
''It's really a bit spooky'', said the 53-year-author and
public-school master, who teaches English at Tonbridge in Kent and
writes novels and radio plays for the BBC during the holidays.
''It is rather psychologically disturbing to have someone take on your
identity. He even claims to have lived in Australia.
''I have lived and worked in Scotland and Australia -- I taught in
Melbourne for a year. It is as though he has been following me around.''
The first Mr Smith knew of his sinister shadow was when the DSS
mounted an investigation in 1989, having discovered that payments
apparently going to Mr Smith were being cashed into accounts in Chiswick
and east London.
At Isleworth Crown Court in west London yesterday, Dorrington -- who
shares his date of birth with Mr Smith -- was found guilty by a jury of
six specimen charges of false accounting and two of deception.
While claiming sickness and housing benefit in his own right,
apparently suffering from depression, he ''assumed the identity of a
real person who knew nothing about it, even giving his National
Insurance number, and mounted a fraudulent claim on the DSS'', said Mr
Anthony Prosser, prosecuting.
''As a result he has taken a total of #19,000 in unemployment benefits
and over #23,000 in housing benefit.''
Dorrington, who denied the charges, told police he used a false name
because he had served time in Scotland.
In 1972 he was jailed for 14 years by Glasgow Sheriff Court for three
rapes. It was reduced to 10 years on appeal and he was released on
parole in 1979.
But he claimed he had been approached by some men in an East End pub
and forced to make the claims, under threats of violence and blackmail.
He was remanded in custody for reports and will appear for sentence in
July.

A TRIPLE killer was on the run in Glasgow last night after eluding his
prison officer escort while on leave in the city.
Yet, despite the fact that Andrew Gentle has killed three people and
was serving a recommended minimum sentence of 20 years, a prison service
spokesman said Gentle's recent behaviour did not suggest he would be a
danger to the public.
The circumstances surrounding his escape were still being
investigated, he added.
Gentle, 58, was jailed for life in 1982 for the murder of Glasgow
criminal Ian Waddell, who had confessed to a journalist that he killed
Rachel Ross, the murder for which Paddy Meehan was wrongly convicted.
Gentle had stabbed a woman to death when he was with Waddell, and
later strangled his accomplice. He had previously been found guilty of
culpable homicide for a third killing 13 years earlier.
Other convictions included attempted murder and assault.

SCOTRAIL, the Scottish Tourist Board, and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise yesterday announced they were to work together to develop
Highland rail routes. They will all try to attract passengers,
particularly tourists, and explore greater integration with public
transport services such as ferries and buses.
HIE has pledged financial support for ScotRail to produce promotional
literature for travellers from Inverness to Wick/Thurso and on the line
to Kyle of Lochalsh.
ScotRail director John Ellis said: ''This is an extra boost to our
successful promotion of the Highland lines and our commitment to the Far
North line. Both the Wick/Thurso and Kyle of Lochalsh lines are safe now
thanks to their inclusion in the Passenger Service Requirement for the
next seven years. No line has ever been given a guarantee like that
before, so we are delighted now that we can get on and market the lines
as aggressively as we can.''
HIE's chief executive, Mr Iain Robertson, said a #20,000 marketing
package from HIE had already secured steam services on the Fort William
route this summer. ''The debate over the future of the Highland rail
services, and not just the Fort William sleeper, will continue. However,
we are taking every opportunity to assist projects which get more people
on trains.''

BRITISH Rail board members yesterday made no firm decision on whether
to appeal to the House of Lords in one last bid to close the Fort
William sleeper service.
Nor would BR give any clear guidance on how many other ''ghost''
services were operating on its network similar to those in Strathclyde.
BR did not indicate to what extent it might be affected by Wednesday's
Court of Session decision to uphold Lord Kirkwood's earlier reprieve for
the sleeper service pending a full public consultation process.
The BR board, which has three months in which to lodge an appeal, did
hear an initial report on Wednesday's judgment but apparently decided
that further detailed legal advice was required before a final decision
was taken.
The rail unions are poised to raise the cases of some 10 other
''ghost'' services which they maintain are being used to mask similar
cutbacks throughout Britain.
Aslef's general secretary, Mr Lew Adams, said the sleeper judgment
''spooked the ghost''. There could now be no justification for ''lying
to the public over cuts in order to avoid the consultative process''.
A spokesman for the Rail, Maritime, and Transport union thought the
Fort William decision would have major implications south of the Border
and was a further example of how BR's cases for service closures tended
to fall apart under public scrutiny.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney, meanwhile, tried to portray
himself as ''the passenger's friend''.
He would not ''shirk away'' from difficult decisions which would bring
about more use of the railways.
At a transport conference in London, he went on: ''I believe
privatisation is going to be a success and will achieve the objective of
providing a passenger service more focused on what the passenger
wants.''
Privatisation was ''not some ideological dogma but actually a
pragmatic determination to tackle an issue that needs to be tackled --
an improved railway system''.
Dr Mawhinney said 17% of all journeys were by rail in 1953 but this
was now down to 5% and falling. In the same year, 24% of all goods were
moved by rail but was now at 5% and falling.
He went on: ''If nothing is done, then you can foresee that these
figures could be down to 1% in future years.''
Dr Mawhinney said investment levels in newly privatised industries
always increased dramatically despite scare stories to the contrary.
Discussing the view that ''more and more money'' should be poured into
the railways, Dr Mawhinney said that,since the railways were
nationalised in 1948, a total of #54bn had been put into the system and
it had continued in relative decline.
He added: ''I am not saying that the resources issue is not an
important one. Of course it is and that's why we have made a commitment
to continue the inflow of taxpayer's money into the rail system.
''But if you want to tackle this kind of decline, you have to move
from the public to the private sector.''
He said the Government had been criticised for separating the track
authority from the providers of services in the new-look railway.
However, countries such as Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Sweden were
all now looking at the UK's methods for their own railways, he added.
Dr Mawhinney said: ''Most people out there are interested in the end
product rather than who happens to own it. Passengers want a good,
reliable, comfortable service, delivered courteously.''
* Strathclyde Regional Council is set to take ScotRail to court today
to try to win an interdict preventing it from concluding a track access
agreement with Railtrack. Strathclyde believes the track access
agreement could inhibit its right to determine subsidised train
services.
The case will be heard in the Court of Session.

BRITAIN'S smallest independent radio station is itching to begin
broadcasting so that it can give a regular midge warning in the summer.
A midge count will be broadcast next Tuesday from Lochbroom FM's
studio, a shed in the Wester Ross fishing village of Ullapool.
Klondikers, foreign fishing factory ships, regularly berth in Loch
Broom, and the radio station also intends to have Bulgarian and Russian
programmes produced by the ships' crews.
Programme controller Andy Mitchell said: ''We have quite a
cosmopolitan audience although we are on Scotland's north-west coast and
we are hoping to cater for them all.
''Everyone knows the nuisance that midges cause, so we thought we
would warn tourists of the days when the midges are likely to be at
their worst by giving them a rating of up to 10.''
Also on the programme schedule is a version of The Archers called The
Goldrush Inn -- a title inspired by the klondikers who pour thousands of
pounds into the local economy every year.
Lochbroom FM has Britain's smallest potential audience. There are 5000
people in the Ullapool area but the mountainous terrain and a 25-watt
output may mean it can't reach the entire population.
Moray Firth Radio, which serves mostly the east coast of the
Highlands, has provided some of the technical equipment for the launch.

EXCLUSIVE
SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang is to be questioned about a Scottish
Office purchasing official who has left to join a company with whom he
had negotiated a lucrative contract on behalf of the National Health
Service.
Mr Stuart Axon, who was involved in buying hearing aids through the
NHS Common Services Agency, left on Friday to become Scottish sales
manager with A and M Hearing, of Crawley, West Sussex, a subsidiary of
the German Siemens company.
Contracts for the supply of hearing aids are due for renewal soon and
the Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said there was
concern in the industry that A and M might have the benefit of intimate
knowledge Mr Axon may have gathered about other companies during his
Scottish Office career.
He said: ''I am going to write to Ian Lang asking how it is that
someone in such a position can move to one company in the industry, and
how much confidential information he will have about other companies.
''I will also be asking what assurances he can give that this
information will not be used to the advantage of A and M, and that the
interests of the other companies will not be damaged.''
There are about four or five companies involved in supplying hearing
aids to the NHS, and Mr Robertson pointed out: ''This is no ordinary
industry -- there is a monopoly buyer and a number of suppliers. They (A
and M) have hired a man who knows everything about every other company
in the industry.
''If someone from the buyers walks out and into one of the companies
there is bound to be concern. He was directly involved in the
negotiations. If a man like this worked in industry for a big company
his contract would not allow him to go and work for the competition. Why
should this man be any different?''
The Scottish Office said that Mr Axon had been number four in the
hierarchy of his department, and that his role in awarding contracts
appeared to have been exaggerated.
''There is no problem here and no rules preventing him from doing
this. He will have signed the Official Secrets Act,'' said a spokesman.
Yesterday, Mr Axon was working at A and M's Crawley headquarters.
Asked about his new job, he said: ''Is this a wind up?'' and declined to
comment further.
A spokesman for the company said it had a contract with the NHS but
could not give details about the size or value. Inquiries about Mr
Axon's post were directed to the UK sales manager, Mr Clive Moore, who
was ''in a meeting''.

THE value of tourism in Scotland has slumped by 15% over the past five
years, according to a report published today.
Mackay Consultants says there are signs that the worst of the decline
may be over. However, while it welcomes new marketing initiatives by the
Scottish Tourist Board, it warns that much more needs to be done to
improve facilities and standards of service.
The firm's latest annual examination of the industry indicates that
tourism output fell by 4% in 1994 to #1832m. That figure represents a
15% drop since a peak of #2145m in 1989. Output has fallen every year
since then, except in 1993.
The main reason for this downward trend has been a fall in domestic
tourism -- the numbers of UK residents holidaying in Scotland. This
sector dwindled by more than 10% last year and has shrunk by a total of
about 40% since 1989.
A new marketing strategy for England, one of many changes introduced
in the industry last year as a result of a Scottish Office review of
tourism, has been welcomed by the consultants.
The report predicts a growth in overall tourism output of just over 1%
this year, pointing out that the fall in the value of sterling against
most other currencies should boost the numbers of overseas visitors.
This forecast breaks down into increases of 4.8% in overseas tourism
and 2.4% in the day-trip sector but a fall of 2.3% in domestic tourism.
The region which suffered the worst decline in overall tourism output
last year was the Highlands and Islands, with a drop of more than 6%. It
was particularly badly hit by the fall in the number of English
visitors.
It also appears at the bottom of the regional table in terms of
forecasts for this year: it is expected to suffer a drop of 0.6%. The
regions with the best forecasts are Lothian, which is expected to
benefit greatly from the Tall Ships' Race next month, and Strathclyde,
with increases of 2.3% and 1.8% respectively.
The consultants state: ''This geographical pattern is consistent with
our belief that tourism in Scotland is becoming increasingly
concentrated in the Central Belt, including the cities of Edinburgh and
Glasgow, and that many visitors are becoming more reluctant to venture
to more distant parts such as the Highlands and Islands.
''Cost is undoubtedly a major factor in such decisions. Whether this
is a short-term trend, which can be revised, remains to be seen.''
The report also argues that many parts of Scotland do not give good
value for money, particularly in comparison with countries like Greece,
Spain, and the US.
Mr Tony Mackay, managing director of Mackay Consultants, said
yesterday that, in principle, he believed the STB's marketing strategy
had improved recently.
However, he added: ''I still have strong reservations about the
quality of services and facilities and value for money. The STB should
be doing much more there. If the product is not good, there is little
point in spending large sums of money on marketing it.''
An STB spokesman said: ''This report sheds more heat than light on the
performance of Scottish tourism over recent years. STB has said for more
than a year that the English market has been declining and that if
Scottish tourism is to grow, then we need to arrest and then reverse
that decline.
''Those people who earn their living in tourism businesses throughout
Scotland are well aware that 1994 was not a bumper year for the
industry. STB has said so repeatedly but, more importantly, has
introduced new campaigns in the English market, the Scottish market and
overseas to remedy the situation.''
There was evidence to suggest that 1995 would be a much better year,
he added, including the number of inquiries to tourist information
centres and the number of requests for STB holiday guides.

LABOUR was challenged yesterday by the main teachers' union, the
Educational Institute of Scotland, to reverse long-term underfunding of
schools.
A properly-funded service was one of several commitments which the
union would seek from a Labour government, the EIS incoming president
Malcolm Mciver said.
He told the union's annual conference in Perth that the EIS would also
look to Labour to restore democratic accountability in further education
colleges and give education the resources it needed.
The outgoing president, Mrs Norma Watson, reminded all political
parties that there was ''no justification for any reduction in education
budgets''.
She warned: ''We only need to look at what is happening in the health
service to remain unconvinced by the honeyed reassurances that the
service is in safe hands.''
Delegates overwhelmingly supported an emergency motion calling for a
campaign to challenge Government education funding cuts.
Hard-left delegates unsuccessfully argued that the real emergency was
in the FE sector, where lecturers faced the threat of compulsory
redundancy because of reduced funding from the Scottish Office.
Delegates were told that it was crucial to secure the support of
parents.
Mr Danny McDonald, who teaches at Rockwell Secondary, Dundee, said he
didn't think the union could get parents to listen when the talk was
about the intricacies of the curriculum but he said: ''They will listen
and understand when their class sizes rise inexorably to 33 pupils, when
nursery places disappear and when there are no replacement teachers to
cover for those who are off.''
Mr Mciver said the Government was cutting expenditure as part of a
strategy to offer tax cuts as a bribe before the next General Election.
''We are now working in a service which is deliberately and
consciously being starved of funds,'' he said.
Mr John Patton, a primary head from Central region, warned that
underfunding would lead to school closures, attacks on teachers' work
conditions, and increased workload.
In Lothian region, delegates heard, heads had been given
responsibility to implement budget cuts and had to make savings ranging
from #7000 to #46,000.
The cuts amounted to #1.25m in the primary and #1.7m in the secondary
sector.

THE climber who died in an avalanche in the French Alps on Wednesday
was yesterday named as Mr James Turner, 27, who was born in Millport, on
the island of Cumbrae.
Mr Turner was climbing Mont Blanc with a friend, Mr Simon Frost, when
they were swept away. Mr Frost, who was slighly hurt, is receiving
hospital treatment in Chamonix.
The pair were discovered after a guide climbing in the area saw the
accident and radioed for help. Rescue services arrived quickly but one
man was already dead.
A French police spokesman said: ''It's a miracle that one of them
survived.''
Mr Bryan Bubb, the British Vice Consul in Lyons, was hoping to speak
to Mr Frost.
The dead man's mother, Mrs Janet Turner, speaking at the family home
in Oban, Argyll, said James had followed in his scientist father's
footsteps to take a physics degree at Glasgow University but dropped out
of the course to pursue his climbing interests.
In the four years since then he had taken casual work in Europe and
Scotland which gave him the time and opportunity for climbing.
He had gone to the Alps to get experience of Alpine climbing
conditions to further his ambition of becoming a mountain guide in
Scotland.
''All his time was spent in the mountains. He had a great love of the
mountains but in particular his heart was in the Scottish mountains,''
she said.

Pilot's mother never lost faith
US fighter pilot Scott O'Grady was ''happy to be alive'' aboard an
American warship in the Adriatic last night after being plucked to
safety by a Marine rescue force deep inside Bosnian Serb territory.
Helicopters braved missile and gunfire attacks to pull out the
29-year-old Top Gun, who had survived for six days on ''rainwater and
bugs'' after his F-16C jet was shot down by a Bosnian Serb anti-aircraft
missile.
Military officials said O'Grady, who was resting in the hospital
aboard the amphibious assault ship Kearsarge, was suffering from
exposure and exhaustion.
The doctor, Lieutenant Commander Paul Rochereto, said: ''He's really
happy to be alive. He's real happy to be aboard a US ship and I think
he's doing real well.
''I think that once the adrenaline sort of eases off and he realises
how close he came to not being here at all, he may be a little bit more
sombre than the way he is right now.''
Lt Cdr Rochereto revealed O'Grady had begun to eat insects after his
meagre rations ran out -- he believed they were ants and crickets.
The dramatic dawn operation was launched after an American F-16 pilot
flying over Bosnian Serb territory early yesterday picked up a radio
message from O'Grady.
A massive package of air power was rapidly put together in less than
three hours after Nato commanders were roused from their beds.
Electronic jamming jets swamped air defence radars, and F-16, F/A-18,
F-15 fighters and strike aircraft provided top cover as two giant CH-53
Super Stallion helicopters roared in.
The helicopters carrying 40 marines and led by Brigadier General Marty
Berndt landed just 50 metres from where O'Grady had been hiding in
woods.
As the general looked out of his helicopter, he saw O'Grady running
towards the aircraft covered in sweat and waving his pistol.
Admiral Leighton, Nato's southern commander, said the general hauled
O'Grady aboard.
''Marty is a pretty strapping guy. He reached out and grabbed the
young man and pulled him in,'' said Admiral Smith.
As the rescue team took off from the landing site in north-west
Bosnia, it came under attack from a shoulder-launched missile and
gunfire. A Marine gunner on one of the helicopters opened up in
response.
''He was able to silence those guns,'' said Admiral Smith. ''Whether
or not he did harm to anyone we don't know.''
One of the helicopters was hit in the rotor blades by small arms fire,
a member of the rescue team said later.
Marine Sergeant Scott Pheister said: ''We took fire from a lot of
places. We have a couple of blades that have bullet holes through
them.''
Admiral Smith had warm praise for the rescue mission. ''It took a lot
of courage. It was a very, very risky operation and I think it was done
very well.''
Asked how the pilot managed to survive for six days without capture,
Admiral Smith replied: ''Guts and training -- that's what got him
through this.''
He stressed: ''He was very determined and gutsy to have got out of it.
He is obviously one very talented man.''
President Bill Clinton hailed the rescue in a message from the White
House as a moment of pride and joy.
''All Americans rejoice with me at the successful rescue of Captain
Scott O'Grady and join his parents in their relief after days of
uncertainty and anguish,'' he said in a statement.
''Captain O'Grady's bravery and skill are an inspiration. So are the
bravery and skill of those who took part in the operation to rescue him.
They are all American heroes.''
Captain O'Grady's mother said she was ''grateful'' her son was alive
and thanked military officials for their support during her six-day
ordeal.
''We are so grateful and so thankful,'' a beaming Mary Lou Scardapane
told reporters outside her Seattle home.
She said the past week had been difficult but said she never lost
faith that her son would be found alive.
Captain O'Grady's stepfather, Dr Joseph Scardapane, said the pilot was
''an improbable Rambo''.
''But he's mentally strong,'' he said. ''He's definitely the kind of
person who could survive in this situation. We did not consider the
alternative.''
His rescue also provided a shot in the arm for the military and
politicians in Nato and the United Nations following humiliation at the
hands of the Bosnian Serbs after they took UN peacekeepers hostage
against Nato air strikes.
American flags decked the Aviano air base in north-east Italy where
Captain O'Grady operates with the US 555 Fighter Squadron and yellow
''welcome home'' ribbons festooned his nearby house.
''There were a lot of people who had written this guy off,'' said
Captain Jim Mitchell, Nato's southern command spokesman.
''He stayed cool, he stayed hidden, and he moved from where he was to
where he had to be to get picked up,'' Captain Mitchell said.

US assault troops were yesterday reported to be ready if asked to
rescue small groups of United Nations peacekeepers from Bosnia in daring
night missions similar to the one that recovered downed pilot Scott
O'Grady.
Defence Secretary William Perry, speaking before news of the pilot's
rescue from Bosnia, said 2000 Marines on warships in the Adriatic and
2000 airborne soldiers based at Vicenza, Italy, could get in an out of
Bosnia quickly using attack and transport helicopters.
''We could do that virtually in a 24-hour turnaround,'' Perry told
reporters.''We go in there in the middle of the night, pick up the
troops, take them out, dump them somewhere. Then we go home. It's a
24-hour operation that can be done by the forces we have there
already.''
Virtually as Perry was speaking to reporters aboard his plane taking
him to Brussels for a meeting of Nato Defence Ministers, US Marines
plucked Captain O'Grady from Bosnian Serb territory in their dawn rescue
operation.

Nurses accept local bargaining in return for no strings on pay offers
THE fragile coalition of health unions was in jeopardy last night
after Royal College of Nursing leaders broke ranks by appearing to
accept the principle of local pay deals.
A settlement with the RCN over nurses' pay looked like edging closer
in the wake of a letter from Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley which
in effect removes many of the ''strings'' attached to offers made by
trusts which the RCN had insisted were unacceptable.
In return, the Government said the RCN had offered a concession on the
principle of local pay.
Last night, the Scottish Office said the provisions in the letter
would also be applied in Scotland. This is a complete reversal of its
statement 24 hours earlier that it had no plans to chase up the three
remaining Scottish trusts which had not made offers.
Ms June Andrews, Scottish secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
said: ''It is a major breakthrough towards resolution of the dispute. We
should see a real increase in the number of offers with no strings.''
However, an official of the health branch of another union attacked
the RCN for ''going it alone''. Mr Mick Fisher, head of health for the
GMB, said the college's leaders should not be making deals with the
Government.
''If there have been secret meetings between Christine Hancock (the
RCN general secretary) and Virginia Bottomley I am absolutely appalled.
The members of the RCN have been superb during this dispute and I am
sure they will not accept a separate deal.''
Ironically there is also less enthusiasm for the ''breakthrough''
among some trust managements who feel that the Government has simply
foisted more problems on to them.
''They are telling us to drop the strings, but they aren't putting up
the money for it,'' said one trust source. ''We had to attach the
strings to our 3% offer to help pay for it. If we take the strings off
the offer will have to go down to 2.5% or 2%.''
A Scottish district nurse who is a member of the RCN claimed that her
general secretary, Ms Hancock, had been ''conned'' by Health Minister
Gerry Malone. The nurse, who did not want to be named, said: ''I don't
think it is any coincidence that this offer has been made within a day
or two of us receiving our ballot papers for industrial action. It is an
attempt to spoil the ballot.
''What we are really insisting on is national negotiations for all NHS
staff. It is quite wrong to say we are in favour of local negotiations.
''We all had letters from our trust saying we could get 1%, and maybe
2.5% if we gave up public holidays and cut down absenteeism, which is
horrific because of the pressure everyone is under. They can't even
afford to pay us 3% with strings -- how will they pay it without the
strings?''
In her letter to Ms Hancock, Mrs Bottomley referred to a meeting
between them and said she understood the RCN was now prepared to reach
local pay settlements.
''For my part, I have undertaken to take steps to encourage those
trusts in England which have yet to make their pay offers known locally
to do so as soon as possible. I am asking my colleagues in Scotland,
Wales, and Northern Ireland to act similarly,'' she said.
Mrs Bottomley said she would also repeat the Government's message to
trusts that increased funding for the NHS permitted fair settlements,
implying that these should not be achieved by cuts elsewhere.
''The NHS executive will remind trusts that the issue of local
variation of conditions of service has been remitted to the Nursing and
Midwifery Staffs Negotiating Council for further negotiation and will
not form part of the pay agreement for this year,'' she added.
It is this critical passage which eases the deadlock. It means that
cuts in holidays, enhanced payments, and other allowances cannot be used
as strings attached to trust deals this year.
Ms Andrews said the campaign still had a long way to go and would not
end until every nurse had 3% in his or her pay packet. Although the RCN
did not want local pay bargaining, the ultimate effect would be to
secure a national agreement.
She said the ballot of members on changing the RCN's policy on
industrial action would go ahead regardless, since this involved much
wider principles than the pay dispute.
The extent of the potential difficulties ahead can be gauged from the
confusion over which trust has made an offer.
According to the Scottish Office, only three trusts have yet to make
offers: Glasgow Dental Hospital and School, Kirkcaldy Acute, and Angus.
The RCN says it still has to hear from these and a further three:
Ayrshire and Arran Community Healthcare, Stobhill, and Dundee
Healthcare.
Mr Fisher said it was obvious that the Government had been trying to
divide the health unions as the only way of averting a damaging dispute
this summer. He conceded that if one union reached a deal it was bound
to weaken the case of the other unions.

THE complexion of Britain is set to become yellowish as many more
acres are put under daffodils over the next five years.
Edinburgh-based fine chemicals manufacturer Meconic will be looking
for 20,000 tonnes of bulbs each year as it manufactures galanthamine,
the vital ingredient in a new drug developed to contain Alzheimer's
disease.
The drug is in the final stages of assessment and commercial
production should begin by the year 2000.
World production of daffodil bulbs is only 11,000 tonnes, of which
9000 tonnes are already grown in Britain. So Meconic is working out how
to build up stocks to meet demand as it requires 10,000 tonnes to
produce just one kilogramme of galanthamine.
It is already signing up contract growers in Lincolnshire which has an
ideal climate and is also investigating the possibility of having
daffodils grown in Scotland. This will result in a prettier picture than
oilseed rape and turn thoughts back to Wordsworth. However, it could
also damage the cut flower trade through over supply of daffodils.
Meconic is the parent company of Macfarlan Smith, which was first
established by surgeon apothecary John Macfarlan in 1780. The company
became famous as a supplier of opium in the nineteenth century and today
is the only legal supplier of opiates -- including heroin and codeine --
in Britain.

TONY Blair is enjoying the highest level of public approval of any
Labour leader in history, and his party has opened its lead over the
Tories to 39.5%, a poll shows today. A Gallup poll for the Daily
Telegraph put Labour support at 59.5% (55.5% last month), Tories at 20%
(23%), Liberal Democrats at 14.5% (16.5%) and other parties at 6% (5%).
The Tony Blair honeymoon with the public shows little sign of dimming
with 68% of voters believing he was proving a good Labour leader. The
previous record -- the 67% achieved by the late Harold Wilson in the
early days of Sir Alec Douglas-Home's administration -- had stood for
more than three decades. Meanwhile, a two-hour crisis session of the
Cabinet yesterday resulted in Prime Minister John Major preparing to
launch a new Tory fightback.

<HEADLINE>Ministers in 'immunity' row over power sell-off</HEADLINE>

LABOUR last night demanded an independent inquiry into the
privatisation of the two national power generating companies in England
and Wales after the Stock Exchange cast doubt on the role of Ministers
in the sale.
A Stock Exchange inquiry into the #4000m flotation of National Power
and PowerGen appeared to have hit the buffers because the Government can
claim immunity from prosecution.
Labour seized on the disclosure -- in a letter to the Treasury from
Stock Exchange chief executive Michael Lawrence -- as evidence that the
Government was guilty of insider dealing.
The Stock Exchange is investigating allegations that Ministers failed
to disclose in advance of the sell-off that electricty regulator Stephen
Littlechild was planning to cap prices.
The announcement led to a sharp drop in share prices amid Labour
accusations that the Government deliberately withheld market sensitive
information.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown called for Ministers to spell out in
detail what they knew and when.
''There has now got to be an independent inquiry into the role of the
Treasury in one of the biggest privatisation sales,'' he said.
''The Stock Exchange have been unable to clear the Treasury of the
accusations made and question marks will remain so long as there is no
inquiry.''
Mr Lawrence said the Stock Exchange launched an inquiry into whether
the Treasury or other public bodies were in possession of
price-sensitive information which should have been made before the sale.
In the letter, to Treasury permanent secretary Sir Terence Burns, he
said the Stock Exchange would normally refer its findings to regulatory
or prosecution authorities which would then consider whether to
investigate further.
He added: ''We have discussed the position of this inquiry with other
regulatory and prosecutory bodies.
''Given that we are advised that the Crown has immunity from the
relevant provisions of the Financial Services Act, our normal referral
procedures are not appropriate in this case.
''In the circumstances the Exchange believes that the best way forward
is for the Treasury itself to determine how to examine further the
handling of this privatisation, including the dissemination of
information between various parts of the public sector and between the
public sector and the market.''
Shadow Trade Secretary Jack Cunningham called for a Commons statement
from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to spell out exactly when the Government
discovered the regulator's plans for a price clampdown.
''Ministers and officials in the Treasury are in effect technically
guilty of insider trading -- thousands of investors lost thousands of
pounds as a result of Kenneth Clarke's conduct of this matter,'' he
said.
The Government must now apologise to investors who may now believe
they were entitled to compensation, he said.
Stock Exchange sources said the investigation found itself up against
''extraordinarily unusual circumstances'' because of the rules governing
Crown immunity.
''We have done what we are there to do to the best of our ability but
we feel a further investigation is required. The normal routes are not
appropriate,'' one source said.
''The Treasury is the final controller of the Financial Services Act
within the legal structure so in a sense they are the only ones who can
exempt themselves from the immunity provided by it.''
It was stressed the Stock Exchange was not pre-judging the outcome of
any further inquiry.
The Treasury last night said a senior official unconnected with the
flotation would be investigating the circumstances surrounding the sale.
A spokesman said the results of the inquiry and any lessons to be
learned would be reported to Mr Lawrence and the letter published.
The Treasury insisted it was not immune from prosecution for alleged
insider dealing and said the matter remained in the hands of the Serious
Fraud Office, which had been making its own inquiries into the sale.
