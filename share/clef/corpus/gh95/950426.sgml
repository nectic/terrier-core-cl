THE sheer scale of the Education Business Partnership conference
becomes apparent from the programme of workshops and issues sessions
which will throw light on how enterprise education is being approached
in this country and abroad.
One session tomorrow afternoon will hear from Simon Andrews of the
Chamber of Mines, Metals and Extractive Industries of New South Wales
about partnership activities undertaken in that part of Australia, to
the benefit not only of the industry but also of the educational
establishments involved.
Donna B Evans of the University of North Florida will also be speaking
tomorrow at a workshop on the best practice in preparing pupils for the
adult world of work. She will explain Florida's Blueprint 2000, a state
initiative designed to improve student achievement and to prepare
students for responsible citizenship and employment in what is a
culturally diverse and sophisticated workplace.
Also from the US, there is to be a chance to work out how one would
have come up with the economic revitalisation strategy necessary to
revive the fortunes of the Monongahela River Valley of Western
Pennsylvania in 1987.
After that there will be comparisons with what actually happened: a
public education fund was created and enabled 25 district schools to
participate in an unprecedented partnership with the local and business
community to devise an effective strategy. The resultant Mon Valley
Education Consortium will be represented at the workshop by Leonard
Koshinski.
Closer to home is the workshop from Scotvec whose representatives,
Chief Executive Tom McCool and Schools Development Officer Maria McGill,
will invite delegates to make the short walk from the Hilton to their
Glasgow city-centre headquarters.
There they will explain Scotvec's National Certificate Modules,
Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs), General Scottish Vocational
Qualifications (GSVQs), Higher National Certificates (HNCs), Higher
National Diplomas (HNDs), and Professional Development Awards.
Scotvec, or the Scottish Vocational Education Council, is of course
the national body in Scotland with responsibility for awarding,
developing, and accrediting vocational qualifications.
Two initiatives from Castlemilk will feature in tomorrow's workshops,
the first presented by Ruth Fletcher of CEDA, the Castlemilk Economic
Development Agency.
This will discuss the importance of entrepreneurship in economically
disadvantaged areas, highlight enterprise-education activities currently
taking place in this particular housing scheme, and allow young people
to take a full part in the presentations.
Castlemilk's more cosmopolitan side will emerge from the second
workshop, presented by Evelyn Lennie of the Transition to Adult Life
Project. This one will feature young people from two Castlemilk schools,
along with students from their partner school in Spain, talking about
how they have benefited from taking part in European work experience,
international mini-companies, and joint investigations.
Evelyn Lennie will also be involved the following day in a Steal And
Share session at which she and Anne Brooks of The Castlemilk Partnership
will discuss this particular approach to regeneration, incorporating a
linking of business and education.
Tomorrow's workshops will include a session where delegates will use a
number of work stations to investigate the range of learning material
available under a scheme from the US which has been used in the past
year by Northfield Academy in Aberdeen.
The school's David Eastwood, along with Raey Currie of Grampian
Enterprise, will demonstrate the ''expert learning'' computer-assisted
system which helps pupils develop and improve basic literacy and
numeracy.
Moves to improve what were seen as poor standards of interview
technique among many of Ayrshire's young people will also be explained
at a workshop led by the county's EBP entitled ''Positive Steps to
Recruitment''.
The two-year project was instigated by partners from both education
and business and resulted in an intensive two-day programme, supported
by a pack of materials, designed to prepare young people for the
interview situation from start to finish.
Tomorrow's issue sessions will have a number of contributions from the
US, including one from Dekalb College on how the education and business
sectors should handle the challenge of tough and sensitive
communications problems at a time of tremendous change.
Ian Dale, of the Quality In Scotland Foundation, will speak of the
need for people at all levels in industry and education to convince our
children of the competitiveness of the international marketplace.
An interesting contribution from America will be Robert Kanoy's
exposition of TWIG, a partnership of two high schools, seven businesses,
and his own University of North Carolina, formed to develop educational
strategies and integrate business skills into the curriculum.
The topical subject of teacher placement will be dealt with by Clare
Marsh of the Teacher Placement Service, Scotland, who will examine the
experiences of more than 50 teachers in Strathclyde who have followed a
structured programme examining total quality management in industry.
And the way things are going in industry, with companies
''down-sizing'' and the number of small businesses and sole traders
growing, is the focus of a session by Mhairi Robertson of Dunbartonshire
EBP and Ian McGregor of Dumbarton District Enterprise Trust on the need
for EBPs to interact with local businesses of all sectors and sizes.
Friday's Steal And Share sessions will again feature a number of
overseas contributions. One, from Ken Baker of the New Zealand
Enterprise Trust, will tell how 14-year-olds there organise and
implement community projects. In New Zealand, more than half of the
secondary schools have at least one Young Enterprise team, so there are
some strong similarities with Scotland.
Glasgow's selection as City of Architecture and Design for the year
1999 will be in focus at a session by Bart Biagini of Strathclyde
Regional Council, who will outline a strategy by the Glasgow EBP to link
all schools in the city with architecture and design companies to
support innovative projects involving thousands of young people.
Other contributions will come from GIFT (the Georgia Industrial
Fellowships for Teachers), The Engelmann Institute of Missouri, Argyll
and Bute TVEI on employment options in rural communities, Lothian Region
Careers Service on primary-teacher business placements, and the BP
Tutoring Scheme.
These and many others too numerous to mention are bound to make this
unique international conference an occasion to remember -- and one which
will greatly benefit an already burgeoning and important movement
towards educating our young people in the realities of work and life in
a new millennium.

SOME of the conference delegates are to go back to school for an hour
or so but they won't have to worry about annoying the ''teacher'' -- for
he will be in Canada. A live link-up, using two telephone lines and the
latest in communications hardware and software, will permit an
interactive learning exchange using 4ft x 3ft SMART boards which are
touch-sensitive.
The equipment is already in use in the remote areas of New Brunswick
province, where local commerce has joined with the education authorities
to sponsor a hi-tech educational service.
A full infrastructure of teaching and learning materials is in place
and it was felt that conference delegates should have the opportunity
not only to see the process in action but also to take part to some
extent.
Two Canadians -- Mr Ian Forsyth, a fellow of Mount Allison University,
New Brunswick, and Mr Paul Leahey, principal of Centreville Intermediate
School -- will be demonstrating the equipment via the live link-up at
about 5pm tomorrow and it is hoped to give a further demonstration on
Saturday morning.
Mr Robert Burns, manager of the Dumfries and Galloway EBP, feels the
delegates will be interested in a scheme which brings the latest
educational advantages to youngsters in remote areas, and allows them to
learn about business tools such as spreadsheets in an interactive
situation.
If a spreadsheet is opened up at one end of the link-up, it is seen at
the other and both participants can work on it.
Loudspeakers will help tomorrow's link-up and delegates will have a
chance to touch the ''white board'' themselves, participating in a
memorable communications experience.
''The demonstration will be part of a broad range of experiences for
delegates, all of whom are interested in the furtherance of education in
all kinds of environment,'' says Burns.
He has been closely involved in the experiment, which comes courtesy
of SMART suppliers Selcom Technologies Ltd of Guildford in Surrey.

San Marino,
SCOTLAND are firm favourites to dismantle the massed defensive ranks
of San Marino in the Serravalle Stadium this evening and score goals.
Better not watch alone, though, just in case history repeats itself.
The story of Scottish football is littered with the wreckage of broken
dreams, shocking defeats by unfancied opposition.
The Republic of San Marino is an idyllic spot, the perfect place in
which to become complacent, but Craig Brown dismisses the notion that
fate may be conspiring to set his players up for one of those heavy
falls. ''I have no fear of defeat here. I don't think it is a
possibility,'' he said.
The manager's optimism is matched by that of his players, who are
relaxed and smiling ''but ready to go'' stressed the captain, Gary
McAllister.
''Defeat? No, I don't think there is any chance of that,'' added John
Collins, another of the midfield players who will be supplying the front
players John McGinlay, Duncan Shearer, and Pat Nevin.
However, the passing game with which Brown has been persevering will
be put on hold in the belief that more significant progress will be made
via an aerial route. ''I have been encouraging the players to pass the
ball, but this time I am asking them to get the ball into San Marino's
box early and challenge for it there,'' Brown said.
''Our players should be prepared to wait for the opposition to make
mistakes, to push on to loose balls. We have the skill to play our way
through most sides, but San Marino won't want to play us. They will have
up to eight players between us and their goal.''
The plan is to deliver the ball at angles from in and around San
Marino's penalty box. Both McAllister and Collins will play vital roles
in that sense with Nevin always running from wide positions trying to
hit the line and flight passes over for Shearer and McGinlay. ''Our
people are going to have to impose themselves and make sure they are
first to the knock-downs and poor clearances,'' said Brown.
Brown will opt for Darren Jackson, a striker who often plays in
Hibernian's midfield, instead of Billy McKinlay in the middle of the
pitch, pointing out that in Collins and McAllister the team already has
players who use the ball well, and he wants to see Jackson surging from
deep positions. ''I want him getting into the box as San Marino and even
our strikers are moving out,'' Brown explained.
''Jackson is a livelier player than McKinlay and it is harder for
defenders to track his movements. I am hoping Jackson will run with the
ball through their defence and can also time his runs to latch on to
passes behind defenders.''
Jackson is realistic enough to know he is in only because Brown has so
many absentees in players such as McCoist, Booth, Gallacher, Jess,
Ferguson, and Durie, but the Hibs striker intends staking a most potent
claim.
The player with the second highest number of caps, Aberdeen's Stewart
McKimmie, who has played for Scotland 32 times -- Jim Leighton is the
most capped member of the squad with 63 -- also will be left on the
bench because Brown is determined to present his most attack-minded side
yet. He will have only two defenders, Colin Calderwood and Colin Hendry,
who will be allowed a degree of freedom. He will have a licence to push
forward whenever he feels it necessary with Tommy Boyd dropping back as
a precaution. Hendry also will be expected to win many of the deliveries
from free kicks into San Marino's penalty area.
Alan McLaren will operate just in front of the defensive two and a
little to the right to patrol an area into which San Marino's Marco
Mularoni has been known to arrive unexpectedly.
The manager's only note of caution came when he mentioned the referee,
Loizos Loizou, of Cyprus, who will be taking charge of his first
international match. ''He might be too eager to impress UEFA's German
delegate Volker Roth and we have a several players who are already on
one yellow card,'' the manager said.
The players in question are Hendry, McGinlay, Collins, McKimmie, and
McKinlay.
* RUSSIA, who dropped two points when they were held to a 0-0 draw at
home by Scotland last month, must beat Group 8 leaders Greece in Athens
tonight to retain a realistic chance of reaching the finals.
Greece beat Russia 1-0 when they met in a World Cup qualifier in
Athens in November, 1993 and a similiar result tonight effectively would
guarantee the Greeks a place in the finals, leaving Russia on the
sidelines.
Finland (9) and Scotland (8) both have more points than the Russians
(5), who have two games in hand.

Like the culinary delight of the moreish, rich fruit Selkirk Bannock,
this Borders town on the A7 is often underrated. The royal burgh's many
claims to fame include associations with Sir Walter Scott, who worked in
the courtrooms for 30 years, explorer Mungo Park, and 80 local men who
rallied to the call of James IV at Flodden the only one to return
brought the captured English standard. Locals mark this proud tradition
at the summer Common Riding.
Textiles brought industrial expansion to the town in the nineteenth
century and, though in recession, mills like Laidlaw &amp; Fairgreaves have
survived. Above all, Selkirk was a shoe manufacturing town which is why
natives are called Souters shoemakers. Nowadays the town relies on new
industries, such as glassmaking at Selkirk Glass, electronics at Exacta
and MEPD, and tourism with Halliwells Museum at the Market Square and
the magnificent art collection at Bowhill House.
Selkirk's housing is unusually well integrated, with council houses
next to private homes and no stigma attached to either. Most of the
population of 7000 lives on the terraced hillside above the Ettrick
Water, and property offers outstanding value. Ranald Bruce, at Taylor
Bruce &amp; Co, says: 'A stone-built detached family house costs about
A80,000, about half the price in the cities.
'It is still very much a buyer's market and the further up in price
you go, the slower it tends to be. You can get a really good two-bedroom
flat for A25,000 to A35,000, and ex-local authority property sells well
at about A40,000 for a three- bedroom home.'
There are few large houses, and most millowners' mansions have been
converted. Many in the professional sectors of Selkirk society do not
move for many years, and there tends to be a price ceiling for larger
homes around A90,000.
Derek Binnie, at General Accident in Galashiels, says: 'A long-term
massive need for family homes in Selkirk is being met by new-build such
as the Ladylands Estate by local builder J.S. Crawford. You can get a
two-bedroom semi there for A53,000 to A55,000, and a three-bedroom semi
for A60,000.'
Other new-build includes the Morrison Homes development at
Philiphaugh, bungalows by Rodgers at Murieston Hill on the outskirts,
Oregon Homes at Haining Park, and the second phase of modern bungalows
by Crawfords at Deer Park, selling at around A100,000
Lynne Knox, at John Sale, says: 'There is a wide choice of homes by
popular Borders builders on nice sites throughout the town.'
Selkirk's three primary schools (Knowepark, Philiphaugh and St
Joseph's) and one secondary (Selkirk High), are all highly regarded.
The town is surrounded by rolling countryside, notably the valleys of
Yarrick and Ettrick, perfect for hillwalking and fishing. The walk to
the Three Brethren is one of the most popular.
There is a good range of local shops for everyday needs, with family
bakers and butchers aplenty, and two supermarkets, Presto and Co-op.
Galashiels and Melrose are a short drive away, offering an extended
choice of places to work, shop and play. Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle
and Carlisle are all within 90 minutes by road.
Rugby plays an important part in the community with a number of clubs
and pitches, and the town's team is well supported. There are also
football grounds, cricket fields and a nine-hole golf course on Selkirk
Hill.
A caravan and camping site is located next to the recently refurbished
municipal swimming pool and fitness centre at Victoria Park.

THE number of city-centre flats to let in Edinburgh is increasing
also, but for reasons different to those governing the changes in
Glasgow.
As the office needs of the big financial institutions outstrip their
traditional lairs around Charlotte Square, smaller but related firms
like solicitors and accountants having been moving into the more coveted
business addresses. There the chain stops, because their vacant offices
in the surrounding New Town are being snapped up not by more businesses
but by developers who are returning them to their original function.
The days of a three or four-storey town house per family are over, but
the beautifully-proportioned buildings are increasingly valued as flats
with a rare degree of space plus the advantages of being able to walk to
work and to all the cultural pleasures of the city.
The potential was spotted a few years ago by two brothers, who
refurbished their student flat, sold it and moved into the New Town. Ali
and Mike Afshar were sent to school in Scotland from Tehran. They stayed
on as students at Heriot Watt when revolution made it impossible to
return home, and Edinburgh is now home and a city they cherish, not just
mentally but materially.
The business they set up to combine their expertise in engineering and
surveying, and which now includes two younger brothers also sent to
school in Scotland, has been responsible for the renovation of
significant parts of the New Town. They are confident that the demand
for city-centre flats is increasing.
''People like to live in the city and they also like the idea that
more buildings are returning to residential use so that there are people
about at night. No-one likes to walk along a street of closed offices in
the dark, but if there are houses with lights on, it has quite a
different feel,'' says Ali Afshar.
That change in atmosphere will follow from their newest development at
Palmerston Place, where seven inter-connecting town houses which had
been used as offices for Scottish Homes are being converted into 28
flats. Work begins on site on May 8.
Recognising that the rental market is buoyant in Edinburgh, too, and
expecting it to increase, they are considering keeping half the
development for rental.
They have in the past let one or two flats in some developments,
mainly to meet the local demand from the big financial institutions for
temporary accommodation for mobile managers and for people on training
courses.
''People whose jobs make them very mobile now prefer to rent than to
buy and I think that market is increasing,'' says Dr Afshar.
Letting the two flats they own to other people and renting a third for
themselves is the best way of affording the kind of spacious Edinburgh
flat Susan Castle and her husband wanted.
''We each owned a flat in Leith before we married and we lived in one
of the flats for a while, but it really was a one-person flat. We saw
this flat advertised and it was a lot bigger than we could afford to
buy, so we let out the other two and rented this one,'' says Susan.
All three letting transactions are done through the same agent, who
collects the rent from the smaller flats, deducts the cost of the large
flat and sends the couple a monthly cheque for the difference of about
A20.
''It overcame all the problems of selling and buying and paying legal
fees. We saw the flat one week and moved in the next and the only cost
was for a removal van,' says Susan.

I WAS interested to read Ruth Wishart's admiring profile of that
leading light of the Scottish legal profession, Cameron Fyfe (April 21).
But I was puzzled by the quote that he is a ''David looking for new
Goliaths to conquer''.
On behalf of a campaign group for men's issues to which I belong, I
asked Mr Fyfe's firm, by phone, in October 1993, if they would be
prepared to act for us to obtain judicial review against the Equal
Opportunities Commission.
This was on account of the EOC's persistent refusal to take up the
issue of discrimination which men face in court on divorce and custody
(the very letter of the law denies unmarried fathers equal rights with
unmarried mothers). The EOC has ignored this despite the fact that over
one million British fathers are currently affected.
Mr Fyfe (modern-day David) replied, via his junior assistant: ''There
isn't a lawyer in Scotland who would take on this case.'' When I
protested, his assistant added: ''We have our own interests to
consider.''
After this call, I reflected ruefully that the Scottish legal
profession has no qualms about defending murderers, alleged Lockerbie
bombers, child molesters, but, according to Mr Fyfe, it would not be
bold enough to help Scots dads seeking equal rights.
Fortunately, I did manage to find a Glasgow solicitor who is prepared
to take on the Goliath of the EOC. Unfortunately, no member of the
Faculty of Advocates would.

GLASGOW-based PCT Group yesterday announced record pre-tax profits of
#1.58m for 1994 but prepared shareholders for little growth this year.
Profits rose 7.5% in the 12 months to end-December and the engineering
group raised its total dividend by 6.2% to 7.7p, after a final payout of
5p.
PCT, which boosted turnover by 3.9% to #22.0m, said trading in the UK
remained difficult throughout 1994, particularly during the second half.
The group's shares closed up 2p on 154p, even though the company said
UK activity levels had remained relatively flat during the first quarter
of this year.
Chairman Stuart Wilson said: ''It is our expectation that the group
will experience little growth during the current year, despite the
benefit of overhead reductions and margin improvements.''
The main engine which drove profits higher was French subsidiary
Victory International, the manufacturer of manual lifting equipment
acquired by PCT for about #300,000 in March last year. It contributed
more than #500,000 before tax.
PCT, which secured tax breaks from the French Government as a result
of the purchase, incurred a tax charge of only 17.1% last year, compared
with 31.8% in 1993.
Earnings per share consequently leapt 29% to 14.55p. With the
favourable tax charge assisted by overseas factors which are unlikely to
be fully repeated, PCT pointed out that the same level of growth in EPS
would not be achievable during 1995.
PCT, which has another subsidiary in the Irish Republic, manufactures
and hires power tools, and lifting and welding equipment, as well as
consumables.

The giant yew tree standing sentinel beside Kennox House is believed
to date back to around the time of the Norman Conquest
KENNOX HOUSE is an architectural gem - and someone used a diamond some
250 years ago to scratch a short religious poem on to the staircase
window. Built in 1720 on the outskirts of Stewarton, the A-listed
property has seen several additions to its original lay-out over the
years, some of which were carried out to the designs of William Morris,
the socialist designer and poet.
Set among fine old woods in a curve of the River Glazert, Kennox comes
with 35 acres of ground and about half a mile of fishing rights.
Close to the house is a remarkably large yew tree which is said to be
over 900 years old, yet is still in hearty good growth.
''This house really is something special,'' says Susan Margetts of Roy
Slater's Shawlands branch. ''We've had a lot of inquiries about it, but
so far there has been no serious interest. Anyone who goes to see it
will be thrilled by its architecture, its interiors and its lovely
grounds.''
The property comprises six bedrooms, four public rooms, a self
contained flat, and a large cellar. The current owner is a keen horsey
type and the American-style stable block has six loose boxes, an
equestrian exercise yard, and a separate tack room. The property also
comes with enclosed paddocks.
The public rooms include a billiards room with some elegant cornicing,
a marble fireplace and parquet flooring. The drawing room has windows to
the front and side overlooking the river.
The verse etched onto the staircase windows reads:
Blest as the immortal God is he,
The youth who fondly sits by thee
And hears and sees thee all the while
Softly speak and sweetly smile.
The next owner of Chapeltoun House can sweetly smile with the
satisfaction of owning a very special home. As for the price, agents Roy
Slater prefer to ''softly speak'' by omitting it from the adverts and
the marketing brochure.
But if you are blest with the ability to pay #365,000, or more, you
can scratch out your own favourite verse on the windows overlooking The
Glazert.

REFEREES in next month's World Cup will not use yellow and red cards
to signal warnings or sendings-off.
Sir Ewart Bell, chairman of Rugby World Cup, announcing the officials,
said: ''I was expecting that the card system would be used, but the
International Board has not agreed to the general adoption of the
experiment. The IB has not made up its mind and wants further tests. We
did not think that the Rugby World Cup was the place to experiment.''
Any player sent off seems certain to miss the rest of the tournament.
The lowest recommended suspension for a dismissed player is 30 days for
punching -- and the event lasts just one month.
Any player dismissed or cited will have his case adjudicated by a
single commissioner, who will be a member of the IB executive council.
Guilty players will be flown home.
In the first two World Cup competitions there were only two dismissals
each time.
Welshman Derek Bevan, who was in charge of the final between Australia
and England, will officiate when hosts South Africa play holders
Australia in the opening match in Cape Town. Referees have so far been
appointed only for the opening two rounds of games.
England have the two officials with whom they are most accustomed.
Scotland's Jim Fleming referees their match against Argentina on May 27
and Ireland's Stephen Hilditch is in charge when they play the Italians
on May 31. Wales will have Argentina's Ephraim Sklar in charge when they
open against Japan. and England's Ed Morrison takes control of Wales v
New Zealand.
Scotland's opening fixture against Ivory Coast will be taken by Felise
Vito, of Western Samoa, and the Scots' game against Tonga is to be
refereed by Australian Barry Leask.
Ireland have the other Australian referee, Wayne Erickson, when they
start against New Zealand. Their match against Japan will be controlled
by South African Stef Neethling.

Is it cheaper to rent or to buy? The recent maxim that buying is
better probably holds good only for those who stay put for five years or
more. At first glance the table below indicates that buyers have the
better bargain, but other costs which should be added to the mortgage
figure include legal fees for buying, selling costs, the price of
curtains and carpets, a wear and tear cost, building insurance and
probably a factor's fee for a west end flat in Glasgow.
.......Value.......................Mortgage..................Rent
.......# 30,000.....................#205.....................#300
.......# 40,000.....................#295.....................#375
.......# 60,000.....................#464.....................#500
.......#100,000.....................#810.....................#650
These figures are based on a 25-year-old male repaying an endowment
over 25 years with an interest rate of 8.5% and include mortgage
interest tax relief. His additional costs -- assuming buying and selling
within two years -- would amount to #7700, estimated Stephen O'Neill.
.......Legal fees..........#1000
.......Carpets, curtains...#2500
.......Selling fees........#2000
.......Factor..............#1000
.......Wear and tear.......#1000
.......Building insurance..# 200
.......Total...............#7700
On a #40,000 flat, he could estimate a #2000 profit after two years,
reducing costs to #5700. Those spread over 24 months amount to #235 per
month which brings the real cost of the #295 mortgage to #530 a month.

BLACKBIRDS nested in my garden and the young left the nest on Easter
Monday. The adults have been feeding them in my own and my neighbours'
gardens.
By Wednesday, they divided their time between doing that and
rebuilding the nest, picking up alternately grubs to stuff into the
fledglings and vegetation to stuff into the nest.
The mother now seems confused, continually offering twigs to her
young, even following them about to do so.
Is this disturbed behaviour, or is it all right?

LORN McIntyre is to be congratulated on the review of Irvine Welsh --
and his contemporary novelists, too (April 22). ''Much of modern
urban-based Scottish fiction'' is the New Calvinism, writes McIntyre.
That perception eluded Booker. It has eluded many, including me, who
have struggled to understand. It is apt beyond words.
The bleakness of Welsh and Kelman, their lack of all hope, is bad
enough. That their chosen patois from the urban hinterlands should be
mistaken for Doric Scots is even worse.
I went back to Lewis Grassic Gibbon to see if today's writers might be
a continuum. The contrast was striking: they have failed utterly to do
for their chosen field what Gibbon did for his.
Lorn McIntyre closed with: ''suddenly I realised what is missing in
Welsh and his contemporaries is the flyting voice of old Scotland, harsh
but ultimately healthy and progressive.''
That voice was what Chris heard as she sat and looked up at Bennachie
on the last page of Grey Granite.

IT must be hard for a brilliant young man like Conor O'Reilly to be
turned down for the university place he had set his heart on to study
medicine, especially if it's the first ''knock back'' he's ever had. It
probably feels like the end of the world (April 19).
Nevertheless, it isn't, and I feel it's wrong for his father to try to
pull strings to get him into Glasgow. The university had its reasons for
refusing Conor and has offered to let him know what they are, so he
should write to them and find out why he didn't get in.
Two things which occur to me, from the report, are his youth and his
lack of life experience outwith a medical atmosphere. I understand both
his parents are doctors.
Once he knows why he didn't get a place, he can then fill in the gaps
in his experience and apply again for 1996, when he will still only be
18.
I am reminded of a friend of my mother whose two sons were brought up
in a military background. One of them applied to join the army at 16. He
had all the qualifications but was told to go and do something else for
a year then apply again. He did and was then accepted.
Unless he takes up one of his other offers, Conor has a year or more
to put some experience under his belt. Getting a job (himself, not
organised by dad) or joining an organisation like Community Service
Volunteers, which brings him into contact with the people he wants, as a
doctor, to help, will mature him and give him something to write about
and talk about next year.
It will probably make him a better doctor, too.

PETER Nicol sets out on a double mission in this week's European
championship in Amsterdam, aiming to retain his unbeaten international
record as well as help Scotland recapture the title.
The 22-year-old from Inverurie was almost unknown when he helped
Scotland win the title for a first time three years ago. But he now is
the world No.5 and, in the absence through illness of world No.2, Peter
Marshall, the highest ranked player on show this week.
With world No.38 Martin Heath, Barry Sutherland, Dave Gordon, and
newcomer Stuart Cowie as back-up, there is every chance that the Scots,
bronze medallists a year ago, can achieve victory.
''I'll be disappointed if we don't at least get silver,'' said manager
Pat Nicol, Peter's father. ''I would like to see us get through to
Sunday's final and have a real go at the English.''
Finland, Germany, and Holland provide the group opposition, and it
should be a formality for the side to finish in the top two and reach
the semi-final stage.
The Scottish women also are hopeful of returning with a medal. It is
10 years since the side won bronze in Barcelona, and Alison Bowie, who
will become the first Scottish woman to win 100 caps if she plays in all
five matches, survives from that side.
Sisters Senga and Helen Macfie and Scottish champion Claire Waddell
complete the line-up, with England, Ireland, and Sweden as opposition.
Scotland's hopes of reaching the last four have been helped by the
withdrawal of England's world No.2 Suzanne Horner.

Orchestras can strike a better balance if they return to
nineteenth-century practices, argues CONRAD WILSON
IF THE world of orchestral music has produced a recent trend --
beyond, at any rate, the sound of falling subsidies and threatened
mergers -- it has been the radical reseating of the symphony orchestra.
Britain, admittedly, has largely sheltered itself from this, regarding
it as just another foreign fad, and thus something to be shunned.
Indeed, in a land where orchestras are fighting for survival, the
question of where to place the cellos and basses on a concert platform
may seem somewhat frivolous.
But as last year's Edinburgh Festival resoundingly demonstrated,
orchestral seating, and how it affects the balance of a performance, is
being seriously rethought in Germany, Scandinavia, and the United
States, even if it is not yet a priority here.
What, in brief, has been happening is that more and more orchestras
are returning to the old nineteenth-century pattern whereby the first
and second violins sit opposite each other, to the left and right of the
conductor, with the violas and cellos in the middle and a line of double
basses facing out into the audience along the back of the platform.
This is not just change for change's sake. The splitting of the
violins, both aurally and visually, helps listeners to hear their
interplay more easily than in the established modern arrangement, which
bunches them together on the conductor's left.
Many composers, not only Beethoven and Brahms but Haydn and Mozart
before them, wrote their music so as to take advantage of this
separation. The players could respond to each other in a way that used
to be called antiphonal but which we would today prefer to describe as
stereophonic.
Reminders of what that can sound like were provided at the Edinburgh
Festival by the NDR Radio Orchestra, the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra,
the Cleveland Orchestra, and even -- on the night John Nelson conducted
it -- the London Philharmonic.
Although the placing of the basses on each occasion was slightly
off-centre, at least they faced outwards. The violins were divided. And
in Gunter Wand's performances of Beethoven with his German orchestra,
they firmly buttressed the grand nineteenth-century architecture of his
interpretations.
John Nelson's decision to reseat the LPO for Schumann's Scenes From
Faust may have been more controversial, since players tend to deplore,
and report themselves ''unsettled'' by, such an upheaval for the sake of
a single concert. Sitting in an unfamiliar place on the platform, they
claim that they do not hear the sounds and balances they normally
expect, and that as a result the performance suffers.
Sir Adrian Boult, a famed supporter of the nineteenth-century layout,
used to insist that the SNO change positions whenever he appeared in
Scotland as guest conductor. Otto Klemperer did the same with the
Philharmonia in London. Edo de Waart took up the cause when he became
musical director of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
Alexander Lazarev, conducting the Royal SNO in Schoenberg's Verklarte
Nacht this season, placed a line of double basses along the back of the
platform, to magnificently sonorous effect. Heinz Holliger, conducting
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra in Haydn's London symphony last week,
placed the first violins on his left and the seconds on his right, thus
highlighting the differentiation between their parts.
As Boult once put it: ''I hold very strong views and am constantly
shocked at the present orchestral arrangement, which makes things a bit
easier for conductors and players but gives a crooked picture of the
music to most of the audience.''
Which British symphony orchestra will be the first to give us back the
nineteenth-century layout?
Hugh Macdonald, BBC Scotland's director of music, says the BBC
Scottish Symphony Orchestra experimented with the nineteenth-century
layout for two or three months last year, with results positive enough
-- and in Berlioz's Waverley overture startling enough -- to make him
consider reverting to it on a more permanent basis.
Roy McEwan of the SCO is equally open-minded, and Paul Hughes of the
Royal SNO says he was sufficiently impressed with Lazarev's reseating of
the strings to consider opening discussions with the players themselves.

STEPHEN McGINTY reports on the prize-winning stamps of GSA student
Sarah Wilson
YOU won't find Tucker Jenkins on the award-winning stamps designed by
Glasgow School of Art student Sarah Williams. Instead Postman Pat, Brian
the Snail, Andy Pandy and Paddington Bear receive the tiny commemorative
treatment. Grange Hill's own wild child was taboo viewing, by decree of
Sarah's mum.
''We were horrified when it first came on,'' said Mrs Williams.
''Yeh, I was one of those kids who had to ask around the playground to
see what happened because we never knew,'' explains Sarah.
Perhaps it's just as well. An iconic image of Tucker chucking chairs
out of the classroom might not have wooed the judges the way the swift
and simple line drawings of everyone's TV favourites did. In fact Sarah
drew hundreds of tiny sketches on A1 paper in a bid to capture the true
essence of the characters before switching to an AppleMac for the final
product with its background wash.
The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and
Commerce picked her as the winner of the award to design stamps to
celebrate 50 years of children's television and she collects her
certificate and cheque at a presentation in London today.
Her only regret is that the #1000 travel award won't stretch to
Madagascar as she had hoped, so now the rainforests of South America are
drawing her.
''I want to see it because it's going to be lost and I want my work to
convince people to try and save it.''
Environmental and social issues are of great concern to the
24-year-old final-year student from Lancashire. Her part-time work as a
care assistant in an old folk's home has ignited an interest in the
potential of art therapy as a possible career.
Her social conscience surfaced in her classwork when she was asked to
a write and illustrate a children's book.
''It's about a battery hen that runs away to live with free-range hens
and has three chicks with a rooster,'' said Sarah. Aimed at
five-year-olds, she believes that is the age to instill in children a
degree of dignity about their surroundings.
It's a small step from there to mourning the passing of Paddington
Bear from stop-motion puppet to corny cartoon.
''Today Mr and Mrs Brown move, they aren't just cardboard cut-outs.
It's an end of an era. What children have today is so violent -- just
look at Power Rangers.''
Mrs Williams agrees and we all shake our heads. Children's programmes
from the shkadoom-shkadoom of Ivor The Engine to Postman Pat's black and
white cat are being cut and re-created as vacant slick action.
It was the attributes of Paddington Bear that made him Sarah's
favourite. ''He was just a bit dizzy like me, tripping over his suitcase
and leaving the bath taps running. Plus I love the way he wrinkles his
nose.''
Her inspirations include Quentin Blake and the Australian designer Ken
Done for his bright colours and simple lines. Sarah hopes her next
project may well be another children's book wrapped round a topical
message.
''It'll be about a veal calf who manages to escape from a lorry and
heads to India because that is where cows are sacred.''

THE dark rumours may be growing about his future but the man himself,
Ally McCoist, has no doubts at all about what lies ahead of him.
''I will not only be playing football next season but the season after
that,'' he said yesterday, as he performed one of his numerous PR
duties, helping to launch a new in-house radio station at Glasgow's
Southern General Hospital.
The news that McCoist, who has played very little top-team football in
the past two years because of persistent injury which followed a broken
leg, had withdrawn from a reserve game at the weekend and will see a
specialist this week has inevitably prompted speculation that his career
is in danger.
He is well aware of that but insists: ''It is all nonsense, though I
have no doubt it will go on over the next couple of months. Put it this
way: I could play right now but my priority is to be fit for next
season.''
McCoist pointed out that some people are assuming that the injury that
is niggling him at present is the same one that caused him to be absent
for long periods over the past two seasons.
''That is not the case. It is an ankle injury, different altogether
from the calf problem I had before. That's why, although I'm concerned,
I'm not in any way worried about the future.''
McCoist is to see a London specialist tomorrow because he wants an
expert judgment on the treatment of the ankle which still gives him
slight pain when he tries to kick the ball.
The striker has not had his problems to seek since he broke a leg
playing for Scotland against Portugal in Lisbon in April, 1993, but he
has been convinced for some time that, once the current series of
injuries are conquered, he will be able to play even longer than he had
anticipated.
The Scottish internationalist has already worked out that the recent
long absences from top-team football have left him with an engine
capable of running longer than might have been the case. All being well,
he can see a few years yet at the sharp end of the game.
* CELTIC will have a final look at #2m target Marc Degryse in Brussels
tonight when the Belgian skipper leads his nation against Cyprus in a
European Championship match.
If the Anderlecht striker shapes up well, Celtic will try to push
through the deal as swiftly as possible.

THANKS to my friend Jim Fiddes, whose company, Ryden, are sponsoring
the East of Scotland cricket league for the nineteenth consecutive year,
I was asked to a dinner this week at which George Goddard was given a
presentation. The recipient is the man who has rightly been dubbed as
the finest off-spinner Scotland has produced.
Goddard played for more than 40 years, man and boy, in the East
League, almost always for Heriot's, and I have known him since we played
schools rugby against each other. He is a modest, unassuming chap, as
befits an Edinburgh accountant, but also a fierce and wily competitor
who always plays fair but hard.
His long-time friend and team-mate, Hamish More, is the only Scot to
rival him in the longevity stakes. Hamish has been a bit under the
weather of late and we wish him well.
When George retired at the end of last season he had acquired some 63
full Scottish caps plus 15 appearances for his country in the Benson and
Hedges and Nat-West competitions. A former international captain, he
claimed 154 victims at the highest level, 1400 in club games, and at
least another 500 in various matches. The lad could turn his arm.
In his final season, and much to his delight, Heriot's lifted the East
League title, no little thanks to him. His other club was Murrayfield,
for whom he played, and bowled pretty quickly, while he was still at
school.
At 57, he looks as fit as a flea. ''I may play in the odd social game
but basically I am looking forward to a lazy summer. It is quite nice to
wait until about two o'clock on a Saturday afternoon to decide what I am
going to do.''
Are we Scots getting any better at this bat-and-ball lark, I wished to
know? ''Just for the record, there are more cricket clubs in Scotland
than rugby clubs,'' he pointed out, his retaliation going in first.
''Yes, we almost certainly have improved at international level -- but
then so has everyone else. It would be strange indeed if a largely
amateur side like ourselves could match the increased skills of the
professionals.
''I suppose if the players of my generation had trained harder, had a
couple of pints fewer, we would have performed to a higher standard. We
had a lot of fun, though.''
Did he ever think of turning pro? After all, the South African who
played with such distinction for Scotland, Omar Henry, had little doubt
George could have made it at first-class level.
''It just wasn't an option. My career path dictated I had to serve in
an office for five years before qualifying. That was the period when a
county might have wanted me to play for them.''
So he settled instead for a glittering amateur career. He captained
his country, he went on tour in West Africa with MCC, played with or
against such as Colin Cowdrey, Mike Brearley and Andy Roberts.
Many say George's finest hour was at Titwood in 1973. Bowling for
Scotland he took eight MCC wickets in the first innings, two in the
second, and scored a century after having come in at No.9. No other Scot
has done that.
''We still lost,'' he reminded me.
Goddard's batting was what first took him into the international side
and he scored more than 1000 runs for Scotland. Yet it was his
off-spinners, his ability to flight the ball, to bemuse so many batsmen,
which kept him there.
Why did he go on so long? ''I was lucky with injuries. Then, when I
was in my thirties, when a lot of my contemporaries were packing up, I
discovered I could still cope with the league games. I was enjoying it,
so why quit?''
I asked him about the arrival of Malcolm Marshall, the great West
Indian bowler, on the Scottish scene this season. A good move? ''Yes, of
course. Just playing alongside a bloke like Marshall will be wonderful
experience for our lads.''

NORMAN Williamson resumes his challenge for the jockeys' championship
at Perth today after having injured himself during a schooling session
and missing rides at Chepstow and Punchestown.
Williamson has rides in five of the six races at the start of the
three-day Perth Festival, which, with increased prize money of #90,000,
has attracted top-class fields including several runners trained by Kim
Bailey and John Edwards, both regular visitors to the Scone Palace
track.
With Adrain Maguire sidelined with a broken arm, Williamson is the
only serious contender for Richard Dunwoody's title. Although someway
behind the champion at present, Williamson has ridden 20 winners in the
past 28 days compared to Dunwoody's 10 and is catching up rapidly.
Williamson rode a winner for Bailey on the first day of this meeting
last year and will be fancied to repeat that success for his gaffer on
Upward Surge in the Tote Credit Maiden Chase.
Leading Scottish trainer Len Lungo has had a lean spell recently with
only one winner in the past three weeks.
Perth has always been a happy hunting ground for the Carrutherstown
man who will be hoping to get his bandwagon rolling again. Out of three
runners today his best chance of success would appear to be Judge and
Jury in the last, the amateur riders' handicap hurdle.
In preparation for 'summer racing' Perth has been watering over the
last week and recent heavy rain has ensured good going.

ALTHOUGH Sarah Gourlay failed a fitness test yesterday morning, and
had to drop out of the singles, Scotland, the Atlantic Rim Fours
champions, made a promising start to the defence of their title, beating
Namibia and Guernsey in Durban yesterday.
Janice Maxwell came out of the fours to fill Gourlay's singles berth,
and Eleanor Allan, Scotland's secretary and team manager, slotted in at
second in the fours, with Betty Maxwell moving up to play third to
Frances Whyte.
While Maxwell did not fare particularly well, losing 25-19 to
Namibia's Jean Joubert and 25-21 to Guernsey's Jean Martel, Whyte's four
notched up victories over Namibia, 22-12, and Guernsey 18-14.
The Scottish quartet made a disappointing start, trailing the
Namibians 8-2 after six ends, but scored nine shots without reply in
five ends to lead 11-8, and were never behind again.
Leading 15-12 after 18 ends, they piled up seven shots over the last
three to win 22-12, then controlled their next match against Sally
Paul's Guernsey quartet after having taken a 10-3 lead after eight ends.
The Channel Islanders fought back so well that they narrowed the gap
to just one shot, 15-14, with one end left to play, before the Scots
sealed their victory with a last end treble.

Ankara, Tuesday
TURKEY pulled out 20,000 more troops from northern Iraq but Prime
Minister Tansu Ciller warned today they were ready to return if needed
in the offensive against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels.
The latest pull-out leaves about 12,000 troops in Iraq. A brigade of
about 3000 withdrew in early April.
Analysts said Turkey was responding to Western pressure to end its
five-week-old offensive in northern Iraq but had no arrangements in
place to secure its borders against future infiltration from the
separatist guerrillas.
''If necessary we will enter one more time with the same
determination. Terrorism is the burden that the Gulf crisis left to
Turkey,'' Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told a meeting of her True Path
Party.
She said the aim was to break the PKK's chain of command and destroy
their plan to kill innocent people.
''No-one should expect that we would produce solutions specific to one
region or another,'' she added.
Turkish television showed an armoured column returning to Turkey from
the mountains of northern Iraq.
Military spokesman Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu told reporters that 20,000
had troops pulled out by today, taking to 23,000 the total withdrawn
since 35,000 crossed the border on March 20.
The outlawed PKK uses bases in northern Iraq in its separatist
insurgency in south-east Turkey. Nearly 11 years of war have cost more
than 15,000 lives.
The colonel said Turkish units would continue to try to rid the border
region of ''terrorists''.
The two main Iraqi Kurdish groups in northern Iraq welcomed the
pull-out, but called on Turkey to withdraw all its troops.
Turkey is seeking an agreement between the Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) to stop the Turkish
Kurds of the PKK using northern Iraq as a platform for attacks on
Turkey.
However the two Iraqi factions are more used to fighting each other
and analysts say a security agreement is unlikely to last.
In Strasbourg, the Council of Europe will vote tomorrow on a
resolution asking its governing committee to suspend Turkey ''unless it
shows progress towards a withdrawal from Iraq, a peaceful solution to
the Kurdish problem, and a reform of its constitution and legislation to
bring them into line with democratic norms''.
The council has adopted several resolutions demanding that Turkey
improve its human rights record, but this would be the first time it
imposed sanctions on Ankara.--Reuter.

Mutsu Ogawara, Tuesday
A JAPANESE provincial governor who refused to allow a British
freighter carrying nuclear waste to dock today lifted the ban in an
incident highlighting the controversy over Japan's nuclear programme.
The Pacific Pintail had to turn away from this northern Japanese port
after Aomori governor Hiroshi Kimura refused it entry just one hour
before it was scheduled to dock early this morning.
By this evening, the governor had lifted the order blocking the ship
after receiving a written promise from the government in Tokyo that it
will not to try to bury the toxic waste in his prefecture permanently.
''The ship will enter port tomorrow for spot checks,'' he told
reporters. The freighter was carrying 14 tonnes of radioactive waste
from France.
Kimura, a member of the opposition Shinshinto group who took office
just two months ago, had warned that he would block the freighter at the
end of a two-month voyage from France.
His adamant stand clearly caught the Japanese Government off-guard.
''We very much regret Governor Kimura's decision,'' said Makiko
Tanaka, head of the Science and Technology Agency, the Ministry
overseeing a nuclear programme that aims to use plutonium reprocessed
from spent uranium fuel.
''We can't tell the Pacific Pintail to take the waste back,'' said a
Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo.
Under the terms of a treaty between Japan, Britain, and France,
nuclear waste produced at a French reprocessing plant when spent
Japanese uranium fuel is reprocessed into plutonium, must be stored in
Japan.
The waste includes radioactive material such as strontium, with a
half-life of several million years, is mixed with glass and encased in
28 stainless steel canisters.
It is scheduled to be stored for 30 to 50 years at a special cooling
facility at Rokkasho, a village near Mutsu Ogawara, and then be buried
at an unspecified location.
Kimura's decision to deny the ship entry had delighted anti-nuclear
activists who had gathered at the port to protest the shipment.
The protesters sang anti-nuclear songs while about 1000 riot police
stood on alert around the port.
However the singing turned to anger and disappointment when they heard
that Kimura had backed down.
''It's very shocking,'' said Greenpeace spokeswoman Emi Ueno. ''We
don't understand what the governor wants to do. We're furious.''
''I'm sure they struck some kind of dubious secret deal,'' said
Jinzaburo Takagi, head of the Citizens' Nuclear Information Centre,
Japan's biggest anti-nuclear group.
He added: ''It's political lip service which can never serve as
genuine assurances.''
The stranded shipment was the first in a series.
Tokyo plans to eventually ship 7100 tonnes of spent fuel to France and
Britain for reprocessing into 30 tonnes of fuel-grade plutonium,
yielding 3000 tonnes of waste. Japan's 46 nuclear reactors currently
provide 30% of its power.
GORLEBEN: Riot police turned water cannon on demonstrators blocking a
nuclear waste storage depot in Gorleben, Germany, where a waste shipment
arrived safely today.
More than 6000 police were deployed in one of Germany's biggest
post-war police operations, which cost #13m.
The shipment, which had been unloaded from a train 12 miles from
Gorleben, was delayed all day as farmers blocked the road with tractors,
straw bales, and logs.
''I'll be back when the next shipment arrives,'' said farmer Diana
Marklewitz. ''At least this will give the government something to think
about.''--Reuter.

DUNDEE United's Dave Bowman may have to seek special SFA permission to
play in his own testimonial match.
The players' big day will be Sunday, August 6, when United meet Dundee
at Tannadice. And the former Scotland midfield man hopes he will still
be under suspension at that time.
Bowman, who is being honoured by United 10 years after having joined
them from Coventry City, starts a four-match SFA ban this week and still
will be under that suspension at the start of next season -- unless
United are involved in the league play-off.
''I hope that my team-mates can pick up enough points in the last
three games to climb the table and avoid relegation and the play-off,''
said Bowman. ''The main reason Dundee have been invited to supply the
opposition is the fact that we haven't met for a while -- and I think
both clubs want to keep it that way until August.
''We want to get out of second-bottom place in the premier division
and, equally, Dundee are hoping to come up from the first division as
champions. I believe the last thing either club wants is to be meeting
in the play-off.
''If we finish our season on schedule I will still be under suspension
at the time of my game and I will have to ask the SFA if they will
consider giving me clearance to play.''
Bowman's testimonial will not be quite as cut-throat as the possible
play-off showdown between the city rivals, but every effort will be made
to give his game as edge.
''Every local derby in this city is competitive,'' said Bowman, ''and
this will be no exception. There will be a trophy at stake and we will
attempt to limit the amount of substitutes used, because that often puts
a damper on pre-season games.''
There also will be a penalty shoot-out, if the teams finish level
after 90 minutes.

IN Switzerland, 70% of people rent their homes, and in Germany and
America the figure is about 40%. In Scotland it is 4%. That figure is
set to increase dramatically, according to one former estate agent who
switched to letting and managing property a year ago.
After 14 years in the business of selling houses, Stephen O'Neill
believes the action is in renting rather than buying.''We have had an
economic environment which has encouraged people to buy their own home.
I would like to see a better balance. We certainly do not need the 70%
owner-occupation there is in the south-east. I believe a healthy balance
would be something like 20% rented sector, 30% social sector (housing
associations and district councils) and 50% owner-occupation, he said.
He believes the fall in house prices was a snowball which started an
avalanche which will rearrange the housing market. While most of the
people who want to rent are still the traditional group of young people
setting out on both career and housing ladders, they are now likely to
be earning over #20,000 in O'Neill's experience. ''Previously they were
forced into an unsatisfactory rented sector with poor quality
properties. Our only prerequisite is that the house should be of a
decent standard and I can stand at the door and look the folk in the eye
when I am showing the flat. It does not matter whether it is a room and
kitchen in Partick as long as it is a decent room and kitchen. We try to
encourage landlords to change their attitude about the quality of
furnishing. As an owner-occupier you can choose to sit in a broken
chair, as a renter, you don't have to.''
O'Neill expects a growth in unfurnished accommodation as more people
see it as a stepping-stone from living with parents to owning their own
home. ''The bulk of people still want to own their own home, the
question is when. What has been a typical first-time buyer property is
the kind of flat I am now renting and I would expect to see a change
where the first-time buyer is more likely to go for a semi,
traditionally the next stage.''
He predicts further shift to the extent that building societies will
become providers of homes rather than providers of money, claiming that
some of the biggest are keeping very close watch on the rented sector
and are ready to invest. Already where houses have been repossessed,
building societies unable to recoup the value are letting.
''As an estate agent I was aware of uncomfortable buyers who were
buying to fulfil their short-term housing needs, but they knowing they
may leave in a year's time and have to extricate themselves, if they
were leaving in five years' time it would not be a problem, '' he aid.
An academic who has studied the private rented sector agres that it
will continue to increase. Kenneth Gibb of the Centre for Housing
Research and Urban Studies at the University of Glasgow. He says the
expansion began seven years ago when the deregulation of rents took
effect along with the extension of the Business Expansion Scheme to
property.
The BES (which ended in 1993) allowed people to invest up to #40,000 a
year and receive tax relief on the whole of that.As long as the money
remained in the project for five years, it was not subject to capital
gains tax when the shares were sold. Gibb descrbes it as a very generous
housing subsidy. ''People in other countries are amazed that it is only
necessary to invest over five years. They would expect a minimum of 15.
In the social sector, housing associations get bigger grants of 80% of
capital costs but that is over 60 years,'' he said.
The most notable housing consequences have been 80,000 new units of
housing for rent in the UK. These are mainly from new-build developments
which would otherwise be for owner-occupation. ''It has been very good
for developers but has allowed all the players, including estate agents
and solicitors, to remain in the game. Glasgow has had a
disproportionate amount of investment, based on the assumption that
there was more scope for growth. In 1988-89 there was a lot of
confidence in the property market,'' said Gibb.
Research by Mr Gibb based found that the private rented sector in
Glasgow more than doubled between 1988 and 1992 but that in real terms
rents remained constant. ''That shows a supply shift. -- The market has
become bigger, which is good for the consumer. The scheme was set up for
good housing policy and labour market reasons. We have now witnessed the
instability of the owner-occupied sector and a stronger private rented
sector means that young people have built up savings and are not so
exposed when they do take on mortgages. BES is no longer available, but
there should be a subsidy,'' he added.
He welcomes the suggestion by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that
there should be tax relief to enable pension funds to invest in
privately rented housing, because at present pension funds do not pay
tax, but points out that that would not necessarily provide sufficient
return for institutions which have to get the best return for their
pensioners.
In Scotland there is a mechanism for subsidy through the grow grants
given by Scottish Homes. These have been used almost to subsidise
developments for owner-occupation in areas, such as peripheral estates,
where they want a wider mix of tenure. Recently however they have also
gone to developers who want to build for rent on the open market as well
as to the housing associations whose function has been to provide
housing for particular social needs.
The first such grant in the west of Scotland went to Caledonian Rented
Homes, a company set up to develop property for rent. Their developmemt
of 18 flats in Burgh Hall Street, Partick, has a Scottish Homes grow
grant of 35% of the #1.1m development cost. There are strings attached
in that the developers are allowed only a certain yield before money is
clawed back.
Sean Robinson, a director of the company, said: ''The market place
dictates what the rent is. Scottish Homes are aiming to kick-start the
private rental sector with the idea that it will eventually support
itself. With capital values increasing by no more than inflation, more
people will start to look at private renting as a realistic option.''
He expects that the traditional demand from young people leaving home
or at the stage in their careers when they move around a lot to be
augmented soon by retired people who want to realise the capital value
of their house and be able to leave the management and maintenance of
the property to someone else. Their confidence meantime in the extent of
the market is evidences by two further developments in Glasgow, one of
47 flats at Berkely Street, Charing Cross and one of 24 in North
Kelvinside.
Only in particular pockets, but most notably in Glasgow's Merchan Ciy,
has the slump in house prices in he South of England affeced Scotland.
Owners letting while waiting for an upturn in the property market have
produced an upturn in ciy centre flats to rent.

San Marino 0, Scotland 1
TOMMY Craig's Under-21 Scottish side moved into joint leadership of
their European Championship qualifying group with Finland, but the
performance was disappointing even though the manager was reluctant to
be critical as a couple of hundred supporters trudged away from the
Serravalle Stadium with their colours trailing behind.
Hopefully, the senior side will be much more composed and dangerous in
front of goal when they return to the same stadium tonight because they
are likely to face similar problems.
''Yes, San Marino's big team will probably pack their defence in the
same way,'' Craig said, ''but I have to say that even though it was very
frustrating for us tonight I am delighted with the win and the way in
which my players stuck to their task.
''The did everything they were told, apart from the obvious thing
which you all saw for yourselves. They were a bit powder puff in front
of goal.
''It is ironic I think that while there are five strikers in this
squad the goal we needed was scored by a central defender.''
Although unwilling to use any harsh words while talking about the poor
finishing it was obvious early on that Stephen Crawford and Doug
Freedman were out of sorts, but there were other depressing aspects of
the Scottish performance. The deliveries were rarely good enough and
sometimes the ball was not released into the proper areas at the proper
time.
As a consequence, San Marino, who had one or two players who could
barely control the ball even when in space, were not under heavy
pressure in the first half. This under-21 campaign is San Marino's first
in serious competition and before last night's match they had conceded
17 goals in four outings.
Until Steven Pressley forced his way into their box late in the match
it seemed as though a combination of Scotland's woeful finishing and the
goalkeeping of Michele Ceccoli would save them from further losses.
However, the former Rangers player headed powerfully into the net from
close range in 71 minutes after San Marino failed to move the ball out
of their box and immediately Craig heaved a sigh of relief.
His side, who have played five games, are now on 12 points with the
Finns who have played a match fewer, but who have a far superior goal
difference. The Finns, who beat Craig's team at the start of the
competition, have still to play in Scotland and that match could be the
one on which everything will depend.
''This group will not be decided on goal difference,'' Craig said.
''It will be decided on points and we will win it on points.
''This squad has excelled in Athens and Moscow and they came here
tonight knowing they would face a different kind of task in that the
opposition would stay back in defence. They learned a hard lesson and
although they have harder tasks to come in matches against Greece and
Finland at home they will be tasks which will suit us better.''
He knows also that his players will have to be much sharper and
greedier when chances present themselves because the Greeks and Finns
are much more adept.
Pressley, who was booked for a rough challenge on Paolo Montagna after
only 18 minutes, never stopped urging his team on and performed like a
true captain. ''I felt before the match that I would score and so far as
I am concerned a 1-0 win is as good as a 6-0 one,'' he said.
''The most important thing was to get the points to keep us in touch
and in with a god chance of qualifying.''
Barnsley's Andy Liddell took over from Neil McCann at the interval and
Jim Hamilton, of Dundee, won his first cap when he relieved Freedman
seven minutes from time.

HOCKEY
HOCKEY like most sports, suffers at times from internal politics but
now an outside force, the United Nations, has created a major problem
for the Scottish men's under-21 side.
Through their sanctions, Yugoslavia have been forced to withdraw from
the European junior championship qualifying tournament which starts in
Genoa, Italy, on Saturday and so the event will now be played as a Six
Nations' competition.
Under the two-group system, Scotland -- having been drawn against
Gibraltar, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia -- looked to have an easy passage
to the semi-finals but now coach Derek Forsyth feels ''the change makes
it more difficult for us as it's going to become a dog-eat-dog
situation.''
Scotland's three other opponents England, Italy, and Portugal, will
definitely be more demanding and Forsyth is certainly not relishing
playing all three in the last three games with the third and final place
in the finals likely to be dependent on the outcome. The new order of
play is:
Saturday, April 29 -- England v Gibraltar, Italy v Portugal, Scotland
v Switzerland. Sunday, April 30 -- England v Portugal, Italy v
Switzerland, Scotland v Gibraltar. Tuesday, May 2 -- Switzerland v
Portugal, Italy v Gibraltar, England v Scotland. Wednesday, May 3 --
Gibraltar v Porgual, Italy v Scotland, England v Switzerland. Friday,
May 5 -- Switzerland v Gibraltar, Scotland v Portugal, Italy v England.

Bint Jbeil, Lebanon, Tuesday
A SUICIDE car bomb exploded near an Israeli military headquarters in
south Lebanon today, wounding nine Israeli soldiers.
The bomb blew up in Bint Jbeil, a large town in Israel's south Lebanon
occupation zone, near the headquarters of the Israeli Army's Western
Brigade, military sources said.
Israel has about 1000 soldiers in south Lebanon manning a nine-mile
border strip with the help of a 3000-man local client militia, the South
Lebanon Army (SLA).
The pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God), whose guerrillas attack the
Israelis and the SLA daily, issued a statement in Beirut claiming
responsibility. It said one of its militants died in the attack.
''This is a martyrdom operation in which a Hizbollah member died,''
said the Shi'ite Muslim group. ''It was carried out against an Israeli
headquarters during a rotation of troops.''
It was the bloodiest car bombing against the Israelis in Lebanon since
August 9, 1989, when a Hizbollah suicide bomber killed five Israeli
soldiers on patrol in the south.
Israel has held onto an occupation strip in south Lebanon since 1978,
in defiance of a UN Security Council resolution, in order to protect
itself from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
SLA sources said two Israeli jeeps were destroyed and nine soldiers
wounded in the blast, which gouged a crater 24ft wide and 6ft
deep.--Reuter.

DREW Docherty, the British bantamweight champion, has split from
trainer Pat Clinton, who steered him to ownership of a Lonsdale Belt in
his second successful title defence against Ady Benton in November.
The pair have been friends since boyhood, boxing out of the Croy club.
And when Clinton turned professional 10 years ago, Docherty took over
the mantle as Scotland's top amateur flyweight.
They sparred together while preparing for big pro fights and when
trainer Peter Harrison, who handled Docherty's preparations, left
manager Tommy Gilmour's camp last year, Clinton, who had then retired,
stepped in.
However, the old-pals act is over following Docherty's fourth-round
defeat when challenging Ghana's Alfred Kotey for the WBO bantam
championship at Cumbernauld in February.
''I've always looked up to Pat and am grateful for his help,'' said
Docherty. ''He played a huge part in me winning the Lonsdale Belt, for
he had me in great shape for the Benton fight, physically and mentally.
''My defeat against Kotey was, however, a big disappointment and I now
realise I need a full-time trainer, someone who will be able to work
with me when and where I want.
''Pat has a job outside boxing. He has a family to support and must do
what he thinks is right. But boxing is my full-time job and now that I
have a family to support I must do what is right for them.
Docherty's training is now being handled by Benny King, well respected
member of the Gilmour team, but he is keeping his options open.

PARTICK Thistle appear to be heading for a European shambles when the
draw for the Inter-Toto Cup is made in Geneva today.
UEFA officials have confirmed that the ballot will go ahead, although
not all the 60 places in the tournament have been filled. But Thistle's
dream of playing an English team such as Leeds, Tottenham, Wimbledon,
Queen's Park Rangers, or Southampton made be dashed.
Only Leeds are considering entering the event and will not give a
final decision until the end of the season.
A UEFA official said: ''It could be that Partick Thistle won't know
their opponents even after the draw. However, if a country has not
confirmed the team or teams representing them in the tournament, we will
still make the draw.''
To further complicate matters, UEFA intend to replace the actual name
of a team by a term such as ''Denmark 1'' which will denote the country
and ranking of the team in question.
Despite the confusion, Thistle secretary Robert Reid is still excited
about European football coming to Firhill for only the third time in the
club's history.
Qualification from the five-team group and victory in the second-round
games would enable Thistle to enter next season's UEFA Cup. ''We haven't
played in Europe since 1972,'' said Reid. ''Prior to that Thistle's only
other European matches came in the Fairs Cup of 1963.
Thistle will be in a Western European group, along with teams from
countries such as Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden.

BOWLS
RICHARD Corsie faces a difficult early test when he launches his bid
today to recapture the Mazda International Jack High title at the
Harbord Diggers' Club in Manly, Australia, when he lines up against one
of the top home hopes, Rex Johnston.
It is a clash of the Commonwealth gold medallists with Corsie having
picked up the singles' title and Johnston the pairs in Victoria last
August and it's one that the Scot knows is vital.
''My opening two matches are against Johnston and Cameron Curtis and I
really need to win at least one to keep alive any hopes of a semi-final
spot.
''With the top two in each section going through you can afford to
lose one match but if you lose two it would all be in the lap of the
Gods,'' said Corsie.
However, the Edinburgh man was happy with his final preparations
yesterday with the greens running slower than those on the Gold Coast
last week for the Mazda Tweed Classic.
''I reckon the greens here will be a good couple of seconds slower
than at Tweed Heads. That will help myself, the other two UK players
Andy Thomson and Ian McClure and Neil Burkett from South Africa.'' added
Corsie.
The top two in each section will battle out the semi-finals and final
on Sunday.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
THE United Nations said today that Britain had asked for soldiers from
another nation to replace its peacekeeping troops in the Serb-besieged
enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.
The news adds to the UN's current woes and underlines the
disenchantment of Western countries with their entanglement in the
Bosnian war.
''The British Government has asked for another nation to replace the
Royal Welch Fusiliers stationed there now,'' said UN spokesman Alexander
Ivanko.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed that Britain had requested
that its contingent be relieved when their tour of duty ends in
September.
''We will have done 18 months by then in very difficult conditions and
it is only right others share the burden,'' he said.
The news follows a request from the Dutch Government that its soldiers
be relieved from duty in another enclave, Srebrenica. French troops
pulled out of the north-western Bihac pocket last year and were replaced
by under-equipped Bangladeshis.
Around 350 Fusiliers are in Gorazde to protect its largely Muslim
population of 60,000 from Serb forces. British troops have been in the
enclave since a fierce Serb assault squeezed the pocket from all sides
in April 1994.
They have been reduced to patrolling parts of the region on foot
because the Bosnian Serbs have refused to allow in fuel deliveries for
the peacekeepers since the end of February.
The UN says the British commander in Gorazde has told them he will
have to cease all operations on May 9 unless fuel tankers are allowed
through.
''Its a very difficult place to live and work. It puts a lot of strain
on troops stationed there,'' the MoD spokesman said.
The lack of progress towards a settlement of the war in Bosnia has put
question marks over the future of the UN mission with Britain and France
warning they might pull out their troops.
The spokesman denied that the British request to the UN was part of a
withdrawal plan, but UN officials said it was an understandable
reflection of the frustration of some governments with their involvement
in Bosnia.
''Its a form of partial withdrawal from an area where their soldiers
are at risk for no clear purpose and with no end in sight,'' a UN
official said.

THE continuing doom and gloom in the property market south of the
Border disguises the fact that things are more cheerful in Scotland.
This is the view of estate agents Slater Hogg &amp; Howison in its first
quarterly report of the year.
Sales director Stuart Black says: ''The UK lenders' national reports
are simply not representative of the local Scottish markets. Slater
Hogg's report is based on actual sales in 33 branches across Scotland,
and we believe it reflects a much more accurate picture for the central
belt.
''Local market conditions require individual scrutiny and cannot be
fairly summarised by broad-brush averages. There is no such thing as a
UK, or a Scottish housing market. Instead there are only local markets,
collectively serving to provide an often imperfect overall picture.''
Individual reports from the firm's 33 branches reflect the
contradictions and similarities that exist throughout Scotland's central
belt. The busiest market sector is in the mid-range at prices between
#60,000 to #90,000, but a lack of choice is frustrating the second-time
mover and creating something of a bottleneck.
There has been a significant return in demand for solid, well-priced,
three-bedroom semis and detached villas in good condition, and not
enough of them are coming on to the market, mainly because people in
those properties don't have the confidence to trade up to properties
costing #90,000 or more.
Buyers are extremely price-sensitive. An accurate asking price is the
most vital starting point for a sale. If a property is even marginally
above the going rate it will not receive viewers or interest -
especially if the home was built in the last three to five years where
negative equity may be a consideration.
Meanwhile, a combination of aggressive sales techniques and incentives
is ensuring that new homes are continuing to sell at the expense of the
second-hand market. This is particularly apparent in places like
Bearsden, Stewartfield in East Kilbride, Dalgety Bay, and Cumbernauld.
Houses built in the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties now have to be in
tip-top condition and well priced in order to sell successfully.
The survey says that the choice for the first-time buyer has never
been better, although there is an increasing reluctance among the
20-to-30 age group to commit to home-ownership, many now preferring to
rent.
The top end of the market is still moving very slowly and has seen a
continued fall in prices. A lack of confidence is discouraging
investment in the luxury end of the market.
The good news is that some areas have performed against the trend.
Slater Hogg's Hamilton branch has reported brisk business and enjoyed
its best-ever start to a quarter reporting good sales across all levels,
particularly in the #60,000 to #90,000 bracket.
Other areas are claiming they don't have enough to sell, particularly
in the mid-market. Slater Hogg's Ayr, West End and City Centre,
Edinburgh, and Kilmarnock branches all reported a lack of choice for a
substantial number of credible buyers who are keen to make a move this
year but have been frustrated by the unavailability.
The estate agency has sold nearly 2000 properties worth #100m since
the start of 1995. The average selling price of a house handled by
Slater Hogg has fallen by 3% over the last 12 months. In the first
quarter of 1994 it was #57,981; now it is #56,232.
''The market conditions can bring some benefit. if you are selling for
less you are also buying for less. Unlike in the so-called boom times,
clients are getting value for money and with fewer closing dates, buying
is a far easier experience.
''Our figures show that with the proper advice and marketing many
clients have already sold successfully this year,'' says Stuart Black.
Meanwhile, Kirkcaldy is probably one of the few areas of the UK
experiencing a feel-good factor at the moment. The estate agency is
convinced that the Raith Rovers Coca Cola Cup win in November has had a
positive effect on the local population.
''Our Kirkcaldy branch has always ticked over, sometimes making its
target and sometimes not, but since November it has made every monthly
and quarterly target - something which has never happened before,'' says
Stuart Black.
His three other Fife branches have also seen improved sales figures. A
total of #14m worth of property was sold by Slater Hogg in Fife during
the first quarter of this year. ''Kirkcaldy is very proud of its
football team which has given the town something to talk about,'' says
Stuart Black.
Now Slater Hogg is offering a special 50% reduction in their fees for
Raith season ticket holders, available for the rest of this year.

ANDY Hicks reached the semi-final stage of the Embassy world
championship last night and was so impressive in beating Peter Ebdon,
that the beaten quarter-finalist claimed that: ''If Andy continues to
play like that he can win the tournament.''
Hicks, a left-hander, is only two wins away from becoming just the
second player to win the event on his Crucible Theatre debut. But the
manacing figure of reigning champion Stephen Hendry still casts a big
shadow over the event, for the Scot also reached the round of the last
four by beating Ronnie O'Sullivan 13-8.
Resuming 11-5 down overnight, Ebdon claimed three early frames and,
famed for his powers of recovery, the world No.10 sensed a comeback.
Instead, his hopes were finished by frame twenty-one as Hicks knocked in
his ninth break of the match in excess of 50.
''Andy beat me in every department,'' said Ebdon, who began the
quarter-finals as second favourite.
Hendry began his final day with a two-frame cushion that was suddenly
cut in half when O'Sullivan claimed the first frame of the day. However,
undeterred, the world No.1 showed his champion's quality by reeling off
the next three frames in just 48 minutes.
Along the way he knocked in breaks of 88 and 84 and a clearance of 133
to take the lead for a #16,000 high break prize. It was the 286th
century of his career and the forty-fourth in the world championship.
''Stephen is in a different class and I enjoy it every time we play,''
said O'Sullivan. ''He hardly missed a thing though yesterday I thought
he was there for the taking because he struggled a bit.''
Hicks' next opponent will be Nigel Bond, who reached the last four
with a 13-7 victory over Gary Wilkinson, while Jimmy White had a much
harder struggle to overcome John Parrott, White winning 13-11.

THE sun came out for a change in Glasgow yesterday. But such
conditions suited Derbyshire, and especially South African Daryll
Cullinan, more than Scotland.
So it was the county side who ran out winners by 46 runs in
yesterday's Benson and Hedges Cup contest at Titwood.
The Scots' performance -- they were well beaten at Worcester recently
-- was a big improvement from the weekend, but was not worthy of
comment, or so hired professional Malcolm Marshall appeared to think.
The former West Indian player was to busy to speak to reporters,
conversation with the local press seemingly not being part of his remit
while being paid by the Scottish Cricket Union.
While Marshall was willing to speak to television -- a branch of the
media which gives scant coverage to Scottish cricket except when a
''superstar'' appears -- what words of wisdom he had, if any, for the
written press remained a secret.
''We can't tell him what to do or not to do off the field,'' said
chief selector Hugh Stevenson. ''We're paying him to play cricket, not
talk about it.'' Marshall had not a bad day cricket wise, but still he
could not inspire the Scots to a shock outcome.
Tight bowling from the Scots kept Derbyshire in check until late in
the day, when Cullinan cut loose. Peter Steindl had raised hopes,
nipping out Adrian Rollins and Chris Adams, both finding the gloves of
David Haggo. However, Cullinan joined in a stand of 42 with Kim Barnett,
and then put on 72 with Tim O'Gorman to push his side towards a
reasonable tally.
And that became an unbeatable one when Cullinan -- the youngest player
to score a first-class ton in South Africa -- decided to smash it
around, crashing 23 off the last two overs to take him to three figures
in 110 balls, clocking up 10 boundries.
Replying, Scotland lost three wickets by the time they had reached 38.
Steve Crawley stuck around and took a liking to the visitors seam
attack. He was fourth out on 59, but not before he had stroked 34 runs,
five 4's in that neat knock.
Scotland were in with an outside chance when skipper Jim Love and
Marshall were in tandem. The Yorkshire/Barbados combine added 54 in 41
minutes for the fifth wicket, until Love -- who had lofted Barnett for
six -- was trapped in front by Phil DeFreitas.
When Marshall holed out at third man off Devon Malcolm for a top score
of 36, it signalled the beginning of the end. Ian Stanger hit a brisk
27, but gained little support from his fellow tail-enders

ONE of the oldest trade associations in the automobile industry, the
Vehicle Builders and Repairers Association has notched up another year
of success.
Having celebrated its 80th birthday in 1994, the VBRA took stock of a
rapidly changing industry and launched a five-year plan designed to take
it into the next century on an even stronger platform.
This was quite a feat. The VBRA is already recognised as a flexible
and responsive association able to adapt quickly to a rapidly changing
industry, its principal strength lying in the fact that it is run by
individuals who actually work within the industry they represent.
But at the same time there was an underlying feeling that it was a
reactive rather than proactive organisation, hence the development of
the new plan.
In essence this was presented as a statement to the membership
promising a new drive to ''offer a professional, quality service and
support to members, helping to develop their efficiency and
profitability and to obtain better prices''.
There was also a commitment to become a proactive, regulatory,
forward-thinking customer-orientated association, its objectives
including a drive to ensure that membership of the VBRA is recognised as
the sign of the professional crash repairer.
Membership criteria would be developed. So would profitability and
links with key industry players while internal and external
communications would be improved.
Acknowledging that there had been times in the past when the
association may have seemed unclear as to whom it should direct its
lobbying and promotional efforts, it took steps for the first time to
define its target markets in order of priority.
Naturally insurance companies figure on the list, as do fleet
managers, the public, accident management companies, Government and the
industry's suppliers. Having launched these plans at the 1994 Harrogate
conference, the second half of the year was devoted to putting the new
strategy into place.
''This produced a tremendous surge of activity,'' said national
chairman, Andrew Couper. ''The insurance companies were wooed and
cajoled in a series of meetings and presentations designed to make them
more aware of the needs and demands of the body repair industry.''
He pointed out that meetings were held with five of the top six
insurers at chief engineer level as well as a whole series of
discussions between the VBRA and the smaller insurance companies.
In addition the Office of Fair Trading was made aware of the problems
some members were experiencing with ''approved repairer'' schemes, a
theme also explored during discussions with the Association of British
Insurers.
The vital service provided by suppliers was also recognised with the
agreement to investigate the creation of a suppliers' members' council
to run in conjunction with the national repairers' and national
manufacturers' councils.
To assist bodyshops to become even more efficient, the association
launched its own bodyshop management training programme with modulous
management consultancy.
This initiative helps bodyshop managers to analyse their strengths and
weaknesses, identifying where improvements can be made and offering help
and guidance towards this end.
Mr Couper said also that the business of attracting a higher quality
of management staff had also come under scrutiny, with the VBRA joining
forces with one of the leading UK automotive human resources agencies,
John Gibson Associates, to institute a new recruitment service to
bodyshops.
The association took a decision around six years ago to set a high
standard of premises and staff training. This was principally to
reassure insurance companies and their policy holders.
These standards have now been achieved, but they are constantly being
improved upon, computerised estimating being an important factor.
The premises of VBRA members are also subject to regular exterior
examination, by AA inspectors, who may recommend changes, including the
purchasing of new equipment. Meeting these requirements can be costly --
as is the whole inspection process -- but the association, having opened
its doors to outside scrutiny, is always anxious to act on these
recommendations.
Given the willingness of members to improve their own efficiency, a
quality development programme capable of taking member companies through
to BS EN ISO 9002 certification was put together -- and at much less
cost than conventional schemes. This three-stage self-assessment
programme was developed in conjunction with the Automobile Association.
''With more than 200 VBRA members in Scotland and a permanent waiting
list of others either waiting for approval or working towards achieving
the entry standards we demand, the association has already achieved a
great deal,'' said Mr Couper.
''It is also an ongoing process. There simply will never be a time
when we can relax and claim to have done all there is to be done. Not in
an industry as challenging as this one.''

VEHICLE body repair, to the motorist, represents the ultimate in
distress purchases.
Nobody wants to be involved in an accident, or to return to find that
a car which was in pristine condition when parked is now looking
distinctly second-hand thanks to someone else's carelessness.
So by definition the professional repairer has to possess many more
skills than those employed in the workshop.
There has to be a dialogue with the insurer, but ultimately it is the
owner or driver of the stricken vehicle who passes the final judgment on
whether the repair has been carried out satisfactorily.
''We often have to deal with people we have never met before and who
will probably never wish to see us again,'' said Andrew Couper, VBRA
national chairman. ''They all have one thing in common: they have
invested a great deal of money in their vehicles and are anxious that
they should be repaired to a high standard in order that this investment
is protected.
''This is why VBRA members are constantly seeking out ways and means
of improving their workshop procedures and investing heavily in new
equipment.
''Naturally there has to be a financial return. It can cost anything
upwards of #20,000 just to install a modern paint booth, which is why we
are now trying to persuade insurance companies that a uniform estimating
procedure should be adopted.
''At the moment different parties are estimating from different sets
of criteria, which can lead to a certain amount of confusion as they are
not exactly compatable, so some dialogue is currently taking place as to
how a solution can be worked out.
''Even so, the standard of work our members produce and the materials
they use can very often mean that a car leaving the workshop is actually
in much better condition than before it was damaged.''
''With the majority of our members only employing around a dozen or so
people on average, we have occasionally been likened to a cottage
industry,'' said Mr Couper.
''But with regular meetings, shared information and a willingness to
constantly improve and refine everything we do, we are collectively very
much more efficient than we would be if we stood apart from one
another.''

TWO youngsters in particular will be in the spotlight tomorrow as the
conference moves into top gear. Fourteen-year-old Kirsteen Blackwood
from Dumbarton Academy and 13-year-old Louise Ferguson from Bellarmine
Secondary, Glasgow, are to be top-table spectators as the keynote
speeches are made.
The reason: it is ''Take Our Daughters To Work'' day. And Kirsteen
will have a special interest in the proceedings as her father will be
introducing them.
Alex Blackwood is manager of the Glasgow Education Business
Partnership and chair of the conference organising committee. He reckons
Kirsteen is going to hear some interesting views on what the future
should hold for people of her generation.
Every local enterprise area has an education business partnership and
there have certainly been plenty of good things emanating from them. The
Glasgow one has a variety of private concerns as members as well as the
Glasgow Development Agency, Strathclyde Regional Council, and various
further education colleges.
''We decided this conference would put the focus on the role of
partnership in economic development,'' says Blackwood. ''There are many
good things happening already but perhaps more could be done to
demonstrate to industry that there is something in this for them.
''Businesses who support education are helping to improve the
workforce of the future, thus enabling industry to take advantage of the
economic upturn when it comes.
''New attitudes to business are going to be needed, and young people
need to know the value of adaptability, timekeeping, attendance, and
team working.
''They also need to appreciate that academic achievements, or even
lack of them, are not going to be of absolute importance either way in
the workplace of the future. Industry will want young people who can
adapt and change.
''A company can employ a young person who has all the qualifications
for a particular job. But should that job radically change in nature
five years later, and the employee does not have the necessary
flexibility, then the company has a problem.''
David Dimmock, education liaison manager with Standard Life Assurance
Company, chairman of Lothian EBP and a fellow member of the organising
committee, agrees that attitudes must change and makes the point that
companies require to reach out to the education world to share
experience and ideas.
Standard Life, which is sponsoring the final day of the conference
(earlier sponsors are McDonalds Restaurants, Marks and Spencer, and BT),
already sends staff on secondment to a variety of schools, colleges and
universities.
''It all boils down to raising skill levels, and helping tomorrow's
workforce to appreciate what industry is all about,'' he says.
And one of the first-day keynote speakers, The Hon. David Sieff,
director of corporate and external affairs at Marks and Spencer, will
take up the theme.
Meanwhile, he told me this week that education was a major part of
Marks' community programme.
''In today's world, it is more important than ever for parents,
educators, and employers to be partners,'' he said.
''Young people need to be prepared and motivated, not just for their
first job, but to go on learning throughout life. Partnerships must be
the common theme running though all of our involvement.''

IF they could bottle the air of optimism and buoyancy which now exists
it would create a whole new industry for Blackburn, as JOHN LINKLATER
found out on a visit to the Lancashire home of the Rovers and Lottery
winners.
FIRST there is Gary, a shaven-head guy in his twenties who has been
supporting the team all his life. He was in Ireland this year and he
said he was from Blackburn. Where? That meant nothing. Blackburn, he
tried again, where Blackburn Rovers play. There was immediate
recognition. ''Oh, Blackburn.''
''The Rovers have put Blackburn back on the map,'' says Gary, but the
outside world still is struggling with the notion it is a real town,
with real streets to dance in when they win the English Premiership.
More when, than if, after Thursday night's win which puts Rovers eight
points clear of Manchester United, who must win all of their last four
games.
Second, there was the call to directory inquiries I made before
leaving Glasgow. I asked for a number for Blackburn Rovers Football
Club. ''Which town is that?'' asked the operator. It's in Blackburn,
actually. ''Is that Blackburn, Lancashire, or Blackburn, West Lothian?''
Even when you're on top, you can't win, apparently. Blackburnians are
a stoical people, descended from generations of lives surrendered to
hardship and drudgery in what was once the world's largest weaving town,
where 10-year-olds were dragged from the classrooms of a century ago and
set to the loom treadles.
As much as Glaswegians, they have suffered from contemptuous
stereotypes that are deeply resented. If Glasgow was about drunks, razor
gangs, and incomprehensible accents, the same cliche sneer department
had Blackburn down under flat caps, clogs, cobbled streets, whippets,
and Hovis adverts. Success is going to change that image.
It has been coming in all directions. The town suddenly got lucky, and
this was more than a case of scrap-iron-to-riches millionaire Jack
Walker opening his cheque book to bankroll his beloved Rovers.
It is an extraordinary fact that since the Lottery began, there have
been five major winners in Blackburn, in a statistics-defying succession
since the first #17m winner. Now there are folk coming up from
Manchester, 20 miles to the south, to buy their tickets in Blackburn.
They have made a shrine of the local Tesco, which has blessed previous
jackpots.
If they could bottle the air of optimism and buoyancy it would create
a new industry for Blackburn, but regeneration is building from a more
solid foundation. Since the Blackburn Partnership was formed in 1988 as
a pooling of private and public resources to promote social and economic
regrowth, there has been a ready structure to attract funding.
Blackburn, the second smallest borough to apply, but the thirteenth
most deprived out of 200, won #37m in a five-year City Challenge
initiative from the Government. Then its Single Regeneration partnership
bid won another #19.5m over seven years.
''We are small, but we like to think we punch above our weight,'' says
Phil Watson, deputy chief executive of Blackburn Borough. The borough
population, absorbing neighbouring Darwen's 30,000, is still only
140,000. The compactness of the town, pressed and wedged into the
Blakewater Valley like a pre-war crowd on the terraces at Ewood, means
that projects of environmental improvement, housing refurbishment,
revitalisation of eyesores, and blighted housing schemes, make an
immediate impact. Blackburn likes to think it can demonstrate value for
investment.
It is estimated to be attracting a further #113m in private and
European funding, through the additional formulae and because, in blunt
terms, success breeds success.
This is where identification with Blackburn Rovers is proving an
invaluable asset. ''We just couldn't buy the publicity the football club
has brought to Blackburn,'' says Watson, a lifelong fan who echoes the
general incredulity that the impossible appears to be happening, that
Rovers are on the verge of a championship they last won in 1914. He
declines to say any more for fear of putting ''pressure on the club.''
The caution is understandable. The sheer gallusness that a
championship would inject into the temperament of the community is the
quality the civic administrators and business community feel would
cement the groundwork they have laid in achieving big funding.
''The result of a Blackburn football match on a Saturday affects the
mindset,'' says Paul Rink, joint chairman of Wolstenholme Rink plc, with
its headquarters in the town controlling an operation extending through
Britain, Europe, and the US, in manufacturing specialist products for
printing.
''A winning side has a positive effect on productivity. In a culture
where we play negative off scratch, it creates an environment where
people see what they can do, rather than what they can't. You don't have
to measure it to recognise the impact.''
''We might have won our own successes without the football team,''
says Peter Robinson, chief executive of Blackburn Partnership. ''But
Rovers make it easier for us to market and promote ourselves.''
Representatives of the club joined the Partnership, regarded as a
pioneering model in Britain, when it made a presentation at the House of
Commons last week. It featured a large poster of Alan Shearer,
Blackburn's phenomenal striker.
Shearer is part of a new breed of player brought to Rovers through
#29.6m that ''senior vice-president'' Walker (the coy title he has
accepted at the club -- it means ''owner'') has released for manager
Kenny Dalglish to spend on the transfer market. Shearer's #3.3m price
tag from Southampton a couple of seasons ago now looks like one of the
soundest investments in football history, with a speculated Italian bid
likely to land Blackburn more than #8m.
There is a touch of fantasy about Blackburn just now, like a computer
game becoming too easy. The Rovers fanzine brazenly entitles itself
Loadsamoney. The club is regularly accused of ''buying'' the title.
This may be true, but no more true of any other club, though clubs
like Manchester United and Liverpool have accumulated their pools over
longer periods than the three years of intensive Blackburn transfer
activity.
There is an implication of the upstart in the criticisms levelled at
them, as though they lack the class and pedigree to aspire to the upper
classes of English football. In fact, Blackburn, one of the founder
members of the league, were buying success over a century ago. Their
successive FA Cup wins of 1884, 1885, and 1886 (a triple that stands as
a record) were achieved with an influx of ''upholsterer'' Hugh McIntyre,
''pattern maker'' Jimmy Douglas, and ''stone mason'' Gergie Sutar, all
brought from Scotland as back-door professionals.
Sutar, who had not been seen practising his trade in Lancashire, gave
the show away somewhat when he claimed that he could not work English
stone, and had been forced to seek his livelihood by other means.
Blackburn's Scottish connection continued through later eras. They set
a British transfer record of #1800 in 1911 for Jock Simpson from
Falkirk. The first five-figure fee in Britain was the #10,000 Blackburn
paid for Jock Weir from Hibernian in 1947, before selling him to Celtic
a year later. And, of course, Ally MacLeod, later to become Scotland
team manager, played for them, too.
That tradition continues in the present team with Colin Hendry, the
Scottish internationalist defender who is tipped to win the Rovers
supporters' player of the year award.
The ''mercenaries'' charge amuses Bryan Douglas, one of Blackburn's
two most revered post-war players, a one-club man with 502 appearances
over 15 seasons who was born 400 yards from Ewood Park in Oakfield Road,
who still lives in the borough.
He played in the losing Blackburn side in the FA Cup at Wembley
against Wolves in 1960 and he was in the 1963-64 team that led the old
first division before blowing up and finishing seventh.
It was at international level that he won honours, with 36 caps for
England, a thorn in Scotland's side in three wins out of five with three
goals to his credit. Even with such a distinguished career he wants
Blackburn to win the title this time because it will relieve him of some
guilt.
''Being a Blackburnian, I was closer to the people in the town,'' he
says of the 1960 and '63 near-things. ''I felt we let the town down. We
were always up against the bigger city teams, but with a little more
professionalism we could have achieved it. For someone like me, winning
the championship now would bring back a bit of pride that was lost.''
We are in one of the executive boxes at the magnificent new #20m Ewood
Stadium that has been built from Jack Walker's benefactions over the
past three years. There is a smell of new carpets and wood, and a
tie-only rule is in force. The crowd in the Jack Walker Stand have
watched with relief as Blackburn held on to a 2-1 win over Crystal
Palace on Thursday night.
They are a fickle support, exhibiting little fanaticism, almost like a
cinema audience waiting for the action bits, and when things go wrong
they grumble like Lancashire tourists unhappy with fancy foreign food.
There are some here because they smell success, yet tickets remained on
sale until before kick-off for the 30,000-capacity ground.
Joyce Douglas, another Blackburnian, laughs as Brian confesses to
nearly suffering a heart-attack in the last 10 minutes of the game as
the tension mounted. ''He was watching them when they slipped down to
the third division, along with our sons Stephen and Graham,'' she says.
''For the fans who have supported them through those times, they deserve
it. Of course, they deserve it, even if they can't believe it yet.''

A simple, inexpensive way to reduce the heat loss from your house is
to draughtproof the windows and doors. If cold air is forcing its way
into the house through rotted or badly fitting window frames or through
cracks around windows and doors, then there is no doubt that you are
spending a lot more cash than is necessary to heat your home.
Heating bills can be reduced by as much as 60p in the pound by
installing draughtproofing and insulation, but how much you actually
save depends on the cost of the work compared to the saving in fuel.
Insulating the loft and eliminating draughts from windows and doors are
the most cost effective measures you can take, and installing double
glazing will also save some fuel, dramatically reduce noise and will
increase comfort near windows.
Specialist double glazing companies will ensure that your replacement
windows provide high levels of insulation while maintaining ventilation
at a safe and comfortable level. Draughts can occur when air is sucked
into the house from outside to replace air used by boilers and fires. If
you block the gaps where air is coming in, you will stop the draught.
Although the house will be more comfortable if you prevent streams of
cold air moving through it, you must have controlled ventilation to keep
the air fresh and remove excessive moisture.
Fires and boilers need air to burn efficiently and safely. Vents
should be as close as possible to the appliance so that air passing to
it does not cause a draught, and ventilators should never be blocked
off, or fumes may be sucked down a chimney, with possibly lethal
results. If the air has to pass across a room, the vents should be
fitted above a door or high in a wall so that air entering from outside
is mixed with the warmed air in the room before it moves to the fire or
boiler. Never block out the draught designed to pass under the house --
dry rot can develop if the timber is not well ventilated. You can keep
the cold air out by draughtproofing the floor from the inside.
A reputable replacement door and window firm will provide factory-made
double glazed units to ensure that you have a warmer, quieter, cleaner
and more fuel-efficient home, which has sufficient ventilation to
protect the fabric of the building and prevent condensation. Replacing
old windows with modern, high technology double glazing is also a cost
effective way to enhance the value of your home and increase security.
Installing double glazing is recognised as a major home improvement
and most banks and building societies will provide loans to meet some or
all of the cost. Modern replacement windows and doors usually come with
built-in locks which have improved dramatically in recent years, and
patio doors -- once particularly vulnerable because they could be lifted
out of the frame by burglars -- are now protected by special devices
which go in the gap between the door panel and frame to prevent it being
lifted out.
Insurance companies point out that in around 60% of cases, burglars
break in through windows at the back of the home, and that in three out
of 10 cases, the window was left conveniently open. If you opt for new
double glazed replacement windows and doors, make sure that the firm you
choose to carry out the installation is security conscious, and check
that ventilation systems are adequate, so that leaving a window open
when you are not at home is quite unnecessary.
There are many excellent double glazing companies, but consumers have
encountered problems with some firms, so take care to choose an
established, reputable firm. There have been cases where homeowners have
had windows installed which did not meet local building regulations, and
worthless guarantees have meant that another bill has had to be paid for
a new set of replacement windows which did comply with planning
requirements.
There are schemes backed by major insurance companies which provide
protection to customers of double glazing firms, and some contractors
are members of one of these schemes which protect deposits, back
guarantees and will even meet the cost of remedial work in the event of
a defect occurring, even if the contractor has gone out of business.
Most double glazing contractors ask for a deposit -- this is normal
practice in the business, and the Office of Fair Trading suggest that
the deposit should not exceed 20% of the cost of the installation, and
should be protected in case the contractor ceases trading before the job
is finished. Some firms expect payment on completion of the installation
work, but it is in your interests to have at least seven days to check
that the new windows are properly installed and effective, and if you
want to have this time, you should make an agreement to this effect with
the contractor at the outset.
Correct design, appropriate materials and professional installation
are essential -- even the best quality windows will perform poorly if
the installation is shoddy. Reputable firms will provide a detailed
quotation, describing the windows, doors and locks and listing exactly
what your are getting for your money, and will be able to assure you of
a high quality installation. The type of frames and locks should be
specified, and be sure you know that the type of frame to be used
satisfies planning requirements, and whether internal sills are included
in the quotation.
Clydesdale Double Glazing is one of a handful of companies in the UK
which has been awarded the quality assurance benchmark ISO 9001 for
design of windows and conservatories, as well as for the manufacture and
installation of replacement windows and doors. Run by two brothers whose
family have been manufacturing windows in Wishaw for nearly 70 years,
Clydesdale operates from Unit 18, Netherton Industrial Estate, and has
one of the largest replacement window and door showrooms in Scotland,
featuring some richly coloured stained glass designs and a tremendous
range of PVCu windows in white and woodgrain effects.

Technology has changed so many aspects of modern life and work that
the real challenge is now involved in educating our youngsters in how to
cope. Eric Kennedy reports on a three-day conference whose aim is to
bring education and industry closer.
LIFE skills are now as important as academic skills when it comes to
identifying the ideal employee. What is the point, for example, in
educating someone in a specific job when that task is likely to have
changed beyond all recognition in five or six years' time? This is only
one issue being addressed at a highly significant conference which has
drawn more than 400 speakers and delegates from all over Europe and
North America to the Glasgow Hilton this week.
It is to focus on the partnerships already forged between education
and industry, and on how to make them better.
Economic Development: The Role of Education and Business in
Partnership gets under way in earnest tomorrow and will be no ordinary
event.
Live link-ups with North America and news of a revolutionary
entrepreneurial scheme for inner-city students -- which is to be tried
out in Scotland -- are only two of the highlights.
The conference, lasting three full days after today's registration and
welcoming ceremony for foreign delegates, will enable educationists and
businessmen from different parts of the world to share their experiences
in shaping the workforces of the future, ensuring that attitudes to
change are exactly right, and that flexibility of both employers and
employees is at a maximum.
Participants will include national and local decision makers,
teachers, careers advisers, economic development agencies, and policy
managers. Key speakers will include The Hon. David Sieff, Director of
Corporate and External Affairs at Marks and Spencer, Strathclyde
Education Director Frank Pignatelli, Scottish Enterprise Chief Executive
Crawford Beveridge, BT's Scottish manager Bill Furness, IBM (UK)
Director Professor John Ward, Allan Stewart MP, and Steve Mariotti,
President of America's National Foundation for Teaching
Entrepreneurship.
The last-named will be talking about a revolutionary self-help scheme
for deprived youngsters, which started in New York in 1987 and is to be
given a Scottish try-out in partnership with Scottish Enterprise
National.
The latter is among the sponsors of the conference -- others include
The Herald -- and its business development director, Russell Griggs,
feels it is appropriate that the event should be taking place during the
Year of the Entrepreneur.
''It is vital,'' he says, ''that young people should know how the
world of business works. It is also important that business and industry
should know how the world of education works. If this does not happen
you are going to get a mismatch around the expectations of both parties.
''I know of one teacher in Lothian Region who was sent on work
placement to a well-known company for five days, and who had transformed
its visitor tours before she left, making them much more educational and
consumer-orientated.
''The CBI in Scotland, in its Manufacturing Matters booklet earlier
this year, declared that teacher placement in business was fundamental
to the further development of the Scottish economy.
''There has been a sea change in the world of work, and economic
growth is now led by small and medium-sized companies as opposed to
conglomerates. For young people leaving school nowadays, the chance of a
career for life is remote, never mind a job for life.
''The whole perspective of work is changing, with the accent on
adaptability and attitude. Education and industry must address this fact
or our economy will not move forward.''
The conference is also to look at regeneration in rural as well as
urban communities, strategies for increasing the business birthrate,
sowing the seeds of entrepreneurship, linking the curriculum to personal
and vocational skills development, defining skills for a changing
workplace, and the changing role of partnership.
It will consist of a series of workshops, issue sessions, debates both
formal and informal, and ''Steal and Share'' sessions where presenters
will offer short presentations in round-table discussions with other
delegates, who are free to move from one session to the other, thus
maximising the pooling of good ideas.
On Friday, delegates will also have a chance to see Education Business
Partnerships (EBPs) in action through visiting projects in different
areas of Scotland. They will have a choice among Argyll and the Islands,
Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway, Dunbartonshire, Forth Valley, Glasgow,
Lanarkshire, Lothian, Renfrewshire, and Tayside, with coaches leaving
the Hilton at 8am and returning at 2pm or earlier.
It is not, therefore, to be a mere talking shop -- although with
delegates from different parts of the US, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, Hungary, Norway, Spain, Finland, and Sweden, there is sure to
be a great deal to discuss in what is a continually changing world.

PRIZE money at this year's Wimbledon Championships has soared to
#6,025,550 -- with the men's champion receiving #365,000 and the women's
#328,000.
''People might think that this is an awful lot of money,'' said club
chairman John Curry, ''but in my opinion the players are worth every
penny.
''Think of how much top businessmen are paid and how much pop stars
receive. At Wimbledon the players are the best in the world and they
deserve the best from us.''
The official added that the level of prize money at this year's event,
which runs from June 26 to July 9, had been influenced by a range of
factors. He said that Wimbledon kept an eye on what the other Grand Slam
tournaments paid and added: ''It's what you can afford to pay.
''The most important factor is to ensure that Wimbledon's premier
position in the international tennis scene is maintained by continuing
to offer the best facilities for players, spectators, and the media.''
There will be a 6% increase in the prize money from last year. That is
double the rate of inflation, and even first-round losers will hardly
walk away empty-handed.
Losers at that stage of the men's singles will receive #5475 and in
the women's singles #4250. The runner-up in the men's singles will
collect #182,500 and in the women's #164,000.
Curry revealed that the All-England Club's long-term development plans
for Wimbledon were up to schedule.
A new No.1 Court is being built, which will be in use in 1997, along
with two new outside courts, 18 and 19, for use the following year.
A new television centre and underground link road between Church and
Somerset Roads also is being built.
The total breakdown of prize money at the championships is (with last
year's figures in brackets):

* ANDREI Medvedev, the holder and suffering from dizzy spells,
stumbled out of the Monte Carlo Open at the first hurdle yesterday.
The 20-year-old, who had to receive medical attention because of high
blood pressure, was beaten 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 by Australian Richard Fromberg
in a rain-interrupted match.
''I felt so dizzy I almost fell in the first set,'' said Medvedev. ''I
was lucky the rain came. The doctor helped a lot but it was too late.''
There was another shock when an off-form Stefan Edberg lost to
Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 6-1.
* MICHELE Mair, the Scottish No.1, will find her path barred by
another Russian when she plays Natasha Egorova in the LTA International
Spring Satellite tournament in Edinburgh today.
Mair met two of Egorova's compatriots in last week's Reebok event,
losing to eventual winner Julia Lutrova. But Mair had few problems
yesterday in beating Elena Salvador (Spain) 6-1, 6-4 in the first round
yesterday while Egorova defeated Amelie Mauresmo of France 6-2, 6-3.
Results:
Men (qualifying round) -- B Curry (SA) beat J Draper (GB) 6-3,6-3; D
Ward (GB) beat K Herke (GB) 6-3, 6-0; T Hand (GB)) be at O Hadden
(Scone); A Osterreith (GB) beat W Sawyer (GB) 6-2, 2-6, 7-6; M Ingham
(GB) beat L Sabin (GB) 7-5, 7-5; D Saunders (GB) beat B O'Connor (GB)
6-2, 6-1; M Boulding (GB) beat J Barnett (Stirling Uni) 1-6, 6-2, 6-2; G
Darlington (Bridge of Allan) beat G Hobbs (GB) 7-6,7-5.
Women (first round) -- D Chaldkova (Czech) beat K Sharpe (Aus) 6-4,
6-3; Z Mellis beat N Schwarz (Austria) 7-5, 7-6; N Egorova (Rus) beat A
Mauresmo (Fra) 6-2, 6-3; M Mair (Colinton) beat E Salvador (Spain) 6-1,

Ross Finlay finds a company brushing up on their act
JUST about the first time I remember seeing one of the products of the
Polish car factory whose complicated name is usually shortened to FSO,
it was in the process of smacking into a bridge. That was in the early
1960s, in the countryside near Krakow, and the driver was so intent on
watching the -- to him --unfamiliar British car I was in, that he took
his eyes for far too long off the road.
In those days FSO produced a car called, after the national capital,
the Warszawa. It was a Polish-assembled Russian Pobieda, which I seem to
remember had overtones of the American Willys and the British Standard
Vanguard. Later, FSO took on the redundant Fiat 125 and assembled it as
the Polski-Fiat. There was also a Polski-Fiat 126, and more recently the
bigger car was rebodied as the Polonez.
After being away from the UK market for a while, FSO reappeared in
1993, marketed by a new company, based at Stafford, under British, Dutch
and Polish ownership. The Dutch element is a very lively organisation
called Abimex, part of a group which sells such diverse products as FSO,
Hyundai and Harley-Davidson in Holland, and once invited David Coulthard
over to help it launch a Marcos race series.
At the factory end, FSO is involved in significant joint ventures with
General Motors, and recently started assembly of the Astra at a rate
planned to be about 10,000 cars annually, with the possibility of
trebling that figure in the years ahead.
The importance of the GM link, as far as the FSO cars which are on
sale here are concerned, is that it provides some modernisation of a
model line whose mechanical design goes back a very long way. The FSO
five-door Caro hatchback at #5999, for instance, has Astra fuel
injection and engine management grafted onto the old Fiat-based
1.5-litre unit, to perk up its performance.
But FSO spreads its supplier net quite wide. The Caro diesel at #6999
has the benefit of the latest 1.9-litre Citroen engine. So an admittedly
outdated general design uses one of the best diesel power units in
Europe, at the lowest price in its class.
FSO is rather good at finding niche markets. There is a
taxi-specification Caro, and the commercial model line-up features a
one-ton pick-up whose prices start at #6299 plus VAT. For #200 more
there is the option of a lightweight aluminium body, while a
special-order tipper version comes at #7499. The latest examples have
stronger front suspension, a better warranty and an immobiliser as
standard.
Power steering, revised braking systems and a completely new fascia
will be fed in to the whole FSO model range within the next year. A
four-door Caro saloon is expected in the UK about 18 months from now,
with an estate car to follow.
An extended-cab long wheelbase pick-up is already in production in
Poland, and is expected to be made in right-hand drive form later. Using
Subaru four-wheel drive, a 4WD pick-up is also being built in Poland,
but there is no firm word yet about any RHD programme.
On the private car front, the most important news is that, although
the 1.4-litre Rover K-series engine is fitted to the Caro for some
left-hand drive markets, the hatchback range will be extended next year
to include a model with the latest 1.6-litre K-series unit. Those of us
who have already sampled this engine, which is not yet available even in
a Rover, know that it is a real stormer.
If you take the prices of the present limited-model range into
consideration, and look at what FSO plans over the next year and a half,
you cannot avoid thinking that a make which currently has a pretty low
profile here is soon going to be more of a budget-level force to be
reckoned with.

SCOTTISH internationalist Mary McClung recorded the fastest time of
the season by a Scot when winning an inter-university 800 metres race in
Alabama. The Kilmarnock middle-distance runner, competing for the
University of Georgia in her final year of athletic eligibility,
recorded a personal best time of 2min 05.64sec to win from Canadian
internationalist Vicky Lynch and will return to Scotland to defend her
national 800 metres title later in the summer.

EDUCATING our children for yet another industrial age is not a new
concept in Strathclyde Region.
It is, as Education Director Frank Pignatelli recently outlined in a
paper for the CBI, an integral part of the curricular, cross-curricular,
and extra-curricular educational experience of pupils as they have
progressed through their schooldays. Schools are committed to the
promotion of links between education and industry in order to develop
understanding, skills and attitudes that will help youngsters prepare
for adult life and the world of work.
Industry Awareness Days and enterprise schemes are only part of the
scene in Scotland's biggest and most influential region. So Mr
Pignatelli will have much to contribute as he gives his keynote address
to the conference tomorrow morning.
He tells me he regards entrepreneurship and enterprise as part of the
mainline curriculum in Strathclyde's 170 secondary schools, but that he
is wary of ''bolt-on'' projects with limited life spans and small
targets.
''Built-in'' education is more in favour, with schools adopting an
integrated approach to pupil development. Departments such as English,
drama, and office and information systems can complement each other's
work in encouraging young entrepreneurs.
The bonus is that a pupil involved in a Young Enterprise scheme might
come to an English class in a more receptive frame of mind if he or she
has spent the previous half-hour negotiating for a contract.
Or it could be the other way around: the skills learned in his English
class might have equipped him all the better to articulate his argument
for the contract.
A drama department might impart skills needed for job interviews, and
schools in Strathclyde are judged these days not only on academic
achievement but on how well they prepare their pupils for the world of
work.
Strathclyde was the first mainland authority in Scotland to establish
an Education Business Partnership and there are now six of them in the
region.
Ninety of its secondaries -- including 12 schools for pupils with
special needs -- are participating in Young Enterprise schemes and the
region is very involved in Scotvec modules on enterprise activity.
Schools also have a course in social and vocational skills which
contains a life skills element which involves running a mini-company.
Strathclyde Region Education Department is committed to delivering a
service which fully supports economic growth and prosperity. That
includes providing an awareness of, and introduction to working life,
organising visits to and from industry and commerce, and arranging
formal meetings with local enterprise companies.
Pupils are made aware of the work people do, are taken to see the
places where people earn their living, and given suitable
work-experience placements. Issues relating to working life are included
in the curriculum, and some emphasis is placed on conservation and on
saving energy.
''Enterprise education is not a new set of activities which in
themselves would have the same character as a traditional subject,''
says Mr Pignatelli.
Children in Strathclyde are encouraged to develop independent thought
through inquiry, problem solving, information handling, and reasoning.
They are also taught to make creative and practical use of a variety of
media to express feelings and ideas, and to acquire knowledge, skills
and understanding in literacy and communication, numeracy, and
mathematical thinking.
Work experience and work shadowing schemes, industry conferences,
curriculum projects relating to local industry, design-and-make
activities, work simulations, and Young Enterprise schemes all help.
''Our schools are already accepting the challenge of helping their
students develop social, interpersonal and business skills and I am
looking forward to sharing ideas at the conference,'' says Mr
Pignatelli.

ICE cream has stolen my heart. Not just any ice cream, but Ben and
Jerry's, the famous Vermont purveyors of heaven on earth.
Imagine then my feelings when told that Ben and Jerry were coming to
Scotland and not empty handed -- the ice cream was coming too.
Never have I looked forward more to a press conference and I must
confess right now that the following can in no way be considered
unbiased or objective reporting.
For several years now I have taken my wife to New England for our
annual break from the insanity of life in Glasgow and surrounds.
We choose our route through the mountain passes and two horse towns to
coincide with the many Ben and Jerrys ice cream parlours.
From Kittery, the factory outlet capital of Maine, to Manchester which
sits in the Vermont hills I have drooled over the delights of Butter
Almond Toffee Crunch, Cherry Garcia, Chocolate ChipCookie Dough (my
wife's favourite), Rainforest Crunch.
The people who run Malmaison in Glasgow are no mugs and they will
never do anything smarter than be first in town to serve the sublime
sweets. The company also aims to target up-market corner shops in
Scotland.
I met Ben and Jerry yesterday in the shape of Ben Cohen and Jerry
Greenfiled. They started out in business together over 16 years ago by
investing $12,000 in converting an old petrol station in Burlington,
Vermont into a home made ice cream shop. Their range of flavours has
continued to expand over the years and Ben and Jerry's now distributes
to all 50 states of the US and has more than 100 franchised shops.
Quoted on the Nasdaq exchange in New York, Ben and Jerry's initial
share offering was to Vermont residents only, as they wanted the locals
to share in their good fortune. The stock is now around $12, making a
market capitalisation of $84m.
The company has also pioneered the growing trend towards caring
capitalism by being the world's environmentally friendly ice cream
manufacturer. Seven and a half per cent of the company's pre-tax profit
is distributed to charities in the US through Ben and Jerry's
Foundation.
So now I don't have to fly all these air miles for a fix. I just hope
familiarity doesn't breed contempt.

AJACCIO: An elderly Briton was killed and three others injured when
force-eight winds and huge waves swept their sailing boat on to rocks
off the Corsican coast. The dead sailor was named as Arthur Shepard, but
officials were unable to give his exact age or address. He died on
Monday night when his 39ft vessel Palos was smashed against rocks on the
island of Cavalo, off Bonifacio in the south of Corsica. The three
survivors were yesterday in hospital in the Corsican capital, Ajaccio.
The yacht was in a convoy of seven vessels heading for Greece from the
south of France despite bad weather.

Men may believe that they are being disadvantaged by dramatic social
changes and widening choices, both social and professional for women,
but statistically it is difficult to find figures to support that view.
In day three of the series, KIRSTY SCOTT looks at both sides of the
argument
IT'S AN advert for an insurance firm. They're not attractive, but she
looks more put together than he does. He just looks stupid. He wants to
save for the future. She wants to blow it all on travelling the world.
He wants to do the garden. She wants to stuff the garden and go on a
shopping spree. He wants to have a baby. She runs for the door.
It's a recurring theme in advertising, man as lesser-being, man as
disposable accessory, man as moron. Add it to trends showing boys in
Scotland and elsewhere slipping further and further behind the girls at
school, the apparent vilification of fathers by the Child Support
Agency, the burgeoning levels of unemployment among young working-class
men and you have, according to some, the model for a gender in crisis.
They have the statistics to prove it, they say. A suicide rate among
young Scottish men which has risen 120% in the past decade; researchers
predicting that within a generation all teachers will be female; the
fact that 80% of girls plan to go to college compared to 60% of boys;
the fact that 127,000 males aged 18-24 have been unemployed for more
than a year compared to 38,000 women.
With the spate of recent studies outlining dramatic social changes and
widening choices, both social and professional for women; and the rise
in male unemployment in Scotland due to the decline of traditional
industries, do men now have good reason to feel hard done by?
''No, I think that's nonsense,'' says Dr John MacInnes, of Edinburgh
University, who specialises in issues of masculinity. ''I think the
reason some men feel hard done by is that they are concerned at the
changes taking place at a symbolic level, in the ideological way people
think about each other.''
MacInnes, who is writing a book on men and masculinity, says comparing
old and new generational role models gives some indication of how men
feel their roles are shifting. Fifty years ago the archetypal hero was
an unemotional, courageous, decisive, strong, silent man. The women at
the time were seen as passive, negative with a hidden sexuality.
''Compare all that with today, the archetypal role model hero is a
woman with the best of both worlds, emotionally articulate, in touch
with her sisters, probably a mother, certainly involved with her
children but also successful in the public sphere. By contrast the
notion of stiff-upper-lip man is now seen as something out of date,
impractical, and a threat to the planet.
''That's happening at the level of ideologies. It's extremely
dangerous to make a direct link between these ideas and what's happening
in people's everyday lives which would allow us to say men are being
hard done by. It's a popular idea on the part of men who potentially
feel threatened by the changes that have taken place.''
The UK Men's Movement was built on the premise that men are hard done
by. It started officially last July with 380 members across the UK, and
has a particularly strong following in Scotland, although no exact
figures are currently available for the Scottish membership.
In their literature, the UKMM says urgent action is needed to bring
feminism under control and stop numerous anti-male biases. They say
feminist employment law is causing the overpromotion of women, economic
decline and reduced family incomes; and the ''anti-male ethos''
pervading schools and campuses is demotivating and demoralising boys and
young men.
One member of the UKMM in Scotland refused to talk about the group,
citing the ''rampaging political correctness of the press''. Another, a
father in his 40s, agreed to be interviewed but on the condition of
anonymity. We'll call him Adam.
''I think what we would say is that things are well out of kilter
between men and women in Scotland at the moment. Things need
redressing,'' he said.
''There's been a long time concentrating on women's issues and I feel
it's to the exclusion of men's problems. The men's movement is trying to
redress that. It has as its logo a man, woman, and child. We would
emphasise that what we are doing is really for the benefit of the whole
of society. The women's movement has concentrated on women as
individuals, an extension of the me generation. Women talk about me, me,
me.''
Adam believes that Scottish men are suffering in the same way as men
elsewhere but does not think feminism is the only cause; economic
decline and the media have played their part.
''I would say there are more opportunities for women. Ninety per cent
of jobs at the moment, as is well-crowed by a number of female
journalists in Scotland, are going to women. The fact is many of these
jobs are part-time and low-paid.
''The Scottish family is collapsing, as it is across Britain. We are
part of a massive jigsaw, one bit interlinks with another. The women's
movement is a part of this process, but there's the fact that Britain is
still in a period of economic decline . . . and there has also been a
massive denegration of men in the media.''
Adam said concerns about an entire generation of disenfranchised young
men were very real. ''Look at the street corners of Glasgow you will see
plenty of disaffected youths who see little chance of getting any kind
of legal gainful employment.''
Statistically, however, it is difficult to find figures to support the
assertion that Scottish men are now being grossly disadvantaged. Boys
may be doing less well than girls at school, but 97% of headteachers in
Scotland are male, male managers in Scotland earn 29% more than their
female counterparts and 97% of the directors of Scotland's largest
companies are men.
Dr Roger Witcomb, the national chairman of the UKMM believes, however,
that the strong UKMM membership in Scotland reveals that men north of
the Border are feeling just as marginalised as their southern
neighbours. He also believes their viewpoint is being shared a little
more widely these days.
''It is changing now,'' he said. ''It's taken a whole generation but
there is the growth of groups like ours, little indications in the
press, on TV. I think we are beginning to see little signs that the
times are changing. Groups like ours are a sort of awakening of reaction
that's setting in at last . . . there is no way it can be called
equality now, more like over-indulgence. We need to get back to
something reasonable Some protection for men's commitment to marriage
where he cannot have his home, his children, taken away from him without
a good reason.''
Allan Clark was, until he spoke to The Herald, unaware that there was
a men's movement in Scotland, let alone the UK. Clark is 23 and a
student of arts and social sciences at Strathclyde University. ''I
didn't know there was such a thing,'' he said. ''I can't say I've ever
felt an endangered species.''
Clark believes that all talk about the battle of the sexes and who's
winning the gender war should be left to the history books. It's too
''traditional'', he says, and really not applicable today.
''As far as I am concerned there is a load of sweeping generalisations
which belong in the past. But I think a lot of people rely on them
rather than taking each person for who they are and what they want to
achieve. There's too much traditionalism, people are looking back rather
than forward. Tradition is something I can't believe in.
''Once you get to university, you don't think in terms of male and
female ratios. It's not noticeable in any way; there are far too many
generalisations about men and women . . . the female friends I have made
at university are sure of what they want and where they want to go. I
don't think they really spend much time thinking about it. They're too
busy getting on with their lives.''
He doesn't feel he has been disadvantaged in any way by being male and
believes feminism is now treated in a similar fashion by both male and
female students. They've covered it as a concept as part of the syllabus
in his sociology classes and Clark says it generated as many yawns from
the female members of the class as from the male. ''It was obvious that
the females were finding it as interesting as the males, God what are we
doing here. This is so boring.''
As for the adverts which depict his sex as the buffoon, the fall guy,
Clark takes it all as a bit of a joke and nothing to get steamed up
about. ''I think advertisers are trying to redress the balance a bit. As
far as I'm concerned I don't feel threatened by it at all. It's just a
laugh.''
Roger Witcomb, however, sees a more sinister slant to it. He said it's
part of a wider denegration of men which runs throughout the media and
is causing deep offence to men and to some women. ''It's a cultural
fashion and it's very, very offensive,'' he says. ''It bothers me about
the effect it will have on schoolboys.''
Euan Crumley is aged 17 and in his 6th year at Stirling High School.
From his point of view, advertisements that portray men as lesser beings
are a source of amusement rather than consternation. ''I find them quite
funny, actually,'' he said. ''I don't think we as men are being ignored
. . . but there's still many people who see the men's position being at
the top of the tree . . . I think the emphasis should be on equality,
that the female does have as many rights as the male. I certainly don't
think opportunities have been cut for men by any stretch of the
imagination.''
Euan, who's hoping to get in to drama school, agrees with the recent
research which suggested young women were much more confident than their
male peers and were doing better at school.
''I've always had the impression that girls in general seem much more
confident in the school environment than boys. It seems they can adapt a
lot quicker, they seem to mature a lot quicker than boys as well.''
He thinks feminism has achieved pretty much what it set out to but
shouldn't be discarded too readily. ''There has always got to be
protection there so that women won't be discriminated against.''
That said, he sometimes feels that there is something of a pc culture
in Scotland which affects how he interacts with the opposite sex.
''I certainly feel that sometimes when you are talking to the opposite
sex, especially if it's someone you don't know very well, you've got to
watch very very carefully what you are saying.''
MacInnes, meanwhile, is encouraged by the general debate on men's and
women's roles in Scotland and elsewhere, as the sexes try to find some
sort of new balance.
''The disintegration of clear ideas about what masculinity comprises,
what is a real man is in a sense quite a healthy indicator of the way
gender relations are in a state of flux at the moment and I think that's
maybe a good thing.''
He is quite clear, however, that closer examination of the shift does
not reveal a complete swing to the women's side.
''Inequalities might be lessening in some ways, in some areas, but
really when you look at it, not that much.''

Eric Kennedy meets the instigator of a pioneering American scheme for
teenagers in high-risk areas which is to be piloted in Scotland
''MY dream is not to die in poverty but to have poverty die in me.''
The speaker is an attractive American girl in her late teens who gazes
at the camera with a confident smile.
She is one of a number of young people featured in a remarkable video
to be seen by conference delegates tomorrow. It will make an impression
for two reasons: the first is that the youngsters are from high-risk
areas and have benefited from a pioneering entrepreneurial scheme, and
the second is that this scheme is to be tried out in Scotland.
Tomorrow's presentation is by Steve Mariotti, a teacher by profession
who launched the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship in
the US in 1987. Spurred on by the fact that more than 1,000,000
high-school pupils between the ages of 15 and 20 had dropped out and
were now unemployed, and that 11,500 more were dropping out every year,
he saw the scheme as a money-making alternative to street gangs and
drugs.
Instead of the scrap heap, why not instil such youngsters with
business literacy, through a hands-on approach to creating their own
businesses? Mariotti felt from the start that self-esteem was
all-important, and so it has proved. Participants learn about balance
sheets, wholesaling, gaining start-up capital, trading, income
statements, work sheets, supply and demand, time management, record
keeping, business ethics, budgeting, and taxes.
They go through what is in effect a simplified MBA course with the
emphasis on practical experience and with the backing of private money.
They get a ''bizbag'' containing books and advice on entrepreneurship.
The 80-hour course also consists of field visits to the local stock
exchange, writing their own business plans, designing their business
cards, going to a bank and opening their own savings account with the
start-up capital provided under the scheme, and investing this capital
in the wholesale market for retailing later on.
It is described as ''an exit strategy from poverty'' for at-risk youth
and it seems to work. Other youngsters interviewed in the video talk of
being ''more punctual, more responsible, and more confident.''
And of the 5000 or so who have been through the course, 14% have
continued on the entrepreneurship path with small businesses such as
fast-food and retailing concerns. Others have proved substantially more
successful than average at getting and retaining employment and even
statistics for such social ills as unwanted teenage pregnancies and drug
abuse have dropped among participants.
The non-profitmaking National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship
has bought a restaurant in New Jersey to teach hands-on catering skills,
and has a Trade Centre in the South Bronx which acts as a business
incubator.
It even teaches course participants how to read The Wall Street
Journal -- which is, incidentally, only one of the main press and
broadcast media to have featured the foundation in special programmes.
It will no doubt find itself featured in the British media this year,
as plans for a pilot project in Scotland are well advanced. During his
Scottish visit, Steve Mariotti will be talking to Scottish Enterprise
National about adapting the entrepreneurship scheme to the situation in
this country.
Scotland, while not perhaps on the scale of the Bronx, does have its
share of dropouts and youngsters at risk.
The de-mystifying of business, and the need for self-respect, are just
as desirable here and Steve Mariotti will be providing training for
those who will initially be involved in setting up the Scottish
operation.
Meanwhile it is interesting to reflect that he is coming to a country
which leads not only the United States but also the world in the highly
successful Young Enterprise scheme.
The statistics for Young Enterprise Scotland, which encourages fifth
and sixth-year pupils to set up small businesses in their final year at
school, are staggering. About 4000 youngsters are involved every year --
in 1995 the number is 4200 -- and 60% of schools are participants.
That represents the biggest per capita penetration in the world and
chief executive Owen McGhee is justly proud of Young Enterprise
Scotland's achievements. Like Steve Mariotti, he is interested in
helping young people fulfil their potential but Young Enterprise does
not have too many similarities in its entrepreneurial approach.
For one thing, it is more wide-ranging and not confined to pupils in
at-risk areas or situations. For another, the businesses involved are
compulsorily wound up at the end of the school year.
Meanwhile only the realities of business are there -- the highs and
lows, the butterflies, the students' need to understand themselves and
other people. About 274 companies have been founded this year, with
enterprises including garden furniture, tapes of nursery rhymes in
Gaelic, T-shirts, jewellery, letterheads, newspapers, teaching adults to
use personal computers, and board games.
Although the companies are wound up, many are resurrected by previous
participants with some success. Whether this happens or not, the
students have learned invaluable lessons about themselves and the world
of work.
Owen McGhee and two other representatives will be leading a ''Steal
and Share'' session on Friday at which he will describe the relevance of
the Young Enterprise experience in today's world and argue for the
necessity to equip Scotland's young people with the skills it imparts.
Nearly 900 volunteers, he says, are involved in making Young
Enterprise Scotland a success in 260 of Scotland's 380 secondaries. ''I
have been involved for 14 years now,'' he says, ''and my target is to
have 100% penetration of our secondary schools.''

WE all feel anger and disgust at the monstrous act against humanity,
perpetrated in Oklahoma City recently, and welcome swift and just
retribution on the inhuman criminals involved.
What I found particularly disturbing was the wild, inflammatory
reporting by many of the so-called popular press and broadcasting media
in this country; eager to throw blame against Islam and the Middle East
as usual, without due care and consideration.
It was media unprofessionalism at its worst, frightening to those who
seek a balance of truth and impartiality in reporting.
Particularly reassuring, thankfully, were a number of moderate
statements issuing from the United States which stressed it was too
early to indicate responsibility to the Middle East factor. President
Clinton stated that, too.
It appears that a militant white organisation is now implicated in the
atrocity and the rabble-rousers, being confronted with these new
concrete facts, flying in the face of their biased and preconceived
motives, are now totally dumbstruck and bemused.
When will the media start educating their readers with balanced
reporting from representatives of all political shades of the Middle
East spectrum?
The recent shoddy display has been most unprofessional, deeply
disturbing, and totally undeserving of respect. The Herald is not
included in this category, I hasten to add.

THE slaughter of the innocent as in Oklahoma is always a blight
against humanity. But I listened, not without surprise, to two Americans
on the radio, regretting the fact that Saddam Hussein and Colonel
Gaddafi were not speedily killed at an earlier stage since they were
obviously in some way connected.
The slaughter is now known to be home-grown.
The Americans, with the praise and connivance of Major and the
British, slaughtered thousands of Iraqi civilians and children during
the oil Gulf war. Gaddafi had one of his infant children murdered by
Reagan when he needed a boost in the polls. All this murder was to be
admired, apparently.
As the saying goes: what goes around comes around. And the innocent
die

GOVERNMENT assistance to the Scottish salmon industry should be
re-directed into the provision of support for the development and
evaluation of value added products, the House of Commons Scottish
Affairs Committee recommended yesterday.
Until now the emphasis on the research side has been aimed at
increasing the efficiency of production rather than product development.
''It is clear that the continuing expansion in salmon production volumes
will make it increasingly difficult to sustain a quality price premium
for fresh whole Scottish salmon,'' the committee said. Industry analysts
have argued forcibly that the future will only be secured by innovative
product development.''
The committee adopted that view and recommended that Scottish salmon
producers must consider innovative product development along the lines
of the poultry industry's successful push for market growth through
processed and semi-processed products.
''Scottish industry representatives appeared reluctant to accept the
need for a strategic shift in marketing beyond fresh whole fish, or
fillets and steaks in portions, or smoked salmon,'' the report said. It
conceded ''there may have been an understandable shudder among witnesses
from the Scottish Salmon Growers Association at the prospect of Salmon
McNuggets.''
Because new product development is costly and requires capital
investment the committee recommended that support for that area of work
could be provided by a shift of government resources away from research
and development projects currently aimed at increasing efficiency of
production.
The Scottish industry is commended in the report for its success in
developing a marketing strategy to differentiate its product from
Norwegian salmon -- and to establish a price premium. This has been
achieved by professional promotional and advertising campaigns,
underpinned by quality assurance schemes. Budget expenditure in that
regard was was #1.3m in 1993 -- of which half came from the industry and
half from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. A quality price premium for
Scottish salmon was achieved in wholesale markets and the industry also
attained Label Rouge status in France, yielding a further premium of up
to 3%.
Norway's rejection of European Union membership is seen as a window of
opportunity for the Scottish salmon industry to develop added value
processed products and to benefit from a margin of protection from
duties imposed on processed imports.
A simmering international trade dispute between Scottish and Norwegian
fish farmers provides the background to the report. Scottish salmon
farmers have alleged both illegal dumping in EU markets and unfair
subsidies. They have pressed the UK Government to support their goal of
forming producer organisations with powers, through the Common Fisheries
Policy, to control the production of salmon.
The Scottish Affairs Committee underlined the importance of the salmon
industry to the economy of the Highlands and Islands by pointing out
that its estimated output value of #200m was greater than that for beef
and sheep.
Scottish salmon production is estimated to have reached between 58,000
and 60,000 tonnes last year and is predicted to rise to 70,000 tonnes by
1996. Norwegian figures put their output at three times the Scottish
level, giving them the dominant position in the European market.
The recent rapid expansion in production has precipitated repeated
crises in salmon prices, the committee said. Norwegian evidence revealed
that their farms on average made losses between 1990 and 1992. In 1993
they barely broke even. No data was presented to the committee on the
profitability of the Scottish industry.
Given the importance of production cost data for the implementation of
policy the committee makes a strong recommendation that an annual
independent cost of production and profitability survey should be
commissioned by the Scottish Office. The committee expresses
reservations, however, about the establishment of producer organisations
with powers to regulate production. Restriction of growth in European
salmon could simply open up opportunities for countries such as Chile to
export into Europe.
''The Scottish Office will need to monitor market prices closely over
the next two years as production volumes surge. The Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department should take the lead role and be
prepared for a speedy approach to the European Commission in support of
the Scottish salmon industry on implementing minimum import prices,
should market circumstances dictate.''

THE latest episode of the murder of Rwandans appallingly illustrates
the difficulty of external intervention in a country's affairs (April
24).
The international community normally only becomes involved if invited
by the host government.
Previous slaughters, including the discovery of the Holocaust, are
examples of this reluctance. But prevention of atrocities seems
impossible as long as we revere the sovereign state.

JOHN MACLEOD is obviously after Jack McLean's position as the Prince
of Diatribe. His article on Ireland is incorrect and his language
flippant and sensational (April 18).
In these precarious times in the island of Ireland religiously bigoted
articles written by amateurish Scottish journalists are unforgivable.
John Macleod is a dinosaur in terms of his ''thinking'' on the Irish
question, and so typical of the ''Proddy'' versus ''Tim'' mentality that
remains in the West of Scotland.

JOHN MACLEOD'S article Brotherhood of Blood may be summed up thus: I
hate Catholics, I particularly hate Irish Catholics (April 18).
That you should choose to publish such wicked nonsense both surprises
and disappoints me. Macleod knows little of Ireland and understands
less.
He would seem to be the only journalist in Britain unaware of the
existence of the UVF and UFF; unaware of the presence in Ulster prisons
of so-called loyalists convicted of murder by both the bomb and the
bullet: unaware of the presence in Ulster of his co-religionists proud
to boast their willingness to kill and be killed for what they see as
their cause.
By no stretch of the imagination can it be argued that alone in Ulster
do Sinn Fein have blood on their hands.
One has to ask by what process of divination Macleod arrives at the
conclusion that Scottish nationalism is a legitimate political movement
but Irish nationalism is not. Is it simply that he does not know of any
Catholics who are members of the SNP?
At least on one point Macleod accidentally touches upon a truth, that
British rule in Ulster can be described as fascist. Democracy is a
stranger in the Six Counties. Had there been no reason to form a
Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, the last 27 years of mayhem
would never have happened.
A Special Powers Act might have been used by the Nazis as a model for
their establishment of the Gestapo State.

Anvar Khan meets actress Britt Ekland and finds a woman's woman who
has life taped
WHEN Britt Ekland, 52, entered The Lamont Suite at the Forte Crest
Hotel in Glasgow, in tight jeans, black leather winkle-picker boots, a
black top and man's-size hacking jacket, the attendant tabloid hack and
photographer faked respect to give her a false sense of security.
When the time came for pix, Ekland was asked to remove her jacket, in
the same, coaxing tones, as her old film directors when it came to love
scenes. (She said no.)
Ekland has become accustomed to both men and women inveigling
themselves into her life. She was under the impression, for example,
that her alleged friend, the socialite and PR for the rich, English,
upper-class intelligentsia, Liz Brewer, invited her to a gallery opening
out of kindness. But Ekland's presence was being used to illustrate a TV
documentary instead.
When the cameras followed her into a hall full of arty-farty, gaggling
dealers, the reporter asked quite correctly, ''Why are you here?'' to
which Ekland replied, correctly, ''Because I was invited''.
When Ekland is manipulated it makes her look, in her own words,
''stupid''. The incident was a testament to the cut-throat, grasping
world of cafe society, where the integrity and reliability of stars can
be used as a means of humiliation.
Before emarking on The Herald interview, Ekland offered me water,
asked if I minded the fresh air billowing into the room, and sat down on
the couch. Her gargantuan fame reduced my personality to a blip. She
smiled at me, alert and expectant, while I explained that I had seen her
on the telly when I was younger, and grew up with an image of Ekland
being an absolute siren, the epitome of sex appeal.
I swear she looked disappointed, but as her cheeks fell, her face
settled into a look of relief. I later learned that by complimenting her
on what she actually has, makes a change from the usual accusations of
what she has allegedly borrowed, undeserved, like fame.
When Ekland was told she was the most beautiful woman in the world, it
meant nothing to her. ''When you are young and beautiful you take it for
granted. The people who have to work hard at being attractive are the
only ones who give it a thought. It didn't make any difference to my
life.''
Ekland seduced Sellars, Beatty and Stewart (not that this is proof of
her attractiveness, more theirs, however fleeting). In the index at the
back of the story of her life, such names are writ large but are of
least importance. Men have a curious outlook on women.
Ask the average man about Ekland and he'll probably say that if she
was good enough for Rod then she's good enough for him. Ekland has been
a trophy. In sexist, hypocritical Hollywood, the woman is always the
Eve. Her gender has always been enough to dismiss her as the evil one.
''The ultimate power, of course, is money,'' chats Ekland. ''The
ugliest man in the world can be surrounded by the youngest and the most
beautiful women. As a woman, I have fame but I have no power.''
Ekland is a woman's woman. She respects women in business, such as
Anita Roddick ''because she cares''. It is more important for her to be
liked by women than by men. ''I would say I am a feminist. I like women;
I stand up for women. They generally get a worse deal than the men do.''
Ekland sits with her arms folded. She thinks about every question,
there are no pat answers. She also makes a lot of faces according to
which emotional level she is referring to. She must be very long
sighted. When I showed her a news clipping from a pile of research she
literally lifted the paper to her nose and squinted, ''What's the date
on that?'' like a fussing professor. When I ask her how she would define
her role in life, she says: ''Stressful.''
Ekland is currently touring Scotland with the play Run For Your Wife,
a farce in which she plays the wife of a bigamist. ''It's a strange
theatre,'' she says of The Pavilion, ''such a big stage, and that bit
that sticks out, it's almost like being on a boat.''
Ekland was always going to intimidate. She has a no-nonsense,
Scandinavian directness, the opposite of British stuffiness and
sensibility. The straightforward attitude to sex of the Swedish for
example, has always frightened the English.
''I don't live a life that is worth writing about,'' she states. ''Now
I am working towards a career in the theatre. I won't do anything that
is smutty. I have had to compromise. In movies you had to take your
clothes off whether you wanted to or not. In those days it wasn't
connected to the plot, they just wanted to see a bit of bum. I had a
very hard time doing it. I laugh at it now, but I remember doing these
love scenes and they wanted your body like this . . .''
Ekland shufties along the sofa and introduces a length of thigh and a
curve of hip in the manner of a magician's assistant.
''So I used to take a tan bodystocking, and cut it up at the crotch
here, and cut it round my nipples there, and then put black camera tape
on them and round my inner thigh. If the camera went up or down further
than required they'd get the black tape in the film. It hurt like hell
to pull it off, but it was worth it.''
Ekland is a strong woman, and seems very much alone, because she has
an independent mind.
''I have always been an outsider. I don't really belong anywhere. I
was born in Sweden. I grew up in England, I came to Britain when I was
very young, and then spent the next 15-odd years in America. I have no
roots anywhere. I would love to be able to say, these are my traditions,
but I don't have any.''
How do you compensate for a lack of roots? ''You become very attached
to things and you don't want to get rid of them; it could be a piece of
clothing, or a piece of furniture.
''Your possessions become your security blanket and wherever you go
you take them with you. My house looks like a shop. I have things in
suitcases. People ask, but why? I can't bear to throw them away. I have
to keep something which reminds me of the past.
''I have lived my life day by day. I have never planned anything apart
from my last child. Whatever happens, happens. As I mature I think about
the future more. But I don't want to live that way emotionally, I want
to live for today. But it's difficult when you reach a certain age.
Growing older brings you that. You know too much about life.''
* Run For Your Wife is at The Pavilion until Saturday. It then goes to
Inverness and then Edinburgh.
* Anvar Khan is UK Feature Writer of the Year.
Now I am working towards a career in the theatre. I won't do anything
that is smutty. I have had to compromise. In movies you had to take your
clothes off whether you wanted to or not

GLASGOW Abattoir Co Ltd is in receivership (April 20).
Does not the sad announcement justify some argument that we should be
slaughtering our own home-grown calves here and not sending them to the
affluent abattoirs in France, Holland, Belgium, and even to the fishing
cheats in Spain?
Our farming policy is sadly lacking in proper direction if we do not
even process our own meat-market trade.
If we kept our own home-grown calves and let them grow free range, I
am sure we could carve ourselves a particular high-class niche for
Scottish hand-reared super free-range veal.
It could be sold at a high price for the finest European tastes, and
restaurants for gourmets. Prepacked and frozen here, creating even more
jobs in packaging.

THE late Jimmy Ross, the legendary chief reporter of the Glasgow
Herald, used to drum into his reporters the need to get balance into
their stories. ''Remember,'' Jimmy would tell us, ''there is always two
sides to a story.''
What a pity that Peter T McCann did not get some balance into his
comments on the relationship between Glasgow District Council and
Strathclyde Regional Council (April 19).
Mr McCann accuses many of those elected to the regional council as
displaying ''an arrogance becoming to their self-considered upper-league
status''.
One wonders if he includes Geoff Shaw, the first convener of SRC, and
Dick Stewart, the council leader, among them. If so, he casts a slur on
the memory of two of the most outstanding figures in the history of
Scottish local government.
My recollection of the early days of Strathclyde is of Geoff Shaw time
after time offering the Biblical other cheek in the face of the utmost
provocation from outwith Melrose House (the then SRC headquarters).
Some of us were astonished at, and at the same time full of admiration
for, the way Geoff Shaw soaked up the hostility directed at Strathclyde
without using his position to hit back.
He was indeed the suffering servant of 2.5 million people in
Strathclyde and he paid the penalty with his untimely death 17 years ago
next Friday (April 28). How we miss him still.
There was nothing arrogant about Geoff Shaw or Dick Stewart. These
were men of vision, completely free of pretence, and abounding in the
qualities of compassion, honesty, and integrity. My hope and prayer is
that these qualities will not be lost in the new unitary authorities.

UNITED Auctions, whose main markets are at Perth and Stirling, have
reported record profits of #837,339 -- an increase of #54,000 over the
previous year. Kildean market at Stirling turned in a 20% increase in
profits and operations at Dalmally and the islands were considered to
have done particularly well, considering the local competition, said
chief executive Alan McGregor.
Perth recorded an 11% increase in turnover, leading to a 42% jump in
profits.
William Bosomworth &amp; Sons, United's wholesale meat company was said to
have fulfilled expectations and UA Forestry, UA Properties and United
Auctions (Offset Printers) also traded profitably.
''I am confident that the money presently being invested and the many
changes made during the past year will lead to greater profits, although
it may take time for the benefits to be realised,'' said Mr McGregor.
''Investment and diversification are essential for the long term success
of the company.
The directors are recommending a dividend of 20p per share -- as
against 15p last year -- and a two-for-one free scrip issue.
In the last three years the company's net borrowings have fallen by
#4.84m from #7.68m to #2.84m. In a statement, chairman John Izat said
facilities for customers continued to be improved and during the year to
January 31 authorised capital expenditure of #1.08m had been carried
out. The board was confident that the overall trend of profits would
continue to improve in the future.
Alan Watson has been appointed managing director at Kildean Market,
after the retirement of Morton Strachan. Mr Watson has been with the
company for 37 years, and was assistant managing director at Kildean. He
will have overall responsibility for the company's west coast markets at
Dalmally, Fort William, Tarbert, and the islands of Islay, Tiree and
South Uist.
Plans for the creation of a partnership to run the auction market at
Dingwall have been approved by both United Auctions directors and the
''A'' shareholders of Dingwall Auction Mart.
The first sale of prime stock under the new partnership will be held
on May 2, with the first store stock sale the following day.
George McCallum, managing director of the new company, said that its
formation should end all the long-running speculation about the future
of livestock markets in the area. ''We look forward to ensuring that
farmers in the north of Scotland have a first-class livestock marketing
service,'' he said.

NATIONAL &amp; Provincial Building Society has given a cool response to
Abbey National's request for talks that could lead to a merger. In a
formal statement, it said that it was surprised that Abbey had issued a
unilateral press announcement on Monday.
It added that it had no intention of being bounced into any course of
action by the activities of a third party.
Two weeks ago, it was arranged that Abbey's chief executive Peter
Birch and N&amp;P's Alastair Lyons would meet on May 1 to discuss the
possibilities of a merger which would create Britain's largest retail
bank with assets of #105bn -- Abbey #92.2bn and N&amp;P #13.2bn -- and well
in excess of the proposed Halifax and Leeds Permanent's #91bn.
This morning's annual meeting in Bradford will attract many more N&amp;P
investors than the 38 who turned up last year although they are not
likely to learn very much other than that N&amp;P is looking at all
possibilities and that it is in talks with several potential partners.
The tenor of the Abbey approach has led many to speculate that this
could be the first hostile bid for a building society.
The Lloyds Bank acquisition of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester was a meeting
of minds and possibly also a very expensive way of finding a successor
to Lloyds chief executive Sir Brian Pitman in the shape of C&amp;G's Andrew
Longhurst. The Halifax-Leeds get-together appears to have been a
friendly affair so far.
The high level of publicity may have put the N&amp;P board slightly on the
defensive already and made most investors responsive to Abbey's possible
blandishments which could amount to perhaps #600 per qualifying account.

The chairman of Northern Rock Building Society said he was determined
to keep the society independent even though others were either merging
or being targeted by banks.
Mr Dickinson said Northern Rock's continuing financial success as a
mutually-owned organisation had led its board to conclude that ''it
should seek to remain North East of England-based, independent and, as
long as it remains in the interests of members in the longer term, a
mutual building society''.

THE National Health Service appears to have been enduring reform for
many, many years. Perhaps that is just how it feels, both to patients
and staff. It is undeniable that some reform was required and that
various areas of the service needed to be organised along more logical
and efficient lines. The actual result of some of the ensuing reforms,
with all that they have meant for the burgeoning of bureaucracy, the
wrenching dislocation, and the seemingly inexorable progress towards a
two-tier system, is best laid aside for the moment. The simple question
is why, if radical reform was in the air, did it take until last year
for the health authorities to begin the process of removing the
appalling and unsafe hours worked by junior doctors? The medical
profession must bear at least some of the blame for this. Medicine as it
is practised in Britain has fostered a number of myths, one of which is
the need to be tough and strong if you are to succeed. Faced with junior
doctors working utterly ridiculous hours, consultants and senior doctors
were only too likely to respond that they had worked them without harm
when they were juniors, so why shouldn't the youngsters? As an example
of bone-headed thinking this is hard to beat, but under the unreformed
health service it is arguable that consultants had too much power
anyway.
Nowadays they have less power, at least in non-clinical matters, but
it has taken some deeply unfortunate cases involving overworked junior
doctors for the system to begin slowly to change. A reminder of this
came yesterday when Dr Chris Johnstone's long-running case against
Camden and Islington Health Authority in London was settled finally. The
details of his progressive physical degradation while working anything
up to 120 hours a week make distressing reading. It was not uncommon for
junior doctors to work these hours in 1989 and it is only fair that the
injustice of that system should have been recognised, even if the health
authority, taking the requirements of the law to their asinine limits,
refuses to accept its responsibility.
Unfortunately, the matter does not end with Dr Johnstone, for the
reforming of junior doctors' hours limps along with a curiously slow
gait, certainly when compared with the indecent haste of some other
health service reforms. Junior doctors in some areas are contracted now
to work no more than 72 hours each week. This is still a great number of
hours, and while young doctors might be able to cope physically with
such a regime, it is doubtful if they can be expected to maintain a
uniform mental and intellectual alertness over such a time. It would be
of benefit to both doctors and patients if this reform could be
accelerated and all junior doctors brought swiftly into a system of more
reasonable working hours. One thing is certain: we must never return to
the obvious dangers of a system where patients' lives are in doctors'
hands which tremble with exhaustion.

YOUR article, Nights on the road (April 21), highlights an old
problem. As a GP in Alva (1976-84) I once paid 53 house-calls over one
weekend on duty (Friday 6pm -- Monday 9am).
This is really a problem of the proper use of manpower in primary
health care. I have long advocated the use of three grades of suitably
trained paramedical staff at the point of first contact with the
patients.
The clinical associate would be trained in the diagnosis and treatment
of the problems commonly encountered in general practice, run surgeries,
and prescribe from a restricted range of drugs.
The community nurse would carry out nursing duties in the community
and be responsible for visiting all patients in a designated area on a
regular basis. The nursing aide would be responsible for the general
bodily care of housebound patients.
The GP would act in his capacity as a ''specialist generalist'', run
surgeries and see patients referred by the clinical associate.
This system would provide coverage in time and space, permit shift
work, obviate the necessity for deputising services, ensure that
patients receive 24-hour coverage by medical personnel from within their
own practice, and encourage and improve teamwork within the practice.
It would also be far more efficient and cost-effective.

ARE we in Scotland to lose yet another high-quality engineering

We are at present witnessing the death-throes of one of Scotland's

Scottish company which provides 1750 high-quality jobs and injects more
than #100 million a year into the Scottish economy.
We must take issue with those who plan to hijack one of our major
high-technology engineering institutions. The loss would be criminal.
I believe that the White Paper on the nuclear industry will be
unveiled on May 9, directing that the nuclear industry in Scotland be
subsumed by its larger English equivalent.
That scenario should not be allowed to come about both from the
Scottish and from the engineering point of view.
This is no parochial whinge, either. Without a national nuclear-energy
source, we will squander not only the research which has brought the
resource to its present level, but we will immediately lose any foreign
markets which are being targeted. At present Scottish Nuclear is engaged
in high-technology exchange work with Russia and the Ukraine.
Has that market to be ignored? And what of the recently opened bamboo
curtain: are we to be denied any chance of competing in the developing
Chinese market?
Scottish engineering has given the world so much. We must not just sit
back and watch such a life-blood industry die at the hands of
bureaucracy.

THERE can be a number of motives for lavishing praise on a political
opponent. Not all of them are totally honourable.
As a debating technique in the House of Commoms it can be very useful
-- first lull your opponent into dropping his guard and then deliver the
rapier-like thrust to the vital organs.
For example, to tell a Tory minister that he is normally a shining
example of integrity in public life but on this particular occasion
seems to have been caught with his hands in the cookie jar can sometimes
be more effective than saying he is a low-life swine whose each and
every political action has been a deceit of the electorate.
Similarly, praising a former minister exiled to the back benches can
assist in making an unfavourable contrast with his front-bench
successor. This is a much-used device in the Palace of Enchantments.
Sometimes the target of praise is a convenient six feet under. In this
way the artful politician can both be generous to a fallen foe while
dodging the normal unfortunate consequences that the remarks might be
used one day as an endorsement. A statesman after all is a dead
politician.
But Margaret Thatcher is not dead and although she is retired her
inheritance still dominates the political landscape. Her disciples,
rather in the manner of the gruesome undead from an old Hammer film,
still stalk the corridors of the Commons, the Lords, and even occupy
seats round the Cabinet table.
Therefore, when Tony Blair decided to unburden himself of his
admiration for this ''thoroughly determined person'' to the Sunday Times
he must have had a substantial reason for taking something of a
political risk. Even the Labour Party isn't so totally cowed as not to
raise an uncomfortable eyebrow at praise for the woman who for more than
a decade was presented by them as the incarnation of evil.
We should not totally discount the possibility that Blair actually
believes that the great dame provided Britain with ''needed change at
the end of the 1970s''.
A few months back a Labour Euro MP, Ken Coates, spluttered that Blair
was nothing more than a ''Liberal'' -- presumably the most damning
insult that came to mind. For a long time I have had Tony identified as
a Tory, a nice Tory, but still a Tory.
We could both be wrong. It is possible that the Labour Party have
actually elected Thatcher's political child as their leader. After all,
it is not unknown for left-of-centre parties to move dramatically to
outflank their Conservative opponents.
Certainly when it comes to some political qualities there is an
arguable case that Blair is intent on playing the role of the nineties
man of steel to Thatcher's Iron Lady. No-one in the Labour Party now
believes they can kick sand in Bambi's eye.
Both leaders expressed contempt for the political baggage they had
inherited. Thatcher believed she was the first worthy Tory Prime
Minister since Churchill. Blair seems desperately short of any Labour
heroes at all.
If anything, Blair has already kissed the ''luvvies'' a less than fond
farewell and is now rounding in most uncomradely fashion on the big
brothers in the big unions. All this and he is still in opposition.
I find it inconceivable, however, that even ''Tory'' Blair is actually
a Thatcher groupie. Recently I read Ian Gilmour's elegant account of the
Thatcher years, Dancing with Dogma.
Gilmour dissects the folly of Thatcherism from the vantage point of
one of her early Cabinet ministers. And while he, like Blair, concedes
her a few successes he rounds on the manifest failure of her overall
policy.
In particular Gilmour devotes his most scathing attention to the
economic carnage of the early 1980s when the Thatcher Government
deflated into the teeth of a recession that they themselves had largely
created.
In the space of little more than two years around one-fifth of the
manufacturing capacity of the economy was wiped out. Admittedly the
surviving firms had a higher average rate of productivity. It was, as
one wag put it at the time, rather like increasing the average health of
the remaining population by shooting everyone who couldn't run a
four-minute mile.
It is a remarkable circumstance when a Tory wet can summon up an
anti-Thatcher passion beyond that of the Leader of the Labour Party. But
then Ian Gilmour is no longer trawling for votes round the saloon bars
of ''middle'' England.
The fact is that Blair is not a Thatcher disciple, just a politician
on the make. The calculation is that it plays well among former Thatcher
admirers, rocked by the uncertainties of the Major period, to spin a bit
of praise at the old girl -- a touch of nostalgia for the time when tax
cuts were tax cuts and a privatisation issue was sold at a decent
discount.
It may play well in ''middle'' England. Of course in ''mainstream''
Scotland we might prefer to remember when a health service was a health
service and when utilities were run for the public good, not the private
greed of their chief executives.
We might also remember that the whole ghastly experiment was
bankrolled by #100,000m of Scottish oil wealth and conclude that it
might be best to concentrate on rehabilitating Scotland rather than Lady
Thatcher's reputation.

ONE of the biggest tactical blunders in modern British political
history was brought to a close yesterday, but the repercussions will
rumble on. The Prime Minister's offer to readmit the nine Tory Euro
rebels to the parliamentary party gives off many signals; none of them
is particularly impressive and some are deeply worrying. To judge by
their statements yesterday the rebels are utterly unrepentant. They
insist, and Sir Teddy Taylor was prominent in this, that there has been
a sea-change in the Tory party over Europe. There have always been
extremists on both sides of the argument, said Sir Teddy (at least
displaying the grace to admit his own extremism), but the burden of his
comments was that the bulk of the middle ground of the Tory party had
now moved over to his position. Is he right, and if he is, does it
matter? Frankly it is unlikely that the bulk of the party now supports
Sir Teddy and his rebellious colleagues. Opinions against Europe do
appear to have hardened, but much of this rests in the realm of
instinctive reactions of the dubiously nationalistic kind. Faced with
the sustained outrage and cogent arguments of serious British exporting
firms, only the zealots or the acutely deranged amongst Tory MPs could
persist in their chauvinism. What does exist, and there is not the
slightest doubt of it, is a considerable degree of distaste towards the
rebels on the part of MPs who value loyalty to the party above
factionalism. The reply of the rebels to this charge is that they
represent the will of the people. This is the refuge of the demagogue
and populist down through the ages. Sir Teddy and Co really should know
better
If Sir Teddy is right, and the bulk of the Tory party now leans
towards his anti-Europeanism, then it matters a very great deal. The
improvement in our economy is based on exporting, principally to Europe.
This effect will be enhanced in coming months as our European markets
emerge from their corner of the recession. Export success is largely a
matter of knowing your market and selling into it at the right price.
But sentiment does play a part and there is little doubt that further
manifestations of anti-EU feelings within the governing party will do
little to help our long-term prospects. This has a direct link with the
claim of victory heard from the rebels yesterday. Not only are they
unrepentant, but they believe they have won. Again, Sir Teddy was
specific. He believes that their victory means that the Government will
not dare bring forward any legislation to enable further compliance with
EU policies, especially if they involve money. If this is true it will
amount to an abrogation of responsibility by the Government which will
be utterly unacceptable to the country. If it is wrong, it can only mean
that the rebels and Mr Major will be on collision course once more.
The Prime Minister's part in all of this is, admittedly in retrospect,
barely believable. He did not have the authority to impose his will,
even on an issue of confidence, and had to resort to the tactic of
expelling the rebels from the parliamentary party. All sorts of
arm-twisting and pressure followed, with even the notably level-headed
Nicholas Budgen alleging that attempts had been made to de-select the
nine. Many rebel media interviews later, with the local authority
elections in England and Wales looming and alleged messages from the
doorsteps claiming the public desire for a united party, Mr Major
collapsed. No guarantees have been offered on either side; the Tory
party is split, resentful, and fearful of the consequences at the ballot
box next week, and only a fool would consider that yesterday's events
provide any sort of resolution to the whole affair. The problems of the
Tory party are one thing; the conduct of British affairs in the EU are
quite another. Mr Major has tried the carrot and he has tried the stick.
If the Government finds itself circumscribed in the future by the need
to bow to the demands of a small number of extremists the country will
consider the situation intolerable.

THE Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) in Glasgow
sharply boosted its net profit to #158,000 in the year to September on
slightly increased turnover of #6.2m because of better margins and cost
control.
''The forecast for the current year is for a strong improvement in
turnover and a further significant increase in profits,'' said Edward
Cunningham, the chairman of Scottish Exhibition Centre (SEC), which owns
and operates the facility.
Mr Cunningham said in a statement accompanying the results that SEC
expected its insurers to pay for repairs to extensive flood damage
caused by the river Kelvin burst its banks in December.
He noted that SEC had achieved a 250% increase in net profits last
year, thanks to cost controls and higher margins, with turnover rising
only 4.5%.
Mr Cunningham said results for October to December showed a
significant improvement over the same period of 1993, but gave no
details

SCOTTISH Amicable has sold 216,000 shares in Devon-based ballclay
producer Watts Blake Bearne which enabled Sibleco to increase its
holding earlier this month by 1% to 48.66% at 485p. The Belgian silica
sand group made a formal bid for WBB two years ago at 420p after it
acquired the holdings of two other substantial shareholders.
However, that was seen off because of the loyalty of institutions led
by M&amp;G -- it bought shares above the offer price -- and the small
private shareholders who treasured the local connection.
Sibelco has three seats on the board of the company founded 285 years
ago and is allowed to increase its stake by 1% annually so that it will
be able to achieve control in two years time without making an offer to
other shareholders. It is believed that Scottish Amicable has been
trying to sell at least part of its holding totalling 661,000 shares or
3.18% since the beginning of the year.
It seems a pity that such a successful niche player as WBB -- it is
undoubted world leader in ballclay technology with excellent prospects
-- should lose its independence.

Mary Brennan meets Judy Garland's daughter, Lorna Luft, who has a
no-nonsense approach to showbiz and life
OUT in the spotlight, head high, torching the hall with Nancy's sad,
fierce promise from the musical Oliver. Is our heroine tempted, perhaps,
to change the lyrics? To sing: ''As Long As They Need Me'' as a rueful
echo of the days when everything in her life went on hold, just so she
could be there for Judy and Liza?
Think that, and you do the singer, Lorna Luft, an injustice. One that
she'd probably shrug aside like so much else that has been read into her
life as the daughter of Judy Garland and the sister of Liza Minelli.
''When you're born into Hollywood royalty -- for that's really what it
amounts to,'' she tells me, ''you soon discover that private things
about you become public property. Like I can't ever lie about my age
(she's 42) because there was so much fuss when I was born!
''And yes, people, the press, still feel that they can ask me
questions about my childhood, my family, my memories -- but I do have
choices, you know. I can either talk about it, or I can say: 'No, that's
not an area I want to discuss'.''
She is, in fact, a very warm and open person. She's tired when we
finally get to talk -- en route to her next show, in Cardiff -- but even
so, she's generous with her time and endearingly prone to make a joke
out of the distinctly unglamorous aspects of life on the road.
If she was back in the States, where she toured in Guys and Dolls
playing Miss Adelaide to dizzy acclaim, then the to-ing and fro-ing
between venues would be a relatively painless process of
airport-hopping. Over here, distances are shorter but the journeys, by
train or tour bus often end up longer.
''It's incredibly debilitating. The only way to combat it is to keep
yourself in really good shape. I'm a bit of a nut about this! After a
show, everyone's piling into the fish and chip shop . . . and I'm
sitting there with my flask of good home-made soup.''
Even in something as seemingly minor as this, you get a glimpse of the
the commonsense disciplines that have seen Lorna Luft through personal
challenges and disappointments, to where she is right now: celebrating
25 years in showbusiness and contemplating a bright new future with
29-year-old fiance Colin Freeman and her children Jesse and Vanessa.
It's true that she hasn't become a big, big star. Say ''Judy'' or
''Liza'' and chances are folk will know who you mean. But ''Lorna'' --
even ''Lorna Luft'' -- and a frequent response is: ''Who?'' Now, as
anyone who has seen her on stage will know, Luft has talent. She's not a
sound-alike clone of either her mother or her sister, nor is she a
poor-voiced relation seeking to cash in on the family's fame. So why
isn't she a household name in her own right?
Probably because she channelled her energies into other priorities,
with looking after her family coming top of the list. She's very clear
about how much her children mean to her. Married at 21 to Jake Hooker
(then a member of The Arrows pop group) Lorna ''always wanted children
very much''. What she didn't much want -- or envisage -- was the single
parenthood that came with the divorce.
To someone on the outside it looks as if Lorna's real career has been
as the support act in other people's dramas. Starting off in childhood
with her mother, then in later years with her sister -- both had
devastating problems with alcohol and drug abuse -- she graduated into
being the mainstay in her own domestic set-up.
You will sniff in vain, however, for any traces of burning martyr in
her conversation. ''I can't abide people moaning. All this 'poor me,
poor me' stuff. Look -- engage the brain. Get off your ass, do whatever
it is. There's nobody to blame but yourself if you don't.''
It's a no-nonsense approach from a woman who has witnessed mayhem at
close quarters. A counselling programme some years back gave her
valuable insights into the hidden penalties for caring for someone with
drug or alcohol dependency. She realised she'd been carrying other
peoples problems as if they were her own, and all at the expense of her
own life.
Since then she's shifted her own needs further up the list of
priorities. Chances are, that if Lorna met Oliver!'s Nancy face-to-face,
she'd tell her to change her tune and get a life! Or maybe she'd let her
leave the tune alone -- it is, after all, a good one and Lorna Luft
knows how to sing it really well.
* Lorna Luft is currently touring in The Magical World of the
Musicals. The show is in Aberdeen's Capital Theatre tonight , Dundee's
Caird Hall tomorrow, Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall on May 2, and
Edinburgh's Festival Theatre on May 20.

SALES of PEPs fell by 9% to #3400m in the last tax year compared with
1993/94, while unit trusts maintained their weak trend last month, when
net retail sales were #316m, less than a third of the March 1994 figure.
There was less of a surge in PEP sales in the weeks leading up to the
end of the tax year than previously but those in the final quarter of
the tax year were only half those in the comparable period in 1994.
''Market performance has undoubtedly had a dampening effect on demand,
with many people uncertain whether to invest or keep their money on
deposit. The recent upturn shows the danger of holding too much cash,''
commented Philip Warland, director general of the Asociation of Unit
Trusts and Investment Funds.
PEPs dominate sales of unit trusts and their net sales in 1994/95 at
#3400m were down 9%. The industry is pinning its hopes on the new
corporate bond PEPs due to appear in the summer to revitalise the
market.
The share of unit trusts sold by independent financial advisers in
March fell from 42% a year ago to 19%, while those sold through direct
sales forces and tied agents rose from 39% to 55%.

Washington, Tuesday
A MAN has been charged with conspiring with a suspect in the Oklahoma
bombing to build explosives in Michigan.
James Nichols, one of two brothers already held as a material witness
to the Oklahoma bombing, has been charged with building explosive
devices in the state. Timothy McVeigh, who was arrested and charged the
explosion, was named as a co-conspirator.
Meanwhile, the FBI has issued a revised photo-fit picture of the
second of two men who rented the Ryder truck used in the bombing, known
as John Doe number 2.
He is said to be armed and extremely dangerous. He is wanted not only
for his part in the bombing, but because he may strike again.
Police sources said they had found traces of ammonia nitrate on
McVeigh's clothing and car. That was the substance used in the bomb,
which was mixed with fuel oil and weighed two-and-a-half tons.
A number of witnesses have identified McVeigh as a man they saw in
front of the federal building just before the explosion.
He is reported to be refusing to speak to police, save to claim that
he is a political prisoner. He will give only his name, rank and army
number, the information prisoners-of-war are permitted to give their
captors.
James Nichols owns a farm in Michigan, and was arrested there on
Friday. Presumably his brother Terry Nichols, who was arrested in
Kansas, will face the same charge.
The FBI is looking for another four or five prime suspects, and
seeking to interview up to 100 other people with some connection to
McVeigh.
A final piece of information to emerge from the investigation is that
police suspect that the conspirators set off a test explosion on
February 21 in the Arizona desert. McVeigh was living there at the time.
Meanwhile, in the sixth day of the rescue operation, the city coroner
said the number of missing in the bombing was rising from previous
estimates of 150, and could exceed 200.
Ray Blakeney said families were continuing to report missing
relatives.
At the destroyed federal office building, rescue workers clawing their
way stone by stone towards ''the pit'', the area of greatest
devastation, were told to expect to find about 100 bodies.
Officials say 86 bodies have been recovered, 13 of them children, and
72 have been identified.

With legal aid costs threatening to spiral out of control, Mike Dailly
examines the case for reforming the system. Some solicitors, however,
have reservations about a review, with suspicions that the motive is
cost-cutting at the expense of justice
EARLIER this year the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, set
the scene for legal aid reform on both sides of the Border. His message
was simple: ''The legal aid system as it exists today is not living up
to the demands being placed upon it. There must be change.''
Proposals to contract legal aid services out to individual firms and
advice agencies were quickly shot down in Scotland as an attempt to
provide cheap justice. Yet why should anyone assume the current legal
aid system is the best way to achieve access to justice?
The Scottish Office is known to be considering similar proposals to
those expected in an English green paper out next month. So, does
Scottish justice really have anything to fear?
The Scottish Association of Law Centres (SALC) thinks not. Derek
O'Carroll, secretary of SALC, explains: ''In Scotland, provision of
legal advice is patchy and unplanned, and it is often a matter of sheer
chance whether an individual may have effective access to sources of
legal expertise.
''SALC believes that legal aid funds should not be restricted simply
to solicitors. They could be more effectively and efficiently used to
fund organisations such as law centres, advice agencies and franchised
legal practices in many areas.''
O'Carroll thinks many solicitors make the fundamental mistake of
viewing the existing system as sacrosanct. He says: ''The current legal
aid system is solicitor-led and not client-led -- it is the solicitor
who has total control over who has access to legal aid and for what
subjects.
''It is often a lottery whether the citizen can get access to justice
at all. What we want is a system which is consumer led, where effective
advice and representation is made available on the basis of need and
right, not greed and might.''
These strong words find favour with Dr Richard Scott, the
newly-appointed chief executive of the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB).
Scott believes clients should be able to go to the best source of advice
appropriate to their particular problem.
''At the moment you can only get legal advice and assistance through a
solicitor. It may well be that we can achieve better value for money
with something other than solicitors giving advice and assistance,'' he
explains.
Scott does not shy away from the suggestion that non-traditional
sources of legal advice could play an important role within a new legal
aid scheme: ''If you're asking me whether the Scottish legal aid system
should be funding law centres and advice agencies -- what the Lord
Chancellor is proposing for England and Wales -- then yes, I'm in favour
of that.
''I believe there should be a first level, or tier, of legal advice
and assistance provided through advice agencies and law centres.
''There will always be an important role for solicitors where
court-based solutions are necessary; but very often people who go to see
a solicitor will have problems that have very little legal content, or
have difficulties that can be better dealt with elsewhere.''
Such reforms worry the legal profession. On the face of it there is
much to suggest that the Government is simply on a cost-cutting
exercise. As Kenneth Ross, president of the Law Society of Scotland,
says: ''What are these proposals meant to achieve? Are they about less
money going into this area or a more effective delivery of service? If
the latter, then there is no evidence that service delivered by
solicitors is not efficient.
''Our perception is that there are solicitors in Scotland who are
prepared to give advice and assistance on all areas of law.''
A particular concern of civil court practitioners in Scotland would be
the introduction of a capped civil legal aid budget. Glasgow solicitor
Margaret Scanlan thinks the proposal is an English solution to an
English problem.
''The average cost of a civil case in Scotland is #850 -- in England
it's #2700, because English rates for legal aid work are higher, and
they use barristers far more than we use advocates. In Scotland, most of
the work on civil legal aid is done in the sheriff court, which is by
far the most economic forum.''
Civil practitioners also point to the fact that eligibility rates for
civil legal aid are already desperately tight. Last month, BBC Radio
Scotland's Lawful Business interviewed a battered wife who had obtained
a court order to exclude her violent partner from the family home.
With an income of about #74 per week, Mrs M was expected to pay a
legal aid contribution of #1147. She was lucky -- an anonymous charity
donation after the show helped to ease the financial burden. What next;
National Lottery justice?
Of course, this is only half the story. True, Lord Mackay and the
Scottish Office want to curb a growing legal aid budget; but proposals
go deeper than this. As Lord Mackay stated earlier this year: ''Under
the present legal aid scheme, once initial eligibility on financial and
merit grounds is established, there is virtually open-ended access to
funding.''
As we have seen, open-ended access to funding leads to abuse of legal
aid. Is it any wonder that a few criminal practitioners really do become
criminal practitioners? The current legal aid system simply invites a
solicitor to incur needless expenditure and milk fees. Lord Mackay is
right -- there is no incentive for solicitors to be prudent with the
public purse.
What then of his proposals for reform? SLAB chief executive Dr Richard
Scott explains: ''Franchising south of the Border means certain legal
firms, on an experimental basis, must meet transaction criteria: for
example, they will have to keep various client records. Once franchised,
certain benefits are given to the firm in the way of turnaround times
and payments.
''I think franchising is a good first step, but there are other
proposals which address the whole question of how legal aid should be
delivered. For example, you could have a contract with a legal firm to
do all of the summary cause work in Paisley, on the basis of a block
fee.
''The key point is that the Scottish Legal Aid Board wants to work
constructively with the legal profession to ensure the best value for
money for legal services.''
A set fee for a set amount of work sounds reasonable enough, but even
franchising -- the first stage of reform in England -- has met with
opposition. According to a spokesman for the English Law Society, only
one tenth of the firms doing legal aid in England have taken on
franchises.
The spokesman said: ''The English Law Society is not hostile to the
concept of franchising in the sense that it is a way to identify
high-quality service, while relieving the need for detailed scrutiny by
the Legal Aid Board. However, we would be strongly opposed to any
restriction that meant only franchised firms could do legal aid work.''
The Law Society of Scotland takes a similar stance. The president,
Kenneth Ross, says: ''The Law Society is very wary of anything that
restricts the individual's choice to select legal advisers.''
However, a research report by Professor Alan Paterson, of Strathclyde
University, tells a different story. The report, published last June,
stated: ''Legal aid outlets are highly concentrated, with 20% of them
being responsible for between 60% (civil) and 75% of the work
(criminal). This indicates that there are de facto legal aid
specialists, particularly in the criminal field.''
So, if clients already choose a select number of firms, would
exclusive franchising really be such a big step in Scotland's central
belt?
In principle, then, there is much to commend the review of the
Scottish legal aid system. However, change must not be dictated and
governed by an agenda tailored for England's legal system.
Reassuringly, this view is shared by SLAB's chief executive. Dr Scott
said: ''While change is required, I agree that it is important that
steps taken in Scotland do not blindly reflect what happens down
south.''
If change does take place and savings are made, then Lord Mackay must
keep to his word and increase eligibility rates for civil legal aid.
That is one English reform no-one could complain about.
* A debate on the future of Scottish legal aid will take place in
Glasgow on May 13. Speakers will include the chief executive of SLAB and
senior figures from the legal profession. Inquiries to the Scottish
Legal Action Group, 15 William Street, Dundee, DD1 2ND (Tel: 01382
201003).

Kennedy Wilson tells how shameful injustice for an early birth-control
advocate ironically gave a huge boost to her campaign
TODAY, when family planning is a matter of course, the condom is an
icon of Aids-aware youth, sexologists appear on every chat show and
stemming world population is on the minds of political leaders, a court
case now 75 years old reminds us how controversial and provocative the
subject of birth control once was.
Dr Halliday Sutherland was a Roman Catholic, and, like his church, he
condemned birth control and Marie Stopes, founder of the Society for
Constructive Birth Control. Her book Married Love was published in 1918
and sold more than 1,000,000 copies, being translated into 13 languages.
She went on to open the first free birth-control clinic in the British
Empire.
Stopes was a distinguished zoologist and paleontologist. She was an
early feminist and when she set up home with her first husband decided
to retain her maiden name -- a practice that is only now relatively
common. Her Scottish mother studied literature and philosophy at
Edinburgh, where she pioneered courses for women. Stopes has been called
''one of the most remarkable women of the twentieth century''.
In his own book, Dr Sutherland accused Stopes of ''exploiting the
poor'' whom he considered to be ''the natural victims of those who seek
to make experiment on their fellows''. He also wrote of Stopes's
''monstrous campaign of birth control'' and made snide references to her
doctorate in German philosophy which played into the hands of post-war
anti-German sentiment.
Stopes had little alternative but to sue for libel. The case was heard
before the Lord Chief Justice of England, Baron Hewart. Sir Patrick
Hastings, one of the most brilliant barristers of the day, acted as Dr
Stopes's counsel.
''Since the plaintiff and defendant invited equally eminent members of
the medical profession with opposing views to testify, the outcome
depended largely on the summing-up of the judge,'' writes June Rose in
Marie Stopes and the Sexual Revolution. ''The case . . . rested on the
views of moralists and medical men.''
During cross examination it became clear that the libel case was
really an attack on everything that Marie Stopes stood for. The jury, of
course, was all male.
Rose writes: ''In the trial, whenever the defence tried to demonstrate
that Marie Stopes's thinking about sex and contraception threatened the
young, the family, the life and morals of the nation, Lord Hewart seemed
to be endorsing their accusations. On one occasion he called birth
control 'copulation without consequences'. Sometimes it seemed that the
case was more concerned with trying Stopes for obscenity than Stopes
trying to redress a libel.''
At the end of the court case the jury agreed that the words complained
of by Dr Stopes were defamatory. However, to the Lord Chief Justice's
question, ''Were they (the words) true in substance and fact?'', the
jury also answered ''Yes''. ''Were they fair comment?'' The jury
answered ''No''.
At the end, the jury awarded Stopes #100 damages. However, the Lord
Chief Justice ruled that although the jury had awarded damages, their
answer to the ''true in substance and fact'' question meant that Dr
Sutherland, Doctor of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, had won
the action.
In an extraordinary turn of events the judge decided that in the light
of the success of Stopes's best-selling books, Married Love and Wise
Parenthood, the author must have some #80,000 at her disposal. Stopes
had previously admitted that money raised from her books went towards
her birth-control campaign. Therefore, the judge decided to present her
with a bill of many thousands of pounds. Stopes had no option but to
appeal.
Hewart's biographer said that he was a man who ''had a tendency to
take sides in cases that came before him''. When the case was one which
involved complex issues of philosophy and morality, such taking of sides
became particularly worrisome.
The Stopes case gave the birth-control campaign added fuel. In its
aftermath Dr Stopes travelled the country spreading her gospel, speaking
in public halls and to medical students. One of the central tenets of
her creed was that ''birth-control advice should be available at welfare
centres in cities and towns'' throughout Britain.
''The Sutherland plot to discredit her work in its infancy proved a
boomerang. The legal actions were only serving to focus public attention
on the vacuum which existed in the social services of the day and gain
support for her birth-control clinics,'' says Keith Bryant, one of
Stopes's biographers.
By the time the appeal rolled round in the summer of 1923 Marie Stopes
was already the victim of increasing hate mail, much of it anonymous. So
severe and orchestrated was this campaign that the appeal judge
denounced it from the Bench.
On appeal, Marie Stopes won and was awarded the costs of the appeal
plus half the costs of the original case. Stopes's victory centred on
the confusion caused by the introduction in the first trial of the
questions submitted to the jury by the Lord Chief Justice.
It was agreed that the questions were not happily framed and that the
jury had not appreciated that their affirmative answer to the question
''were (the words complained of) true?'' made a nonsense of the negative
answer to the subsequent question ''were they fair comment?''.
Halliday Sutherland was not to be defeated and was determined to take
the matter to the highest court in the land, the House of Lords. Stopes
devoted her whole energy to preparing the Lords' appeal case. According
to Bryant: ''Since she had grounded herself in the basic legal
principles of libel she had grown more and more absorbed in the
fascination of the rules and means by which legal warfare is
conducted.''
The hearing was set for the House of Lords in October 1924 and was
heard before the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Finlay; Lord Shaw of
Dunfermline; Lord Wrenbury; and Lord Carson. Unbelievably as it may
seem, Stopes lost (three to one). The dissenting Lord Wrenbury said:
''The learned Lord Chief Justice did not properly direct the jury to
discriminate between fact and opinion.'' George Bernard Shaw, a friend
of Stopes, wrote to her, ''the decision is scandalous''.
Stopes had awarded against her the costs of all three cases in what
seems today to be a clear case of a jury being misdirected. In the end,
she had to pay the defendants' costs and repay the damages and costs
paid to her under the appeal court ruling.
According to another observer, Muriel Box: ''Stopes undoubtedly
achieved greater and far wider success in spreading her ideas by losing
the case than she would have done by winning it.'' The court case made
Stopes more famous than ever, so much so that, irony heaped upon irony,
she was commissioned to write a book called Roman Catholic Methods of
Birth Control.

Encouraging pointers to future inflation have come from the latest
Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey from the CBI in England.
Despite rising input costs, firms surveyed expect price increases to
moderate in coming months, with the balance of firms expecting to post
higher prices less those seeing price falls down from 33% in January to
18%. This follows an acceleration in domestic price rises over the past
four months to the highest levels for five years. Nevertheless
manufacturers have not actually managed to achieve the price rises they
had been hoping for.
Howard Davies, CBI director-general and future deputy Governor of the
Bank of England, commented: ''Prices have risen more quickly over the
past four months. But the picture varies from sector to sector and
manufacturers either face strong cost pressures due to rising imported
raw material prices or try to restore depleted margins.
''There are some signs that price rises may have passed their peak as
expectations of further increases for the next four months have eased.''
Unit costs are continuing to rise at the highest rate for four years
and likely to continue. Mr Davies pointed out that the 0%-1% rate of
increase was low by UK standards but compared with a 6% decline in
Germany.
Overall business confidence improved further, as it has done for the
tenth successive survey, though the increase was less marked than in
January.
The CBI view on interest rates is that there is no reason for an
increase at the moment, unless the pound declines further. It has now
reached the point at which any advantage of additional weakening would
be outweighed by the disadvantages, according to the organisation. It
does believe base rates will be higher before the end of the year.
Overall growth in manufacturing has slowed over the past four months,
though not as much as expected in the January survey.

SCOTTISH industry is working at its fullest capacity for the last 30
years and the mood of confidence remains strong, the Scottish CBI said,
commenting on its latest quarterly survey of industrial trends.
Investment in plant and machinery continues at a high level and most
Scottish companies expect a further rise in orders over the next four
months, but the CBI warned that they face a tough time in comptetive
export markets.
John Ward, the Scottish chairman of the CBI, said the latest survey of
about 150 firms, conducted in late March and early April, reflected
''continued confidence in the future.''
The percentage of firms working below capacity fell sharply to 28% in
the first quarter of this year from 57% in the last three months of
1994.
''That's the lowest level for 30 years that we have seen in the
survey,'' Mr Ward said.
The squeeze on production capacity was matched by a steep rise in the
number of firms planning new investment to expand output to 42% from 23%
in the previous quarter.
The CBI said Scottish companies were looking for a further increase in
orders in the months ahead.
''The volume of new orders is hugely optimistic,'' Mr Ward said, but
he noted that Scottish companies expected fewer of these to come from
export markets.
''Competition is getting stronger,'' Mr Ward said. ''There is a lot of
competition from south east Asia and perhaps some of the currency
instability which we have been reading about recently has made a number
of companies concerned.''
Competition in export markets had also prevented Scottish firms from
raising prices as much as they had hoped, despite the rising cost of
commodity inputs such as paper, board, plastics and steel, he said.
Mr Ward said the CBI did not read too much importance into survey
returns that showed Scottish companies planned to reduce their workforce
over the next four months after unexpectedly taking on more workers
during the first quarter.
The two figures basically cancelled each other out, he concluded.

JUDGES are often accused of sitting on their bahookies and dishing out
punishment without ever knowing anything about the real world.
Not so Sheriff Charles Palmer on the Dunfermline bench, survivor of
two heart attacks, who next month is getting on his bike. Aged 49, he's
due to be the first triple heart by-pass patient, never mind judge, to
cycle from Land's End to John o' Groats.
The point of his 19-day exercise is to raise #50,000 for the British
Heart Foundation in Scotland.
Palmer the patient, suffered his first massive heart attack in April
1991, fortunately for him, close to the Western General in Edinburgh.
Number two came in March 1992, followed by the by-pass operation,
after which he received BHF-supported rehabilitation at the Astley
Ainslie Hospital.
''Basically, I wanted to put something back into the system, having
got so much out of it, and maybe encourage others who have been through
the same experience,'' he said.
''My first heart attack was bad. I was lucky. I got to hospital
quickly and they pumped me with clot-busting drugs. Without them, I
would not be here.''
Palmer, the Inverness schoolboy and son of an estate factor, arrived
at the law late, having done stints as a bank clerk and policeman before
going to university in Edinburgh.
Reasonably fit and active, he may have fallen victim to a family
history of heart disease, but within four months of his by-pass
operation, he was 12,000ft up on Mont Blanc.
As a BHF fund-raiser and publicist, Palmer has gone into top gear.
Richard Branson, Jimmy Savile, and Lord Forte have helped him, and
Graeme Souness and Finlay Calder are due to join him at some stage
during his epic trip.
He will be flagged off in Dunfermline by actor Tony Roper, better
known as Rab C Nesbitt's sidekick, Jamesie Cotter.
Contributions have flooded in from most of his colleagues, advocates
and High Court judges. He is appealing for a fiver a head from every
Scottish solicitor and has also written to every judge in England.
He hopes some of the inmates in prisons en route might also help since
coronary heart disease makes no distinction between beaks and lags, QCs
or Rab Cs.
''It's the type of condition that attacks everyone. It is also a good
cause, so I shouldn't be turning down an honest offer from anybody,'' he
added. Cheques should sent payable to the BHF, care of Sheriff C W
Palmer, Dunfermline Sheriff Court, 1/6 Carnegie Drive, Dunfermline.
Beak on a bike: Sheriff C W Palmer ready for the road
Last word in surrealism
IN the 70th anniversary of the publication of The Trial by Franz
Kafka, it is pleasing to hear his surrealistic visions resurfacing at
Airdrie Sheriff Court. At the end of a stressful Mental Health Act
detention hearing, a hypomanic but highly articulate woman described her
position as ''like the sword of Damocles hanging over me . . . it's
Kafkaesque''. Granting the order, temporary sheriff Rosie Morrison
sugared the pill with sympathy: ''It must be just like one of Kafka's
plays.'' But the last word was with the woman as she was led away:
''Kafka didn't write any plays!''
Sunny side up
NICE to see hope springing eternal, even out of what the Scottish
Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal described as the worst case it had to
consider for many years. Gordon and Maria Thomson have been struck off
and are appealing against the decision, but the show goes on at Gordon
Thomson and Co in Sighthill, Edinburgh. A letter to clients soon
afterwards features a Mr Smiley logo, refers to the ''exciting press
interest in our firm'', but adds that what has been said has no effect
on it. It will continue to provide ''an excellent service to our clients
who we consider to be friends of our firm''.
Presidential law
SENSIBLE lot the French. They don't use the law as a springboard for
politics in the same way that we do. Three law graduates among the
original 12 presidential candidates were eliminated in the first ballot.
Which is just as well, in the opinion of Diable's Avocat, because one of
them was Jean-Marie Le Pen, of the Be Nasty to Foreigners' Party. The
others were Jean-Francois Hory (radical right) and Brice Lalonde
(ecology). Instead, France tends to trawl for future politicos from its
own Ecole National d'Administration. Its next president (Lionel Jospin
or Jacques Chirac) will be an ENA graduate, as was fellow candidate
Philippe de Villiers who described it as a place ''where you go in
knowing 1200 words and leave knowing 200''.

ABERDEEN-based Ramco Energy's decision to stake a claim in Azerbaijan
five years ago -- when most oil majors were targeting Russia and Siberia
-- allowed it to achieve record pre-tax profits last year.
Ramco's involvement in the consortium which signed a landmark
production-sharing contract in September with the State Oil Company of
the Azerbaijan Republic -- relating to reserves estimated at 4000
million barrels -- led to an initial receipt of $5m (#3.2m) in December.
This came from US company Pennzoil, which is meeting Ramco's past and
ongoing costs in the region, in return for the Aberdeen company having
brought it into the consortium.
Ramco's pre-tax profits, which were 44% ahead of its previous best of
#1.13m recorded in 1990, were more than five times greater than last
year at #1.62m. Turnover was up 58% at #7.57m.
The company doubled its single final dividend to 1p.
Ramco's results announcement was well received by the City. The
company's shares, which are quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market,
put on 12p to 336p.
The Aberdeen company changed its name from Ramco Oil Services last
June to reflect its ''transformation from a small oil services company
into one of the UK's largest independent oil and gas companies in
reserve terms''.
On the oil services side, currently the main generator of cash for the
business, Ramco said its Aberdeen-based tubular services operations had
been ''moderately successful'', although they had to cope with
relocation.
Its Hartlepool-based pipeline services business returned to profit.
Group financial director Steven Bertram believed Ramco's 2.08% stake
in the 10-strong consortium in Azerbaijan would probably put it among
the top 10 UK independents, with reserves of more than 83 million
barrels.
BP and Amoco have respective interests in the Azeri, Chirag and deep
water Gunashli oil fields in the Caspian Sea -- which are the subject of
the production-sharing contract -- of 17.2% and 17.1%. The contract was
ratified by the Azerbaijani Parliament in December.
If early production proves feasible, oil could be flowing to the
international market by the end of next year, with Ramco receiving a
cash flow from production as early as 1997.
The Aberdeen-based company, which will receive another payment of
$2.5m from Pennzoil in December and a further $3m a year later, is
looking to link up with a major player to exploit the Muradhanli
contract area in onshore Azerbaijan.
Ramco described 1994 as the most dramatic 12 months in its 18-year
history.
Executive chairman Steve Remp said: ''As a result of the political,
social and economic difficulties in Russia, many international oil
companies have refocused their attention on the Caspian and on
Azerbaijan in particular.''
He said Ramco, with its strong position in the state, had identified
several other major oil and gas development opportunities which might
attract partners.

SCOTTISH oil-related companies were yesterday urged to continue to
make a major effort to spread their international wings, particularly in
countries like China which could soon be a major rival.
Announcing a 20% increase in the Wood Group turnover to #291m last
year but a rise in profits of just 7.3% to #20.5m, Sir Ian Wood, head of
the UK's largest indigenous energy industry service company, said that
although profit margins were down the culture change in the past three
or four years had made most North Sea service companies sharper and more
efficient.
He said one reason for the reduced margins could be attributed to the
fact that the company was still investing in improved work methods, in
training, and in a whole range of activities in improving their
performance.
''The good news from the international point of view is that we now do
not just have the technology but we have the work methods, work
practices and partnering and alliance concepts which can very
successfully be exported.''
He said exports and overseas activities accounted for one-third of the
Wood Group's business, an increase by 10 fold over the past five years.
Sir Ian, who recently stood down as chairman of Grampian Enterprise,
said that for several years he had been urging companies in North-east
Scotland to undertake international activities and diversify. He said
his group had followed that policy to the extent that in 1994 half of
their profits were earned outside upstream oil which represented a major
change in their business.
His group is a world leader in the overhaul and repair of industrial
gas turbines which in turn had led it into a number of other activities
in the power generation industry.
''The North Sea has totally changed in the last five years,'' he said.
''There has been a real culture change. We have taken a huge step ahead
which has been very positive and that provides a springboard for
international opportunities.
''We are still nowhere near as far on as we should be in Scottish
terms on moving internationally but we are making big strides.
Sir Ian said that privatisation in South American countries like
Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia was creating an opportunity
for ''late starters'' because there were new customers to deal with.
He said the former Soviet Union was by far the largest opportunity
internationally in the next five to 10 years but although ''clearly not
for the faint hearted'' any service company with serious intentions
should be attempting to make inroads.
He said China also provided major potential as a market but China
could also soon become a major competitor.
''They are very good at taking oil technology and adapting it and
increasingly over the next five to 10 years we are going to see China
appearing as a competitor to the contracting and supply companies.
''I think we must be aware that the whole of South-east Asia is very
capable of being our major competitor in the future.''

McCARTHY &amp; STONE chairman John McCarthy was basking yesterday in the
first half-year profit for five years for the sheltered home builder,
writes ANDREW WILSON.
Not only is the company in better fettle than since 1989 but it is in
the happy position of being by far the most dominant force in the sector
with a 78% share of the with-warden homes and where the cost of entry
for rivals is exceptionally high for the building industry.
In the half year to February, there was a swing round from losses of
#400,000 which were struck after the inclusion of a #1.5m contribution
from an asset now sold off into a #1.3m profit. That was on turnover
slightly down to #25.1m with the number of units sold almost unchanged
at 320 but with the average price some #1500 lower at #63,000.
That reflected a swing back to building 75% of apartments as
single-bedded accommodation. The construction cost of such units is
about 30% below that of a two-bedroom flat.
Current trading is satisfactory in Scotland and buoyant in the south
of England but more difficult further north.
The 33-unit development at Corstorphine, Edinburgh, has been a major
success with already 27 units effectively sold.
Gross margins have improved from 28.1% to 33% as a result in part to
lower land costs as old, expensive land has been worked through, and a
#3100 reduction in average unit building costs.
As McCarthy needs about 18 months of likely sales on its books, it
ended the period witha total of 1741 units either completed or under
construction. This is totally alien to the average house constructor
which rarely builds more than two months ahead and so is a deterent to
the emergence of new competitors who would have to tie up large amounts
of capital.
Preference dividend arrears are being paid off and there will be a
final dividend on the Ordinary shares of perhaps 1p on earnings of
about5.5p based on pre-tax profits ofjust over #7m.
At 59p, 1p above the rights price, the shares sell at 11 times likely
earnings while yielding a possible 2.1%.

DOMESTIC demand remains sluggish with consumer confidence still
leaving much to be desired at least if you are a retailer.
Unseasonally mild weather last autumn coupled with poor consumer
demand for much of the winter months upset most retailers and Sears was
no exception. Its British Shoe Corporation, (BSC) which includes Hush
Puppies, Shoe Express and Dolcis was left with too much stock, a
situation which is slowly being remedied. However the business increased
its profits by 16% to #38.1m. Sales grew by 8.7% on an underlying basis.
Overall the group's annual profits were in line with City expectations
at #153.8m pre-tax compared with #138.3m previously. Sales from
continuing operations rose by 6.8% to #2143m. The strength of the
balance sheet with year-end net cash of #172.2m coupled with the growth
in profits led the Sears board to recommend an 8.2% increase in the
final dividend to 2.9p which, together with the interim dividend gives a
total of 3.95p per share, an increase of 7.3% for the year as a whole.
The legacy of Olympus Sports' expensive over expansion in the 1980s
lives on. The business made a #2m loss last year. The out-of-town
Olympus Sportsworlds, of which there are currently 25, which offer a
comprehensive range of equipment and clothing for amateur and
professional alike are trading well with sales growth ahead of the high
street outlets.
Around 40 of the high street stores are to close including a few
unidentified outlets in Scotland. The remaining 100 stores in town are
to revert back to basics featuring merchandise for both sexes who have a
general interest in sport. Up until fairly recently Olympus had been too
reliant on the young male fashion trainer market which has collapsed.
On the positive side there was a healthy improvement in the
performance of the Adams childrenswear business with a sales and profit
decline in the first half halted in the second. The women's fashion
chains all traded well with like-for-like sales growth of 7.7%. Profits
jumped 77% to #22.9m.
Selfridges, the group's flagship department store in London's Oxford
Street, is being made into a much more attractive store in terms of both
fittings, layout and merchandise. This is benefiting both sales and
profits. In the current year, a new Kids Universe featuring a cafe,
toys, clothing and shoes and new young fashion department will open
which should boost trading.
As a group Sears is busy improving the structure of the business with
an ongoing refurbishment programme of all its fascias. By the end of the
current financial year 40% of its total selling space will have been
revamped. Where this has already occurred there have been encouraging
uplifts in sales. In Glasgow, there are ''new'' Warehouse, Dolcis, Adams
and Miss Selfridge outlets.
A further 200 British Shoe outlets will be revamped in the current
year. The business is now split into Shoe Express catering for the
cheaper end of the market, Hush Puppies competing head to head with
Clarke's and Dolcis in the middle ground.
The Freemans home shopping business, the UK's second biggest, achieved
what was described as a satisfactory improvement in profits to #41.2m.
Underlying profit growth was 13% stripping out the closure costs of the
Dutch business.
The UK home shopping market is a mature one but in recent years
targeted specialist catalogues for example for older women, young
fashions have brought some vigour back into the market. Sears is testing
the sale of merchandise from its Wallis collection within the Freemans
catalogue which if successful could lead to merchandise from other
multiples such as Warehouse being included. It has also launched a
direct service cutting out agents although they are seen as the
cornerstone of the business going forward.
Commenting on the outlook, chief executive Liam Strong says that
trading remains reasonably tight because there is not too much consumer
confidence and so this year is expected to be another one of
consolidation.
Sears has often suffered from the perception that it has too many
mature businesses. Retail analysts such as those at brokers Smith New
Court believe that the group lacks a high quality earnings mix and as
such it sees little scope for improvement in the share price which
yesterday gained 1[1/2]p to 104[1/2]p  for a yield of 4.7%.

MUCH stronger than expected growth in gross domestic product in the
first quarter has increased the pressures on the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of England,
Eddie George, to agree another increase in base rates when they meet on
May 5, the day after the local elections in England and Wales.
The economy, which was boosted by the success of the National Lottery,
grew by 0.8% in the first three months, according to provisional
estimates by the Central Statistical Office. This was the same rate as
in the final quarter of last year. So there has been no further slowdown
in the pace of economic activity, though its composition has altered.
Quarterly growth was hectic in the first half of last year with rates
of 1.1% to 1.4%. It then tailed off to 0.9% in the third quarter.
The year-on-year growth rate has fallen back from 4.2% at the end of
last year to 3.9%. But it is clear from both the year-on-year figures
and the latest quarterly rate that the economy is still growing at well
above its long-term trend rate of 2.25%.
The Bank of England has attached great weight to the overall GDP
figures in arguing for changes in monetary policy, and it seems likely
that it will be doing so again at the end of next week.
Weak industrial production and retail sales figures so far this year
had encouraged expectations of a significant slowdown in quarterly
growth. City projections had been mainly clustered around 0.5% to 0.6%.
If oil and gas extraction is excluded, the growth rate was also 0.8%.
The figures, published yesterday, represent the CSO's first stab at
estimating first-quarter GDP. There is little detail available except
that the service sector has performed very strongly.
Services are estimated to have increased output by 1% in the quarter,
the strongest since the second quarter of last year and, within the
sector, distribution, hotels and catering, and repairs, which include
retail sales, produced 0.8% more.
The CSO has assumed broadly flat industrial production, following a
slowdown in the growth rate in the previous two quarters. This means
that nearly all the growth came from services.
James Capel's Adam Cole said, ''Clearly consumer spending in the first
quarter of the this year was far stronger than the retail sales figures
suggest -- as was the case in the fourth quarter of last year -- because
of spending on services.''
The CSO estimates that the National Lottery added 0.1% to the
quarterly growth rate, and consumers also seemed to be spending money on
the likes of holidays and dining out which are not included in the
retail sales figures.
After the strength of the first quarter Cole is sticking to his
forecast of 4% growth for the year as a whole. Exports will have
received a boost from the fall in the exchange rate, most of which
occurred in March, and should promote stronger growth in manufacturing.
That much is clear from the latest CBI industrial trends survey, which
provided a mixed bag of signals on the economy. The activity indicators
were soft, but export orders were exceptionally strong.
There was some encouragement from the decline in manufacturers' price
expectations, but the Bank of England will be anxious about the high
levels of capacity utilisation. This is resulting in a much need pickup
in investment intentions, which will add to activity levels.
The GDP figures and the CBI survey overshadowed an encouraging set of
non-EU trade figures for March, showing a decline in the monthly deficit
from #371m to #263m. Figures for trade with Europe, which are released
later, will be more significant.
A May 5 rate rise might well have been sparked off by the latest GDP
figures on their own. Given the 5% drop in sterling this year there are
few doubts left. Indeed the pound could become an endangered species if
the authorities decided to wait.

Washington, Tuesday -- Policymakers from major nations sought ways to
persuade financial markets that they can work together to halt a
head-long decline in the dollar, but analysts predicted they would avoid
strong action.
Just before the afternoon meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers
and central bankers, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura met to discuss the soaring yen and
falling dollar.
A Japanese official said the two agreed at the 45-minute session that
they shared a common concern about what was happening in currency
markets and they agreed that ''significant and fruitful'' discussions
were in order.
Analysts, however, were betting that the policymakers from the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, and Canada, meeting to
consider ways to work together for the good of the world economy, would
do little more than pay lip service to increased co-operation.
President Bill Clinton admitted that there was little that the United
States and its allies can do in the short run to turn around a dollar
that has fallen close to 20% against the Japanese yen since the start of
the year.
''There's not much that you can do,'' he told the Des Moines Register
newspaper. ''The size of the markets will overwhelm government
interventions.''
But analysts said the problem went deeper than that. G-7 nations seem
unable to agree among themselves on what's behind the dollar's fall and
what should be done to stop it.
Washington blames Japan and its huge trade surplus -- a charge
repeated by Clinton on Tuesday. Germany and, to a lesser extent, Japan
blame the United States and its big budget deficit.
German Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said reduction of the US
deficit was the ''most important starting point for durably overcoming
the dollar's recent weakness.'' -- Reuter

Kibeho, Tuesday
TUTSI soldiers cut off food and water supplies today to the last Hutus
besieged in Kibeho camp in south-western Rwanda, where UN human rights
workers investigated the slaughter of thousands at the weekend.
''The siege will continue even if it means going on for six months,''
an officer of the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) said outside an old
hospital compound where the Hutus were holed up.
''At the moment we feel there is no need to use force against these
people but we have enough fire power should the need arise,'' the
officer said.
The Hutus are the remnants of Kibeho camp's population, until last
week 100,000-strong, which had all but been dispersed to their old
villages by today.
A total of 250,000 Hutus were being forcibly transported home by
truck, even though many of them were being beaten and stoned by soldiers
and Tutsi civilians on their way, aid workers said.
From the nearby base of a Zambian army company in the UN peacekeeping
force, women and children were visible in the compound. Armed Hutu men
were reportedly on the building's second floor, UN officials said.
They took refuge in the hill-top compound after RPA forces opened fire
on densely-packed Hutu crowds last Saturday.
Witnesses said Hutus fired back from the building and Tutsi troops
responded by lobbing mortar bombs at the refugees and bayoneting those
who fled. Many were killed in stampedes.
The Red Cross was mediating today between the RPA surrounding Kibeho
and the last Hutus, who number in the hundreds.
The Hutus, who are ailing from lack of water and food, plus disease
and overcrowding, want free passage to refugee camps in Zaire, aid
workers said.
''There is no question of allowing them this so-called free passage,''
the RPA officer said. ''What we want is for them to come out so we can
screen the innocent people from criminals. Denying them food and water
is one way of forcing them out.''
Some 38 arms were confiscated in Kibeho, the UN said.
In Kigali, UN special envoy Shaharyar Khan denied his mission had
whitewashed the true number of Hutus slaughtered in Kibeho. He said UN
forces were powerless to stop the carnage.
''We are not deceiving anyone,'' Khan told reporters. ''We gave the
proper figures on the day. The force commander himself . . . supervised
a careful, scientific count and came out with the figure of 2000. He
consulted all people.''
On Saturday, United Nations officials initially estimated the number
of men, women and children gunned down by RPA soldiers and crushed to
death in the ensuing stampede at 8000.
Khan gave a figure of 5000 hours after Australian army medical staff
said they counted 4050 dead and 600 wounded -- and that the RPA had
stopped them from going on.
Rwanda's President, Pasteur Bizimungu, visited the camp and said only
300 had died. The 2000 figure was released after a visit to Kibeho by UN
Assistance Mission in Rwanda force commander Major-General Guy
Tousignant.--Reuter.

IT WOULD be easier if the Oklahoma City bombers had been Arabs. The
country could then have rallied together in outrage against an external
enemy and perhaps sent the Sixth Fleet into action against Libya. But
the enemy is within. The bombers are all- American crackpots, the far
fringe of an unbroken continuum that runs straight into the heart of the
nation.
The line ran in the opposite direction back in the 1960s. That was
when the anti-Vietnam War movement spread from a few principled
objectors all the way to the extremists who shot policemen and set off
bombs. There was a direct continuum from Gene McCarthy and George
McGovern to the demonstrators who chanted ''Hey, Hey, LBJ, How Many Kids
Did You Kill Today?'' to the bombers, who called themselves the Weather
Underground.
The connection was perceived, and it nearly destroyed the Democratic
Party. McGovern, a man of exceptional decency and rectitude, was blamed
for the acts of the extremists and his followers were called
''McGoverniks'', to imply that he, and they, were communists.
Newt Gingrich used the term recently, applying it to Bill Clinton. But
now the line can be seen, clearly, running from the Republican
equivalent of George McGovern, Ronald Reagan, who proclaimed that
''Government is not the solution to our problems. Government is the
problem.''
The line passes on to Newt Gingrich, who practises the politics of
vitriol, calling the President a McGovernik and abusing the Democrats as
''not normal Americans''; to wilder Republicans and to Rush Limbaugh the
talk-show host who denounce the government as an evil; to the National
Rifle Association and the Michigan Militia -- and straight on to Tim
McVeigh and the massacre of the innocents in Oklahoma City.
The far-right militia movement includes many diverse factions. Some
are paranoid against the government because of their obsession with
firearms, some hate Jews or blacks, or both, most detest banks -- and
the Federal Reserve.
The President appealed to Americans on Monday to oppose ''the rhetoric
of hate'', meaning Rush Limbaugh and all the other exponents of hate and
violence on the radio. There is a good chance that he will be heard, and
that people will realise just how dangerous, how odious, hate propaganda
is.
Take Congressman Steve Stockman, of Texas. He defeated a long-term
Democrat last November on a platform of Republican extremism, opposition
to gun-control, and a generally apocalyptic vision of the dangers
emanating from Washington.
This sympathetic figure was sent a fax announcing the Oklahoma bombing
on the morning it happened. It is possible, though not proved, that the
fax was sent before the bomb went off.
At any event, it certainly came from the far fringe, from the militia
whose members or sympathisers set the bomb. Stockman now has to explain
what is his connection to these people. So far, he has not been very
persuasive.
They evidently thought of him as one of them -- and he is a strong
supporter of Newt Gingrich. The Republicans and their apologists are
already running scared, denouncing those who suggest that there is a
connection between their version of robust polemic and committing
murder.
They say that the connection is made by hostile media. But in fact,
the extremist hate-mongers are making it themselves. Every talk-show,
every news broadcast for the past week has included spokesmen for one
extremist group or another -- and the result is likely to be a general
revulsion from them and their friends. They all disapprove of the
bombing, but assert that it was an understandable reaction to federal
tyranny.
There is still paranoia on the left. Conspiracy theories thrive
everywhere in America: Oliver Stone (who is British) makes a good living
out of movies about CIA conspiracies to murder President Kennedy or the
nefarious links between big business and television to harass innocent
teenage serial killers.
But after Oklahoma City, no-one can deny that right-wing paranoia is
the real danger to America. It cannot be isolated and expelled, because
it is an integral part of the culture. Perhaps, instead, the tide will
turn, as the President suggested, and main-line politicians will rein in
their rhetoric. In a country as heavily-armed as this one, and with so
many bomb experts, hate is the most dangerous of all commodities.

SCOTTISH National Trust, one of the UK's largest split capital
investment funds, yesterday declared its first increase in dividend for
four years.
Unveiling a 13% increase in revenue from its portfolio to #10.5m in
the six months to end-March, the Gartmore Scotland-managed trust
announced a 3.2% rise in its second interim dividend to 1.6p, making a
total of 3.15p for the year to date.
The #370m high-yielding fund, which has the unenviable target of
achieving a yield which is one-and-a-half times that on the All-Share
index, found itself in the unfortunate position of having to cut its
payout three years ago.
Peter Kennedy, managing director of Gartmore Scotland said: ''We have
now gone through that dark period and it is pleasing to announce, albeit
a small increase, in one of the three interim payouts.''
During the six months, the net asset value of Scottish National's
non-dividend capital shares declined 26% to 31.8p.
Meanwhile, Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust, which is
managed by Glasgow Investment Managers, reported a 1.6% decline in fully
diluted net asset value to 135.1p for the three months to March 31.
It increased its first interim dividend by 4.2% to 1.25p.

THE Government is in grave danger of making another very big mistake
in Scotland, if it decides to merge Scottish Nuclear with its English
counterpart and to privatise them as one company.
There is a socialist argument against this, that Governments must
avert any threat to Scottish jobs. I do not propose to concern myself
with the argument any further, because it is wrong: the only people who
can make sure Scots have jobs are Scots themselves.
But there is also a Conservative argument against it. Walter Elliot,
our best Tory Secretary of State, used to say that ''for Scotland,
nationalisation means denationalisation''. In other words, among the
main causes of the steady loss of control by Scots of their own economy
in the post-war period was the extension of control by the state, a
consciously centralising British state which nearly always sited the
headquarters of its public corporations in London.
Once every major industry was nationalised, the Scots entrepreneur
virtually vanished. To add insult to injury, the public corporations
then proceeded to run themselves inefficiently, so that not only control
was lost, but in the end the industries were lost as well.
With the turn of the tide in 1979, and the retreat of the state since,
we might have hoped for some decisive reversal of the centralising
process. For a long time, however, little happened.
Leaving aside the special case of the sale of council houses, there
were no specifically Scottish privatisations till after 1987, despite
the opportunities.
The Trustee Savings Bank, in its old form actually the biggest
Scottish bank, was sold off as part of a large and far from dynamic
financial institution based in London. Ravenscraig, which might have
survived as some kind of independent company, was always doomed inside
the monolith of the British Steel Corporation. Britoil set up in
Glasgow, but then left. For Scotland, privatisation too has often meant
denationalisation.
If the Scottish Conservative Party had not been so dozy, it would have
worked out its own programme of privatisation from the start. I think I
can tell you why it did not: it still believed, at least in its higher
echelons, that the state ought to run the economy, that Scotland was
best served by central bureaucracy.
In 1983 the Adam Smith Institute published the Omega Report on
Scottish policy, of which I was among the authors, pointing out that the
Thatcherite revolution had thus far stopped at the Border, and setting
forth a wide range of ideas for correcting the situation.
A good deal of what we had to say was in line with policies actually
adopted in England in the glory days of Thatcherism. In Scotland another
whole Parliament passed before anything much was done. That ought not to
have surprised us. A senior official of the party, now in the House of
Lords, had commented on the appearance of the report: ''We would not
touch this with a bargepole.''
While stamping on all internal debate about policy -- the same sort of
people claim even today that only presentation is the problem -- the
party snapped to attention whenever orders came down from London.
It would be idle to deny that the late Prime Minister turned more
imperious as the time went on, but she was always willing to listen to
ideas. Unfortunately the Scots Tories could offer no ideas, because they
had banned ideas. Like the rest of Scotland, they were still stuck in
the dependency culture. They relied on others to tell them what to do.
So they could never persuade Scots that privatisation, or capitalism
generally, was something for them, something in which all could take
part and reap rewards, or not, as the case may be. Instead privatisation
was imposed from on high, and came across as an attack on Scotland, as
English imperialism.
If it is not too late to save anything from the wreck of Scottish
Conservatism, its ways have to be changed. It has to cast off its own
dependency, and show Scots at large how they can cast off their
dependency too. The continued independence of Scottish Nuclear would be
a relatively small symbol of that, but the importance of symbols lies in
the very fact of their signifying something larger.
From all we hear, the scheme for privatising the British nuclear
industry which will go to the Cabinet tomorrow reflects a centralising
mentality. It will set up a monopoly in order to maximise the return
from the sale.
But we ought to have learned that privatisations in this shape have
their long-term cost, which should properly be offset against the
short-term gain. A good deal of time and trouble has had to be spent, in
the cases of telecoms, gas and electricity, on injecting competition
into privatised monopolies.
In retrospect, it would have been better to carry out the
restructuring at the time of flotation, and get rid of the monopolies
rather than rely on the regulation of them. The privatisation of two
nuclear companies would avoid these past mistakes from the outset.
While there are still things to be said on both sides of the economic
argument, the political argument for the independence of Scottish
Nuclear is overwhelming. The advice the Government gets from or about
Scotland must be incredibly bad if it has not noticed the potential
political damage before the Cabinet is on the point of taking a
decision.
Let me give it some good advice. Scotland's future lies not in
subsidies from central bureaucracy, but in a competitive private
economy. To that end, there is no substitute for competitive private
companies based in Scotland. If the Government cannot see that, than
perhaps we may be forced to conclude that it really has written Scotland
off.

Allan Laing reports how the BBC finds itself under attack from all
sides because of its policy of halting drama commissions in an attempt
to balance the books
LIKE stacking time at Heathrow Airport, the writers are queueing up to
attack the BBC. Already this week we have had Alan Plater and Jimmy
McGovern dispatching strongly-worded missives to Broadcasting House,
expressing their deep concern for the future -- or rather lack of it --
of drama production. With a pincer movement from the north, Scottish
writer Peter MacDougall is also said to be on the attack.
And now, speaking to The Herald, top television dramatist Andrew
Davies joins the chorus of disapproval. He suspects that the chickens in
director general John Birt's producer-choice ethos are coming home to
roost.
At the heart of the argument is the BBC's halt to the commissioning of
new programmes, a measure which has been caused by an acute cash
squeeze. The BBC has promised the Government to cut its borrowing from
almost #200m (the figure for two years ago) to nil by the end of next
year, coinciding with the renewal of its charter. The figure currently
stands at #80m.
Mr Davies, the writer of some of the finest BBC dramas of recent
years, including House of Cards, Middlemarch, and A Very Peculiar
Practice, is a man of outspoken and deeply-held opinion. Earlier this
year, when delivering the Huw Wheldon Lecture, he castigated television
bosses for running successful dramas into the ground, of chasing the
ratings at the expense of quality.
Yesterday he said: ''I am inclined to suspect, as a lot of people have
been suspecting all along, that this Birtian revolution at the BBC has
been completely misguided from the start. It has just put in lots of new
levels of management to spend money in ways that have nothing to do with
making programmes while getting rid of some of the most valuable people.
I think they have spent money on the wrong kind of things -- notably
accountants and enormously expensive management consultancy exercises.''
The Birt story had all along been that by making these great savings,
more money would be released to make programmes. ''It is very hard to
see how the savings made from sacking programme staff could improve the
output. All it seems to have done is to create new management structures
which are really more expensive,'' he added.
Agreeing wholeheartedly with his screenwriting colleagues, he said
that single drama seemed to be targeted by the BBC because it was
expensive and it did not appear to be getting great ratings --
''probably because the BBC doesn't have much confidence in promoting
it''.
He added: ''It is enormously important that it be kept going because
it is where the big, fresh ideas almost always come from.''
Reports suggest that the present situation is so critical that BBC
chiefs have searched the vaults and blown the dust from several unseen
dramas, previously considered surplus to requirements. They now plan to
show them over the ensuing year. The cash squeeze has also raised
worries about a fresh round of job losses, most of them involving people
on short-term contracts, as the corporation attempts to make further
savings.
However, the BBC in London maintains that the freeze on commissions
will not affect its plans for programmes in the coming year. Indeed,
fewer repeats are expected to be broadcast this summer than in the past.
Such comments are unlikely to satisfy the BBC's critics who are more
concerned about the longer term. Jimmy McGovern, writer of the
BAFTA-winning Cracker, has written to Alan Yentob, the BBC1 controller,
expressing his concern that single dramas, films, and plays would bear
the brunt of the cuts.
In a letter to Will Wyatt, managing director of BBC television, Alan
Plater, who penned A Very British Coup and Fortunes of War, said that
there was an underlying concern that the BBC was sinking in a
philosophical quagmire. If it insisted upon embracing a market ethos why
then should it be shackled to a zero borrowing requirement?

A PIT bull terrier was saved from death yesterday because of her total
lack of aggression.
A sheriff, who observed that the Dangerous Dogs Act had all the
hallmarks of rushed legislation, ruled that temperament had to be the
key factor when deciding whether a dog needed to be registered.
The terrier, called Tanya, was put in kennels under sentence of death
a year ago after her owner, Mr Ronald Tobin, pled guilty to owning an
unregistered American pit bull terrier.
However, the High Court allowed him on appeal to change his plea to
not guilty.
Mr Tobin, now of Boardman Street, Todmorden, West Yorkshire, told
Kirkwall Sheriff Court in Orkney: ''I mollycoddled her and brought her
up absolutely soft.''
Giving his verdict yesterday, Sheriff Colin Scott MacKenzie found
28-year-old Mr Tobin not guilty.
He said the Dangerous Dogs Act ''bears the impression of having been
rushed through Parliament in the wake of a number of tragic incidents up
and down the country''.
If there is no prosecution appeal, Mr Tobin will be allowed to collect
Tanya from kennels in West Lothian in seven days.

IN spring a young woman's fancy turns to thoughts of foreign climes.
The feeble rays of the Scottish sun sends us out to splash suntan lotion
over our milky-white shoulders (a procedure followed by the splashing
out of vast sums on Boots fake tan), while we think fondly of the baking
ovens of Mediterranean beaches.
Sensible types will have smugly planned their getaway, booking in the
winter months. We spontaneous -- ie disorganised -- types like to leave
it till the last minute, relying on terrible disasters and disabling
illnesses (ha ha, 'tis no more than they deserve) befalling the sensible
types which will enable us to snatch up cut-price cancellations from
below their flu-streaming noses.
Well, that's the theory. In practice it means you usually have to
resort to the very worst of resorts and end up mainlining tequila
sunrises on the British lager-lout packed beaches of Torremolinos,
straining to catch whatever sun hasn't been blocked by the shadow cast
by the Blobby family from Basildon on the next beach towel.
The Great Trek Around the Travel Agents strikes terror into my very
heart. One should be aware of one's frailties and my chief
characteristic is a sheeplike vulnerability to advertising ploys.
I daren't enter these dens of iniquity. I'm too malleable to cope with
enticing offers of far-flung shores, far too easily misled. If I try to
book a two-week break I'd end up smitten by a Round-the-World ticket
deal.
I actually get light-headed in front of travel posters; my pulse
starts beating to the mantra of Escape! Escape! I fantasise about
packing in my job and packing up my flat and I start making quick
calculations about the square foot area of my best mate's already
chok-a-block hall cupboard. ''If I chucked out my computer, stereo,
telly, video, albums, books, dinner service and all my winter clothes
I'm sure I can store the rest away.''
This restlessness is provoked by the fact that so many of my peers
seem to be taking off into the wild yonder. Increasing numbers of
twentysomethings aren't building nests, they're flying from them on the
first jumbo jet out of Gatwick.
In the past few months two acquaintances have upped sticks and offed,
one to the beach-bum culture of Australia, another to the nobler calling
of voluntary work on an Angolan refugee camp. I toasted their farewell
with envy in my soul.
The tradition of taking a year out after university to InterRail
around Europe, waitress on the Med or try the hippy dysentery diet of
India has been superseded by a new trend.
Smart types didn't swan off to Israel. They spend their vacations
working for free in advertising agencies, building up the kind of
freebies which gave them the sort of salaries which mean they can now
trot off to exotic climes which are much more exotic, with skills which
enable them to snap up trendy jobs which are far superior to selling
water melons on the beaches of Nice, and with a stash of cash which
means they don't have to slum it en route as they flounce around the
world.
Like I did. I slummed for Scotland. When my fellow students were going
gung-ho on the milk rounds I decided to, like, hey, get out of the rat
race, shook off all my worldly belongings and took off with a rucksack
and a few hundred quid to explore the world and find myself. I found out
I was a prat.
As a year out it wasn't a big success; for a start I only survived six
months. I came back skint and slightly schizoid bang in the middle of a
Scottish winter. I hadn't had a computer or a video to chuck out but I
rued the day I had ditched my wok and wardrobe. I shivered through
January in a tie-dye summer dress trekking through the slush to the dole
office in open-toe sandals.
And years later I can't even boast of it now. When everyone around you
is detailing their amazing experiences publicising arts festivals in
Melbourne, running hip nightclubs in the Caribbean or bivouacking
through Borneo jungles there is no street cred to be had in piping up
that you hung out in a kibbutz and were a barmaid in Crete. Talk about
feeling inadequate.
My feelings of inferiority have just been heightened by the temporary
return of a friend, Craig, who has been cycling round the Ring of Fire
for charity. He has spent the last 3[1/2] years dicing with death across
South America, cycling up a 19,000ft dormant volcano in Ecuador,
crossing the Hill of Death in Nicaragua, zooming through Honduras in 24
hours and fighting off hepatitis, dengue fever and a broken collarbone
on the way. Now he's a tip-top photographer in Mexico City.
Worra guy. That's enough street cred for a lifetime, and he's not even
finished yet. ''What have you been up to?'' he asked over a pint. I
changed the subject. Let's face it, a trip to San Tropez doesn't even
register on the hipdom scale.
So, now I'm once more haunted by the notion that I'm a mere credit
card away from bye y'all. Fifteen Visa digits is all that stands between
me and potentially life-enhancing adventures, foreign romances and a
decent deep tan.
But while the sheep in me bleats that the world is my oyster, the
chicken in me clucks that travel broadens the mind but narrows the
finances. Oh, what the heck, I'm off instead on a fun frenzy with eight
mad London girlfriends. Look out Tenerife, here I come; my cultural tour
of duty will have to wait awhile.

Tory MP Nicholas Budgen, one of The Gang of Nine
Euro-rebels deprived of the party Whip, describes life as a political
outcast at Westminster and in his constituency, and outlines his hopes
for the future now that he is back in the fold
ON Monday last I received a short letter from the Tory Chief Whip,
Richard Ryder. He stated: ''I am writing to confirm that, as from today,
the Whip has been restored to you, and I am pleased to enclose this
week's copy. If you do not wish to receive the Whip in future, then you
should let me have your formal resignation of it in writing.''
So the Whip has been restored to all of us so-called rebels at the
same time and unconditionally. It has been a long journey since we were
thrown out of the Conservative Party at the end of November. At first
the Prime Minister and the party leaders tried to get us deselected and
thus end our parliamentary careers. We were described publicly as
self-indulgent and disloyal. Then by the New Year we were described as
being among the most conservative of MPs. The long, but not wholly
consistent, process of accommodating us had begun. After the Scottish
local elections at the beginning of April, the Prime Minister and Ian
Lang tried to blame us and general disunity for the Tories' poor
results.
So what has it been like to be a Whipless Tory MP for about five
months? We have survived so far politically because we are symbols of
national resistance to increasing rule from Brussels. Of course, we vary
in character and our constituencies vary also. Some of the support for
our views was accidental. For instance, during the debates on the
Maastricht Treaty the chairman of my constituency association was a
vigorous and articulate lady who is the wife of an industrial banker.
She was a Tory loyalist with strong personal ambitions. She regularly
attacked me on the television and gave an impression of considerable
disagreement in the constituency with my views.
After Maastricht her husband changed his job and she moved with him.
Then the new chairman was a lowland Scot who is both a unionist and also
Euro-sceptical. I do not, of course, say that everyone agrees with me.
But the attitude of my constituency association varied between reluctant
acquiescence and open approval.
We so-called rebels had very similar experiences of public opinion.
The English Conservative constituency associations are dominated by
councillors and their supporters. The Tory local candidates ask for a
stable and successful Tory Government while they are campaigning for
local elections. However much the Tory activists agreed with us, they
were reluctant to rock the boat, or indeed see it rocked by others.
Activists are mostly loyalists also.
But it was the world outside Conservative politics which demonstrated
the rising mood of public hostility to an expensive and increasingly
more federal Europe. We all received an enormously increased number of
letters. They came from Conservatives in our constituencies and often
from former Conservatives (the people who write ''I have always voted
Conservative, but . . .'')
I do not have many personal links with Scotland but Richard Shepherd
is an Aberdonian who retains strong links there. Teddy Taylor needs no
introduction from me. His seat may be in Southend now but much of his
heart remains in Cathcart. So we all received thousands -- yes,
thousands -- of letters from all the parts of the UK where we had any
personal roots. Often our correspondents would make their letters more
effective by sending a copy to their local MP.
So it was that it became obvious to everyone interested in politics
that there was huge public concern over Europe and a rising fear that
the partial consensus on the subject in the House of Commons was
depriving the public of information and debate.
We were fortunate in that just before we were thrown out the European
Court of Auditors pointed to the massive and endemic fraud in the use of
EC funds, particularly in agriculture. The support we got from the
politicians in our constituencies and in the House of Commons arose most
of all because they knew that we were expressing widely-held views which
had often in the past not been fully expressed.
We found that in general our social relations in the House of Commons
were not altered by our exclusion. We could not go to party meetings but
we mixed in the same dining rooms and bars. I know of no friendship or
even acquaintanceship that was damaged by our exclusion. This was not
so, for instance, over the dispute in the Tory Party concerning
appeasement in the period of the Munich Agreement before the last war.
Then the anger was so bitter that friends and families were divided --
often for a long time.
Only a few times did I find real hostility expressed towards me. A
very few activists in my constituency party believed that all public
dissent in the Tory Party was wrong. In my private life I enjoy horses
and hunting. Once at a race meeting an old acquaintance volunteered an
earful for my disloyalty to Mr Major.
Out hunting, a substantial farmer from Durham gave me a short blast
''You b------s will let Labour in then we shall have higher taxes and no
hunting.'' I'm sure their views were genuine but may have been more
readily expressed because both people were heavily dependent for funds
from the Common Agricultural Policy.
So why did we accept back, or at any rate not reject, the Whip? First,
we understand the argument that Tory candidates at local elections
prefer a united party. It is, of course, not certain how important this
factor is. But it is a factor. We owe a tremendous debt to the dedicated
voluntary workers in the Tory Party. They are the true idealists and
people of principle in politics. Secondly, we believe in the importance
of party in politics. An independent or a representative of a splinter
group may win an occasional parliamentary election but in the end ideas
can only be carried into action by the give-and-take of big-party
politics. The Gang of Four, for all Roy Jenkins's elegance and intellect
in Scotland, were a passing phenomenon. The Gang of Nine would have gone
the same way.
We are now fortunate. The Tory Party is showing an increasingly
nationalistic attitude in European matters. We now recognise the prior
claim of the Canadian fishermen. The Prime Minister and the Home
Secretary have emphasised the need to retain control over our national
borders. There will be no immigration policy imposed by Brussels. On
March 1, in an important speech in the House of Commons, the Prime
Minister was more sceptical than ever over a single currency. We want to
be in the party and to continue to influence and advance this trend of
thought.
On the other hand, the Labour Party is more and more a party of
Euro-federalism. They are in favour of the Social Chapter and high
minimum wages. They want to join the single currency as soon as
possible.
The greatest dangers to our democracy arise not from noise and dissent
but from good manners and too much agreement and political correctness.
At last the consensus is shattered; the two great parties prepare to
offer the people a real choice on the overriding issue of Europe at the
next General Election. We, the former rebels, are proud to play a small
part.

POLICE frogmen today will resume their search for two divers reported
missing while exploring the hull of a sunken Second World War ammunition
supply ship on Monday.
The men were with a group diving on the SS Breda, which lies 60ft
below the surface in Ardmucknish Bay, north of Oban.
A colleague lost contact with the divers while exploring the ship's
hold and raised the alarm when they failed to surface.
The missing men have been named as Mr David Waterhouse, 29, of
Deeside, Clwyd, and Mr David Weaver, 26, of Nercwys, Mold, both North
Wales.
Police at Oban said that parts of the steamship were unstable and
diving parties had been warned about the danger.
* LOBSTER fisherman John Woodrow, 54, of South Crescent, Port Wemyss,
Islay, died yesterday when, it is believed, his foot became entangled in
his nets as he laid them, and he was dragged overboard.
A rescue bid was mounted when villagers saw an unmanned boat sailing
under power off the Isle of Islay but Mr Woodrow was confirmed dead at a
local hospital.
On Monday, in a similar incident off Skye, a fisherman raised the
alarm after spotting an abandoned boat still operating.
However, the missing fisherman -- who was wearing a lifejacket -- was
rescued from a small uninhabited island to which he had managed to swim.

THOUGH it took the worst of tragedies to remind America that a
spectacularly large number of its citizens are God-fearing, gun-loving
psychopaths of a deeply conservative disposition, the extent of the
problem still hasn't sunk in. Which is to say that if you must have
regiments of conspiracy freaks, at least teach them how to construct
some real working paranoia.
It was one thing when they were going on about commies, international
financiers, gays, the liberal media, satanic pop groups and
abortionists. What is it, all of a sudden, with the United Nations, now
held by the laugh-a-minute ''militias'' to be the latest evil empire
about to take over their country?
Not just the UN, you understand; the federal government is in on this
too. The hot video among militias just before Oklahoma City wiped the
smile off every face in the world was a thing called America in Peril.
It states that the feds are even now assembling a secret police force to
assist the UN putsch, its members recruited from the National Guard, LA
street gangs and, um, gurkhas.
Will they stop at nothing? Students of current affairs will be
familiar with the UN's track record, however. Pulling out all the stops,
it couldn't invade Portobello beach on a clear day. The idea that it has
designs on the continental United States is rather like believing that
the Smurfs are a front organisation for Iran's mullahs, or that Nato has
been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (which it has: and now the
votes of the Bosnian jury).
For all these reasons, and many more, we were somehow unsurprised to
note that the Michigan University expert dug up by Channel 4 news the
other night to measure the distance between the US and reality rejoices
in the name of Professor John Jacob Nutter.
Carve your own
NOT ALL Americans are crazy, of course; some are just deeply mistaken
on a regular basis. Thus a Mr Halfdan Prahl was arrested in Westport,
Connecticut, in February after he burst into a restaurant and terrified
patrons by carving his initials on the bar -- with a chainsaw.
Invited to explain his behaviour, Halfdan stated that the owner was a
friend who, he felt sure, would find his artwork amusing. Police then
explained to Mr Prahl that his pal had recently sold the restaurant.
Exclusive
BLEEDING heart liberals can be loopy too, as anyone who has read Tony
Blair's new Clause 4 -- Labour's answer to Mills &amp; Boon -- will realise.
Thus a University of Pennsylvania student group, White Women Against
Racism, recently rejected a black woman who wanted to join.
A spokesperson said whites have to meet among themselves to understand
why whites so often exclude blacks, adding, ''Racism is a white problem
and we have a responsibility as white women in particular to do what we
can to eradicate it.''
Most moving
CATS, that really very wonderful and original musical created by Sir
Andrew Lloyd-Webber with a little help from Old Possum Eliot, is still
running in London. Running at the New London Theatre, Drury Lane, to be
precise, where the management invites patrons to arrive promptly for the
show. Or as an ad has it: ''Latecomers not admitted while auditorium is
in motion.''
A right knit
ONE OF the joys of home teleworking (other than dumb computer games,
the odd nap, and losing the power of speech) is the insight it yields
into day-time television. Thus it was yesterday that a thespian
ploughing through Country Practice on ITV could utter a line that spoke
for all actors trapped in soaps: ''This pile of woven wool is doing its
best to humiliate me.''
That's the game
SCOTLAND on Sunday is, as we mentioned recently, a newspaper that
strives to offer a comprehensive service. The other week it spared
readers the necessity of suffering a TV thriller by reviewing the show
before it was transmitted; this Sunday it went one better and abolished
the years 1996 and 1997 inclusive.
It didn't take much, just a really very funny and wholly non-partisan
little piece calling for measures to prevent Rangers from winning too
often. Fair enough. ''Given that Glasgow Rangers have recently won the
Premier League for the ninth consecutive year . . .'' it began.
Tell Walter and the boys they can have the next 24 months off.
One in the teeth
ISN'T French a lovely language? After the first-round results came in,
the daily Liberation ran the headline ''Chirac by the skin of his
teeth''. In French, this comes out as ''Chirac ric-rac''. Wonder what
they'd make of Douglas Hurd? Actually, old Jacques knows how to take it
on the chin. After he blew it in 1988 his loyal wife Bernadette told the
press: ''The French people do not like my husband.'' Small wonder that
Norma Major keeps her opinions to herself.
Meanwhile, we are reminded of one of the many snappy slogans which put
Chirac on the rack. On fiscal policy: ''Too much tax kills taxation.''
Still Lobbying
IN his long advert in yesterday's Diary for the Third Annual Lobey
Dosser party, Tom Shields gave full details of the entertainment -- an
inaugural Bud Neill lecture by Cliff Hanley; music by the Frank O'Hagan
Cowboy Band; and a reading by Walter McCorrisken, the world's worst
poet.
Mr Shields proved himself to be the world's worst reporter by failing
to inform readers of the actual date of the celebration. For the record,
it takes place this coming Saturday at 2pm at the Halt Bar, 160
Woodlands Road, Glasgow. Mr Shields wishes to apologise to those who
turned up yesterday a touch early for the party and hopes they enjoyed
their pints anyway.

Despite an improving insurance market, crisis-hit Lloyd's could still
be brought down by a legacy of past mistakes. Christopher Sims reports
THE incongruous setting of an elegant eighteenth-century drawing-room
located inside one of London's most dramatic modern buildings was the
venue yesterday for arguably the most crucial meeting in the whole
308-year history of Lloyd's of London.
Around the oval mahogany table the 18 members of the Council of
Lloyd's were thrashing out ways in which the venerable institution could
be saved in the face of mounting losses.
The council chamber is a reminder of Lloyd's venerable past and is
taken apart and reassembled each time Lloyd's moves into a new building.
Now it sits oddly in Richard Rogers's curious ''inside out'' building
which currently houses the institution.
Lloyd's losses and unquantifiable future liabilities are putting the
market at risk of collapse. Needless to say, such a catastrophe would be
a disaster for the City of London's reputation, particularly coming on
top of upsets like the Barings scandal. It would have a direct and a
knock-on effect on the City's earning power, which is so important for
the economy.
For consumers it would mean the end of cheap insurance in specialist
fields, since Lloyd's is ideally suited to take on the more unusual
risks. Failure would mean the loss of up to 60,000 jobs, though some
form of insurance market would probably be resurrected from the ruins.
An air of crisis has been hanging over Lloyd's for some years as a
result of huge losses and the refusal of some ''names'' or members to
pay up. They provide the financial backing for underwriting and are
liable down to their last penny. Insurance claims which they should have
funded have been paid by Lloyd's central funds, but this cannot continue
indefinitely. Many of the names could ultimately face bankruptcy.
The market's problems are coming to a head with the possibility that
it could fail the Government-imposed solvency test, which would force it
to stop taking new business.
Like all insurance companies, Lloyd's has each year to pass a solvency
test set by the Department of Trade and Industry, which measures whether
its assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities. This is to ensure, as
far as possible, that consumers won't be left in the lurch by the
failure of an insurance company.
The ruling Council of Lloyd's insists that as the market passed its
solvency test last year, it will do so again in 1995. Actually it cannot
say anything else, because if it thought at any time the market was
insolvent, it would be obliged to stop Lloyd's taking on new business.
Industry observers are not so sure the test, due in August, will be
passed.
The council bases its more hopeful stance on the swift recovery in
Lloyd's fortunes which is taking place. Figures next month are likely to
see losses topping #1000m for the 1992 account, taking the cumulative
deficit to nearly #8000m. The market accounts three years in arrears to
allow time for late claims to come in. But analysts reckon this will
mark the end of losses and the 1993 year will bounce back to a surplus
of perhaps #1000m, with a further gain in 1994. This belief is supported
by the profits showing so far on these open years.
Lloyd's underwriters, who are backed financially by the names, are now
more selective over the risks they take on and have raised premiums and
cut costs.
The performance is improving rapidly, but may come to nothing because
of the legacy of past mistakes. The problem is that these old policies
are open-ended. The customer may have stopped paying premiums years ago
but claims for pollution damage and asbestosis, for example, are coming
forward on their policies -- some dating back to the 1940s. The problem
may have been created when the policy was in force, but did not come to
light until many years later.
Hazards have been found which did not exist when the underwriter sold
the policy, so he is not to blame. However, the names who have to pick
up the bill complain, with justification, that in the heady 1980s,
underwriters were lax in their assessment of premiums and policy
conditions.
Worse, they argue that they were stuffed into this sort of business
which the professionals avoided. In other words, the professionals
creamed off the best business, leaving the rest to the innocent names,
who were only in Lloyds as investors.
It is now accepted that negligence did happen. Indeed, a group of
names have successfully sued their agents, who arranged the placing of
business, for hundreds of millions of pounds -- the exact amount is in
doubt.
People were persuaded to become names who should never have
contemplated it. There was a social cachet involved, but Lloyd's was
always only an investment for the seriously rich. Names who have lost
everything claim they were duped, but the risk of unlimited liability is
quite plain, and they did sign on the dotted line.
Now some 9000 out of 30,000 past and present names are refusing to
meet their liabilities, and more are awaiting the outcome of complex
litigation. They are not without muscle, given that pursuing bankruptcy
against so many individuals is impractical. The Council of Lloyd's is
now working on a plan to cap the past liabilities through transferring
them to a new company.
An earlier attempt to reach a settlement with the dissident names
failed, but this stands much greater chance of success. However, it may
be accompanied by a further levy on names to bolster the market's
central funds, which are being steadily depleted. Many names feel so
aggrieved they may refuse to pay this, and would actually be happy for
Lloyd's to collapse.
A sense of urgency is now building to get the rescue plan in place by
the time of Lloyd's annual meeting on May 30. Success in this would
reduce fears over the vital solvency test, which is the make-or-break.
If it can get through this year it will probably be in the clear owing
to the much-improved current results.

Bruce McKain examines how Court of Session actions by two grieving
families aim to challenge High Court murder trial verdicts
THE parents of murdered student Amanda Duffy have now joined the widow
and children of Greenock taxi driver Raymond Mullan in refusing to
accept the finality of a High Court jury verdict in a murder trial.
In damages actions which pose issues of fundamental importance for the
Scottish legal system, the grieving families have now raised proceedings
in the Court of Session, Scotland's supreme civil court.
Mrs Margaret Mullan and her three children are suing for #100,000 in
what Court of Session judge Lord Morison described as a ''unique and
novel'' case. Their action is at a fairly advanced stage and will
probably lay down ground rules for actions of this kind, assuming the
Court of Session judges think they should be allowed to go ahead at all.
Some lawyers argue that there are persuasive public policy reasons for
not using civil actions to interfere with a jury's acquittal verdict in
criminal proceedings.
Mr Mullan was stabbed through the heart during a taxi journey from
Gourock to Greenock in February 1990. He was 38 when he died.
His family are suing Mr David Anderson, of Nelson Road, Gourock, who
was charged with the taxi driver's murder but acquitted on a not proven
verdict at the High Court in Paisley in May 1990.
Joe and Kate Duffy are suing Mr Francis Auld for #50,000 over the
death of their daughter, who was murdered near a car park in Hamilton in
May 1992. Mr Auld stood trial at the High Court in Glasgow in November
that year and, again, the jury found the case not proven.
In the normal civil case the purpose of the action is to recover
damages from whoever is being sued by establishing that he caused loss
or damage by acting negligently.
Whether that is the true purpose behind the actions by the Mullans and
the Duffys is open to doubt. Certainly, both are claiming significant
sums of money, but the chances of either Mr Anderson or Mr Auld having
any money to recover are remote. Mr Anderson is apparently unemployed
and has no assets.
Five judges considered this point in the Mullan case when they decided
it was of such importance that future proceedings must be in the Court
of Session rather than the Sheriff Court.
Lord Morison stated: ''The reality of the matter is that Mr Anderson
is at risk of being branded for the rest of his life as a murderer and,
indeed, this is the result which Mrs Mullan obviously hopes to achieve.
''It is obvious that the primary importance for the Mullan family lies
not in their wish to obtain compensation, but because they seek to
rectify what they regard as the injustice of Mr Anderson's acquittal.''
Similarly, Mrs Duffy told The Herald yesterday that securing the
#50,000 was not the object of the civil action. Her view, no doubt
shared by the Mullans, is that this is the only redress for victims and
their families let down by the legal system.
The argument against allowing a civil action in cases like this is
that the case has already been decided in the proper court by a jury
applying the appropriate standard of proof -- proof beyond reasonable
doubt.
By going to the civil courts people are trying to achieve by a lesser
standard of proof -- on a balance of probabilities -- a verdict that
they couldn't get in the High Court.
Some will see the launching of these two civil actions as another
attack on the not proven verdict, which Mr and Mrs Duffy have campaigned
to have abolished.
But in principle there seems to be no reason why similar actions could
not be raised even after a verdict of not guilty, again on the basis
that it is easier to prove a civil case than a criminal one.
The Scottish Legal Board will also be keeping a wary eye on
developments because of the implications for the public purse should the
Mullan and Duffy cases open the floodgates.
The Duffys are funding their own case through ''hard-earned savings''
and a public appeal fund, but Mrs Mullan was granted legal aid, which
would be essential for most people in their situation.
There would also be questions of whether the family of a murder victim
had received a previous award from the Criminal Injuries Compensation
Board.
Solicitor Peter Anderson, who is acting for the Duffys, said that as
far as he knew the Duffy and Mullan cases were the first of their kind
in Scotland and he is not entirely clear as to why that should be.
''The remedy being sought by the Duffys is certainly not so startling
that lawyers would not have thought of it before. It may be that in the
past people thought that raising an action of this kind was a waste of
money. It may be that in the past there was an attitude that people did
not wish to 'pillory' wrongdoers. It might just be that the whole
attitude of society has changed. In my experience, it's certainly the
case that whenever there has been a major disaster, there is a group
saying 'We are not really interested in the money, we just want the
truth'.''
What does seem clear is that in the near future the Court of Session
will have to make a public policy decision as to whether such cases
should be allowed in Scotland.
A legal debate in the Mullan case is the most likely way for that to
be achieved.

A MOTHER who claimed her baby son was brain damaged at birth as a
result of medical negligence settled a #1m damages claim against Lothian
Health Board out of court yesterday.
Evidence was due to be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh when
it was announced that the child's mother, Ms Janice Brown, of Hay Drive,
Edinburgh, had accepted a six-figure sum in settlement of her claim
against the board.
The board also will have to pay her legal costs.
Ms Brown, in her action, claimed her son Daniel, five, was born in
Edinburgh's Eastern General Hospital suffering from severe asphyxia on
September 9, 1989.
She claimed medical staff attending the birth were negligent and
should have delivered the baby by caesarean section at an earlier stage,
and not have delayed taking action.
Ms Brown maintained that if the delivery had been carried out earlier
after monitoring of abnormal foetal heartbeats, her baby would not have
been born brain damaged. She claimed that her expected delivery date was
August 26, 1989.
She was admitted to hospital on September 8 at term plus 13 days and
was said to be suffering from raised blood pressure.
The baby was delivered by caesarean section after an attempt at a
forceps delivery failed.
Ms Brown claimed that as a result of this negligence her son was born
suffering from severe asphyxia.
Mrs Anne Smith, QC for Ms Brown, told the court: ''We have settled for
a substantial six-figure sum. This case is worth a substantial sum of
money.''
The boy will require constant care for the rest of his life. He cannot
speak, sit alone, walk, crawl or roll over. He cannot hold anything,
suffers frustration, and screams a great deal.
He is a pupil at Westerlea School, Murrayfield, and Ms Brown wants to
buy a house near the school, which at present is an hour's bus ride from
home.
Ms Brown said that her present flat was in an area frequented by drug
addicts and alcoholics.
Lord Clyde said he would find the health board liable for expenses.

<HEADLINE>Conservationist breaks ranks over superquarry</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978698476</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LEADING conservationist yesterday told the inquiry into the proposed
superquarry at Lingerbay on Harris that National Scenic Areas (NSAs)
were never intended to be totally undeveloped.
Mr Michael Taylor, a director of the Scottish Scenic Trust and a
former director of the Countryside Commission for Scotland, was giving
evidence as an individual on the 74th day of the inquiry at Leverburgh
in Harris.
Redland Aggregates Ltd plans to extract 600 million tonnes of
anorthosite over a 60-year period from Lingerbay, within an NSA.
Scottish Scenic Trust was one of the organisations in the
environmental coalition, Link, opposing the application.
However, yesterday, Mr Taylor said he would not be appearing as a
witness for Link as he did not endorse some of its arguments.
He told Chief Inquiry Reporter Gillian M Pain: ''The trust's position,
which I also hold, is that coastal quarrying cannot be totally opposed
in principle as there is a national need for minerals, part of which
will be expected to be obtained at least cost to the environment, by a
few large (coastal) superquarries.
''It would be preferable if coastal quarries were not allowed in
National Scenic Areas, if at all possible.''
He said that recent Scottish Office planning policy on mineral working
-- Guideline Four -- made it ''difficult to see how NSAs'' could be left
untouched.
A 1988 policy review by Cobham Resource Consultants for the
Countryside Commission for Scotland -- since replaced by Scottish
National Heritage -- commented on the relative ineffectiveness of NSAs
but, said Mr Taylor, nothing had been made of this.
He added: ''The situation therefore remains unsatisfactory.
He said NSAs were never intended to be totally undeveloped and
inviolate but neither had the extent to which large-scale developments
should be permitted in them been defined.
''This inquiry should assist in determining this but there is still an
urgent need for a thorough review of the ways in which the effectiveness
of NSAs can be improved.''
Mrs Morag Munro, secretary of the Quarry Benefit Group -- set up to
negotiate with the developers on behalf of the community -- told the
inquiry another referendum on the superquarry was to be held by the
Electoral Reform Society at a cost of #1600. The results will be known
by May 22.
A referendum in June 1993 resulted in a two to one vote for the
quarry.

MARKET forces have been strongly criticised for their supposedly ill
effects, but since becoming chairman of PIK Holdings Ltd, the owners of
Prestwick Airport, I have found that they can be of great benefit to the
travelling public.
When the Government declared its ''Open Skies'' policy in 1991,
Prestwick lost its role as the sole transatlantic gateway into Scotland.
British Airports, which then ran Prestwick, quickly ensured that the
existing transatlantic traffic was transferred to Abbotsinch. They
clearly had no idea what they did want to do with Prestwick, and before
long they sold it, and PIK took over.
New management, and an enthusiastic workforce, have since worked
wonders. Many of the buildings have been refurbished, flexible working
introduced, and at long last a railway station has been built and linked
in to the terminal building. Much new business is now coming in, and
this year there will be more passengers passing through Prestwick than
at any time in its history. How has this been done?
International passenger traffic is regulated by treaties between
countries, and where this restricts competition the result is usually
high fares, which price travel beyond the pockets of many people. If
market forces were allowed to operate, would more people actually
travel? PIK is now providing a fascinating answer.
Last summer, the low costs at Prestwick and an enterprising operator,
Ryanair, produced a new, scheduled service between Prestwick and Dublin,
at very much lower fares than the existing services from Abbotsinch. It
was immediately a great success.
PIK expected to receive loud complaints of unfairness etc from the
existing operators, but there were none. The reason is as interesting as
it is unexpected. Despite the tens of thousands of passengers flying to
Dublin on the new, and cheaper, route via Prestwick, there was actually
an increase in the passenger figures for the older and more expensive
service from Abbotsinch. Thus, the cheaper fares actually created travel
opportunities for thousands of people who were not previously able to
afford to make the journey, and the market as a whole was increased.
Market forces, when properly used, can indeed be a boon to the
ordinary customer. This makes an interesting contrast with another side
of the experience of PIK -- the strongly growing carriage of air
freight.
On this, ''Open Skies'' do not yet apply, it seems. Permissions are
needed from the international agreements for each type of service, and
these permissions are termed ''freedoms''.
One of these is the ''fifth freedom'', which allows an airline which
has brought a cargo from say, the US, to fly on to a further destination
in Europe carrying freight from Scotland and then bringing a further
cargo back again.
This is of particular importance for Scotland. We have a large
electronics industry which absolutely relies on importing and exporting
vital components both eastwards and westwards. If we are not able to
give them the sort of services they require, they may well go elsewhere.
These permissions are normally only granted if they are negotiated by
our Government with the other government. In many cases the other
government is the US. Despite much lobbying with support from Scottish
Enterprise and others, our own Department of Transport has so far not
been successful. Apparently, the Department of Transport believes that
if they hold out against the rights for air freight, the US Department
of Transportation may be so keen to get them that they might grant
increased rights to British passenger airlines for increased access to
the US market. But this, frankly, is totally improbable.
American freight carriers already have ''fifth freedoms'' from other
European countries -- particularly France and Germany -- so if they
don't get them from us they will simply send goods by other routes which
bypass us.
Scotland's potential as a hub for air freight is great. Our
geographical position is not only near to the polar routes, which
reduces the air miles for operators, it also means that we are outwith
the overcrowded air traffic of central Europe, where it is difficult to
get landing slots at the main airports, and is also very vulnerable to
delays and industrial action by the dispute-happy air traffic
controllers of France and Spain.
Now there seems to be another chance opening up of a negotiation with
the US. Negotiators from our own Department of Transport are having
further talks in Washington. I do hope that this time they will feel the
urgent needs of multinational industry in Scotland will be more
important than the very remote possibility of yet more passenger access
for airlines operating from London across the Atlantic.
* George Younger, chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a former
Secretary of State for Scotland, will be writing an occasional column
for The Herald.

GLASGOW Royal Infirmary will be able to triple the number of childless
couples it can treat with the opening yesterday of a new #300,000
assisted conception suite.
The infertility unit at the hospital will be able to offer 750 cycles
of treatment -- including in vitro fertilisation -- instead of the 250
with which it had been able to deal.
Over the last 10 years, approximately 800 patients have been treated,
with more than 300 babies born to women patients from all over Scotland
as a result.
The services on offer include ovary stimulation, in vitro
fertilisation, and donor fertilisation. These were provided previously
in the gynaecology department with the administrative work being carried
out elsewhere in the hospital. The new facilities place the unit in the
top flight of UK fertility services.
It was founded in collaboration with Glasgow University and the
Nuffield Trust; a private service, which runs in parallel at Glasgow
Nuffield hospital. Each cycle of treatment costs between #2000 and#2500.
The Royal now has a success rate of 50% for IVF after three treatment
cycles, compared with 10% when the service started.
There are currently 700 couples on the waiting list for treatment,
with an average waiting time until now of three to four years.
The consultant in charge of the unit, Dr Robin Yates, said: ''We have
now reached the stage where providing infertility treatment has moved
from being research based to a general service available to NHS
patients.
''We can offer childless couples expertise based on a decade of
research which has seen the chances of conception increase
substantially, along with the finest back-up laboratory and treatment
facilities.''
The new purchaser-provider system in the health service has opened up
new opportunities for the Royal Infirmary to market the service to
health boards willing to allocate funding, although the effect of this
is that the area where couples live will determine how quickly they get
treatment.
''We had a common waiting list before the new NHS set-up but now we
have to have a waiting list for each health board,'' said Dr Yates.
''However, we don't include every patient who could be on the waiting
list -- I don't think our criteria could be any stricter.
''The couple must be in a stable relationship, have no children
residing with them, and up to now 37 has been the maximum age for a
woman to go on the waiting list. That is because we do not start
treating women over the age of 40.
''I think health boards are recognising that it is a treatment which
should be offered within the NHS under a strictly-agreed protocol. I
don't think everyone should be treated under the NHS but the NHS will
continue to be the biggest provider.''
Other developments in the pipeline include ICSI, a treatment pioneered
in Brussels and already used successfully by doctors in Aberdeen to help
couples where the man has a low sperm count. It entails taking an
individual sperm and injecting it directly into a retrieved egg before
re-implanting it.
Dr Yates said he did not believe male fertility had fallen generally;
however infertility affects one in seven couples, and one in 100 will
seek help from a unit like the Royal's.

THE Government was accused yesterday of ''unacceptable complacency''
over its treatment of the victims of crime.
The attack, by Labour Front Bench spokesman Mr John McFall, followed
publication of a Scottish Office survey which showed that only one in 10
victims believed that they were kept well-informed by police and the
courts.
Labour put down an amendment to the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill,
currently going through its Commons committee stage, demanding that a
formal system of victim liaison should be established by every court in
Scotland with criminal jurisdiction.
This would keep the victim informed of the progress and outcome of the
case against the accused, advise the victim about the procedure and
process of the court and support the victim during and after the court
proceedings.
The Government rejected the proposals, with Scottish Office Minister
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton stating that the Government needed more time
to consider the matter. He said: ''We have just received this research
report, which identifies the information needs of victims. The Crown
Office, the police and the Scottish Office need to consider in detail
how to develop a strategy for victims.''
Officials were anxious to point out that much more information already
was being made available to victims than ever before and that funding
for victim support schemes this year was #975,000 -- up 11% on the
previous year.
However, Mr McFall said the Government was damned by its own research,
indicating that only 7% of victims had contact with the victim support
network. Almost 40% who had not contacted VS said it was because no-one
had told them.
The Government also rejected a Labour call for a video recording to be
made of all police interviews with people arrested and taken into
custody.
It adopted a wait-and-see approach. Lord James said: ''There is a
pilot scheme in Lothian and we are in favour of this being progressively
developed in Scotland but we want to await the result of the pilot
scheme.''

A DRUNKEN man who put a young woman through a horrifying sex ordeal in
her home was jailed for seven years yesterday.
For more than three hours, Albert Newman kept the 24-year-old
Jehovah's Witness prisoner in her home, brandishing a knife and
threatening to kill her.
The High Court in Glasgow heard yesterday that his victim finally
managed to escape and run naked into the street screaming hysterically:
''I've been attacked. I've been raped.''
Mr Paul McBride, prosecuting, told the court the woman ran into a
jeweller's shop.
The jeweller and another man went to the woman's home and ''arrested''
47-year-old Newman, who was on the top stairs.
Mr McBride told the court that a medical examination revealed that
Newman, of no fixed address, was found to be suffering from genital
warts which indicated a sexually transmittable disease.
The advocate depute said it will be two years before it is known if
the woman has been infected.
Newman admitted forcing his way into the Cambuslang woman's home on
January 9 last, presenting a knife at her and threatening to kill her,
ripping her nightdress and repeatedly raping her.
The judge Lord Abernethy, who was told the accused had been drinking
for days before the offence, jailed him for seven years and told Newman:
''This was a dreadful crime.''
Mr McBride said the woman's husband left for work at 7.15am and she
got out of bed at 8.30am to prepare for Jehovah's Witness friends who
were due to visit her.
At 8.45am, she answered the door bell and was confronted by Newman,
who she did not know.
''She tried to close the door but he forced his way in and produced a
Stanley knife with the blade fully extended,'' said Mr McBride.
Newman pushed her on to the bed and warned: ''If you don't shut up I
will kill you.''
He then removed her clothing and pulled his jeans and underpants down
to his ankles.
Mr McBride then described how Newman indecently assaulted Mrs X before
raping her.
Afterwards, he asked if she had drink in the house and she told him
there was a bottle of vodka in the fridge.
After drinking this he again indecently assaulted Mrs X, bit her ear,
and raped her.
Mr McBride said that after more than three hours and while Newman was
drunk and slumped on the bed the woman thought she could run from the
house because his trousers and pants were round his ankles.
It was then she ran naked and hysterical into the street.
When charged by police, Newman replied: ''I'm telling you, my mind is
totally blacked out altogether. I've been drinking for days.''
Mr McBride said the accused had four previous convictions but none for
a sexual offence.
Mr Herbert Kerrigan, QC, defending, said the accused wished to
apologise unreservedly to Mrs X for this ''heinous'' offence.
He said the accused had been drinking for days. He had also been
drinking for some time in the stairwell of the woman's home before going
to her door.
Mr Kerrigan said Newman had blacked it from his mind.
He could not believe he could have done anything so awful.
''It is only recently that he has come to accept what he has done,''
said Mr Kerrigan.

Margaret Vaughan considers a report that highlights the threat to
industrial economies by the cost of looking after the elderly
THE old, grey and grumpy are coming to get you. Only joking. It's just
that apocalyptic visions of the aged dispossessed forming themselves
into a Tsk Force tend to have that kind of effect on you.
The warning that ageing dependants are threatening industrial
economies comes from an investigation of the ageing phenomena. The
Geneva-based International Labour Organisation's World Labour Report
undoubtedly means well in invoking the need for perestroika for
oppressed Third Agers. It focuses on the growing cost of keeping the
elderly in pensions and health care.
Workers, it points out, are choosing or, more often, being forced to
retire earlier and are living longer. The portents are gloomy: if these
two trends continue the social burden of the growing number of retirees
could cripple the industrialised economies unable to deal with the
soaring cost of ageing non-workers.
But while drawing attention to some of the problems that ageing
societies face is no doubt a valuable contribution to the debate,
conjuring up images of hoary hordes, rheumy eyes blazing, dentures
a'clicking, poised for revolt against the young, lithe, and employed
might seem a mite counter-productive.
For a start, those forced out of the labour market in recent years are
unlikely to describe themselves as elderly. The incidence of long-term
unemployment among workers older than 55 is generally about five times
higher than among youths.
It also reinforces the stereotypical image of whingeing old gits:
conjuring up a society where people over a certain age form the
curmudgeonly opposition to the productive young does little to counter
much received opinion in an advanced capitalist society which
increasingly means moving into the deceleration lane at 40. It's a
dangerous equation: old equals workless equals worthless. It is posited
purely on economic worth.
That said, the report is illuminating in its analyses of structural
changes in labour markets in industrialised countries and how older
workers were squeezed out. Since the mid-seventies, young people have
been encouraged to stay in education longer and older workers given
incentives to retire early, so reducing the labour supply at both ends.
As unemployment became more acute, a variety of schemes was introduced
in several countries to encourage older workers to retire early. There
was a substantial lowering of average retirement ages in many countries,
like Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands.
A series of ILO studies show ample evidence of how older workers were
used as a balancing factor to regulate labour supply. Why then, it asks,
were older workers so often the first victims of restructuring?
As the report illustrates, one explanation is their relatively higher
financial cost to the employer. Higher salaries, seniority rights,
fringe benefits, outdated skills and lower productivity were used as
excuses for ushering or ejecting older workers out of the back door of
the labour market.
But the report reinforces the point that while it may be true that
older workers cost more to employ, there is no reason to believe their
performance and the value of their accumulated know-how does not
compensate for the higher cost.
The fallacy that early retirement schemes made room for the young
unemployed is exploded. The total impact of such measures in Belgium,
France, Spain, and the UK, on youth unemployment was negligible. The
main beneficiaries of such schemes were companies, and a good proportion
of the costs fell on governments or taxpayers. Now, the report says,
practically all public early-retirement incentive schemes have been
abandoned because of the high costs.
The report points out that many older workers were put under pressure
to retire, or be laid off. Those forced to retire often feel excluded
from active society, their health may suffer, and they are often unable
to adjust to the new status.
The backlash against ageism, though, appears to have begun. Almost all
researchers and policy-makers now agree that the early-retirement trend
has gone too far and will have very serious long-term consequences if it
is not reversed in the near future.
The report points out that public pension spending, as a proportion of
GDP more than doubled average share between 1960 and 1984 to become the
largest single item in the budgets of most industrialised countries.
Further pressure on pension spending will begin to increase in the
first decade of the next century when the ''baby boom'' generation, born
after the Second World War, hits retirement. Some experts predict it
should be possible to meet the cost of further rises in social spending,
provided a certain level of economic growth can be maintained and no
other factors intervene. But many fear the social burden to be borne by
the economies will affect competitiveness and reduce prospects for
economic growth.
Some hitherto unpalatable options to tackle the problem are explored:
given the changing age structure of the population, says the report, it
might be possible to shift allocations from that targeted at the young
-- such as education -- to the needs of the elderly.
Reducing benefits, with the consequent serious social consequences, is
another option, while raising taxes or pensions contributions is
acknowledged as politically difficult.
''An important consideration is that pension systems are based on
inter-generational solidarity, where pensions of the retired are paid by
the working population which in turn will have pensions paid by future
generations.
''If the working population shrinks, as it has done, because of the
decline in participation rates and reduction in the number of young
entrants to the jobs market, the contributions and tax bases will be
considerably reduced.'' Thus many see a fiscal crisis looming.
In exploring solutions, the report concludes that the preferred option
among policy-makers might be to encourage more flexible relationships
between employment and retirement. This could mean basing entitlement to
a full pension on the number of years of contribution instead of the
worker's age, thus giving workers more flexibility in planning their
lives and careers.
But it points to the most important step in reversing the early
retirement trend which is to convince employers they have something to
gain by retaining or hiring older workers.
The report says that the latest research shows that training older
workers is beneficial because they are more receptive and attentive.
Many companies have made positive efforts to recruit older workers, such
as:
* British Airways' programme to employ older engineers to train young
workers.
* Tesco who took on 5000 workers aged between 55 and 70 under its
Mature Entrant Programme. It found older workers were more reliable,
needed less training, and were a stabilising influence on younger
workers.
* B&amp;Q which staffed entire stores with workers over 50 years old, and
found that they were capable, competent, and excellent at providing good
standards of customer service.
Empirical research has shown that because of longer experience, older
workers find ways to compensate for deficiences and often still
outperform younger workers. They may be less suited to jobs needing
speed, but more suited than many young people for jobs requiring
service, accuracy, skill, and routine.
In 30 years' time, according to the report, there will be only 1.5
economically active people for each ageing dependant in Western Europe.
The number of older people is increasing dramatically. Worldwide the
numbers will be staggering -- 1.2 billion people of 60 years or older.
''If retirement systems don't change before that happens, government
welfare and social security systems could collapse,'' warns Gisela
Schneider, who is the ILO's labour expert on ageing.
But before we start making a drama out of a demographic crisis,
invoking the hobbling menace of an age war, it would be as well to
remember that projections about population trends are often confounded
by real life.
Ever since Malthus, demographers have been worrying away at population
forces. Their projections usually turn out to be wrong. The latest
demographic scare facing the industrialised world might be confounded by
the players pushed out of the contracting labour market. The report
points out they are increasing their influence on the political scene
and raising their demands:
''A new identity of senior citizen is emerging, carrying with it
notions of empowerment gained through numbers and common status. They
are a force to be reckoned with.''
Senior citizens of the world unite: you have nothing to lose but your
stereotype.
The fallacy that early retirement schemes made room for the young
unemployed is exploded

AFICIONADOS of the boxing ring wait in hope for the moment when one
contestant, seeing his opponent's chin uncovered, releases the perfect
upper cut and sends him sprawling to the canvas.
It doesn't always happen. Many contests look like brawls with no
spectacular action.
So do many, indeed most, of the twice-weekly Commons duels -- about
five minutes rather than 15 rounds -- between the Prime Minister and
Leader of the Opposition. Just now and again, you get a knock-down.
Yesterday was such a day.
Mr Blair had the equivalent of a weight and reach advantage. The Tory
Euro- rebels had been offered back the party whip, withdrawn after their
Maastricht defection, without conditions. Stern words about them having
to work their passage back to the fold by unfailing obedience were
swallowed in the Tories' pressing need to look at least externally
united and for the Government to recover the Commons majority it had,
almost unthinkingly it seemed, thrown away by expelling them.
It was a situation for a Leader of the Opposition to savour. Had Mr
Major even secured from them a promise that in any future vote of
confidence on Europe they would support the Prime Minister, whose
parliamentary party they had just rejoined, Mr Blair queried.
Determined not to be pinned in a corner, Mr Major had prepared his
counter- attack. Labour had its divisions on Europe, he charged, and, in
a flurry of punches, gave examples.
With good judgment, Mr Blair saw the path clear for his killer punch.
''There is one big difference. I lead my party; you follow yours.''
Most of the Parliamentary Labour Party gave excellent imitations of
fight fans who have seen their man knock down the opposition. They
cheered, laughed and waved order papers.
Few political assertions are completely true, but Mr Blair's was
certainly close enough to the truth yesterday to hurt desperately his
opponent. He was the man who had decided to sweep away archaic Clause 4,
take on the union barons on the left, accomplish a dizzying number of
policy U-turns and had been rewarded with record- breaking opinion poll
leads.
His opponent was presiding over one of the most accident-prone of
Governments decisively rejected by the voters whenever an electoral
opportunity arose in the last three years and incapable of drawing a
line under the disasters and leading them on the way back.
Mr Blair's slogan could prove a durable one -- another misconception,
as the Tories see it, they will have to struggle to remove from the
public mind -- Blair strong: Major weak. The party can't let that one
take root.
Obeying the first law of politics that you kick a man when he is down
to make sure he stays down, Mr Blair reminded Mr Major cruelly how he
had scorned the notion of party unity through appeasement and told him,
''The white flag flies over Downing Street.''
What Mr Major certainly is is dogged. He got back to the despatch box
in the shape of a fighter who has just managed to rise on the count of
nine, physically on his feet but politically still on the canvas.
His Government led Europe while Mr Blair would follow Europe. It is
possible Mr Major still believes he is leading Europe. It is just that
it is difficult to find anyone beyond a portion of his party -- not
including the returning rebels -- who believe it, too.
Flailing courageously, he said Mr Blair's idea of the Red Flag was the
white flag on every European issue. Mr Blair brushed this away. If he
seriously thought he led his party, he should look at his colleagues
below the gangway, Mr Major tried, this time failing even to connect.
The bench below Labour's gangway used to be the haunt of rebels who
could send a shiver of apprehension up the spine of Labour leaders. Now,
with due respect to Mr Dennis Skinner, they are somewhat less terrifying
than the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's.
Mr Blair has told us that among the few things he admires about Lady
Thatcher is her determination and her willingness to take risks. Most of
his party won't mind him copying her there or her record of three
General Elections -- all won.

A JOINT plan by the privately-owned Bishopbriggs Golf Club and
building contractors Luddon Construction, to fill in an area on the golf
course affected by flooding, was rejected by Strathkelvin District
Council's planning committee last night.
The decision will be heralded as a victory for more than 1000 local
residents who signed a petition objecting to the plan. The council's
planning director, Mr Richard Dent, had also opposed the proposal on the
grounds that access to the site was considered ''inadequate''.
Mr Ian Weir, a past captain of the golf club which has about 600
members, said after last night's meeting: ''We are very, very
disappointed about the misinformation that was put out by people opposed
to the plan. We will just have to take stock and see what happens
next.''
Councillor Charles Kennedy, leader of the Labour-controlled local
authority, said: ''The feeling of the council, with the exception of one
member, was very strongly against the proposal.
''Infilling the site would have involved lorries carrying a
considerable amount of material coming through a fairly dense, built-up
area from morning until quite late in the day.''

THE mother of a boy who was badly burned when an oil drum exploded,
showering him with blazing fuel, yesterday settled a #25,000 damages
claim out of court.
Craig Lawson received severe burns to his face, left ear, an arm, and
shoulder. He underwent skin grafts and corrective surgery but has been
left with scarring and a permanent deformity to his ear.
His mother said he had been left with a fear of fires and avoids going
out in public because he fears people are staring at him.
The boy, who was five at the time of the accident in 1990, was with
his father, Craig, at a demolition site in Glasgow, collecting scrap
metal.
His mother Julie, now of Keats Way, Loughborough, Leicestershire,
raised an action against the demolition firm at the Court of Session,
claiming the accident was caused by its negligence.
The company, Burnfield Builders and Demolishers, of Sannox Gardens,
Glasgow, denied responsibility, blamed the boy's father for the
accident, and brought him into the court action as a third party.
The firm was carrying out demolition work for Glasgow District Council
at a site in Wellshot Road in the city, and waste was being burned on
the rubble-strewn site.
A large 45-gallon drum containing diesel oil was also on the
demolition site close to the fire when the accident occurred.
Mr Lawson and a friend, Mr James Kelly, went to the site with his son
intending to collect scrap.
In her action, Mrs Lawson said the three had been given permission to
take away scrap metal by a night watchman. While they were searching for
scrap, the metal drum caught light and exploded, sending burning fuel
over her son.
She claimed the boy was under reasonable supervision of his father and
Mr Kelly at all times.
However, the demolition firm said it employed a security firm at the
site, which was fenced. It said Mr Lawson and the other man went on to
the site without permission from a security guard.
The company said Mr Lawson decided to take the child on to a dangerous
demolition site and failed to ensure that his son was always beside him.
It alleged the boy started to play with the drum and rolled it on to the
fire.

UNION leaders at the ICI plant in Ardeer, Ayrshire, called yesterday
for more investment as company workers in the rest of the UK demanded a
''substantial'' pay rise.
Their demand follows the announcement that ICI pre-tax profits were up
84% last year and that executives received ''huge'' pay increases with
bonuses of 40%. Profits at the company soared to #514m in 1994, before
restructuring costs, from #280m the previous year.
However, Ardeer-based Noble's Explosives Company -- an ICI subsidiary
-- is under threat of closure. The long-term future of the site was put
in doubt when it was announced the manufacture of initiating systems --
detonators -- was to be phased out with the loss of 200 jobs by October.
The company said the demand for explosives was falling with the demise
of coal mining but unions said they would fight for the 600-strong
workforce.
Mr Harry O'Neil, district secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' union, said: ''Ardeer can survive only if ICI were prepared to
invest. We'll contact colleagues at other ICI sites to strengthen
opposition.''
White collar union MSF, which represents 10,000 ICI staff, said
''huge'' pay rises for executives should be matched for employees. ICI
executive directors were paid cash bonuses worth 40% of their salaries
in 1994, the maximum allowable under the earnings-related scheme.
Chief executive Sir Ronnie Hampel received a #170,000 bonus, taking
his total pay and benefits package to #607,000, while chairman Sir Denys
Henderson had #125,000 under the scheme, taking his total to #493,000.
MSF members at ICI received a 3% pay rise last year.
MSF also wants improved conditions, including 10 days' paternity leave
and improved maternity pay.
The union's national officer, Mr Paul Talbot, said: ''ICI have had a
record year. The bosses have done very well for themselves and now the
staff deserve their share.''
Shop steward Ian Gibb said last night: ''I believe that if ICI do not
invest in the site, those businesses which remain will be in severe
jeopardy and will eventually close.''
Nobel's Explosives company, which is a subsidiary of ICI, includes
several manufacturing units at Ardeer, making detonators, detonating
cord, plastic igniter cord, and explosives.

It's time to nobble all your old conceptions about the
kneecap -- it's now become an erogenous zone,
thanks to a new range of hosiery that for sheer
audacity takes the breath away. Anne Simpson reports
SEASONAL whims and personal predilections may shift erogenous zones
about a bit, but the allure of legs is eternal. Of course, legs in
fashion make sound commercial sense, many millionaires having turned a
pretty penny from the stocking and the sock. Now, with prevailing slits
breezing the dropped hemline and the mini simultaneously riding high,
hosiery manufacturers are up to their own dimpled kneecaps in success.
But it is a funny joint, the kneecap, nobbling its way to prominence
yet still hailed as one of the sexiest little knuckles in the anatomy of
seduction. Yet look at it. Much depends on whose leg it caps, but even
on the best of pins its bald appeal is not much better than the elbow,
and whoever saw eroticism in that?
No, it is the fact that the kneecap leads somewhere which gives it
that special appeal. Even so, that immortal autocrat, Chanel, hated the
sight of it so much she barred the kneecap's appearance from every one
of her collections. How she must detest what Karl Lagerfeld does to
hemlines in her name? Now that fashion's kaiser rules her salon, hemline
heresy is the short of it, the skirts on his Chanel suits fitting over
no more than the buttocks, like a cosy.
Chanel's attempts at kneecap prohibition didn't carry much weight,
however. Even in the twenties -- as soon as the Charleston hit the dance
floor -- women seeking to maximise its scatty frenzy, forsook veiled-leg
discretion and hoisted their petticoats and everything else
scandalously.
Off and on, fashion has exposed the kneecap ever since. But where this
was once good news only for those whose shapely pins stood on the right
side of the generation gap, the leg show now need not be hindered by
anything so touchy as the wearer's date of birth. Step and dance
sessions and the gymnasium are all age-levellers today, but equally the
contouring nature of opaque hose works to elegant advantage. Because of
its Lycra grip, the limbs beneath a mini can appear sinuous in solid
black, suggesting that the fashionable woman has long legs, aristocratic
ankles, and kneecaps of delicate definition.
But what happens when springtime's paler clothes require a lighter
step? The Princess of Wales has made it acceptable to wear sheer black
stockings with a pink suit, but the pearly shimmer and shine of the new
season's stockings also possess enough stretch and support to make the
best of any leg.
Talk of stockings inevitably leads to stocking tops, which originally
took up where garters left off, and later became hooked on suspenders
when the garter finally fell. Just now the lacy rim is the thing holding
fast of its own accord above the most translucent deniers, and peeping
out beneath sexy little slip dresses, trim satin skirts and the cutest
smalls of the moment -- tap dancer's shorts.
However, in the new leg show the shape and height of shoes demand
attention. Patent leather in the colours of crystallised fruits, and
sandals composed of diamante straps, satin ribbons or simple thongs rise
above themselves on thrusting stilettoes, the frequent footnote to all
this satin, whatever its length. But, for those with no sole for
heights, there are also plenty of cool Roman sandals and some gorgeous
flats, recalling Arabic slippers. These twinkle under gauzy trousers,
gleam at the far end of the mini, or creep in and out of the airy folds
of voile or chiffon fluttering round the ankle. Coated in panne velvet,
or loaded with sparkle, these are pumps which stand comparison with the
baffies of that old warrior dandy, Suleiman the Magnificent.
* All hose available from Manjoy department stores.

<HEADLINE>Stewart attacks Crown Office over 'guidance' on Lockerbie</HEADLINE>

FORMER Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart yesterday angrily
criticised the Crown Office over recent guidance it allegedly gave to
the Government over the Lockerbie affair.
The issue was raised in the Commons committee considering the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Bill by Linlithgow Labour MP Tam Dalyell.
He said he had received through the post a document, apparently from
the Crown Office, providing background to Scottish Office Minister Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton for a debate in which Mr Stewart put forward the
proposal that Scottish courts should be allowed to sit outside Scotland
to try the two Libyans accused of the bombing.
The document said: ''Mr Stewart has strong associations, partly
through his constituency, with the Asian business community in the West
of Scotland and has taken a keen interest in the Lockerbie case and in
the effect of sanctions on business with Libya.''
It also referred to Mr Stewart's visit to Libya earlier this month,
stating that he spent a week ''pursuing with such Libyan Government
officials as he could meet the question of whether Libya would
co-operate with such a trial.''
It said press reports ''indicated'' he had met Colonel Gaddafi,
whereas it is well known that Mr Stewart did indeed meet the Libyan
leader.
Mr Stewart said he had not received a copy of the memo, but he accused
the Crown Office of going ''well over the top,'' and said he would
support Mr Dalyell in his actions over the matter. Mr Dalyell already
has written to the Speaker.
Mr Stewart, MP for Eastwood, said that from his ministerial experience
he was pretty sure the document was genuine and was part of the
procedure whereby the purpose and background of a particular proposal
was set out for the Minister concerned.
On this occasion, however, Mr Stewart said the Crown Office document
clearly was suggesting some kind of impropriety on his part.
He said: ''It suggests that I had some financial association with the
Asian business community in the West of Scotland which I do not have.
''It is also seeking to rubbish the trip I made, during which I met
the Foreign Minister, the Education Minister, the chairman of the
European-Arab Investment Company -- which controls investment of $4bn --
and Gaddafi himself.
''This raises questions about the objectivity of the Crown Office and
my guess is that the document was leaked to Mr Dalyell by someone in the
Crown Office who is disaffected by the whole way in which this case is
being handled.''
Mr Stewart's proposal was rejected by the Government when it was
debated on April 20, with Lord James stating it would not advance the
position in the Lockerbie case but would lead only to confusion. He said
yesterday he stood by what he had said in the debate which had been
''worked out carefully in my own mind.''

THE dispatch of Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley to Perth on
Friday to counter the address of Mr Paddy Ashdown at the Scottish
Liberal Democrat conference was condemned yesterday as ''gutless,''
given the Tories' refusal to call a date for the local by-election.
''It is rich of the Tories to send a Minister to campaign in a
by-election for which they haven't yet had the guts to call a date,''
said Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace last night.
As Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown rises to his feet at Perth
City Halls, Mr Lilley will be five minutes into a visit to Upper
Springlands residential home for the handicapped in the city, before
going on to see cancer patients at Macmillan House and then holding a
news conference.
The engagements appeared to be health-related, rather than having
direct relevance to Mr Lilley's social security remit.
In any event they were intimated via Scottish Conservative Central
Office, and this brought the accusation that the Tories were
electioneering before they even had the courage to call a date for the
by-election in Perth and Kinross.
Mr Ashdown -- whose speech the engagements appear to be timed to
counter -- deferred to his party's strongly federal structure yesterday
and left the hostile comment to Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Mr
Wallace.
Speaking from Orkney, where he is recovering from flu, Mr Wallace
said: ''It must be a measure of the Tories' desperation that they felt
obliged to import Peter Lilley of all people to attempt to distract
attention from the SLD conference in Perth.
''However, Mr Lilley might make some useful contribution during his
visit if he can explain to the thousands of invalided Scots why they are
losing benefit under his new regulations.
''I doubt if he will be able to offer any hope for the 25% of children
in Scotland who now live in households dependent on income support.''

THE popularity of a television show and enticing images of Scotland
featured in a series of new movies are set to spark off a tourist boom
north of the Border.
Hotels are at their fullest for five years, with the Scottish Tourist
Board reporting a big response to BBC1's quirky police drama Hamish
Macbeth, which is filmed in Wester Ross.
Next month, the first of the films, Rob Roy, shot exclusively in
Scotland and starring Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange, will be premiered
in Edinburgh.
''We are waiting for the tourist onslaught when these films come out
and we've already had a lot of calls from people overwhelmed by the
scenery in Hamish Macbeth,'' said Scottish Tourist Board spokesperson,
Mrs Geraldine Bell.
Due out next autumn is Brave Heart, a film about Scots hero William
Wallace, played by Mel Gibson.
Next year, Ted Danson and Joely Richardson star in a film about, and
shot at, Loch Ness.
Also set for release in 1996 is Mary Reilly, a film based on a Robert
Louis Stevenson book set in Edinburgh's Old Town and starring Julia
Roberts and Glenn Close.
A detailed report published yesterday by the Royal Bank of Scotland
and the Scottish Tourist Board said that between October and December
last year the number of people staying in hotels rose by more than 10%
compared with the same period in 1993.
This figure was the highest for five years, sparking confidence in the
coming summer season.
However, while the majority of large hoteliers seemed confident of an
improvement in business this year, bed and breakfast and guest house
owners were gloomy.
According to the Royal Bank of Scotland economist, Mr Gerry Mullan,
most expected a decline in business after a bad year last year.
He said that, while large operators had seen an increase in the number
of overseas package-tour visitors, independent visitors appeared to be
eschewing the humble B&amp;B in favour of the higher quality accommodation.
The report pointed out that the flow of overseas tourists depended on
exchange rates. While Scotland is a relatively cheap destination for
Europeans, it is more expensive for Americans.
* The Lochdubh featured in the TV series Hamish Macbeth has a role
model in Lochdhu -- the spelling is slightly different but it still
means black loch in Gaelic.
Lochdhu Lodge is described as a baronial mansion, 110 miles north as
the crow flies from the West Coast village of Plockton, the fictional
Lochdubh's setting in the BBC Scotland series.
Now its owners, racing tipster, Mr Kevin Booth, from
Newcastle-on-Tyne, and weatherman, Mr Jim Dale, from High Wycombe in
Buckinghamshire, have put their remote lodge up for rental for
get-away-from-it-all holiday breaks.
Both aged 34 and fathers-of-three, they bought the century-old
building, complete with the laird's title, two years ago.
The lodge, restored at a cost of more than #100,000, with its
four-storey tower, is one of the most remote habitations in Britain.
Vehicle access across the peat moors of the Caithness Flow country is
by a 15-mile private track.
Billed as an ''inspirational paradise for those wishing to get away
from it all'', the reborn splendour of the lodge, which is set in 25
acres and comes complete with its own nearby trout loch, can cater for
up to fourteen people.
Mr Dale said yesterday: ''People can become the Laird of Lochdhu for a
week by renting the Lodge.
''We have just started advertising the lets but already there is keen
interest in the place, with a number of firm bookings already.''
He added: ''And I suppose that the new-found fame of the fictional
place with the same-sounding name in the Hamish Macbeth TV series will
not do us any harm.''

<HEADLINE>Progress over IRA's weapons is main aim as Ancram prepares to meet Sinn Fein.  Bruton invites Ulster leaders to talks</HEADLINE>

IRISH Premier John Bruton yesterday asked Northern Ireland's political
leaders to join him in historic all-party talks in a fresh bid by Dublin
to quicken the developing peace process.
The initiative came as Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram
prepared for critical discussions with Sinn Fein in Belfast next week.
Meanwhile, the outlawed Irish National Liberation Army claimed that,
far from being the last terror group to declare a truce, it actually
called a ceasefire last August, a month before the IRA.
The unexpected INLA announcement came at a court hearing in Dublin
where four men appeared on firearms charges.
However, it failed to convince sceptical loyalists, and Defence
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, in the Province to meet soldiers yesterday,
said the Army would stay in Northern Ireland for as long as terrorist
arsenals remain in place.
Mr Rifkind said the paramilitaries had retained the capability to
revert to terrorism and added: ''The need for a security presence is
very, very important and we have to take that into account.''
Mr Bruton told the Irish Parliament that his invitation to talks would
be extended to all parties, including Sinn Fein and loyalist
representatives with close links with the loyalist paramilitaries. There
would be an open agenda and no item excluded, he said.
He confirmed that decommissioning IRA weapons will figure in Mr
Ancram's talks with Sinn Fein but added: ''There are many other issues
that are relevant and I would not wish to say that one item is central
-- all are important.
''Without progress on arms, there will not be progress on others. But
equally, for there to be progress on arms, there are many other issues
on which there will have to be progress as well,'' he warned.
However, according to the Government the only topic for discussion
when Mr Ancram meets Sinn Fein will be moves toward getting rid of the
IRA's vast supply of guns and explosives.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary said there would be
no question of Sinn Fein taking part in substantive talks on the future
of Northern Ireland until ''substantial'' progress had been made on
weapons.
''Sinn Fein have got to divest themselves of what has disqualified
them in the past, namely, their association with a party (the IRA) that
has used violence for political purposes and that is still sitting on a
very large armaments pile,'' Sir Patrick said.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams claimed no agenda had been set in
advance of the Goverment's decision to go ahead with the meeting,
probably at Stormont some time next week, but discussions will include
the arms issue.
However, Mr Adams, who is due to leave for the United States early
next month and is unlikely to take part in the ministerial talks, said
he was concerned that pre-conditions were being placed on his party.
It was wrong for Sir Patrick to insist that future dialogue hinged on
progess over ''decommissioning'', he said.
''I hope Patrick Mayhew is not going to put himself on another hook
having just got himself off the earlier hook.
''We are entering into these discussions to be assured by Mr Ancram
that they (the Government) not only acknowledge but fully recognise the
rights of Sinn Fein voters -- that is what this is all about.''
Labour's Shawdow Northern Ireland Minister Mo Mowlam, also in Northern
Ireland yesterday, and urged Tory back benchers not to let the arms
issue wreck the process.

SIX senior officials are in contention for the biggest job in the
reorganised Scottish local government set-up.
The #96,000-a-year post of chief executive of the new City of Glasgow
Council attracted 20 applicants but a short leet of six was drawn up by
senior councillors following the authority's inaugural meeting
yesterday.
They are: Mr John Anderson, Depute Chief Executive, Strathclyde
region; Mr Tom Monaghan, Town Clerk, Glasgow district; Dr John Markland,
Chief Executive, Fife region; Mr David Comley, Director of Housing,
Glasgow district; Mr Alastair MacNish, Depute Director of Social Work,
Strathclyde region; and Mr Douglas Sinclair, Chief Executive, Central
region.
With the new authority due to assume full powers next April, council
leaders are anxious to have senior appointments made early.
Mr Anderson and Mr Monaghan appear to be the leading contenders, with
the selection panel having to choose between regional council and
district council expertise.
Earlier, Councillor Jean McFadden was installed as convener of the
shadow council, and afterwards called on the new councillors to ensure
that the transition from two-tier to a unitary council was ''seamless''.

LEADERS of the second largest Labour Party affiliate, the GMB general
union, yesterday lined up behind Labour leader Tony Blair's proposed
rewrite of the party constitution, which now is set to win overwhelming
backing at Saturday's special party conference.
The GMB executive of 83 members voted heavily to support ditching
Clause 4, the party's historic commitment to nationalisation, and
replace it with a new statement of aims and values.
GMB will now cast its 12.1% vote for Mr Blair -- and this, along with
the votes of the AEEU (8.7%), the shopworkers' union Usdaw (4.8%), the
Communications Workers Union (4.5%) and a host of smaller moderate
unions should ensure the Labour leader of majority support within the
union section, which has 70% of the total vote.
With constituencies voting overwhelmingly in favour of change, Mr
Blair's supporters believe victory is guaranteed.
Britain's two biggest unions, Unison and the Transport and General
Workers' Union which between them control 25% of the conference votes,
are opposed to a new Clause 4, although the TGWU delegation will meet on
Saturday morning and could yet decide to swing its 14% behind Mr Blair.
The GMB executive members decided to support the Labour leader after a
two-hour meeting in London had considered the results of extensive
consultation among the union's 790,000 levy-paying members.
General secretary John Edmonds said the very strong feeling among the
membership was that Mr Blair should be supported at this weekend's
special conference in order to give him a good basis for contesting the
General Election ''which cannot come too quickly''.
Asked whether the rewording of Clause 4 satisfied his demand for a
commitment to full employment, Mr Edmonds homed in on the phrase
''opportunity for all to work and prosper'' as evidence of such a
commitment, which he hoped eventually would be followed by a policy
statement.
* Labour last night reported that latest results from the constituency
parties who had balloted members over Clause 4 showed 374 in favour of
the change and just three against.
Embarrassingly for the leadership, one of those against was Glasgow
Garscadden, seat of Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar, and
another was Jarrow, constituency of deputy chief whip Don Dixon.
The third was Walsall North, represented by senior backbencher David
Winnick.

THE Prime Minister yesterday reaffirmed his support for the
introduction of identity cards to fight fraud and crime.
Mr Major told the Commons at Question Time: ''I believe there are
significant advantages identity cards may offer to prevent crime and
fraud.''
He said Home Secretary Michael Howard would publish a green paper
setting out various options.
''No option at the moment is ruled in or ruled out, until we have
completed that consultation period.''
Plans for identity cards have stirred fierce opposition from within
the Conservative Party, including some Euro-rebels.
However, Mr Major swept aside their concerns and restated his firm
belief in them when the issue was raised by Tory former Minister Alan
Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon).
Mr Howarth said: ''Do you agree that the Conservative Party has
traditionally and rightly been loath to allow power to the state that
could be used to limit personal freedom unduly, to harass or intrude on
privacy.
''The alleged benefits of introducing identity cards would not justify
the risks to civil liberties and would you dismiss proposals for a
national identity card whether compulsory or so-called voluntary.''
Mr Major told him: ''I am afraid on this issue I cannot agree with
you.''
Mr Howard would publish a green paper because of the advantages cards
could offer in the fight against crime.
''When we have consulted, we will make a decision on whether to
proceed and what nature of card we may then seek to introduce.''

MORE than 3000 profoundly deaf children and adults could benefit from
cochlear implants on the National Health Service, after new research
showing that they are safe and effective, the Government disclosed
yesterday.
Junior Health Minister Baroness Cumberlege said that the operation
cost the NHS #21,000 per adult and #24,000 per child, with subsequent
annual costs of #1000 per adult and #2000 per child.
Among the 15 centres she listed as carrying out cochlear implants were
Edinburgh and Kilmarnock.
Labour's Lord Ashley of Stoke, whose hearing was partially restored by
an implant, described the treatment as a ''medical miracle which rescues
totally deaf people from the world of silence''.

THE Prime Minister yesterday condemned the use of the word ''nigger''
by comedian Bernard Manning.
Mr Major said at Commons Question Time that people should avoid
expressions giving offence to those on the receiving end, and this was
''true of Mr Manning and everyone else''.
The Prime Minister was replying to Labour MP Ken Livingstone, MP for
Brent East, who raised reports of a police charity night in Manchester
featuring the comedian.
Mr Livingstone urged Mr Major to ''condemn the use of the word
'nigger' by the comedian Bernard Manning'' and to endorse the comments
of Greater Manchester chief constable David Wilmot ''that this was a
vile, racist performance and he would rather that nobody among his force
went to further performances by Bernard Manning''.
To Labour cheers, Mr Livingstone called on the Prime Minister to write
to the comedian ''and remind him that such views, in the year in which
we commemorate the sacrifice our parents made to defeat Nazism, are
particularly offensive''.
Mr Major replied: ''I certainly think that everybody should avoid
expressions that give offence to those who are on the receiving end of
those expressions -- and I believe that is true of Mr Manning and
everyone else.''

CAMPAIGNERS have stepped up their fight against a proposal, by the
wife of Dundee FC's chairman, for a wind farm on the Kintyre peninsula,
claiming it would create an eyesore in an area of natural beauty.
A petition opposing the application to build the farm at Ballygroggan,
near Machrihanish, is to be passed to Argyll and Bute District Council
today. The plan is one of four involving wind farms on the peninsula.
The applicant, Mrs Joan Dixon, is the local landowner and wife of
Canadian millionaire and Dundee chairman, Mr Ron Dixon. She submitted
the application to erect 29 wind turbines last year. Council planners
are due to consider the proposals at a committee meeting in June.
Objectors claim the farm would create:
* An eyesore and environmental damage in an area of outstanding
natural beauty.
* Noise levels equivalent to a pneumatic drill at 15ft.
* A disturbance to migratory birds and to flora and fauna.
* Heavy lorry traffic to and from the site.
* Loss of television reception for locals.
They add that there would be no benefit to the local economy in terms
of permanent jobs revenue or rates income.
Mr Charles McMillan, a marine engineer who lives in Machrihanish and
helped organise the protest campaign, said the petition included several
hundred signatures.
He added that Mrs Dixon had predicted a noise level of 98 decibels at
Ballygroggan Farm. Literature from the Scottish Office says 100 decibels
is the equivalent of a pneumatic drill at 15ft.
Mrs Dixon's farm agent, Dr Simon Lawrence, said the wind turbines
would not have a serious effect on the area. He said the environmental
impact would be minimal and the windmills would be screened from most
angles. He added that building work would not last long and some jobs
may be created for local people.
A spokeswoman for the council said official policy was neither for nor
against wind farms. She said guidelines -- which include an assessment
of environmental factors, visual impact, and noise levels -- had been
drawn up to help planners consider applications on their individual
merits.
The other applications submitted to the council and due for
consideration are at Largie, Tayinloan; Tangy Farm, Kilchenzie; and
Ronachan Farm, Clachan.
Meanwhile, councillors in Shetland yesterday backed further research
into harnessing the power of the tides.
The council's development committee agreed to support a bid by
Heriot-Watt University and IT Power Ltd, for European funding to build a
prototype tide-mill.
Researchers from the university's International Centre for Island
Technology in Stromness, Orkney, say there are suitable sites in tide
races at the Falls of Warness in Orkney and Bluemull Sound, Shetland.

MOST women would happily turn their backs on the rat-race and settle
for a life of leisure, according to a nationwide survey published
yesterday.
More than three-quarters of all women (76%) feel they have ''too many
roles to perform nowadays'', with 25% feeling under stress most of the
time.
Fifty-four per cent questioned in the magazine survey said they felt
exhausted at least once a week and the same number suffered from
depression.
A third of all women think about death on a frequent basis.
If money was no object, 41% of women said they would rather be a
''woman of leisure'' and 33% would choose to be a ''home-maker''.
Only 26% would choose to be a career woman.
Ms Jane Garton, editor of Top Sante magazine, said: ''These findings
are particularly remarkable given that more than half of our national
survey sample currently hold down managerial or skilled jobs which they
have worked hard to obtain.''

THE Lewis-born hostage freed in Sierra Leone last week, is in hospital
suffering from malaria.
The news came as friends and relations in Mr Calum Murray's home
village of Gress were waiting to welcome him back yesterday.
One neighbour said tearfully: ''I just hope wee Calum's all right.
After everything he's been through, surely he's going to be all right.''
Voluntary Service Overseas spokeswoman Betty McBride said Mr Murray,
25, was in hospital only as a precaution.
''It's not unusual for returned volunteers to be diagnosed as having
malaria. It's very treatable but he's tired and we are taking every
precaution.''
Neither VSO nor the Foreign Office were prepared to say where Mr
Murray was being treated.
A spokesman for the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, part of University
College London, said he could not say if Mr Murray had been admitted.

THE lawyers acting for a man being sued by the parents of murdered
teenager Amanda Duffy have agreed to accept the writ which could lead to
a unique test case in the Scottish Courts.
Last night, a spokesman for Wishaw-based solicitors, Ness, Gallagher,
representing Mr Francis Auld, 21, said they had instructed their agents
in Edinburgh to accept a writ lodged by the Duffy's lawyers four weeks
ago.
Mr Joe Duffy and his wife Kate are suing Mr Auld in the Court of
Session for #50,000 for the ''loss of society'' of their daughter,
almost three years after a jury in the High Court in Glasgow returned a
verdict of not proven against him for her murder.
The Duffys made it known in May last year that they intended to raise
a civil action against Mr Auld, believing it was ''the only way
forward''. The couple expect the case to cost about #30,000 but are
hopeful of raising the money through ''hard- earned savings'' and a
public appeal fund set up in Hamilton last October.
Mr Peter Anderson, of Simpson and Marwick, solicitor for the Duffys,
confirmed on Monday that the civil action had begun and a summons had
been lodged in the Court of Session on March 24 intimating the intention
to seek damages of #50,000.
He said: ''I am waiting to hear back from solicitors representing Mr
Auld. If they don't accept the authorisation within the next day or two,
I will simply instruct court officers to deliver the writ directly to
him.''
Last night, he said the writ had been served on Mr Auld by delivering
it to Brodies -- Edinburgh agents for Ness, Gallagher.
A spokesman for Ness, Gallagher said they would be contacting Mr Auld
-- who is believed to be living in the North of England -- to receive
his response to the summons.

THE poll tax cost #1500m to set up and run in Scotland, Labour claimed
yesterday.
It said the cash could have doubled the current Scottish Office
education budget or wiped out Scotland's hospital waiting lists dozens
of times over.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said: ''The Tory
party claims to be the party of sound finance. They are in reality the
party of waste.
''Scots will never forgive the Tories for the poll tax and they will
never ever forget that they were used as guinea-pigs for this cruel and
wasteful experiment.''
Labour's claims are based on figures obtained from the Scottish Office
by Glasgow MP Mrs Maria Fyfe in the form of a written Parliamentary
answer.
These list the #127m cost of administering the collection of the flat
rate tax incurred between 1989/90 and 1992/93 when it was abolished.
The cost of implementing the tax was #21m, while #750m was spent on
central Government transitional grant and relief schemes.
This total of #898m was added to the #600m which Cosla says is still
outstanding in uncollected and unpaid poll tax.
However, the Scottish Local Government Minister, Mr George Kynoch,
insisted the figures were not new and had been in the public domain for
some time. He accused Labour of distorting them and of misleading the
public.
He said the #127m quoted for administering the tax was not an
additional cost.
He added that, unless the Labour Party had a magic formula up its
sleeve for a tax that cost nothing to collect, it had to admit that
every tax had to be administered and that cost money.
Of the #898m quoted as the cost of establishing the tax, Mr Kynoch
said #750m was returned to taxpayers in the form of rebates.

FORMER Conservative Party Treasurer Lord McAlpine unwittingly bought
part of a ''uniquely'' valuable treasure of stolen artefacts, a court
was told yesterday.
The peer, a well-known antiquities collector and dealer, later
received #55,000 from the British Museum for 20 rare miniature
decorative Iron Age shields up to 4000 years old.
Knightsbridge Crown Court in west London was told that what Lord
McAlpine did not know was that the items, and others which he had
purchased, were from a haul of around 500 pieces which allegedly were
stolen.
The sale to the museum aroused the suspicions of Dr Ian Stead, one of
the institution's deputy keepers, said Mr Jonathan Laidlaw, prosecuting.
Dr Stead then began a five-year investigation which led to the arrests
of Mr James Garriock, 42, and Mr Terrence Rossiter, 47, the two men who
originally unearthed the items in 1985. Coins and antiquities dealer Mr
John Cummings, 48, also was arrested.
Mr Garriock, a part-time gardener, and Mr Rossiter found the treasure
using metal detectors in a field near Salisbury, Wiltshire, owned by a
farmer, Mr Reginald Cook.
Mr Garriock, of Hazel Close, Salisbury, Wiltshire, and Mr Rossiter, of
Water Lane, Salisbury, both deny stealing the items from Mr Cook, who
died last year.
Mr Cummings, of Church Street, Foston, Grantham, Lincolnshire, has
denied handling the goods.
Mr Laidlaw told the jury that the case involved tools, weapons,
ornaments, and jewellery ''made and used by our ancestors'' up to 4000
years ago, which had become known as the Salisbury Hoard.
Within days of the find, Mr Garriock had approached Mr Cummings and
sold the ''vast majority'' of the collection to him for #10,500, he
said.
Of Mr Cummings's role, he alleged: ''One does not, if you are an
honest antiquities dealer, buy a hoard of this size and quality from
metal detectionists without ensuring or making proper inquiry as to
whether they were the proper owners of the goods.''
Mr Laidlaw said it was the Crown's case that neither Mr Garriock nor
Mr Rossiter had Mr Cook's permission to use metal detectors on his land.
Indeed, Mr Rossiter had found 13 silver coins on the site some years
earlier in another expedition undertaken without permission, he said.
However, after a dispute, the farmer had given Mr Rossiter the coins
in exchange for a written undertaking not to trespass on his land again.
Police discovered that some items of the hoard had been sold in New
York before being bought by the Devizes Museum. Others were bought by
dealer Maurice Brahm who, in turn, sold them to Lord McAlpine.
In 1988, three years after the original find, the Tory peer sold the
miniature shields to the British Museum.
It was then that Dr Stead began contacting dealers and archaeologists,
as rumours had begun to circulate about the Salisbury Hoard.
In 1992, Mr Garriock, posing as a man called John, contacted Dr Stead
offering to sell 10 items to the British Museum for #20,000. Eventually,
Dr Stead contacted the police.
The trial continues.

THE mother of death row Scot Kenny Richey has begged Prime Minister
John Major to intervene and help free her son from dying in the electric
chair in the United States.
Richey, 30, has been on death row in Ohio since February 1987 after
being found guilty of causing a child's death in an arson attack.
In a letter to Mr Major, his distraught mother Eileen, from Edinburgh,
wrote yesterday: ''I am writing to plead for your help with my son Kenny
who is the next Briton on death row in the USA to go to the electric
chair.
''I am at my wit's end and that is why I am begging you for any help
you can offer. My thoughts and prayers are with Kenny every day and I am
also praying that you can somehow free him and save him from the
chair.''
Sitting in her small flat with her two cats, Mrs Richey, 50, said the
letter was a last-ditch attempt to save her son. She said: ''I am asking
not just that he escapes the chair but that he is pardoned for a crime
he did not commit.
''I know John Major couldn't or wouldn't intervene to stop Nick
Ingram's execution but my son is innocent and should be freed
immediately. No parent should ever have to witness their flesh and blood
being electrocuted. It is inhumane and barbaric.
''If a Briton was given the death sentence in a Third World country
there would be an outcry. Why is our Government not concerned when it
happens in America?''
She was advised by her son's lawyer, Mr Clive Stafford Smith, who also
represented Ingram -- the first Briton to die in the chair in America on
April 6 -- to write the letter.
He told her that if Mr Major stepped in it could help her son's case
as he is running out of legal appeals, and time, after eight years on
death row.
In his last letter to his mother, Richey wrote: ''I don't want to die
but if I have to I will to prove my innocence.
''I am proud to be British and when the time comes I will not disgrace
my family or country by meeting it like a coward.
''I will go with my head held high, with pride and dignity, knowing
that I died an innocent man.''
Incredibly, Mrs Richey has another tragedy to face. She has a second
son, Tom, who is serving 65 years in Washington state for gunning down
two shop assistants while he was serving in the American army.
His conviction came just three months after his brother was sentenced
to the chair for causing death by arson.
The court heard how in the early hours of June 30, 1986, in Columbus
Grove, Ohio, Kenny Richey tried to set fire to his former lover Candy
Barchet's apartment. She was sleeping in the apartment with her new
lover Mike Nichols.
The prosecutor said Richey was drunk and in a ''jealous, sociopathic
rage''. The apartment above, where toddler Cynthia Collins slept alone,
was set ablaze instead.
The prosecution said Richey doused the building in petrol in the full
knowledge that Collins was in the apartment.
Richey strongly denied the charges and despite evidence of the
apartment having faulty wiring he was found guilty.
The Scot has always claimed he is innocent while brother Tom admits
his guilt and he has written a book, Flashover, to help prove Kenny's
conviction is a miscarriage of justice.
Mrs Richey, born in Edinburgh, met and married her husband Jim who was
an American Air Force sergeant serving in the UK.
When the couple separated, he returned to America and the three boys
remained in Edinburgh with their mother until their late teens.
Hoping to find better career prospects, the boys moved to the United
States.
Using their father's American citizenship, Kenny Richey enlisted in
the Marines and Tom in the US Army Airborne Rangers.
Kenny was dishonourably discharged before his conviction and Tom was
serving as a gunnery soldier when he committed murder.
The worry of facing her son's death has taken its toll on her health
and Mrs Richey, a waitress for 18 years, is now unable to work and fears
going out on her own.
Mrs Richey is also worried that in the wake of the Oklahoma City
bombing public opinion in America will push death sentences through
quicker.
A spokesman for 10 Downing Street said: ''Mrs Richey's letter will be
given full consideration by the Prime Minister.''

EMPLOYEES of the Wood Group on board Shell's Brent Charlie and Delta
plaforms have voted overwhelmingly in favour of trade union
representation in a secret ballot organised by the workforce.
They also voted overwhelmingly in favour of being represented by the
OILC (Offshore Industry Liaison Committee) union.
The ballot was called following apparently growing discontent over
what the workforce say is a steady erosion of conditions.
The papers from the secret ballot were counted yesterday in front of
an independent adjudicator. Of the 364 ballot papers issued 349 were
returned and of these only three were opposed to union recognition. Of
the 346 in favour 292 named the OILC as the union they wanted to
represent them.
Last night Mr Ronnie McDonald, OILC general secretary, said the ballot
showed that although the issue of effective trade union representation
had not gone away.
Last night a Wood Group spokesperson said that the results of what
they described as an unofficial ballot had been received.
''Whilst we will consider these results we wish to restate our company
position in that our employees are free to join any bona fide union they
so wish, or equally not to join, '' she said.

HIGHLAND Regional Council yesterday launched its legal challenge
against British Rail's decision to close the West Highland sleeper
service.
In its action at the Court of Session, the region alleges that the
closure decision is illegal, irrational, and unreasonable and it accuses
BR of perpetrating a ''sham'' by planning to run ''ghost trains'' on
short stretches of line near Glasgow.
It is alleged that by introducing these late-night, one-way services
British Rail can claim the lines are still operational and avoid a
public inquiry.
The region also argues that the withdrawal of the sleeper service
between Fort William and London, which has operated since 1901, will
have a big impact on the area's economy.
BR announced its intention to discontinue the sleeper service from May
28 this year.
In its petition for judicial review of the closure decision, Highland
region accuses BR of trying to circumvent statutory closure procedures
required by the 1993 Railways Act.
It says BR is attempting to achieve this by providing late-night
one-way services on three stretches of track in the Glasgow area. For
example, one train will run between Maryhill (departing two minutes
before midnight) and Bishopbriggs.
Highland region argues that there has never been any passenger service
between Maryhill and Bishopbriggs and that the running of a service at
23.58 is ''of no conceivable use or benefit to the travelling public''.
The region alleges: ''The proposed new services between Maryhill and
Bishopbriggs, Greenhill Lower Junction and Cumbernauld, and Cumbernauld
and Glasgow are all shams designed to circumvent statutory safeguards.
''The decision to withdraw the West Highland sleeper services and
replace them with sham services is irrational and unreasonable.''
The region will ask a Court of Session judge to set aside the decision
to end the sleeper service and for an interdict banning its
discontinuation in the absence of statutory consultation over the three
stretches of Glasgow line.
It is also asking the court to declare that the proposed withdrawal of
the sleeper services amounts to the withdrawal of rail passenger
services over the sections of line in the Glasgow area under the 1993
Act.
No date has yet been set for a full hearing, although the case is
expected to be heard before the May 28 deadline.
Meanwhile, Railtrack has raised hopes of improvements to the line
north of Inverness, which could trim 20 minutes off the journey to
Caithness.
Its Scottish director, Mr Paul Prescott, is travelling north next
month to inspect two proposed new projects for which Railtrack could
potentially apply for European Objective One funding.
A Railtrack spokesman yesterday said a scheme to realign the track
approaching Georgemas -- to allow through trains from Thurso -- and
another to improve level crossings (at Marel, near Helmsdale, and
Bilbster, near Watten) will be looked at by Mr Prescott during his
visit.

MORE than 130,000 candidates have been presented for this year's
Standard Grade and Higher examinations, which begin on Friday.
However, if the body responsible for academic examinations for 16 to
18-year-olds has its way, the exam timetable will alter radically, in
line with the Government's blueprint for secondary schooling.
Acting on behalf of the strategy group responsible for the development
of the Higher Still reform, the Scottish Examination Board has produced
a consultative document proposing Higher exams, currently spread over
May and the first part of June, could in future be restricted to a
three-week period in June.
Under Higher Still, courses will be designed to last 160 hours,
compared with 120 hours at present.
Some extra teaching time to allow for the expansion can be found by
reducing the role of prelim exams through the wider use of
internally-assessed units -- a basic principle of Higher Still.
However, more teaching hours will have to be released if pupils are to
continue to take the same number of Highers. The board thinks this can
be best done by shortening the exam diet.
This year's exam presentations are 6.5% up on last year's.
Results are due to be issued early in August.

THE secretary of the James Connolly Society in Scotland yesterday
appealed to Loyalists to call a truce over a planned march in memory of
the Edinburgh-born Republican.
Loyalists immediately dismissed the call from Mr Jim Slaven and
pledged to oppose the Edinburgh march and rally. Mr Keith Rutherford, of
the Edinburgh Loyalist Coalition, said it was ''likely'' his group would
be taking action and would be considering their position over the next
few days.
The James Connolly Society has applied to hold a march on June 3 in
memory of the Republican and socialist who was executed for his part in
the Easter Uprising in 1916. The march has faced strong opposition from
Loyalist groups in the city on previous occasions.
Mr Slaven said he was ''hopeful'' permission would be given for the
march and for it to proceed free of trouble.
Supporters would march from King's Stables Road to a rally at the
Meadows.

A DRUNKEN passenger who grabbed the wheel of a car in which he was
being given a lift, causing the driver to plough into a group of
pedestrians, was found guilty yesterday of endangering the life of a
young Edinburgh undergraduate.
Student Thomas Leftwich, 20, received serious head injuries and was
left with impaired language ability and limited vocabulary, Stirling
Sheriff Court was told.
The court heard that Mr Leftwich, of Argyll Park Terrace, Edinburgh,
was walking home along Causewayhead Road, Stirling, with a group of
friends after an evening out in his parents' home town, when a car
carrying Alloa man Paul Landsborough came along.
Landsborough, who has a criminal record for violence, leaned over,
took hold of the steering wheel, and pulled it to the left.
Despite desperate braking by the driver, Mr John Thomson, the
Y-registration Ford Fiesta mounted the pavement, smashing into Mr
Leftwich, who slid off the bonnet with blood pouring from his ears.
Mr Leftwich said he could remember nothing but Mr Andrew Nicol, 18,
another of the group on the pavement, said he had jumped for his life as
the car swerved violently towards them. Mr Nicol said he had seen
Landsborough reach out for the wheel.
After the accident, around dawn on July 3, Mr Thomson, of Paton
Street, Alloa had looked shocked and kept saying: ''He pulled the wheel
. . . why did he do it, why did he do it?''
Somebody else -- the prosecution said it must have been Landsborough
-- was saying: ''I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I pulled the steering wheel for a
laugh.''
The jury found Landsborough, 30, of Woodburn Drive, Alloa, guilty by
majority of a charge culpable and reckless conduct.
The court was told that Landsborough had been unemployed since 1992,
when he was released after serving an 18-month sentence for assault to
severe injury.
On the night of the tragedy, he was in the front seat of the Fiesta
being given a lift home. He and former prison officer Mr Chris Binnie,
25, who was in the back seat had been drinking all night.
Landsborough claimed that some of the pedestrians had been on the
road, in the path of the car, and he had grabbed the wheel in panic.
Mr Thomson and Mr Binnie backed the tale but police expert Constable
Gregor Miles said there was no evidence of any collision on the road and
skid marks showed that the driver had gone into an emergency stop only
after the course of the car had been altered towards the pavement.
Deferring sentence for reports, Sheriff Robert Younger warned
Landsborough he could face jail.

THE insurers of the wrecked oil tanker Braer still owe Shetland
Islands Council #1.5m, it was claimed yesterday.
A council finance department spokesman said the International Oil
Pollution Compensation Fund, had ''resisted strongly making even an
interim payment'' on the claim submitted last summer.
''We have made our irritation known,'' he said. ''We will be lodging
our claim before a court, if the need arises, before the legal deadline
expires.''
He believed the time limit would be January 1996, three years after
the wreck which spilled 85,000 tonnes of oil on the south of Shetland.
During the Braer crisis, the council ran up extra bills for transport,
accommodation, food, telephones, faxes, an emergency response centre,
and the diversion of staff from their normal duties.
The spokesman said they had given the insurers ''inordinate amounts of
detail'' filling boxes of files. He added: ''They've had all they've
asked for. The ball's now in their court. Obviously we'll have to
reserve our legal position.''
Payments by the insurers to Shetland claimants have now passed #41m,
more than half to the seafood industry, but the council is not alone in
saying that it is still owed large sums.

INDUSTRY leaders in Scotland yesterday expressed outrage at the
prospect of Scottish Nuclear being merged with its much larger English
neighbour.
They warned of the ''devastating'' consequences for industrial
confidence, and the ''criminal'' loss which would be suffered by
Scotland's hi-tech engineering sector.
Mr Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Council
Development and Industry, said a merger would not only remove one of the
few remaining large companies with its headquarters in Scotland but
would have other important implications for Scotland's economic
well-being and the long-term future of the nuclear industry.
In a letter to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, he warned: ''Scottish
Nuclear includes a remarkably high concentration of qualified scientists
and engineers within its staff. The familiar experience of post-merger
rationalisation would decimate this important centre of scientific and
technical excellence to the great disadvantage of graduate employment in
Scotland.''
Since Scottish Nuclear's headquarters were in East Kilbride, he said,
comparisons were bound to be drawn with the lingering decline of the
National Engineering Laboratory, and the recently-announced closure of
the Rolls-Royce engine development laboratories in the same town.
''The effect on industrial confidence and public morale in North
Lanarkshire would be devastating,'' he said.
There was a further consideration, concerning the future of the
nuclear industry itself.
''Nuclear power generation is a relatively young technology which has
many years of innovation before it. The Scottish nuclear industry has a
distinctive and distinguished record.
''In both operations and innovation, the company compares very
favourably with its southern neighbour. It would be immensely damaging
to the development prospects of Britain's nuclear industry if this
competition through emulation was to be lost,'' he said.
The fight to retain a separate Scottish nuclear power industry has
also been backed by employers' organisation Scottish Engineering.
In a letter to The Herald, published today, chief executive Howard
Jordan states: ''Scottish Engineering is appalled that the Government
should even consider merging a strong Scottish company, which provides
1750 high-quality jobs and injects more than #100m a year into the
Scottish economy.
''We must take issue with those who plan to hijack one of our major
high-technology engineering institutions. The loss would be criminal.''

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang is set to come under increasing pressure
from MPs to push for the Scottish nuclear industry to be privatised as a
single entity and not merged with its English counterpart.
The issue will be raised at a meeting this evening with back-bench
Scottish Tory MPs and is likely to come up during the hour-long session
of Scottish Questions this afternoon.
The pressure on Mr Lang has been stepped up after the outspoken attack
by Sir Donald Miller, former chairman of ScottishPower, on the
possibility of a merger.
Mr Miller insisted it would be akin to a breach of faith by the
Government and another assault on Scottish institutions by a Whitehall
bureaucracy and London-based advisers insensitive to opinion north of
the Border.
The issue was raised at Prime Minister's Question Time yesterday by
Ayr Tory MP, Mr Phil Gallie.
He asked if Mr Major had seen the ''excellent'' report from Scottish
Nuclear which showed the cost of generation had been reduced to 2.2p per
unit, without the nuclear levy enjoyed by Nuclear Electric.
He went on: ''Do you not feel that if the Government was to think of
privatising the nuclear industry, Scottish Nuclear could do a
magnificent job as a single entity?''
Mr Major told him: ''We are very close to completion of the nuclear
review and an announcement about its conclusions will be made and a
White paper published as soon as possible. We will present our
conclusions to Parliament at that time.
''Privatisation of the two nuclear generators before the next election
is an option actively under consideration and so is the future of the
fossil fuel levy.''
His last comment was a reference to the levy paid by other electricity
generators to nuclear for processes such as decommissioning,
reprocessing, and storage of waste.
Downing Street was anxious to point out yesterday that the White Paper
referred to by the Prime Minister was unlikely to be published next week
and may not emerge for some weeks. Sources were not sure whether the
matter would be on the agenda for tomorrow's Cabinet meeting.
Mr Gallie said the meeting with Mr Lang had been arranged for some
time and it was made clear it was a regular contact between the Scottish
Secretary and back benchers about a range of issues.
Nevertheless, he said he and others would be arguing that Scottish
Nuclear's record was outstanding. He said: ''It is ahead of Nuclear
Electric in many ways with experience built up over many years.''
''As a Conservative, I believe that competition is important and
comparison is important. I think one of the lessons of British Gas is
that we would have been better off with more than one company
established from the outset. I think there are advantages in creating
two companies -- one south of the Border and one north.''
Another back bencher who will attend today's meeting, Tayside North
MP, Mr Bill Walker, said: ''I am firmly saying that one of the problems
we faced in the local elections is that we have not been seen to be
addressing the Scottish dimension.

<HEADLINE>Company unveils #150m net total and boosts defences against threatened takeover by English firm. Scottish Nuclear doubles profits</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Nuclear beefed up its defence against takeover by Nuclear
Electric yesterday, unveiling net profits more than doubled to #150m in
the year to March and sharply lower unit generating costs. At 2.2p per
kilowatt hour its suitor will be hard pushed to match these costs.
The most striking feature of the unaudited results is that Scottish
Nuclear is now profitable even after all hidden subsidies in its supply
agreements with ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric are stripped out.
The company says its without-subsidy profits were #31m last year on
sales of #580m and that these will continue to grow as on-line
refuelling at Torness and other efficiency measures make themselves
felt.
Scottish Nuclear does not have access to the nuclear levy enjoyed by
Nuclear Electric in England and Wales. Instead its long-term supply
contracts with the two privatised Scottish electricity companies include
an element of subsidy in the price to help pay for the decommissioning
of the Hunterston A Magnox station.
That subsidy element is reducing year-on-year and will be phased out
completely by 1998. But yesterday SN chairman James Hann said: ''Even
though the price we are being paid is falling over the next three years,
we expect underlying profits to increase.''
The sparkling results for the year to March were seized on by MPs
across the Commons who support Scottish Nuclear's battle to retain its
independence. The Tory MP for Ayr, Mr Phil Gallie, raised them at Prime
Minister's questions, and Labour's industry spokesman Mr Brian Wilson
used them to launch another attack on the whole privatisation plan.
''It is absolutely clear that privatisation is unwanted and
unnecessary,'' he said. ''The sole motivation for selling off nuclear
power stations is to fund Tory tax cuts. Today's outstanding figures
make the idea of effectively abolishing Scottish Nuclear, in the name of
privatisation, all the more unacceptable.''
The rise in net profits from #72m to #150m was the result of record
output from the two AGR stations at Hunterston and Torness; further
improvements in productivity; and the first impact of the #4000m
reprocessing deal struck with British Nuclear Fuels in March, after the
Scottish company had threatened to build dry stores for spent fuel at
its power stations rather than pay BNF's old charges for reprocessing.
Output was up 19% to 16.9 Terawatt hours, way ahead of the top end of
the company's target range, 16.5 Twh. Output per employee rose 32%.
Controllable costs, at #115.4m, were below the bottom end of the target
range.
Scottish Nuclear executives had been planning to get unit generating
costs down from the 1993/94 figure of 2.9p to an ambitious 2.5p. The
outcome is a remarkable 2.2p. Mr Hann says they are now shooting for 2p.
Chief executive Robin Jeffrey said the results demonstrated Scottish
Nuclear's ''ability to reduce costs safely to the point where, if the
decision is taken to privatise the nuclear generators, Scottish Nuclear
will be ready to take on the challenges that this will bring.''
''This is a truly magnificent performance by all our staff,'' said Mr
Hann, who is still waiting for his first meeting with Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang on the proposal that Scottish Nuclear and Nuclear Electric
might merge prior to privatisation.

SCOTTISH Nuclear's East Kilbride headquarters would survive under a
merger with Nuclear Electric which is even suggesting that, when
privatised, the new combined corporate HQ should be in Edinburgh.
Far from seeing Scottish Nuclear jobs threatened, Nuclear Electric
maintains that such a link-up would safeguard jobs and job prospects by
creating a nuclear power generator large enough to compete with National
Power and PowerGen at home as well as for lucrative projects overseas.
Nuclear Electric's chief executive Dr Robert Hawley said yesterday
that his company was looking forward to possibly merging with colleagues
in Scottish Nuclear in a move which could only strengthen the
international prospects of the UK's nuclear industry.
He said his company was now marketing the Sizewell B design
internationally and as with Scottish Nuclear was a key player in
improving Eastern European stations, adding: ''Together, even more would
be possible.
''With a Scottish organisation still headquartered in East Kilbride
and a new parent company possibly in Edinburgh, the merged organisation
would be good for Scotland and Scottish jobs but also for taxpayers and
consumers throughout the UK.''
It would be large enough to offer serious commercial competition to
National Power and PowerGen and ensure prices were kept low and that the
taxpayer received the maximum benefit from privatisation.
Nuclear Electric, which would retain its headquarters at Barnwood,
Gloucestershire, believes that a stand-alone privatised Scottish Nuclear
would be too small to compete and would be vulnerable to a
straightforward trade sale.
The likes of Scottish Power, Hanson, or Electricite de France are seen
as potential bidders.
It is also argued that any hiving-off of Nuclear Electric units to
Scottish Nuclear would result in two companies, neither of which would
be big enough to compete effectively.
A combined nuclear operation, less the ageing Magnox stations which
are to be retained in public ownership, would represent about 22% of the
UK power generation market, roughly equivalent to the output of National
Power and larger than PowerGen's 16%.
Mr James Hann, Scottish Nuclear's chairman, declined to become
involved in a public debate with his English colleagues but commented:
''We stand by our performance as revealed in our figures today and await
proper detailed proposals from Government.''

A LABOUR MP last night criticised a Government review of nuclear
material shipments between Dounreay and Sellafield, claiming it failed
to address safety criteria.
Supported by the Shetland-based environmental body, Northern Europe
Nuclear Information Group, Mr Llew Smith (Blaenau Gwent) said ''an
accident is waiting to happen'' as freighters carrying toxic plutonium
nitrate ply the waters between Caithness and Cumbria.
A review by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority assessed safety
standards and the likely impact of a maritime accident. It concluded
that, despite a fear of contamination and a hazard to health from
sea-spray dispersal of radiation, such a release would be
''negligible''.
However, Mr Smith, who requested the release of the report, called for
an immediate ban on shipments of nuclear materials by air, sea or road.

NURSES will hand in a 33,000-signature petition to the Scottish Office
today amid fears that its tough line on the pay deal may lead the Royal
College of Nursing to drop its no-strike policy throughout the UK.
Ms June Andrews, Scottish Secretary of the RCN, said differing
approaches had been adopted north and south of the Border, since the Pay
Review Body's recommendation in February of a 1% rise with a further 2%
to be negotiated locally.
She said Ministers had taken a much harder public line in Scotland and
had failed to give a central lead to trusts on pay negotiations.
''The support from the public, MPs, and doctors in Scotland is quite
overwhelming, in stark contrast to the poor response from Scottish
trusts, so far,'' said Ms Andrews.
''English and Welsh trusts received guidance some weeks ago from the
NHS executive to give an early indication of their pay offers.''
She said the 46 trusts in Scotland had, in effect, been paralysed
because of the lack of central guidance, although there were indications
that this would be issued shortly.
In response to RCN demands for the full 3% increase, most trusts had
said they were waiting for a lead from their health boards or the
Scottish NHS management executive.
Only four had indicated likely offers: Inverclyde, Greenock (2.5%),
Grampian Healthcare (2.83%), Southern General, Glasgow (3%), and North
Ayrshire (3%).
Of the 500 trusts in the UK, 127 had made offers, of which 80% were
for 3% or more.
The RCN UK Council will meet tomorrow to consider changing its policy
on industrial action in the wake of rank and file anger at the pay
award.
''This is a critical meeting. The thing that worries me most is that
Scotland seems to be dragging its feet,'' said Ms Andrews.
''If the Government has not demonstrated to Scottish nurses that they
are making some kind of movement, as it has done in England and Wales,
that could tilt the balance and precipitate a UK-wide change of rules.''
She said trusts had been established later in Scotland and many simply
did not have the expertise to deal with local pay issues.

A NEW project to set up after-school clubs for latch-key children was
launched yesterday by the Woman's Guild of the Church of Scotland.
The initiative was announced on the first day of the guild's annual
business meeting in Edinburgh, which is expected to be attended by 7000
women over the next four days.
Child care is the latest issue to be tackled by the church group which
has sought to update its image in recent years. The guild has raised
more than #1m in the last 25 years for a diverse range of projects,
including a help group for prostitutes in Leith, funding equipment for
schools overseas and raising cash for the training of counsellors.
Members will now embark on a special programme to raise cash for the
''School's Out'' network -- and raise awareness of the issue within the
Church.
The project has been developed with the Kirk's Board of National
Mission.
Deaconess Kay MacIntosh, who runs a successful after-school club in
South Leith, Edinburgh, said she saw the need for a safe environment,
from 3pm to 6pm, five years ago.
The club has brought more youngsters into churches as a result, she
said. But she stressed the project also provided a practical service to
the community.
''With the number of single parents on the increase and financial
pressures on families for both partners to work, the project could
provide support for a whole range of people.''
The guild believes many church halls could be used to provide a base
for clubs.
It aims to raise enough cash to appoint one or two full-time workers
to raise funds and awareness and hold talks with local authorities over
setting up the clubs.
Earlier, the women heard they were to be consulted over possible
changes in the organisation.
Research and development officer Mrs Jane Gray said members would be
asked for their views over the proposals which include moving the annual
meeting to later in the year and introducing a more flexible structure
to allow more meetings to be held locally.

MOVES to involve young adults in the courts of the Church of Scotland
have been put forward in a report which highlights a decline in their
church attendance.
The report to next month's General Assembly from the board of parish
education shows the Sunday School movement is in a state of ''chronic
numerical decline''.
Moreover, a study of young people aged 16 and over indicates that for
the majority the Church is ''a distant, mysterious, and unwelcoming
place''.
The study also shows that the image of the Church and clergy as
portrayed in the media is influential, the Kirk is out of touch with the
younger generation's world, and it is seen as the institution that says
''No''.
The only Bible commandments many young people could quote related to
murder, theft, and adultery. God, Jesus, or anyone associated with the
Church did not feature as a role model.
The report urges the Kirk, as a matter of urgency, ''to contrive,
negotiate, and facilitate'' ways of allowing young people to be more
involved in the worship and life of congregations.
It says: ''In the case of young adults, they should be included in the
courts of the Church, including the General Assembly and presbyteries.
''Indeed, the general message to the Church may well be that not just
young people, but people of all ages, seek and would value a less
passive form of church life.''
The Assembly will be told that, although the situation is not all doom
and gloom, there is little comfort after an exhaustive examination on
the falling numbers of children and young people.
While maintaining that there are success stories, the report says the
Kirk is losing ground, particularly among the young.
Calling for action from the Assembly, the report accepts there can be
no ''quick fix'' solution.
Among the findings was a steady drop in baptisms. A major rethink was
needed to reverse ''this downward spiral of disengagement and
disinterest''.
The report continues: ''It is clear that, regardless of fluctuations
in the number of children in the population, the Church is facing an
enormous challenge if it is to recover ground in the 1990s and beyond.''
Bible Class, Youth Fellowship, and youth club attendances showed
considerable losses.
A ''disturbing'' decrease was recorded in numbers presenting
themselves for confirmation through public profession of faith.
The report warns that the ''absentee father'' syndrome arising from
fewer men in congregations had become a fact of modern church life and
was bound to send a signal to children about the nature of church and
religious life.

CONCERN was growing last night for the safety of two 14-year-old girls
missing from their homes for more than four days.
Sidena Hamilton and her friend Sandra Hay, pupils at Newbattle High
School in Midlothian, have been missing since Friday evening.
Police have appealed for information to help find the girls who were
last seen in the company of two young men at Edinburgh's Waverley
railway station.
Sidena's parents, Brian and Michelle Hamilton, yesterday made an
anguished plea for them to return home.
Mr Hamilton, 36, of The Square, Newtongrange said: ''We are all
worried sick. We just have no idea what happened to them.
''We gave Sidena #12 to go into Edinburgh after school on Friday to
buy a pair of shoes. That's the last we've seen or heard of her.
''Every day since she went missing I've been in Edinburgh going round
the cafes and amusement arcades to try and find her.
His wife Michelle, 32, a mother of five said: ''It's my birthday today
and the perfect birthday present would be for Sidena to walk through the
door.''
Sidena is described as being 5ft 4in tall, of slim build, with
straight brown hair. She was wearing blue jeans, a dark green shell suit
top with black lettering on the back and purple stripes on both arms.
Sandra, of Pentland Avenue, Gorebridge is described as 5ft 6in, of
medium build, with brown hair and was wearing a dark blue jacket and
long black skirt buttoned at the front.
One of the youths seen with the girls is described as being 19 years
old, of slim build with short dark hair, wearing jeans, a red top and a
black baseball cap.
The other was in his early 20s, around 5ft 5in, of stocky build and
with a small, dark moustache. He was wearing a black ''Eclipse'' jacket
with a black top and blue jeans.

Ginger Rogers, queen of the light fantastic, joins partner Fred
Astaire in screen history
GINGER Rogers, who died yesterday aged 83, made dance floor magic with
Fred Astaire in a string of classic Hollywood musicals.
Her career spanned 65 years in every field of show business from
vaudeville to television.
During the 1940s she was one of the highest paid and most sought-after
Hollywood stars. She went on to win an Oscar, for best actress in the
drama Kitty Foyle.
However she is most remembered for the blissful partnership with
Astaire in sparkling musicals that broke the gloom of 1930s America.
With Astaire in top hat and tails, and Rogers in flowing ballgown, they
glided over polished floors in a perfect display of grace and romance.
Astaire died in 1978.
She once said their teaming up was ''just a wonderful happening. It
wasn't planned. I thought it turned out to be magic.''
In most of their 10 films together, Astaire played smitten pursuer and
Rogers the petulant beauty. Despite the air of romance there were no
love scenes. In her 1991 autobiography Rogers claimed that Astaire's
wife Phyllis ''didn't want him kissing other women''.
She continued performing her musical show into her late 70s until ill
health confined her to a wheelchair.
Even then she toured extensively to promote her autobiography, Ginger:
My Story.
She married and divorced five times and had no children.
Born Virginia Katherine McMath on July 16, 1911, in Independence,
Missouri, she acquired the name Ginger because a cousin could not
pronounce Virginia. The name came out ''Ginja''. Her natural father
abandoned her pregnant mother, so she later took her stepfather's name,
Rogers.
She first achieved notice as Charleston Champion of Texas and went on
to tour in a vaudeville act called Ginger Rogers and Her Redheads.
She began appearing in musical short films and at Christmas 1929
opened in a Broadway musical, Top Speed.
She began her film career a year later in Young Man of Manhattan, as a
society flapper.
Girl Crazy, a Gershwin musical of 1930 in which Ethel Merman sang I
Got Rhythm -- established her stardom.
During rehearsals the producers were unhappy with the Embraceable You
number and called in the expert help of Fred Astaire, then starring on
Broadway with his sister Adele. Astaire watched the routine said:
''Here, Ginger, try it with me.''
It was the first Astaire-Rogers dance.
In her biography, Rogers stressed that she had made 20 films before
working with Astaire on Flying Down to Rio, in 1933. He had appeared in
one. And she insisted they did not hate each other, ''despite occasional
snits''.
''We had fun, and it shows,'' she wrote. ''True, we were never bosom
buddies off the screen; we were different people with different
interests. We were a couple only on film.''
However, by 1939 the Astaire-Rogers vogue had run its course, and
their careers separated.
They had one reunion in 1949 when Gene Kelly broke a leg and Astaire
came out of retirement to replace him in The Barkleys of Broadway at
MGM.
After the first break-up of the team, some observers believed Ginger's
career would languish without Astaire. She defied them by playing a
dramatic role in Kitty Foyle that won her the Oscar.
Her film career thrived for 25 years because of her adaptability to
the times. In early films like 42nd Street, she was often a streetwise
modern woman.
Her last film was in 1965 as Jean Harlow's mother in one of two
quickly made versions of Harlow's life. In interviews, she made clear
her distaste for the new frankness of Hollywood films.
''We made happy pictures that people enjoyed seeing, not the kind that
audiences have to go through a trauma to see nowadays,'' she said. ''The
films were humorous, light, and beautiful. Women were not obsolete then.
We were not ashamed of women. In fact, women were as important as men in
films.''

EXCLUSIVE
A PRINTING firm set up 144 years ago in Paisley is to close at the end
of next month with the loss of 69 jobs.
T &amp; R Graham, part of the Belgium-based UCB Transpac group, will cease
trading on May 31 after losing money for a number of years in
''extremely difficult market conditions''.
Last night, the plight of the workforce was taken up in Brussels by Mr
Hugh McMahon, Labour Euro MP for Strathclyde West, whose constituency
includes Paisley. He said: ''This is another piece of bad news for
Paisley and Renfrew district, where the levels of unemployment are
already unacceptably high.''
The Paisley company's managing director, Mr Eric Sowerby, said
yesterday that the parent company had decided to concentrate its efforts
in Europe.
Mr Sowerby said the workforce, which prints packaging for the food
industry, had been stunned when told the news. However, he added: ''The
company's terms have been good and we will have an orderly closure. We
are running the plant down and are taking no more orders.''
Mr Sowerby said the company, which is the only UCB offshoot in
Scotland, had experienced trading conditions which had not been
favourable to small units such as itself.
UCB is divided into different sectors, including chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, film, and packaging.
Mr Sowerby said workers who were being made redundant would have the
opportunity of transferring into the film group which is based in
Cumbria.
He said: ''We have asked for the names of people who want to move
elsewhere in the group and a few have put their names forward.''
However, quite a few of the workforce were approaching retirement and
did not want to leave the area, he said.
The company was established in 1851 as a small family business. Mr
Sowerby said: ''It has done all kinds of things, including printing bus
tickets.
Mr Sowerby declined to reveal the extent of the losses the company had
suffered.
Speaking from Brussels, Mr McMahon said he had written to Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish Secretary, and Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, Commissioner for
regional policy, to ask for their support.
He said he had impressed on Mr Lang and the Commissioner that people
in the area needed an early decision in favour of a submission from the
district council for new Euro-funding. The submission involves the
so-called Urban Initiative which envisages the spending of #4.7m on
projects aimed at reducing unemployment.
Officials of the Graphical, Paper, and Media union were not available
for comment.

THE National Lottery organiser, Camelot, said yesterday it was
confident that an alleged cheating controversy would not do long-lasting
damage to the reputation of its scratch-card games.
The group promised that any ticket sellers attempting to cheat would
be found out.
The warning came after it was revealed that a shopkeeper in Salisbury,
Wiltshire, had been stopped from selling tickets and had his equipment
confiscated after complaints from punters.
Police said they were not looking into the allegations against the
newsagent.
Camelot is also looking into an incident in Scotland where an agent
was accused of tampering with game cards.
The company said it was also investigating three other retailers in
other parts of the country accused of tampering with Instants cards.
Officials said instances of alleged wrongdoing were ''isolated'' and
tickets that had been tampered with could easily be spotted by players.
''I don't think people need have any great fears,'' said Camelot
communications officer, Mr David Rigg.
''I would warn any retailers thinking of cheating that we will catch
them and fall on them like a ton of bricks and they will be in big
trouble when we have caught them.''
The company advised punters to examine Instants cards carefully to
ensure they were not defaced.

THE countdown to an all-out, indefinite strike at Rolls-Royce's East
Kilbride plant has begun.
However, unions last night claimed that management now recognised it
must do something to resolve the impasse and had conceded the company's
position ''was negotiable''.
The claim followed a meeting between management and unions after staff
voted unanimously to escalate a rolling programme of stoppages at the
plant which is threatened with closure.
They approved two-day strikes each week over the next three weeks but
an all-out strike is threatened from Tuesday if Rolls-Royce carries out
its threat of 25 compulsory redundancies from Sunday.
After the mass meeting, Derby-based engineering director Mr Eric
Betsworth -- charged with achieving a smooth transfer of work south --
insisted that the company's position was ''not negotiable''.
Both sides appeared more entrenched than ever since Rolls-Royce
announced work at the engineering and design centre would transfer to
Derby and Bristol later this year.
However, joint unions' committee chairman Mr Owen Thomas said last
night that management now realised the strength of feeling among the
East Kilbride workforce.
A formal response from the company to the notice of further industrial
action is now awaited. The stalemate is clear cut: the company wants
unions to produce proposals that will achieve the transfer of work to
England but unions insist East Kilbride must remain intact and they have
no intention of doing management's ''dirty work''.
That impasse must be broken soon, not only to prevent an all-out
strike but the rancour spreading to other Rolls-Royce plants as fears
grow that worldwide business has already been damaged.
Ironically, the company may have to impose compulsory redundancies if
its aims are to be achieved -- in turn leading to further fury among the
workforce. Rolls-Royce union delegates from other UK plants will visit
East Kilbride at the weekend to discuss how to support colleagues.
Derby and Bristol have already pledged they will not handle any work
transferred south because of the ongoing overtime ban and rolling
programme of strikes.
The sheer scale of votes for further industrial action caught
management by surprise. The unanimous support is likely to dilute
speculation that staff are interested only in enhancing redundancy
terms. The issue has been further complicated by the company withdrawing
enhanced offers, worth up to #10,000, while industrial action takes
place.
At press briefings in the run-up to the mass meeting, the company
seemed haunted by previous declarations that East Kilbride performs more
efficiently and cheaply than English counterparts.
It said it was wrong to call it a profit centre because ''individual
sites are not measured in profit and loss terms''.
The company claimed it would find ways of satisfying customers needs
during the dispute but did not spell these out. Observers suspect
Rolls-Royce's worldwide aero-engine operations could be crippled because
of the troubles.
Mr Thomas said staff were prepared to listen to any proposal to end
the dispute. He ridiculed company claims that it has helped 100 people
to find jobs elsewhere.
However, he welcomed the plant's warehouse switch into the adjacent
aero- engine services' division, with about 100 jobs safeguarded.

A DOCTOR who accepted an out-of-court settlement of #5600 from his
former health authority employer, yesterday claimed that patients had
died because of mistakes made by exhausted doctors.
Dr Chris Johnstone, who claimed he had worked an 112-hour week at
University College Hospital as a junior doctor in obstetrics and
gynaecology, accused Camden and Islington Health Authority of acting
unlawfully in forcing him to work such long hours.
He said: ''There have been cases where it is believed people died as a
result of doctors making mistakes through overwork.
''A confidential inquiry into these deaths implicated exhaustion as a
factor which contributed to their deaths.''
Dr Johnstone's legal action began in March 1989, helped by a Court of
Appeal landmark ruling in December 1990, stating that he was required to
work so much overtime that it would damage his health.
Last night, the health authority agreed to the settlement, as well as
paying the court costs estimated at more than #150,000.
The doctor, who worked an average 79-hour week, said: ''In paying me
damages, the health authority has publicly acknowledged that my working
conditions were not only unsafe, but unlawful.
''I worked such long hours and with so little sleep that I became
dangerously sleep deprived.
''I became depressed and reached such extremes of exhaustion that I
had to stop working. Looking back I find my working conditions inhuman.
''I felt pushed beyond what could reasonably be expected of any human
being. I felt tortured by lack of sleep, I felt desperate, and at times
even suicidal.
''I was a victim of a system that abuses and damages young doctors,
and what concerns me is that some juniors are still working like this.
''This is a dangerous system of work, both for doctors and patients.
''After 10 court hearings over six years, I feel such a relief.
''This is a tremendous victory not just for junior doctors, but for
all who are pushed beyond their limits in unsafe working conditions.''
Dr Johnstone now works part-time as a doctor and group therapist in a
specialist treatment unit for alcoholics in Bristol.
He said he had now recovered from his traumatic ordeal, and added: ''I
have left money, but now have a lot more joy in my life.
''There have been times when I regretted being a doctor, but now I
feel very happy with my work.''
In a statement, the Camden and Islington Health Authority said that it
had made no admission of liability by agreeing to the settlement.
It said that the doctor originally asked for #75,000 damages but -- by
accepting just #5600 -- his action speaks for itself.
The statement said: ''It was open to Dr Johnstone to ignore this
payment and continue with his action if he felt that he had a strong
enough case against the authority.
''However, he chose instead to accept the money and abandon his claim.
His action speaks for itself, and is inconsistent with any confidence in
the case.''
The statement went on: ''In the light of the substantial irrecoverable
costs that would be incurred by a two-week trial, the health authority
took a financial view and paid into court a nominal sum of #5600, making
no admission of liability.
''From the outset, the health authority has denied Dr Johnstone's
allegations, and has vigorously defended the action.
''In particular, it relied on the fact that the hours which he worked
were those he had expressly agreed to work.
''In March 1989, Dr Johnstone began proceedings against the then
Bloomsbury Health Authority, (now Camden and Islington Health
Authority). He claimed an injunction and declaration arising from
working hours which he claimed were excessive, and asked for damages in
the region of #75,000, including interest.''

A LETTER bomb campaign, thought to be the work of animal rights
activists, appeared to be under way yesterday on both sides of the
Border.
In Scotland, the headquarters in Edinburgh of one of the world's
leading health-care companies and shop premises in Glasgow run by the
Alaska Fur Company were targets for packages later dealt with by Army
bomb squad teams.
In the south, an envelope containing an explosive device and addressed
to Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave's country home was
intercepted by Post Office sorting staff near Bath.
A fourth device, again made safe, was reported to have been sent to
former Defence Secretary Tom King.
A Royal Mail spokesman said: ''We can confirm there have been four
incendiary devices that have been deposited. They were all posted in the
London area yesterday.''
Last night, no-one had claimed responsibility for any of the packages.
Detectives from several forces -- Strathclyde, Lothian and Borders,
and Somerset and Avon -- are liaising with Scotland Yard, whose
anti-terrorist branch is believed to be co-ordinating the investigation.
A Lothian and Borders police spokesman said they could not rule out
the possibility of a connection between the incident in their area and
at least one other.
Yesterday's device sent to Edinburgh-based Ethicon Ltd, part of the
Johnson and Johnson group, was discovered during routine screening of
mail at their main factory at Sighthill.
The firm has research laboratories where rats are involved in certain
testing of products under Government regulations.
A package delivered to the Alaska Fur Company in Glasgow's Miller
Street was reported to the police. A bomb squad team later carried out a
controlled explosion.

HIGHLAND Regional Council yesterday launched its legal challenge
against British Rail's decision to close the West Highland sleeper
service.
In its action at the Court of Session the region alleges that the
closure decision is illegal, irrational and unreasonable and it accuses
BR of perpetrating a ''sham'' by planning to run ''ghost trains'' on
short stretches of line near Glasgow.
It is alleged that by introducing these late-night, one-way services
British Rail can claim the lines are still operational and avoid a
public inquiry.
The region also argues that the withdrawal of the sleeper service
between Fort William and London, which has operated since 1901, will
have a big impact on the area's economy.
BR announced its intention to discontinue the sleeper service from May
28 this year.
In its petition for judicial review of the closure decision, Highland
region accuses BR of trying to circumvent statutory closure procedures
required by the 1993 Railways Act.
It says BR is attempting to achieve this by providing late-night
one-way services on three stretches of track in the Glasgow area. For
example, one train will run between Maryhill (departing two minutes
before midnight) and Bishopbriggs.
Highland region argues that there has never been any passenger service
between Maryhill and Bishopbriggs and that the running of a service at
23.58 is ''of no conceivable use or benefit to the travelling public''.
The region alleges: ''The proposed new services between Maryhill and
and Bishopbriggs, Greenhill Lower Junction and Cumbernauld and
Cumbernauld and Glasgow are all shams designed to circumvent statutory
safeguards.
''The decision to withdraw the West Highland sleeper services and
replace them with sham services is irrational and unreasonable.''
The region will ask a Court of Session judge to set aside the decision
to end the sleeper service and for an interdict banning its
discontinuation in the absence of statutory consultation over the three
stretches of Glasgow line.
It is also asking the court to declare that the proposed withdrawal of
the sleeper services amounts to the withdrawal of rail passenger
services over the sections of line in the Glasgow area under the 1993
Act.
No date has yet been set for a full hearing.
Meanwhile, Railtrack has raised hopes of improvements to the line
north of Inverness, which could trim 20 minutes off the journey to
Caithness.
Its Scottish director, Mr Paul Prescott, is travelling north next
month to inspect two proposed new projects for which Railtrack could
potentially apply for European Objective One funding.
A Railtrack spokesman yesterday said a scheme to realign the track
approaching Georgemas -- to allow through trains from Thurso -- and
another to improve level crossings (at Marel, near Helmsdale, and
Bilbster, near Watten) will be looked at by Mr Prescott during his
visit.

EXCLUSIVE
POLITICAL reverberations from the battle for control of Scottish
Nuclear continued to spread yesterday as a prominent Tory candidate
accused his own party's headquarters of being ''highly insensitive'' on
the issue.
Mr Struan Stevenson, the Conservatives' prospective parliamentary
candidate for Dumfries, criticised party managers for including a
Nuclear Electric newsletter among briefing papers circulated to MPs,
candidates, and other influential party figures.
Scottish industry too is lining up firmly on the side of retaining an
independent Scottish nuclear company. Only the day after former
ScottishPower chairman Sir Donald Miller accused the Government of ''a
breach of faith'' if they confirm plans to allow Nuclear Electric to
absorb the Scottish operation, two more leading business figures joined
the growing body of opponents.
Mr Hamish Morrison, chief executive of Scottish Council Development
and Industry, has written to the Secretary of State describing the
planned merger as ''immensely damaging'' while his counterpart at
Scottish Engineering, Mr Howard Jordan, in a letter to The Herald,
compared the plan to a ''hijack of one of our major high-technology
engineering institutions''.
The publication which so angered Mr Stevenson is the latest edition of
Nuclear Electric's company newsletter, Update, which carries a
front-page opinion piece which he says is a clear call for a merger with
Scottish Nuclear.
Mr Stevenson, a former Conservative councillor, said yesterday: ''This
newsletter was sent out by Conservative Central Office with routine
briefings to subscribers on the mailing list, which would include
elected representatives and party activists in Scotland.
''There was a slip of paper, basically a disclaimer, saying that this
document was being sent out at no cost to the party and that the views
it contained were not necessarily those of the party.
''But it is highly insensitive to allow this particular document to be
included in their pack of literature at a time when this highly
sensitive debate is taking place.
''It is clearly a cry from Nuclear Electric for not only privatisation
but an expanded asset base. The implications of that are 'let's grasp
the whole of the nuclear industry in Britain and thereby swallow up
Scottish Nuclear'.''
Mr Stevenson said the Government's energy policy was supposed to be
directed towards three goals: security of supply; diversity of supply;
and efficiency. He added: ''I do not believe that allowing Nuclear
Electric to swallow up the Scottish nuclear industry would achieve all
those objectives. Diversity of supply would be destroyed if a monopoly
operator were allowed to emerge.''
A spokeswoman at Conservative Central Office in London yesterday said
of the Nuclear Electric newsletter: ''This is their material, it has
nothing to do with the party. It is a commercial arrangement and we put
a disclaimer in there.
''We put material like this in our mailings from time to time. People
can pay to have their material distributed in that way. If people do not
want to read the newsletter, they can put it in the bin.''
She could not say how much Nuclear Electric had paid for the inclusion
of the newsletter.
The front-page opinion piece appears to be attributed to Nuclear
Electric chairman John Collier, as it is contained within inverted
commas and is placed beside a picture of him.
The article states: ''Nuclear Electric needs greater commercial
freedom if it is to realise its full potential at home and abroad . . .
We believe privatisation to be the best option.
''But we need also to ensure that if the company does move into the
private sector, it does so with a big enough asset base from which to
invest for the future and from which to compete in export markets.
''We must certainly keep our six modern reactors together and not
break them up as some have suggested. If you have a winner, you trust it
with freedom -- you don't hive off its plant to other generators.''
This would appear to be a reference to suggestions which have arisen
during the current debate on the future of the nuclear power industry,
that two of Nuclear Electric's stations should be transferred to
Scottish Nuclear which currently has only two, the so-called
''four-four'' option.

IN angry Commons exchanges yesterday, Labour leader Tony Blair accused
Mr John Major of caving in to his Euro rebels as seven of the nine
excluded Tory MPs accepted the Government's offer of the party whip --
but remained resolutely defiant over Europe.
With the rebels promising instead to keep up their fight against the
''European super-state'', Mr Major's day-old attempt to mend the rift
which has left the Government without a Commons majority for five months
appeared to falter.
Mr Blair said the white flag of surrender now flew over Downing
Street, after it emerged that no promise of future loyalty had been
extracted from the rebels in exchange for their return to the whip.
The Prime Minister said Labour was just as divided over Europe and
reminded Mr Blair that dozens of Labour MPs had voted with the rebels
against the Maastricht Treaty and other European legislation.
However, the most telling blow during a dramatic Prime Minister's
Questions came from Mr Blair, who produced an uproar of Labour MP cheers
with a single unscripted reply.
Mr Blair had opened by taunting Mr Major for failing to have secured
''even a minimal guarantee'' of loyalty from the rebels. Mr Major,
citing Labour's own dissension over Europe, retorted: ''These are party
matters. Will you tell us what your position is?''
In an unscripted reply, Mr Blair shot back: ''There is one big
difference -- I lead my party, you follow yours.'' Delighted Labour MPs
cheered and waved their order papers.
Mr Blair went on: ''After all your tough talk in the beginning about
no unity through appeasement, you have caved in, your party is still
divided, and the white flag flies over Downing Street.''
A rattled Mr Major replied: ''I will give you a real difference. We
have been leading in Europe. You will follow in Europe on every issue.
You will follow Europe in undermining our veto, in renegotiating our
rebate, in surrendering our opt out, in signing up to the Social
Chapter, in higher taxes, more spending, and more red tape.''
The return of the seven MPs was marked by a succession of media
appearances during which they made it clear it was the Government that
had altered its views on Europe to suit them, not the other way around.
Eight had the whip withdrawn. The ninth, Sir Richard Body (Holland
with Boston), resigned in sympathy. Yesterday, he and Mr Michael
Carttiss (Great Yarmouth) had not yet decided whether to accept the whip
but were expected to follow their colleagues' lead shortly.
At the outset, Downing Street had insisted their return would be
conditional on their voting record. Yesterday, however, Labour produced
a breakdown of the rebels' voting records in the five months they have
been excluded from the whip, which showed that each of the rebels missed
at least 30 important votes.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, party chairman, conceded that no conditions had been
set or pledges of loyalty demanded. Instead, he urged them to work for
party unity: ''These are individual MPs. They can say what they like
when they like. What I would ask them to do is to consider that we are
within two years of a General Election.''
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East and unofficial rebel spokesman,
said: ''We are now going to devote ourselves to doing everything we can
within the parliamentary party's institutions to strengthen policy in
Europe. It has become abundantly clear over the past few months that the
general public are fed up to the back teeth with the European Union.''

A MOTHER bravely fought off a bogus health worker who tried to snatch
her baby girl yesterday. The 35-year-old mother punched the woman in the
face in the street outside her home as the imposter tried to make off
with the baby in her arms.
It is the latest in a string of attempts by people trying to snatch
babies. Earlier this month, police in Glasgow and Edinburgh investigated
failed attempts by baby snatchers who claimed to be social workers.
Other incidents have been reported in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire.
Yesterday's incident happened around 2pm at the home of Mrs Lynn
Stewart in South Gyle Wynd, a new housing estate on the west side of
Edinburgh. The bogus health worker showed the mother an identification
card with the words Lothian Health Board and an ID picture on it.
She asked to see four-month-old Erin and was allowed into the living
room. The woman then asked to see the child's birth certificate and Mrs
Stewart left the woman with the child and went upstairs for the
certificate.
While upstairs, she heard a noise which made her suspicious and on
returning downstairs saw the woman leaving the house by the front door
with Erin in her arms.
Mrs Stewart, who has another child, Darren, three, confronted the
woman and in the struggle punched her, possibly on the left side of the
face, and snatched back her baby.
Last night, Erin's distraught parents didn't want to talk about their
ordeal but close friend Allison McKenzie, 32, who lives nearby, said the
woman had held Erin for 10 minutes in the house before asking to see the
birth certificate.
Mrs McKenzie added: ''Lynn heard the woman open the front door and saw
her go up the path. She followed her outside and punched and grappled
with her, before the woman ran off.''
Mr McKenzie, a shop worker who has two young children, said: ''The
woman must have inside knowledge to have known so much about Erin. It's
terrifying to think how somebody can get access to this sort of
information.''
The woman was last seen making her way along South Gyle Wynd. She is
described as aged about 38, around 5ft 8ins tall, of medium build and
with collar-length dark hair. She was smartly dressed in a navy blue
jacket and skirt, navy blue tights and shoes. She spoke with a local
accent.
A police spokesman said: ''This is a very serious incident where this
woman nearly succeeded in abducting this young baby. Fortunately, the
baby is unharmed but the mother is understandably badly shaken.
''The woman had obviously gone to some lengths to appear authentic.
She appears to have gained intimate knowledge of the child. We do not
want this to happen again and we would reinforce the advice to all
parents that they should not accept anyone as genuine until they can
prove who they are.
''Always ask for some form of identification and if still not
satisfied telephone the police immediately.''

PEACE of mind. That's what people increasingly look for, says Andy
McWhirter, GA's branch manager in Glasgow looking after residential
lettings.
From an office in Kilmarnock Road, he deals with a portfolio of
properties covering north of the city, south, the suburbs and
Lanarkshire.
''Letting has built up over the last eight years,'' he points out,
''and it is clear that the tenant and the landlord both want peace of
mind.
''There seems to be no guarantee of a job for life nowadays, and
making a total commitment to buy a property is an expensive move.
''People want to take on a property, or have it rented on their
behalf, but they don't want the hassle that can occur. GA is a pretty
big operator nationally. We're not going to disappear overnight.
Matching up quality accommodation and quality tenants gets the best of
both worlds, for both parties.''
What he feels is a unique service from GA is the offer of Rent
Indemnity and Legal Cost Insurance, plus a Property Protection Plan. The
indemnity scheme covers non-payment of rental - say, if a tenant becomes
unemployed - and the protection plan gives a level of cover not usually
available to landlords.
''Add in membership of the Association of Residential Letting Agents,
and we feel we can offer both parties the best service available,'' says
Andy McWhirter.
So what kinds of properties are there on the books, then?
There's a pleasant detached villa in East Kilbride, for a start. Three
bedrooms, master en suite with corner bath and electric shower. Lounge
with solid fuel fire, plus a balcony. Kitchen leading to the dining
area. Utility room, downstairs toilet. Additional shower room. Gas
central heating. Gardens to front and rear. Garage. All for #800 a
month.
A two-bedroom upper conversion in Shawlands. Lounge with bay windows.
Fully fitted kitchen with dining area. Floored loft. Bathroom with
shower. Gas central heating. Gardens all round. Yours for #550 a month.
Perhaps Ralston is more your scene. A convenient area, with a modern
flat of two bedrooms, lounge with TV. Dining kitchen. Bathroom with
shower. Gas central heating. Communal gardens and available parking
space. Just a tad more, at #600 a month.
Should you opt for Uplawmoor, there is a detached property, with three
bedrooms. One has dressing room and en suite facilities. There is a
lounge, dining room, fitted kitchen, bathroom. Toilet downstairs as
well. Oil-fired central heating this time. A car-port, and gardens to
the front. Ready, for #500 a month.
Down to Ayrshire? There's a modern detached villa with four bedrooms.
The master has usual en suite and shower. Lounge, dining room with patio
windows. Study, fitted kitchen, bathroom. Gas central heating. Front and
back gardens with patio to rear, and a double garage and garden shed.
The price is #550 a month.
Back to town, then, and move to Cathcart? A modern flat here gives two
bedrooms, master bedroom en suite with electric shower. Lounge with
balcony, fully fitted kitchen with dining area, bathroom, gas central
heating. Private parking. Available for #500 a month.
Not everyone wants everything laid on, of course. Anyone going for an
unfurnished property might well prefer a traditional flat, in Hillhead
for example. This one has two bedrooms, lounge with gas fire, fitted
kitchen, bathroom with shower, gas central heating, and a security
entrance. Going for #475 a month.

KDL Homes is an expanding company which specialises in building
quality homes in the Scottish Central Belt. It started business in March
1987 with a successful development of two-bedroom flats in Kilmacolm
which sold for #43,000. They have proved to be a sound investment as
they change hands for around #58,000 today.
The Dumbarton-based firm has a growing portfolio of successful
developments in some of the most desirable locations in central
Scotland. In a relatively short space of time KDL Homes has made a name
for itself by creating comfortable environments for quality living.
As managing director Tom Paice put it: ''We have always believed that
the care and quality we build into every one of our new homes deserves a
location and a setting to complement and enhance them. We put a lot of
time and effort into site selection and planning and we are certain that
this is reflected in the quality of the total environment which we
create for homeowners.''
Drive and enthusiasm are just two of the factors which led to KDL
enjoying an enviable reputation in the trade with well-established sites
in Busby, Paisley, Strathaven, Skelmorlie, Helensburgh, and the latest
developments at Lenzie and Gourock.
KDL Homes is happy to customise their homes to individual requirements
as long as this is indicated in advance. Colour schemes can be
co-ordinated, archways can be constructed, extra power points can be
incorporated and all reasonable requests can be complied with. Top of
the range double glazing, central heating and kitchens and bathrooms are
standard features.
At the Burnfoot site in Lenzie, the development of luxury two-bedroom
flats by KDL and Northern Rock Homes skillfully uses its attractive
location to best advantage.
Each flat comes complete with its own garage or secured parking.
Internally they are finished to a high specification. This includes gas
central heating and high performance double glazing. The light and airy
atmosphere is enhanced by careful design of the windows, coved ceilings
and an overall feeling of spaciousness.
The fitted kitchens are provided with oven/microwave, hob and cooker
hood, washer/dryer, fridge freezer, and dishwasher and can be finished
in a choice of co-ordinated styles and tile colours. En suite facilities
are standard in all homes at Burnfoot with co-ordinated tiling and

The Moorings at Gourock, with superb views over Cardwell Bay is a new
development of 20 two-bedroom luxury flats with either balconies or
garden patios. There is a choice of three different styles and each
apartment comes complete with gas central heating and high-performance
double glazed windows finished in Scandinavian timber. Throughout there
is a feeling of spaciousness with enhanced ceiling heights in the
lounges and hallways.
The kitchens are fitted in a choice of five styles and the units are
fully co-ordinated with a range of tiling. Fitted appliances include
built-in oven/microwave, hob and cooker unit, washer/dryer, fridge
freezer and dishwasher.
Each home has an en suite bathroom and shower room in the main bedroom
and the fully-fitted bathrooms come in a choice of colour co-ordinated
tiling. Standard fittings include alarm and door entry security systems,
electric circuit breakers, smoke detectors, TV aerial sockets and double
