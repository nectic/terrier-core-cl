FRIENDS in Scotland have just sent me cuttings of the articles written
by Jill Crawshaw. They knew I would react strongly to this totally
unfair and unbalanced attack on my beloved Scotland (I write as a
devoted Sassenach without even one Caledonian corpuscle). Has she never
heard that the right to criticise carries with it the responsibility to
be constructive?
The Scottish Tourist Board is not a travel agency. It is geared to
provide information and in my long experience it does this very well. It
is simply not true that the staff are unhelpful. I have had occasion to
be extremely grateful to and delighted with many of them -- from
Kirkwall to Stromness, Fort William to Mallaig, Pitlochry to Trafalgar
Square via Oban . . . they have gold-mines of splendid documentation.
One of Scotland's great assets is the vast variety of its countryside
and all it has to offer in almost every sphere except, perhaps, bright
lights in the remotest parts. This makes it extremely difficult for one
person to know it all in detail.
Miss Crawshaw seems to base her hit campaign on bad impressions she
has received in middle-range hotels. By far and away the larger
proportion of Scotland's visitors rely on the excellent B&amp;Bs, which she
had had the grace to acknowledge. One gets to know the real Scotland in
the well appointed houses, farms, and tiny crofts with their friendly,
helpful, and hospitable owners. In over 40 years I have never
encountered a hotel which is ''cold, dark, and dank with few
amenities''.
Scotland is not the place for individuals who would be interested in
''winter cheapies to Tunisia'' or ''last-minute bargains in Florida''.
It is the country for individuals, who normally like to make their own
plans. For those who do indeed like a package with everything laid on,
there are excellent coach and coach/rail holidays and I have heard
nothing but praise for these.
As for grumpy staff and discourteous receptions -- well, it has never
happened to me, ever, in spite of my southern accent.

THE Israeli Foreign Minister who becomes acting Prime Minister, Shimon
Peres, will almost certainly continue and intensify the growing goodwill
between Britain and Israel over recent years.
But, as a politician and an individual, Mr Peres, who was Prime
Minister in 1984, is about as different a character from Mr Rabin as it
is possible to be.
Mr Peres has been praised by Francois Mitterrand, the former French
President, as a man of ''intellectual depth''. Mr Peres described
himself, once, as a ''frustrated poet''.
''I was more of a dreamer, always drawn to the world of words --
poetry, prose, and Dostoevsky'', was how Mr Peres once described his
childhood.
He was born in Poland but lived in an environment that was emotionally
and mentally Israeli. Those of his relatives who stayed behind in Poland
perished in the Holocaust.
Even so, Mr Peres is a resilient politician and a man who has always
looked towards Europe, with its experience of building the European
Union, for help by giving advice on the development and financing of
institutions.
He always advocated a Benelux-like economic union between Israel,
Jordan, and the Palestinians and, beyond that, regional arrangements for
open trade.
But he remained doubtful about the self-government arrangements in the
West Bank and Gaza. ''They want a child without a pregnancy. That is a
little hard to achieve.''
He was born Shimon Persky in Vishneva, Poland, in 1923 and emigrated
to British Mandatory Palestine in 1934.
He was appointed Defence Minister in 1974 and was Labour Party leader
from 1977 to 1982. Two years later, he was Prime Minister. By 1986, he
was Foreign Minister and served as Finance Minister from 1988 to 1990.
He has been in his present post from 1992.
Earlier this year, in a welcome move, Mr Peres said that Israel was
ready to propose a Middle East free of non-conventional weapons and
missiles as soon as a regional peace was assured.
This was a considerable breakthrough in that Israeli arms had become a
stumbling block for Britain and America as they tried to cajole the
world's non-nuclear powers into supporting an indefinite extension of
the 25-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
But Mr Peres is hailed as a man of peace. He once said: ''I believe
the economic standard of living decides the political standard of
behaviour. When people are poor, they are hostile and desperate. There
is no answer to Islamic fundamentalism by writing a new Koran.
''You can do it by enabling people to read it differently.''

YITZHAK RABIN was a Jewish freedom fighter who became the unexpected
architect of the peace settlement between Israel and the Arab world. He
was a man of war who proved to be in the end a man of reconciliation, an
idealist who became a realist.
A dour chain smoker of few words and simple tastes he was soldier by
profession who came to politics relatively late in his career. Israel's
only 'sabra' or native born Prime Minister, Mr Rabin held office first
from 1974 until 1977 when his administration collapsed over a financial
scandal involving his wife, and then from 1992 until his assassination.
Charm was not among his attributes, but for all his hawk-like
demeanour he knew there had to be peace between Arab and Jew and he was
determined to achieve it, a determination which made him hated by both
Palestinians and Jewish extremists alike.
But his patriotic credentials as someone who helped found, maintain
and defend the Jewish state were impeccable. He joined the Jewish
Palmach, the underground army, at the age of 18, fought in the 1948 War
of Independence, and was Chief of Staff of Israel's armed forces in the
Six Day War of 1967. He was not a man to sell Israel out.
But they proved to no avail as far as Israel's Jewish extremists were
concerned. They hated him for the peace-making policies the world so
admired which led to his receiving the Nobel Peace prize with Yasser
Arafat two years ago.
As well as a soldier, Mr Rabin was also a diplomat, learning the
realities of international power broking during his time as ambassador
to Washington. Sent there in 1968, he came under the influence of Henry
Kissinger, realising something his political enemies in Likud, let alone
the religious extremists, never understood, just how essential for
Israel was the friendship of the United States.
It was a relationship he repaired and exploited to the full over the
last three years as he guided the peace process forward to what looked
likely to prove a successful outcome.
It was Britain's role, in the 1917 Balfour Declaration, enshrining the
United Kingdon's pledge to create a homeland for the Jews in Palestine
that Rabin regarded as the seminal act in the creation of Israel. It was
that declaration which warmed Rabin to Britain.
He said in an interview last March: ''As a result of the Balfour
Declaration, my father joined the British Army's Jewish legion with 1600
other Americans. My father came here as a British soldier in 1918, and
that is why I was born here.''
He was born in Jerusalem on March 1, 1922 in what was then British
ruled Palestine. His father had emigrated from the Ukraine, but he
appears a relatively shadowy figure. It was his mother, Rosa Cohen, a
socialist and Zionist from Odessa, who fought for independence, and was
one of the guiding forces in his life. Her Zionism, however, was not of
the ''blood and earth'' right-wing nationalism of Likud, which held out
the concept of ''Eretz Israel'' as an article of faith.
The early socialist leaders took a more pragmatic approach to the
establishment of a homeland and were not ideologically committed to
acquiring all the biblical lands. They were prepared to co-exist with
Arabs.
He became a student at the Kadoorie agricultural college and aged 18
was recruited by the Palmach, the underground army which played a major
role in the War of Indepencence. In 1948 he commanded the Jewish troops
in the crucial battle for Jerusalem. Only a year earlier, he had been
jailed for six months by the British for his activities in helping to
free illegal Jewish immigrants in Palestine.
Although he was a good agriculture student -- he won the British High
Commissioner's prize for excellence while at Kadoorie -- his experience
in the Palmach set him on a military career and by 1967 he had risen to
be Chief of Staff of Israel's defence forces during the Six Day War.
The following year he was appointed ambassador to Washington,
returning in 1973. He stood for the Knesset the following year and
defeated Shimon Peres in the election to succeed Golda Meir as Labour
party leader. He was Prime Minister from June 1974, following the
disastrous Yom Kippur War, to 1977 when he resigned both the party
leadership and the premiership after his wife, whom he married when they
were both in the Palmach, was involved in a scandal about currency
infringement involving an undeclared US bank account.
If it was not politically a successful time for him, he did receive
great acclaim for the way he ordered the daring Entebbe rescue mission
of airline passengers seized by Palestinian hijackers.
Both he and Labour went into the political wilderness for seven years
and Likud seized power under the charismatic Menachem Begin.
But in September 1984 he was back in a job, appointed Defence Minister
in the government of national unity formed between Labour and Likud with
Mr Peres as Prime Minister for the first two years, vice premier for the
remaining four.
He served as Defence Minister until 1990 when the coalition -- Yitzhak
Shamir, the Likud leader, was Prime Minister -- collapsed. He secured
the Labour leadership and won the 1992 General Election with a campaign
which portrayed Labour as the party of peace and security, appointing
his political rival, Mr Peres, Foreign Minister and deputy Prime
Minister.
They made an inspired coupling, Mr Rabin's unabashed toughess, at
first viewed with suspicion by the more progressive elements in his
party, countering the perception many Israelis had that the Foreign
Minister was a peacenik.
Last March, when Mr Rabin and the British Prime Minister John Major
met, the London-based Jewish Chronicle wrote that ''after more than 40
years of often lukewarm relations, Britain and Israel have now entered
on a period of unprecedented closeness''.
Anglo-Israeli ties reached a low point during the 1987-1993
Palestinian ''intifada'' in the Occupied Territories where British
officials criticised the Israeli army's use of force.
It was the Rabin-Arafat handshake which finally changed the British
Foreign Office's view. The object of John Major's visit last March was
to solidify the fragile peace negotiations and to act as a buttress to
Rabin, a situation which Rabin greatly appreciated. Major took with him
28 captains of industry. British trade with Israel jumped more than 30%
last year and Israel is now Britain's third biggest market in the
oil-rich Middle East.
Mr Rabin's assassination does not mean that everything he worked for
will fail, but it does put the whole process in jeopardy and could
fatally undermine the momentum for peace.
Eight years ago when Defence Minister he remarked in an interview that
no Arab leader who had tried to make peace, from King Abdullah of
Transjordan to the Lebanese president-elect, Nashit Gemayel, to
President Sadat of Egypt had ended his life in bed. Now an Israeli
leader too has fallen to an assassin.

FIFTY years ago, the Orcadian poet, Edwin Muir, set out in a battered
1921 Standard motor car to travel around Scotland. It was not a happy
journey. Muir was infinitely depressed by the grim conditions of the
1930s. He was in a black mood when he began his journey and a blacker
one when he had finished -- yet despite his stern intention to reach the
bleakest conclusions about Scotland, he kept on being side-tracked.
Scotland, in short, was refusing -- as always -- to conform to
stereotype.
All these years on, such a journey is a joyous escapade all too few of
us seem to have the opportunity to enjoy. Today it is possible to savour
a fleeting taste of every aspect of Scotland -- but the selection of a
comfortable and convenient base is paramount. Scotland's Heritage Hotels
certainly refuse to conform to any stereotype -- they are a collection
of idiosyncratic abodes situated in scenic and historic locations, ideal
for touring holiday.
The Ballathie House at Kinclaven, near Stanley is one such hotel and
it recently won the Country House Hotel of the Year in the Macallan
Taste of Scotland Awards.
Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed at Culloden Castle prior to his
disastrous battle, but today you can stay at the Palladian Mansion built
on the site of the castle in 1772. Chandeliers, marble fireplaces and
classical plasterwork relief's are features of Culloden House, set in 40
acres, just east of Inverness.
Deeside maybe the tourist Mecca, but Donside is every bit as dramatic.
An escape to tranquillity is on offer at Kildrummy Castle Hotel, close
by the ruins of the massive thirteenth-century castle. Here you can
experience the type of welcome almost forgetten in this hurry-up age.
With the recent Hollywood focus on William Wallace, there's no finer
retreat close to Stirling Castle than Cromlix House at Kinbuck, by
Dunblane. Built in 1874, this gracious hotel inspires escapism, right
down to its own chapel. But if touring is the order of the day, then the
scenic splendour of the wooded Trossachs and Loch Katrine are but a
short drive away.
The west coast too has strategically located hostelries in the
Heritage portfolio. Druimnacroish at Dervaig, on the Isle of Mull, is a
homely spot from which to explore this treasure island, with Invercreran
Country House Hotel set in the wild landscape of Glen Creran overlooking
Loch Linnhe handy for Fort William and Oban, while the Montgreenan
Mansion House Hotel in Kilwinning, built by Dr Robert Glasgow in 1817,
could not be a more palatial pied a terre from which to explore
Ayrshire.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie follows a deep and even path in Lappland where
Santa Claus is in residence all year
AROUND 1000 years have gone by since St Nicholas, Prince-Duke of
Bohemia, came across the poor man ''gathering winter fuuu-el'', of the
Christmas carol, and started off the whole legend of Santa Claus. Since
then, many lands have attempted to capture him, setting up special
''worlds'', where the cuddly red figure is in residence for most of the
year.
Though you find him in Sweden, Canada, Scotland, and many more
countries, just now Finland seems to be his favourite, with a Santa
Claus Christmas Village, right on the Arctic Circle. But what could be
more appropriate than Lappland? This far north, there is no need to
worry whether the snow will arrive on time. By October, it is already
whirling and by the end of that month, the snow is deep and crisp and
even for the next few months.
Even during the short Arctic summer, a visit to Santa Claus Village is
part of many tours north to Lappland. But Santa is always eager for
Christmas visitors, especially young ones, who fly in from
late-November, and he and his helpers have been busy for months in
Santa's workshop, making sure there are gifts and cards, ready for the
influx. Ten thousand from Britain alone came north to Rovaniemi before
and during last Christmas, sometimes on a one-day flight, many for a
longer break. The number increases steadily each year so that the Finns
are expecting even more for Christmas 1995.
In addition to the workshop, Santa Claus's village has first-class
gift shops, which indicate why Finland is known for the quality of its
design, restaurants and cafes, and Santa Claus's post office. This is no
toy but a working post office, which handles thousands of letters from
children all over the world. Finland is also known for its wonderful
glassware with many prominent names, such as Ittala, and the village has
the world's northern most glass factory, full of beautiful pieces. A
reindeer farm is not far away for a visit, and Santa himself is in the
village every day to meet children.
For the break over Christmas and New Year, Santa Claus and the
Rovaniemi hotels really pamper their guests. There are vodka tasting
parties, children can bake gingerbread, Santa's reindeers may come to
visit, there will be expeditions to collect Christmas trees, and
visiting musicians and perhaps an old-time shaman (magician) to
entertain, plus a great deal of good food. In Finland and other Nordic
countries, they celebrate Christmas with a great feast of hot and cold
dishes on Christmas Eve, after handing out presents. Christmas Day
itself tends to be kept for church and the inevitable outdoor world of
''the nature'' as they call it.
But important though Santa Claus and all that goes with him can be,
winter Finland has so much else. Rovaniemi itself is an interesting
town, enclosed by the junction of the Dunasjoki and Kemijoki (rivers),
with the hills of Ounasvaara, with great wooded slopes, a haunt of
reindeer and other animals. The skiing here is excellent in the Nordic
way, using long-skis and setting off into the forest and hills. It is
the best, often the only way to get around the forest on foot in winter.
Rovaniemi was totally destroyed during the Second World War, when
Finland found herself caught between the Soviet and German armies. But
Finland has long had many architects, and the plan for the new town was
by one of the most famous, Alvar Aalto. He also designed the Lappia
Hall, a marvellous centre with a concert hall, congress centre, one of
the world's most northerly theatres, a library, and the Lappland
Provincial Museum, which gives an excellent introduction to Lappland
life and the fauna and flora, much of it hiding from, or hidden by the
winter snow. There is also a magnificent modern altar frescoe in the
Lutheran Church.
But for most of us, the thrill is to get outside into the winter cold,
so dry that the temperatures seem degrees higher. For outdoor sports, it
is vital to wear good winter clothes. These usually consist of one-piece
Arctic suits over a middle layer of pile-cotton, with thermal underwear
below. Good, high boots, double socks and mitts are important, plus snow
goggles. Anything on the skin -- protective cream or make-up -- should
be oil, not water-based. Tour operators, hotels or log cabins (popular
and great fun) can usually provide outdoor outfits. Always ask in
advance.
Then, warmly clad, there are many things to try. Most trendies settle
first for a snowmobile, a bit like an open chunky racing car on skis.
The first surge of power is terrifying but then it is exhilarating. If
you can drive a car or motor bike, driving comes easily. In short a
snowmobile is noisy, smelly but exciting, and they do disturb the winter
peace.
Then there is the much more leisurely reindeer driving -- usually in
the care of the Sami people who move their great summer herds over the
north, not taking much notice of national boundaries. Reindeer
''safaris'' are fun, with a Sami driver to steer and guide, even more
wonderful at night when the silence is almost tangible and the lamps on
the sledges swing light over the snow.
With every outdoor watercourse frozen, fishing is an odd thought but
this is ice-fishing. You walk on to a frozen lake or river with a
curious instrument like a large screwdriver and bore a hole, making sure
that it is big enough for the biggest fish. Then, with a special line
and a small stool to sit on, you wait for the thrill of that first tug
on the line.
There is still more to do. Many places in Lappland organise occasional
snow-sculpture events, which produce such wonderful sculptures that I
always feel sad that they cannot last more than a month or two. Some 70
miles south-west of Rovaniemi at Kemi on the Baltic coast, there are
cruises on an ice-breaker through the alternating ridges and patterns of
the ice, even a chance of a dip in the sea -- not as cold as it sounds
in special survival suits! Then there is the sheer verve of watching
reindeer-racing, further north-east at Ivalo, not far from the Russian
border. It is all wild speed and a rush of hooves and skis.
But favourite of all for me is dog-sledging. The beautiful husky dogs,
already harnessed to the sledge and howling in their eagerness to get
going, are compelling. Once settled on board, the off comes fast. The
driver hauls up the metal anchor hook, and the yelping dogs run. The
sledge gives a gigantic jolt and then plunges after the team. If you are
not ready or sitting securely, you are sprawling in the snow, waving
goodbye to a team already a hundred yards away.
Even cuddled under reindeer skins, a sledge is not a naturally warm
place and the driver, standing at the back, is particularly glad of the
special clothing. Packed tight into the sledge, one behind the other,
there is hardly space to be cold, and daring one's hand at driving the
team, carefully supervised, is much more exciting than the snowmobile.
Inside again, winter Finland is almost sauna-warm, and then comes the
luxurious sauna itself. Once they have tried it, most people agree that
a day in the snow, and a lingering sauna followed by a good dinner are
the perfect ingredients for a glorious sense of physical well-being.

SCOTTISH Office Agriculture Minister, the Earl of Lindsay, has urged
growers to halt all imports of Dutch seed potatoes following an outbreak
of Potato Brown Rot in Holland.
Until tougher EC provisions were agreed he was introducing temporary
measures to require the Scottish Office agriculture department to be
notified of any Dutch consignments already brought in, said Lord
Lindsay. These stocks would be tested by the department, as would any
new arrivals.
Bob Reid, convener of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland potato
committee, said that the speed of action from the Scottish Office
indicated how serious a threat brown rot was to the Scottish industry.
''The whole industry must work together to protect the health status
of our seed,'' he said. ''None of us can afford to underestimate the
seriousness of this disease.''

<HEADLINE>End of an era for Broadmeadows Limousin herd</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

EAST Lothian farmer Douglas Crighton, who became one of the top
Limousin breeders in the country in the short space of 15 years, will
bow out of the competitive show circuit on Saturday.
His famous Broadmeadows herd, first established in Berwickshire and
then transferred to Chesters Farm near Garvald, will be sold off at the
Borderway Mart in Carlisle.
Even the Broadmeadows cattle float, in its smart blue and white
livery, is listed in the catalogue. There will be no turning back.
Limousins will not disappear entirely from the yard. Four young bulls
are being held back from the sale and will continue under the care of
stockman George Cormack who is setting up in business preparing cattle
for the showring.
The reason behind the dispersal is a familiar one. Nobody in the
family wishes to continue with the herd and, at 60 years of age, Douglas
Crighton feels it is time to wind down a little. His plan is to
concentrate on the arable side of the 200-acre farm.
The decision to pull out of pedigree cattle and sheep breeding was
taken fairly quickly. In August his son Russell, a chartered surveyor by
profession, confirmed that he was more interested in pursuing his career
than in taking on the herd. He is responsible for running the estate
attached to Crieff Hydro Hotel.
Mr Crighton has two married daughters but neither of them saw
themselves as a budding stockbreeder and so a dispersal sale seemed the
best move.
''I thought it was a good idea to go out when we were still on top,''
said Douglas.
Over the years Broadmeadows entries have rarely been far away from the
top at leading shows like the ''Highland'' and the ''Royal'' at
Stoneleigh. Between the two shows the herd can claim nine supreme
championships, three reserve supreme championships and two female
championships.
To that can be added the supreme award at the Limousin 2000 events at
Perth and Carlisle, confirming Broadmeadows as one of the most
formidable Limousin herds in the UK.
''One of my claims to fame is to have bred a mother, daughter and
grand-daughter who have all gone on to be declared supreme champions at
the Highland Show or the Royal,'' said Douglas.
He prides himself, too, on success in the sale ring. His subsidiary
cattle interest is in Belted Galloways and one of his top females made a
new record price of 4000 gns at Castle Douglas last week.
The week before that his Limousin bull Broadmeadows Jerico made the
top price for the breed at Perth bull sales -- 10,500gns. In all he sold
three bulls averaging #7250.
Stockman George Cormack who has helped direct the Broadmeadows
fortunes for the past two years hopes to continue turning out top show
and sale animals from Chesters Farm.
He has leased two of the large cattle sheds which he will use as the
basis for a business geared to helping owners who are keen to show or
breed pedigree cattle.
He already has four lots of beasts under his care and, immediately
after Saturday's dispersal sale, he will be off to the Isle of Man to
advise a breeder there.
''We can handle about 22 bulls here but I will also visit individual
farms to offer advice on diet and preparing cattle for a show or sale,''
said George. ''Over the years I have gained a lot of experience about
the mineral requirements of all types of pedigree cattle. Things have
changed and the natural minerals seem to be drained out of the soil now
-- but for pedigree cattle they are essential.''
The length of time that candidates for the show or sale rings have to
spend under George's care at Chesters will vary. Some may need to come
in for six months, others may only be half that.
He sees his new enterprise as offering a service to owners who want to
harness the skills of an expert stockman but who cannot aspire to
employing someone full-time.
He has performed a similar service already for friends -- a
professional couple in Hampshire who breed cattle as a sideline and send
him their animals for finishing in advance of the show season.
Before joining the Broadmeadows herd as stockman, George had been a
partner in the Ashley Aberdeen Angus herd at South Queensferry and he
admits that Aberdeen Angus were his first love.
Over the years he has been won over by the Limousins. They have a lot
of character and are intelligent, he said. ''They are really attractive
animals.''
His son David is also a well known stockman, working in Yorkshire.
Initially it was David that Douglas Crighton went after but he had just
bought a house and settled his children in school and did not want to
move.
He suggested an approach to his father which is how George, rather
than thinking of retiral, is launching out on a new business venture.

Scientists have key role to explain
BOB Stevenson, the recently elected president of the British
Veterinary Association, has no doubts about the priority topic in his
year of office -- animal welfare.
Consumer pressure -- or more accurately animal welfare lobby pressure
-- has brought it to the forefront of many political agendas and he sees
veterinary surgeons and allied scientists as having a key role in
sorting out the truths from the misconceptions.
''We need much more evidence about what welfare is and how to relate
it to the different animals, whether it is about calves being
transported or a haul of sheep in a lorry or pigs going abroad or even
puppy farms.
''We need much more measurement. We know what cruelty is, but when it
comes to good, not so good, poor or bad welfare, veterinary surgeons are
the custodians of animal welfare and we must make subjective judgments
in favour of the animal.
''But when it gets into the grey areas, such as inter-species
comparisons and reactions to transportation, we need appropriate
measurements.
''We need better science to tell us whether these animals are in
trouble. We are getting there but we are not getting there fast enough.
I don't think there is enough money going into that side of the welfare
story.''
He is intent on ensuring the BVA ''makes a better fist'' of arriving
at an improved policy on welfare in the coming year.
But he has other concerns. These range across the standard of
veterinary teaching, of policing the disease threat posed by the single
European market and livestock movements, of demands made on vets, and of
having the right tools in the shape of approved drugs to do the job.
At the same time he has to fulfil the demands of being senior partner
in a nine-person mixed practice in Usk, Gwent.
He has several advantages. First of all he looks and sounds like a
vet, with a quiet reassuring manner. Secondly, he has a wide
geographical knowledge of the countryside and its people. (He was born
in Carlisle, raised and educated in South Wales, trained at Glasgow
University, and practised in South-west England before returning to
Wales). And he has taken an active role in teaching and advisory work.
He also looks like a rugby player, which he was with a ''blue'' from
Glasgow University and appearances with a number of sides since
graduation. This gave way to squash and more recently to mountain
biking.
His upbringing at Penarth is remembered fondly as are his years at
Glasgow. ''I just got in by the skin of my teeth but the great Professor
Weipers seemed to think I had something and he became my mentor and I
made damned sure I was going to stay there and graduate.''
But he feels there are fewer veterinary teachers in undergraduate
education.
''There are more scientists now, perhaps even genetic engineers,
microbiologists and the like. There are fewer vets with experience from
being out in the field and I am slightly anxious about this. We need the
specialists but we also need the clinical vets.
''We need to watch that the universities do not have all these
molecular biologist-type people for what money they can bring into the
university. People are looking for that kind of research to develop
commercially and companies say to the university they will support that
kind of work.''
Although he graduated in 1966, Mr Stevenson has stayed in touch with
the academic side and for the past 20 years or so has been a guest
lecturer at a county agricultural college and an external examiner of
final year veterinary students. His empathy with and even sympathy for
students and young graduates is obvious.
''They have a terrific challenge throughout their five years; lots and
lots of examinations. They come out absolutely stuffed full with
knowledge.
''But I am concerned we are not making the best use of all that in
some circumstances. Suddenly they come out into veterinary work and
doing a job which they thought was going to be part of the same
on-going, learning, hi-tech conveyor belt they jumped on when they were
18.
''Instead they come into contact with suspicious old farmers who may
ask them if they are real vets because they look so young. And then they
present them with 10 lame cows and 10 PDs (pregnancy diagnoses) to deal
with.
''Many just did not realise what the job was going to be like,
although they have to spend 26 weeks with practising vets during their
courses.''
He sees a need for closer integration of vet theory and practise at an
early stage with students ''shadowing'' vets for 24 hours at a time just
to find out what it is like at a sharp end of the business.
''They have to find out what the job is; and it is a fascinating
job,'' he says. And he means it.

MANY dairy farmers could be at risk of losing thousands of pounds
because they no not realise that farm insurance does not always cover
the contents of semen storage flasks, according to the Ayrshire-based
cattle breeding support service Sefax.
Semen is unlikely to be covered by existing farm policies, although
the cost of equipment failure is usually covered by the flask
manufacturer for the first 24 months following purchase, says Sefax vet
Peter MacLaren.
''A farm with a 100-cow herd could quite easily have 150-200 semen
straws in store, and if the semen is worth about #20 per straw the value
is more than #2000,'' he said. Sefax estimates that many farmers are
using storage flasks which are more than ten years old.
Meanwhile, the Kingshay Farming Trust, has suggested that up to #1100
a year could be saved by the average 100-cow dairy herd if better
precautions were taken against milk fever.
''We found that the majority of herds which were fed a magnesium
supplement have below-average milk fever incidence,'' said project
specialist Richard Simpson. However, magnesium was only one of a number
of important factors.
* Britain's dairy farmers have told the Milk Development Council that
infertility, mastitis and lameness should be the top priorities for
research and development projects funded from their levy payments.

THE boys are still fuming over what is now called the ''famine
relief''. It isn't that they mind the #35m due to them in acreage
payments being paid early as compensation for recent flood damage. They
are still boiling at the way the headlines made it seem like that was
another hand-out at the taxpayer's expense.
Mossie's so annoyed that he's found a way to spite them. He's refusing
to bank the cheque. ''No, no. I still haven't been paid,'' he said.
''Sending a cheque doesn't constitute payment. They still owe me the
money as long as it's not in my account.''
He's quite right, of course, but I don't suppose the Government is
impressed. He could have that money into British Gas shares yielding
7.8% if only he felt he could trust Cedric Brown. Anyway, Mossie has
shown himself a man of principle and he is not going to let the
Government discharge it's debt to him a month early if it is to be
presented to the public as an extra subsidy for famine relief.
For some reason his gesture reminds me of my pal Charlie Kirton who,
when he was 13, took the greatest pride in getting the bus conductor to
accept a full-fare whereas those of his pals who were already 14 went to
equal lengths to deceive the clippie into letting them go as a half.
I, on the other hand, have had no problems about whether to cash in my
famine relief. It has not arrived.
This was no surprise to me, I'm afraid. It would not be retaliation
for offering my thanks for nothing to the Government. It would be
because of a perfectly innocent little mistake made in my AICS form. I
had awarded myself an extra acre of setaside. In all those subsidies,
what is an extra #130, I ask you?
It is a field the size of which was unknown. It had been made from
four fields by removing the dikes. Also, one of the four fields had
given up five building plots since it was measured and another was at
the junction of four Ordinance Survey maps, one of which was missing.
The consultant who helped me with my first AICS form-filling had
recommended claiming 21 acres and I had always done that.
But this year I noticed that a contractor had been charging me for 24
acres every time he went into that park. Now, everyone says the most
accurate measure of the true acreage of a field is the seed drill so I
asked the contractor.
''Has your drill been measuring 24 acres in the Sunnybrae Park,
Davie?''
After a pause for careful thought, the Man of Few Words said, ''Aye''.
That meant an average of more than #400 a year going down the sink.
I was scared to got the whole hog. After all, they can take away all
your grants if they catch you making inaccurate claims. Indeed, it is
said the local department lads have no discretion in the matter
nowadays. But I felt quite confident in going for 23 acres -- until I
had done it and sent off the forms.
The Red Rooster assured me that the computer would throw out my
application as soon as it saw the envelope. ''You canna increase the
size of a park and hope they won't notice nowadays, Charlie. You're for
the high jump.''
And Mossie was a great comfort, ''Aye, I doubt it's 'Farm for Sale'
right enough. I wonder if the Irishman has still got that sign.''
The Farmer's life became a nightmare. He had no nightmares as such
because he couldn't sleep, but the phone made him jump, he had to screw
up his courage to open the mail and strange cars coming up the road
induced a panic attack.
Eventually the Irishman's advice was taken.
''Wouldn't it be an idea to find out what the size of that field is,
Charlie, before ye crack up altogether? There's a wee man comes out from
the college and stands in the middle of the field shooting lasers at
each corner. He gives you an exact measurement. I've had the whole farm
done. Sure, with my overdraft, I couldn't be worrying about my forms as
well.''
That was it. I would find the truth and that would set my mind at
rest. Next year I'd put in for the full 24 acres. Who knows? It could be
more.
And the man from the college came with his laser and did indeed
measure the park. Unfortunately he made it 22.8 acres. With the margins
he should have left for dike sides, the Farmer was clearly in trouble.
Now my tale hath another side to it.
I have a longstanding friend who has had an extremely expensive
fallout with his American wife. Stupidly, he had the fallout in the
American courts. The fight started over #28m and he has been left, in
the words of the bothy ballad, ''wi' his sark and drawers.''
Well, not quite. He was also left with the family Cadillac.
So, when he phoned up the other day, it was for a loan, or would I
take the Cadillac?
Reasoning that a gas-guzzling car was the last thing a broke friend
needed, and thinking that, if I took the car, at least I would be sure
of that, I went for it.
It wasn't dear but can't you just see the headlines? ''Famine Relief
Farmer Buys Cadillac.'' Little do they know that the Farmer's famine
relief is in jeopardy.

THE Muiresk flock of pedigree Suffolk sheep, owned by Kenny and Bruce
Mair, from Kinnermit, near Turriff, continued its great run of success
on Saturday in Edinburgh's Gorgie Mart with a select draft of females
attracting a run of high prices.
Top price was 5800gns for a gimmer which sold to Iain Barbour,
Beechgrove, Annan. Mr Barbour also took two more at 5500gns and 5000gns
before completing his purchases with another at 2100gns. Another also
made 5500gns selling to T A Irwin &amp; Son, Lower Kingstree, Umberleigh,
Devon.
Two made 4000gns, firstly to Nick Layton, Parkgate, Hereford, and then
to John Sinnett, Stockton Court, Worcester, while one sold at 3200gns to
Jock Allan, Hillhead of Covington, Biggar.
Several Northern Ireland breeders were present with S M Ligget from
Carnoy, County Tyrone, taking three Muiresk gimmers at 2500gns, 2300gns,
and 2100gns while Baggrave Farms, Leicester, took one at 2800gns.
Clair Drummond, Straid, Girvan, took another at 2100gns. Two Muiresk
gimmers are also bound for Belgium at 2000gns and 1500gns while J &amp; T
Bell, Cormaddie, Dumfries, went to 2000gns for another.
The 54 Muiresk gimmers averaged #1792.56 while ewes from the flock
sold to a top of 1200gns to produce an overall average of #1583.65 for
71 head.
The Glenisla flock of Gordon Wilson from Bogs of Paithnick, Keith,
also enjoyed a sound trade with gimmers selling to a top of 5000gns for
one which sold to Derek Henderson, Finney Hill Green, Hexham, who also
took a four-crop ewe from the same home at 1200gns, while other gimmers
sold to 1100gns to Blair Dufftown, Mains of Drumdollo, Huntly, and then
at 1300gns to Muiresk. The Glenisla consignment of 62 returned an
overall average of #642.35.
A similar draft from Sandy Lee of Fordafourie, Fraserburgh, had a top
of 3000gns for a gimmer which sold to Muiresk, with others selling to
2400gns to Ian Gilmour, Humeston, Maybole, and 2100gns to Baggrave
Farms.
One crop ewes from Fordafourie sold twice to 1000gns with both going
to T Adams &amp; Son, Penyrheol, Cowbridge, South Glamorgan. Seventy-three
head from Fordafourie averaged #570.16. The auctioneers were J Swan &amp;
Sons.

WANTED, site for expansion is the sign Blair Macnaughton is tempted to
put up in Pitlochry's main street.
The Macnaughton family have been in business in Pitlochry since the
family moved there in 1835, and Blair Macnaughton, the managing director
of the family group of companies is concerned that the business will be
forced to expand outside of the town.
''We are desperately looking for a site in Pitlochry for expansion
purposes,'' said Macnaughton, ''we would expect to expand at the rate of
at least five jobs per year for the next five years, and these would be
non-tourist industry positions.''
The managing director has reshaped the family company since he
returned from Australia in 1987 to take over the running of the family
business.
''When I came back we did not have one PC in the office now we have 30
PCs for use by our staff of 70,'' said Mr Macnaughton, as an example of
how the company has modernised.
The company now operates in three distinct divisions catering from the
retailing of traditional Highland dress and tartans for the tourist
industry to providing corporate wear for major companies.
Their Isle Mill in Keith weaves tartan not only for the kilt market
but also the upholstery industry.
Mr Macnaughton was delighted when the corporate wear division won the
contract earlier this year for supplying the new uniforms for all Bank
of Scotland staff.
''The fabric required for this order was 110 kilometres long which
meant that it stretched from our head office in Pitlochry to the Bank of
Scotland's HQ on The Mound in Edinburgh,'' said Macnaughton.
The company founded by Blair Macnaughton's great, great, great
grandfather in 1785 is expanding on all fronts.
''The company was actually founded in 1785 in Aberfeldy but moved to
Pitlochry in 1835 which for some reason is the date we always refer to
it as having been established,'' explained Blair Macnaughton.
In 1991 the Macnaughton Group launched the Flower of Scotland tartan,
and it is now their biggest seller outselling the Royal Stewart.
This year the Group launched the Alexander MacNaughton Collection of
tartan accessories, and have joined the Links of Scotland trade group
which markets Scottish golfing equipment and accessories throughout the
world.
''We have invested #100,000 in this product, and believe it has a big
future in countries such as Japan. We will be launching it in America in
January at a major golf industry exhibition in Orlando.''
The upholstery side of the business is also about to start selling in
America and Germany.
''We have barely touched the overseas market with our upholstery,''
said Mr Macnaughton, ''although our tartans obviously sell in America,
and indeed in Germany where we already kit out two pipe bands, but our
upholstery business is going to rocket in America.''
In the UK the Macnaughton Group supplies upholstery covers to hotels,
offices, and oil rigs, and Blair Macnaughton pointed to the coverings of
the seats we were sitting on in the Highlander Hotel in Aviemore saying:
''These are our covers.''

GORDON Kee first entered business in 1969 when he joined the Clyde
Associated group of companies his father started seventeen years
earlier.
The string of Clyde Associated companies were involved in numerous
activities, ranging from engineering to estate agency, but six years ago
Gordon Kee founded Golden Charter, which has since become Britain's
largest funeral planning network.
The company now has 600 agents and links with 1400 funeral directors.
Mr Kee runs the UK network from his office in Bearsden on the
outskirts of Glasgow, and lives only two minutes from the office.
The expansion of Golden Charter has meant says, Mr Kee, that some of
the other family interests have been sold or wound down. This is allow
him time to concentrate on the funeral planning business.
Running Golden Charter, he admits, has also forced him to become
involved in the politics of big business, as the concept of funeral
planning has attracted controversy.
''In October 1992 I went to the Office of Fair Trading as I thought
there was a lack of regulation in the industry,'' Mr Kee said.
The OFT subsequently published a report, and the chief executive of
Golden Charter welcomed that it highlighted some of the problems of self
regulation.
''I expect the DTI will now progress the matter, and I see the funeral
planning market moving towards becoming a mature free market offering
the public security of funds.''
To highlight the need for some control of the industry Mr Kee points
to the fact that he believes that within the next 15 years #5bn could be
under management to provide for people's funerals.
Despite the demands of overseeing a rapidly expanding business
involving regular trips to London, Mr Kee believes in relaxing whenever
he can.
''If I can mix business and pleasure then I do so. There is now stress
in business that was not there twenty years ago,'' he says, ''because of
the advance in communications.''
His leisure time pursuits include sailing on the Clyde, clay pigeon,
or game shooting.
''I am part of a syndicate which has a 2000-acre estate at Arnprior
where we shoot pheasant, and I involve myself in the British Field
Sports Society,'' he says.

IT could be said that Ram Leisure had modest beginnings. The first
order Mike Wilson the founder of the company received was for 24
T-shirts.
That was a decade ago, and the 24 T-shirts has led to a #1m a year
business.
''My first order was for Aberdeen District Council. There was only
myself and a part-time girl involved in the company at that time, and I
was delighted to get the order. Our turnover in the first year was only
#22,000,'' said Mike Wilson.
Ram Leisure, based in Aberdeen now produces 200,000 printed T-shirts
every year, as well as pens, and key rings for the corporate identity
market.
''We are a promotional gift house,'' said Mike Wilson, ''but the
tourist side to our business now accounts for 30% of our turnover, and
is growing.''
Ram Leisure, like so many other parts of Scotland's commercial life
has benefited from Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in the firm
Braveheart.
''We have done a William Wallace T-shirt, and it is selling like
hotcakes,'' said Mr Wilson. ''While the film has also helped to increase
our export orders as anything with tartan in it is popular at the
moment.''
The company already exports to a number of countries, including
Singapore and Japan, and nearer home, Norway, Denmark, and Holland.
However Mike Wilson believes that there is still a lot of orders his
company can get in Scotland, particularly in the Central Belt.
''Being based in Aberdeen we are not so well know in the Central Belt
but we are now trying to overcome this problem,'' he says.
Being situated in the North-east means that Ram Leisure does a lot of
business with the whisky companies who have distilleries in the Spey
Valley, and also North Sea oil companies.
''We do a lot of work for the drinks industry,'' said Wilson,'' and we
recently received an order for 200 T-shirts from the owner of a company
who was having a part in Nassau, and wanted us to deliver the shirts
over there within a week. We managed it, if fact we were a day early.''
Ram Leisure's biggest order to date was supplying the merchandise for
the Talls Ships Race including the inevitable T-shirt, baseball hats,
teddy bears and coffee mugs.

RESULTS
SOME OF the UK's largest companies publish their results this week.
British Airways kicks off today and is expected to show the benefits of
strong growth in passenger numbers.
City anlaysts are forecasting an increase in half-yearly profits from
a restated #349m to as much as #438m. The dividend is expected to rise
by a hefty 10-14% to as much as 4.0p.
Tomorrow, BP's third-quarter figures are expected to show a surge in
net income. A strong improvement in its chemicals business should see
net income rise to #513m from #390m previously.
Recent entrant BSkyB annouces its first-quarter figures also on
Tuesday. Analysts will be concentrating on how many new customers it has
signed up.
In what is a busy day for company results, drinks group Allied Domecq
is expected to post flat results excluding restructuring provisions.
Economic problems in Mexico will depress the group's profits. Further
negative factor have been the loss of earnings from food disposals and
overcapacity in the UK beer market.
Britain's biggest stores group, Marks &amp; Spencer, is forecast to
produce only a modest rise in half-yearly profits, hit by continued weak
consumer confidence and cut throat competition in the High Street.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits to range from #375m to #385m against
#354m previously. Food sales are expected to show higher growth than
clothing.
A warm autumn will have reduced demand for its winter merchandise. On
the Continent, price-cutting initiatives to boost trade will have taken
their toll on profits which are forecast to have possibly halved.
Another disappointing contribution is expected from Brooks Brothers in
the US.
Britain's biggest electricity generator, National Power, which is in
the process of taking over Southern Electric in a #2800m deal, is on
course for a sharp improvement in half-year earnings.
Taxable profits are likely to have risen to #250m from #211m. While
the hot weather will have reduced domestic demand income form overseas
should be markedly higher. The interim dividend could rise to 5.1p from
4.35p.
Wednesday sees interims from tobacco group BAT Industries which are
expected to show further growth in overseas markets and benefits from
the consolidation of American Tobacco.
Its UK insurance business Eagle Star will have benefited from strong
equity markets but life and pensions subsidiary Allied Dunbar still
faces depressed traing conditions. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of
#610m-#635m against #549m previously.
A guide to the strength of retail demand in the High Street will be
apparent in figures from Burton Group to be published on Thursday.
On the same day, Merrill Lynch expects BT to show a second quarter
profit of #790m, up over a tenth. News of how many customers it is
losing to cable operators will be closely analysed. The interim dividend
is expected to rise from 7.05p to 7.4p.

Harry Conroy considers four companies who having enjoyed the taste of
success are looking for more.
DENIS Critchley-Salmonson is wearing a huge grin these days which is
understandable when you hear that Strathmore Mineral Water, of which he
is managing director, more than doubled its sales last year when
compared on a year on year basis.
Cynics might assumes that the 137% increase was down to the
never-ending summmer we experienced this year.
''Our tremendous summer weather did account for between 20 and 30% of
this increase,'' said Mr Critchley-Salmonson.
The remaining 100% plus increase in sales was due to the company's
success in the clear water market, he said.
''We have 40% of the clear market in the UK,'' said Mr
Critchley-Salmonson, ''and this is because we were the first company to
bring it into the mainstream marketplace. It was a very overpriced
market and we introduced a 1.5 litre bottle which sold at 99p.''
Strathmore's success has meant that a third shift, which was
introduced to deal with seasonal demand will be kept on, thus creating
14 permanent jobs at the company's bottling plant in Forfar.
Strathmore's success story also means that it has more than 50% of the
sparkling water market in the grocery trade in Scotland while it
accounts for a staggering 75% of the water sold on licensed premises.
Mr Denis Critchley-Salmonson plans to consolidate and build upon the
company's position in the clear water market when he adds mandarin to
the flavours already on offer.
''I can assure you it is a very special drink,'' he said, ''we have
got a drink that tastes like mandarin. It will prove to be very
popular.''
To meet the additional demand Strathmore, which is part of the Matthew
Clark Gamer group are investing #1m, which will double its potential
bottle blowing capacity from 6000 to 12,000 bottles a hour.
He smiles when you ask him if the source of the water will be able to
keep up with demand.
''Our yield is 2.4 litres a second, and we are taking water from
saturated sandstone which runs through the Strathmore hills at the foot
of the Grampians. It is like a giant sponge, and we are hardly even
squeezing it.''
The water Strathmore is currently bottling probably fell on mother
earth more than 50 years ago and the supply is virtually inexhaustable.
Exports account for around 10% of Strathmore's total sales with
markets in USA, Russia, Japan, Italy, and Cyprus, but Mr
Critchley-Salmonson says that the export market is not one of the
company's prime objectives.
The aim is to penetrate every corner of the UK market through the
large multiple store groups.

Study shows EU support.
AN authoritative survey of businessmen to be published today is
expected to show a large majority in favour of a single currency in the
European Union.
Produced by the Confederation of British Industry and the British
Chambers of Commerce, the survey is believed to show that only a fifth
of respondents were actually opposed to British participation in a
single currency.
According to the Sunday Times, the majority were in favour or did not
want Britain to rule out joining in should other countries proceed.
Businessmen are attracted by the practical advantages of having a
single currency when more and more of Britain's trade is with other EU
countries and by the reduced volatility that a single currency would
have compared with the tossings and turnings of sterling. Enthusiasts
maintain that it would improve Europe's economic growth rate.
The new survey will help Prime Minister John Major to counter the
European sceptics in his party, though not all industry bodies are in
favour of a single currency.
The Institute of Directors is not keen and doesn't believe Britain
would be in a position to consider membership of such a club for many
years.
It argues that a single currency is not as much an advantage as it is
for the countries in the vanguard of the idea, Germany, France, Austria
and Benelux, as less than a third of UK trade is with these core
countries.
However there is no doubting the importance of EU trade. Last year
56.8% of exports and imports related to EU countries, up from 55.8% in
1993. Official statistics shows that trade with France, Germany and
Benelux accounted for 37% of total trade last year.
Data highlighted in the latest Bank of England Quarterly to be
published this week will show that the proportion of outward investment
going to the EU compared with America has increased in recent years.
In the late 1980s flows to North America were twice what they were to
Western Europe. The position was more than reversed in the three year to
1992, though admittedly in 1993 the flows were almost equal. Inward
investment showed a similar pattern.
The article points out that generally investment has been lower in
recent years so that Britain's external assets as a proportion of gross
domestic product have fallen sharply, from over 25% in 1986 to just 5%
last year. Total external assets are put at #1400bn, slightly ahead of
liabilities.
The mid-1980s were an exception, with Britain being the world's
largest outward direct investor on the back of a mergers and
acquisitions boom in the US. Many of these deals later proved to be more
of a liability than an asset.

<HEADLINE>Taking arsenic to avoid National Insurance contributions</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975519879</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TOP executives are being invited to take arsenic -- as a bonus.
The poison is being offered as a staff benefit to managers intent on
avoiding National Insurance contributions.
Two-year-old racehorses, greyhounds, Persian carpets, and exotic
metals are other non-taxable Christmas options for City high-flyers.
Tax experts say the Government has not succeeded with a long-running
campaign to close the loopholes for dodgers of the earnings tax which
underpins the welfare state.
Most of the leading accountants, including KPMG, Touche Ross, Price
Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, are selling advice on NIC schemes.
Employers which arrange payments in kind instead of cash are not
liable for the 10.2% levy.
Mr Jim Yuill, director of social services at accountants Ernst &amp;
Young, said a Newmarket trainer specialised in selling racehorses as
''executive perks'', and powdered platinum was a ''quite widespread''
bonus in the City.
''We are talking about bonuses paid by City institutions and
family-owned firms that are well into six figures -- #250,000 and
upwards. This type of scheme would hardly be worthwhile for anything
less,'' he said.
''A company paying out half a million can save itself #50,000.''
Top City firms are estimated to have made bonus payments totalling
#500m last year -- costing the Exchequer up to #50m in unpaid National
Insurance.
Until 1991, bonuses were often paid in unit trusts at a cost to the
public purse of up to #1bn a year. The Treasury put a stop to that
scheme.
Two years ago, after companies increased the stakes by paying some
staff in gold bars, the Government intervened again.
But companies then moved into diamonds, fine wines, and luxury
shopping vouchers.
Last April, Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley plugged these
loopholes, and blocked bonus payments in any commodity traded on a
recognised investment exchange.
The tax avoidance industry returned to the drawing board to find new
vehicles such as pre-retirement benefit schemes, antiques, and strategic
metals.
Metals trader CAL Futures in the City of London, itemised the poison
as An Alternative To Wine among a list of 16 rare metals it offered in a
letter to tax accountants.
Tax specialists said any commodity could suffice, so long as it had no
''spot'' price nor trading arrangements enabling exchange for a
guaranteed amount of cash.
The recipient of a noxious bonus can say ''That'll do nicely, thank
you'' without ever having to lay hand or eye on the stuff -- the
racehorse may remain in its stable and the arsenic, antimony, chrome, or
titanium need never be moved from the bonded warehouses of Rotterdam.
The employer presents the favoured employee with title to the goods
and telephone numbers for the specialist dealers who may be willing to
exchange them for cash.

NORTH Sea oil output bounced back strongly in September, according to
the Royal Bank of Scotland. This should boost the industrial production
figures, due this morning, though its manufacturing component is
expected to remain lack lustre.
Economists at James Capel, the City stockbrokers, are forecasting
growth of 0.6% in industrial production in September. This would result
in the year-on-year increase edging up from 1% in August to 1.1%.
Manufacturing output is forecast to gain 0.2% on the month to give a
year-on-year advance of 1.4% against 1.3% in August. Capel's Adam Cole
pointed out that if the industrial production figures were substantially
wide of the mark, it could result in a revision to third quarter GDP
growth, provisionally estimated at 0.5%.
Now that the Governor of the Bank of England has dropped his
insistence on the need for a rise in interest rates, the quarterly
bulletin and inflation report, due on Wednesday, may prove less
contentious than on the two previous occasions.
Looking two years ahead to beyond the next General Election, the Bank
may be able to forecast that underlying inflation will have dropped
below 2.5% in line with the Government's target.
One problem to be resolved is the treatment of the #50 rebates payable
to households in England and Wales, but not Scotland, from the proceeds
of the National Grid flotation.
If these are included in official inflation calculations it would have
the effect of reducing rates by up to 1.5% in the first quarter of next
year and increasing them by the same amount the following year.
It would be more satisfactory if the Central Statistical Office
treated them as an aberration and relegated them to a statistical
footnote.
TODAY -- Industrial production (September).
TOMORROW -- None announced.
WEDNESDAY -- Bank of England quarterly bulletin.
THURSDAY -- None announced.
FRIDAY -- CBI distributive trades survey (October).

TWO former ICI executives who led a management buyout of a specialised
business from the chemical group, are shortly to take their company
public.
Peter Rowley and David Hummel led the buyout of the Victrex PEEK
operation in 1993, assisted by CVC Capital Partners and various banks.
Victrex is the only commercial producer of polyetheretherketone, a
high-performance engineering plastic.
The company sells 97% of its production outside the UK, the major
markets being the US, Japan and Germany.
Growth has been rapid since the buyout, with operating profits rising
46% to #10.2m in the year to September, on sales of #31.3m, up 33%.
Baring Brothers and Cazenove will be sponsor and stockbroker
respectively to the flotation which will be by way of placing and

LIFE in the former German Democratic Republic is not easy for its
fledgling businessmen, now part of a unified Germany, who have had to
face up to the unknown in the form of a free market economy after years
of being protected by the state.
Dr Eberhard Knauss, the 48-year-old managing director of Berliner
Behlater &amp; Anlagenbau, firm which manufactures metal containers in what
was East Berlin, has first hand experience of how hard it is.
He had to carry out a management buy out and see his firm, which in
the days of the GDR had a workforce of around 320, face up to
redundancies which reduced it to 60 workers. But, as he admits, he gets
the same productivity from the remaining 60 as he did from the 320.
The new world after the fall of the wall in 1990 presented real
problems, especially as suddenly the East German manufacturers were
confronted with something they had not been told about -- the appalling
condition of the economy of the GDR.
''We did not have any markets to sell to any more,'' he said. ''The
ones in Eastern Europe were there no longer and as a consequence we had
to do two things -- reduce our prices drastically so we could compete
with world market prices, and cut our workforce.''
He decided that the only way for the company to survive was a
management buy out, but could not find a partner and had to go it alone
with the help of the Trust Agency, which was set up to oversee the
changeover to a market economy in for former GDR.
''I was not led by great ideas or visions,'' he said. ''I did not want
to become an entrepreneur, just to keep the firm alive. I had to lay off
250 people. If I had not done so the remaining 60 workers would have had
to go too.
''It is not the ideal form of survival, but it may lead to that
desired aim. If today I am asked how we are doing, I say we are still
here. We exist.
''We have seen the ups and downs of a market economy. We have also
seen that western companies do not always stick to their contracts. They
were only interested in us as long as they thought they could make use
of us.
''But I have managed to establish stable orders and contacts and I
have tried to find new products.''
Dr Knauss, the sole shareholder, made clear it was not a means of
getting rich quick. ''In 1990 I changed 10,000 marks into Deutschmarks.
I had been working in the GDR for over 25 years and that resulted in
10,000 marks. It is not a lot.
''There is nobody behind me who will support me, but there are
Government measures aimed at supporting companies like this and without
them we would not have survived.
''Would I do it again? If you are prepared to work more than 15 hours
a day, including weekends, and are, ideally single, and have the
necessary willingness to take risks this is something to go for.''
His daily struggle was keeping the company alive. He was sceptical
about the value of West German managers coming into companies like his.
They did not know the workforce.
''The problems they had to face were completely different from those
in the West. He believed it was easier for an East German who knew the
workers ways, and said that last year a West German he had employed in
middle management had caused damage worth 200,000 marks to his company.
''The sales strategy I have has been devised by myself,'' he said.
''It is to keep my order books full for three months in advance.
''I have been thinking of employing a sales manager, but he would have
to get paid 150,000 DM and to justify that he would have to secure
orders worth three million DM and that would mean my turnover having to
increase from six million DM to nine million DM and I doubt whether my
production facilities would have the capacity.
''During the years of the GDR we had experience of turning necessity
into a virtue, something people in the West might be lacking in. We have
learned to make something from very little and in this particular case
with very little management we are trying to run an enterprise.
''There was no incentive in the GDR to increase productivity. You got
the price for your goods and it was up to the export company to sell
them. They got DM, we got local prices fixed by the National Price
Fixing Authority.
''The planned economy always worked from the fact that there was a
lack of things. The price did not matter. No pressure was exercised on
costs. Things were produced anyway. Whether you produced more or less
did not matter and supply and demand were not taken into account.''

Buenos Aires, Sunday -- Leaders of the Group of 15 developing nations,
seeking to break with what many see as the inertia of the past, gather
here tomorrow with a mandate to boost trade and investment and
incorporate new partners.
''International relations are not a question of rhetoric,''
Argentina's Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said yesterday after a first
round of talks with G15 colleagues.
Current G15 members are Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal,
Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
Di Tella urged the group, set up in 1990, to drop a confrontational
approach toward the Group of Seven rich nations (the United States,
Canada, Japan, Germany, Britain, Italy, and France) and concentrate on
trade and co-operation.
Chilean officials said that despite the group's laudable aims for
South-South co-operation, this approach did not have a good track record
for getting things done.
However, delegates said the incorporation of new emerging markets to
the group and the planned creation of a Co-operation in Investment,
Trade, and Technology agreement to boost such exchanges among members
should help the situation.
South Africa, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand were
singled out by G15 Foreign Ministers during weekend talks as the most
likely candidates to join the group.
The final decision will be made by G15 Presidents and Prime Ministers,
who will hold their fifth annual meeting tomorrow and Tuesday.
The agreement should help identify barriers to trade, investment and
technology transfer and provide a plan to abolish them, said Malaysia's
Permanent Representative to Geneva Haron Siraj, who heads his country's
delegation.
In a thinly veiled criticism of US opposition Republican leaders who
complain free trade with Mexico is hurting the American labour market,
the G15 document is expected to reject the notion that free trade can be
a cause of unemployment.--Reuter

GLASGOW has been, for some time, the top destination for conferences
in Scotland. The city is standing up well in an international market
that has been slowing down or, in Europe's case, in decline.
Glasgow City Council is now engaged in the construction of a
3000-delegate conference centre on the SECC site. This #30m facility,
complementing the already popular venue, will have the flexibility and
state-of-the-art technology to cater for the high specifications many
conferences require.
The council regards this expenditure as vital to take our business
tourism product into the next century. It enables Glasgow to compete as
a venue with similar centres throughout the world and make the most of
the large-scale conferences already secured, such as Rotary
International and the American Society of Travel Agents, both in 1997,
and major medical conferences in 1998 and 1999.
Some of the statistics about the city's conference market make
interesting reading -- #105m of conference business has been secured in
the past eight years and a consultant's report estimates it is worth
approximately #33m per year to the local economy.
An even more important factor is that business tourism represents the
highest per-head expenditure in the whole of the tourism sector --
#527.17 per visit as opposed to #477.22 for all other visits.
The value of conferences already arranged and projected into the next
century is very significant, not just to Glasgow, but to the West of
Scotland and, indeed, the whole of the Scottish economy. In 1994, the
Convention Bureau of Greater Glasgow Tourist Board secured 222 new
conferences to the area, worth some #23m to the local economy over the
next seven years.
Conferences are not just about expenditure however, they are about the
opportunity to provide additional incentives -- 20% of delegates bring
partners who could benefit from add-on packages and many look for pre
and post-conference tours, widening the tourism perspective. The
delegates, of course, benefit from Glasgow's diverse business base,
building links for the future, while establishing the city as an
international business centre.
Junior Chamber International's 50th World Congress is an example of
all these ingredients.
It will bring significant income to the city from its more than 4000
delegates. Its programme includes opportunities for the city's business
sector to make a range of contacts on their own doorsteps with the
decision-makers of the future. Add-on programmes are offered for those
who wish. The emphasis of the whole programme is high quality to ensure
that those decision-makers not only enjoy their visit to the city but
will wish to return both for business and pleasure.
The council is committed to supporting such international conferences.
We constantly strive to make Glasgow the first choice for conference
organisers and we can help them deliver their programme. We have fully
supported Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce through the bid process to
host the world congress and the actual event itself.
Investment, too, in new hotels, the airport expansion, new facilities
at the SECC, all add to the package to ensure we can compete and
continue to beat the best that the rest can offer.
One of this city's greatest assets is its people. Many businesses
locate here because of the able and willing workforce. The organisers of
the world congress have shown themselves not just to be more than able
and willing but true ambassadors for Glasgow. The should be
congratulated on their outstanding efforts.
With organisations like Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce helping to
bring such prestigious events to the city the future is promising.
Glasgow will continue to be a major player in the international market
as a conference destination bringing direct economic benefit in the
short term but providing the framework within which business contacts
can be made and the business climate can flourish.
Tom Monaghan is town clerk and chief executive of Glasgow City
Council.

THE 50th Junior Chamber International (JCI) World Congress opened in
Glasgow last night .
The theme of the week, ''Success Through Enterprise'', was repeated by
speakers at the opening ceremony in the city's Royal Concert Hall.
The Scottish Office Minister of State, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton,
said Glasgow had been an ''inspired choice'' of host city earning a
tremendous accolade for the whole of Scotland.
He welcomed the 3500 guests from around the world who crowded into the
auditorium for the celebrations.
He told them: ''I am sure no matter how long or short your stay, you
will experience the warmth of Glasgow's and Scotland's hospitality.
''The future prosperity of all nations depends on creating an
environment where enterprise is recognised, fostered, and supported.
''Scotland has long had a tradition of innovation and enterprise, in
the last century Scotland was a byword for engineering achievement,''
said Lord James.
He outlined Scotland's current economic success stories, including the
whisky industry and the ''rapid growth'' of hi-tech companies, and
highlighted overseas trade as an increasingly important part of the
economy.
Lord James added: ''We in Scotland are still international in our
outlook. Glasgow, with its Merchant City, is a part of that historic
tradition.'' He said that tradition was illustrated by Glasgow Junior
Chamber's successful bid to stage the world congress.
JCI world president David Oji said the organisation should work for
global peace and harmony.
He said: ''With ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, horrors in Rwanda and
disturbing violence in our own communities, the need for Junior Chamber
is even stronger.''
Mr Oji, a Japanese businessman, praised the work of chambers around
the world who provided aid and relief for victims of the Kobe earthquake
in his homeland. The quake registered 7.2 on the Richter scale and
claimed the lives of more than 6000 people in January.
He said: ''We recognise that earthquakes, fires, droughts, and wars
continue to cause pain and suffering to all of humanity. These disasters
also confirm for us that there is still much to do in this world.''
Mr Oji highlighted the benefits of improved communications through the
Internet. He hoped the Glasgow congress would be a success and the
following year would bring happiness to all members.
Congress chairman Duncan Tannahill said the world congress was last
held in Scotland in 1955, when Edinburgh hosted the event.
He said the congress had grown since then, when just several hundred
delegates would have attended.
He paid tribute to Glasgow's ''long and proud history of success in
innovation''.
The chairman of Glasgow Junior Chamber, Mr Niall McClure , said the
city's success around the world would only continue through hard work.
He added that Glasgow was proud of its people and their traditional
hospitality.
Glasgow Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall said the city was an ideal venue
for the congress. He added: ''The strength of this city relies on
heavily on its ability to work in partnership with others.''
And the convenor of Strathclyde Regional Council, William Perry, said
one goal of the authority and the junior chamber was to revitalise an
economy suffering the decline of traditional industries.
He added: ''A congress of this sort provides a unique opportunity for
the exchange of ideas and experience.''
The opening ceremony saw the introduction of dozens of past and
present office holders of the JCI. Current presidents, some in colourful
national costume, were cheered by groups from their home countries.
The ceremony closed with Scottish representatives sharing a quaich of
whisky with Mr Oji on stage.
Delegates from 63 countries attended, with the biggest foreign
contingent, of 1100 representatives, travelling from Japan.
A trade show is also being staged, with companies from Finland,
Denmark, Sweden, Austria, and Malta among those participating.
Organisers said the opening celebrations had been a great success.
They added that 1700 of the delegates had been taken to homes throughout
Glasgow after the opening ceremony to experience ''an evening of
traditional Scottish hospitality''.
During the week-long congress there will be seminars, training
exercises, business sessions, receptions, and parties. At the Scottish
party night it is hoped that 3500 people will take part in the world's
biggest ever ceilidh and earn themselves a place in the Guinness Book of
Records. Other congress venues include the Kelvin Hall and Kelvingrove
Art Gallery.
Glasgow won the bid to stage the event three years ago. It is expected
to generate #5m in tourism revenue and delegates will pack city hotels.
JCI is a worldwide organisation of young professionals and
entrepreneurs between the ages of 18 and 40. It aims to contribute to
the advancement of the global community by providing the opportunity for
young people to develop leadership skills, social responsibility,
fellowship, and entrepreneurial spirit.

ORGANISING dinner last night for 1800 people in around 700 homes as
far apart as Ayr, Kirkcaldy, Glasgow, and Edinburgh was a 10-month long
task for Mrs Shona MacLachlan, who juggled around a full-time job with
accountancy firm Ernst and Young and looking after her new baby.
The idea behind the ''home hospitality'' night, on the eve of the
congress, was to allow delegates from around the world the opportunity
to satisfy their curiousity over the inside of Scottish homes and
experience what was billed as a ''traditional'' Scottish meal of haggis,
neeps, and tatties, supplied through a sponsorship deal with Marks and
Spencer.
According to Mrs MacLachlan, wife of the congress's sponsorship
director, Mr David MacLachlan, co-ordinating a night's entertainment for
thousands of delegates had its nerve wracking moments, particularly
getting Glaswegians to commit themselves to hosting a dinner for
anything between four to a dozen strangers from Japan, South Korea,
Europe, the United States, Zimbabwe, and the Dominican Republic.
The scheme involved hiring a tour company to run 35 coaches from
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall to individual homes, public houses,
restaurants, and a couple of church halls along routes planned out with
military precision.
''People had no choice as to who they got and it proved hard to
fine-tune it to put delegates with people who could speak their
language. We also warned people that the delegates would arrive wearing
national costume so there wasn't an awkward moment if they opened their
front doors wearing jeans.
''Some of the people offering home hospitality have nothing to do with
the junior chamber but were keen to get involved. The real aim was to
give delegates a glimpse of homes in Scotland.''
Among those prepared to mash potatoes and cook turnips on a bank of
industrial ovens were members of the congregation of Killmerton Parish
Church in Bearsden, Glasgow. Around 100 guests were treated to a meal in
the church hall while being serenaded by a choir. However, since the
event took place on church premises, there was no alcohol allowed.
Delegates were also offered hospitality by Baldernock Church in
Milngavie, the Junior Chamber in Kirkcaldy, and individual members of
the West of Scotland Business Womens Clubs.

CATERING for more than 4000 young businessmen and women from around
the world attending the Junior Chamber International World Congress
dinners at various venues in Glasgow this week is a task that has fallen
on Glasgow City Council's catering unit, City Catering, and in
particular on the shoulders of its banqueting manager, Mr George Aitken.
Taking a break from putting the final touches to his plans, Mr Aitken
said the event was the largest catering challenge he had faced during
his time with the council, but he played down the task saying it was
simply a question of thinking in tens then multiplying.
During the next couple of days the Kelvin Hall sports centre in the
West End of the city will be stripped of its usual austere sporting
fixtures and filled with enough tables and chairs to seat the entire
congress for a party on Thursday night.
It promises to be the largest sit-down dinner held in Scotland
followed by a ceilidh which the organisers hope could find its way into
the record books.
Special booths covered with drapes are to be constructed from which a
stream of Scottish delicacies will be served to diners at tables
decorated by ice sculptures.
Two of the centre's sports arenas will be transformed into kitchens
complete with specially-hired ovens to re-heat meals prepared in the
City Catering kitchens in the City Chambers. Around 38,000 unbreakable
plastic glasses have been ordered, 12,000 of them with black stems
shipped in from America, and more than 1000lbs of beef bought from
suppliers.
At the banquet, delegates will sample some 16,000 Scottish canapes
including wild boar and juniper, Spey duck, Caledonian prawns, and
Highland pheasant, and consume around 12,000 open sandwiches. The food,
from 29 suppliers, will be prepared by 30 chefs and served by 400
waiters and waitresses divided into teams and supervised by a manager.
Mr Aitken revealed that a four-figure number of bottles of wine have
been ordered from the council cellars to quench the thirst of quests
attending a civic reception hosted by the Lord Provost. Careful
negotiations with the Lord Provost's office have resulted in another
up-market menu.
But lest taxpayers gasp in horror at the cost, he points out that his
catering team has provided around 200 temporary jobs. ''If we and our
suppliers do a good job with this then hopefully we will be considered
for other events in the future. It keeps people like me in a job.''
The clean-up operation in the Kelvin Hall after a banquet for Junior
Chamber presidents on Saturday night will be an equally gruelling task.
The arena must be back in use as a sports venue first thing on Monday
morning but cooking equipment and waste removed from the hall without
disrupting people living nearby.
''All the cans and bottles are being taken away for recycling and we
will take away the dishes after each course and then start dismantling
the kitchen.''
Next Monday morning, after, hopefully, events have run smoothly, Mr
Aitken said he intends to switch on his answer phone and disappear on
holiday.

GLASGOW Junior Chamber of Commerce first started working on the
concept of hosting a world congress five years ago.
A past chairman of the organisation, Mr Allan Currie, was the driving
force behind the original idea and the bid process. Having researched
the logistical capacity of Glasgow to host such an event, the official
declaration of intent to bid was made in Puerto Rico in 1990. Frankfurt
in Germany also declared its intention to bid.
There followed two years of hard work, negotiating advance bookings
with major venues, hotels, and contractors. An early setback was the
discovery that the SECC was at that time already booked for the 1995
Scottish Motor Show.
A bid budget of #50,000 was put to good use and compared modestly to
the Frankfurt budget of #250,000. At an early stage, both bid committees
agreed to work in a spirit of fair play and friendship, which was often
admired by the rest of the junior chamber world.
The climax of the bidding process was the World Congress in Miami,
where both teams had to present their cases.
With an enthusiastic delegation of 50 members -- including staff from
the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board, Glasgow Development Agency, Glasgow
City Council, and two Strathclyde police pipers -- the Glasgow team made
its mark. Glasgow was selected to host the 50th World Congress.
The 4000 delegates who have come to Glasgow represent middle to senior
management from 67 countries. They are future key influencers within
their companies and countries.
The potential for business generation for the city, and for Scotland,
is enormous -- particularly if these delegates go home with a favourable
impression. If nothing else, they will have injected an estimated #5m
into the local economy during the week.
Recognising the importance of such a group, the city in all its forms
has worked wonders to ensure this congress will be a success. The
private sponsors are too numerous to mention but the organising
committee is extremely grateful to them.
Glasgow District Council, Strathclyde Regional Council, the Greater
Glasgow Tourist Board, and Glasgow Development Agency have been
unbelievably supportive.
Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce is proud to have brought the world
congress to the city. The benefits will be there to be reaped for years
to come. We are also proud that the city has recognised these benefits
and worked so hard in our support.
Niall R McClure is chairman of Glasgow Junior Chamber.

JUNIOR Chamber International -- a world-wide federation of young
professionals and entrepreneurs with nearly 400,000 members in more than
123 countries and territories -- is holding its historic 50th World
Congress in Glasgow this week.
Nearly 4000 delegates are attending the seven-day multinational
meeting. Considered among the most important conventions
internationally, the JCI World Congress brings together its world-wide
membership to discuss world issues in a business setting.
JCI president Mr David Oji, from Japan, describes the purpose of the
meeting: ''We gather here to celebrate our congress theme, Success
Through Enterprise, which closely relates to his own presidential theme,
One Step Ahead.
''The primary objective of this year has been to achieve Success
Through Enterprise in all areas of our organisation.''
Junior Chamber International's programmes stem from five areas of
opportunity through which members can acquire or refine leadership
skills and benefit society. These areas include management, individual,
community, international, and business.
Over recent years the emphasis on business development has been
considerable. JCI provides its members with contacts, leadership, and
personal business growth through numerous forums and programmes to
develop themselves as young entrepreneurs and business executives.
Glasgow junior chamber members have seen considerable involvement
within the organisation since winning their bid to host this year's
world Congress. A great deal of organisational and management skills are
required to host an event such as this, with a budget in excess of
#1.3m.
The congress will celebrate junior chambers' past, and the promise of
infinite opportunities for the future.
Benny Ellerbe is secretary general of Junior Chamber International.

HEADING the Junior Chamber International for the past year has meant
that Japanese restaurant owner Mr David Oji has almost lived on an
aeroplane, visiting members of junior chambers around the world and
building business links.
On the eve of the World Congress he was relaxing in Glasgow's Hilton
Hotel before the start of an event that will see 4000 delegates generate
between #5 and #7m for the local economy.
Mr Oji has been a member of the Junior Chamber in Japan for 16 years,
where membership is confined to senior managers. The economics and
business graduate runs a chain of restaurants and a clothing import and
wholesale business.
He was, he said, encouraged to join the junior chamber at the age of
24 by his father, who was also a member.
In the old days, he confessed, business had little to do with the
organisation's activities, but in recent years the emphasis had shifted
to forging links between countries and developing business ideas.
The 40-year-old businessman admitted that the Glasgow event was as
good an opportunity to socialise and head off to the golf course as to
attend training seminars, but delegates who do make their way to the
Concert Hall will be offered 60 hours of daily seminars on ''business
and personal development''.
Glasgow's Jack Black will reveal how, by studying the habits of the
world's most successful people, delegates can take control of their
future. Norwegian expert Bjorn Ringorm promises sessions on ''creative
mind-mapping'' and positive thinking and, for those unable to come to
snap decision, American Kerry Gleeson will present talks on
''over-coming procrastination''.
At the end of the week Mr Oji will hand over his presidency to
American Mr Thomas J Clear III, with a touch of regret but also with the
hope that the 1000 Japanese delegates will take away lasting impressions
of Glasgow which could lead to more overseas investment in Scotland.

ROYAL BOUNTY: THE MAKING OF A WELFARE MONARCHY
Frank Prochaska
Yale University Press, #19.95
THE British monarchy is in trouble. Broadsheet newspapers question its
value while they pick over details of its cost to the taxpayer. The
Queen's presentation of the Windsors as a model family is undermined by
her children's marriage record: of three marriages, one has ended in
divorce and two in separation. Our next king is a self-confessed
adulterer. Private troubles are played out in the full glare of tabloid
publicity.
In the time of the Stewarts none of this would have mattered, but the
gradual and unrelenting shift of political power from the monarch to the
Cabinet has created the need for new justifications for the enormous
wealth and prestige enjoyed by the royal family.
Such a justification was found by George III and elaborated by his
successors. The royal family would become the embodiment of virtue. The
need for a new role was providentially met by a combination of two
social forces. On the one side the decline of the rural community, the
rise of the cities, and the replacement of bonds of social obligation by
the thinner ties of contract were creating ever larger and ever more
public social problems.
On the other side, the successes of industrialisation were challenging
the fatalistic assumption that the tribulations of life were merely to
be tholed. Increasingly obvious need and increasing optimism that the
world could be engineered created philanthropy, and philanthropy gave
the monarchy a new purpose.
As Prochaska says: ''By the late nineteenth century, philanthropy was
not only a sign of individual worth and civic virtue but of national
standing. Indeed, the Victorians equated their civilisation with the
proportion of national activity given over to benevolent causes. Queen
Victoria was patron to about 150 institutions and gave about 20% of her
privy purse income to charity.
Her daughters, constrained by the prevailing opinion against
upper-class women taking paid employment, busied themselves
magnificently in managing schemes for social improvement. Princess
Victoria initiated schools and infirmaries and even designed a new type
of hospital building. Helena laid innumerable foundation stones, visited
countless hospitals, set up a children's holiday home, and founded the
National School for Needlework. She was active in the Ladies Association
for the Care of Friendless Girls and organised the British Nurses'
Association.
Princess Louise earned her mother's disapproval by serving as the
first president for the National Union for Higher Education for Women
and, among hundreds of other causes, championed a Salvation Army home
for unwed mothers in Clapham. She took a keen interest in the Open Space
movement and was responsible for the creation of many public parks.
As well as giving their own time and money, the royals quite
consciously allowed the promoters of good works to use snobbery to
entice money out of those who would part with it in return for an
invitation to a royal dinner or reception or, the ultimate goal for many
a self-interested act of charity, a decoration.
In detailing the development of the monarchy's involvement in good
works, Prochaska is careful to show both the selflessness and
self-interest. Although genuinely and deeply moved by the destitution
they saw on their visits to the slums, the royals were also aware of the
need to justify their privileged position and the class structure of
Britain. As extracts from Prince Albert's diaries show, riots and
revolutions in Europe stimulated the royal family, and other members of
the aristocracy, to find ways both to alleviate the sufferings of the
poor and bind all classes together in a sense of the British as an
extended family.
The start of the twentieth century saw a second change in attitudes to
poverty. The engine which did the social engineering was no longer to be
the vast web of voluntary associations of well-meaning people; now it
was to be the state. Even those involved in charity saw that their tasks
were beyond them and recognised the duplication and inefficiency that
resulted from a lack of central direction. Increasingly people argued
that charity was morally unacceptable. With the rise of the Labour
movement, the language of rights came to the fore.
Despite the creation of the welfare state, voluntarism survived, as
did the monarchy's central role in charity. For the past 16 years,
successive Tory governments have sought to replace dependence on the
''nanny state'' with dependence on independently hired nannies. Even the
Labour Party has accepted that the power and ability of the state is
limited, that there is a place for a civil society distinct from the
state, and that voluntary community activity is essential to the good
life.
Prochaska, an American historian long resident in London, writes in a
formal but light way, the flashes of wit enlivening what could have been
a very dull subject. For example, he writes of Victoria's eldest son:
''Even his adultery had benign effects. Certainly the time he spent with
Frances Maynard, Countess of Warwick, was not all voluptuous immobility.
Whether he enjoyed visiting aged cottagers, signing workhouse visitors'
books, or sponsoring many of her other pet projects, we shall never
know. But to be with her, he did it.''
He politely refrains from asking the obvious question: into what good
works has Camilla Parker-Bowles cajoled the present Prince of Wales? The
quality of research and writing is matched by the quality of production.
Fine gloss paper, 72 illustrations, and not a typographical error in
sight complement Prochaska's style and material in making this book a
delight to read.
Prochaska has produced the very best possible justification for the
monarchy. He concludes: ''Britain's voluntary traditions would survive a
republic, as they have survived religious decline and the ascendant
state. Still, the abolition of the monarchy would destabilise thousands
of existing institutions . . . Where would they turn to steady their
finances and to reassure their supporters and those who depend on their
services -- to the President?'' Since Princess Anne became its
president, the Save the Children Fund's income has gone from #2.5m to
over #50m. Enough said.
But will such good works be enough to restore our monarchy to public
respect and affection? The politeness and reticence of the press used to
be such that the charity work of the royals could be seen as evidence of
their personal virtues and as part of their role as model family,
bridging the chasms of class and uniting the people in common cause.
Ironically, this modern justification of monarchy as virtuous
institution is both a defence and a threat. Because the hereditary
principle offends our modern sense that privileges should be earned by
merit, our attention has been deliberately focused on the personal
virtues of the royal family. Hence we have bizarre discussions about the
fitness of Charles to be king which entirely miss the point that he will
be king because he is the eldest son of the present Queen.
Thanks to our tabloids and to the junior royals' own lack of
reticence, we know that, whatever their civic virtues, our royal family
is as dysfunctional as anything dissected by Oprah Winfrey. Of course,
the monarcy will survive but, despite Prochaska's delightful work, I am
not entirely persuaded that it should.

IF I were in the business of creating soap operas rather than
newspaper columns the raw material from the Gallery of Scottish Art and
Design saga would supply an embarrassment of riches in the plot
department.
For the second time the Post Office Board is now in receipt of bids
for its building in George Square, Glasgow, earmarked as the preferred
site for a new gallery whose purpose is variously to liberate Scotland's
visual arts heritage from the storerooms of the National Galleries of
Scotland, provide another presence for its collections outside of
Edinburgh, and to celebrate Scotland's not inconsiderable contribution
to architecture, design, and photography.
Having agreed the site's suitability with the galleries' trustees, the
Glasgow Development Agency offered the PO #3m for the building. Two
developers came up with more: Morrisons with #3.5m and Jarlaws a million
more than that.
The fact that those first bids entered the public domain so enraged
Jarlaw that it has consulted m'learned friends over the breach of
confidentiality. Meantime, with the goalposts rearranged so that the
second round of bidding would include the promise of a philatelic museum
and a scaling down of any retail options, the three applicants
re-submitted their sealed envelopes. It is popularly supposed that
Morrisons took advantage of the leaked arithmetic to top Jarlaw's bid.
And if the Post Office were only to consider the number of nothings
attached to the offer then a developer rather than a gallery would
undoubtedly win the day.
But, like all soap operas, the scenario is rather more complex, not
even to say downright convoluted.
Although Glasgow needs another new office block right now like John
Major needs an election, any developer will be obliged to go through
stringent planning procedures because of the site's location.
This would make it very difficult to succeed if, as the Jarlaw bid
indicates, there would be major retail outlets within the scheme. The
planning department has long since set its face against that type of
development in the square and, save for the incongruous exception of a
corner bakery, George Square itself is free of shops.
Neither would the fact that either developer might offer part of the
building for a gallery make the bid more attractive to the people who
matter.
Angus Grossart, chair of the National Galleries trustees, made it
crystal clear in his speech to the Royal Glasgow Institute on Friday
night that his board were determined on excellence and not in the market
for being part of any ''haphazard'' development.
And indeed it is difficult to envisage trustees like Lord Macfarlane,
a considerable patron of the visual arts, endorsing a gallery solution
which involved picking your way to the Ramsays, Wilkies, Henrys, and
Peploes via an off-licence and a department store.
Neither could a developer look for assistance in conversion costs to
the Glasgow Development Agency for such a scheme. For one thing the
GDA's bid was predicated, as it has to be, on the price deemed realistic
by the district valuer.
They were told the building was worth no more than #3m and that was
what they bid. And nobody who spent #2m more than that asking price
would be eligible for a handout from the agency's kitty.
And there is another, even more persuasive factor at work. The Gallery
of Scottish Art, provided it is in Glasgow, will have three main funding
pillars. Two are crucial: lottery funding via the National Heritage
Memorial Fund, and investment from the European Regional Development
Fund. Neither would be forthcoming if their money could be construed as
going to the private sector either by means of co-financing a developer
or paying a developer rent for a gallery site within a private building.
So paranoid are the lottery committees after the debacle over the
Churchill papers that all kind of private initiatives hoping to play
lotto, like the company owning Wembley stadium, have been told to run
away and play.
Neither will Glasgow City Council play ball with any developer whose
sub-text is to buy the whole building and sell back part of it to the
city. That is not a runner.
It is worth reflecting too on what chances the PO Board has got of
actually seeing the colour of any developer's money. If either or both
actually have the cash they've offered upfront and are anxious to hand
it over now, well and good.
But that is not how the game is usually played. The offer is normally
hedged around with a cluster of clauses mentioning its being contingent
on planning permission and many other potential wrinkles being ironed
out. Which is why many public buildings and plots of public land were
first offered at grandiose prices for redevelopment and wound up
changing hands for a quid to anyone who would relieve the government
department concerned of the burden of maintenance.
I do not imagine the Post Office would be thrilled at the prospect of
a vandalised white elephant daily overlooked by the City Chambers.
These are sound logistical reasons for selling the building to the
Glasgow Development Agency who, while being unable to raise their bid
for the reasons mentioned, have apparently been able to make a
restructured offer which gives the PO the best guarantee of a reasonably
swift and assured return.
But it is more than a matter of logistics. The wrangling over the
creation of this gallery has gone on more than long enough. It can and
should be an exciting prospect for the millennium of which all Scots and
visitors can be proud. With a Gallery of Modern Art due to open around
the corner next year the area will become revitalised. And, if the final
successful design for the PO block develops the idea of a bold glass
frontage, perhaps incorporating a sculpture garden opening on to a
partially pedestrianised square, then a not especially prepossessing
Victorian pile could be transformed into a magnificent architectural
focus.
Sir Kenneth Graham, chair of the board which will now decide on the
rival bids, has said the Post Office is a public body which must make
its decision in the public good. Ask the public then, Sir Kenneth: do
they want yet another half-empty office block? Do they want the largest
civic square in Scotland to house yet another shopping centre? Or do
they deserve the opportunity to visit a purpose-built home for some of
this country's finest artists, designers, and craftspeople? I would
suggest there's really no contest.

THE fuss over British MPs' secret earnings had an echo in Brussels
last week when Jacques Santer, President of the European Commission,
finally bowed to pressure and ruled that his colleagues must sign a new
code of conduct regulating their nice little earners. As ever in such
matters this decision was presented as further evidence of the European
Commission's determination to obey the EU's guiding principles of
''openness and transparency''. A little scepticism might be forgiven.
Brussels is a curious place when it comes to openness. This is the last
town on earth where you can keep a secret. Yet the European Union --
though more open than Westminster in some ways -- is one of the most
secretive organisations in existence. It took the outspoken Danish
commissioner, Mrs Ritt Bjerregaard, to change the system, albeit
unwittingly. She published a book last month containing refreshingly
unflattering observations of colleagues. The juiciest passages were
enjoyed across Europe before the book was withdrawn. Mr Santer made her
promise to behave better in future and let her keep her job. At the same
time he announced some slight changes to the discredited system which
governs commissioners' conduct.
Commissioners lead pampered lives in Brussels but their opportunity to
make money on the side is restricted. Maastricht prevents them from
engaging in gainful work -- or any other work for that matter -- beyond
their commission duties. There must be no bungs from businessmen or
backhanders from buddies with vested interests, as happens in the
Commons or the European Parliament. Commissioners' interests must be
logged in a register which is open only to the commission president and
the secretary-general. This seems a daft and self-defeating rule which
is why it will probably soon be changed. Under the new code there must
be no payment accepted for articles or speeches. Any fees paid must be
returned or given to charity. In fairness, some commissioners are known
to be punctilious about this already. Neil Kinnock, for example, in his
first week as transport commissioner, received a wonderful model train
which he proudly showed off to reporters. ''My first reportable gift,''
is how he described it, amid jokes about Euro-gravy trains. I hear he
auctioned it for a good cause, although he could have kept it. Mr
Kinnock, like Sir Leon Brittan, gives his fees for speaking to charity
already. From now on commissioners can write books provided they are
vetted by the president. Royalty rules will be ''flexible'', but in
other areas -- such as possible abuse of the commission's limousine
service or travel and hotel expenses -- there are no real changes to
existing practice. At present some commissioners think nothing of
ordering their chauffeurs to drive them hundreds of miles to the ends of
Europe on personal business.
In the European Parliament, secrecy about Euro-MPs' freelance earnings
remains tight. They are permitted to take money from outside interests
but they are not required to state publicly how much. A register of
interests exists for inspection but it is largely meaningless, showing
only sources of remuneration -- and perhaps not all of them. Some
parliamentarians are known to be dissatisfied with this arrangement
which will be up for debate again soon when the whole issue of lobbyists
and consultancies and the financial inducements and rewards they offer
Euro-MPs will be reviewed. Whether it will change much remains to be
seen.
Without question the most secretive of the EU's institutions is the
Council of Ministers which is also the most powerful. Indeed,
scandalously, it is the only major legislative body in the democratic
world which meets in strict secrecy. Remember: this is not ''Brussels''
being awkward -- this is the British Government and others like it whose
ministers then turn round and have the gall to complain about
''European'' deviousness and autocracy. Slowly, the council is losing
the battle to keep its workings private. My colleague, John Carvel from
the Guardian, recently won a landmark victory in the European Court of
Justice -- with no help from the British Government but with backing
from the Danes, Dutch, and others including the Irish -- which forced
the council to surrender documents and voting records. As the verdict
and all its implications loomed, the council relaxed its resistance to
openness despite the humbug about willingly embracing transparency. But
there is still a long way to go before it is an open forum. Much
unexpected good can come from the continued fight to break down
Euro-secrecy. Mrs Bjerregaard might now be unpopular with Danish
politicians and treated warily by her fellow commissioners, but she is a
hero at home. And, would you believe, when the Guardian's case was won,
Carvel actually bought us all strong drink.

CAN our MPs be bought and sold by any others than those entitled to do
so, namely those who elected them to Parliament? That is a raw
proposition, based on the assumption that the most compelling influence
on an MP is not cash but whether or not the MP is elected and
re-elected.
I think it is a fair assumption, if a brutal one. If an MP
consistently defies his electorate's wishes, even if for the most
innocent and honourable of motives, the people who put that MP into the
Commons in the first place can and should dump him. It will cost that MP
about #33,000 in salary (a cash influence, if you like).
This is the ultimate penalty on an MP and it is there to impose by a
jury of ordinary folk who, I submit, make their decisions on grounds of
self-interest and moral considerations. Up to 20 years ago the Commons
was prepared to leave it at that, on the assumption that ''Honourable
Members'' would be guided by their own consciences in regard to their
own conduct as MPs.
Then came the Register of Members' Interests in response to public
disquiet that MPs' consciences were not what they were. It was defied by
Enoch Powell, who had no interests other than great public issues and
his passion for Parliament; in particular, his belief in the Chambers of
Parliament. He said a register would be faulty and he was been proved to
have been right.
Tonight the Commons is to vote on taking things a step further, again
in response to public disquiet about a series of individual cases which
have brought Parliament into further disrepute. There is to be a
beefed-up all-party select committee to handle members' outside
interests and an independent Parliamentary Commissioner to act as a
regulator who, incidentally, is to be paid more than twice an MP's
salary.
The debate tonight follows a lengthy inquiry by the special committee
under Lord Nolan established by the Prime Minister plus a report by the
all-party Commons Select Committee on Standards of Public Life. The
Government wants the House to implement the select committee's
recommendations. Labour says that they don't go far enough.
Everybody is confused by the new proposal that an MP should be
prohibited ''paid advocacy'' but can continue to advise outside
interests. Some of this confusion about what some see as a line drawn in
the sand may be dispelled tonight. The real issue on what is supposed to
be a free vote is this: should an MP be made to declare all earnings,
other than parliamentary pay and allowances?
The Prime Minister and the select committee say ''no''. Such a course
would deny an MP the basic right of every other citizen to earnings
privacy, subject to the Inland Revenue's right to know all. Mr Blair's
Labour Party and others -- including a handful of Tory MPs -- say
''yes''. Full disclosure is the only way to kill the ''sleaze'' factor
so damaging to Parliament's reputation.
This is not about legislation, it is about House of Commons rules,
about which only the Commons can decide on an unwhipped vote or votes.
It is not about the wishes of the Tory right or left (as a glance at the
names of Tories declared for a ''yes'' vote will establish).
It is not supposed to be about ''new'' Labour or ''old'' Labour,
although some ''old'' Labour MPs are deeply concerned that a ban on
''paid advocacy'' will further weaken trade union links. Such MPs, like
Mr Tony Banks, may abstain or vote against the Blair line. Therefore the
decision on full disclosure of earnings could be very close.
There are all sorts of ramifications, but the balance of two
propositions is what it is all about. The Labour line is that all
earnings which accrue from being a member of Parliament, and for no
other reason, should be declared in the public interest.
This has an attraction in so far as we do not vote for a candidate to
go to the Commons to use it as an opportunity to make money on the
expertise that we have allowed that MP to build up. As we pay an MP only
a pittance compared with other nations, we tend to be irritated rather
than surprised that the MP is tempted to make up the money for the job
(long, unsocial hours, etc). In a few cases the sideline money quickly
becomes the mainline money; sceptics claim that it is a rare person who
works harder for those who pay least.
Nolan did not advocate full disclosure of earnings and the select
committee rejected it. Commons leader Tony Newton, who chaired the
select committee, asks the Commons to reject full disclosure tonight. He
will base his case on the select committee finding which was as follows:
''In reality we judge that the real choice is between the view that
compulsory disclosure of remuneration for legitimate activity is an
unjustified intrusion, and the view that full disclosure of all income
-- in effect, the publication of the tax return -- should be required.
Nolan concluded that 'no-one has put a convincing case' for full
disclosure. We agree.''
Mr Major is accused by Mr Blair of reneging on his promise to
implement Nolan. His implication is that the Prime Minister has bowed to
pressure from his right-wing, gravy-train back benchers. ''Once more,
they have put party interest before national interest,'' he said. If
anyone is to get any kudos for ending or curtailing the ''sleaze''
factor, Mr Blair wants to ensure it is he. So much is party politics.
The counter argument is that it is not sleazy for MPs to indulge in
outside interests like the trade unions, the law, or journalism,
particularly if they are trade unionists, lawyers, or journalists.
OBVIOUSLY, experience as an MP should enhance abilities in such areas.
The same ought to go for other professions and trades like property,
business, leather-working, fishing, and, yes, even City wheeling and
dealing.
If these ''outside'' activities are discouraged, we may end up by
electing only careerist politicians. Those who transgress the bounds of
propriety and honour should not be merely deselected by their local
party organisations, or merely suspended as MPs for a time. They should
be thrown out of the House of Commons, pronto. They should sign a
contract to that effect before they are allowed to take the Oath of
Allegiance.

Former Olympic finalists ready to commence battle
IT WAS just like old times under the Nevada Desert stars. First,
another memorable ring war was waged between Riddick Bowe and Evander
Holyfield at Caesars Palace. Then came one of boxing's time-honoured war
or words between Bowe and Britain's Lennox Lewis after a courageous but
exhausted Holyfield had been halted in the eighth round of a fight to
compare with the ferocity and excitement of the '92 and '93 epics.
The paths of Bowe and Lewis have not seriously crossed for three
years; they have had enough respective title success to go their
separate ways. Before then, though, there had been plenty of bad feeling
to go round.
But the 1988 Seoul Olympic final rivals once more need each other
badly as neither protagonist appears to have a serious hope at present
of challenging for one of the three main titles, the World Boxing
Council, World Boxing Assocation, and International Boxing Federation.
Bowe versus Lewis is now the big ''natural'' for American pay-per-view
TV consumption and Home Box Office chief Seth Abraham is working doubly
hard to make it happen.
Meetings have gone on behind the scenes for the past two weeks, and
Abraham is targeting a match for April for the overdue collision of his
dream duo in Las Vegas. And it all looks to be going in the right
direction.
Lewis turned up at Bowe's post-fight news conference -- and Bowe
boomed at him: ''You want to cut some of those dreadlocks out of your
hair. After the first of the year, you're going to be the first one I
knock out in 1996.'' The former WBC champion countered:
''Congratulations on winning the fight. The question I want answered is:
'when are you going to fight me?' There are no more belts to throw away.
It just proves how scared you are. You're still ''chicken'' Bowe to me.'
''
Holyfield was ahead by a point on all three cards, but almost out on
his feet with exhaustion when Bowe caught him with a thumping right
which put the former undisputed world champion face down on the canvas.
He rose at nine and, questionably, referee Joe Cortez allowed him to
continue, only to be battered down again -- and the pulsating third
clash was halted after 58 seconds of the eighth round.
Meanwhile, Bowe's manager Rock Newman last night threw Mike Tyson's
name into his list of priority opponents.
Newman said he has been in touch with Tyson's promotor Don King since
the victory over Holyfield.
But Lewis should not over worry about the possibility of another big
fight slipping out of his grasp, having already lost out by an immediate
rematch with WBC champion Frank Bruno.
The interpretation of Newman's morning-after-the-night-before address
to the media was that he was giving Lewis the message not to be
over-demanding on terms for a fight with Bowe.
After all, Tyson is not yet ready for a Bowe fight. Not only has he
still to recover from a cracked thumb, but his diary his already full
for the forthcoming bout against Buster Mathis Jr -- postponed from last
night -- and his title date with Bruno is firm for March 16 in Las
Vegas.
The key man in the whole scenario is Abraham, the man responsible for
putting up the cash for the major fight -- and Bowe-Lewis is his No.1
priority.
Abraham said: ''It's going to happen, we have already started talks.
It's only a question of terms. I shall bring my cheque book to the next
meeting.''
Bowe-Lewis has been simmering ever since the two men clashed in
super-heavyweight final in Seoul, which Lewis won to take the gold
medal.
Other attempts to get the two men together have foundered, but it now
looks the best chance of bringing Bowe and Lewis together in arguably
one the most appealing heavyweight match-ups waiting to happen.
Abraham has pinpointed March or April for the fight -- and Newman
agrees that Bowe will be back in the ring in that period.
Newman said: ''I believe if you don't make an attempt to make Tyson,
Tyson won't be made. I think that a secondary fight to that will be
Lennox Lewis, the second most intriguing fight right now.
''But that is if we can reach reasonable terms. We will want to get it
together quickly, we do not want a lot of monkeying about.
''I talked to Lewis' promoter, Panos Eliades, about three weeks ago,
but at the time they were waiting to see what's going to happen with
their WBC situation.
''Riddick is briming with confidence about a Lewis fight. We think
that he will destroy Lewis.''
Lewis countered: ''I want to fight the best heavyweights in the world,
but I still want my belt back.
''The whole world's been waiting for a Lewis-Bowe fight -- and I've
been waiting for that since the beginning. It's going to be a great
fight and it will capture the world's attention.

Dominican Republic, in the fourth round to retain the WBF junior
bantamweight championship in Bangkok.
It was Samson's seventh defence of the title he won in 1994.

lightweight title against American challenger Raymondo 'Rocky' Martinez

Everton 1, Blackburn 0
GRAHAM Stuart yesterday earned Everton their first Premiership win
since August as Blackburn's away day blues continued.
The former Chelsea man popped up midway through the first half of a
dreadful advert for the English game to drill home his fourth goal of
the season after Andrei Kanchelskis had opened the way to goal.
Only a superb display of goalkeeping from Tim Flowers spared Rovers a
real mauling. Defeat meant that Ray Harford's men have picked up just
one point from their six away league games this term and have gone seven
months since winning on their Premiership travels.
After another abject display -- Neville Southall did not have a save
to make -- that can only increase the pressure on the Ewood manager it
seems hard to imagine they will break their winning duck in the near
future.
The Stuart goal was what the game needed, after it had begun in a
style that lived down to all the worst pre-match expectations.
Passes were misplaced with soul-destroying consistency, and the
damning fact the the holders of the two major domestic trophies were on
display only served to magnify the paucity of quality.
''We were very poor in the first half and, even though we livened up a
bit in the second, we didn't create any chances,'' said Blackburn
manager Harford.
A trip to St James' Park on Wednesday would be a worry in any
circumstances at present but, with Rovers a pale shadow of the side that
swept to the title last term, the timing could not have been worse.
Striker Alan Shearer awoke yesterday to newspaper stories indicating
he was bound for St James' Park and, although Harford refused to
comment, Shearer did say: ''One of the lads told me about the story, but
I've heard nothing about Newcastle's interest.
''They are a huge club, though, and I've said before that I'd love to
play for them at some stage in my career, but I've got a contract with
Blackburn.''
* DIEGO Simeone's goal in the second half maintained Atletico Madrid's
lead in the Spanish first division after a hard fought 1-0 victory at
Real Zaragoza.
Atletico came close to conceding their first away goal of the season
in the first half but took control after the break.

CONSIDERING the week that has just passed, the national manager might
be tempted to pick 10 defenders to keep the score down against San
Marino in Scotland's final European Championship qualifier at Hampden in
10 days' time, but Craig Brown will take a more positive approach when
he announces his squad this afternoon.
There will be no real surprises in the line-up, although Scot Gemmill,
the Nottingham Forest midfield player, looks likely to get his chance to
supplement his three caps to date.
It may be the ones left out who will make more news in that Rangers'
keeper Andy Goram, recovering from a hip injury, is unlikely to be
included. It could be also that Aberdeen's Duncan Shearer, who has not
been a regular starter for his club, will miss out this time while Brown
may settle for fewer defenders than usual and Motherwell's Brian Martin
may be omitted.
There will be no call-up for Nottingham Forest keeper Mark Crossley
despite suggestions that he has a Scottish grandmother. Until he
receives proof of that from the player and an indication that he wishes
to wear a Scotland shirt, Brown will ignore his claims.
* JAILED Everton striker Duncan Ferguson's appeal against a 12-match
SFA suspension is to be considered this week.
The independent Appeals Tribunal, set up by the SFA, is to meet to
consider the ban imposed after the Rangers player's head-butt on John
McStay of Raith Rovers in April 1994.
The Scotland striker is currently serving a three-month jail sentence
for the same incident.
He has served one game of the 12-match ban but the Football
Association are waiting for the verdict from their counterparts north of
the Border before taking action.
* MIDDLESBROUGH will almost certainly be without Juninho for six weeks
early next year.
Brazil are insisting on his release for the under-23 squad which will
play in the Olympic qualifying tournament being held in Argentina next
February and March.
It means he could miss about eight games when Middlesbrough may
conceivably be chasing a place in Europe.
Brazil have already claimed Juninho on Wednesday for the friendly in
Argentina, which means he will miss the Coca-Cola Cup replay with
Crystal Palace the same night.

WORLD OPEN
EUROPEAN Tour campaigner Frank Nobilo broke out of the pack late in
the final round to pass faltering Miguel Angel Jimenez and win the $1.9m
Sarazen World Open over the Chateau Elan course, near Atlanta,
yesterday.
Nobilo was three behind with five holes left, but he reeled off three
successive birdies starting at the fourteenth, and even a three-putt
bogey at the final hole did not matter in the end.
The London-based Kiwi shot a closing four-under-par 68 in near
freezing conditions and made his winning putt in light hail. He finished
at eight-under 208 in the rain-shortened tournament, one better than
Spaniard Jimenez (73) and Zimbabwean Mark McNulty (67).
Nobilo, 35, collected $350,000, the biggest cheque of his career, for
his second victory of the year. He previously won the BMW International
Open in Munich in July, and finished No.20 on the European Order of
Merit.
Scot Sam Torrance began the final round level with Nobilo yesterday,
but was never in the hunt as he struggled to a two-over-par 74 to fade
to equal fifteenth. Torrance said later he would play for Scotland in
the World Cup starting in China on Thursday, but planned to pull out of
the Pro-Am due to a leg injury.
Torrance, who will team up with Andrew Coltart, has a nagging pain
just below his left groin and the problem has been getting worse in
recent weeks.
Nobilo teed off four behind Jimenez, and did not loom large until he
birdied the par-5 fourteenth.
Further birdies at the next two holes gave Nobilo the outright lead,
and when he saved par from nine feet at the seventeenth the tournament
was his to lose. Lost it Nobilo nearly did, after missing a three-foot
par putt at the final green, which left him with a four-footer for
bogey. ''There's no question I was pretty nervous on the second putt,''
Nobilo admitted.
His victory capped off a great weekend for New Zealand golf, following
compatriot Michael Campbell's win in the Alfred Dunhill Masters in
Indonesia. The pair will team up to play the World Cup starting in China
on Thursday.
Final scores (US unless stated):
208 -- Frank Nobilo (New Zealand) 70, 70, 68.
209 -- Mark McNulty (Zimbabwe) 72, 70, 67; Miguel Angel Jimenez
(Spain) 67, 69, 73.
210 -- Mark Calcavechia 71, 70, 69; Anders Forsbrand (Sweden) 69, 72,
69; Eduardo Romero (Argentina) 69, 71, 70; Emlyn Aubrey 70, 70, 70.
211 -- John Daly 70, 68, 73; Craig Stadler 68, 70, 73.
212 -- Retief Goosen (S Africa) 70, 72, 70; Lucas Parsons (Australia)
70, 72, 70; Ernie Els (S Africa) 71, 70, 71.
Others included: 214 -- Sam Torrance (Scotland) 71, 69, 74. 216 --
Andrew Oldcorn (England) 71, 75, 70. 220 -- Philip Walton (Ireland) 70,
72, 78.
* RAYMOND Floyd made a six-foot birdie putt on the second play-off
hole to beat Tom Wargo and win the inaugural #650,000 Emerald Coast
Classic on the US Senior PGA Tour in Milton, Florida last night. Floyd
shot a five-under 66 while Wargo charged in with 64, tying both players
on seven under for the event.

I know what is required and I am prepared to do everything necessary
to become as good a tennis player as I possibly can. Where that will
leave me, I am not quite certain
I was pointed towards tennis when I was a child, about five, I think,
because my dad wanted me to take part in an individual sport. In tennis
you don't have to rely on anyone else
ALAN Mackin the sequel promises to be worth watching.
Forget the orginal, the former rugged defender of Queen's Park,
Motherwell, Falkirk, and Partick Thistle. The early indications suggest
Mackin Mk 2 has a future in a world far removed from the smell of
liniment, the seething passion of the terracings, and the clatter of
stud on bone.
Alan Mackin junior has chosen tennis as his sport and is edging
towards his ultimate goal -- a place in the world's top 100 -- with a
strength of desire and an intelligence which belies his age. His visiom
never wavers when he says: ''I was pointed towards tennis when I was a
child, about five, I think, because my dad wanted me to take part in an
individual sport.
''You know, one in which there would not be so many let downs and
disappointments because of other team members. In tennis you don't have
to rely on anyone else.
''In a team sport you could be a good player, but if you don't get on
with team-mates or team managers for whatever reasons then you don't get
selected. In my sport, if it doesn't happen then you have only yourself
to blame. It is that individual aspect which appeals to me a lot.''
It was a reasoned delivery you would expect to hear from any of the
seasoned pros who take over the lawns of the All England Lawn Tennis
Club during the Wimbledon fortnight. It was an articulate reply, but the
difference is Mackin, who has just been selected to play in a
blue-riband tournament, the 1995 Junior Orange Bowl in Florida next
month, has just turned 14.
Already, though, his mentality and standard of play are developing
apace and the strength of body he will also require will come through
carefully planned exercise, not that Mackin is particularly perturbed by
his shape.
''I am happy to work on technique and skills at the moment because
there would be no point in developing a physique first only to find the
necessary shots were missing,'' he said.
It is here the Paisley youngster, who has only recently returned from
10 months intensive coaching with Mateo Palmer at the Majorca Tennis
Club in Spain, is reminiscent of a football person, probably inevitable
given his father's background. The older Mackin, who remains the major
shareholder in East Stirling although he doesn't go about the club, has
studied footballers and believes in the need to progress slowly with
embryo sporting stars.
Mackin senior was quick to realise the insanity inherent in
traditional football ways and will not allow his son to be abused in the
world of tennis. ''No one asks more than Alan can give and he knows
developing skill first is the key to anything he may achieve in his
future,'' Mackin said.
His son became the youngest ever boy to receive a full Rover
scholarship and was selected personally by the former British No.1 and
Davis Cup player, Mark Cox, who is now director of the Lawn Tennis
Association's Rover Junior Tennis Initiative.
This would be the equivalent of a young footballer being chosen for
specialist training by the SFA after having been identified as someone
with a good chance of succeeding, but there is no trace of an ego with
Mackin. There are very few signs of his early successes positioned
around his home even though he has reached some highs which deserve
mention.
From having become the youngest men's champion at his club,
Whitecraigs, when he was only 13, he helped Britain to the European
under-14 Championship (the Copa Del Sol) in July of this year. He faced
a test of skill and temperament when Britain were tied 2-2 with Italy in
a quarter-final match and tensions were running high, but Mackin, who
was the Scottish under-14 champion when he was only 11, kept calm and
won the match 6-4, 6-4.
That triumph carried Britain into the semis and also a place in the
World Team Championships in Japan, and Mackin's coach Simon Jones
believes he has the makings of an Association of Tournament
Professionals (ATP) player. Jones works with him one week a month at
Bath University where two days of each of those weeks, the young tennis
player works out with English rugby internationalists Victor Ubogu and
Jeremy Guscott. The chances are Mackin will move south fulltime next
year.
When he isn't at Bath or playing in tournaments, he attends Glasgow
Academy, who have been extremely understanding in accommodating his
training habits. On Mondays he is at school, but he rises at 6.30am on
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays to be at Stirling University's Gannochy
Tennis Centre by 8am. He goes back to school in the afternoons.
He trains at Scotstoun in the evenings while on Wednesday he reverses
his routine, with school in the morning, coaching at Stirling in the
afternoon, and study time in the evenings. It is a regime which puts
professional footballers to shame.
Of course, Mackin was fortunate in that his dad, who has property
interests, could afford to send him to Spain, but the youngster is
wealthy in a much more profound sense. He harbours a fierce desire to
succeed.
The riches to be gained in tennis are enoromous, but that is also why
it is so difficult to rise through the all-important rankings.
Sacrifices must be made, although Mackin said: ''I am not exactly
without friends, although a lot of them are on the coaching courses, but
I hope that working now will benefit me in the future.
''I know what is required and I am prepared to do everything necessary
to become as good a tennis player as I possibly can. Where that will
leave me, I am not quite certain, but so far I am up to scratch with
schoolwork and also my tennis, although I need a better forehand and a
bigger serve.''
Mackin was never interrupted once by his father, which went against
the perception that tennis parents are all dangerously demanding and
hard on their children. Many are, in fact, but Mackin snr has witnessed
too many football careers destroyed because of the unreasonable
expectations of parents.
''I talk to him a lot when we are alone,'' said Mackin snr. ''Usually
it is to encourage him and to stress that every time he steps on to a
court it should be to enjoy himself. Without enjoyment he won't fulfil
his potential.
''After what he has already put into developing his game, it would be
a shame if he were to walk away from his sport at some point in his
life. That would be the one thing which would annoy me because, even if
doesn't become good enough to earn a living, I would still want him to
play and enjoy playing.
''There were times in my own career when I went on to a pitch with a
fear of failing and that kind of emotion is counter-productive. I don't
ever want Alan to feel that way.''
Somehow Master Mackin looks as though he has the balance almost
perfect, but he knows, too, there are no guarantees. ''So far I have no
regrets and I hope that will always be the case. I am well aware of how
difficult it will be to reach the level I want, but I'm willing to try
my best. I can do no more than that.''

AT FIRST there were 10, but by the end of last week there was only
one.
British teams had an ignominious journey into Europe. Other than
Nottingham Forest, the others were swept aside by bigger, better teams.
Raith Rovers made a gallant effort before bowing out on Tuesday,
Rangers were comprevensively beaten by Juventus on Wednesday, and then
Celtic were thrashed by a team who strolled to victory on Thursday. Not
a good week for Scottish football.
And the defeats were all the more depressing because there was no
sense of the ''we nearly'' or ''if only'' about the fans as they trudged
home from Ibrox and Parkhead.
These big European clubs have abilities well beyond the expectations
of Scottish club players. As well as their skills, the sheer strength
and fitness of players like Ravanelli and Djorkaeff are at the other end
of spectrum from the workmanlike Scots.
As one fan said at Parkhead: ''Our best players aren't as good their
worst ones.''
In Europe, Raith Rovers were the only team to score and that by an own
goal.
But on Saturday there were goals galore, cheers from the sidelines,
and smiles all round when the future of Scottish football was on show.
Walker Crisps, as well as managing the almost impossible task of
portraying Gary Lineker as a fiend, sponsor a Scottish primary school
soccer sevens competition.
And on Saturday more than 60 boys played their hearts out in Wishaw,
in the first round of the national tournament. They came from primary
schools all over the Motherwell/Wishaw area.
Three teams would make it through to the Lanarkshire final and from
there to the Strathclyde decider before, hopefully, progressing to a
final played at a senior ground later in the year.
Instead of the angst and ''win at all costs'' games, played at many
boys clubs, soccer sevens is about encouraging skills, free-flowing
play, and teaching chidren to appreciate the game. It's not about
parents bawling and shouting on the sidelines in a bid for petty
reflected glory. The bad old habits are discouraged.
Janitors, teachers, parents, and dedicated local people brought teams
eager to show off the skills they had learned and the children loved
their morning.
The spirit of the day was summed up by the area organiser, Alan
Borthwick.
''I think it's been worthwhile when they come off the park and they
are still smiling. Sure, there may be an initial 'oh no, we lost' but
then you see their expressions change and the pleasure in having played
takes over.''
Craig was typical. A 10-year-old, his team failed to make it through
but his love of football was undiminished and contrary to popular
belief, old-fashioned street games are not a thing of the past. He
gleefully told of an 18-5 victory over a neighbouring team the previous
week.
Jock Stein once said: ''Soccer sevens with its emphasis on basic
skills, total commitment, and imaginative movement could strongly
influence the international status of Scotland in the future.''
But if that is to happen more changes need to take place. For the
children to make more of their opportunity, senior players should have a
bigger role to play. Ask any of those schoolboys who their hero is, and
they will have an instant answer.
And so local clubs should have an obligation to spend more time with
the aspiring youngsters in the area. Encourage them to train at local
senior grounds and learn techniques from their equivalent there.
Mind you, many senior Scots have a lot to learn themselves on that
score. Perhaps players should be obliged to return for afternoon
sessions to concentrate on their skills. After all the attitude of many
Scots is diametrically opposed to that to Cantona and Berkamp. These
players, who need the least work on ball control and skill, are usually
the last to leave the training ground.
Isn't it time for football to follow the example of rugby by sending
teams of development officers into the schools?
For young players to have a better chance when they reach senior
level, the structure of the premier division has to change so that the
paranoia of the teams further down the division is assuaged. These young
players can never flourish in such a pressurised atmosphere.
Who knows, one of the boys playing on Saturday could be a hero of
tomorrow. But he'll only be a hero on the European stage if attitudes
change and radical measures are taken.

THIS being a diary, let us start with a common denominator of dates.
April 6, 1963; April 15, 1967; June 4, 1977; May 23, 1981. Answers on a
postcard please!
These were the four occasions in my lifetime when I was able to rise
to my feet at the end of a football match in Scotland's other national
stadium and permit myself the thinnest of smiles that a little sporting
pageant had ended with a satisfactory outcome for our small nation.
I can labour with this fiction no longer. It was the four times we
gubbed Ingland at Wemberley .
It is quite in keeping with the general crassness of our nearest and
dearest neighbours that they last week made the decision whether they
should place a new national stadium either at Wemberley or in Manchester
without any consultation whatsoever with either the Scottish Office of
the members of the Peterhead Loyal Branch of Craig Brown's Blue and
White Tartan Army.
Wemberley is as much ours as theirs. Never once in the 11 times I
watched Scotland play on that ground was the remotest possibility that
our fans were outnumbered by their English counterparts. In 1977 (2-0,
McQueen and Dalglish) it was conservatively estimated that 75,000 of the
100,000 crowd were our own. Which was quite handful to get on to the
pitch at the finish.
So Scotland votes unanimously for Wemberley because Manchester is such
a hopeless city. Not only does it have no fountains in Trafalgar Square,
so necessary to accommodate the Scottish love of swimming, it is also
almost 200 miles away from Soho.
To make matters worse, Mancunians are a decent crowd who brew
Boddington's, eat pies, know their football, and with whom it is quite
possible to have a decently brotherly conversation.
This is not at all what we want. It has to be Wemberley, for that is
the ancient shrine for men behaving badly.
I realised the gig was over in 1983 when, on the opposite platform of
Blackfriars tube station four Scots greeted the arrival of every train
by turning their backs to it, bending down, and raising their kilts
above their buttons. Maiden aunts on their way to Claridges for tea
fainted. Mothers averted their infants' gaze, but Japanese tourists
snapped avidly with their cameras at the ritual.
Just about every Scot who ever went on a Wemberley weekend behaved
badly, though. I remember one occasion when the warmth of London's
hospitality was revealed by its decision to withdraw all underground
services. A cabbie offered to take us from Raymond's Revue bar, where we
had been watching a special Saturday morning show, to Wemberley for
#4.50 -- a colossal sum.
Arriving at Wemberley, he demanded the money. The late John
Fairgreave, a prince among sportswriters, announced that the cab had
been ''appropriated'' by members of the Central Committee of the
Democratic Scottish Socialist Republic here on a fact-finding mission
and no fare would be paid.
Fellow-travellers kept the cabbie at bay while we made our escape.
Managers could behave badly, too. The late Willie Ormond arrived back
at the St Ermin's Hotel after a mere moral victory to be bought a
consoling drink by a teetotal sportwriters (yes, honestly). Willie was
not averse to what he described as ''a wee wet'' but never drank whisky,
which was on offer.
It was all too much for his system. He fled the foyer bar and was
violently sick in the forecourt in front of several hundred supporters
gathered there.
''Good on ye, wee man,'' they cried appreciatively.
The occasion even got the better of the normally unflappable Jock
Stein (1981, 1-0, Robertson pen.)
The Big Man was making his way across the tarmac at Luton Airport to
board an ancient Viscount which was bringing us home. ''I thought you
were a wee bit lucky today, Jock,'' opined a passing baggage handler.
What followed was the finest two minutes of pure invective that it has
been my privilege to enjoy.
Stein, in passing, made repeated reference to the sexual proclivities
of the entire English nation, its manner of speech, its chequered
colonial past, its somewhat contemptuous attitude to every other country
in the world, and climaxed this magnificent peroration with the
unkindest cut of all.
''And, by the way, the ball never went over the line for that third
goal in the 1966 World Cup final!''
He beamed happily to me and said how much he was looking forward to a
nice cup of tea with Jean in a couple of hours time.
If they English do decide to decamp to Manchester, I would make this
offer to a beleaguered Wemberley PLC: We'll rent the place and play all
Scotland's home matches there. And, honest, guv, we promise to leave the
pitch behind.

Brown warming to the Laudrup solution.
SCOTLAND could be ready to adopt a new approach to their World Cup
qualifying games which would ease the problems over the release of
players for international games.
That problem has been highlighted by Danish star Michael Laudrup,
brother of the injured Rangers' forward Michael, who has suffered so
badly over the club v country conflicts which constantly surround the
crowded fixture lists in every country in these modern times.
Laudrup felt so badly about these worries and his own situation that
he wrote a letter to the European Union spelling out his solution.
And that solution is one which will gain support from the Scotland
manager Craig Brown as he soon begins his preparations for the World Cup
qualifying games.
It may seem early to ask Brown to look towards qualification for the
World Cup Finals in France in l998 but the draw will be made in Paris
next month and already it has been suggsted to the competing countries
that they can kick off their qualifying games in the Spring.
That would not be an attractive proposition to Brown, who will be
taking his team to the European Championship Finals in England next
summer, but the Laudrup idea does find favour.
Basically the Real Madrid striker suggests that, in a bid to avoid
fixture clashes, internationals should, perhaps, be played on a
back-to-back basis.
Brown agrees. He recognises that the fewer demands he places on clubs
will be to his advantage.
In his letter to UEFA, Laudrup says: ''As soon as I saw the fixture
list for this season, I felt that familiar sinking feeling in my
stomach. Real Madrid away to Atletico Bilbao (later it was changed to
Rayo Vallacano) for the opening fixture on September 3 -- and on the
same afternoon I would have to report for training with the Danish
national team.
''Dozens of other footballers all over Europe were in the same
position.
''The basic problems were the usual ones. Spain didn't feel that the
home game against Cyprus required a whole week's preparation and decided
not to leave a blank week-end before it. It happens all the time. So:
new season, same old problems.
''That's why I'd like to see more experiments with the formula used by
Italy, Croatia, Ukraine, and Estonia in Group 4 earlier this year. You
don't play the qualifying phase one match at a time -- you play the
matches in pairs, one at the week-end and another one the following
Wednesday.
''Instead of having conflicts on ten week-ends, national teams can
complete their fixtures by getting together five times without
conflicts.
''You play normal domestic leaugue programmes on one week-end. On
Monday, the players report to their national team coaches, who then have
the squad together for ten days instead of three or four. The national
team plays one fixture on the Saturday or Sunday and another one on the
Wednesday. Players report back to their clubs the following day and
domestic championships resume after one one 'blank' week-end.''
It is a concept which appeals to Brown, who knows that the fixture
burden will again afflict him when the World Cup qualifying draw is made
at the Louvre.
The European bosses have suggested to FIFA that there should be six
groups of five teams and three groups of six teams in the qualifying
period.The top team in each group would qualify automatically along with
the best second-placed country. There would then be play-offs from the
other eight runners-up to finalise the 14 Final places Europe has been
allowed.
As always, it will be a nightmare for international managers
attempting to find a way through the domestic programme.
Craig Brown admits that the Laudrup idea -- which was also discussed
by UEFA delegates -- would help him.
He points out: ''During this current European campaign, I have had
tremendous assistance from the Scottish League in regard to the
postponement of the League programmes. I appreciate what they have done
but this idea would make my demands less and it would be of definite
benefit to the national side.
''We have been advocating for some time using week-end dates for
international games and I reckon that taking it all this stage further
would be even better for us. We won't know the demands until the draw is
made in Paris next month but we always know that we will have problems.
This is one way of alleviating these.''
There is, of course, another aspcet of the Laudrup suggestion which
appeals to Brown. The Real Madrid player stresses: ''This will allow
players and coaches to spend more time together at national level which
could, in theory at least, give us a chance of playing better, more
co--ordinated football.''
Brown admits: ''It would be wonderful to have the players together for
an extended spell and I will be looking at this and taking it up with
the Association before we get down to sorting our the qualifying dates.
It would be of enormous advantage to us.''
It would also, as Laudrup says in his summing-up, ''eliminate the
club-versus-country conflicts which have become a nightmare for so many
players.''

CALL me old-fashioned, but when I turn to The Herald Sport section on
a Monday morning to read the football match reports, I honestly expect
to see match reports, containing some informed comments and a reasoned
analysis of each team's skills, tactics, and overall performance on the
day.
However, on reading some recent reports -- for example, Rangers v
Partick Thistle, last week's Aberdeen v Partick Thistle by Ian Paul and
today's Partick Thistle v Motherwell by Douglas Campbell (you may deduce
I am a Jags fan) -- I was unable to tell whether these correspondents
had actually witnessed the game or had simply spoken to someone who knew
someone else connected with the clubs.
For a newspaper which claims to have a serious commitment to Scottish
sports journalism, why have you printed entire articles about the
contract machinations of Aberdeen's Paul Bernard and Partick Thistle's
Ian Cameron under the guise of match reports?
Like many of your readers, I am not always able to attend the fixture
of my choice, so a bit more critical comment and a little less
irrelevant verbiage would be welcomed.

HAVING read James Traynor's article, ''Real Men of Infamy'', and
Queen's Park director Martin Smith's letter (Sports Herald, October 30),
maybe James should engage his brain before operating his mouth.
Quite how he justifies his nostalgic reminiscences about the hard men
of football is a mystery to me. At a time when the finer points of the
game are under-developed and quality players at a premium, his comments
are at best ill-advised and at worst offensive. In particular were the
references to Gregor Stevens and Gary Lineker. Stevens was an
embarrassment to most Rangers supporters, myself included. As far as
Lineker being a 'Mummy's Boy,' well, that's a bit pathetic. Here we have
a player who epitomises all that is good about the game, but one gets
the impression that James would rather watch guys whose sole aim is to
stop such players by any means, fair or foul. A random survey would
prove that the majority would rather watch the more gifted player. Of
course, all teams need a bit of steel, but not at the expense of players
being intimidated.
Some of the players he mentioned were fair eough. However, he omitted
a few obvious names who were hard but fair and had a bit of class too.
e.g. Tom Forsyth, Terry Butcher, Danny McGrain, Alex McLeish. They
exuded a ''thou shalt not pass'' authority without opponents expecting a
trip to the local infirmary.
I suspect that James' comments on the hard men were possibly meant to
be tongue in cheek, but given the lack of class players, particularly in
Scotland, would he not be better to ask where is the next Henderson,
Cooper, Johnstone or Dalglish coming from? Perhaps such attempts at
humour are best left to those journalists (of sorts) who excel at that
sort of stuff. You know the ones I mean -- the ''in your face'' brigade.
As for the comments on the Hampden pitch, I only wish I could blame it
for the curtailment of Rangers' interest in this season's League Cup
instead of their own inept performance. The truth is that, for all
Hampden Park's faults, and there are many, the playing surface is beyond
reproach. The excellent condition of the pitch is all the more
remarkable considering the extra demands made of it last season due to
''unexpected guests.'' Anyone who cannot play on such a fine surface,
albeit slightly moist, surely can't be called a footballer.
The ground staff are to be congratulated.

I HAVE followed football in general, and Rangers in particular, since
my school days in the 40s. Though it is fine to see the mighty humbled
from time to time, it is with great regret that I observe their
horrendous injury list. Even allowing for their vast pool of players,
things seem to be getting out of hand. Presumably modern medical
techniques should have helped in some way to alleviate the situation. It
must be upsetting for the fans to come out to watch a team which is more
or less unrecognisable from week to week.
I cannot imagine having seen a side without Young and Woodburn,
McColl, Cox, plus Thornton all absent at once. Hibs' famous five,
Hearts' famous inside trio, and the Firhill flier (McKenzie) were nearly
always on show. I only recall one Rangers substitute -- Willie Rae --
who appeared at that time (selection usually booed).
What can be done? The season and fixture list is far too long and it
is ridiculous to arrive at the start of a new season with players still
not recovered from injuries sustained in the previous season.
Finally, could we not revert to the old system of two full backs,
three half backs, and a forward line with two orthodox wingers? Then we
could understand what it is all about.

I AM sure that I am not alone in being angered by the recent attempt
by motor racing officials to ban the St Andrews Cross from the side of
Whitburn's Mario Francitti's car.
The problem arises not from any anti-Scottish sentiment by the world's
sporting officials but from an understandable confusion as to the status
of Scotland.
In some sports, such as football and rugby, Scotland is given
international recognition while in others we are regarded as a region.
The resolution of this problem will only be resolved when Scotland
regains her independence. Then all of Scotland's sportsmen and women
will be able to compete at international level.

I WAS fascinated to read Peter Haining's article (Arena, Ovtober 27)
and to learn of his visionary proposals for a Scottish Indoor Water
Sports Academy of Excellence.
Many will dismiss his ideas out of hand, given the sheer scale and
audacity of the proposed project. Before we too readily cast aside the
superb benefits which such a facility would provide, those at the
forefront of sport and business in Scotland could perhaps use your
columns to explore the idea further.
It may be that the inclusion of other sports, such as football and
rugby, alongside the suggested commercial activities, would improve the
economic viability of a project which would propel Scottish sport into a
world lead.

PERHAPS one of the most famous pictures ever was in the old Picture
Post, and used thousands of times since. It was of two prancing
cowgirls, caught in mid-air, all Pepsident smiles and Toni perms, and
short skirts swirling the two girls had legs which were athletic,
elegant, cute, and as all-American and innocent as Mom's apple pie.
Innocent is the word here for that was part of the sexiness of the
snap. It wasn't sleazy. In fact, the girls were the picture of health.
So was the picture and even as a little lad I fell in love with
cheerleaders.
So there I was at the weekend sent off to an assignment close to my
heart and aesthetics. The Scottish Claymores cheerleaders' trials in
Edinburgh and Glasgow's Marco's Leisure Centres.
Why cheerleaders haven't been a staple entertainment for, say soccer
matches, in Britain is a mystery really. No, it's not. Soccer isn't
about entertainment and never has been. (These days not even on the
field). It has been about battle and war and unremitting rivalry and
hostility. And male. From the days of the flat caps to the modern world
of corporate footy for software firms, it is virtually exclusively male,
maybe the odd dolly bird or two.
It is most certainly not the family day out which is what the world of
American sport is all about. And American football, like baseball, is
really a day out for weans, wives, girlfriends, dads, and grandpapas. A
full day at that.
The Scottish Claymores are attempting to take root in Scotland, at
Murrayfield Stadium, and part of the process to introduce American
football to Europe is to promote. There is a party before every American
match, with beer tents and hamburger barbecues and it is a carnival
altogether. While in soccer you are not permitted within a mile of a
football stadium with a can of low alcohol lager in your mitt, there is
a bloody beer tent just behind Murrayfield. I am leading up to a point
here.
The point is that the game takes all day with American playing
three-and-a-half hours with four breaks, (and don't forget the two-hour
party before the match), and that is why pre-match and in-match
entertainment is provided, and also the Yanks love a dose of
razzamatazz. And this is where the cheerleaders come in. So when the
Americans brought World League here they brought the cheerleaders, too.
There were twenty-seven girls trying out in Edinburgh on Saturday, and
thirty-seven terpsichorean hopefuls on Sunday in Glasgow. Dawn Peterson,
in charge of the cheerleader team, herself here for over a
year-and-a-half and from California, told me that they get more girls
from Glasgow than from the east.
''Maybe Glasgow girls are a little more vivacious, and that's a lot of
what we look for.''
Texan Will Wilson, the PR for the Claymores, agreed with Dawn when she
said what they looked for was personality, dance ability, enthusiasm,
and confidence. ''Zip, Zing, and Vim ?'' I asked, ''How about
prettiness?'' I am not a sexist for nothing. Dawn promptly told me that
all girls are pretty anyway, and that was certainly true of all the
lassies who turned up at both venues.
The Claymores will take twenty-four to twenty-eight girls for their
troupe, all have to be eighteen or over, and all have to be good at
their business.
There's a lawyer, schoolteachers, all sorts, quite a lot of
professionals too.
One professional was a girl whose quality I recognised instantly, she
was that enervating. Turned out she was a member of the cheerleaders
team last year too, (all the previous team had to compete for their
places this year as well), and ran three dance schools in Glasgow,
Pamela Don. She teaches over 150 kids in her schools in Maryhill,
Easterhouse, and Springburn. Tap, ballet, majorette, modern, and disco.
But there were others who just want to do this. Hilary O'Connor, from
Limerick, a physiotherapy student at Caledonian, 19 and splendidly fit.
''Why did you turn up? Why do you want to do this?'' I asked. One of my
favourite words emerged. ''Fun'' she replied.
These girls would, most of them, do it for nothing but in fact The
Claymores pay surprisingly well. It is 10 quid an hour, and #45 for an
entire game. A lot of sponsorship goes on too and the girls have got to
be outgoing and able to express themselves. (Part of the trial testing
is an interview to see how well the girl can communicate). Ibrox,
Tyncastle, Easter Road have all had displays from the squad, and this
month's Coca-Cola Cup final will see them performing at Hampden.
The last word goes with the choreographer for NFL Oakland Raiders,
actress and pro cheerleader Romana Braganza, who was taking the girls
through their paces. Romana, an astoundingly beautiful lady from just
outside Toronto, said that Scottish girls tended to be a bit reserved
and ''very, very polite, but very easy to work with'' Ramona, this has
been by no means my experience, I can tell you. Maybe cheerleading is
different from journalism at that.

PETER Nicol's spectacular career went into reverse following a tonsils
operation in June, but the Scottish champion is convinced he can
re-engage top gear in the World Squash Open starting in Nicosia, Cyprus,
today.
The 22-year-old from Inverurie is seeded three -- the draw was
announced before his drop to No.8 in the world rankings last week -- and
he has been fortunate to have been given a relatively straightforward
passage to the semi-finals, and a likely meeting with six times winner,
Jansher Khan.
''It took me longer than I expected to recover from the operation, but
I'm now feeling great,'' said the London-based player.''I feel I am
playing my best ever squash, at least in practice sessions.''
The question is: can he transfer his confidence to the biggest event
of the season?
''I think I can,'' he continued. ''I won the Canadian Open last month
and that gave me a real lift. The draw is good, and I certainly hope to
get through to meet Jansher.
''I'm also hoping that he has a few tough matches before he gets to
the semi-finals.''
Nicol was the first Scot to reach the last four in a World Open in
Barcelona a year ago, and a repeat -- or better -- would help his climb
back up the rankings, and also be the perfect start to a lucrative run
of Super Series events that will have him playing in Pakistan, Qatar and
India before Christmas.
He opens his account today against the Egyptian world No.25, Amir
Wagih, and a win would give him a day's rest before his last 16
encounter.
For Jansher, the aim is to overtake his legendary countryman Jahangir
Khan by becoming the first player to win seven world titles.
Martin Heath, the Scottish No.2 from Oban, advanced to his first World
Open when he beat Egypt's Omar El Borolossy in yesterday's final
qualifying round.
He now faces Finland's Sami Elopuro in today's first round proper, and
could meet Nicol if both Scots advance to the second round.
A Cyprus Women's Open is taking place alongside the men's world event,
and Scot Senga Macfie, the world No.21, meets thirteenth ranked New
Zealander Phillipa Beams in the first round. Results:
Men: Qualifying results, first round -- M Heath (Scotland) bt J
Wellings (England) 15-12, 15-7, 15-2; M Z Gul (Pakistan) beat S Cowie
(Scotland) 11-15, 15-8, 15-10, 15-11. Second round -- Heath bt O E

SCOTLAND'S top two teams last season, Livingston Bulls and Glasgow
Brightsiders, both lost their unbeaten Scottish League records at the
weekend. Champions Livingston were without their Great Britain star Iain
Maclean for their trip to the American Navy base at RAF Edzell on
Saturday night and paid heavily, going down 77-75.
But Glasgow were unable to capitalise, beaten 73-70 by Paisley at
Linwood yesterday. Paisley led 39-35 then fell behind in the second half
and trailed until the final minute. Scottish cap Drew Grimsley was the
man who did most damage for the Buddies, scoring 27 points.
Edinburgh Burger Kings are now the only unbeaten team in the men's
first division and they meet Glasgow next Sunday.

JIM Mailer won his second domestic title of the season yesterday at
the Cockburn Centre, Glasgow.
The Stirling player took victory at the Scottish Invitation Singles
when his opponent, Bruce Flockhart, retired after two games in the
final.
''I'm pleased to win,'' said Mailer, ''But obviously I'd have liked to
have won after three games, just to prove a point.''
Flockhart, who defeated Mailer in the final of this year's National
Championships, enjoyed a meteoric rise up the world rankings earlier
this season but has strugged with a back injury for more than a month.
The 23-year-old also twisted his ankle while leaping up for a smash in
the first point of the second game, the Stirling University sports
scholarship student floundering from there on in, despite having won the
first by a convincing 15-10. He decided not to continue after losing the
second 15-5.
London-based Scottish champion Anne Gibson, who had missed the event
for three years through injury, underlined her recent superb form abroad
with a 11-8, 11-6 victory over Gillian Martin in the women's final.
Results:
Men: J Mailer (Stirling) beat K Scott (Guildford) 15-4, retired; B
Flockhart (Stirling University) beat C Robertson (Fauldhouse) 17-14,
15-4; Mailer beat Flockhart 10-15, 15-5, retired.
Women: A Gibson (Marlow) w/o E Allen (Edinburgh) scr; G Martin (West
Strathclyde) beat K McEwan (Bridge of Weir) 11-3, 11-9; Gibson beat
Martin 11-8, 11-6.

THE top of the first division became congested over the weekend when
the top four sides going into Saturday's games had to settle for draws.
Only two points separate Grange, Menzieshill, Western, Ciba Kelburne,
and Touche Ross Gordonians.
Menzieshill's were the side which benefited most from the equality of
the frontrunners, for their 1-0 victory in the Tayside derby against
Torbrex Wanderers lifted them from fifth to second, just one point off
the pace.
The match of the day between Grange and Western certainly lived up to
its billing, with four goals shared.
The confrontation between Ciba Kelburne and Touche Ross Gordonians was
equally absorbing. Two goals by Gordon Moore helped Kelburne to
establish a 3-1 advantage which they held until 10 minutes from the end.
Paul Doney was the man directly responsible for starting Gordonians
revival. He reduced the leeway when Gordonians had been reduced to 10
men with Andrew Milne in the ''sinbin'', but then Milne returned to the
action to become their hero by scoring the equaliser.
Kerr Thomson scored his sixth goal of the season in the 60th minute to
give Insights Inverleith a 1-0 victory over Pender Uddingston, while a
double from Andrew Kay paved the way for MIM's 5-1 victory over
Clydesdale to maintain their excellent revival after a disastrous start
to the campaign.

DOMINIC Cork bowled himself back into the groove while Robin Smith
watched another day pass by without a run to his name.
Cork, the shining new recruit of last summer, made encouraging use of
England's decision to make victory their first priority at Buffalo Park.
The Derbyshire all-rounder finished with match figures of eight for 81
as a weak Border side were trampled by an innings and 53 runs.
With Mark Ilott, who claimed five for 36, and Darren Gough among the
wickets, England can leave this seaside town reasonably happy about
their overall state of health.
Smith, however, has gained nothing but a few extra worry lines from
the visit and now, at best, there are only two more innings for him to
show he is worth a place in Thursday week's first Test.
Cork, whose first summer as a Test cricketer ended with 26 West Indian
wickets at 25 runs apiece, sparked Border's slump on Saturday when
striking three times either side of tea.
Yesterday, he improved his analysis to five for 48 by trapping South
African Test batsman -- and recent Derbyshire team-mate -- Daryll
Cullinan lbw before shattering the stumps of Makhaya Ntini. With Gough
also picking up two victims, Border subsided meekly from an overnight
153 for six to 166 all out.
England could have ignored the follow-on option, opened with Smith
second time around, and then watched anxiously as he tried to recover
from a sequence of scores reading four, nought, and nought.
Instead, Alec Stewart went for the jugular. ''It wasn't really a hard
decision,'' said the acting captain. ''We wanted to win the game and our
bowlers hadn't bowled many overs on tour.''
It was Ilott who starred during Border's brief second innings, winning
two lbw decisions, engineering a couple of catches behind for Jack
Russell (the first of them a splendid leg-side effort) and forcing
middle-order batsman Steve Pope to chop on.
Gough removed Cullinan after a dogged innings of 55, and with Cork
adding three more victims Border were all out for 132.
* ENGLAND A produced another competent day in the field on the first
day of their four-day game against a Combined XI at the Defence Stadium
in Karachi.
Losing the toss, the tourists did well to restrict the hastily put
together opposition for just 204 runs.
Test discard Ian Salisbury led the way with four for 72 from 23 overs.
Openers Nick Knight and McGrath did a sterling job when England
replied, scoring 47 entertaining runs.

Stewart's sterling effort counts for nought in relay.
GLEN Stewart joined the Allan Scally Relay elite on Saturday, only the
seventh Scot in 27 years to break 22 minutes for the 4.8-mile course in
the prestigious four-stage Shettleston road event.
But his landmark run came too late to gain him inclusion in a new
Scottish elite group -- indeed, it could not even bring his team, Leslie
Deans Racing Club, victory in the race.
When Stewart handed a 21-second lead to Olympic steeplechaser Tom
Hanlon, victory appeared a formality. But the host's Graeme Wight
produced an inspirational run to capitalise on inexplicable fragility
from Hanlon and deliver one of the most memorable successes in
Shettleston's history, only their third win in 15 years.
The winning time, 89min 19sec, was a record for the 4 x 4.8 mile race,
and three of Shettleston's experienced winning quartet -- Wight, John
Mackay, and Billy Coyle -- clocked their best individual performances.
The fourth, Adrian Callan, had his second quickest time. It was also the
first time that each member of a winning team had been inside 23
minutes.
When he caught Hanlon before half distance, Wight increased his tempo,
scorched past, and never looked back.
Hanlon, the man most likely to have challenged Stewart's time, might
have been doped with kryptonite for his lack of response. ''I am not
tired,'' he said afterwards. ''There was just nothing there.''
Recent good training seems to rule out any hangover from a flu virus
three weeks ago, and his clubmates are confident Hanlon will be fit for
the Barr's Edinburgh-Glasow relay a week on Sunday.
''It will turn out all right in a fortnight -- easy. You wait and
see,'' predicted Racing club's founder, Alan Robson, referring with
justification to their prospects in the the eight-stage race which is
the winter's principal road event.
Leslie Deans not only finished runners-up, also inside their own
four-year-old record, but their B and C squads were third and fourth --
the only club ever to fill three places in the first four.
Robson's personal performance gave him less pleasure however. He has
decided to drop himself, his first absence in a decade, since recovering
from being scythed by a motor bike in Australia in 1984 -- an injury
which left him with a pin in his leg, and a permanent gait problem which
is now taking its toll.
Racing's Ian Brown had six seconds to spare over Coyle on the opening
leg, but Mackay, married to the grand-daughter of the man whom the race
commemorates, sprinted past Davie Ross, giving Shettleston a two-second
lead.
It was Callan who brought the best out of Stewart, on his heels till
half distance, but forced to leak 21 seconds by the final changeover.
Putting Stewart's run into perspective, the only Scots to have run
faster are Nat Muir, Allister Hutton, John Robson, and Jim Brown -- all
at the peak of their careers.
Muir, course record-holder at 21-26, was the world's third fastest
5000m man, Hutton London Marathon winner, Robson Commonwealth 1500m
bronze medallist, and Brown world junior cross-country champion.
Those to have run fastest laps over the years, but slower than
Stewart's on Saturday, include Commonwealth internationalists Dick
Wedlock and Gareth Bryan-Jones, four-times Scottish cross-country
champion Andy McKean, and World and European junior 1500m champion
Graham Williamson.
Which makes it all the more surprising that Stewart has just learned
he does not qualify for the Scottish Athletics Federation's new
performance elite group. The 20 names were supposed to have been
announced last week, and if Stewart, the country's No.2 1500m runner
behind European indoor champion David Strang, can be omitted, then it
suggests there could be further glaring anomalies to provoke outrage
when the squad is finally revealed.
Stewart's father, the former Commonwealth 10,000m champion, Lachie, a
dental technician, said he would provide the financial backing which his
son will be denied as a result of exclusion. ''After all,'' he said
pointedly, ''Glen is already a good deal faster on this course than I
ever was.''
Lynne McIntyre, the former Olympic 1500m finalist, clocked the fastest
individual time to lead City of Glasgow to victory in the women's race.
Strathclyde took the Scottish Universities' relay title, and Teviotdale
the Blair Trophy, presented by Springburn for a contest open only to
Scotland's 100-year-old clubs. Details:

CRICKET
CRAIG McDermott has been recalled by Australia for the first Test
against Pakistan starting in Brisbane on Thursday.
The experienced fast bowler replaces off-spinner Tim May and returns
to the squad for the first time since spraining an ankle during
Australia's tour of West Indies earlier this year, which forced him to
return home.
May was one of three Australian players -- alongside Shane Warne and
Mark Waugh -- who alleged Salim Malik had attempted to bribe them during
the Pakistan tour.Malik has since been cleared of the charges by a
judicial inquiry -- although the Australian trio stand by their
statements -- and ironically May dismissed the former Pakistan captain
during their drawn tour match with South Australia in Adelaide
yesterday.
Michael Bevan, who enjoyed great success as Yorkshire's overseas
player last season, and Ricky Ponting have been unable to displace Greg
Blewett from the squad.
Bevan has hit 370 runs at an average of 123.33 this season, including
two unbeaten centuries, as he seeks to extend his six-test career.
Ponting, who toured New Zealand and the West Indies this year, hit an
unbeaten 118 and 100 against Queensland in Hobart this weekend, and has
scored 281 runs at an average of 140.50 runs this season.
But Blewett has scored centuries against Queensland and Pakistan for
South Australia.
Malik fell cheaply when he was stumped for 16 in the tour match. His
departure left Pakistan struggling at 79 for four on the fourth and
final day.
But an unbeaten century by Basit Ali steered the tourists to a draw.
Chasing a victory target of 366 in three sessions, the tourists were 298
for five at the close.Basit Ali, who scored 101 not out, shared a
crucial century partnership for the fifth wicket with Inzamam-ul-Haq,
who was eventually trapped lbw by fast bowler Mark Harrity for 96.
May, who has threatened to take legal action against anyone who
suggests he concocted his charge against Malik, appeared jublilant when
he dismissed the veteran right-handed batsman.
Early in his spell, May appeared to have words with Malik as the two
rivals crossed paths in the middle after a Pakistan run.
South Australia captain Jamie Siddons introduced May into the attack
on Sunday after Malik had been at the crease for three overs.
After lofting a delivery from May over mid-wicket for four, Malik was
dismissed when he attempted to repeat the shot four overs later. Malik
charged down the wicket only to lose his balance, giving wicketkeeper
Tim Nielsen an easy stumping and prompting a celebration by the home
side.

LINDA McKay's impressive goalscoring exploits continued at the
weekend, when the Hyndland centre-forward scored her fourth hat trick of
the season in the Glasgow side's runaway 7-1 victory over Heriot-Watt
University.
This brings her tally to 16 in just six games this season and she has
now helped Hyndland become geniune contenders for the first division
title.
Hyndland have now moved ahead of Western Klick Photopoint into second
place -- and to within three points of leaders Edinburgh Ladies.
However, defending champions Western have a game in hand on the pair
of them.
The emergence of Hyndland as contenders is certainly good, not just
for the competition but also for the sport in general for Western have
had it much too easy for too long.
The ease with which Hyndland disposed of Heriot-Watt -- captain Sharon
Duncan also grabbed a hat trick -- strengthens the argument that their
form is no flash in the pan. Indeed, like Edinburgh and Western,
Hyndland are unbeaten in the current campaign.
South-West, who technically don't exist as a fully-fledged district,
walked off yesterday with the Inter District Under-16 girls'
championship at Linwood, ahead of their more powerful neighbours, West.
West, however, had the final say in the senior event at Scotstoun,
where they edged out their great rivals, East, who were left disputing
second place with South.

GLASGOW solicitor Stuart Morrison flew to Australia at the weekend to
see Quick Ransom, in which he retains a third share, attempt to beat
former stable companion and hot favourite Double Trigger in tomorrow's
Melbourne Cup.
The seven-year-old gelding, who won the Tote Ebor Handicap, the
November Handicap, and the Northumberland Plate, finished well down the
field in the Flemington Classic last year.
He has failed to win a race since making his home down under, but a
recent improvement in form has encouraged his owners and Australian
trainer Lee Friedman to run him in the big race.
Before leaving on Saturday, Morrison said: ''He didn't run well in his
first season in Australia, but he has been showing something of his old
sparkle recently, finishing third in a Group race, the Moonee Valley
Cup, which is regarded as a trial for the Melbourne race.
''The phone lines from Australia have been red-hot encouraging me to
go out and see him run,'' he said.
Morrison believes that unlike Double Trigger, Quick Ransom is now
fully acclimatised to the Southern hemisphere and with a weight
advantage of 19lb could fare much better last year.
Mark Johnson, who trained Quick Ransom before he went to Australia and
is responsible for the all-conquering Ascot Gold Cup winner Double
Trigger, agreed with Morrison that it could be ''tight'' between the
two.
Quick Ransom, whose odds have fluctuated between 10-1 and 8-1, is
likely to start third favourite.
A year ago Morrison sold a two-thirds share in Quick Ransom to
Australian Wayne Heathcote to raise the #45,000 necessary to send horse,
trainer, and jockey to Melbourne.
Heathcote had an option to take up the remaining share in June but
declined because of the horse's poor form.
Double Trigger, who completed a brilliant treble for Johnston by
winning the Ascot, Goodwood, and Doncaster Cups, has been installed as a
short-priced favourite, despite his defeat in the Prix du Cadran, much
to the annoyance of Johnston who believes his odds should be around
12-1.
The four-year-old gelding has strong Scottish connections. Not only is
his trainer from Aberfoyle but owner Ron Huggins, managing director of
Kimberley-Clark, was born in Dundee and lived there until the age of 10.
Although Johnston was far from confident on his arrival in Melbourne
last week, he is now much happier. Since being reunited with Jason
Weaver, his regular jockey, Trigger has been ''bucking, kicking, and
biting'' which his trainer regards as a good sign.

FOURTH DIVISION ROUND-UP
KILMARNOCK and Glasgow Southern ground out victories over Wigtownshire
and Langholm to maintain their promotion push, while at the bottom
Edinburgh Wanderers' brave fight came desperately close to reward
against Gordonians.
Kilmarnock got home 37-3 at surely-doomed Wigtownshire. The home side
would have to win all three remaining games to stay in the Premiership
with not a point in the bag so far.
Killie got well on top in the second half and could have won more
handsomely. Peter McIntyre scored two tries out of six, and they were
the pick. The first was a solo effort from 40 metres; the second saw him
make good use of a fortunate bounce. The others came from Robbie
Stewart, Joe Hobson, Tony Finnigan, and Robin Carswell, with Phil Gordon
adding two conversions to his penalty.
Ten minutes into the second half at Braidholm, Southern took their
points total against nearest rivals Langholm to 29 with a try from
Stuart Simcox converted by James Dunlop. From the restart, the crimson
jerseys were awarded a penalty and Gary Brannan kicked his third from
four attempts -- and there the score stuck.
In truth, it was poor fare throughout for the good crowd as Southern
persisted with a driving nine-man style, based on Gavin Walsh and Ian
Smith, but missing the injured John Clinkenbeard to burst into real
dynamism in the face of dogged Langholm resistance.
Persistent Southern pressure towards the end of the first quarter saw
Sandy McDougall, Walsh, and Simcox each over the line, but with referee
Dougie Hunter unable to award a touchdown. Finally, from a scrum in
front of the posts, the ball was moved right and full back Andy Haley
cut through for the try.
Simcox's second-half try ended a similar piece of pressure; the lanky
No.8 learning from his earlier disappointment by driving over much
lower. James Dunlop put over both conversions and five penalties.
Ayr trailed Haddington 16-15 at the turn but moved through the gears
thereafter to score nine tries in a 58-16 home success. Andy McLean had
three of the tries and Justin Horne two, while the visitors' early
counter came from George Gow.
Wanderers trailed 13-6 at the turn but fought back to 16-16 with the
sands trickling away. A penalty to win it from Carl McWilliam shaved a
post but when a foolish misdemeanour presented Gordonians' Bruce Doney
with a similar opportunity he made no mistake.

THIRD DIVISION ROUND-UP
A 60-5 win for Glasgow Academicals at Corstorphine not only relegated
the home club but regained for the Anniesland outfit the lead in the
points-scoring stakes, while taking them to the brink of promotion.
They led only 12-0 at the interval, but Corstorphine were already
wilting and lost hooker Brent Short soon after the turn. Flanker David
Williamson called on his experience as a hooker to move to the front row
only to have his nose broken within two minutes.
Corstorphine brought on their second and last replacement and scrums
became non-contested, which was of mixed advantage to Accies' strong
pack. When Corstorphine lost another man they had no further
replacements.
Accies' right winger Torquil Mathewson's debut inclusion in the
Glasgow team brought the end to his try-scoring drought as he grabbed a
hat trick.
Two were collected by both John Mason and Jeremy Hart with singletons
to Matt Begley, Stuart Simmers, and Calum MacGregor, who converted half
the touchdowns.
Biggar, remain in second spot, after living dangerously for the second
week! They led Musselburgh 13-10 at the turn thanks to a try from Simon
Reed, converted by Denis Lavery, who also kicked an early penalty. But
the visiting pack dominated the last 10 minutes of the half and began
the second similarly, so that when a penalty by Neil Lockhart was
followed by a Cliff Livingstone drop goal Biggar looked on the way out.
However, Lavery equalised with a penalty five minutes from time and
took the points with another to close the game.
So the stage is set for next week's clash between third-placed
Kirkcaldy and Biggar. The Fifers turned 17-8 behind at Preston Lodge,
the homesters having registered tries through Mark Hastie and Grant
Suttie, both converted by Rodney Gibb, who also dropped a goal.
But downhill in the second half, Kirkcaldy came on to their true form.
Craig McDonald took a lineout tap to go over and add to Neil Renton's
earlier try. Captain Willie Anderson emphasised his half-time call to
arms by scoring himself and McDonald did so again with John Mitchell
adding two conversions to his early penalty.
Grangemouth threw themselves a lifeline with a deserved home win over
Peebles, who actually led 17-15 at the end of a disjointed first half.
The home back row then got on top, providing choice possession for the
backs. A classy try from Mike Parsons put Grangemouth ahead and scrum
half Phil Horne rounded off a push-over score to see them home 27-17.
* EDINBURGH have been forced to make three changes to their side for
Wednesday's game against Western Samoa at Inverleith.
Douglas Wyllie, named as captain of the Edinburgh side, has withdrawn
because of business commitments and is replaced at inside centre by
Gordon Lawrie of Heriot's FP.
Ally Donaldson of Currie will now lead the side.
The other changes are at loosehead prop where Ross McNulty of
Stewart's-Melville FP moves from the bench in place of Grant Wilson, who
has been promoted to the Scotland A team, and at scrum half where Graeme
Burns, injured on Saturday playing for Stewart's-Melville FP, is
replaced by his understudy, Graham Beveridge of Boroughmuir.
As a result these alterations to the team,there are three changes on
the bench. Barrie Stewart of Edinburgh Academicals is now the
replacement prop, Fraser McMillan of Heriot's FP the reserve scrum half,
and Lindsay Graham of Biggar the cover for the midfield positions.

SCOTLAND under-21 caps Craig Sangster and Alan Bulloch are two of the
five newcomers in the Glasgow side to face the South African provincial
side Griqualand West at Hughenden a week today (kick-off 7pm).
The other debutants for the district side are Torquil Mathewson, a
prolific try scorer for third division leaders Glasgow Academicals,
Andrew Garry -- the experienced Watsonians centre, who played at New
Anniesland before moving east -- and Matt Begley, the elder of the two
Begley brothers.
The Glasgow selectors, unable to call on any of the Scotland or
Scotland A members, did not consider injured players Angus Turner, Jim
Brough, Shade Munro, or Alan Watt and were resquested by the players
themselves to ignore David Barrett and Stuart Simmers.
Griqualand West, who won the Finbank Cup, the trophy contested by the
smaller provincial sides in South Africa, opened their tour of Britain
and Ireland with a 10-16 defeat by Leinster before losing heavily to
Ulster by 10-54.
Glasgow XV -- C Sangster (Stirling County); T Mathewson (Glasgow
Academicals), A Garry (Watsonians), C Simmers (Edinburgh Academicals), G
Breckenridge (GHK); C MacGregor (Glasgow Academicals), F Stott (West of
Scotland); J Gibson (Stirling County), G Bulloch (West of Scotland), B
Robertson (Stirling County), M Begley (Glasgow Academicals), M Norval
(Stirling County), F Wallace (Boroughmuir) captain, J Lonergan (West of
Scotland), M Wallace (GHK). Replacements from H Bassi (GHK), A Bulloch
(West of Scotland), C MacRobert (Stirling County), J McLeod (GHK), J
Weston (Watsonians), C Little (GHK), C Docherty (GHK), G Doran (Glasgow
Academicals), G Perrett (West of Scotland), A Ness (GHK).

LIDHAMA can atone for earlier frustrations by landing the Sabre
Handicap on the last race at the last meeting of the Flat turf season,
writes White and Gold.
She let down her supporters when heavily backed for a handicap on this
track last month, lacking the pace to cope with a fast nine furlongs and
finishing no better than third.
And she could finish only second when stepped up to a more suitable
mile and a half at Newmarket last time.
However, that latest performance was made to a look better when the
winner Snow Princess followed up at Doncaster on Saturday. Lidhama is
favourably weighted and is ending the season in fine heart.

Selkirk 21, Dundee HS FP 16
SELKIRK'S fourth victory at home puts them among the cluster of teams
with 10 points in a tight second division table.
However, the performance of Dundee HS FP, also in that group of five
sides, did not exactly please their coach, Tom Dymock. ''We played our
worst game of the season, which is saying something,'' he commented.
''Our decision-making was awful and we just didn't do anything
constructive.
''The players sweated, but they left their brains in the changing
room.''
It was certainly a very untidy contest, frequently interrupted by
penalties, most of which were for off-side offences, although both teams
found it hard to maintain their discipline as the game moved towards the
finish.
Dymock was reluctant to criticise the new league set-up for the
tension and edginess of much of the play. ''It's better than the
three-week gap between games that we used to have,'' he remarked. ''But
John Rutherford (the Selkirk coach) was saying afterwards that surely
the players can't enjoy it because it's too pressurised.''
Selkirk led after five minutes with a well worked try in the corner
from full back Rodney Pow, but Paul Rouse touched down between the posts
for Dundee six minutes before the interval, Chris Robinson converting.
The New Zealand stand-off added a penalty at the start of the second
half, but an excellent blind side run by his opposite number Scott
Nichol in 50 minutes produced a try for David Hunter, which Pow
converted.
Robinson landed two more penalties to regain the lead, but one from
Pow narrowed the gap to a point, and then from McConnell's lineout
catch, Nichol dropped a good goal with six minutes remaining.
Rutherford was anxiously looking at his watch as Dundee pressed in the
closing stages, but in injury time a late tackle by Derek Milne on
Nichol allowed Pow to put over another penalty.
Selkirk next face leaders Currie, while Dymock promised changes for
Dundee's meeting with Jed-Forest. They are already certain to be without
the influential Stewart Campbell, on Scotland A duty, while No.8 Tony
McWhirter will be with the Ireland Under-21 team.
Selkirk -- R Pow; D Hunter, D Gage, K Johnston, D Hulme; S Nichol, A
Lindores; B Johnson, D Graham, I Purvis, A White, K McConnell, S
Hamilton, R Evans, W Gentleman. Replacement -- S McKenzie for Evans

Currie 25, West of Scotland 14
ALLY Donaldson squirted the champagne around the dressing room a la
Nigel Mansell. It wasn't their victory over West that warranted the
cracking of the bubbly, but results from elsewhere confirmed that Currie
had earned promotion to Division 1 next season
The elation at Malleny Park was deserved, for no club in the second
division has put in more preparation in a bid to be the best.
Champers glass in hand, coach Bruce Macnaughton epitomised the
dedication when he said: ''The boys have earned this celebration. They
have worked hard for it, but they will be back four nights next week to
be prepared for the next match. We have three tough ones to go and we
are determined to go up as champions. Being promoted is not enough.''
Currie's commitment was evident from the start against West. They had
earlier expressed respect for the Burnbrae team after their first
encounter, so they were determined to put them firmly in their place in
this one.
Within eight minutes, they were 12 points up and already demonstrating
a stranglehold they would not relinquish. The home pack were psyched up
to play at speed, and their aggression was rarely matched by West,
certainly not in the first half.
Mark Blair and Graham Hamilton were dominating the lineouts, Bruce
Ward was denting the West midfield, and when the ball was whipped out to
fly-half Ally Donaldson, the Currie skipper, had all the time in the
world to make his options. And he rarely took the wrong one.
West, on the other hand, did not have the same urgency about their
game. Even if they did get to the breakdown first, the ball was ripped
from their grasp; lineout ball was uncertain in its delivery, and
skipper Fraser Stott was left to clear up a lot of garbage.
Behind them, the normally unflappable David Barrett was not at his
best. The occasional howitzer kick to touch did not make up for other
deficiencies, the worst of which was his lobbed passing to his backs.
There was no way the ball could be taken at pace and Alan Bulloch and
Rob Little showed willingness only to be denied the right kind of
service.
Currie's Donaldson, on the other hand, had the luxury of Bruce Ward or
David Wilson at his shoulder when Douglas Rogerson whipped the ball
back. The togetherness of the Currie team is something which will stand
them in good stead when they join the big boys next season. The
one-for-all and all-for-one attitude will take them out of many a
difficult situation.
West's backs' coach Sandy Service conceded his team were overcome by a
better side and gave credit to Donaldson for the manner he kept his
players involved.
Forwards' adviser Gordon Macpherson agreed that Currie were too good
for his men: ''They were much hungrier for the ball among the forwards
and showed up some of the inexperience we have in that area. It was just
as well Ally Donaldson was off with his kicking. We could have had a
real doing.''
On the subject of Donaldson's kicking, he did seem to have his boots
on the wrong feet when it came to his place shots. His failures with
four very kickable penalties and three conversions were truly out of
character. But he made up for his deficiency in other ways -- with his
leadership and he did score two tries.
The first came in three minutes, just after his first penalty failure.
Mark Blair, Graham Ellis, and David Wilson inter-passed before feeding
Donaldson, who sold a superb dummy before going over.
Big Kiwi full back Dean Sheppard got the next one with a forceful
intrusion into the back line on a pass from Mike Plumb. Donaldson
converted but missed a second penalty. West had a good spell about this
time and both Barrett and John Shaw were kept out before Rob Little put
over a drop goal in 20 minutes.
Donaldson had two more penalty aberrations while, in between, Barrett
slotted a beauty of a kick from 30 metres. Two minutes after the
interval, Bruce Ward zipped over for a touchdown from a superb lineout
catch by Graham Hamilton. Donaldson missed the conversion and right from
the restart Alan Bulloch caught out hesitant defending to score a good
try for West.
However, a minute later, to ribald applause, Donaldson kicked his
first penalty. Then, in 59 minutes, the plaudits were genuine when he
finished fine handling by Geoff Keen and Mike Plumb for his second try.
He missed the conversion and Barrett had the final score of the day -- a
penalty from 28 metres.
Currie -- D Sheppard; G Keen, M Plumb, D Wilson, S Forrester; A
Donaldson, D Rogerson; P Calder, G Ellis, C Boyd, G Hamilton, M Blair, B
Ward, S Logan, B MacNaughton.

GHK 49, Stewart's Melville 23
''THERE are three games to go, and we have to win them all to be sure
to avoid relegation -- but if we do we could end up challenging for
promotion.'' That was how Cammy Little summed up what remains of GHK's
campaign.
Those games are against Kelso, Dundee, and Selkirk, who along with
West and GHK are tied on 10 points each for equal third place, or equal
second bottom -- depending on how you look at it.
There were times on Saturday when one wondered why GHK were not up
alongside Currie as the Anniesland side created seven tries, several of
which were well nigh impossible to defend against.
From close range, two successive inside passes from young stand-off
John McLeod to the rampaging Andy Ness, and Chris Docherty sucked in the
college's defence, before McLeod released Tim Sanderson on the other
side and the centre angled his run to cross with ease.
Gerry Hawkes was given room by Murray Wallace's deft take and give and
the winger beat the Stewart's Melville defence with sheer pace, as did
Breckenridge and Graham Agnew for their second-half touchdowns.
The Stewart's Melville coach, Ian MacLean, reckoned that ''any side
which can compete with GHK at the lineouts can put them under
pressure.'' On the day, however, with Cecil du Plessis providing the
bulk and Kenny Wilson the telescopic reach, the home side were on top at
the throw-ins and they were able to call upon the vastly experienced
Walter Malcolm to aid and abet the robust Ness and Wallace, who fully
justified his selection for Glasgow, in the back row.
GHK were not alone in being able to call upon the services of
'veteran' campaigners. Stew-Mel required two second-half replacements --
and on came Julian Scott and one Finlay Calder. Ever the enthusiast,
Calder sees no merit in sitting young, aspiring lads on the bench when
older heads could be there instead.
Graham Stirling had a try and two penalties for all the college's
points before Mark Tweedie grabbed two late tries -- casually converting
the second as the visitors put a face on the scoreline which their
perseverance, if not their attacking prowess deserved.
GHK -- G Breckenridge; G Agnew, T Sanderson, H Bassi, G Hawkes; J
McLeod, C Little; S Gay, C Docherty, M Blackie, K Wilson, C du Plessis,
W Malcolm, M Wallace, A Ness.
Stewart's Melville -- G Stirling; A Huett, L Hamilton, D Wylie, M
Tweedie; F Pollock, G Burns; J Blackhall, A Cadzow, R McNulty, M Paton,
W Faulds, E Thomson, D Clark, N Penny. Replacements -- F Calder for
Paton (55min), J Scott for Burns (62).

Jed-Forest 23, Kelso 11
WHEREVER Gary Armstrong plies his rugby trade in the future, the
supporters will be treated to a class act.
Once again, in victory over neigbours Kelso, he stamped his authority
on a game which Jed-Forest always looked like winning.
That they did so by a relatively small margin was due to some heroic
defence by the visitors and an out-of-sorts kicking display from Chris
Richards.
The mid-week hero of Scotland's under-21 side slotted just two of
seven penalty goal attempts and one had to question the wisdom of his
having a go from far and difficult places when territorial gain seemed
the better option.
They are never known to count their chickens prematurely at Riverside
Park but, with Currie promoted, the race is on for the privilege of
joining them -- and Jed are looking good.
Richards opened the scoring with his fourth penalty goal attempt and
within two minutes the lead had been boosted when Kevin Liddle and Calum
Brown broke from a lineout to feed Gary, who grabbed his try at full
stretch. Richards converted.
Graeme Aitchison narrowed the gap with penalty goals on either side of
the interval.
Jed continued to press but until the third quarter had just a second
Richards penalty goal to show for their efforts.
Then came the breakthrough they needed, when Liddle broke from the
scrum base and was driven over for a try.
Kelso, famous over the years for their fast counter-attacks, were back
in the game within two minutes, when Jim Thomson finished off a storming
move detonated by Aitchison and taken on by Iain Fairley, Ben Mannion,
and Gordon Laing.
Again Jed laid siege to the Kelso line, and it was left to the star of
this show and many others, Gary Armstrong, to finish things off as he
touched down from a pushover by his forwards.
Of course, he will be missed if he moves across the Border, but there
cannot be one Scottish rugby follower who would grudge him a slice of
rugby's dripping roast from any table of his choice.
And we can always see him back in the dark blue of Scotland.
Jed-Forest -- C J Richards; K A Amos, A J Douglas, D R Hemming, M A K
Yule; G G Scott, G Armstrong; N A McIlroy, K W Barrie, G Kerr, A T I

Heriot's FP 34, Edinburgh Academicals 21
ONE of my hopes for this season is that Cameron Glasgow, who has been
a Scotland understudy for most of his career, finally wins that elusive
cap. He scored two spanking tries at Goldenacre just to remind the
selectors he is moving swiftly back to full fitness.
''I am not quite there yet,'' he said afterwards, ''and I am a bit
critical of some aspects of my performance. But I am getting sharper and
looking forward to playing against the Western Samoans for Edinburgh.''
The tourists themselves were among the spectators, bemused no doubt as
we all were as to why Heriot's, leading 29-7, almost went into terminal
decline. Full back Stuart Lang, the A team choice, and fly-half Terii
Rahui, who had both kicked well in the first half, would have had great
difficulty in connecting with the barn door.
Scott Murray won so much ball at the lineout for the visitors it was
positively embarrassing and Academicals cut the deficit to eight points.
They are fearful now of relegation, though I predict it will never
happen.
My money is on a 10-team league next season, with the District
Championship being given the heave-ho. Watch this space.
Seventeen points in the first eight minutes kept the hands warm.
Cameron Glasgow ignited the move which ended with his twin Tony
scampering over. Rahui, the obligatory Kiwi, converted, then kicked a
penalty.
At the other end, Chris Simmers darted past four defenders playing
statues and Brian Hay-Smith converted.
The game went quiet for a time, so much so that the announcer
commanded boys to stop playing football on the hockey pitch. I thought
their critical judgment was spot-on.
This goaded Heriot's to life and Glasgow C trotted in for his first
try, converted by Rahui. There followed the best try of the match,
Graham Dall sending Hugh Gilmour on a thrilling run which was finished
off by Mike Livingstone. Rahui again goaled.
When Livingstone grabbed a second, following a push-over maul,
Heriot's should have been on easy street. Instead they drove up a
cul-de-sac.
Academicals ran everything and were rewarded with two tries. Kevin
Troup dived in from a ruck, then Martin Waite, like a salmon upstream,
soared over the defence. Hay-Smith converted both.
Enough, glared the Glasgows. Tony gave to Gordon Lawrie who fed Cammy
and the victory was sealed. One was left with the impression neither
outfit is likely to be a force in Europe.
Heriot's FP -- S Lang; I C Glasgow, A Glasgow, G M Lawrie, H Gilmour;
T Rahui, F McMillan; M W Livingstone, K S Milne, S W Paul, J Turnbull, P

AT MEGGETLAND
Boroughmuir 18, Hawick 19
THERE's many a slip betwixt cup and lip. And with more than passing
reference to Peter Wright's lippy dismissal last weekend, Boroughmuir
discovered on Saturday that, so far as title chances go, there is, too,
many a slip twixt lip and cup.
Boroughmuir had put themselves in premiership pole position with a win
in hand over their championship rivals. That happy state of affairs
lasted exactly one week, and defeat by Hawick means that the chasing
pack is breathing hard on their collective necks.
By virtue of the fact that Grant Wilson has now been drafted into the
Scotland A side to play Western Samoa on Sunday in place of the injured
Alan Sharp, thus joining Derek Stark and Darren Burns in the A team
party, Boroughmuir have the requisite number of players involved to seek
a postponement of their game against Stirling County on Saturday, and
what has all the makings of a championship decider will now be played at
the beginning of next month.
It is likely, too, that Hawick's premiership tussle with Watsonians
also will be put back on the basis that they, too, have three players on
parade with the A team. Scott Welsh, who twisted an ankle on Saturday,
will receive treatment this week and faces a fitness test on Thursday
but, even if he were to be declared unfit, the postponement decision
would already have been made and the game would be unlikely to go ahead.
On Saturday, with so many players from both sides having at least one
eye on outings against the Samoans, it was understandable, but not
excusable, that there should have been a certain lack of focus abroad.
There was drama, certainly, as the lead changed hands and as 'Muir
clawed their way back to within a couple of points of victory but there
were too many unforced errors and technical aberrations for it even to
approach the kind of classic which the scoreline implies.
For Hawick, Derek Turnbull had another influential game in all of
those areas the opposition would much rather he did not have access to.
His opposite number Fergus Wallace, back in full-time action for the
first time with his new club after the summer leg-break, fitted into a
Boroughmuir back row which did not appear to be of an optimum blend and,
ring rusty as he is, he played well in the opening period but got just a
bit too loose for comfort in the latter stages. He did, though, have a
try and, with that opener out of the way, will surely reclaim the form
which makes him one of the best uncapped flankers in the country.
Welsh, who did not have a particularly profitable day with the boot,
kicked Hawick into the lead after 13 minutes. Boroughmuir, who had the
better of the early exchanges, went ahead five minutes later with a
Derek Stark try, the winger touching down after Easson, Lineen, and
Mardon had carved open the Hawick defence. Easson converted.
Welsh missed a couple of penalty attempts and, in spite of the fact
that 'Muir always looked as if they might ignite and then failed to do
so, that was it until the interval.
Wallace got his try two minutes into the second half after Lineen had
been pulled down just short of the line. The former GHK man did well to
birl out of a tackle and ground the ball for the try which increased the
'Muir lead. Hawick fought back with a Welsh penalty goal and a Gregor
Sharp try and Welsh kicked his side into the lead three minutes later
with a penalty goal.
Easson steered Boroughmuir back in front with another penalty goal
but, with Hawick beginning to exert a semblance of control, Keith Suddon
stormed in for a try to give the Greens a lead which was no less then
they deserved. Easson's second penalty goal cut the deficit to a single
point but by then the game had slipped away from Boroughmuir who were
thwarted by die-hard Hawick defence but, mostly, by their own failures
which would have a battalion of sports psychologists scratching their
heads in puzzled disbelief.

Melrose 25, Watsonians 20
GAVIN Hastings came within a whisker of repeating his life-saving act
of the Paris international when, at the Greenyards, he romped in under
the bar for a try that, with the conversion, would have given Watsonians
victory.
Melrose led 25-20 with three minutes left when lineout ball launched
Tom Smith. Andrew Garry then dummied and straightened and John Kerr fed
the charging Hastings. But that one-handed Kerr delivery had been
fractionally forward, so Melrose triumphed on the basis of their
first-half renaissance for 18-3 after 35 mintues, their superiority in
stealing ball and their effective mix of drive and spin.
Watsonians, who had started like hungry wolves, lost the initiative
then regained it, whilst putting together several entertaining passages
despite losing to injury Andrew Drought then, even more significantly,
Gordon Hannah. Their back division thus had to be rejigged, with Garry
at stand-off, Kerr at centre, and Neil Burnett on the left wing.
Doddie Weir didn't have it all his own way at the throw-in, the
promising Stuart Grimes, Cameron Mather at four, and Scott Aitken having
their moments in untidy exchanges. Weir, however, was a key figure in
close support play in which Robbie Brown and Kevin Allan made special
impact. Robbie Brown created a special niche with a try against
Watsonians for the fourth match in a row.
The less experienced Watsonians forwards still made their own imprint
in several thrilling individual sorties by Alan Kittle and Tom Smith,
and with Hannah a rumbustious support in penetrations achieved by Craig
Brown.
With the Western Samoa international only 13 days hence, it was
encouraging that Craig Chalmers showed intuitive feel for the sound
option and also registered his third league try of this series, Bryan
Redpath demonstrated unfettered zeal in sinking large and not so large
foes alike, and Rowen Shepherd -- while not in Olympic sprint class --
was secure in orthodox defence chores and made subtle choice in
intrusive running.
Fergus Henderson chose clever angles, set a captain's example in
rudder exchanges, and once saved a certain Graham Shiel try with
blistering crossfield cover. Garry brought practised hand and boot to
the pivot position and 18-year-old Jamie Mayer, the 14-stone son of
Mike, former Watsonians and Edinburgh prop, has the build and basics.
Gavin Hastings, although tightly policed, underlined again his superb
technique under high bombardment.
In a contest that had plenty of movement and several spells of
exciting interplay continuity, Gary Parker and Hastings each kicked two
penalty goals and two conversions. The try scorers were Robbie Brown
(smashing over from a ruck), Chalmers (with a cheeky feint after treble
recycling), Cameron Mather (following a Craig Brown-Hannah drive double
act), Derek Bain (after the ball travelled from his hands to knee to
ground and back to hands), and Weston (sniping low up the ruck fringe
after quickfire creativity involving Hastings, Henderson, Craig Brown,
Neil Ritchie, and Mather).
Melrose -- R J S Shepherd; A A Purves, D C Bain, A G Shiel, G A
Parker; C M Chalmers, B W Redpath; M G Browne, S Scott, K R Allan, R R
Brown, E M Simpson, S A Aitken, G W Weir, I Feaunati.

Stirling County 45, Gala 6
ONLY a rethink of the championship format can now save Gala from
joining the ranks of the second division clubs next season.
The final act of the ''Gala-dammerung'' was played out on the
Bridgehaugh stage where the Netherdale side, forced to make four changes
to their original selection, were further weakened by injuries to Neil
Crooks and Arnie Van Rooyen.
Maroon it seems is not this season's colour among the gods.
Peter Dods, the Gala coach, put his club's plight in context when he
stated: ''Grant McKenzie, the replacement for Arnie Van Rooyen, is our
fifth-choice scrum half. You can only field the best 15 guys
available.''
But when the ''best available'' includes a centre pairing plucked from
junior teams, it is easy to sympathise with Dods.
That said, Euan Anderson looked a good prospect for Gala but it was
too much to expect both he and the veteran Brian Learmonth to make the
instant transition to the demands of first division rugby. More so
against a backline of Stirling's calibre, six tries by the three
quarters testifying to their undoubted skill.
The match may have been something of a run-through for Stirling, but
if the Bridgehaugh side can replicate this kind of play in pressure
games, then a second title could still be theirs.
The contributions of Ian Jardine and Ken Logan are now taken for
granted at Bridgehaugh but it was encouraging to see many of the
attacking moves ignited by the rapidly improving Craig Sangster, who
maybe still has to learn a bit about the timing of his distribution but
who nevertheless looks an exciting player for the future.
Stirling are also benefitting from the dynamic play of their No.8
Gareth Flockhart, whose chance to prove himself this season may yet come
in the district championships.
He and Brian Ireland in harness with the hard working Dave Elliot (who
scored the forwards' only try), provided much of the continuity in
Stirling's play resulting in a field day for the backs.
Colin MacRobert was the initial benefactor of Stirling's ability to
keep the ball alive, but sadly for the young wing, a hamstring twinge
forced him to retire just before half-time, but not before he had used
his genuine sprint pace to run in two tries.
Ian Jardine also claimed a brace of touchdowns, the second from a move
started inside the Stirling twenty-two and made by strong running from
Sangster.
Matt McGrandles, now returning to the form of last season, looped
Logan for County's fifth try and Logan himself added his name to the
score sheet with a try from a rehearsed move used successfully against
Boroughmuir last season.
Who knows, it might be deployed again when the two sides meet at
Bridgehaugh in their rearranged, and possibly championship-deciding,
match on December 2.
Stirling County -- C Sangster; C MacRobert, I Jardine, M McGrandles, K
Logan; M McKenzie, K Harper; J Gibson, R Cairney, B Robertson, M Norval,
G Mackay, D Elliot, G Flockhart, B Ireland. Replacement -- A Sievewright
for MacRobert (37min).
Gala -- S Paterson; M Moncrieff, B Learmonth, E Anderson, C Dalgleish;
G Dalgleish, A Van Rooyen; G Isaac, J Graham, H Hunter, M Stoltz, R
Hogg, N Crooks, D Liddle, J Amos. Replacements -- G McKenzie for Van
Rooyen (26min), T Weir for Crooks (27min).
Referee -- D Ramage (Berwick).
SCORERS: Stirling County -- MacRobert, 2t; Jardine, 2t; McKenzie, 2c,

CAMERON Simpson's report about recruiting difficulties in the Army,
particularly for the infantry, was as accurate as it was timely
(November 2). The main problem would appear to stem from the fact that
while the thrust of the Options for Change review may have been entirely
appropriate, it also has had subsequent side effects.
It indicated to the public (and parents of potential male or female
recruits) that further manpower was not required, which could not be
further from the truth.
Some other measures, set in train by army planners (not Government)
cannot be helping either: for example, the closure of many recruiting
offices, as has been mentioned in the article. Are they barking down in
Whitehall?
However, the story is even curiouser. Recruiting for the six Scottish
infantry regiments is currently co-ordinated by Headquarters of The
Scottish Division in Edinburgh Castle. This very small HQ (of which I
once was a member) is being disbanded, or ''rationalised'', very
shortly, and moved nearly 400 miles south to Infantry Headquarters at
Warminster.
Quite how this can improve recruiting from an area which stretches
that far north from the Border is hard to imagine. In fact, the HQ, when
it gets down there, might be as well to circulate round fairs in the
West Country and recruit for Jocks among local Morris Dancing teams.
It's enough to make old-timers like me weep into those handkerchiefs,
instead of waving them in the air.

GEORGE HUME examines the work of an organisation which refuses to turn
its back on society's most vulnerable
A FIVE-year-old boy's treat yesterday, as on most Sundays, was an
outing for lunch. Supping alongside him was a former pop star, a
yesterday's jet setter who once had the world at his feet. The venue . .
. a soup kitchen in Edinburgh.
Queueing with the boy and musician were about 150 others, all of them
down on their luck, many victims of the Government's policy of care in
the community. The majority were homeless in Scotland's capital city, a
large number suffering from psychiatric disorder.
Three times a week monks offer soup at the Jericho Benedictine
Community centre in Lothian Street which also serves as a last refuge
home for 20 men and women rejected or evicted by every other social
agency because of their behaviour.
The Jericho Benedictine Community has been caring for Edinburgh's
abandoned folk for more than five years, its name taken from the parable
of the Good Samaritan. Alan Mair, officer in charge of the centre says:
''Jericho does not walk by on the other side -- will always care for
those whom society has rejected.''
That means tending, without stint, those who are disturbed, often
aggressive and violent, sometimes ill, doubly incontinent or crippled,
occasionally with zero motivation. ''Their behaviour, by and large, can
be described as challenging and for one reason or another no other home
will take them,'' Mair says.
''We are the final stop and, if we have assessed correctly, none of
those living here will ever go back into the community. We can give them
a quality of life they would not otherwise enjoy but the fact of the
matter is that when they leave here it will only be for the back ward of
a psychiatric hospital.''
In all, some 150 of Scotland's abandoned men and women are housed in
Jericho Benedictine Centres in Scotland -- in Greenock, Gourock, Port
Glasgow, Paisley and Dundee. In England there are four such hostels --
all of them in Wolverhampton. The founding force behind the Jericho
Benedictine Community is Father James Ferguson who opened the
community's first soup kitchen and hostel in Greenock to alleviate
homelessness.
Soup was the first step then a Portacabin as dormitory accommodation
before a proper bricks and mortar centre was established. Others soon
followed.
Funding for the Jericho centre in Edinburgh comes from the local
Social Work Department, #207 a week from the DSS for the upkeep of each
hostel dweller and a #150,000 annual grant made jointly by Edinburgh
District Council and Lothian Region. In the past year the centre's own
fundraising efforts have secured #95,000 -- some of which will be used
to open a subsidised cafeteria.
Most of those who are taken in and given a home are in the 45 to 65
age group and have been sleeping rough in the streets. Mair is scathing
of the care in the community policy that has let down so many of those
living in the Jericho Benedictine Communities ''These people have been
rejected by every other agency, have been set up to fail. When they come
here they have, literally, nowhere else to go -- no-one else to whom
they can turn. They are among the most vulnerable but care in the
community has not worked for them.''
The denim-habited monks of St Benedict run their Lothian Street soup
kitchen on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, all day Sunday. It is on
Sundays that the five-year-old arrives, he has been turning up since he
was a baby. His mother, deaf and dumb, was supported by the Jericho
Cntre during her pregnancy and now her child benefits not just from the
soup kitchen but from the others there who are helping him over-come
speech difficulties brought about by his mother's handicap and the
absence of a father to listen to him.
Mair says: ''When I am asked if people today -- as in the parable of
the Good Samaritan -- still pass by on the other side when they see
those in difficulty I have to answer 'yes'.
''The people here are stigmatised as winos, alcoholics and the like.
But the truth is that something has happened to them which the medical
profession does not yet understand. Until their descent into difficulty
they led perfectly normal lives, were in the professions and trades.
People should understand that in, say, six or seven years they too could
be in Jericho House.

Music
SEVEN years after his death, Kenneth Leighton continues to be admired
and performed in Scotland. As Edinburgh's Reid professor of music, he
composed symphonies, church works, and fine chamber music; but even
pieces written for his native Yorkshire, or other parts of England, have
sooner or later, made their way north of the Border.
One such piece is his Sequence for All Saints, performed by the
recently-founded Glasgow Chamber Choir on Friday. Written for the West
Riding Catherdrals Festival in 1978 it proved a typically terse
five-movement cantata for solo baritone, chorus and organ, culminating
in the clear, bright strains of Isaac Watts's hymn, Give Me The Wings of
Faith, in which the audience was invited to join.
In tone, and manner, the music could loosely have been described as
Brittenish. But the harmonic conflicts -- the interplay of euphony and
disturbing, curdled dissonances -- were true Leighton in their sense of
unease and in their final glowing affirmation.
In spite of the hard-edged acoustics of St Bride's, Hyndland Road,
Robert Marshall and his small chorus, with a lustrous topping of soprano
tone, projected the music tellingly. Philip Blackledge was the baritone
soloist, Peter Christie the organist.
A flowing account of Byrd's Mass for Five Voices, complete with its
Propers for All Saints, set Leighton's cantata in the context of five
centuries of the English choral tradition. So long as there are
composers of Leighton's calibre to contribute to it, it is a tradition
that seems unlikely to peter out.

YITZHAK RABIN will take a mass of contradictions to the grave on Mt
Herzl this morning; of a soldier who acknowledged weakness; of a hawk
who sought peace; and of a leader whose reticence and shyness were
legendary. He leaves a country which is shocked beyond belief by the
stark fact that one of its own sons should assassinate the Prime
Minister. The implications for Israeli society in this are large, but
the wider world community must consider what will happen to the search
for peace in the Middle East. It is inevitable that the peace process
will falter, at least for a while. It has already reached the stage when
an eventual Palestinian state appears inevitable, yet it is essential
that the timetable of military withdrawals from areas of the West Bank
is maintained. These are crucial to the holding of Palestinian elections
in January, in themselves of the greatest importance for sealing the
authority of Yasser Arafat and his administration. American support will
be essential in this, for security guarantees from Washington have been
an important element in keeping the bare majority of the Israeli
population which supports the peace process committed to the
Government's position. Israelis must also listen to those in Washington
who warn that any sign of withdrawal from the peace process will lose
support in the United States. There is probably nothing that can be done
at the moment to enhance the prospects of a peace agreement between
Israel and Syria. President Assad will have hopes in the medium-term
that he may gain concessions from Mr Peres that he could not squeeze
from Mr Rabin, but for the moment he will certainly sit back and let
matters resolve themselves within Israel.
The acting Prime Minister, Mr Shimon Peres, must steer a delicate path
through conflicting aims. His task will not be easy for he is well aware
that what confidence there was in the peace process on the part of the
Israeli public was present largely because of Yitzhak Rabin's
leadership. As a former military leader and advocate of firm security
Rabin presented a reassuring image. The Prime Minister, who in previous
years had conducted an appalling vendetta against his old rival Peres,
was only too willing to let it be known that Peres was the one pushing
for peace while as Prime Minister he sought peace also, but only when
stringent security guarantees were in place. Mr Peres, then, must make
it clear that the new Government which he will almost certainly lead
will not quicken the pace of the peace process. He must also seek to put
in high office a military figure who will be trusted by the public at
large and who will, in some respects, take over Mr Rabin's tough and
hawkish image. This can best be accomplished by promoting the young
Interior Minister and former chief of staff, Ehud Barak, to the post of
Defence Minister. There may also be room for elections to be held
earlier than those planned for November 1996. This would probably halt
the peace process temporarily, but it may also gather support for the
process in the aftermath of Mr Rabin's death.
If the path ahead politically can be discerned, however dimly, the
future of Israeli society is less clear. A strength has become a tragic
weakness. Israelis have always been rightly proud of their robust
democracy, characterised more often than not by political arguments of
startling ferocity.
That democracy has shone in a region dominated by despots, bullies,
and secret policemen. It has prospered even in times of great tension,
but these have largely been times when the tension and threats have been
applied from outwith Israel's borders. The tensions set off by the peace
process have been different for they have generated political debate
which has swung from the robust to the dangerous. At right-wing rallies
Rabin and his Government were regularly called ''murderers'' and
''traitors''. Rabin and others made clear their concern about the
dangers of political violence but a climate was established in which the
extreme, the demented, and the downright malevolent could plan terrible
things. Yesterday in Israel schoolchildren were counselled and told that
assassination was not the way in which a democracy operates; how sad
that this should be necessary. Politicians will say that the success of
the peace process will be the greatest tribute which could be paid to Mr
Rabin. That is true, but alongside it must be set the restoration of a
true democracy which has suffered much and which all must wish to see
healed.

IN the event of the next General Election producing a Labour
government with a clear majority there will be a parliamentary Bill to
provide for a new Scottish Assembly. On the findings of recent opinion
polls such a majority looks certain, but opinion still has plenty of
time to move. To win power Labour has to enjoy a considerable swing from
the last election, where how well Mr Major actually did has been
concealed by his relatively small parliamentary majority. The outcome
next time may also be complicated by the performance of the Liberal
Democrats who could do well enough to impose a coalition government
whether Labour wants one or not. The actual outcome, therefore, may be a
factor in determining the speed with which a Bill progresses through
Parliament. It will be contested strongly by the Tories, whose efforts
to retard it will depend on their morale, which in turn will be
influenced by the actual electoral outcome of seats and not just votes.
If there seems no doubt that a Bill will be presented, its timetable
is another matter. Labour has said that the Bill will be brought forward
in the first year of a new Parliament, but that should not be taken to
mean a promise that it will become an Act within the first year, and
that the first session will convene in Edinburgh after separate Scottish
elections inside the same time frame. Liberal spokesmen are beginning to
say openly what many parliamentarians have been saying privately for
some time -- it may prove impossible to push through the legislation
inside a year. It is a statement of the obvious, surely, to say that
demands on parliamentary time should not be allowed to botch the job --
it would be better to take 18 months to produce a sound, workable scheme
than to rush through something inside a year which would creak and groan
from its inception. Any proposals will have to be thoroughly debated and
although there may be attempts at filibustering, such a major
constitutional departure needs thorough exploration and debate.
Qualifying the notion that everything could be cut and dried inside a
year should not lead to accusations of bad faith. Scottish opinion will
not blame the framers of a new dispensation in our politics if they have
to hurry slowly. It would be a different matter if a slow pace were a
deliberate device to postpone something in which its apparent promoters
did not really believe. That would not be the case on this occasion and
Scottish opinion is simply being warned early that it may get its
Parliament a little late, or at least later than many would prefer.

KATE Donegan . . . the very name sounds Chandleresque, and indeed many
a thriller is built around Donegan's profession, but the problem is that
drama invariably gets it wrong. Donegan watched television's The
Governor, cringing throughout the series at all that unremitting
austerity: the slamming of cell doors, the oppressive air of people
being marched around and pushed about. An effectively run prison, she
says, doesn't resound with jangling keys. It has no need to operate like
that.
But such is the public's poor regard for the offices of law and order
just now that ''an effectively run prison'' is perceived as a
contradiction. The Home Secretary would have us believe that draconian
punishments are the surest means of shrinking crime statistics.
In England, however, many prison officers, angered and demoralised by
Michael Howard's peremptory treatment of their former director-general,
Derek Lewis, see the Government's proposals as a time-bomb which would
be imposed at colossal cost to the taxpayer, only to be detonated by
inmate mutiny.
In Scotland, where the prison service has been radically restructured
since the riots and rooftop agitation of the late eighties, the
situation seems less fraught, less primed for confrontation. But
Donegan, formerly the deputy governor at Barlinnie in Glasgow, and now
No 3 at the Scottish Prisons Inspectorate, would be apprehensive about
any significant erosion of prisoners' privileges.
''Psychologically and emotionally, visits and the possibility of
remission are of tremendous importance,'' she says. Even the business of
anticipating that day's food plays a substantial part in maintaining a
jail's equilibrium.
There is a range of rights on both sides, she says, and prison
officers have to work positively towards gaining inmates' consent.
''They can only do that by understanding where the prisoner is coming
from. For our part we must never forget that our core purpose is custody
and order. We must keep secure all those who are sent to us but we must
try to do so in a way that promotes harmony and a safe environment all
round.''
Down south the problems between the Home Secretary and the prison
service, Donegan feels, are due to a failure of communication more than
irreconcilable differences. ''I think we all may be talking about the
same thing, really, but somehow the lines of discussion have become
confused. We all know about the expectations of society, but for us the
whole point of the exercise is not just to keep the bad guys locked away
but to try and rid them of a criminal mindset while they're with us. At
the end of the day that is what will lead to crime reduction.''
After 18 years of working in the service, which has included seven
years at the women's prison, Cornton Vale, and the deputy governorship
at Oscar Wilde's old slammer, Reading Jail, Kate Donegan is now the
senior woman in Scotland's prison service. It is a distinction she is
almost reluctant to acknowledge since she says she has never personally
experienced overt discrimination in the profession. What does dismay
her, however, is the near-invisibility of women in senior management
throughout Scotland.
''Generally we have the impression that the situation is getting
better but things are not moving as fast as they should. None of my
female colleagues, either inside or outside the service, is looking for
preferential treatment or a standard increase in the ratio of women to
men. But what they do seek is equal opportunity and that means opening
up recruitment systems in all careers so that the line of advancement
isn't only hierarchical.''
Open and transparent competition for jobs is what she has always
championed but that view became an active, clear-sighted credo between
1991 and 1994 when she was head of the Scottish Prison Service's
manpower planning, and later became a key figure in the service's
staffing structure review. This, says Donegan, produced a slimmer, more
robust organisation shaped to take on the growing challenge of
private-sector involvement in our jails.
''There is no such thing as an easy nick. Every one of them has its
special problems although in Scotland ours are undoubtedly less complex
than those of England where the prison population is around 57,000. And
because of its disparate nature -- the number of ethnic minorities, for
instance, and far more Category A prisoners -- the English prison
service has difficulty in developing a corporate identity.
''Here, our prison population stands at around 5000, and currently
there is no prisoner in the system whose behaviour is unmanageable,
though that certainly wasn't always the case.'' Since the public
perception is that more violent criminals exist today than previously,
what has caused this outbreak of docility within the pen? Could it be
that drug taking has subdued the most troublesome?
Donegan says it would be dishonest to suggest that the prevalence of
drugs in prison is not alarming the authorities, but she doesn't believe
there is a strong correlation between many drugs' taming effect and the
present manageability of prisoners. ''If you walk around a jail you do
not see zombies, for the simple reason that those on drugs inject,
ingest or smoke them at night.''
Most of the addicted hide the substances in their rectums, bringing
drugs into prison when they first arrive, or when they make outside
contact through visits or court appearances. The service, however, is
not permitted to search prisoners internally, and even if it were
Donegan feels that this duty might be unacceptably fraught, most
officers finding it inapproprate to have to hold down a reluctant,
screaming prisoner. There also is the question of whether such sensitive
examinations should belong to the medical sphere.
So what does account for the apparent calm? Donegan points to the fact
that officer-recruitment is now much more careful and targeted.
''I don't think the character of the prison population has altered. It
is fundamentally the same as it has always been but we are bringing in
to the service people who are much more prepared to be flexible in their
responses and who possess a whole range of inter-personal skills.
''Previously we weren't equipped with this kind of training, but the
rooftop troubles of the eighties were a catalyst for change. We knew we
had to take a hard look at ourselves and make sure the system worked
from both sides.''
What does worry her, though, is that the potential for disaster will
undoubtedly increase if longer prison services with no remission mean
overcrowded jails. ''I don't subscribe to the view that putting all
tough criminals together in one location is the road to hell. Instead it
is a challenge for us, and the service has certainly managed challenges
before.''
But neither does she believe in evil. ''I think we must see everybody
who steps over the threshold into prison as redeemable. If you believe
otherwise then you will eventually return to the community people who
are worse than when they came in.''
Donegan would like to see a data base compiled on ex-convicts'
successful re-entry into society as law-abiding citizens. ''At the
moment we only get the recidivist rate, but the other side of the story
would be most beneficial both to prisoners and officers.''
After so many years what still engrosses her about this necessarily
closed and disciplined world is the dynamic between custodian and
inmate. Her new job, which will probably last for a few years, is
clearly a career move designed to increase her working knowledge of
every Scottish prison, and some English institutions.
But her ultimate goal is to be appointed a governor on merit.
''Obviously there are senior jobs within the service that require
operational experience but I would far rather be in a prison.'' In fact
her only regret about her present inspecting role is that it has made
her remote from prison life.
''I actually do miss being with prisoners where the challenge,
different everyday, is to make all the disparate groups work together.
Now I only get to see the very good or the very bad prisoners, which is
a pity.''
Kate Donegan, daughter of a policeman, wife of a management
consultant, and mother of two sons, has only ever once been assaulted in
a jail and it happened when she was working in Perth.
''I ordered a cell search of someone who regarded himself as
all-powerful in prison culture.'' She had been on her rounds and felt
that this particular cell was a little over-furnished for security. ''He
felt affronted, and some time later -- I think it was in the laundry --
he threw a glass jar at my back which didn't actually do much damage but
it fell at my heels and cut me on the legs.''
The prisoner's actual aim was interesting. Did he choose Donegan's
back out of cowardice, or out of warped courtesy because he didn't wish
to maim a woman's face? She is statuesque, two inches off six feet,
assertive without being confrontational; someone who does not feel the
need to show who is the dominant one in any prison encounter.
Donegan says that the ideal prison officer must combine
self-confidence with teamwork and an ability for good banter and humour.
''And as there will be lots of vocal abuse, there is no room for
officers with chips on their shoulders, or for those who see prisoners
as enemies. What's needed is a lot of self-esteem.''
She downplays the tension and dangers which obviously do exist, and
finds personal distraction in a vibrant family life in Stirling, and her
part-time degree course in business studies and business law.
But striving wisely to improve the service for everyone's advantage is
very much a life-commitment, and you sense that throughout her career
those behind bars have sussed this out. When she was at Cornton Vale,
the women knitted in preparation for the birth of her sons. At Reading,
an illegal immigrant composed a poem for her; at Barlinnie another
inmate did the same.
And it was also there that the prisoners who worked in the garden
would bring Kate Donegan roses, without any awkwardness or guile. Small
virtues brightening up the sterile melancholy of jail.

AMID the glam and glitter of an Oscar-style occasion, we celebrated
far into the night at Aberdeen's Beach Ballroom on Saturday, as the
biennial bonanza of the Bafta Awards spread honours throughout the realm
of film and television.
Recorded and beamed to the nation last night, it was one of those
rather special events where the so-called media was much in evidence.
And when it was all over, in the grey dawn of a Sabbath day, I kept an
appointment with a very special gentleman for whom the word media would
have very little meaning.
In George Fraser's early days, that plural word had nothing to do with
the spreading of news and information. There was only a medium, and that
was the newspaper, which was so well read throughout the population
before the days of radio and television that people were remarkably well
informed on what was happening around the world.
For George Fraser entered journalism in Aberdeen during the First
World War and edited the news of those ghastly battles on Flanders
field, as well as the story which brought the welcome relief of
Armistice.
Before that war was over he was writing columns for his northern
readership, and the delightful news for those who value the continuity
of things is that he is still writing his weekly column 77 years later.
And what a model of journalistic perfection it is, a Saturday morning
gem which should be compulsory reading for anyone aspiring to the role
of writer.
He was telling readers last week of the man who once promised he would
paint the outside of his house if he lived to be 100. Well, my good
friend George will reach that milestone on Friday and, true to his word,
the painter turned up the other day and gave him a shining exterior.
With similar brightness, George Fraser's clear mind is reflected in
his weekly writing, conjured up nowadays from a more restricted
lifestyle but benefiting always from that deep well of experience and
imagination which the gift of the natural writer can mould to high
craftsmanship.
Such a man is George Fraser, who was my editor when I joined Aberdeen
Journals in 1950. He was then a very youthful 55, with a lively
intellect to match the briskness of his walk, the speed of his turn. I
suppose you could have speculated that, given the good luck of a sound
heart and clear arteries, he would survive longer than most of us.
When I visited him yesterday there was a chance to recall that he had
started life in 1895 at the village of Newmachar, north of Aberdeen,
where his father was the railway signalman.
This clever lad-o'-pairts went on to Aberdeen University with thoughts
of teaching but a chance meeting in Union Street with a fellow graduate
(later to be the distinguished author, Alexander Keith) diverted him to
the Broad Street office of Sir William Maxwell.
Thus George Fraser joined the old Daily Journal, one of four
sub-editors handling the war news from France as well as writing his own
column. At the end of that war he was working with a journalistic
colleague by the name of Leslie Mitchell, who became his rival for the
hand of a girl called Peggy in the cashier's office.
Peggy eventually married George but always kept the loving poems which
Leslie Mitchell had penned for her. Mitchell was, after all, the real
name of that greatest of north-east writers, Lewis Grassic Gibbon.
So here is a man with a clear recollection of the century in its
entirety. I have said before that we Scots do badly at acknowledging the
real worth in our midst.
But one lady who has not failed in that respect is Queen Elizabeth,
the Queen Mother. On her regular and lengthy stays on Deeside, I happen
to know, she is an avid reader of the Scottish papers -- and a
longstanding admirer of George Fraser's writing.
Nevertheless, it was with surprise the other week that George received
an invitation to come to have tea with his royal admirer at her Birkhall
home, near Balmoral.
He was a bit wary of such an occasion but was able to tell me
yesterday of how pleased he was that he had gone. Imagine the charming
scene of those two special human beings discussing an age to which there
are now few witnesses.
George had remarked on the fact that he was a Victorian. ''But so am
I!'' the Queen Mother reminded him. And, of course, so she is, albeit by
a narrow margin. So they talked with great warmth and affection in an
encounter which put the royal seal on the distinguished career of a
truly worthy Scot.
The omens had not been too auspicious when childhood illness left
George with the weakened heart which kept him out of the First World
War. They improved when Sir William Maxwell had welcomed him to
newspapers with the quip: ''Journalists live to be a ripe old age.''
And these turned out to be prophetic words indeed. As George Fraser
opens his house for a centenary buffet this week, knowing he is the
oldest working person in Britain, we'll raise our glasses for a very
special toast -- to our Grand Old Man of Letters.

JILL Crawshaw's three articles on her Scottish travels made riveting
reading (October 30-November 1). She is an excellent and fair travel
writer. We in the industry must heed her summing-up -- we can't like
much of what she says, but we mustn't shoot the messenger. There is no
denying so much of what she found, but don't let us wallow in gloom.
Let's have the guts to face up to our shortcomings, and appreciate all
she found to admire in Scotland, the beauty of the countryside in spite
of the awful weather she experienced, the excellence of what she found
in the two National Trust properties she visited, and how she
appreciated the King's House Hotel at Balquhidder, which proves to the
sceptics that her desires were for warmth, welcome, and good food. She
was not out to knock Scotland.
Now to the leader on November 1. Much of the comment was very fair and
true, but not all of it. There are many very good middle-of-the-road
hotels throughout Scotland, and I'd list ourselves among them.
Up until the end of October we had 4077 guests staying and we have had
two letters of complaint and very many of great appreciation. It amazes
us that guests should bother to write appreciative letters when they
have paid to stay.
But the only proof of people's satisfaction is their return. There has
been an increase in tourists to Scotland this year -- we have enjoyed
our busiest season in 22 years.
It is a way of life producing extremes -- of exhaustion and sheer
pleasure in job satisfaction -- and I do feel we must pay equal
attention to the plus side of our tourist industry, if only for economic
reasons. Tourism is the major employer in Scotland. The present chief
executive of the Tourist Board is, I believe, trying hard to create a
realistic marketing of Scotland.
By this, I mean that he is not portraying Scotland as having permanent
blue skies, but he is making a feature of our good and bad weather, of
the very many areas of excellence to be found throughout Scotland in
food, accommodation, sport (most notably, golf) and in generally
endeavouring to make tourism a year-round industry.
The attitude of some hotel and shopowners is awful, as Jill Crawshaw
found out -- I can't understand how they can't value their jobs more --
but the most important thing the STB could do is to put real pressure on
the Government to reduce the level of VAT paid by tourist-related
industries.
This would cut a swathe through the prices about which Jill Crawshaw
complained so justifiably. Other European countries do it. Why can't we?
I agree with every word she says about the grading scheme within the
STB. It doesn't represent what guests want, and it is very muddled and
incomprehensible.

I AGREE with Jill Crawshaw's conclusions on her tour of Scotland. I
have stayed in the Station Hotel, Inverness, and everything she stated
about this is absolutely correct.
However, I would like to say that one of the jewels in the crown of
Scotland's tourist industry is Pitlochry. I have stayed in various
hotels there and have had good attention and good food. My sister and I
go for lovely walks during the day and tour the Perthshire countryside.
But the big attraction for us is the theatre in the hills of Pitlochry
where you can see seven plays in seven nights (one is a concert) and we
do at least five. I have done this for the last 25 years and have never
had a disappointing holiday there.
All the staff seem to be professionally trained as we found courtesy
in shops, hotels, and in the theatre itself.

IN your report of the Glasgow Kelvin selection process, you quote
George Galloway's supporters (as ever, too gutless to be quoted by name)
as claiming that they will prevent the reselection process from being
opened.
In other words, their intention is to deny constituency members the
democratic chance of deciding by One Member One Vote (November 2).
Galloway's supporters obviously remember that at the last Hillhead
re-selection their man was defeated by a margin of two to one on One
Member One Vote. Would they instead prefer, say, a bogus referendum, in
which only one name appears on the ballot paper?

MURRAY RITCHIE refers to simmering disputes including legal action
raised by Mrs Ewing over criticism of her voting record (October 30). As
I have not received any writ I cannot comment on the legal action, but
Mrs Ewing's voting history is a matter of public record.
Murray Ritchie's other comment that I and my five Labour colleagues
are contemptuously known as Labour Unionists is one I must admit to
feeling rather proud of. The four main parties which contested the
European elections in 1994 are all unionist.
Looking behind all the rhetoric of the SNP and the claim of
independence in Europe, it is independence within the European Union. It
is logical therefore to assume they believe in the Union and are
therefore unionists.
I am quite happy to be described as a Labour Unionist as Labour is the
party which is leading the debate in Europe. I wonder how Mrs Ewing and
Mr McCartney feel being Nationalist Unionists.

THE Glasgow of the past is dead. The belching volcano that poured fume
and flame to the far corners of this earth is now extinct. There is
nothing to be done. Or can be done. The corpse is decomposing before our
eyes.
The ghost of Glasgow has fled to Asia. To Korea, to Taiwan, to the
sleeping giant now stumbling to its feet -- China.
There the miracles produced by mighty Glasgow are being surpassed by a
human earthquake of energy that is sending shock-waves through Wall
Street and cosy Brussels.
All the dreams of Pat Lally, all the deluge of art, all the bombast
clinging to new-found culture are nothing but a vanity. The glory has
gone.
To build a splendid boulevard to the Clyde, to erect a tower clutching
at the sky, to fling ropes of motorways, like halters of concrete round
the neck of the city, is waste and folly.
Yet a moratorium imposed even by our kennel-bound Secretary of State
would proclaim that all is not lost, and that he is listening as
''wisdom crieth out in the streets''.
The craftsmen who shaped and built the fabric of Glasgow are still
here. But they are despised and forgotten. They are crowded into the
corrals of red-brick flung together at Castlemilk, Easterhouse,
Drumchapel, and the other schemes boasting similar amenities.
They own Glasgow. It is their city. But not for them the architectural
splendours, not for them the Burrell showcase with its #1m per week
upkeep.
To the north of us is a virgin land crying out for people, for new
towns and a new way of life. Within five years our craftsmen could
reshape the Highlands. Glasgow could rebuild for people, not yuppies.
The future beckons. But our leaders are blind.
In the streets I still hear that voice crying out.

IT was with a sinking feeling of recognition that I read Jill
Crawshaw's series of articles on Scottish tourism. Sadly, I have to
agree with her conclusions. Standards that I would not be asked to
accept abroad I find are all too common in Scottish hotels. The charges
here are also out of step with those abroad.
I'd like to make one notable exception to this dismal conclusion: the
facilities and the welcome in Orkney have, in my experience, been very
good.

WHAT a jaundiced view Jill Crawshaw had -- though she did admire our
scenery! I think she was very unfortunate and I think she was wrong to
specially mention hotels. I was glad to note that she liked the Morar
Hotel (the only one) and would like to say the fire was in a lovely
lounge, not a lobby. I've been there.
It is a pity she didn't get to Arran -- I went there for 37 years and
enjoyed every holiday though I took my English husband there with a bit
of trepidation. Thereafter we wanted to go back every year.

I READ Jill Crawshaw's trilogy with great interest and find it
difficult to disagree with her verdict. I do take issue with her on one
matter, however -- well, I would, wouldn't I?
She appears to consider #17 or thereabouts ''a bit steep'' for dinner.
I have scanned through Which Hotel Guide 1996 and in (dare I say?)
England among other parts of Great Britain #20 to #30 is commonplace.
One more observation: book late, or on the day, and you will find the
better places are booked up -- as we were for September.
Jill Crawshaw wondered if perhaps her English accent prompted some of
the rudeness she endured. Not a bit of it -- they're just as rude to
each other, but I still love 'em, and I'm an Englishman. Ah well,
nobody's perfect.

I SPENT 38 years in Canada and was the owner of a medium-sized
manufacturing company there. Now having returned to Scotland, I am
astonished at the views expressed by Mr F McDermid, the ''frequent
visitor to Canada'' (November 3).
His time must have been spent totally within the legislative
provincial assemblies and with politicians, not with average Canadians.
To say that Canadians enjoy having one of the highest tax burdens in the
Western world, along with the highest ratio of civil servants and
politicians per capita of population, is beyond understanding.
In recent years there has been talk of British Columbia, Alberta, and
Newfoundland leaving the Canadian federation.
Unfortunately Canada, mainly because of shortsighted political
ambitions, has focused on the differences within the country, cultural
and geographical, without striving to make itself a proud unified
nation. I trust Scotland will not follow this expensive and shortsighted
path.

WHILE I, and I am sure many others, applaud Alan Dunlop's search for a
coherent vision for the regeneration of Glasgow (October 30), the real
problems lie beyond the vision.
Even if our city fathers were to hold a common vision for the city's
development, the truth is that the mechanisms for delivering the vision
do not exist. A worthwhile vision is of a creative partnership between
the public and private sector in which the aspirations of the community
are both informed and implemented by the entrepreneurial expertise of
the developer.
At present, we have a confrontational planning system which is all
about planning rather than development. One of the consequences is a
grossly under-invested urban fabric.
Instead of apportioning blame for the current mess, the property
industry and politicians alike need to develop new mechanisms for
investing in and planning our town centres.
We need developers, planners, and politicians to plan a coherent way
forward as neither the private sector nor the public sector have all of
the skills required to get this job done. The key is working together in
partnership to anticipate and manage this change.
''Without a vision the people perish'' but without a more positive and
creative attitude the people will never realise the vision!

Music
NOW we know it wasn't a flash in the pan. Joseph Swensen, appointed
last week as principal conductor of the SCO on the basis of one
appearance with the orchestra, produced, at the weekend, some of the
most extraordinary SCO performances of recent times.
When the American conductor takes up his post next year there will be
opportunities to analyse his style, the evident chemistry that exists
between him and the orchestra, and the nature of the musical results,
which, on Saturday night, were astonishing.
James MacMillan's Tryst, first to receive the Swensen treatment, went
off like a racehorse. I've heard the piece many times, but the
blistering pace, scorching drive, and attack with which it leapt off the
page on Saturday brought a fresh shock to the music.
Swensen strode through Tryst as though he's known it for years. Some
of the ensemble playing from the SCO was unbelievably cohesive. The
conductor's sense of rhythmic definition, articulation, and sheer
propulsiveness (three of his trademarks, I suspect) made it quiver with
electricity. Edge of the seat stuff.
Similarly with Mozart's Piano Concerto in G, K453, lucidly played by
Imogen Cooper (another of these underrated British pianists whose
hallmark is unshowy intelligence) with Swensen bringing to the
concerto's eccentric finale not just sense, but a rare anarchic wit.
Above all, Swensen, who gives a performance with his entire body, is
an animateur, releasing the orchestra and the music. And in a
mesmerising account of Richard Strauss's Metamorphosen -- with the
conductor appearing physically battered by the music -- the SCO produced
for him playing that moved through intensity to seething rage and utter
grief. It left me speechless.

Opera
INTENTIONALLY or otherwise, a collision of emotional extremes marked
the UK premiere, on Friday night, of Gavin Bryars's five-act opera,
Medea, given at the Tramway by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra as
part of the BBC's Fairest Isle -- a year-long celebration of British
culture -- and, at the same time, the first concert in the SSO's Cutting
Edge series.
The fact that the bulk of Bryars's first opera is set in Greek
automatically lends the work an air of detachment -- in much the same
way that Stravinsky's use of Latin gives an objective quality to his
sacred music for the opera Oedipus Rex.
In Medea, that intrinsic quality is emphasised by Bryars's depiction
of the wronged and betrayed eponyomous ''heroine'', not as a vengeful
hysteric, but as supercool, almost dislocated from all around her,
following her own line of reasoning and calculation.
But what threw all of that into even more stark relief on Friday was
that this was a stand-up-and-sing concert performance, enhanced by
atmospheric lighting, but otherwise without an iota of theatricality. In
other words, there was absolutely no physical drama to the performance.
Crashing headlong into this detached objectivity was the music itself,
hour after hour of sumptuous, tonally gorgeous music. This music,
despite the pulsing minimalist nature of much of it, is saturated with a
sensuous romanticism that derives directly from the most voluptuous
music of Richard Strauss. The vocal lines, endlessly soaring, were of an
unremitting lyrical and emotional intensity.
The collision between the two poles -- absolute detachment and the
most intimate subjectivity -- produced a tension that was so
intoxicating it was almost tangible.
The stunningly beautiful music was ravishingly sung by a superb cast,
including Majella Cullagh in the title role, with Patricia Bardon (the
Nurse), Gidon Saks (the Tutor), Richard Halton (Jason), Nicholas Folwell
(Aegeus), and David Barrell (the Messenger). Conductor Martyn Brabbins
stirred a rich brew from the Scottish Opera Chorus and the BBC SSO with
their dark strings (no violins) augmented by saxes and a platoon of
glittering percussion.

Dance
IN the midst of a lyrical, waltzy duet, he suddenly cartwheels over
her extending leg. Couples, close-knit on the floor will smoothly lock
together, swiftly flip over like a human Swiss roll, and emerge in a
hug. We're talking head-over-heels romance here and among the hearts and
flowers swoosh of lithe bodies in Roses, there's a playfulness which
reminds us that Paul Taylor is a master conjuror of moods and movements.
Taylor understands shadows: the edge of bathos that threatens every
tragic moment with a killer-diller pratfall, that tendril of darkness
that snakes into paradise scenarios. Like a painter, he mixes in moments
of contrary colour, to heighten the primary effect of a piece. In a
hectic work like Syzygy (to music by Donald York), the contrast arrives
in the serenity of Mary Cochran, poised like some enchanted Greek
nymph-turned-planet, while others orbit around her before resuming their
gorgeous, headlong flights of electric t'ai chi.
Dating from 1956, 3 Epitaphs works its spell of making audiences
laugh, but pause, at the lolloping figures in drab mufti who mooch
around to the sad partings of New Orleans funeral marches, the littlest
one tagging onto the tallest in dogged adoration. Like Funny Papers
which so cleverly picks up on cartoon characteristics, 3 Epitaphs has
you thinking about what you laugh at and why. What you applaud
unstintingly, however, is not only Taylor's ongoing creativity on this
40th anniversary tour, but the buoyancy and precision of his dancers who
radiate freshness, humour, and a musicality that is so in spirit with
the choreography.
A sadly brief stopover in Edinburgh.

A DEMANDING, but rewarding, exhibition Scenes of the World To Come,
has just opened at Edinburgh's City Art Centre. Demanding because by the
very nature of its subject, it is composed mainly of architectural
drawings -- though these are mostly accessible to a lay viewer -- and
glass cases full of illustrated books and magazines, often Russian;
evidence of a debate rather than the debate itself.
There are items of great value or interest, sometimes unnerving, like
the great totalitarian schemes for palaces of Russian communism,
sometimes of great historical interest (Sant'Elia's original manifesto
of futurist architecture), sometimes aesthetically fascinating or
revealing, like the work by Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe's extraordinary
drawing for an unbuilt project for Berlin, or the large model for Loos'
proposal for the Chicago Tribune building. (Much of the material
consists of entries for architectural competitions).
Still, one looks to Jean-Louis Cohen's accompanying book/catalogue for
the full story. Cohen re-examines the relations between European
architects and American architecture -- including plain American
building -- the practical, technology and capital driven,
anti-architecture of American factories and silos, an art brut of
architecture.
America acquired a dual role: it was both a real New World of
impressive energy, unfettered by history, unconsciously acting out the
Futurist theories of the Old World, especially through its skyscrapers,
and a blueprint for a possible Europe.
Hence the title. What is rewarding about the show is the way it
invites us to dream new worlds, as architects do -- and (it is also
clear) as do dictators, whether fascist or communist. An historial
exhibition (1893-1960) of schemes for a Europe re-imagined through
America provides a fascinating mixture of science fiction and often
bitter history.
In this vital chapter in the great unwritten history of architecture
and vertigo, how small the human figure. Let us hope such futures are
behind us now.

A new circle of friends make life bearable for single mother JEAN
SANDISON
ONE of the most difficult aspects of being a single parent is getting
out and meeting people. It is a lot easier said than done. My daughter
Jessica attends two play groups and the majority of women I see there
are married and financially secure; at least they seem to be, according
to how they and their children look and dress, and of course, the
inevitable VW Golf GTi.
I smile and say ''hello'', but it doesn't get much further. This is
not meant as a criticism, after all we have little in common, other than
being mothers. The nuclear-family mum perhaps instinctively shies away
from a single parent, living hand-to-mouth on social security. The
single parent represents a break with the established, centuries-old
traditions of family life.
When I moved to Inverness one year ago, I was determined to make new
friends, to develop new interests and become involved in useful social
affairs; to be a more responsible member of society, not only for my own
benefit, but also for the benefit of my two-and-a-half-year-old. I have
been successful in these matters, and, happily now, in my friends.
Living on #70 a week doesn't make meeting people or socialising easy.
Babysitters cost money and, frankly, I can't afford them. Six weeks ago,
however, I met my neighbours -- three girls, all about the same age as
me, unmarried, and without children. Caroline and Heather are veterinary
surgery nurses and Linda is at Inverness College.
To begin with, it was wonderful. I had new friends with similar
interests who called regularly for a chat and a cup of coffee, and it
really took the pressure off my daily routine with Jessica. But if they
decided to go out -- to the cinema, for a meal, or across to our local
for a drink, they simply picked up their coats, locked the door and were
off. The evening was their oyster.
For me, the process of going out is more complicated and requires
careful, advanced planning. Saving up for a babysitter, getting Jessica
quietly and happily to bed, then escaping without trauma. Before I close
my front door, the evening has already cost me anything between #10-#20,
and when I'm out it is hard to relax, clock-watching for curfew time.
But despite the occasional pang of envy, I love my new friends to
bits. They are always supportive, telling me that, as far as Jessica is
concerned I am doing a super job; encouraging me in my career prospects,
listening patiently to my problems and, at times, taking severe
brain-damage about my life in general and the problems of being a single
mum in particular.
They also look after one of my most important needs: the need to get
out for that life-saving bottle of Becks once in a while. We are lucky
in that we live only a few yards apart, and even more fortunate that the
Heathermount, a lively, friendly pub, is but a step away. Linda
babysits, free of charge, and Heather and Caroline frog-march me across
the road for a short dose of Becks and sanity.
And it is not only that, because whenever I am in a sticky position
and the purse is bare, they help out. A few days ago, I had to attend an
evening meeting but could not afford a babysitter. Heather did not
hesitate, even after a hard day at the surgery, and stepped in to do
battle with my little lady for a few hours. Or when I was a day late to
pay the milkman, Caroline was in her purse before I could say ''thank
you''. I don't think they will ever realise the difference their
friendship has made to my life.
Jessica is also greatly taken with our new friends and treats their
homes as if they were her own. In other words, less than delicately.
Caroline invited us over for coffee the other evening and within seconds
Jessica had her washing out and was doing it again, the carpet was
littered with biscuit crumbs, and the cat was clinging, terrified, to
the lamp shade.
The trials and tribulations of being a single parent are still all
around me, the loneliness, financial hardship, unspoken and spoken
criticism, the day-to-day grind of trying to make ends meet, but my
friends have made my life much happier and more rewarding. It is a lot
easier to cope and I never take my friends for granted. And Jessica is
delighted, after all, four mothers for the price of one is pretty good
business.

CREATURES of fearful symmetry evolve before your very eyes. Now you
see them, now you don't. Flat, but with an eerie three-dimensional
quality is the infinite universe of M C Escher.
This is not magic eye, but a series of restless, confusing yet ordered
illusions. Diamonds at first sight, on closer inspection they are
interlocking metal rings, the ribbons entwining them are slithering
snakes -- The M C Escher Sticker Book is smarter than your average
album.
Where animals lurk, they are cold-blooded. The men without women (no
flowers, no females) are fey, dubious-looking gargoyles and gnomes.
Once your mind has been blown by this Pandora's box of whirry moths
and changeling bats, apply yourself to the therapeutic pages of The M C
Escher Colouring Book. An antidote to stress, it has an inspired jigsaw
of lines on every page with a folded poster in the middle -- a colouring
book for all ages.
Colouring in Escher's could prove so absorbing and addictive as to
become the executive toy of the late nineties.
The pieces of tessellation sit perfectly, but everything doesn't add
up. The biographical notes are quite at odds with the mysterious and
often disturbing creativity of M C Escher.
Maurits Cornelis Escher was born in Holland in 1898, the youngest son
of an engineer. His father encouraged Mauk, as he was known to family
and friends, to take up craft skills. An art teacher taught him to make
linocuts. In time he enrolled at the School of Architecture and
Decorative Arts in Haarlem. However Mauk preferred drawing and graphic
art.
His studies completed, he went to Italy, married and the couple had
three sons. He moved back to the Netherlands in 1941.
So far, so cosy, there is nothing supernatural there. Escher died in
1972, none of which explains the grey area which is the psychological
aspect of his illustrations.

Jennifer Cunningham meets the queen of mirth with the village hall
touch
THE Queen of Kettleland had something to say: ''People don't believe
it is a real place, they think it is kind of mystical.'' The ''Queen''
is Cilla Fisher and we were where thousands of children long to be, in
Kettle. There was the sign on the wall to prove it: Kettle Primary
School.
''Let's put the kettle on,'' she says without a trace of irony,
because when Cilla hits home after touring with the show, she turns into
a mum.
Her 10-year-old son James is at school just over the wall from their
new house in Kingskettle. When she needs inspiration for a new rhyme,
she looks out of her office window and watches the latest games in the
playground.
Cilla, husband Artie Trezise and multi-instrument musician Gary
Coupland have quietly taken Scotland -- and much of the rest of the
world -- by storm. Over the past 12 years their children's show, the
Singing Kettle, has bounced from village hall frolics to mega business.
That they have never lost the village hall touch, is the key to their
success. With James and their 22-year-old daughter Jane they have always
had instant and candid critics. It was Jane, now part of the show, who
was the original inspiration for much of the material as her parents
sang and made up rhymes and jokes to amuse her during car journeys to
and from their folk-singing gigs. Then they began again with James, who
enjoys a vast range of music from rock to classical, but is still a
useful sounding board for his parents. ''It's like The Old Grey Whistle
Test, if I hear him humming something a few days after we've tried it,
it passes,'' says Cilla.
With an audience of 61,500 for last year's three-week run of the
Christmas show, the Singing Kettle outsold Wet Wet Wet, Dire Straits and
Take That. They hold the record at the SECC, where their Christmas show
now lasts three and a half weeks. The summer show tours round Scotland
and, true to their roots, they visit the smaller towns and villages in
October.
There has been a gradual shift in audience composition to more fathers
and grandparents rather than mum with a string of the neighbourhood
kids. As a parent who has been subjected to her share of dire
entertainment for children, Cilla says: ''It is because we are tolerable
entertainment for adults. It's bright, it's colourful, it's not smutty,
there are no innuendoes and musically it is good.''
Folk music was the family entertainment at the Fisher home in Glasgow
during Cilla's childhood. ''It was mainly Ray and Archie and all their
friends who were the source of the music which ranged from American to
Scottish folk music. Every weekend, there were concerts in with the
Dubliners or Pete Seeger or Ravi Shankar from the time I was about
seven. It was always party time.''
In time, Archie and Ray were joined by Cilla and there was a Fisher
family album with the other siblings. After Cilla and Artie Trezise met,
at a folk concert, they formed a new duo, from which today's Singing
Kettle evolved naturally. Cilla explains it in terms of technique:
''There has always been a closer contact with your audience on the folk
circuit than in a rock concert, where you are down there and the
performers are up on stage.
''We had to encourage adults to sing for about 15 years -- half of
them were drunk at the time, or some of them would not like you, or
whatever. That's where the communication came from. We don't patronise
kids, it is a nice, open feeling. The children actually like us as
people and try to make contact with us,'' she says.
Although they were part of an educational offshoot from the Edinburgh
Folk Festival many years ago, Cilla's intention was never more than to
entertain children in a way which would allow them to enjoy live music
and learn to be an audience.
''Children are the most uninhibited audience you will ever play to. If
they love you they'll tell you, and if they hate you, they'll certainly
tell you. Not many of them have got up and walked away, but if they
don't like something, they won't tolerate it. Any kind of singing and
dancing for two hours is going to be tiring, but to me it is a charm to
do. I couldn't imagine doing anything else. It is an escape, like going
into a picture book, because whatever you were feeling or thinking about
before disappears and by the end your mind is winding down, so you think
about things in a different way.''
They moved to Kingskettle nearly 20 years ago, when Jane was a toddler
and Artie was a teacher of economics and business studies in Kirkcaldy.
He was raised along the road in Cupar and an aunt was selling a house in
Kettle. ''It was too small for us with a small child, but my mother
moved in and then the flat upstairs came on the market,'' says Cilla,
explaining the genesis of the perfect childcare arrangement which
allowed them to go on folk-singing tours and still holds good when the
Kettle shows take to the road.
The Singing Kettle would not be where they are today without Cilla's
mum. Cilla's father died when she was five, leaving her mother with
seven children between the ages of five and 18. She now has ''hundreds
of grandchildren and great-grandchildren,'' but clearly a special
relationship with her youngest child, who remembers: ''She always just
went wherever she was needed, especially when anyone was having a
baby.''
There's now a Singing Kettle shop in Kingskettle, to which their more
determined fans beat a path from unlikely corners of the globe. The
phenomenon grew by popular demand, according to Cilla. Television shows
led to records and tapes followed by a demand for T-shirts and kettle
earrings from people who had been to the shows. ''We certainly didn't
sit down and say we were going to build an empire for children. I am not
very interested in the product side and I don't think Artie is either,''
she says, and it is not difficult to believe her.
She's anxious to get back to the rhymes she left on the computer. ''I
never thought I would write so much or research material. I love doing
that. I've now got a strange feeling that I am Roald Dahl because I
really enjoy writing crazy things, perhaps for slightly older children.
''It will always be recognisably Scottish to people from elsewhere,
but I write in English and I don't particularly try to incorporate Scots
words. We started by singing 'Katie Bairdie had a coo', but the Scottish
element was ironed out a bit when we went into television.''
The phenomenon works all over the world, even in front of immaculate
rows of Chinese children in Hong Kong or cynical dads at home: at least
one bright young executive's colleagues, regularly subjected to ''yo ho
ho'' in the office, will testify to the catchiness of the rhymes.

THe Scottish Rugby Union has placed a revised set of contract
proposals before the international squad and expect to hear back from
players' representatives Rob Wainwright and Craig Chalmers today.
The Herald understands that the global sum being talked about is still
in the region of #22,000-plus but there has been some modification as to
how the money, which is for the Test against Western Samoa and
Scotland's four matches in the Five Nations' tournament, will be made up
with regard to bonuses and so on.
The Union's lead negotiator, senior vice-president Fred McLeod, said
last night: ''We have put further proposals to the players and I am
reasonably confident that we can have a contract in place in time for
the Western Samoa game on November 18.
''There are some areas which I am not happy with, such as insurance
aspects, of what is, essentially, a contract of employment, but I am
confident that we can work it out,'' he said.
The new professional relationship between the SRU and the
international squad is also expected to include medical personnel and
there is also a hint that coaches could be included in the new deal.
* DAMIAN Cronin, currently playing his rugby with Bourges in France,
was in Edinburgh yesterday for a Scotland squad session. The Scotland
lock indicated that a return to the UK could be on the cards, possibly
with London Scottish who, it was reported at the weekend, are interested
in playing in the Scottish Cup competition next season.
* JONATHAN Davies returned to rugby union yesterday following an
#80,000 move from Warrington and admitted he felt ''rather alien'' back
in the 15-a-side game.
Davies, 33, was the last of the supremely-gifted Wales stand-offs and
his move to rugby league contributed to the worst spell in the
Principality's union history.
Now he is back, there is no guarantee he help Wales return to the
glory days but he proved he has the artistry to entertain crowds and
influence matches.
Only 7000 turned up -- exactly half the capacity -- but three times
the gate that watched Cardiff play Aberavon in last season's cup
quarter-final.
And it was a winning start for Davies as he contributed a couple of
scoring passes in Cardiff's 57-9 success.
''I was very nervous at the start,'' he said. ''The public pressure
has been incredible. I just wanted to come through unscathed.
''It was very difficult coming back. I took a long while to adjust
because rugby union is less continuous than the other game.
''It was very strange to have players spread across the field and the
possession was a bit stagnant. A lot of players were spoiling rather
than being constructive.
''But I want to contribute to Cardiff as much as I can and everybody
is in the fight for the first-team jersey, with all the backs from
stand-off to full back being internationals.''
Davies was involved around 16 times during the 80 minutes although his
first two touches -- a sliced kick and a loose pass -- were awful.
Most of his further efforts were productive but he hit Aberavon wing
Simon Hutchinson with a high tackle and he also missed one tackle
completely -- but Welsh stand-offs have never really been Andrew-type
tackling machines.
* WASPS and West Hartlepool look certain to replay Saturday's
abandoned Courage League encounter at Repton Avenue. The game was halted
12 minutes from time when a spectator suffered a heart attack and was
rushed to hospital, with West's Scotland international captain Rob
Wainwright leading the initial effort that was to ultimately help save
the man's life.
Meanwhile, at the top of the table, both Bath and Leicester won
testing away matches. Bath beat Sale 30-18 while Leicester defeated
Harlequins 29-25. Gloucester lost to Saracens while Bristol defeated
Orrell.

SENIOR Labour Party officials are expected to decide today or tomorrow
whether to prevent a Paisley North constituency meeting after
allegations of malpractice.
It has been suggested that Paisley North MP Irene Adams, who has waged
a campaign against drug dealers in the constituency, may use
parliamentary privilege to expose further corruption in the area if
serious attempts to deselect her emerge at the general management
committee meeting on Wednesday.
However, senior party sources have pledged their ''full backing'' to
ensure the MP is not ''disadvantaged'' in an attempt to avoid a
''potentially very stressful reselection battle''. Mrs Adams suffered a
stroke in the late summer.
The selection battles in Paisley North and the neighbouring Renfrew
West and Inverclyde have been made necessary because of boundary
changes. Mrs Adams replaced her late husband, Allen, in the seat after
winning a by-election in 1990.
Concern has been expressed locally that the MP's reselection may not
have been the formality most people expected, given that her political
rivals appear to have packed the constituency.
Sources said Mrs Adams might be prepared to resign and force a
by-election and, if pressed, might cite the names of party activists
with alleged drug connections in the House of Commons.
Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, has
confirmed that he received several complaints about the conduct at some
of the five branches of the Paisley North constituency. He said senior
party officials would examine the evidence before Wednesday and a ruling
would be announced before then.
Mr McConnell said yesterday: ''If there has been any abuse, we will
act immediately to protect the representation of the party and the
Member of Parliament.''
Earlier this year, the Scottish Labour Party investigated alleged
membership irregularities at the branches of Paisley North and the
neighbouring Renfrew West and Inverclyde constituency of Labour MP Tommy
Graham. A report was sent to the national executive committee at
Labour's headquarters in London on Friday.
Labour activity in three Renfrewshire constituencies -- Paisley North,
Paisley South, and Renfrew West and Inverclyde -- was suspended over the
summer after allegations of vote-rigging and links to FB Security, a
local security company.
Under the proposed boundary changes, the Linwood ward of Mr Graham's
seat is to be joined to Paisley North. This would entitle him to
challenge Mrs Adams, but Mr Graham said yesterday he had no intention of
standing in the constituency.
He said he would seek the nomination for the new West Renfrewshire
seat, which takes in his own constituency, where it has been forecast
that he could face a serious challenge.
The Herald understands that the three main challengers for Mr Graham's
redrawn seat would be Mr Douglas Alexander who fought the Perth and
Kinross by-election; Mr Ian Smart, a Cumbernauld solicitor; and Mr Brian
Oldery, a former official with the public services union Unison and a
leading member of the new Renfrewshire unitary authority.
Asked about the challengers, Mr Graham said: ''It is the democratic
right of party members to stand against a sitting MP. It seems to be the
in-thing.''

SCOTLAND achieved a record fifth win in the Hong Kong Classic pairs
when Kenny Logan and Alex Marshall, who only qualified for the knockout
stages by the skin of their teeth, edged out a South African pairing by
19-18 in yesterday's final.
Victory was clinched on the dramatic final end, when skip Marshall
picked up the necessary two shots with the last bowl of the match.
The Scots' victory over Neil Burkett and Danny Piketh -- which
followed successes in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1990 -- came after they only
finished fourth in their preliminary group.
''We had to win our last two group matches against Wales and Ireland
to qualify, and we did that. We just took it from there,'' admitted
Marshall.
The Scots reached the quarter-final stages when they beat New
Zealand's Peter Belliss and Andrew Curtain 20-18 in their final section
match on Saturday morning, and then added a 19-10 win over the
previously unbeaten Channel Island pair of Adrian Welch and David Le
Marquand.
Next in line for the Scots was Phil Rowlands and Robbie Price from
Wales, when a devasting opening burst gave the Scots an 18-2 lead after
11 ends, and they went on to a 24-10 victory.
Scotland's final opponents, South Africa, had already scored a section
win over the Scots and, when they opened up a 14-10 lead at the close of
the fourteenth end, it looked as if the Scots might have to settle for
second best again.
However, four shots on the next end, followed by two more on the next,
gave Logan and Marshall a 16-14 lead, but South Africa hit back to tie
things up at 17-17 with two ends to play.
On the twentieth, Burkett twice killed the end with the Scots lying
and then, on the third replay, dealt a real body blow. With Scotland
lying four, Burkett's last-bowl drive was off target, but he fluked the
shot to take an 18-17 lead into the last.
''I felt then that perhaps it wasn't going to be our day, but it all
came right in the final reckoning,'' Marshall said later.
The Scots skip produced two devastating bowls to win the match. With
South Africa lying, Marshall drove with his penultimate bowl and forced
the holding shots off the green.
Burkett then failed with his last bowl draw dropping short and
Marshall then added the match-winning second with the last bowl of the
final.
''Alex is the best skip I've ever played with -- he was tremendous
during the early part of the week, and even better today,'' said Logan.
Results:
Quarter-finals -- South Africa (D Picketh and N Burkett) 26, Kowloon
Bowls Club (A Pointon and N Kennedy) 14; Hong Kong (W McMahon and D Tso)
24, Zimbabwe (T Dale and M McCormick) 21; Wales (P Rowlands and R Price)

GOLF: ALFRED DUNHILL MASTERS
WELSHMAN Ian Woosnam felt the heat again yesterday -- and not only
from the weather -- as up-and-coming New Zealand golfer Michael Campbell
took his first title with a record-equalling final round to win the
$400,000 Alfred Dunhill Masters.
The 26-year-old Campbell played textbook golf to equal the course
record of 65 which, together with joint second-placed Australian Craig
Parry, he had set on Friday at the par-72 Emeralda Golf and Country Club
course on the outskirts of Jakarta.
Campbell, who was third in the Open, and won $72,000 yesterday,
finished 21 under par with 267 to win by five strokes from Parry and
strong finisher Mark Mouland of Britain.
His round included seven birdies and an eagle and he completed the
final nine in just 30 shots. He sealed victory with an eagle on the
par-5 sixteenth when he hit a No.3-wood to within 10ft of the pin for
his his second, then slotted the putt. Parry's round of 69 was erratic
and included two eagles and three bogeys. Mouland's 66 had eight
birdies.
Pre-tournament favourite and former world No.1 Woosnam had a bad day,
bogeying four holes, including a double bogey at the sixteenth, to give
him a total of 284 and a share of twenty-seventh place.
The heat of the first two days, which Woosnam had described as
unbearable, returned for the final day and appeared to affect the
Welshman's game.
''I am still having trouble with my driving and need to work on
that,'' said Woosnam, who hit 77 yesterday.

A SCOTTISH doctor is helping to spearhead an international
''swat-team'' of experts fighting new and re-emerging diseases around
the world.
Dr Lindsay Martinez is a member of a new rapid-response unit set up by
the World Health Organisation to counter the threat.
Dr Martinez, who comes from Glasgow and is now based in Geneva,
Switzerland, helps plan future strategy for the unit's 30-member team of
scientists and technical staff.
Epidemics of disease were expected to become more frequent in the wake
of poverty and overcrowding, she warned.
The rapid-response unit was established this month in reaction to a
string of worrying epidemics -- ebola in Africa, plague in India, dengue
and cholera in Latin America, diphtheria in the former Soviet Union, and
tuberculosis.
The latest threat emerged over the weekend in Nicaragua, where an
unknown disease has led to 15 deaths.
The rapid-response unit was a departure from the WHO's usual work, she
said. ''The traditional activities of the WHO are more in the area of
long-term strengthening as opposed to direct action and immediate
intervention.''

GRAEME Obree, Scotland's world pursuit champion, failed in his bid to
break two national records during yesterday's British Cycling Federation
international meeting at Manchester Velodrome.
Obree, whose own pursuit speciality was not included in the six-nation
team competition, could not overcome a slow start and clocked 5mins
36.488secs for a standing start 5km, falling more than a second short of
the record set by Colin Sturgess in Stuttgart in 1991.
And Obree's time of 1min 2.225sec for a flying kilometre was more than
three seconds outside Shaun Wallace's 1986 record set in Colorado.
Sylvain Anquetil, nephew of former Tour de France great, Jacques, and
Sebastien Morelon, son of former Olympic and world sprint champion,
Daniel, were among the winners as France took the team title. Denmark
were second, Holland third, and Britain fourth.
Best of the British riders was Commonwealth Games silver medallist
Chris Newton, who was second to Denmark's Michael Sandstod in a 10km
points race, and was placed third behind Sandstod and France's Samuel
Renaux in a scratch race over the same distance.
Jan-Dirk van Hameren of Holland repeated his win of a year ago in the
Keirin event in which riders are paced by a motorcycle until a final
sprint for the line. British champion Steve Paulding, riding for
Scotland, finished fourth.

COMEDY actor Paul Eddington, who approached death with the kind of
quiet dignity that he brought to a long and distinguished acting career,
has died aged 68.
News of his death, on Saturday evening, was announced last night by
Lady Caroline Marshall, wife of Sir Michael Marshall, the Conservative
MP for Arundel. The couple were close family friends of Mr Eddington.
Tall and debonair, he shot to fame as the long-suffering Gerry
Leadbetter in TV's The Good Life. He was the husband of snooty Penelope
Keith and neighbour of Felicity Kendal and his long-time actor friend
Richard Briers, the couple who went self-sufficient.
Eddington went on to international fame as the all too believably
incompetent politician Jim Hacker in the satirical double series Yes,
Minister and Yes, Prime Minister.
One of its biggest fans was the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
and he was made a CBE in 1987 in recognition of his efforts in keeping
the nation amused. But he once said that Mrs Thatcher was not one of his
favourite people.
Beneath the smiles and the elegance, he was secretly nursing serious
health problems. He was diabetic, and for 40 years suffered from a rare
form of skin cancer, mycosis fungoides, which finally left him covered
from head to foot in dark blotches and sores. He also lost his hair as a
result of radiotherapy.
The disease restricted his later appearances and in 1994, when he
performed alongside Briers in the stage play Home, about two elderly men
in a mental hospital, a provincial tour was planned around hospitals
where his treatment could continue.
But he pulled through and the play later had a successful run at
Wyndham's Theatre in the West End to critical acclaim.
He commented: ''It's a thorough nuisance but the treatment slows down
the condition to such an extent that there's a very good chance of my
dying of something else.''
When he launched his autobiography, So Far, So Good, published just
two weeks ago, Eddington spoke movingly, bravely, and with good humour
of his illness.
''There's a stigma attached to one's appearance,'' he said. ''People
are reluctant to shake hands with you if they see you festering, and you
can understand it.
''I haven't had a great deal of television exposure looking as I do.
I'm hoping now to be famous for being grotesque instead of famous for
being a good actor.
''I look in the mirror every morning and it gives me a bit of a
fright. And I am discovering a way of coping with the caring look that
comes into people's eyes when you say you've got a touch of cancer.''
Eddington spent his early childhood in north London. His father's
family were Quakers and his mother's Catholic. Their marriage was not
happy and they separated when he was in his early teens.
The young Paul Eddington was sent to a Quaker boarding school. After
gaining no qualifications, he took a job as a window dresser in a
department store.
He was 17 when he decided he wanted to be an actor and, during the
Second World War, joined Ensa (Entertainments National Service
Association), playing troops concerts.
After the war, he joined Birmingham Repertory Company and went on to
work with other repertory companies, including Sheffield, where he met
his wife, Patricia Scott, whom he married in 1952. They had four
children.

Attempts to bring attitudes towards single parents into the nineties,
says Sue Innes, are only part of the solution to a long-running source
of maternal anxiety.
THE name changes say it all really. In the 1940s it was the Scottish
Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child, with the unfortunate
acronym SCUM. It was renamed the Council for Single Parents in 1973, and
has now, following its recent fiftieth anniversary, become One-Parent
Families, Scotland.
From a group defined by its exception from the married norm, the
inclusiveness of ''families'' is now emphasised. It reflects a change
from the charitable approach of the professional helping the needy, to
one in which single parents are seen as the experts on their needs and
how to meet them.
Conferences run by the organisation also show this shift: in 1954 one
was held on ''The Unmarried Mother of Low Mentality'', a phrase not even
John Redwood could use in public now; in 1968, ''Fatherless Families: Do
we meet their needs?''; but by 1980, ''Single-Parent Priorities -- a
Better Life for Our Children''.
The issues they've campaigned on have not changed as much. ''Although
the position of lone parents has improved greatly in 50 years, some
attitudes remain all too familiar,'' director Sue Robertson comments.
This was reflected in the theme for the fiftieth annual conference,
''From Moral Welfare to Moral Panic'' held last week.
Housing, which has been the front-running policy concern for most of
the past 50 years, is more of a problem now because of the diminished
stock of social housing and rising rent costs.
In the 1940s and 1950s the council had close links with mother and
baby homes and adoption agencies. Now adoption of babies is unusual:
fewer than 100 babies a year are adopted in Scotland, whereas in 1945
and 1965 there were almost 2000 adoptions, most of them likely to have
been babies.
The figures do not reveal the marital status of the mothers. Even in
1970, when premarital sex was no longer so shameful that the evidence
had to be concealed, around one-quarter of babies born to single mothers
were placed for adoption. In a paper given to a conference that year,
there is chilling discussion of whether it's advisable for a mother who
plans adoption to see her baby after birth.
The number of babies available for adoption went into steep decline at
the same time as the social stigma against unmarried mothers eased,
which tells us something about how genuine a choice that was -- as do
women's own accounts. This has not stopped the renewed proposal of
adoption as an alternative to state benefits for young, unmarried
mothers.
Now there are only a handful of mother and baby homes, mainly church
connected. Supported, but more independent, accommodation is provided
through the Walpole Housing Association, one of several now separate
organisations set up by the Scottish Council for Single Parents, and by
some social work departments, but the focus is now on helping vulnerable
single mothers keep their children.
A crucial campaigning issue in the 1970s was the right to retain a
tenancy or stay in the marital home after separation, leading to changes
in council practice and legal change in 1981.
A campaign over the legal rights of ''illegitimate'' children began as
far back as 1918, succeeding in 1986 when legal discrimination against
them was removed and the term itself abolished. In the 1970s and
eighties the moral distinction drawn between unmarried mothers and those
who were on their own because of separation and divorce faded, although
widows are still treated differently.
In the early years of this century there was intense political debate
over how far the state should intervene in child welfare, prompted by
very high levels of infant mortality -- a rate which was twice as high
for the babies of unmarried women. Interestingly, feminist campaigners
for Family Allowances -- first called Maternal Endowments -- excluded
unmarried mothers.
Recent research by Professor Jane Lewis at the London School of
Economics documents ''pendulum swings'' in attitudes and policy. Whereas
since the Child Support Act the main direction of contemporary policy is
to make separated fathers financially support children, she comments
that the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act opposed any claim by an unmarried
mother for financial support from the father as this would only
encourage female immorality.
Shifts in the state's treatment of lone-mother families, she argues,
mirror ''changes in patterns of sexual morality and views of marriage''.
So, for example, the Finer Report's liberal recommendations in 1974
followed change (in England and Wales) to the divorce law, abandoning
the idea of fault, after which no distinction could be made between
''guilty'' and ''innocent'' ex-wives.
In contrast, she quotes 1920s arguments that support for unmarried
mothers would only ''stimulate illegitimacy'' -- an idea recently
revived by American sociologist Charles Murray. At the time the eugenic
movement was concerned that children of unmarried mothers were more
likely to become criminals. Again there are recent echoes, though not as
yet a repetition of the theme that getting pregnant outside marriage was
evidence that they were ''mentally unfit''. She also quotes the case of
a ''home alone'' widow in 1914, fined for leaving her three children
alone while she went to work to support them.
In the early 1970s, Margaret Bramall, then director of the National
Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child, told a conference in
Scotland that unmarried mothers were seen as ''a challenge to society,
to our accepted ethical and religious concepts, and to the institution
of marriage itself''.
In 1970, one in 12 births was to a lone mother, as opposed to one in
three now (though a high proportion are living with a partner). A 1970
study for the Scottish Home and Health Department concluded that single
mothers are not different from married mothers. They range from
''impulsive and carefree'' to ''self-critical and guilt-ridden'', their
relationships to the baby's father ranges from casual to the long-term,
and they were as likely to come from happy homes as unhappy.
The problems listed were stereotyping, accommodation, and the chance
to live apart from her own family; and conversely social isolation, lack
of daycare and after-school care, low wages, and dependence on
Supplementary Benefit. Practical problems were exacerbated by ''hostile
social attitudes''. Talk to single mothers today and they'll tell you
much the same thing.
Sue Robertson says ruefully that she's been saying much the same
things for 10 years, since she took the job. ''You see these
long-running myths like girls getting pregnant to jump the housing
queue, and living on benefit with no intention of working. The main
difference I've seen is how cutbacks have affected single parents,
mainly cutbacks in childcare and social security.''
The loss, in 1988, of most grants for household equipment and of the
childcare allowance in Supplementary Benefit, plus the replacement of a
tapered earnings disregard in favour of the formula sum of #15, has made
life harder for single parents, as have changes to how housing benefit
is calculated.
The key issues have stayed similar: the poverty trap, affordable
childcare, how to finance going to college, and housing. Sue Robertson
flips through the record of inquiries that month -- most are looking to
be put in touch with single-parent groups, or ask questions about
maintenance, the CSA, a violent partner, childcare, or money.
However, she also notices a real change in attitudes among single
parents themselves. Probably very few actively choose their situation,
despite current mythology. But ''there are a lot of people who say they
like being single parents and they're getting on fine'', and her
organisation was taken to task last year by members for failing
sufficiently to emphasise the positive dimension.
''It's a viable way to live and bring up children, and they want it to
be recognised as such.''
The focus is now on helping single mothers keep their children

ANY Wonderstuff fans wondering as to the health of their one-time
front man, Miles Hunt, could take some comfort from his new band, Vent.
Hunt has rediscovered the aggression and enthusiasm lacking in his last
appearance at the same venue. Vent's chances would, however, increase
still further if he were to retrieve songwriting deftness of touch for
which he was previously known.
Therapy? share Hunt's three-piece format, but exude a confidence and
tightness that can only have come from a year of solid touring. From the
opening Infernal Love, it is apparent that this is a band whose onstage
chemistry elevates their performance beyond the level of their mediocre
recorded output.
However, Saturday's set, for all its power, did little to erase the
nagging doubts. Its best moments came in the form of the carefully
selected cover versions (Joy Division's Isolation and Husker Du's Diane)
and the singles Going Nowhere, Stories, and Teethgrinder.
Nevertheless, these along with the rest of the set epitomise a
songwriting rut, which makes it for the most part formulaic and
uninspiring. While Therapy? enjoy the benefits of being a three-piece,
they suffer more than most from the limitations imposed by the genre.
Even their attempts to overcome this by employing a cellist on some
songs is negated by the low prominence he is given in the sound-mix.
It is left to wonder whether Therapy's continuing appeal is down to
their ability to be all things to all people. Their audience now
embraces punk, grunge, goth, and metal fans. Wilful eclectisism or a
band forced in new directions by their record company? Solid but
stagnant, Therapy? receive that open verdict.

IT was some night at the Mike Biggar dinner at Murrayfield on Friday,
and Mike was able to benefit to the tune of sixty-odd thousand, which is
good. I find now that no-one talks to me on these evenings in case it
slips into these pages. ''See if we let slip a few things here, would
you mention them?'' asked Gavin Hastings at the table. ''Yes,'' I said.
''Talk to you later then,'' said Gavin.
Hastings was having some interviews done for his video, and I passed
John Jeffrey just as he was telling the camera that Gavin was ''Average
. . . a fairly average player''. And that was early too.
Much later, JJ, who was sitting beside Gary Armstrong, was well into
the flow of things. Kelso played Jed-Forest the following day, but
Jeffrey didn't seem to be particularly caring. Armstrong was drinking
water. ''Gary, if you come near me tomorrow you've had it,'' he said,
motioning a high tackle and grabbing him around the shoulder. ''And I
hear that now you're moving to Newcastle your book is to be called
Jethart's Gone! Drinks are on Armstrong, he can afford it now.''
The auction was something else. Hastings, who didn't make the Famous
XV, unlike his brother, auctioned his last ever international jersey.
Gavin has been ousted in the joust for the best-ever full back slot by
Ken Scotland, and Andy Irvine was on the wing. As I have said before, I
am in the second team with Gav and we would stuff the so-called Famous
XV senseless any place, any day.
Wags suggested that Gavin's jersey has been auctioned a few times
before, and queried whether Gavin ever wore a size 38 with ''Made in
Taiwan'' on the collar. But there you have it.
Gavin, who wore a fetching three-piece tartan suit that matched the
one Scott wore on the night, said that this had indeed been his last
jersey, and, by the way, he was wearing the tartan suit so that he could
sell a few to interested parties on a commission basis in this new
commercial world. Gavin -- no chance! Gareth Edwards, who spoke
magnificently, hinted at the generosity of the buyer of Gavin's jersey.
''Such a lot of money for a Scottish jersey,'' said Edwards. ''When we
played here, you bastards wouldn't even swop them.''
It's the scoops that come out on these nights that interest me.
Colin Deans told us that he is now coaching with Ian McGeechan at
Northampton. We didn't believe him. How can you believe a Hawick man
that once moved to Gala. John Gallagher, the former All Black who turned
to rugby league, is now training with Harlequins.
And did you know that Peter Wright picked up his new sponsored car on
Friday? A lovely gleaming big thing it is, and it has an extra silencer
fitted to it.
These nights are strange things, you know. There are a few odd souls
in life, people who won't enter into the warmth of a group occasion with
their whole hearts, but they are few and far between. Rugby, for it is a
changing game on and off the green stuff, is now generating its fair
share of egos with their own petty rivalries -- some of them long held
-- but these things disappear when more important events come to light.
Mike Biggar's horrific injury was one such important event.
I suppose I have to realise that many folk never saw Mike play. He was
my first captain. Craig Chalmers said to me during the dinner that he
never saw Ken Scotland play. Neither did I, and one day there will be a
youngster playing in the Scotland No.10 jersey who didn't see Craig
Chalmers make a break.
A night like the one on Friday reminded me that most of us who are
involved in the game now, and that includes the current players, are
just bit parts in one long piece of continuity called rugby. One day
there will be no Jim Telfer, no Bill Hogg, no Duncan Paterson, and no
David Johnston. There will be no Craig Chalmers, no Peter Wright, and no
Rob Wainwright. Hopefully, there will still be rugby.
I enjoyed Friday night so much I couldn't speak on the bus home.
I just hope now that rugby treats every injured player, and the game
itself, as generously as it has treated Mike.

THE game, and those involved in it, have over the past couple of
months taken on the demeanour of those poor souls who were evacuated
from the trenches on the Somme and Ypres during the First World War.
They bore no traces of physical hurt. They were denied the red badge of
courage signified by the blood-soaked bandage, yet they were just as
unfit for combat as their compadres who suffered tangible injury and who
were on the next channel ferry back to Blighty.
Shell-shock is what we are talking about here. Gavin Hastings will
have won himself few friends at Murrayfield with his comments on these
pages about the manner in which the transition from the amateur game to
an ''open'' sport in which, it seems, anything goes has been handled.
Nevertheless, as one surveys the legions of rugby folk up and down the
country, with their vacant expressions and ''nobody knows what happens
next'' demeanours, you have to concede that Hastings has a point when he
declares that the administrators have thrown the game to the wolves.
Of course, it is easy to be critical from the sidelines when one has
not been charged with the almost impossible task of steering the game
from its century-old amateur ethos to the bright sunlit uplands of
professionalism (that at least was how it appeared at the end of August)
but from Hastings' perspective, and that of many other onlookers, it
certainly does look now as though the game has been bound hand and foot
and offered as sustenance for the wolf-pack of market forces.
The basic problem, as Hastings observes, is that the game -- or at
least that part of it, like an iceberg, that we can see on the
media-exposed surface -- has gone pro without an infrastructure to
support it and to give it succour. With the benefit of hindsight, we can
now say without contradiction that what was really required, certainly
in the Northern hemisphere, was a bespoke structure into which the
professional game would have slotted.
And when Hastings says that the professional game must be run by
professionals, he was echoing, word for word, what Sir John Hall -- that
huge Geordie fly in the establishment ointment -- told me just six weeks
ago.
Hall envisages a professional game administered by a Football
League-type body with the rest of the game -- the silent but just as
important majority -- looked after by something like a rugby equivalent
of the Football Association. There's sense in that.
The Scottish Rugby Union has already gone some way towards
streamlining its monolithic committee structure. The Murrayfield
mandarins know full well that, in a commercial world, where
communication is almost instantaneous and where speed is of the essence,
a system which revolves around monthly meetings just does not cut the
financial mustard.
Almost every day -- as those of us who report on the game and its
politics have discovered to our sleepless cost over the past couple of
months -- there is some new initiative, some fresh fragment of shrapnel
from the bomb which blew amateurism away nine weeks ago.
And it is not over yet. Not by a long chalk. There are still more
questions left unanswered than in a game of Trivial Pursuit played by
the Pontypool front row. Just the other week I asked SRU director of
rugby Jim Telfer if he would care to speculate on how the game might
look a month, or a year, or a decade from now.
Wisely, he demurred. He was, he said, having as much difficulty as the
rest of us in determining what might happen tomorrow, never mind what
might transpire even in the medium term. That is the state we have all
got ourselves into.
The transition to professionalism, as we have observed before, was
inevitable. But with the benefit of hindsight -- which as we all know is
the epitome of 20-20 vision -- Hastings, a Lion among not a few lambs,
is right when he says that the abruptness with which the IB declared the
game professional, without properly thought-out guidelines or a
structure in which to operate, was, indeed, tantamount to throwing it to
the wolves.

Clare Henry surfs the Internet and finds Scottish artists creating a
stir worldwide
FIRST on the Internet? A brave pioneering step into cyberspace and not
what you'd immediately expect from a 104-year-old organisation. But the
Society of Scottish Artists (SSA) is something special. The SSA makes
life exciting, embraces the experimental, champions young artists, is
both democratic and at the cutting edge. It pioneered video and
installation in the 1970s. Indeed as the art history books tell us, back
in 1931 it was the SSA who brought Munch's controversial work to Britain
-- and created a furore. Happily it has been stirring things up ever
since.
Interesting that it takes a voluntary artist-run enterprise, not a
publicly funded art gallery, to be the first major exhibition on the
Net, (beating the Arts Council's national British Art Show by a week.)
SCRAN, the #7.5m Lottery-funded millennium project for museums in
Scotland has until 2001 to get itself on-line, with no promise of art
world involvement, but says it is open to offers.
So, is viewing from the armchair the future? Will we see exhibitions
on a screen instead of getting sore feet? I set out to look at the pros
and cons. First learning the jargon for ''surfing the Net'' with its
home pages, bookmarks, urls, nodes and the like; then downloading the
SSA images via http://www-edin.easynet.co.uk/ssa. We're off.
An eye-catching SSA logo by The Herald's Roy Petrie is followed by
glamorous photographs of society president Lys Hansen, before the index
is shown divided into sections such as painting and sculpture and, at
the end, a slot for recent Scottish graduates. Dive in to find Naoka
Takematsu who rightly won the Munro sculpture prize for her superb
bronze Snake cast in 28 pieces.
A tiny squiggle in a two-inch top left square slowly appears on
screen. Hard to see, but a double click enlarges it into a passable
image. Next June Carey's fantasy she-devil with ominous, orange tail and
intense blue sky; then Alison Newman's bold black etchings. In all 100
images from 60 artists.
The technology and skill required has generously been contributed by
Edinburgh's Cyberia Cafe in Hanover Street, one of three busy Internet
cafes there. Now anyone on the worldwide web can call up work by top
names such as Wyllie, Donald, Summerton, Duffin, Banks, Cherubini,
Butler and Munro alongside new Scottish graduates.
I asked colleagues around the globe from Amsterdam to Hobart, Berlin
to Chicago to respond. All favourable. Professor Ken Kerslake of the
University of Florida said: ''The SSA looks strong. The images are clear
and enlarge well and rapidly. I enjoyed seeing it.''
So, it is easy viewing, but what are the shortcomings? Gestural,
painterly images, especially subtle abstracts or gently textured prints
suffer, even more than they do in catalogues, from translation via
digitalised pointillist pixels. Scale too is entirely lacking so that
Rance's small Anticipation appears exactly the same size as Russell's
seven-foot canvas. There are limitations of tone, constraints of layout
-- and it is slow.
I went to Edinburgh to see the real thing,, and I still prefer it.
The SSA show looks terrific. A vibrant, massed display of fascinating
art sits well on brightly-coloured walls left by the Festival show.
Turquoise and terracotta, they sing with huge bold paintings, fragile
glass constructions, flickering video, rough and ready constructions in
both bare wood and carnival colours. The floor is scattered with
sculptures in bronze, brass, rubber, straw, steel, wood, plaster, cloth,
wax -- even fur. Wade's idiosyncratic water mobile creaks and splashes.
MacManus's vulgar fun fair phallic Tickle Me Pink and Roe's Gag make
you smile. Godfrey's giant metal cylinder acts like op art. Intense
photographs by Ruscoe and witty boxes by Strang hang near Brittain's
innovative streetscape ceramic panels, cast paper Ragas from Heughan and
elegant dishes by Miller. How do you capture that on a 14-inch screen?
As Hansen says: ''In hanging the pictures the human hand creates yet
another dimension. The vibrations from one image to another are very
important.'' She's right. There's nothing to replace the smell and
patina of paint or buzz of bronze.
Take Takematsu's snake for example. The Internet doesn't begin to do
it justice. In the flesh it shimmers and gleams, different textures
charting her autobigraphy from a straightforward childhood via the
twists and turns of student years in Tsukuba to a smooth postgraduate
degree in Edinburgh (''I came because they have a foundary'', she says.)
The Internet is still useful as a taster and if you live in Singapore
or Texas it gives an indication of the serious calibre of SSA work. But
it has its downside and in the end you still have to use your eyes --
and feet.
After four years as an enterprising, energetic president, Hansen is
handing over to Gwyneth Leech (who shows an intriguing four-storey
video), while completing projects for Berlin and Stirling. From February
through April the SSA will extend its remit to Central region with three
new shows at Stirling's MacRobert Arts Centre, Smith Gallery and The
Curran. Let's hope they go on the Internet too!

ACCORDING to a decade of official statistics, Grampian region should
be Scotland's success story. While in the Central Belt traditional
industries vanished, offshore oil and gas made Grampian into an economic
powerhouse -- and Aberdeen into the Oil Capital of Europe. Briefly, in
1986, when Opec countries flooded the world oil market, the image went
sour. Jobs evaporated. Houses were abandoned. Oil-related companies went
belly up.
By and large, the 1986 debacle was written off as a ''blip''. Soon
after, accompanied by endless ''Boom Time for North-east'' headlines, it
was business as usual.
Between 1981 and 1991, Grampian's population increased by 6%. Despite
persistent pockets of human misery, especially in Moray, the official
unemployment rate steadied at 5%. Sixty-five per cent of the area's
people were listed as economically active.
Nearly a decade after Opec's price-cutting spree, Aberdonians are
again suffering an outbreak of the jitters. Negative equity in the
housing market, short-term employment contracts -- and the grim
realities of life on the dole -- are back on the North-east's agenda.
Solicitors and estate agents admit that Aberdeen's house prices have
slumped by approximately 5%.
Dennis Nicol, co-ordinator of the Aberdeen-based Instant Neighbour
Charity -- set up 11 years ago to provide basic food, bedding, and
furniture to those Aberdonians who never did benefit from the arrival of
black gold -- believes the situation is much worse than that. ''A year
ago, our referral rate was 700 cases a month. Now, it's 1100 a month and
growing. We're seeing desperate people who can't sell their houses at
all.''
As the Aberdeen housing market freezes, oil operators and contractors
are cutting jobs. Out-sourcing is increasingly common -- with staff
transferred, on lower wages, to contractors handling tasks such as
accounts or maintenance services. Offshore, automation is in full swing.
Remote operating of wells is expanding. And informed Aberdonians are
only too aware that the industry is looking to the Atlantic.
At Instant Neighbour, poor people from deprived housing schemes are
joined by new clients whose lives have been devastated by rapid change
in the offshore industry. Nicol says: ''A recent case was a man from the
huge Portlethen estate south of the city. He earned #60,000 a year in
the oil. When his job went, he was down to basic benefit levels. The
family struggled for three months to sell their house. There were no
takers. One night, they just put the keys through the building society's
door, took the kids out of school -- and vanished.''
He says crisis is destroying marriages, too. ''Another client didn't
actually lose his job. He was demoted considerably -- and put on a
one-year contract. The family couldn't possibly keep up. Their spending
was three times their new income. The guy did a runner. We're still
struggling to get a house for his wife and children.''
The house-sales impasse affects every part of Aberdeen. In the largely
Victorian suburb of Torry, dozens of tenement flats have been up for
sale for many months.
In 1986, the sprawling Bridge of Don area became a national visual
symbol of Aberdeen's distress. In the area's Lee Crescent North,
virtually every house was up for sale. John and Moira Wood (not their
real names) put their 1980s two-bedroom semi-detached in a nearby street
up for sale in January this year -- at a fixed price of #54,000. ''In
September, we gave the keys back to the bank. God knows what we'll do
now.'' The Woods are in a furnished flat in Torry -- available,
ironically, because its owner had waited two years for a buyer.
Dennis Nicol -- a member of Aberdeen's post-1966 unitary council --
still backs hopes that Aberdeen can survive as in internationally
recognised centre of oil technology.
He hopes also that Aberdeen's two universities will expand rapidly --
providing secure employment into the twenty-first century. Wages will be
much lower than during the heyday of oil extraction -- and house prices
will stay depressed.
Professor Magnus Fladmark, head of Robert Gordon University's Heritage
Unit, suggests that the North-east's past could play a key role in
extracting opportunity from crisis.
''Apart from the whisky trails and castles, most of Grampian's
heritage is the best-kept secret in the world. Few places on earth have
a better heritage mix than the North-east. It could mean lots of jobs.
But it needs commitment, partnership and imagination.''
While movers and shakers such as Nicol and Fladmark work hard to
secure their city's future, the Woods have their heads down. ''We're
just terrified the bank locates us and hits us with a huge bill for
mortgage arrears.''
Soon, too, district councillors and officials will pile into coaches
to tour the Bridge of Don. They won't be counting empty homes and
forests of ''For Sale'' signs. The priority mission is to track down
unauthorised hamburger vans.

BBC Scotland all but swept the board in the biennial Scottish Bafta
Awards in Aberdeen, taking 12 of the 15 television prizes on offer.
Executives at Scottish Television, which has already accused the BBC of
''loading'' the Bafta Scotland membership, were furious to discover they
had gained only two awards. Grampian, which was hosting the event,
received one.
It was noticeable that Scottish Television's senior management was
missing from Saturday night's gala event. Managing director Mr Gus
Macdonald apparently had a previous engagement.
There was some consolation, however, for Scottish with the night's top
accolade, a lifetime achievement award, going to Dr Finlay actor Ian
Bannen. Film of Bannen, whose last movie role was in Braveheart, being
presented with his award in America by Mel Gibson was shown during the
event.
Top of the BBC Scotland's prize list was a best actor award for Hamish
Macbeth star Bobby Carlyle and a best drama series award for Takin' Over
The Asylum. The top actress award went to Siobhan Redmond for the Tartan
Short, Latin For A Dark Room.
Comedian Billy Connolly, who has never won a Bafta before, made up for
lost time by being connected with three awards. The BBC film, Down Among
The Big Boys, in which Connolly starred, won best single drama. His
series, The Bigger Picture, won best arts programme and Billy Connolly's
World Tour of Scotland took the best entertainment programme award.
Scottish Television's two prizes were The Herald Television Reporter
Award, which went to Scottish Women presenter Kaye Adams, and best
children's programme, How 2. A special Bafta Craft Award was presented
to Scottish lighting cameraman Jim Peters. Grampian Television won the
award for best news programme for Grampian North Tonight.
In the feature film categories, the top movie award went to Shallow
Grave and there was a best actor award for John Hannah for his
performance in Four Weddings and a Funeral.
The full list of awards were: best single drama -- Down Among The Big
Boys, best drama series -- Takin' Over The Asylum, best Feature film --
Shallow Grave, best short film -- Fridge, best documentary -- The
Gamekeeper, best current affairs programme -- Frontline Scotland, best
arts programme -- The Bigger Picture, best entertainment programme --
Billy Connolly's World Tour of Scotland, best film actor -- John Hannah,
best television actor -- Robert Carlyle, best actress (film or
television) -- Siobhan Redmond, The Herald Television Reporter Award --
Kaye Adams, best children's programme -- How 2, best special interest
programme -- The Edge, best writer -- Donna Franceschild, best news
programme -- Grampian Television, best outside broadcast -- The
Edinburgh Tattoo '94, Craft Award for Outstanding Contribution to Film
and Television --  Jim Peters, lifetime achievement award -- Ian Bannen.

WHEN Gordon MacIntyre scored Oban Camanachd's second goal in their
Celtic Society Cup match against Glasgow University on Saturday, he did
much more than bury the students' chances of progressing in the sport's
oldest competition.
MacIntyre, the 29-year-old internationalist who lost an eye in an
accident when playing just seven weeks ago, had completed one of
shinty's most remarkable comebacks.
A computer engineer, MacIntyre had taken what he referred to as ''a
huge step personally'' just days before, resuming his professional
career with the new company which had held his job for him since the
accident.
Driving a car within days of his discharge from hospital, MacIntyre
had proceeded to re-adjust to his new circumstances by hitting hundreds
of golf balls on a range in Glasgow. He was soon hitting two-under-par
rounds on the city's Mount Ellen course.
The biggest step of all was to resume his shinty career which had
ground to a halt so abruptly at Kingussie when, on the verge of yet
another international cap, he lost an eye when hit by the ball.
MacIntyre's recovery was driven by a single-mindedness which has
proved to be the key factor in a remarkable recovery. Apart from the
obvious re-adjustments to his personal life, the challenges of a new job
and a new home in Cumbernauld, there was, above all, the determination
to play shinty again.
To do that, he had to convince the sport's authorities of the need to
be able to wear facial protection, a luxury only afforded to players
under the age of 14, although Irish players were not prohibited from
wearing protection in the international matches.
The upshot was that MacIntyre presented the game's ruling body, the
Camanachd Association, with an ice hockey helmet and visor on Friday
night, asking their permission to use it on Saturday. That permission
was granted, albeit despite some reservations, and players now have the
chance to experiment with visors or other face-guards for the rest of
the season.
MacIntyre's performance on Saturday, in the unaccustomed role of
full-forward was a revelation, and predictably attracted a large crowd.
To play the 90 minutes was an achievement; to complete the effort with
a stunning goal two minutes from the end was remarkable.
MacIntyre said he would now be continuing with the experimentation,
and taking each match as it comes. ''I am elated to have proved to
myself that I could do this,'' said MacIntyre. ''It was an unbelievable
experience to have come from what I went through seven weeks ago. And to
cap it all with that goal, it's fabulous.''
MacIntyre found the helmet, which weighs 3lbs and is bulky compared to
other versions available, little of a hindrance. ''I was a bit
disoriented when I fell, but that's nothing unusual and I am delighted
with what I achieved.
''There are two things I have to do now. To find out whether the
anti-fogging device will work in the rain, and then tackle more
competitive matches.
''With respect to Glasgow, they are not in the same class as the
premier league sides I normally faced, so that will be the next
challenge. I have an open mind on the helmets and visors though, and if
something better comes up, I will take a careful look at it.''
MacIntyre's decision to experiment with the full-face, perspex visor
may not be the long-term answer to the issue of facial protection. Dr
Colin Fettes, of the sports injury clinic in Inverness, has urged
caution, although he has welcomed the Camanachd Association's decision
to make facial protection optional pending a review.
Dr Fettes, who would like to see a meeting of players and officials to
discuss the way forward said: ''I feel that the wire face-guards are
still the best option and the association has, in fact, taken possession
of custom-built models made in Ireland which offer what I think is
better protection. They are lighter than the ice-hockey helmet and
visor, which just wasn't designed for the same thing.
''And they are also cheaper -- about half the cost -- and that has to
be a factor. Having said that, the decision to permit the helmets even
on the trial basis is a step forward.''
MacIntyre approaches the rest of his renewed shinty career with huge
optimism and a clear idea of what he would like to achieve: ''I always
said I had to try this, and having got through 90 minutes, I can only
say it was an unbelievable experience.
''Lying in bed just seven weeks ago, I had no doubt that I could do
this, but there is always the possibility that I could not. You have to
find out for yourself and I am delighted to have got this far. Every
game is a bonus and if I can continue with this sort of progress, then
all my hard work over the last few weeks will have been worthwhile.''

As yet another Highland estate is sold off to an absentee landlord,
Margaret Vaughan considers the case for land ownership restrictions
AN heiress to the richest and most secretive family in Britain is
Scotland's latest absentee landlord. Lisbet Koerner, a Harvard professor
who, with her academic husband Joseph, lives in a splendid old colonial
home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Her new playground is 48,000 wild acres of the West Highlands, the
Corrour estate, a sporting paradise of stalking, trout fishing, and
grouse shooting, bought for #3m.
Lisbet, 35, is the eldest daughter of Hans Rausing, a Swedish-tax
exile who, with his brother Gans, heads the league of the super-rich
with a fortune estimated at #5.2 billion.
Prising out information about the family is about as easy as opening
one of the Tetrapak milk cartons on which the fortune was built. The
brothers have clung fiercely to privacy since joining their father's
company and launching the tetrahedron-shaped milk packages in 1952.
In the early eighties the brothers made their homes in Britain, it is
understood, to escape the taxation laws of their Scandinavian homeland.
Lisbet married her American husband Joseph, a fine art historian and
graduate of Harvard and Cambridge in 1988. They have two children,
Benjamin and Sigrid. In August her father sold the family business
interests to his brother. The sale put Lisbet, who had been mentioned as
a possible heir apparent to the company, firmly out of the picture. It
may, though, explain her decision to invest #3m in the remote acres of a
sporting estate which lies some 30 miles north of Fort William.
The softly-spoken, slightly lisping lecturer whose specialism is the
history of science, was maintaining the family tradition of discreet
silence after news of her purchase slipped out.
It seems unlikely that the isolated Corrour estate, reached by a
12-mile dirt road, has been bought as a commercial proposition. Locals
believe the couple and their two children plan to holiday there, leaving
the day-to-day management to the staff of four who maintain the estate.
''Well, I suppose it's better them than somebody wanting to destroy
the estate with a holiday development,'' was as much as any local would
say about the purchase.
But, then, Highlanders long ago became used to the insecurities of a
system of land tenure which allows anyone to purchase vast swathes of
the last wilderness acres. No other country in Europe allows the
free-market sale of land on such a scale.
Despite Michael Forsyth recently astounding crofters by calling on
lairds to follow the Government's example and hand over their land to
the people, many of the large Scottish estates remain the property of
absentee landlords. They range from Middle East oil sheiks to Pacific
Rim investors, Dutch and Danish companies to rock stars.
The Scottish Crofters Union, who broadly welcomed Mr Forsyth's
initiative, insist there remain real concerns in parts of the Highlands
and Islands about the ownership of land. Not least, perhaps, on Eigg
where islanders wait to learn their fate as their latest laird, the
German artist Maruma, is investigated by the public prosecutor's office
in Stuttgart over a #1.6m loan.
Last week, a 41,000-acre estate in the Cairngorms, Glenavon, was sold
to a Malaysian businessman. Near Stranraer, the Logan estate, which has
been in the same family for 700 years, has been sold to a London-based
businessman.
Both Labour and the Scottish National Party want to see land reform.
They believe Scotland's archaic feudal system needs to be changed to
give security to local communities and protect the environment.
Rob Gibson, the SNP's land spokesman, said it proposed radical
policies which would seek to create widespread ownership of land and
coastal resources by resident populations: ''We would be prepared to
take powers to favour residents over absentees when property is sold.''
Labour MP and publisher of the radical West Highland Free Press, Brian
Wilson, has long campaigned for land reform. ''We need a Land Commission
to examine every proposed sale, with power to intervene where social or
environmental interests are involved.''
The Scottish Landowners' Federation, meanwhile, has welcomed the
inward investment which the new owners of the Corrour estate are making
in Scotland. They argue that the cost of buying and running such a vast
sporting estate is so high that the majority of Scots couldn't afford
it.

ROUND-UP
THE organisers of shinty's oldest competition, the Glasgow Celtic
Society Cup, are facing renewed calls for seeding following another set
of mis-matches highlighting the lop-sided nature of some games in the
South of Scotland area.
Edinburgh and St Andrews universities found themselves on the wrong
end of double-figure defeats on Saturday in the first round of this
season's competition, leaving Oban Celtic the only premier league side
to go out at the first hurdle.
Kyles Athletic, who declined to play in this season's pilot premier
league, but are obviously a class apart in the first division, hit 14
without reply at Edinburgh. St Andrews' multi-national squad were only
slightly better placed against Glenorchy, scoring one but conceding 13.
The benefit to either student team of being hammered in such a
pointless fashion is threatening to devalue the south area's premier cup
competition, and the fact that Celtic have gone out of the competition
at an early stage could bring the disquiet about the format to a head.
Celtic led last season's winners of the trophy, Inveraray, by two
goals until the 75-minute mark at Ganavan. Celtic had a third
controversially disallowed a minute earlier, and when Inveraray went to
the other end to score almost immediately, a fightback was on the cards.
Substitute Scott Robinson, recovering from concussion which had him
hospitalised after training in midweek, scored two goals in quick
succession, and Garry MacPherson added a fourth to complete a fine
fightback in just 20 minutes. Inveraray now go on to meet Tayforth in
round two.
Oban Camanachd, last year's south champions, struggled to overcome
Glasgow University, with Gordon Macintyre's strike after 88 minutes
putting a somewhat flattering gloss on the result for the struggling
Oban team.
In the north, Caberfeidh and Lochaber fought out a 10-goal thriller at
Strathpeffer during which the home team staged their own remarkable
fightback.
Lochaber appeared to be coasting when they led 4-1, but Cabers clawed
their way back into the match and hit five goals in the last half hour,
including a treble in five minutes from Stewart MacLennan, Robert
Bartlett, and Martin MacLean.
Cabers' prize is a second-round tie with Newtonmore who comfortably
accounted for Inverness, although they lost experienced defender Norman
MacArthur with a hand injury.
Cup holders Kingussie romped to a five-goal victory over Glenurquhart,
with Ronald Ross scoring four goals to edge his total to 29 for the
season. Kingussie now meet Skye in the next round following their away
win at Beauly, and this will mean that Kingussie have to go across the
bridge twice in the next three weeks, as they face Skye in the Keyline
MacAulay Cup this weekend.
Fort William returned to some sort of form with Ally Ferguson
returning to the forward line, scoring twice against Kinlochshiel.

THE cost of school meals throughout Britain has risen by 5% putting
them further out of the reach of low-paid parents, according to a survey
by trade union Unison.
However, parents of Scottish children pay far less for their meals
than their counterparts south of the Border. Primary school meals range
from 65p in Fife and Dumfries and Galloway to #1.25 in the London
borough of Brent. The average is #1.03 (88p in Scotland).
In secondary schools, the cheapest meals are to be had in Fife (65p)
and the most expensive are in Greenwich, Havering and Harrow, all
London, at #1.50.
Many authorities were reluctant to reveal information on subsidies
but, of those answering, 38% (42 authorities) had stopped providing
subsidy to either primary or secondary school meals or both.

If luck is the final protection, no security force in the world can
provide any guarantee
John Linklater considers the fragile security screen that stands
between a world leader and a deadly assailant
IF the unrivalled Israeli security forces failed to place an
impenetrable shield around their own Prime Minister to defend him from
assassination by a fellow citizen, where in the world can a political
leader be assumed safe?
The answer has always been nowhere. John F Kennedy provided tragic
confirmation of his own fatalistic assertion that there would never be
any way to stop an assassin who was intent on getting the job done.
Personal security systems may have tightened with ruthless
sophistication since Kennedy was allowed to be exposed to rifle fire in
an open car on the streets of Dallas, but so long as an American
President or a British Prime Minister or an Israeli Premier insists upon
any degree of personal contact with his or her electorate they will
remain fragile.
Yitzhak Rabin, unlike Kennedy, was the first leader of his nation to
be slain, yet it is unimaginable that even a shred of complacency
contributed to his death at the weekend. Israel has never known the
luxury of that innocence towards the possibility of violence that might
have added to the mortal danger Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme walked
into the night in March 1988 when he was gunned down in Stockholm
leaving a cinema with his wife, or the afternoon in March 1979 when
Airey Neave reached for his ignition keys in the Commons car park.
The world has had to become more alert to the dangers, even if it
continues to be unable to avert them. Increased security has proved of
no avail when the assassins themselves, as in the gunning down of
President Anwar Sadat at a military parade in Cairo and of Premier Li
Peng of China at an inspection tour in Tiananmen Square, have been
security guards of their victims.
That Rabin was leaving a rally devoted to the idea of peace was enough
to place him in the highest category of risk, since the current process
exposes its political architects to the highest personal risk in an
Israel torn between rival fanaticisms.
The greater tragedy in the past three decades is that it is precisely
advocates of moderation and conciliation, like Rabin, who have been most
vulnerable to assassins. To assassinate a dictator or a political tyrant
has always proved more difficult. From the failure of the July 1944 bomb
plot against Hitler to the US Air Force attempts to liquidate President
Gaddafi with a series of laser-guided bombs, and from 25 abortive
attempts on Fidel Castro (in which the CIA were implicated) to the
Western world's fervent discussion on ways to assist a successful
follow-up to at least 13 known attempts on Saddam Hussein, there has
emerged a survival mystique surrounding the autocrats of history.
Even the most accessible, or at least publicly vain, of this breed
learned how to make difficult targets of themselves. Mussolini, who
needed the crowd, rode a motor cycle in his own escort team and placed a
nervous decoy in the hot seat of his limousine.
Such a thin subterfuge would be laughable today. Yet the reputation of
Shin Bet, Israel's internal security police, with its special wing
acting as security for VIPs, will never be the same again. Even the
identity of the head of Shin Bet is unknown, withheld as a State secret.
Reports that he was last night returning from abroad to Israel were as
astonishing as the fact that his organisation allowed itself to be
penetrated by an individual able to fire off three shots from close
range.
When the inevitable official investigation gets under way one of the
first questions will be why Israel's chief internal security officer was
absent from a 100,000-strong rally known in advance to be targeted by
extremist right-wing groups. For two years the peace process has led to
open aggression towards Mr Rabin and other top government officials,
intensifying since the end of September when Israel and the PLO signed a
historic accord over the West Bank at the White House in Washington.
There was a necessary stepping up of security arrangements against
political assassination for Mr Rabin, who had insisted previously on
only a cordon of three bodyguards. The weekend's tragedy mocks the
recent appeal by Israel's Minister of Police, Mr Moshe Shahal, for
right-wing opposition politicians to moderate an anti-government
rhetoric which accused Mr Rabin and his colleagues of being
''murderers'' and ''traitors'', in the wake of suicide bombings on buses
by the Islamic militants of Hamas, equally intransigent to peace.
The shock to the Israeli psyche now is that one of their own, no
matter how crazed a fanatic and no matter how much a loner in the
established tradition of assassins, should resort to a violence beyond
words. If this will prove difficult to contemplate in a culture that
prides itself on being a democracy where Jew-on-Jew confrontation is
rarely physical, it will remain impossible to accept sources who suggest
that the security establishment was not psychologically prepared for the
possibility of an attack on the Prime Minister by a Jew.
''The right side of my brain didn't connect with the left,'' leading
Israeli commentator Nomi Levitsky told me yesterday. ''I saw it. I was
there, but I didn't realise what I was seeing. I heard the shot and I
didn't know what I was hearing. It took me quite a few seconds to
realise what had happened. We parted with him and he went downstairs.
''I stayed up on the balcony and looked down and I saw the whole thing
happen. Hell broke loose and I didn't know if he was hurt, because I saw
him fall and the security fall on top of him. I was hoping it might be
the same as in Los Angeles when there was an attempt on Reagan and the
security forces fell on him to save his life. But they jumped just a
split second too late.''
When the shock subsides, the inquest will focus on that fatal split
second. Other questions will follow. Why was an armed man allowed
anywhere near Rabin? Why was the Prime Minister not wearing a
bullet-proof vest? Why was the assailant not shot by Rabin's bodyguards?
How did he have time to fire three shots?
The answers will be attended by security forces guarding leaders of
every nation. When Gorbachev visited London he had four personal
bodyguards as a protection team, but it was swollen by another 356 KGB
officials acting as ''sweepers''. In Britain, party to another peace
process, the Diplomatic Protection Force receives SAS weapons training
and a closer intelligence back-up from the Ministry of Defence than when
Lord Mountbatten was blown up in his boat off the Sligo coast in 1979
after spurning security.
The turning point for British security came after the 1984 Brighton
hotel bombing. Such events demonstrate that political leadership in a
democracy not only requires personal courage, but also an unquantifiable
degree of luck.
That is the chilling thought. If luck is the final protection, and no
security force in the world can provide any guarantee, then no leader in
the twentieth century has ever been safe, or will be again.

TWO former Prime Ministers have paid tribute to Lord Bottomley, the
former Labour Cabinet Minister who handled the Rhodesia crisis in the
1960s, and whose death, at 88, was announced on Saturday.
Lord Bottomley, who had been in poor health for many months, served as
Commonwealth Secretary and Minister for Overseas Development in Mr
Harold Wilson's first Labour Government.
Lord Callaghan said: ''He was a man of sterling worth. His heart was
always with the Commonwealth countries and peoples and he played a great
part in both Burma, immediately after the war, and later in Rhodesia.''
Sir Edward Heath said: ''Arthur Bottomley was highly respected and
much liked in both Houses of Parliament. He handled Ian Smith's attempt
to create an entirely independent Rhodesia calmly and firmly.''
During that critical period, Arthur Bottomley, as he then was, had
many verbal brushes with Mr Smith.
Lord Bottomley was a Londoner, even though he represented
Middlesbrough for many years.
During the last war, he controlled air raid precautions in London when
Hitler's bombers began pounding the capital. He became known as Mr
Blitz.

THERE'S a Chinese proverb, Mr Wu Yingmin explained, which says that
it's much better to see something once than to hear of it a hundred
times. Mr Wu, principal of the Heroes private -- yes, private -- school
in the People's Republic of China, has been putting the proverb into
practice on a visit to education establishments in Britain.
Last week he and colleagues from the booming province of Guangdong
visited private schools -- and one from the state sector -- in Scotland
as guests of the international arm of Strathclyde region. Strathclyde
International, which co-ordinates the authority's overseas work from
placing foreign students on programmes with the council to tendering for
international consultancies, sees no direct benefit coming from
organising this particular trip.
The authority is, of course, in the business of managing state
schooling, offering equality of access and opportunity, something which
those of us who are not up to speed on Chinese educational matters
assumed was also the case in the huge communist country.
Not entirely so, as Mr Wu explained before his delegation left Glasgow
to visit Eton and Cambridge University on the next leg of their mission
to establish if any lessons can be learned from British private schools
for their particular brand of an elitist education.
''There is no contradiction between the goal of equality and setting
up independent schools in China,'' said Mr Wu. ''The reason is because
the government doesn't have enough money to invest in schools, so it
encourages independent companies and other organisations to set up
schools on their own.
''There is no friction between the two. Because of China's rapid
progress there is a great demand for well-educated, qualified people,
and if independent schools are being set up it just means there are more
educational opportunities on offer. They work according to policies
formulated by the central government.''
When the Chinese government came up with a particular solution to a
particular problem three years ago it also found that it was able to tap
into a growing, unsatisfied demand for the finest of schooling.
Although political reform has been stifled, the open market economy in
China has sent free enterprise soaring in provinces such as Guangdong,
where rapid economic growth has produced many rich people who want the
very best for their children -- a desire intensified by the imposition
of the one-child per family policy introduced by the government to curb
population growth.
At the same time, the government was finding that it lacked
sufficient, qualified professional people in areas such as technology,
engineering, education, and languages to keep pace with spiralling
growth. So it introduced measures which allowed businesses to build
private schools.
In Guangdong, which is twinned with Strathclyde, a young magnate, Mr
Chen Zhong Lian, bought 750 acres of land about 90km from the provincial
capital of Guangzhou for his Heroes school. Its primary and secondary
school sections will eventually have 1400 pupils each, as well as a
school for retired people. The secondary roll has already risen to 400
pupils.
Although the independent schools will have different strengths they
will all be run on a model dictated by the government. To secure a
place, pupils must pass an entrance test but their parents must also pay
a large lump sum at the start of schooling. In the case of the Heroes
school, the fee is #25,000, a financial stipulation which, at face value
anyway, seems to be as remote from any notion of equality as it is
possible to get.
The fee is used, however, to cover every cost a pupil will incur --
from board, lodgings, books, and tuition to uniform, sports equipment,
and pocket money -- for as long as he or she attends the school. That
could cover 14 years, from the age of five to 17. The school authorities
invest the lump sum and use the interest accrued to meet all costs. In a
1400-pupil primary the annual intake would be 200 pupils, giving a total
yearly lump sum of #5m to invest.
And when the pupil leaves school the #25,000 fee is returned to the
parents. To put this particular financial arrangement in context,
parents who send a child to board in a Scottish independent school
commonly pay between #8000 and #12,000 a year in fees, adding up to
between #112,000 and #168,000 over 14 years.
At the Heroes school -- which takes its name from Mr Chen's business,
Guangzhou Heroes Industry Ltd -- the aim is to achieve a higher standard
than exists in the Chinese state sector, with strong emphasis on the
teaching of English from primary one onwards.
Mr Wu said: ''According to government provisions, schools are not to
make a profit. They must reinvest any profits in the school. The
government's policy is not only to promote equality, but also
development, so that in the field of education there can be different
levels of education according to the needs of society.''
The Scottish visit happened under the auspices of the
Strathclyde-Guangdong friendship agreement and the delegation visited
the region's Douglas Academy and the independent Fettes College in
Edinburgh and Lomond School in Helensburgh.
''In the UK, the independent schools have a history of several
centuries so we want to learn from their experience. We have found that
they are run more strictly, they put more emphasis on the development of
pupils' character, they have a sense of responsibility and teamwork, and
they are more flexible in offering special courses,'' said Mr Wu.

TENNIS ROUND-UP
TIM Henman yesterday defeated Greg Rusedski at Telford to become the
youngest winner of a Guardian Direct National title.
Henman dropped in the domestic pecking order when Montreal-born
Rusedski opted to represent Britain in May. But the 21-year-old from
Oxford outranked Rusedski yesterday, recovering from a set and a service
break down to win his second successive tournament.
''I showed a lot of guts,'' said Henman. ''I didn't panic after losing
the first set and decided I should knuckle down. I'm proud of winning
the national title against a player of Greg's quality. It's a pity it
won't help my world ranking. There's a big gap between us but I aim to
close it.''
Henman turned the final on its head to win 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 after
top-seed Rusedski rushed to victory in a 19-minute first set.
It should have been the ideal victory springboard for Rusedski who, at
No.41, is ranked 75 places higher than Henman in the world list. But the
grin that made thousands of female hearts flutter at Wimbledon suddenly
disappeared along with his confidence.
Changes of bandana from white to red to blue could not help either as
third-seed Henman, visibly growing in confidence, piled on the pressure.
''I was struggling with my serve until the middle of the second set when
my rhythm returned,'' said Henman, who missed the event last year after
having broken a leg in a freak accident.
Even Rusedski's big serve disintegrated. He held serve only once in
six attempts and his nine double faults outnumbered his eight aces as he
slipped to defeat against a British rival for the second time in six
months.
''I tried to hit my serve too hard, it didn't come off, and Tim took
advantage,'' said Rusedski. ''He showed a lot of character and he's
definitely top 100 material, probably by the end of the year.''
Henman climbed 22 places on the world list to a career-best 116 after
having won the Korean Challenger event in Seoul last week.
His Telford doubles victory with Jeremy Bates means Henman has
pocketed #16,250 prize-money in a week.
He flies out for a Beijing Challenger event today in a bid to complete
a tournament hat trick.
Clare Wood won the women's crown for the third time in seven years by
defeating Sam Smith 6-2, 6-2.
* PETE Sampras celebrated his return to the top with a stylish,
straight-sets victory over Boris Becker in the Paris Open final.
Top-seed Sampras, who had already done enough in the tournament to
reclaim the No.1 spot he lost to Andre Agassi in April, stayed cool to
counter a determined Becker and win 7-6, 6-4, 6-4.
After a tense first set which ended in a tie-break, the rematch of
last July's Wimbledon final won in four sets by Sampras turned out to be
a spectacular if one-sided battle.
0 The success earned Sampras a #228,000 cheque and 380 ATP Tour points
to give him a clear lead in the world rankings ahead of Agassi, who was
unable to defend the title he won last year because of a muscle strain.
''I'm pleased with the way I played,'' said Sampras. ''I don't think I
can play much better. This win gives me a lot of confidence going on to
Frankfurt,'' he added, referring to the ATP Tour world championship
featuring the world's top eight players which starts late this month.
Becker, who also is in the Frankfurt tournament, said he had felt
helpless at times. ''I did my best but every time there was a key-point,
he came up with an incredible winner,'' he said.

LOCAL BOWLING
DEFENDING champions Prestwick just managed to hold on to their
three-point lead at the top of Division 1 section B of the CIS Insurance
Indoor Bowls League after they scraped home 78-76 against pointless
Balbardie.
Wins from Garry Hood, Edric Vorsterman and Robert McCulloch
off-setting a 27-14 defeat by Balbardie's Billy Arnott over David
Gourlay Jr.
Auchinleck and Lanarkshire remain locked in second place with
Auchinleck edging home by just seven shots in their 84-77 home win over

over last year's beaten finalists Bainfield.
East Lothian also kept their challenge alive after they beat promoted
Stirling 83-62.
In section A West Lothian beat Cumbernauld 84-69 in their battle for
top spot. West Lothian now top the section with seven points closely
followed by Turriff, Aberdeen, Dundee and Cumbernauld all on six.
Turriff, after their double fixture last weekend were without a game
on Saturday while Aberdeen lost their unbeated tag to Dundee when they
went down 79-71 -- although they still have a game in hand against
second bottom Nithsdale.
In Division 2 section C Blantyre snatched a vital 84-64 win over
Portobello and now move one point ahead of rivals East Kilbride who
could only muster a late 71-71 share of the spoils with Midlothian.
Fraserburgh remain unbeated and top section A after a 106-58 away win
over Bon Accord, East Fife move ahead in section B after they beat Alloa
85-59, Coatbridge keep their record in tact with a 99-60 win over

TWO world champions battled through from the weekend playdowns at
Edinburgh for a place in next month's Scottish Friendly women's indoor
national singles championship at Ardrossan.
The current world title holder, Tweedbank's Joyce Lindores, secured
her semi-final place with a 21-5 win against West Lothian's Marion
Halliday, and Auchinleck's Kate Adams, champion in 1994, had a
convincing 21-2 win over fellow internationalist Julie Forrest, from
Teviotdale.
Completing the line-up is Commonwealth Games player Dorothy Barr, from
Ayr, and Jean McFeddries, from the Galleon in Kilmarnock.
Both were 21-19 winners, with Barr beating Jennifer Reid from
Prestwick and Peggie Hunter, from Cowal, losing out to McFeddries.

SCOTLAND achieved a record fifth win in the Hong Kong Classic pairs
when Kenny Logan and Alex Marshall, who only qualified for the knockout
stages by the skin of their teeth, edged out a South African pairing by
19-18 in yesterday's final.
Victory was clinched on the dramatic final end, when skip Marshall
picked up the necessary two shots with the last bowl of the match.
The Scots' victory over Neil Burkett and Danny Piketh -- which
followed successes in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1990 -- came after they only
finished fourth in their preliminary group.
''We had to win our last two group matches against Wales and Ireland
to qualify, and we did that. We just took it from there,'' admitted
Marshall.
The Scots reached the quarter-final stages when they beat New
Zealand's Peter Belliss and Andrew Curtain 20-18 in their final section
match on Saturday morning, and then added a 19-10 win over the
previously unbeaten Channel Island pair of Adrian Welch and David Le
Marquand.
Next in line for the Scots was Phil Rowlands and Robbie Price from
Wales, when a devasting opening burst gave the Scots an 18-2 lead after
11 ends, and they went on to a 24-10 victory.
Scotland's final opponents, South Africa, had already scored a section
win over the Scots and, when they opened up a 14-10 lead at the close of
the fourteenth end, it looked as if the Scots might have to settle for
second best again.
However, four shots on the next end, followed by two more on the next,
gave Logan and Marshall a 16-14 lead, but South Africa hit back to tie
things up at 17-17 with two ends to play.
On the twentieth, Burkett twice killed the end with the Scots lying
and then, on the third replay, dealt a real body blow. With Scotland
lying four, Burkett's last-bowl drive was off target, but he fluked the
shot to take an 18-17 lead into the last.
''I felt then that perhaps it wasn't going to be our day, but it all
came right in the final reckoning,'' Marshall said later.
The Scots skip produced two devastating bowls to win the match. With
South Africa lying, Marshall drove with his penultimate bowl and forced
the holding shots off the green.
Burkett then failed with his last bowl draw dropping short and
Marshall then added the match-winning second with the last bowl of the
final.
''Alex is the best skip I've ever played with -- he was tremendous
during the early part of the week, and even better today,'' said Logan.
Results:
Quarter-finals -- South Africa (D Picketh and N Burkett) 26, Kowloon
Bowls Club (A Pointon and N Kennedy) 14; Hong Kong (W McMahon and D Tso)
24, Zimbabwe (T Dale and M McCormick) 21; Wales (P Rowlands and R Price)
18, Craigengower Cricket Club (T Chok and J Wong) 16; Scotland (K Logan
and A Marshall) 19, Channel Islands (A Welch and D Le Marquand) 10.

ENTERTAINER Marti Caine's husband yesterday thanked her loyal fans for
their kindness and support during her seven-year battle against cancer.
Mr Ken Ives, a theatre director, said: ''I would like to thank
everyone for their concern and good wishes.''
Caine, 50, died in his arms at the couple's Oxfordshire home on
Saturday. She had discharged herself from Bart's Hospital in London
after a sudden relapse.
Yesterday, a steady stream of fans called at the house with their
condolences and flowers for the much-loved funny girl who fought her
illness every inch of the way. No details have yet been fixed for her
funeral.
Her death plunged the world of showbusiness into deep mourning for the
enormously popular character who first found fame on TV's New Faces in
1975.
Fellow comedian Jim Davidson was due to go on stage at a theatre in
Doncaster when he heard the news. He announced her death to his audience
at the end of his act amid tears.
He said: ''She was a really close friend. I worked with her in the
summer and she was marvellous. She was fantastic, everybody loved her.''
Carry On actress Liz Fraser, who has fought cancer herself, said: ''I
recovered from it. It is very sad that she has died after so many years
fighting it and when she looked like she would succeed.''
Faith Brown said: ''When I first saw her I knew she was going to be a
superstar. She just had this wonderful way with her and a certain
twinkle in her eye. Performing was her life.''
Former Opportunity Knocks host Hughie Green said: ''She was one of the
most successful artists ever to come through the talent show ranks. Her
attitude was always 'the show must go on', even when she was at her
complete lowest.''
Veteran comedienne Patricia Hayes added: ''It is a tragic loss.''
Caine was given two years to live after she was diagnosed as having
cancer of the lymph glands in 1988. But she faced the illness head-on
and was back on stage and on television after chemotherapy joking:
''Does that make me a lymphomaniac?''

<HEADLINE>Call for urgent Government funding to provide new building for overcrowded pupils. Rector fears asbestos 'time bomb'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>975519999</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 700 pupils at a Highland school are being taught in a ''ticking
time bomb'', according to their rector.
Fortrose Academy, on the Black Isle in Ross-shire, is over
30-years-old and potentially-lethal sprayed asbestos was used in the
construction of much of the main building, where 70% of classroom
accommodation is located.
The electrical wiring of the school, which is masked by the dangerous
material, is reaching the end of its life and the rector, Mr Douglas
Simpson, fears the consequences of a major fault.
The school is already massively overcrowded as it was built to house
400 pupils. The school remains open, despite its cramped conditions,
because it has been passed for use by the Health and Safety Executive.
However, the asbestos threat worries teachers, pupils, and parents.
The school has had air tests to ensure there is no dust circulating in
the atmosphere, but there is the constant risk of contamination as
damage is frequently done to the asbestos-lined walls of stairwells.
Mr Simpson said: ''The asbestos is safe so long as it is undisturbed.
But the main building is riddled with it and the wiring is needing
urgently replaced. We fear if there is an unexpected problem the school
would have to be evacuated, so the wiring could be accessed through the
asbestos.
''Given the hazardous nature of asbestos dust, the school would have
to close down immediately. Quite frankly, we don't have the space
anywhere else for the pupils and to shut the doors would have a
disastrous effect on the pupils' education.''
There are many other schools in the Highlands needing major attention
but the council can't find the cash.''
Mr Mike Farr, chairman of the school board, said: ''Our nightmare
scenario is that the asbestos will have to be dug out. If the asbestos
became a problem, there would be a crisis. We badly need a new 20
classroom block as an insurance policy against that eventuality.
''At the moment, there is a cautious acceptance of its presence.
Nevertheless, it is a potentially-lethal substance lurking in the
background of the place where my children and another 700 kids attend
every day.''
But Mr Farr was anxious not to allow the asbestos danger to overshadow
the congestion.
''The new block has been designed although there is no start date for
its construction. We are on the financial waiting list and we are moving
up the queue. However, we may run out of time.''
The council needs #11.9m to fund urgent projects but will only get
#3.2m next year.
Mr Jim Stevenson, depute director of education with responsibility for
buildings, said: ''Our priority is to get children out of temporary
accommodation and into proper modern buildings.
''But we don't have enough money to do it and we need more cash from
the Government to solve a problem which is growing every year.
''Never a day goes past without a request from a school in the
Highlands for money for repairs or for additional space.''
The EIS spokesman for Highland Region, Mr Stephen Dowds, said: ''We
are very concerned there is the potential for health and safety problems
for pupils in our schools. Sadly, Highland Regional Council doesn't have
enough money to build new schools or keep up with the growing number of
emergency requests for maintenance work.
''It is clear that the problem is chronic underfunding by the
Government.''

<HEADLINE>Call for hospital changes after baby dies</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975520001</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A TEAM of medical experts is calling for changes in the accident and
emergency department at Berwick Infirmary after a baby died when he was
referred to his doctor because there was no-one at the hospital to
examine him.
Ryan Smith, of Dean Drive, Tweedmouth, died in his doctor's surgery in
the town last month,just before his first birthday.
He had suffered from a heart defect from birth and the inquiry set up
by Cheviot and Wansbeck NHS Trust concluded that, regardless of whether
treatment was carried out at the infirmary or in the GP's surgery, it
would not have affected the outcome.
Ryan had been taken to the hospital by his parents, Gordon and Angela,
when he had become unwell. A nurse carried out an assessment before he
was taken to the surgery but in its report the panel said no physical
examination of the child was carried out and added: ''The significance
of the history as given by the parents and as recorded on the casualty
card was not fully appreciated.
''The panel considers the baseline observations should have been made,
recorded, and transmitted to the general practitioner. It is recommended
that all children under the age of 12, if they are registered as a
patient of the accident and emergency department at Berwick Infirmary,
should have recorded on their record temperature, pulse, and
respiration.''
Only one nurse was on duty in the department at the time and the panel
is recommending that wherever possible there should be a minimum of two.
The trust has been advised to review the roles and training of those
providing care in the accident and emergency department at the hospital.
A nurse has been suspended and may face disciplinary action after it
was discovered the accident and emergency record had been altered
following the baby's death, but the inquiry ruled the action had no
effect on the case.
The inquiry report added: ''The panel were impressed by the facilities
at Berwick Infirmary. They appreciate there are problems associated with
geographical isolation, the nearest major hospital being 50 miles away.
''They also appreciate the fact that the number of patients coming
through the accident and emergency department would not justify the
provision of a resident doctor full-time for 365 days-a-year, such
provision requires a minimum of five medical staff. We do not consider
that the provision of resident medical cover would have made any
difference to the tragic outcome in this case.''
The trust is holding a press conference today to discuss the findings,
which the baby's parents will attend.

ANKARA: Turkish authorities say 55 people have been killed and two are
missing after floodwaters surged through western Turkey. Worst hit was
the port city of Izmir, where shanties were overwhelmed by the floods,
sweeping away small children. In a separate incident, five people were
killed in Isparta after their bus plunged through a bridge weakened by
the rising waters.
* Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller easily won a confidence vote for
her new parliamentary coalition, avenging a defeat three weeks ago. She
will now assume a caretaker role ahead of early elections next month.

Perugia
ITALY'S former Prime Minister indicted today with Mafia mobsters on
murder charges, attacked the decision to send him to trial as
''incredible'' but said the truth would come out.
Andreotti, Prime Minister seven times and Italy's best-known
statesman, was charged with complicity in the shooting in 1979 of
investigative journalist Mino Pecorelli.
The decision to try him with three of the Mafia's most notorious
mobsters was the most sensational to date in a string of trials for
alleged corruption and links with organised crime among leading members
of Italy's disgraced old governing class.
The 76-year-old life senator, who is already on trial in the Sicilian
capital Palermo accused of acting as the Mafia's chief political
protector, said he was not worried.
''Last night I was much more disturbed, and I still am, by what
happened in Jerusalem,'' he told reporters, referring to the
assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
''I think it's all rather incredible, both this Mafia and this
Pecorelli business,'' he told the Italian news agency Ansa.
''However, as a citizen I submit myself to the magistrates' careful
consideration and I trust that in the end, the truth will come out and
will be recognised . . . ''
Examining judge Sergio Materia earlier charged Andreotti, former
Foreign Trade Minister Claudio Vitalone, and convicted Mafia bosses
Gaetano Badalamenti and Pippo Calo with ordering Pecorelli's killing.
Mafia hitman Michelangelo La Barbera was charged with carrying it out.
All five were committed for trial on February 2 at a maximum security
court outside Perugia.
The charges raised the prospect that Andreotti conspired with Mafiosi
to kill Pecorelli because, the prosecution alleges, he feared the
journalist planned to print damaging revelations.
The prosecution case stems from testimony by Mafia turncoats whose
evidence is also central to the Palermo trial.
One informer, Tommaso Buscetta, has alleged Badalamenti told him that
Andreotti feared Pecorelli knew too much about what lay behind the
kidnapping and murder of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro by Red Brigades
guerrillas in 1978.
Andreotti was premier at the time of Moro's killing, one of the
murkiest chapters of Italy's recent past.
Badalamenti, serving a 45-year jail sentence in the United States, has
denied discussing Pecorelli with Buscetta.
Alfredo Galasso, a lawyer for Pecorelli's family, said he hoped the
trial would shed light on the Moro case, which he called ''one of the
darkest pages in our tormented history''.
Pecorelli, whose OP magazine thrived on political gossip fed by
members of the secret services, was shot dead near his office in Rome on
March 20, 1979.
Mafia informers began testifying about Andreotti's alleged part in the
killing and other suspected ties to the Mafia after his Christian
Democrat party's firm grip on power ended when Italy's political
corruption scandals broke in 1992.--Reuter.

Manila
THE Philippines appears to have gone through a ''miniature war'' with
the passage of super-typhoon Angela, which killed more than 500 people
and has left some areas without food and drinking water.
With 280 people still missing, the spectre of starvation loomed as
village heads and rescue workers reported how the ferocious winds and
columns of water had swept away people, livestock, houses, and
ready-to-harvest crops.
''It's like we've been through a miniature war,'' said Interior
Minister Rafael Alunan.
Angela, with a top wind speed of 167mph, smashed through the main
island of Luzon on Friday.
''Farmers will starve unless immediate measures are implemented,''
warned Congressman Bonifacio Gillego.
Farms, where the produce was ready for harvesting next month, were
under 5ft of water in at least five provinces in southern Luzon, he
said.
In Calauag, 100 miles south-east of Manila, survivors were in dire
need of food, water -- and coffins.
Today, the coastal town reeked with the stench of decomposing bodies
as the preservative formalin ran short.
In nearby Malauwin, shocked survivors watched as a priest said a
requiem mass for 26 victims, five of them still without coffins.
Malauwin was the worst hit village with 37 deaths.
Reuter correspondent Ruben Alabastro said the coastal village had so
far received no aid three days after the typhoon.
''When I reached there, people gestured, pointing towards their mouths
asking for food,'' he said.
A disaster agency official in charge of the province said delivery of
food and other emergency supplies was hampered by blocked roads and
washed out bridges.
In the capital Manila the typhoon's aftermath raised fears that the
country's economy, already staggering from an unexpected surge in
inflation, could find the fresh blow unbearable.
Damage to crops, houses, and infrastructure could run to at least 2bn
pesos (#51m). Industry in the Luzon heartland was also expected to be
affected.--Reuter/AP.

Singapore, Sunday
A BRITON charged with murdering and dismembering a South African
tourist is expected to find out this week if he will hang.
Under Singapore law, murder, like drug trafficking, carries a
mandatory death penalty. If convicted and hanged, 35-year-old John
Martin Scripps would be the first Westerner executed there for a
non-drug offence.
Scripps, also known as John Martin, is accused of murdering Gerard
Lowe in a hotel room they were sharing on March 8. Lowe's torso, thighs,
and legs were found floating in black rubbish bags in Singapore's
harbour in mid-March.
Scripps is also wanted in Thailand for the alleged killings of
Canadians Sheila Damude, 49, and her son Darin, 22. Their hacked-up
remains were found scattered across Phuket in March.
Scripps has admitted killing Lowe but said it happened in a burst of
fear after a homosexual advance by Lowe, 32.
Scripps' lawyers are arguing for a reduced charge of manslaughter. A
verdict is likely by the end of this week.--Reuter.

APPROPRIATE environmental planning could create jobs and a better
quality of life in Scotland, according to a new report by Friends of the
Earth.
The results of a study backing the claim will be made at a conference,
Towards a Sustainable Scotland, organised by the pressure group in
Dunfermline tomorrow.
The Scottish project is part of a wider Sustainable Europe Project
involving 29 countries.
The study will present a programme for change to the middle of the
next century, including interim targets for the year 2010. Plans for the
first decade of the century include a 20% reduction in the consumption
of primary metals, chemicals, and building materials, a reduction in
carbon dioxide emissions, and a cut in domestic energy use of 50%.
FoE will also put forward a strategy for job creation and improvements
to the quality of life in Scotland.
Mr Kevin Dunion, director of FoE Scotland, said: ''This conference
will hear, for the first time, the scale of the challenge facing
Scotland if we are to live up to the promises given at the Earth Summit.
''Sustainable development cannot be achieved by greening business as
usual policies. There is no escaping the need for radical change. But
our message is that with appropriate planning, we could generate more
jobs and a better quality of life than by the conventional development
approach.''

Dayton
BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic tonight said he believed the
peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, would succeed, and he welcomed the active
role played by the United States.
In unusually conciliatory remarks, Karadzic said the US-brokered
conference should result in ''the final establishment of peace in
Bosnia''.
The Dayton negotiations were important, he added, because ''they were
initiated by the American side, which for the first time accepted and
recognised the existence of the Serbian entity in Bosnia and the fact
that Bosnia cannot survive as a unitary state''.
Under the peace plan being pursued by the Balkan leaders behind closed
doors in Ohio, Bosnia would be split almost equally between the
separatist Serbs and a Muslim-Croatian federation.
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic is negotiating on behalf of the
Bosnian Serbs, who lost large slices of territory to a Bosnian
government and Croatian offensive this summer.
Karadzic said the US talks should involve the return of a substantial
part of this lost territory to the Serbs.
His optimism about the Dayton initiative was echoed by Lord Owen, a
former international mediator for ex-Yugoslavia, who said in a BBC
interview: ''I think in Ohio there will be peace in the next few
weeks.''
* Bosnia will be split into three military sectors when Nato forces
move in to enforce any peace agreement, Bosnia's vice-president Ejup
Ganic said today.
Ganic said his country would be divided between US, French, and
British-administered military sectors, with overall command from
Sarajevo.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Skye bridge tolls 'could have been half present level'</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DAVID ROSS HIGHLAND CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975520022</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AS organised protests over the tolls on the Skye bridge continued at
the weekend, the economist who first proposed the project has claimed
that they could have been half their present level.
In the comment section of the Highands and Islands Monthly Economic
Report, produced by Inverness-based Mackay Consultants, founding
director Mr Tony Mackay recalls his role in developing the idea of the
toll bridge to Skye but argues it could have turned out differently.
''Mackay Consultants proposed a toll bridge for Skye in a report in
1984,'' he writes, ''which described how various Norwegian islands had
used this system to finance bridges which might otherwise not have been
built.''
Although lower than the ferry fares, the bridge tolls are higher than
Mr Mackay had expected and he suggests three reasons.
''First, the #25m capital cost for the bridge is much more than we
estimated, even taking inflation into account. Secondly, and most
important, we proposed a very different financing system. Based on the
Norwegian experience, where the toll bridges have been financed and
operated by local authorities, we suggested that Highland Regional
Council be responsible for the Skye bridge.
''That would have enabled them to borrow money at a much lower rate
than the private sector. The bridge might also have been eligible for
the European Union's Objective One programme and under that a grant of
50% would presumably have meant that the tolls could have been half what
they are now.
''The third reason for the higher than expected tolls is the high
level of ferry fares charged by Caledonian MacBrayne. It is now clear
from statements made by the company when the existing ferry service
ceased that the Kyle-Kyleakin service was their most profitable route
and in some other respects subsidised loss-making services elsewhere.
''In other words, the Skye ferry fares were much higher than they
could have been, and therefore to the extent to which the bridge tolls
are linked to the previous ferry fares the tolls are higher than they
should be.''
Meanwhile, a police spokesman said yesterday that no-one had been
arrested in Saturday's demonstration on the bridge.
Skye councillor Gavin Scott-Moncrieff, one of the organisers of the
Skye and Kyle Against Tolls campaign, told The Herald yesterday that 200
people had marched in protest and at least 50 cars had refused to pay
the #4.30 toll.
''We do not have accurate figures but would estimate that there must
be between 150 and 250 who have been reported to the procurator-fiscal
for refusing to pay the tolls since the bridge opened. We do not know
yet if he is going to take any action.
''One thing we would like to do is to monitor the number of drivers
who turn back when they find out the level of tolls. We have heard of
quite a number of visitors doing so.''
Local crofters are understood to be considering their own protest,
creating a traffic jam by walking their sheep across the bridge. This
would cost nothing as pedestrians can cross the bridge free of charge.
Eleven seamen, meanwhile, have been dismissed from Caledonian
MacBrayne's outer isles and Clyde ferries to make way for crews of the
redundant Kyle to Kyleakin ferries following the opening of the bridge.
Ferry company chiefs last night denied seamen's claims that safety was
being compromised because the Kyle crews were inexperienced in safety
and maintenance procedures.

Paris
TWO Algerian suspects, including the man believed to be the mastermind
behind a wave of terrorist bombings in France, are behind bars today
after being arrested in London. Scotland Yard confirmed that two men
were detained in central London yesterday.
It is believed that one of them is 36-year-old Abdelkader Benouif,
also known as Abou Fares. The two men are being held at top-security
Paddington Green police station under the Prevention of Terrorism Act,
Scotland Yard said.
The French Government and police oddly failed to fete the arrests of
behind eight deadly bombings in France since July.
The official silence contrasted with the arrests of about 10 people in
swoops in Paris, Lyons, and Lille last week which Ministers trumpeted as
a big step forward in their inquiry into the deadliest wave of bombs in
France for a decade.
Benouif had been under close surveillance for more than a year.
He is believed to be a leading member of the Armed Islamic Group
(GIA), an extremist Muslim group which accuses France of backing the
Algiers military government in a civil war against Muslim
fundamentalists.
The GIA has claimed responsibility for the French bombs, which have
killed seven people and injured 170 since July, with targets including
tourist spots in Paris, a Jewish school, and a crowded market.--Reuter.

Warsaw
POLISH President Lech Walesa made a triumphant comeback in first round
presidential elections today, running neck-and-neck with the
ex-communist he will now face in a run-off on November 19, exit polls
showed.
A television survey found the Solidarity union's former leader had
polled 33.2% of the vote, while Aleksander Kwasniewski was slightly
ahead with 34%.
The other 11 candidates trailed well behind.
The result, confirming the verdict of an earlier poll, signalled a
triumph for Walesa whose pre-poll ratings had consistently trailed
behind Kwasniewski's and whose standing was so low early this year that
he hesitated to run.
As neither won the 50% needed for outright victory, they face two
crucial weeks of campaigning before Poland decides whether to stay with
the former Solidarity chief or elect a man who was once a communist
government minister.
Kwasniewski's aides put on a brave face.
''Considering that practically all the candidates fought against
Kwasniewski, it is a very good result,'' said his campaign manager,
Danuta Waniek. Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski commented: ''I predict a
close run.''
However it appeared a setback for Kwasniewski, 40, an economist who
has presented himself as a modern, pro-Western social democrat devoted
to healing old wounds.
Before the vote analysts had widely expected Walesa, whose often
aggressive style, obscure political manoeuvres, and opaque speech seemed
to be driving many centre-right voters into the arms of rival
candidates, to struggle to catch Kwasniewski.
Yet the result showed he had rallied many of those who stand by the
Solidarity tradition, launched in 1980 when the shipyard worker Walesa
won the right for his free trade union to exist, cracking the grim
facade of communist rule in Europe.
At Walesa's Warsaw campaign headquarters the voters' verdict was
greeted with cheers and the national anthem.
''Until now Walesa has been taking votes from other candidates, but
now it is Kwasniewski who will have to fight to broaden his electoral
base,'' said Lena Kolarska-Bobinska, head of the public CBOS polling
organisation.
''In the second round, the representatives of two forces will face
each other: the former Solidarity camp and the post-communist left,''
she added.
Nobel Peace Prize-winner Walesa has all along insisted he is the only
credible defender standing in the way of a ''Red Triangle'' -- leftist
control of the presidency as well as the parliament and government it
won in 1993 legislative elections.
Several other east European states, weary of economic reform, have
already restored the heirs of former rulers.
''I am the one Pole who has no choice but to stand,'' he declared
during the campaign.
Kwasniewski, vowing to press on with carefully thought-out market
reforms, denies he wants to restore old-style communism.
''Communism is a thing of the past. It is not possible for it to
return and there is no sense in its coming back,'' Kwasniewski told
reporters after voting today.

Tbilisi
GEORGIANS, tired of wars and ethnic violence in their fertile land,
voted today to elect a new parliament and president whom they hoped
would lead the ex-Soviet republic to peace and prosperity.
''I think that this day will decide the fate of Georgia,'' leader
Eduard Shevardnadze told reporters after voting in central Tbilisi.
The former Soviet Foreign Minister appeared to be so sure of his
victory that he planned to go to Israel tomorrow to pay tribute to the
slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
''It is quite possible that he will fly to Israel if the results are
OK and I'm sure they will be OK,'' said Petre Mamradze, a top aide.
Shevardnadze, smiling and accompanied by his wife Nanuli, arrived to
vote in an armoured black Mercedes given to him by Germany after he
escaped an assassination attempt in August.
The only serious rival to Shevardnadze, the republic's Soviet-era
communist boss Dzhumber Patiashvili, accused the government of trying to
intimidate his supporters. However international observers say they have
not registered any serious irregularities.
The separatist Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions boycotted the poll,
but the abstention of slightly more than 5% of the electorate was not
expected to have much impact on the official result. Supporters of the
late President Zviad Gamsakhurdia were also expected to ignore the polls
in western Georgia.--Reuter.

THE public service union, Unison, yesterday called on the Government
to instruct all Scottish NHS trusts to make immediate payment of minimum
3% pay rises to all health workers, and warned of possible industrial
action.
The union said there could be action unless all NHS trusts were
prepared to make the offer with ''no strings''.
Substantial pay awards to NHS trust chief executives in Scotland were
also strongly criticised by the union.
Unison's Scottish head of health, Mr John Lambie, described increases
of up to #26,000 to the chief executives as ''grossly unfair'', while
health staff were offered as little as #208.
''It is obscene that the pay increase of some NHS trust chief
executives will be in excess of the annual salary of certain health care
staff,'' he said.
He added that there was increased pay for those ''responsible for ward
and hospital closures and reductions in service'' at the same time as a
minimum offer was not yet paid to those who were members of the health
care team and provided direct patient care.
Mr Lambie warned: ''Unless trusts are prepared to offer all health
service staff a minimum of 3% without strings, there is every
possibility that there will be industrial action by staff within
individual trusts.''
He said the the Government must intervene and instruct trusts to make
immediate payment of no less than 3% without any unacceptable conditions
attached.
Unison cited examples of high pay increases to trust chief executives
as Grampian (#26,000) and West Lothian (#20,000).
Trusts named by the union as those which had offered pay deals of
under 3% included Paisley (2.6%), Renfrewshire Healthcare (2.5%), and
the Victoria in Glasgow (1%).

A PUBLIC appeal has been launched to raise funds towards the #25m
Institute of Medical Sciences in Aberdeen which will be one of Britain's
most advanced medical research centres.
Phase one of the development is already under construction and is
expected to open in February. The appeal for funds to complete the
project was launched by television personality and Radio 1 disc jockey
Nicky Campbell, a graduate of the University of Aberdeen.
The appeal is part of the Quincentenary Campaign launched to coincide
with the university's 500th anniversary and, so far, more than #15m of
the required #25m has been raised.
The money has come from the university, the local health board,
companies, charitable trusts and foundations, and individuals, including
substantial donations from overseas.
The IMS is sited next to the university's medical school and will
eventually house up to 120 academic staff and 240 researchers.
Research projects will include:
* Studying how the genetic make-up of the individual is responsible
for common illnesses such as asthma, kidney disease, and diabetes.
* Investigating the cause of heart attacks, strokes, and other forms
of vascular disease.
* Using DNA probes for genetic studies into senile dementia and
intractable mental illness.
* Analysis of osteoporosis, backache, hip fractures, and arthritis.
At yesterday's launch, Nicky Campbell tested a new scanning laser
ophthalmoscope which allows researchers to take 3D photographs of the
interior of a patient's eye.
''Family health is everyone's major priority,'' Campbell said. ''There
is a positive need for the Institute of Medical Sciences, which will
develop new treatments for diseases that can affect our children and
grandchildren..''
Throughout November, every home and business in Grampian will receive
an appeal leaflet.

<HEADLINE>Scottish crime up fivefold in 30 years</HEADLINE>

RECORDED crime in Scotland has increased fivefold since 1950, but in
England and Wales the increase has been twice that, a leading
criminologist told the British Association of Social Workers at the
weekend.
Professor David Smith, of Edinburgh University's criminology
department, told the association's Scottish annual study conference in
Aviemore that over the past 12 years the rise in crime in Scotland had
been considerably less than in England and Wales.
Professor Smith was asked if he thought Scotland's children's hearing
system might account for the contrast. He said: ''There is evidence to
suggest that diverting young people from the criminal justice system
does work. If you have a system which diverts young people from the
criminal justice system and gives them several chances before giving
them that label, it is an intelligent way of going about things.
''Retreating from it, as Michael Howard is doing, is a rare example of
irrational, regressive behaviour.''
He added that there was very little evidence to support the idea that
short, sharp shock treatments, such as boot camps in the United States,
were effective in preventing crime.
Professor Smith examined how economic factors affected crime rates. He
said there had been dramatic economic changes in this country since the
war. There had also been a substantial increase in psycho-social
disorders like depression, alcohol and drug abuse, suicide, and eating
disorders among young people.
Most crime was committed by relatively young people and the rise in
crime could be seen as one example of the rise generally of these
psycho-social disorders among young people. Their problems had become
more difficult since the war. The increase in crime could not be seen
simply as a reflection of poverty.
The strongest and most consistent economic growth was during the
''golden era'' between 1950 and 1973 when unemployment was low and
living conditions generally were improving.
Professor Smith said: ''There is no simple equation between poverty
and deprivation and crime. We have to face the fact that the very
striking increase in crime and other disorders occurred during the
period when poverty and unemployment were at a particularly low level
and there was an explosion in economic growth.''
Professor Smith also dismissed the idea that the rise in crime could
be attributed to a collapse in moral standards among today's youth.
''Research suggests the contrary. In many ways, young people are more
idealistic than they were 20 or 30 years ago. They believe, for example,
that the UN should impose human rights on governments and are against
apartheid.
''They also want much more out of life than they used to, and have
higher expectations. They want, if possible, to have a job which fulfils
them and improves the world, but also earns them a lot of money. .''

SCOTLAND rugby captain Rob Wainwright was being hailed as a hero
yesterday for helping to save a man's life -- even though the player
tried to dismiss it simply as ''lending a bit of a hand''.
The new Scotland skipper, who is an Army doctor, had been playing down
his role in coming to the aid of an elderly spectator who collapsed
after suffering a heart attack during Wasps' First Division home game
against Wainwright's West Hartlepool at Hendon in London.
Others however, gave the 30-year-old back row forward more credit than
he would admit to. A spokesman at the hospital where the spectator was
taken said: ''There is no doubt that what he did saved this man's life.
His heart had stopped and Mr Wainwright knew exactly the right things to
do.''
A relative of the patient, who has not been named, said the family
would be ''eternally grateful'' to the Scottish player and they would be
writing to him expressing their thanks. The heart attack victim was said
to be critical but stable yesterday in hospital.
The medical emergency happened 10 minutes from the end of the game.
Hartlepool official Mr Steve Smith said: ''Wasps had just scored a try
when we were aware of something going on in the stand. Rob could see
that someone was in trouble and he immediately raced off, vaulted over
the advertising hoardings, and took control.
''He and our physio Nick Matthews worked on the man for half-an-hour
until the ambulance arrived.''
Wasps manager Malcolm Sinclair also praised Wainwright's swift action.
''Whatever he has ever done on the field of play was surpassed by what
he did on Saturday,'' he said. ''He was a hero in the real sense of the
word. He did a magnificent job and we will never forget that.''
The Scots captain modestly saw things differently, praising
physiotherapist Mr Nick Matthews for doing a great job in resuscitating
the spectator. ''There were a few doctors and paramedics there and I
really just played a peripheral role,'' he said.
Both sides agreed to abandon the match with Wasps leading 24-16. The
medical emergency brought back unhappy memories to the Hartlepool club.
Their lock forward John Howe died after a heart attack during a match in
1992.
Wainwright, capped 17 times for Scotland, was named as international
captain only last week following Gavin Hastings's retirement.

THE elders and minister of the Scots Kirk in Paris yesterday launched
a last-ditch fund-raising effort to save their crumbling church.
The Rev Bill Reid told the Kirk's 50-strong congregation yesterday
that the European Presbytery and the Board of World Mission in Edinburgh
had decided to sell, lease, or redevelop the parish church, which stands
near the Champs Elysees.
Worshippers have been told to join in services at other reformed
churches in the capital.
Yesterday's closed-doors announcement was followed by a special Kirk
session, during which Mr Reid and the elders decided to ask the Church
of Scotland Trust, which meets in February, to reverse the closure
ruling by church authorities in Edinburgh.
The future of the Scots Kirk, rebuilt in 1957, has been the subject of
debate for months. Elders have been campaigning for considerably longer
to obtain money for repairs.
''I am deeply saddened by the situation. The Scots Kirk is an
important part of the life of the British community in Paris,'' said
Brigadier Charles Ritchie of the Royal Scots, military attache with the
British Embassy in Paris.
Mr Reid said he and the congregation had greeted the news from
Edinburgh with ''dismay''.
''The Presbytery did say that retention and repair were a viable
option and we are going to do everything we can to have the decision
reversed and raise money towards repairs. We are doing so with hope, if
not with optimism.'' the minister said.
According to the Paris elders, the Church of Scotland at home has no
capital available for redeveloping the kirk, the sale of which could
raise roughly between #400,000 to #600,000. But even in Paris's
seriously depressed property market, that sum would not be enough to
purchase other premises.
Scots Kirk treasurer Mr Tom Dowie said at least #150,000 were needed
for repairs to the existing structure, of which #60,000 would have to be
spent on urgent work on the roof and the foundations, which are badly
affected by subsidence. An architect has told the Scots Kirk elders that
the building could last ''between 20 and 30 years'' without any more
work being done if repairs were carried out.
Paris elders had met to plan a fund-raising campaign before
yesterday's special session.
Mr Dowie said letters had already been drafted to both individuals and
to heads of major British and foreign firms. That correspondence, he
said, could be sent off as soon as permission to do so was granted by
church authorities in Edinburgh.
Plans to demolish the existing Scots Kirk and redevelop the site as a
place of worship with community facilities floundered three years ago
after neighbouring landlords, whose property would have been affected by
the scheme, withdrew their support.
Mr William MacGillivray, a printer and worshipper at the Scots Kirk in
Paris for 20 years, said: ''Other English-speaking churches in Paris,
reformed and Catholic alike, are flourishing. There has unfortunately
been a long history of decline with the Scots Kirk. It's almost as if
the Church of Scotland had deliberately wanted to run the place down.''
But Church of Scotland officials yesterday insisted that they was
committed to keeping a presence in Paris. The Rev Dr Chris Wigglesworth,
secretary of the Board of World Mission -- which funds ministry by the
Kirk within Europe -- said: ''There is no question of closing down the
ministry or the congregation.
''The Church of Scotland Trust is being asked to sanction the sale of
the existing building at its next meeting in February and we are
exploring the possibility of sharing or hiring buildings.''
He admitted that the existing building could be saved if a developer
came along with plans for the whole site but added: ''We lost an
opportunity to deal with this problem during the eighties when we spent
a lot of money on a development scheme which was aborted''.
The Scots Kirk was denied planning permission for that scheme. If it
were to consider a link with another church, the Eglise Reformee is the
most likely denomination.

THE three former Beatles yesterday launched a searing attack on singer
Michael Jackson for ''cheapening'' their work.
Jackson bought the rights to the Beatles' music for #50m and has
allowed some songs to be used in television commercials.
George Harrison warned: ''Unless we do something about it, every
Beatles song is going to end up advertising bras and pork pies.''
Paul McCartney said Jackson -- with whom he recorded two singles in
the 1980s, Say Say and The Girl Is Mine -- had ''cheapened'' the songs
released.
Their comments came just ahead of the release of the eagerly-awaited
Beatles Anthology album later this month, which will feature the first
new tracks for a quarter of a century.
The three spoke of the ''magic'' of recording new tracks together for
the first time in 25 years and said: ''We could have made them in
1967.''
Free As A Bird and Real Love were both recorded by Paul McCartney,
Ringo Starr, and George Harrison from old tapes started by the fourth
Beatle, John Lennon, who was murdered by a fan outside his New York
apartment in 1980.
But on the two tracks, and thanks to multi-track recording equipment,
Lennon's voice rises from the grave to join his old friends in the Abbey
Road studio.
''We pulled it off, that's the thing,'' said McCartney, who admitted
the three had reservations about whether the reunion would work.
''It was all very strange and very magical,'' he told Elle magazine.
Drummer Ringo Starr added: ''It was great to get back with Paul and
George again although we needed a couple of days to ease into it.''
0    McCartney said it was ''a bit spooky'' hearing Lennon's voice on
a new track but said: ''I think the songs are great and I'm very proud
of them.''

LIBERAL Democrats meeting
for their autumn conference at Dunfermline at the weekend gave
overwhelming backing to the plans for a parliament drawn up by the
Scottish Constitutional Convention.
A handful of delegates argued for rejection of the deal struck by SLD
leader Mr Jim Wallace with Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson,
saying that it would fail to deliver an ideal voting system.
Having carried a Liberal or Liberal Democrat card for 30 years, Ms Sue
Tritten said the additional member system drawing from party lists
severed the link between voters and their representatives and would be a
vehicle for ambitious politicians on the make.
''I hate doing this but I have to ask you to reject all the good in
this document because of this flaw,'' she said. Supporting her, Ms
Elspeth Buchanan said they had to have the courage to reject a flawed
system which would give Labour perpetual rule in a Scottish parliament.
However, the tide was clearly with the party leadership. Convener Ms
Marilyne MacLaren told the conference: ''After generations of misrule
there is now hope that effective, representative government is coming to
Scotland and that we will have a parliament we can all be proud of, one
that is totally different to the Boy's Own world of Westminster.''
Argyll and Bute MP Ray Michie said accepting the plan did not mean
abandoning the fight to make further improvements in the British
constitution, while delegate Mr Richard Pitt said every journey had to
begin with a small step.
SLD Treasury spokesman Mr Malcolm Bruce said the Scottish parliament
would be the first step towards a federal Britain and give the Scottish
people control over the affairs for the first time.
However, the Chief Whip of the Liberal Democrats has thrown doubt on
Labour's Scottish parliament plan, claiming that determined opposition
in Parliament could stop the Bill ever becoming law.
Scots MP Archy Kirkwood has even suggested that the Queen should be
stopped from opening Parliament for up to four years in order to allow
the Bill finally to make its way through Westminster.
At present, all Bills must be completed in each parliamentary year,
which means that all Bills uncompleted by the time the Queen opens the
next parliamentary session auomatically fall.
Mr Kirkwood's suggestion, assuming that Labour or a Labour and Liberal
Democrat pact is in power after the next General Election, is that they
consider just keeping the parliamentary session running, without a
further state opening, until the legislation is completed.
He claimed in an interview on BBC's Scottish Lobby yesterday, that
such a Bill would be so complicated that a dozen determined opponents
could stop it without too much difficulty.
''A Scotland Bill, which is only one element of the constitutional
package that is necessary, is likely to have a 100 or more clauses. Now
you don't have to be a rocket scientist to work out that if you've got a
determined opposition, and the Bill has to be taken line by line with an
infinite number of amendments on the floor of the House of Commons --
there is only 24 hours in every day, there are only 36 weeks in a
Parliamentary session -- and the way that the rules of the House are
currently cast, it would be impossible, even if taking a full year and
even if you did next to nothing else.''
Labour's Shadow Scottish Minister John McAllion said, however, Labour
would be able to get the legislation through the next Parliament if it
had a working majority.
''Labour's commitment to a Scottish Parliament will be a manifesto
commitment and will be supported by every Labour MP in Parliament.''

WORKING women are getting more help at home but still feel heavily
discriminated against at work, according to a new survey published by
the Manufacturing, Science, and Finance union.
The results of the study, carried out among key UK manufacturing
companies, including GEC and Rolls-Royce plants in Scotland, show that
71% of women still believe there is a ''glass ceiling'' over their
promotion prospects and that they are not getting the same career
opportunities as their male peers, even where companies have equal
opportunities policies.
Some 55% of women polled said their partner did an equal share of
housework, especially in the under-25 age group where the figure was
80%.
Of those polled, 86% of computer professionals and 75% of managers
said it was easier for men to get promotion and 56% of women over 35 and
one-third of those under 35 felt they had lost out on promotion.
Some 58% of women claimed they had been subject to prejudice from
their male colleagues and 53% blamed male ''networking'' for excluding
women at their workplace while 55% said their management only paid lip
service to equal opportunities.
Some 84% expressed dissatisfaction with their work and 60% believed
they were not fulfilling their potential.
On the plus side, 60% said there were no sexual harrassment problems
at their workplace although 46% of administrative and clerical staff
said it was still a problem.
Commenting on the results, MSF women's officer Anne Gibson said that,
despite most companies now having equal opportunity policies, an
informal male culture was ensuring ''jobs for the boys'' by producing a
glass ceiling over promotion prospects for women and a window of
opportunity for men. As a result, women were missing out on their
careers.
* Central Scotland, the Highlands, and the Western Isles are among a
growing number of areas where women workers outnumber employed men,
according to the November Incomes Data Services Report, based on the
1993 Census of Employment published last month.
The total of women workers throughout Scotland, 971,300, is fast
approaching the 1 million male workforce.
A similar situation applies throughout Britain where the total female
labour force of 10.39 million is closing in on the male total of 10.72
million.
In September 1993, four Scottish regions saw women's employment
overtake men's compared to two in the 1991 census.
IDS stresses that most female employees are concentrated in the
South-east and South-west of England, South Wales, and Central Scotland.
Strathclyde now has 417,400 women workers compared to 407,500 men with
corresponding figures for Lothian of 173,600 females (167,500 males),
Highland 40,300 (35,700), and Western Isles 5,000 (4,500).
Male employees continue to dominate in Grampian, which with 57.3% has
the highest proportion of male employees.
In Britain as a whole in the two-year period since the last census,
the total number of people in employment fell by 2.2% to 21.1 million.
The brunt of the job losses fell on the manufacturing sector which saw
employment fall by 8.2% while service sector employment increased by
0.6%, leaving just 18% in manufacturing and a massive 75% employed in
the service sector.
This decline in traditional manufacturing industries, together with
the growth in retail, catering, and leisure sectors is seen as the cause
of the shifting sex balance along with job shedding in the defence and
energy sectors and the expansion of the consumer electronics industry
which tends to employ predominantly female workforces.
Over a quarter of workers are now in part-time employment, 22.2% of
them women.

UP to 100 firefighters last night tackled a massive blaze that sealed
off part of Aberdeen city centre.
The fire, in the former Aberdeen Academy, sent flames leaping 100ft
into the air and could be seen from the other side of the city.
Buildings across narrow Belmont Street, on to which the building
faces, also caught fire in the initial stages of the blaze, and at least
two parked cars exploded.
Grampian's deputy firemaster Mr John McCall said his officers put
themselves in considerable danger as they fought the fire. Only 10 days
ago they were called to the same building to extinguish several fires
that police believe may have been deliberately started.
A former church, latterly used as the school hall, was the worst
affected building.
The firefighters were successful in preventing flames spreading to
either side of the former church, which was virtually destroyed.
Some residents and customers of nearby shops and pubs had to be
evacuated as the area was sealed off.
Police said they did not know what had caused the blaze. The area is
earmarked to be developed into a #7m shopping centre.
One of the shops affected by the blaze was the Aberdeen Carers Centre,
opened by the Princess Royal last year and visited by her only last
month.

TONIGHT'S Commons vote on whether MPs should disclose how much they
are paid for consultancy work remains on a knife-edge amid reports that
some Tory MPs will defy the decision if it goes against them.
A number of MPs are said to be lining up to defy the decision, which
could force them into a clash with the powerful committee on priveleges.
However, if enough MPs rebel it cloud be difficult to force them into
line.
Pressure on the Government will intensify this morning with a news
conference involving Labour, Liberal Democrats, SNP and Welsh
Nationalists, Plaid Cymru.
They will seek to highlight the refusal of many Conservative MPs to
vote for the disclosure of all oustide earnings only hours before what
is bound to be a highly-charged Commons occasion.
SNP leader Alex Salmond said last night: ''The only explanation for
Tory MPs' anxiety about disclosure is that they must have a great deal
to hide.''
On the eve of the Commons vote, Tory MP Barry Porter denied any
impropriety over a commercial agreement with a business concern which
approached him 14 months ago to arrange meetings with the Czech
Republic.
Mr Porter, MP for Wirral South, said: ''At the time this was not
unusual and if it had taken place I would have declared it in the
Register of Members' Interests. But nothing actually happened.''
It is claimed that the approach was revived last week and a meeting
was arranged for Tuesday, at which approaches to ministers would be
discussed. Mr Porter said: ''Not a penny, not a halfpenny, not a
farthing changed hands.''
Meanwhile a second Tory MP denied receiving payment for consultancy
services from Mohamed al Fayed, the owner of Harrods.
Sir Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown, said he went with a group
of MPs to see Mr al Fayed at the height of the battle with Lonrho for
control of the Knightsbridge store. The MP said a constituent of his had
worked for Lonrho and Mr Al Fayed said he wanted to see that person.
Sir Andrew said: ''It could be that at that stage a payment was made.
It could have been handed to me but if it was I do not recall anything
at all.''

SCOTLAND'S Jews were in sombre mood yesterday. There was only one
topic of conversation and that was discussed in low, unbelieving tones.
''How could this happen. How could anyone think the assassination of
Yitzhak Rabin could help anyone''s cause?''
Early yesterday morning I was asked by The Herald to write something
about the reaction of Scotland's Jews to this terrible event.
I sat at my word-processor to try to put myself in the minds of my
fellow Jews. I needn't have bothered. For hour after hour I was
bombarded by people who were only too anxious to tell me their feelings.
After the initial expressions of shock the response was incredulity
that such a deed could be perpetrated by an Israeli -- and a Jew. It
goes against every gut feeling.
The mourning of Yitzhak Rabin is as deep and genuine in the Scottish
Jewish community as in Israel itself; it is as much for the loss of that
innocence which took pride in the only true democracy in the Middle East
as for the loss of a great leader.
The immediate Jewish response here was to declare loyal support for
Israel as it faces a new and dreadful crisis. Dr Kenneth Collins,
President of the Jewish Representative Council, a delegate body for all
Scotland, sent a message of condolence to Mr Moshe Raviv, the Israel
Ambassador in London, voicing its ''shocked disbelief'', and
''expressing grief and unstinting support for the achievement of
peace.''
There are a few people in Glasgow who had personal knowledge of Mr
Rabin. The 96-year-old Mr Moray Glasser, who has known every Israeli
leader, recalls first meeting Mr Rabin just before the Six-Day War, and
again not long after his victory. ''He was surprisingly gentle, despite
his fearsome military reputation,'' says Mr Glasser. ''He was clearly a
thoughful and highly intelligent man, careful but determined.''
A special service was organised for yesterday evening to which the
Glasgow Jewish community was summoned by hundreds of telephone calls. A
book of condolence is to be opened at 2pm today, immediately after the
funeral in Israel, at the Israel Information Office, 222 Fenwick Road.
The uncertainty into which the future of Israel has been cast by the
demented action of one young fanatic has greatly disturbed the Jews of
Scotland who have many close connections with that country.
There had been not a little unease at the risks to Israel's security
in the trust being put in Yasser Arafat, a man with a previous record of
implacable terrorism. However, as in Israel itself, the majority opinion
was inclined to support a man like Mr Rabin, as valiant in the pursuit
of peace as he was on the battlefield in the Six-Day War of 1967. It was
Mr Rabin who won the territory which he was now engaged in transferring
back to Palestinian control.
Dr Collins said: ''Yitzhak Rabin was a great leader whose loss as done
grievous harm to Israel and to all Jews beyond that country. While I
know that some elements even here were ill at ease at the ceding of
territory which features in Jewish history, the words of Rabin which
found an echo in our hearts were: 'We are not leaving. We are yielding
-- and we are doing so for the sake of peace.
''Now we are resolved not only to mourn but to demonstrate our
unswerving support for Israel's efforts to achieve a just peaceful
settlement with her neighbours.''
Even the religious elements in the cities here, who have been
unhesitatingly critical of the ''Land of peace'' philosophy, were
forthright in expressions of horror at this mindless act of murder
executed in the name of religious fervour. No one has treated Yigal
Amir, the young perpetrator, as anything but demented. Religion had
nothing to do with this act contrary to every tenet of Jewish tradition.
The reaction of Israelis who live in Scotland does not differ greatly
from that of the other Jews. Mr Yoram Levy, a journalist, finds that his
distress is widely shared, demonstrating the solidarity of the local
community with their co-religionists in Israel. ''It is comforting for
me, so far from home and thinking of my fellow-Israelis, to realise how
strong is the support here. The funeral cortege will pass directly past
my home in Jerusalem.''
Politicians tend not to be too emotional about things for which they
do not have personal responsibility. but it was moving to see on
television and hear on radio the brief pauses and catches in their
throats as they commented on the assassination. President Clinton looked
close to tears as he ended his brief tribute with the words ''Shalom
chaver'' (Farewell, friend).
It is worth looking at the remarks made by Yitzhak Rabin minutes
before his life was ended by the assassin's bullets. He was speaking at
probably the greatest demonstration of public support he had ever
received, His policies seemed at last to have triumphed. ''The Israeli
people has proven that it is possible to make peace, that peace opens
the door to a better economy and society; that peace is not just a
prayer. Peace is first in all our prayers, but it is also the aspiration
of the Jewish people. A genuine aspiration for peace.''
He also said: ''This is a course which is fraught with difficulties
and pain. For Israel there is no path that is without pain.''
These final words could be Yitzhak Rabin's epitaph and they go to the
hearts of Jews everywhere.
Ezra Golombok is a former editor of the Jewish Echo.

FORMER Tory Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath yesterday re-opened
divisions within the party with an attack on the right.
He called on Mr Major to re-establish one-nation Conservatism and said
that if right wingers such as Defence Secretary Michael Portillo did not
like it they should ''get out''.
His comments, however, were rebuffed by Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine, who said that all political parties were a broad church. Mr
Heseltine added: ''All my life I have worked for one-nation
Conservatism.''
Sir Edward said that those who thought like him had to ''stand up and
speak up,'' bringing home to the Prime Minister what one-nation
Conservatism meant.
The public, he said, saw that a minority group was ''in charge and
running the show''.
Singling out Mr Portillo, whose recent conference speech was seen as
being profoundly anti-European, Sir Edward said: ''The chord it struck
was one of horror. Portillo's speech was disgraceful and how he can
remain as Defence Secretary I don't know.''
He told BBC Radio that he wanted the Prime Minister to adopt the
policies that had been Conservative policies for a long time.
Asked whether he thought the right had written-off the next election,
he said he was sure that if the Government did not slash taxation they
would claim they were correct and would ''try to grab the whole party''.

ISRAEL'S unrivalled reputation for tight security lay in tatters
yesterday as security chiefs faced a torrent of criticism over the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.
Security experts emphasised that no-one can guarantee total protection
against the lone mad fanatic bent on assassination.
However, anger mounted after it emerged that Israel's security
services had voiced concern that shadowy extremist right-wing groups
were planning to target political leaders.
Despite the warnings, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was not advised to
wear a bullet-proof jacket and the assassin -- known to the security
services -- was able to push through the crowd and fire shots from just
feet away.
Politicians and the Israeli public, traditionally confident in their
country's impressive security forces, were stunned by the assassination.
El Al, the Israeli state airline, is recognised as the safest in the
world because of its intense security policy.
And Mossad -- Israel's secret service and equivalent to MI6 -- is
renowned for its bold action and ruthlessness.
So the killing is a huge blow to the reputation of Shin Bet, Israel's
internal security police, the equivalent of MI5.
It was disclosed that the head of Shin Bet, who met Mr Rabin last week
to voice concerns for the prime minister's safety, was hurrying back to
Israel from abroad.
''There were obviously a lot of mistakes. There's going to be a big
investigation,'' the official said.
Security had been stepped up around the Israeli Premier with larger
numbers of bodyguards highly visible.
Since he signed the breakthrough peace deal with Yasser Arafat two
years ago, right-wing Israelis have taunted him as a traitor for his
peace moves with the PLO.

Hamilton Accies 1, Dundee 2
SPARE a thought for Hamilton Accies, even if the club -- with no park
or proper training facilities -- perhaps deserves to be dumped
unceremoniously into Scottish football's basement.
They were the whipping boys again on Saturday for a team with more
ambition, professionalism, and an eye on promotion rather than
relegation.
Manager Iain Munro said he was going home to close the curtains, lock
the doors, and not talk to anyone. Maybe he also had a cry, because --
no matter how dire the circumstances may be -- he is sticking to his
principles.
In an astonishing admission, Munro said that Accies would have more
points if he demanded his players adopt a kick-and-rush,
rolled-up-sleeves attitude. However, he insisted: ''They will play
football, and become better players, for that.''
In a week when the gulf between European and Scottish clubs was
exposed, such a stance is admirable, if risky. ''I'm disappointed, not
despondent,'' said Munro.
''My heart goes out to the players. It just seems that any breaks go
against us. We were six inches away from getting a result, but at the
moment we are on the wrong side of that fine line.''
Indeed, his side twice hit the woodwork. Then again, that was
countered by Chris Hillcoat twice clearing off the line as Dundee went
for the jugular.
Accies, still to record a win, sparkled from the start, but the
Taysiders, patient and organised, hit them with a sucker punch in 44
minutes.
After the interval, Dundee threatened a deluge, but, by the end, had
to hang on desperately for the points.
Player-manager Jim Duffy said Dundee had only played for 20 minutes,
which was ''just not good enough.''
He also complained that too many players were off form, although he
praised striker Gerry Britton, who has missed most of the season.
Accies' debut signing, Michael Geraghty, hit a post in 19 minutes and
went close in 25 minutes after intercepting a Neil Duffy header back to
his goalkeeper.
However, Dundee turned the screw, with George Shaw and Neil McCann
having three chances before Paul Tosh's solo effort. Tosh, from the
halfway line, left defenders in his wake, rounded Craig Paterson, and
beat Allan Ferguson with a powerful drive.
Neil Duffy scored in 55 minutes, a diving header from a Tosh drive
that rebounded from Ferguson.
Accies scored in 65 minutes, a Paul McIntosh penalty after a bizarre
McCann pass back forced Jim Duffy to pull down Jim Sherry. The goal was
greeted with a loud cheer, a rare event for Accies fans.
The groans returned in 77 minutes when Martin McIntosh's header hit a
post with Michael Pageaud beaten.

Dunfermline 1, St Mirren 1
GUIDO van de Kamp reckoned it was a classic. Not the match, but the
own goal he and skipper Norrie McCathie contrived to give Saints the
lead after 16 minutes of this match at East End Park.
Saints' Jim Dick punted the ball upfield more in hope of finding
anyone than measured for a mate. McCathie chased back, van de Kamp
hesitated, then came forward, and McCathie nodded the ball gently past
him into the net.
The Dunfermline keeper said: ''It was the classic own goal between
keeper and defender. Neither of us shouted. There was me going back, him
coming forward, then me going forward.''
The goal certainly gave Saints a lift, until they came bearing gifts
at their own end. A David Bingham shot after 54 minutes was blocked and,
in the mayhem that followed, as the Fifers tried to force the ball home,
St Mirren skipper Stephen Watson spectacularly headed the ball past his
own keeper, Alan Combe, from close range.
This spurred the home side and it took a superb display from Combe to
keep out the Fifers, who moved back to the top of the first division
ahead of Dundee United on goal difference.
Saints manager Jimmy Bone was delighted with the 21-year-old keeper's
performance and revealed that Combe had put on two and a half stone
since signing from Cowdenbeath a couple of seasons ago and suggested
that this had helped improve his form.
Striker Barry Lavety came on as a substitute just after the
Dunfermline equaliser for his first top-team appearance since the
revelations of his drug abuse ended with him going for special
treatment.
Bone added: ''It's been a traumatic week for the lad, but he did well
and looked sharp in the reserves in midweek as well as today. If he had
not been, he would not have played.''
Bert Paton, still plagued by injuries to top players -- ''this spell
is driving me crazy'' -- rapped that his team had deserved nothing from
the first half. ''St Mirren deserved their point. We could have been out
there all night and still not have scored.''
Paton, however, was pleased with new signing Colin Miller from Hearts.
The Canadian internationalist signed on Saturday morning in a swop deal
involving midfielder Paul Smith going to Tynecastle.
One of the manager's returning wounded, winger Allan Moore, had to be
helped off just before the end with a hamstring injury, giving Finnish
internationalist Kari Rissanen the briefest of debuts.
Paton added: ''Kari will play in the reserves on Monday night and, if
he does well, I'll consider him for the game at Clydebank next week
before he has to go back to play for Finland against Russia.''

Greenock Morton 2, Airdrie 1
IN a Cappielow show that might have been previewed as Beauty and the
Beast it was hard to tell who was who. Morton were not like themselves.
They were not a pretty picture. Sweetness and light did not come in to
it.
Never did they catch their rhythm. Their customary intricate work
across the park came unstitched. Instead, they stooped to long, loopy
balls from back to front. Beautiful to behold they were not.
From their hamper they had selected other virtues. Hard work and true
grit helped them to a telling victory. A sprinkling of good luck helped
them more.
How well they defended, especially when hemmed into their goal area,
showed what formidable contenders they are.
Often enough John Anderson and Peter Cormack seemed to be working by
instinct and living on their nerves, but survive they did. On an
afternoon when the polish came off Morton's display Derek Collins was a
shining exception.
Although there was not much devilment about Airdrieonians, they
deserved more than only a penalty goal by Kenny Black nearly on the
interval and in between Morton's brace.
If the penalty award was marginal, so was Airdrie's aggression. They
threatened more trouble than they delivered. Making abundant use of
ample space, Paul Harvey several times promised to turn a trick. But
even with the amount of hard work he had to do, it was Black who might
have had the magic.
His jousts with Derek McInnes were crucial and about evenly contested.
Negatively, they produced the free kick from which Marko Rajamaki scored
Morton's first. For the second Alan Mahood had positioned himself with
his usual astuteness to head in a cross by Rajamaki prompted by McInnes.
Because of the fankle his transfer is in, McInnes carried off well his
second definitely last (or, maybe not) appearance at Cappielow. The
vibrant home crowd treated him to another warm hello and cheerio.
Allan McGraw, the Morton manager, picked out Warren Hawke, who was
conspicuous for more reasons than being goalless for once. ''I thought
Warren had his best game, although he didn't score. The good thing is to
see others doing it,'' he said.
* DIEGO Maradona, the Argentinian street urchin turned soccer
millionaire, will tonight speak to the Oxford University Union.
No doubt he will face barbed if politely posed questions about his
infamous 'Hand of God' goal against England during the 1986 World Cup in
Mexico which Argentina won.

Dumbarton 1, St Johnstone 3
THE pressures exerted on those in football were yet again amply
illustrated when the St Johnstone manager, Paul Sturrock, made an
unscheduled entrance into his club's dressing room at the interval at
Boghead.
Only a few weeks ago, Sturrock was stretchered to hospital amid fears
of a heart attack during one of his club's matches and he had only been
allowed to attend on Saturday on the understanding that he sat in the
stand and watched while his assistant, John Blackley, remained in
charge.
However, with his side trailing to a Martin Mooney goal after 26
minutes, Sturrock could not contain himself and he admitted later: ''I
went in, had a quick word, and changed a couple of things.
''I was not supposed to get involved, but it is difficult to take a
hands-off attitude when our first-half performance merited me being
involved. The blend of the team is still not correct and it showed.
''We have not won three games in a row in my time as a manager, but I
would like to see us do that now as we have two home games coming up.''
Certainly, it was a different Saints during the second period -- and
no wonder -- for, in addition to those words from Sturrock, the Perth
players were subjected to a blast from Blackley at the interval.
With Northern Ireland international George O'Boyle, who had shrugged
off injury to take part, looking much more himself, the Perth side
gradually got on top.
Kevin Twaddle, two minutes into the second half, earned the equaliser
with a 20-yard drive.
However, those words of wisdom at the interval could have meant little
but for a penalty kick save by Alan Main, from Mooney, in 57 minutes.
The importance of that was amply illustrated in the next Saints
attack, when a mix-up between goalkeeper Ian McFarlane and Chic Charnley
allowed Twaddle to get his second.
With Saints in control by now, the icing was put on the cake for the
smiling Sturrock when O'Boyle turned skilfully to steer his 10-yard
drive in for the third 20 minutes from time.
Twaddle said: ''Although I got two goals, the game turned on that
penalty save by Alan.
''We were surprised to see the manager at the interval, but he had
come in during the week and gave everyone -- including myself -- a kick
up the backside.
''Then, at the interval, John Blackley also left us in no doubt about
what was expected and told us to get our heads up.''
It was another sad afternoon for Dumbarton manager Jim Fallon, for it
promised much during that first half only to end in disappointment.
''I don't think the penalty miss was the turning point. I reckon it
was losing that equalising goal early in the second half,'' said Fallon.

Jerusalem
''AND on him, Yitzhak son Rosa, known as Rabin, we have permission . .
. to demand from the angels of destruction that they take a sword to
this wicked man . . . to kill him . . . for handing over the Land of
Israel, to our enemies the sons of Ishmael (Muslims).''
This was the curse placed over the head of Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish
mystic shortly before his assassination on Saturday night.
The mystic's call for avenging angels to strike the Israeli Prime
Minister dead was only one of many danger signals on the way to Mr
Rabin's murder, a critical moment of truth for the country's fanatical
Zionists.
Some of them belong to such small secretive Jewish extremist
organisations as the Sword of David, which issued a leaflet earlier this
year saying Mr Rabin was a traitor, who deserved to die for allowing
Jewish blood to be spilled at the hands of Palestinians.
The crossroads for many Zionists had been reached by Mr Rabin's
decision to abandon their dream of a so-called Greater Israel -- the
annexing of the country's occupied territories, including the West Bank,
seized during the 1967 war.
For most of this century, Zionism had been seen as a social democratic
movement, but in more recent years has been hijacked by Jewish religious
fundamentalists.
These groups support the most ardent Zionists, many of whom can be
found among the more than 100,000 Jewish settlers living on the West
Bank, scattered among more than one million Palestinians.
They include Israeli soldiers, who support the settlers' cause. A few
soldiers have been seen to pray at the grave of Baruch Goldstein, an
American Jewish doctor who gunned down 29 Muslim worshippers at a mosque
in Hebron in February last year, before he was killed by Arabs who
rushed to overpower him.
Goldstein, a resident of the Kiryat Arba settlement, on the outskirts
of Hebron, had been a member of Kach, a radical right-wing Jewish group
which called for Israel to become a state governed by Jewish religious
law.
Kach, regarded by left-wingers as a racist Jewish supremacy group, was
founded by American Israeli Rabbi Meir Kahane shot dead by an Arab in
New York in 1990, and since the Goldstein massacre it has been banned by
the Government.
But the organisation is known still to operate as an underground
movement.
A Kach supporter told Israeli television last month: ''Rabin is
endangering the lives of Jews, creating a terrorist state, and taking
severe measures, so he shouldn't be surprised if harsh measures are also
taken against him.''
Mr Rabin must have realised such groups posed a serious danger to the
peace process. The man he appointed to head the country's secret police,
the Shin Bet, earlier this year, is an expert on Jewish underground
groups.
Mr Rabin's alleged assassin is Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old law student
at Tel Aviv's religious Bar Ilan University, where a shadowy group
called Eyal, an anacronym for Fighting Jewish Organisation, with similar
aims to Kach, is based. The group's leader, philosophy student Avishai
Raviv, however, distanced the organisation from Amir, saying: ''We know
him from activities but he does not belong to our unit, and condemn any
such action.''
Some of the Jewish extremist groups, unlike Israel's main
parliamentary right-wing Opposition party Likud, advocate violence. If
necessary, even against Jews.
Likud, while opposing Mr Rabin's policies to transfer self-rule powers
to the Palestinians, has strongly denounced such tactics, and any
personal vilification of the Israeli leader, declaring that Jews should
never kill other Jews.
Militant settlers, though, have demonstrated and staked claim to
vacant hilltop sites across the West Bank territory, in a bid to prevent
the land being handed over to Arabs.
However, their campaign aimed at halting the Israeli army redeployment
from the West Bank, eventually ran out of steam, leaving them
marginalised, and with the grim realisation that peaceful means had
failed to defeat the coming of Palestinian self-rule.

THOUSANDS of Israelis, stunned at a Jew assassinating a Jew, massed in
the heart of Jerusalem yesterday to file past Yitzhak Rabin's coffin.
A vast crowd milled outside Israel's parliament, the Knesset, beside
the flag-draped casket holding the body of their leader.
Sunday and Monday were declared days of national mourning.
''I never in a million years could have imagined that something like
this could have happened in Israel,'' said Mr Sam Aloni, a recent
immigrant from the United States who lives near Jerusalem.
''It was always a risk but we always thought that maybe it would be an
act of terrorism from someone on the outside, not an Israeli, not a Jew
on the inside,'' he said, awaiting his turn to file past the casket.
''That is something I have still not been able to come to grips
with.''
The crowd, carrying flowers and wreathes, spanned Israeli society. The
black hats of ultra-orthodox Jews mixed with a smattering of kefiyah
headdresses of Israeli Arabs.
An Israeli flag lay over the casket, while surrounding flags flew at
half-mast. A sign on top of the coffin listed Mr Rabin's name and rank,
the treatment accorded any fallen Israeli soldier.
Many of those waiting wore the skullcaps of observant Jews -- a
contrast to the claim by the alleged right-wing assassin that he killed
Mr Rabin on orders from God.
''We feel that even though we might not have been 100% for what he
stood for, what happened was a catastrophe and nothing good is going to
come of it,'' said Mr Alon Cohen, who, like the suspected killer, is a
student in his 20s opposed to Mr Rabin's policies.

Stenhousemuir 0, Dundee Utd 0 (AET) Stenhousemuir won 5-4 on pens)
PADDINGTON'S players won the Challenge Cup. Stenhousemuir stepped out
of the shadows and had a wonderful afternoon at McDiarmid Park
yesterday, although their triumph over Dundee United was as nothing
compared with the achievements of their supporters later in the night.
Judging by the body angles of many of them as they made their way from
one watering hole to another, they should have fallen over, but it was a
night when gravity was to be denied as well.
Having waited 111 years for their moment of glory, their first ever
cup win, Stenhousemuir and their fans were determined to have themselves
a night to remember.
Among the unsteady revellers were approximately a dozen Norwegians
from the Oslo branch of the Stenhousemuir supporters club. Their
affinity with the second division club began because of the name,
Stenhousemuir, it is said, means little stone house in Norwegian.
It was probably typical that the club's moment should be delayed by
extra time and then penalties, but after a century without a cup, no-one
with allegiance to the Warriors was complaining. Only United seemed to
be growing increasingly uneasy as time ticked away in a match which was
largely forgettable.
Even before Lloyd Haddow's penalty kick -- the final one in a dramatic
sequence -- had settled in the back of Ally Maxwell's net, he and his
team-mates were racing towards their supporters, who numbered just more
than 2000.
It was a triumph of attitude and stamina more than anything else, and
as he watched his players and fans celebrate, the manager, Terry
Christie, stood with his hands thrust into the pockets of his duffel
coat. A grin took over his face.
He surveyed the riotous scenes before and knew it was all worthwhile.
Football can be an extremely cruel business which rarely allows the
unsung heroes their time in the spotlight, but Christie and his boys
finally emerged.
Not for this manager the designer trimmings. While others of his ilk
are rarely clad in anything other than the club coat with kit designers'
name shown prominently, Christie prefers to look like someone who has
just wandered down to the pitch for a look at the match.
However, this Scottish Challenge Cup win marks him out once and for
all as more than a school headmaster who dabbles in the people's game.
Christie is a manager all right, and it is difficult to think of many
who could get so much out of so many ordinary players. He makes them
believe.
Even though dismissed from the premier division at the end of last
season, United are still regarded as one of the country's major clubs,
as the spending of manager Billy Kirkwood proves. He took the cost of
his purchases to #1m at the weekend when he paid Aberdeen #200,000 for
Ray McKinnon and Celtic #150,000 for Jamie McQuilken.
Christie took on Eamonn Bannon, who was one of the backroom casualties
when Hearts signed Jim Jefferies as manager. Bannon was willing to sign
monthly contracts and pull on his boots again while waiting to find a
way back into management, but the 37-year-old looked like a youngster
again when he ran to celebrate his own successful penalty.
The Ochilview Park side also found their goalkeeper, Roddie McKenzie,
in the junior leagues and although he was not exactly overworked
yesterday, although he made a few excellent saves. In particular, his
leap to touch Gary McSwegan's header over the bar after 108 minutes of
play was spectacular.
Hearts, who have had goalkeeping problems this season, allowed
McKenzie, who is only 20, to go to Blantyre Vics, but on yesterday's
performance he is destined for much greater things. ''I'd say that was
the best game I've ever payed,'' said McKenzie, who was given the
man-of-the-match award, but nothing for style. His choice of garb was a
garish green, white, and orange number.
He made another crucial save at the start of the penalty shoot-out
when he blocked Craig Brewster's attempt and when Maxwell failed to stop
the shots of Bannon, Adrian Sprott, Ian Little, George McGeachie, and
Haddow, the party began. However, Before McKenzie went off to meet up
with his hangover, he revealed his save had come about because of a
misunderstanding.
''Eamonn Bannon told me before the penalty shoot-out that Owen Coyle
always hits the ball to the keeper's left so when I looked up to see who
was taking United's first penalty, I thought it was Coyle. I dived to my
left and saved and it was only afterwards that I realised I had confused
Brewster with Coyle.''
Christie has assembled a team of triers whose strength lies in their
fitness level even though his defensive line is formed by Bannon and two
other old timers, the captain Graeme Armstrong, and George McGeachie.
The trio have a combined age of 112.
''Normally the smaller club can't compete physically with the bigger
club, but Stenhousemuir can,'' Christie said. ''This afternoon is the
highlight of my career in this business.''
Christie and Armstrong have been working together now for a number of
years first at Meadowbank Thistle and now Stenhousemuir and they have
forged a friendship born of mutual respect. ''He's a remarkable person
who can still play the way he does at 39,'' Christie acknowledged.
''We have a lot of good athletes,'' said Armstrong, ''which means we
are never going to be steamrollered by anyone. When the game went to
penalties, I knew we would win. I have been involved in something like
15 shoot-outs with Terry, and we have never lost.''
Yesterday's cup success will keep him, the club and the fans happy for
a long time.

THE American Government has been severely shaken by the assassination.
President Clinton will attend the funeral, with a train of other
prominent Americans, and immediately launch an effort in Israel to
salvage the peace process.
Mr Clinton emerged from the White House an hour after Mr Rabin was
declared dead to tell the people of Israel: ''Just as America has stood
by you in moments of crisis and triumph, so now we all stand by you in
this moment. Peace must be and peace will be Prime Minister Rabin's
lasting legacy.''
Mr Clinton was never so intimately involved in the peace process as
some of his predecessors, notably President Carter, but the signature of
the Israel-PLO agreement, on the back lawn of the White House last year,
was the high point of his presidency.
He presided over that ceremony, and himself prevailed upon Mr Rabin to
shake Yasser Arafat by the hand. It was a historic moment.
Westminster's three main party leaders are heading for Israel for Mr
Rabin's with a clear message from Britain -- the search for peace must
continue.
John Major, in sombre mood, spoke movingly about the assassination of
Mr Rabin, describing him as a man ''utterly determined'' to achieve
peace.
Speaking at Chequers before leaving for Jerusalem, Mr Major said he
would seek to impress upon the new Israeli premier, Shimon Peres, the
need to carry this work forward.
A ''deeply saddened'' Mr Major said the assassination was a great
tragedy, not only for Mr Rabin's family, but for Israel and the Middle
East as a whole.
''Everyone wants the peace process to continue and to be successful,''
he said and Mr Rabin would have wanted what has happened to give it
momentum in the future.
''I found him a man utterly determined to proceed down the path of the
peace process, despite the short-term difficulties . . . he believed
there was a great historic opportunity for peace and he was determined
to take it.''
Labour leader Tony Blair said he believed Mr Rabin's work would live
on and the march to peace would prove ''unstoppable''.
Mr Blair said: ''Yitzhak Rabin was a brave man leading his country to
peace. Just as we salute his courage so we condemn the cruelty of his
assassin.
''Though they have taken his life, they must not be allowed to take
peace from the people of the Middle East. We can best honour his memory
and his life's work by redoubling our efforts to support the peace
process.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown declared: ''It is vital that
everyone now acts to keep the peace process on track.''
The Queen sent a message of condolence to Israel's President Ezer
Weizman expressing ''profound sympathy''.
The Queen's message, sent from New Zealand where she is touring, said:
''I was horrified to hear the news of the murder of your Prime Minister.
The Duke of Edinburgh joins me in sending to you, to your Government and
to the people of Israel our profound sympathy. Please extend also our
heartfelt condolences to Mr Rabin's wife and family.''

UEFA are considering a proposal to change the Champions' League format
once again to ensure that leading clubs have a chance to remain involved
in European competition.
President Lennart Johannson revealed over the weekend that those clubs
eleminated in the preliminary round of the Champions' League could be
placed in the UEFA Cup as compensation.
Johannson said: ''Plans are at a very early stage, but I know that I
am not happy that big clubs go out before the competition is under way.
''These are the names which are so attractive to the European public.
They should see the best in the best.''
Such a move from the most powerful figure within UEFA could ease the
considerable pressure for a European Super League.
Rangers, who fell at the first hurdle last season, as did Anderlecht
this season, going out to Ferencvaros, would be two such clubs Johannson
has in mind to benefit.
The Belgian club's president Constant Vandenstock insisted: ''UEFA are
afraid of the day that clubs will break away from their current set-up.
''For teams like ourselves, Brondby and Glasgow Rangers, it is vital
that we have a protracted run in Europe to justify the investment in our
teams.
''We are all big clubs in small leagues. If it were only national
titles we sought, then we could cut our spending by half and still win
them.''
* DICK Jol, one of Holland's top referees, has been suspended after
allegations that he rigged matches in which he officiated.
Jol is claimed to have wagered substantial sums on correct scores. An
investigative TV programme, tipped off anonymously about the bets,
filmed Jol entering a bookmakers.
One game between Groningen and Feyenoord is under particlular
scruntiny. It ended 1-1 and Jol was seen to reject two clear penalties.
The allegations took on further substance when his former wife went
public and stated Jol was an inveterate gambler who had bet on matches
he controlled.
* IFK Gothenburg are the new Swedish champions for the sixteenth time
in their history. MyPa, UEFA Cup conquerors of Motherwell, have won the
Finnish Cup.
* GREMIO, of Brazil, will break off from their relegation struggle to
contest the World club championship against Ajax in Tokyo on November
28.

Hearts 3, Partick Thistle 0
JIM Farry, the SFA's chief executive, who is proud of the progressive
reputation his administration enjoy within the corridors of UEFA, says
Scots should not press the panic button because of another miserable
European experience.
Now, I don't know about you, but I'd rather be lauded within the
corridors of power because of the forward-looking nature of our football
rather than any abilities to write letters, and if Farry and his people
had been at Tynecastle on Saturday, they might have discovered how poor
our play has become.
Hearts, who had been struggling at the bottom of the premier division
with only two wins from 10 matches, were desperate and they signed two
more foreigners, Italian defender Pasquale Bruno and Hans Eskilsson, a
Swedish front-line player. With Frenchman Gilles Rouset in goal, Jim
Jefferies' side looked sharper than at any other time this season.
They beat Partick Thistle comfortably, scoring three times, while a
defence which had been leaking goals looked more commanding. Thistle's
scoring opportunites were restricted and, in fact, they contributed
little to the afternoon.
Afterwards, Bruno, who had come to Gorgie for a look with the
possibility of signing untill the end of the season just as Rousset did
the night before the match, unwittingly provided a withering verdict on
Scottish football. The Italian, who has known highs with Torino and
Juventus, said the most difficult problem he encountered on Saturday was
with his boots.
''They were too tight,'' said the defender, who changed his footwear
at half-time and continued to stroll through the remainder of the match.
''I like this football,'' he added.
With the Tynecastle faithful chanting his name even though he hadn't
done much, he would like Scottish football, wouldn't he? Bruno, 33, and
seeking one final challenge, said Juventus's Gianluca Vialli and Roberto
Baggio, now of AC Milan, harbour desires to play in British football,
but he has made it to these shores first.
However, it is doubtful if Hearts, who have persuaded him and
Eskilsson to play three matches with a view to signing a longer deal,
would have been able to take a look at him if his style of play had not
made him something of an outlaw in Italy. ''I have a problem with the
red cards,'' he said.
Bruno was suspended so often he should have had a parole officer, but
Scottish football, he suspects, might just be his natural environment.
''Today was the maximum for me,'' he said. ''The fans were fantastic and
chanted my name, while we also won the battle.
''In Italy, the players like to play the ball, while in Britain the
fans like the battle and the ball is played longer. Here, we have real
football. There is no diving and the trainer doesn't come on to the
pitch too often.''
Bruno, a bright, effervescent sort, would be good company if he didn't
keep offering reminders of how out of touch our style of play is, but if
his wife and two daughters like the thought of living in the Edinburgh
area, Bruno ''would rent a flat here tomorrow.''
He has gone home to discuss the matter with his wife, but Jefferies
and Hearts fans, who have suffered because so many key players --
McPherson, Levein, Frail, Thomas, Leitch, and Pointing -- are injured,
want to see him back. ''Bruno is one of the best defenders I have
seen,'' the manager said.
Jefferies also was pleased with the contributions of Rousset -- ''He
doesn't look as though he will lose many goals'' -- and he was delighted
with the work of Eskilsson when he ran on to replace Alan Lawrence in 59
minutes. The Swede had scored Hearts' third goal within 10 minutes.
''He isn't the most technically gifted player in the world, but the
big Swede certainly gives everybody a lift,'' Jefferies said.
Eskilsson, with his long, curly hair flowing behind, doesn't bother
too much about subtlety and he seemed to scare Thistle's defenders, who
were already having an unpleasant time. Derek McWilliams scored an own
goal after 10 minutes and it was downhill from then.
John Millar finished off a sweetly constructed goal involving Alan
Johnston and Steve Fulton by heading in the second in 65 minutes, and
Thistle were looking sorry for themselves. Actually, they were a
disgrace, and the last thing they needed was a huge Swede charging
around in the latter stages of a match they just wanted to end.
Although the fans were busy welcoming Bruno, the best player on the
pitch was Johnston, who was out on his own in the second half. Johnston,
22 next month, was elusive and his exquisite touch sent balls through
Thistle's defence. He also appeared to be more aware than anyone of what
was going on.

SUCH is the intensity of competition for places in the Huntly attack
that striker Gary Whyte remains uncertain of his prospects of playing
next week -- despite having scored four goals in a 17-minute spell on
Saturday.
The lanky former Forfar player was back to his best after injury as
Huntly enhanced their superiority at the top of the table with a 4-2 win
against Clach.
''For all I know, I could be dropped next weekend,'' said Whyte.
''Competition for places in the Huntly team is intense at the best of
times, but up front it is incredibly tight.
''It is all very well scoring four in a game, but you can't be
complacent -- there are no shortage of proven goalscorers waiting in the
wings. I've shaken off a couple of niggling injuries and it's good to be
back. But the manager could have other ideas next week.''
Another deadly Huntly marksman, Martin Stewart, is expected to resume
training tomorrow and has a knack for making speedy comebacks.
Whyte, however, is determined to keep the goals coming. ''I felt I
could have had three or four in midweek,'' he claimed, ''but it just
didn't quite fall for me. It was great to see it happen against Clach.''
Winger Marco de Barros supplied two of Whyte's headed goals, a third
came from the spot, and the other on the rebound after Clach keeper
Donnie Munro has saved his first effort.
Clach could have been forgiven for collapsing under the weight of the
Huntly bombardment, but fought back bravely in the second half with
goals from Stuart Golabeck and Bruce McCraw.
Huntly stayed four points clear in the title chase, but now have a
game in hand. Cove Rangers capitalised on slips by Peterhead and Keith
to leap into second place with a 5-1 demolition job at Buckie.
Half-time substitute Duncan Ord was the hero as Elgin snatched a
surprise win at Keith. His second-half double was all that separated the
sides.
Struggling basement club Nairn County made a stunning second-half
comeback to win 3-2 at home to Rothes after trailing 2-0.

THE man police say killed Mr Yitzhak Rabin did not fit the usual
profile of an assassin: a religious Jew and son of a scribe, Yigal Amir
was studying law in university.
At 25, he had no criminal record. Police said he had even served as an
emissary doing some unspecified task for Israel in the former Soviet
Union.
After his arrest, Amir admitted to twice planning to kill the prime
minister and told police he would have shot Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres if the two leaders had left the peace rally together.
''I acted alone on God's orders and I have no regrets,'' the radio
quoted Amir as telling police.
He claimed Mr Rabin and the government were leading Israel to another
Yom Kippur, an apparent reference to the 1973 war in which Israel
suffered heavy casualties.
There was at least one sign of violence in his past. Amir was reported
as having been detained this year during a confrontation between
settlers and police in the West Bank. Police would not comment on an
army report that a brother was being held.
His father hand writes holy scriptures, and his mother a nursery
school teacher. He is the second of eight children.
Police said Amir travelled to the rally by bus from his home in a Tel
Aviv suburb, waited in the car park, and as Mr Rabin was about to enter
a car, fired two shots into the Israeli leader.
At the rally, Mr Rabin had said: ''This is a course which is fraught
with difficulties and pain. For Israel there is no path that is without
pain.''

Kilmarnock 5, Raith Rovers 1
A FEMALE member of Kilmarnock's staff showed Jimmy Nicholl to a seat
at Rugby Park before the ball started bouncing. The Raith manager looked
unsure, ill at ease with her selection, and later made his own
arrangement.
Throughout the remainder of the afternoon more Kilmarnock employees,
the ones with hairy legs, enjoyed themselves enormously as they put
Nicholl's finest in their place on the grass with what looked like
consummate ease.
Of course, it would be in a way understandable to be enveloped with
the idea that the players from Kirkcaldy were drained having just
returned from pitting their footballing skills against Bayern Munich in
a UEFA Cup fixture, but this is a thought with which Nicholl will have
no truck.
''You don't expect that sort of result after how they played during
the week,'' said the manager, ''but it's for sure that outwith the
European games, the fact is that our league form is awful.''
It seemed that the supporters in light blue and white had hardly taken
up a comfortable position in their seats from cheering one goal when
they were up again, as another of their heroes had tucked the ball past
Scott Thomson, coming close to doubling the club's league goals tally
for the season in one match.
Words like ''wonderful'' and ''fantastic'' were heard coming from the
lips of ones wearing Kilmarnock favours as they trooped from the
stadium, but it is unlikely the Ayrshire club, or anyone else, will find
Raith Rovers in such dreadful form in future.
After John Henry and Paul Wright had scored two goals each with
another from Tom Brown, one could have been forgiven for believing that
we had seen enough excitment for one afternoon and that all the fun was
over. But Kilmarnock keeper Dragoje Lekovic is a good sport and decided
to enliven the proceedings further by handling the ball outwith his area
and was rightly dispatched indoors.
It is a proud tradition that keepers throughout the planet are not
like the rest of us, a strange breed with ideas and actions more
normally seen in those confined to small rooms which lock from the
outside and have heavily padded wallpaper, and Lekovic's sudden rush of
blood to the head when little danger immediately threatened did seem a
little unnerving.
Alex Totten, the Kilmarnock manager, in his wisdom, had decided not to
include a substitute keeper, so when a volunteer was called upon to be
the last line in defence, Gus McPherson's hand shot up and was duly
handed the gloves.
''I don't know if I would have been so quick to volunteer had it been
1-1 at the time,'' said McPherson, ''but 5-1 up I didn't mind.''
As Raith, whenever possible, fired the ball at McPherson, who between
the posts and surrounded by many tall defenders had more the stature of
a jockey, he rode his luck well enough for the two scoreboards to enter
into the merriment by informing the audience: ''Gus, Scotland's No.1.''
Oh, they do know how to celebrate the good times in North Ayrshire,
not that they have been in plentiful supply of late, but perhaps the
tide will now flow in their favour. With the excitable support that
Kilmarnock can drum up on a Saturday afternoon, it is fitting there is
an end result worth working up a lather about.
But as chairman Bob Fleeting perhaps would have needed the juice of a
large lemon to eventually banish the grin from his face, Totten, after
his side's biggest win in ages, found it impossible even to smile about
his men's work.
''Kilmarnock deserve a bit of praise now,'' the manager almost
insisted, adding that excuses may have been forthcoming in the past for
teams to have been somewhat jaded against his men for various reasons,
but Totten dismissed such talk at the weekend as scurrilous.
Meanwhile, it is hoped that Jimmy Nicholl found a comfortable seat on
the coach for the long trip home. He had much to ponder.

A SPECIAL Cabinet meeting scheduled for today has been cancelled after
Ministers agreed on next year's public spending round.
A Cabinet meeting on Thursday ended in deadlock leaving Prime Minister
John Major with the problem of whether he could achieve the reductions
needed to produce tax cuts in the budget this month.
However, the weekend negotiations between the Treasury and the
departments where there were still problems to be ironed out have
resulted in a deal being struck. A Downing Street spokesman said
yesterday: ''All the substantive issues have now been settled.''
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was heavily involved in the
negotiations at Chequers. He had been planning to speak at a conference
in Glasgow yesterday but flew south to argue his case that the current
spending formula for Scotland be left intact.
Since he went on record in the summer as saying this would only be
changed ''over his dead body'', losing the battle over the
Goschen-Barnett formula would leave his political credibility in
tatters.
The formula gives Scotland a guaranteed budget of 10.66% of any new
money given to the national spending Ministries, which in past years
meant that the Scottish Secretary has not had to fight his corner during
the spending round.
London newspapers have claimed that this battle has already been lost.
The Daily Telegraph last Monday suggested that Treasury hawks were
closing in on the Scottish Office budget as part of savings to free
money for tax cuts, but this was quickly denied.
But at the weekend the Financial Times quoted Treasury sources as
confirming that Scotland's share of the public spending cuts would be
heavier than for those across the board at Government departments.
Another allegation in that story was that during his days as Scottish
Secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind had made the preservation of the funding
formula a resignation issue.
If, as suggested, #600m is to be slashed at St Andrew's House, it is
difficult to see how Mr Forsyth could claim that the Barnett formula has
been left intact and opponents would argue that he has no choice but to
resign. It will mean that cuts in Scotland will range from 9% to 15%,
whereas cuts south of the Border would be limited to 5%.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson remained reluctant
yesterday to capitalise on Mr Forsyth's difficulties, suspecting the row
might yet be a mechanism to enable him to emerge ''looking like Santa
Claus'' if he escaped the worst.
SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond said: ''Either Michael Forsyth is engaged
in an elaborate charade with the aim of presenting himself as the macho
champion of Scotland's interests, or his fiddled figures about Scottish
income and revenue are being used against Scotland by Tory right-wingers
who want to deliver tax cuts for England by sucking Scotland dry.''

Aberdeen 1, Hibernian 2
AT the end of a week of despondency for Scottish football, Aberdeen
and Hibs provided an entertaining spectacle by national standards, and
although he was on the losing side, teenager Stephen Glass provided hope
for the future.
He shone for the Dons and Kevin Harper, the dynamic young Hibs
striker, showed his potential although his performance was marred by
poor finishing.
Jim Leighton has not got youth on his side but his maturity and
experience assist him to outstanding performances. He left his former
Aberdeen clubmates in disbelief at some of his saves, and Theo Snelders,
in goal for Aberdeen following an injury to Michael Watt who has been
the recent first choice, also was superb.
The battle between the two clubs who are in pursuit of the Old Firm
was won by Hibs by soaking up the pressure which Aberdeen exerted for
most of the match, and capitalising on two of the many chances they
created on the break to earn their three points. Aberdeen's reward for
their pressure was a single goal.
They got off to a positive start and dominated early, but midway
through the half things started to go wrong. First, a poor Grant
back-pass left Snelders in trouble wide of the goal, and he managed to
clear only as far as O'Neill who fired the ball back towards the
unguarded net. The keeper just got there in time, but his defence
abandoned him a few minutes later, allowing Keith Wright a near-post
header from a free kick to put Hibs ahead.
O'Neill gave Harper a great chance to put the Edinburgh club two up
just before half-time when he sent him clear, but Snelders raced out as
Grant snapped at his heels, and that was enough to force Harper to make
a shot which the keeper pushed wide.
Aberdeen had drifted out of the game and had forsaken their flowing,
skilful build-ups for wallops up the park which gave Hibs possession.
A few choice words at the break from manager Roy Aitken worked a treat
and the Dons started the second period with new commitment, and after 53
minutes Glass equalised.
There seemed little danger as he moved towards the box from the left.
but when the Hibs' defence parted he saw his opportunity and unleashed a
tremendous low, swerving 25-yard shot which went beat Leighton.
Hibs continued their counter-attacks and Snelders did well to touch an
O'Neill shot on to a post. Leighton admitted later he wondered if
anything would beat Snelders after that. O'Neill was determined to find
out. A few minutes later he weaved past three defenders and as he
approached John Inglis, the defender stumbled, O'Neill skipped past and
rifled a 25-yard shot low into the net.
Alex Miller praised his players but went on to express the view that
Scottish footballers are a long way behind the continentals in many
aspects.
''It is no good talking about the standards of football in Scotland
and not doing anything about it,'' said the manager. ''We as a club have
to do something about it and so have other clubs.
''Like it or not we are behind the continentals in relation to passing
the ball and keeping it. They have so much time and the reason they have
time is they don't all run in front and show their backsides.
''People are deeper to the ball and they have a patience and seem to
have confidence in their own ability. You see Scottish players running
at times with their neck muscles sticking out, and you see the
continentals bringing the ball down with the back of their heels and
things like that, just because they are relaxed and confident.''
Jim Leighton believes his team-mates have got more ''steel and
resolve'' this season and are determined to secure victories and not
settle for draws.
''In the second quarter of last season we had seven draws, five of
them goal-less, and what a difference it makes when you turn one point
into three.''
Roy Aitken pinpointed Aberdeen's problem: ''We have got to turn our
dominance in games into results.
''We have dominated two or three games this season which we haven't
won, in fact we have lost. We have to recapture that ruthless streak,
defensively and front of goals. They have to sacrifice themselves as
individuals to get a result. It is a frustrating game and I cannot fault
them in the main for their effort but we need that extra bit.''

THE Latin temperament was shown to good, or perhaps bad, effect in

Roberto Mancini, never the most even-tempered of individuals at the
best of time, threw down his captain's armband and threatened to walk
off after having been booked for diving in the penalty area.
When persuaded to continue by his team-mates, Mancini was then
promptly sent packing by the match referee for dissent.
It was a bad day for Juventus, who fell six points behind the pace
after having slipped to their second successive league defeat at
Udinese.
German striker Oliver Bierhoff scored the only goal of the match after
74 minutes to inflict on Juventus their third league defeat of the
season.
Goals from Paolo Di Canio and Gianluigi Lentini set AC Milan on their
way to a 3-2 home victory against Cagliari. The win kept Milan level at
the top of Serie A with Parma, who defeated Cremonese 2-0.
In Belgium, league leaders Brugge remained a point clear of Anderlecht
when both sides won their weekend matches 3-0.
Two goals from Dely-Valdes set up Paris St Germain for a 3-2 success
against Nice, with the Brazilian, Rai, netting the other Paris goal. It
took them to the top of the French first division after surprise early
leaders Metz lost 1-0 in Bastia.
In the Rotterdam derby in Holland, two goals from Feyenoord's Ronald
Koeman could not prevent Sparta winning 3-2 at home.

Motherwell 0, Celtic 2
ON the weekend after his manager had made the post-depression point
that senior players could work at their skills just as much as the
younger men, Peter Grant, Celtic's 30-year-old midfield man,
demonstrated that you can teach an old dog new tricks.
Grant, better renowned for his steely grit than his finesse, did the
simple thing all through the 90 minutes and in the process illustrated
that, in essence, the game remains as it has always been --
uncomplicated and straightforward.
The Celtic midfield player passed the ball to a team-mate virtually
every time he was in possession. In the entire game, I think he made one
error, giving the ball to an opponent.
The consequence was a series of passes, some lengthy, most short,
which put one of his colleagues on the ball, a strategy which, if
carried on by the others in a team, leaves the opposition struggling to
get a game.
I suppose that is over-simplification, maybe far too obvious, but
Grant thrived on the rediscovery of that basic tenet. He enjoyed
himself, too, and conserved a good deal of energy along the way.
It was mainly due to his control of the pattern that Celtic were able
to subdue Motherwell, particularly in the second half, when they turned
on a performance that epitomised the requirements of winning in the
premier division. Grit, determination, pace and some competent one-touch
play were there in good supply and, if we accept that it was not
remotely close to top European standards, exciting enough in its way.
Examined closely, Celtic's style does reveal a serious attempt to work
towards a better standard, with players aiming at build-up from the back
and quick-fire one-twos against packed defences. It is difficult to
implement in the manic pace at which our game is played, but it has to
be tackled if success of any sort can be achieved beyond the borders of
Britain.
Grant and his team-mates have less exalted ambitions for the moment.
''Our ultimate goal is the championship, there is no doubt abut that,''
he said. ''Winning the Scottish Cup got the monkey off our back but, for
me at least, preventing Rangers winning eight or nine championships in a
row is the priority now.
''I for one was jealous of Rangers playing in the Champions' League,
even if they did get turned over. We want to be taking part in games
against teams like Juventus. People like Paul McStay and myself are not
getting any younger and we may not get too many chances.
''I am not dodging the fact that I am also a Celtic supporter and we
don't want to see Rangers pass our club record in the championship.''
Despite their own defeat by Paris St Germain in the Cup-Winners' Cup,
Grant maintains that there is a different air about Parkhead these days.
''We know we still have a bit to go, but the attitude is definitely much
better. The young players say they get a lift from us older men, but we
also get a lift from them.
''Everybody is desperate to get in the side just now and it is a long
time since you could say that at Parkhead. The manager says he will
bring in new players, but right now they will have to work hard to get a
place.''
There is a fair journey to be made yet, as Grant said, but it does
begin to look as if his team will offer their most serious challenge to
the champions for many seasons. Beating Motherwell was rare for a start,
not having been achieved since Burns and Billy Stark took over. Winning
away games that they would have drawn in the last couple of seasons is
also indicative of progress.
Burns expects much from McStay and Grant. ''They are at an age when
they should be dominating games for us. I thought they were superb and
Andreas Thom looked more like himself.''
Maybe the most encouraging aspect was the form of Simon Donnelly, who
has kicked his career into top gear again and gains in confidence wih
every outing. In an era when players willing to take on defenders are
rare commodities, Simon is to be nurtured carefully, but he has a
manager who takes that viewpoint anyway.
Motherwell have had a rough ride this season, unlike their impressive
performances of last term, but manager Alex McLeish could justifiably
point to a series of injuries that have hampered his selection.
He did not want to dwell on that aspect after the game, rather he was
more positive about the way his side had tackled the first half. ''I was
disappointed in that we gave Celtic too much respect in the second half.
We sat back and let them dominate the midfield,'' he said.
McLeish, who had to do without the injured Tommy Coyne, has another
casualty to count out for tomorrow's game with Hearts at Fir Park,
defender Eddie May, who had only just returned to the team after a
previous knock. May has a hamstring problem.
The full back had been at the centre of the main talking point of the
first half when he clearly impeded van Hooydonk as he rose to meet a
superb Thom cross. Mr Clark seemed to be the only person in the ground
who saw nothing illegal.
Celtic eventually got the goal they were due when Donnelly headed in a
McKinlay corner, and they could easily have had a couple more,
especially as Thom chipped over the keeper and hit the bar and van
Hooydonk saw a header cleared off the line by Billy Davies.
However, John Collins, who replaced Brian McLaughlin, hit a wonderful
clincher in the last minute.

NEW Prime Minister Shimon Peres led the tributes to Yitzhak Rabin:
''We accompany a great friend, a great leader, a great Jew, a great
fighter, a man who pursued peace and achieved it, a man who brought
peace to new heights.
''He didn't make a final testament but the last song he sang (at the
rally) was the Song of Peace. He put this song in his pocket and the
bullet went through this song. The song of peace ringing in our ears
will not end.''
''THE world has lost one of its greatest men, a warrior for his
nation's freedom and now a martyr for his nation's peace. Yitzhak Rabin
was my partner, my friend. I admired him and I loved him very much.
Because words cannot express my true feelings, let me just say shalom,
goodbye friend,'' -- US President Bill Clinton
''THIS cowardly murder struck a man who wanted to achieve peace in the
Middle East through great courage and the full commitment of his
personality. I know from the countless talks I had in the past few
months with Yitzhak Rabin that he recognised the danger for his life.
''But it was important for him to use every chance to finally create
peace for people in a region so marked by sorrow.
''Germans mourn along with his wife, his family, with the Israeli
people and all peace-loving people in the world,'' -- German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
''I PERSONALLY have lost a true friend in this region and our world
has lost a true champion of peace.
''I shall always remember him as my dedicated colleague and fellow
shepherd of the Jordanian-Israeli peace process.
''Yitzhak Rabin will forever be remembered and respected as a symbol
of decency, integrity, and courage. He was a soldier who fell a martyr,
a true soldier of peace and since life is but a journey, his legacy will
ever be a most worthy and honourable one,'' -- King Hussein of Jordan.
''I AM very sad and very shocked for this awful and terrible crime
against one of the brave leaders of Israel and the peacemakers.
''I hope that they will have the ability, all of us, the Israelis and
the Palestinians, will have the ability to overcome this tragedy against
the peace process and against the whole situation in the Middle East,''
-- PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
KING Hassan of Morocco said he had lost a personal friend in Mr Rabin,
who once came to Morocco for secret talks wearing a wig long before
other Arabs made peace with Israel. The king felt ''close to the Jewish
people and on a personal level, he had lost a friend''. He considered Mr
Rabin ''a pillar of the Middle East process and a great leader''.
THE assassination would not still Mr Rabin's vision of peace in a
fractious region. ''Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin will always be
remembered by all of us for his unshakeable belief and effort toward
providing peace and compromise in a region full of conflicts,'' Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel.
''HE was an outstanding statesman whose name will go down in
history,'' -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
''YITZHAK Rabin will, in our Jewish phrase, be one whose memory will
stand as a blessing, and the cause for which he dedicated his life will
continue and that is our consolation,'' -- British Chief Rabbi Dr
Jonathan Sacks.
''RABIN was an essential actor in the peace process in the Middle
East,'' -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
''I KNEW Yitzhak Rabin well. I knew the man of combat who contributed
so much to give Israel its security. I knew the man of peace, the
visionary statesman who, with courage and lucidity, chose dialogue and
reconciliation between the peoples of the region.
''And then I knew the man himself, a man of conviction but also a man
of passion, a man of the heart. This cowardly attack shows the will of
extremists to interrupt a peace process which he led, with vision, with
courage and single-mindedness for more than four years,'' -- French
President Jacques Chirac.
''HE was a martyr who planted the seed of the tree of peace. No
fanaticism will prevent it from growing. The day will come when it will
shelter a peaceful region under its branches. That will be the most
beautiful day of Yitzhak Rabin's life,'' -- former French president
Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
0''IT is a great loss for Israel and the world at large. Prime
Minister Rabin was a dedicated leader of his people and a courageous
campaigner for peace throughout the region,''-- UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali
''I HOPE that all the citizens of Israel and all those who, like Prime
Minister Rabin, have sought peace, maintain their courage and continue
on the path they have begun,'' -- the Pope.
PUBLIC reaction in Israel was deeply shocked. Frightened
schoolchildren drew coffins, crying clouds, and broken hearts in class
workshops and discussions which teachers hoped would soften the blow of
Mr Rabin's death.
''THEY feel terribly afraid. They don't know what will happen or why
the leader of Israel was killed. They were angry at the man who murdered
him,'' -- Hani Hyperman, a teacher at Maoz Hammacabim school near
Jerusalem.
''WE do not have a commander for the country. Who will protect us
now?'' Maoz Hyperman, aged six.
''I never in a million years could have imagined that something like
this could have happened in Israel,'' Sam Aloni, a recent immigrant from
the US.
''WE feel that even though we might not have been 100 per cent for
what he stood for, what happened was a catastrophe and nothing good is
going to come of it.'' Alon Cohen, a student opposed to Mr Rabin's
policies.
However, some groups were not saddened by the assassination.
Islamic Jihad leader Ramadan Abdallah Shallah, successor to Fathi
Shqaqi who was assassinated in Malta last week: ''I am not sorry for the
killing of Rabin who is the world's number one terrorist. It is the
blessing of the martyr leader Fathi Shqaqi's blood.''
''RABIN was an ardent advocate of state terrorism and believed that
the Zionist entity should break every international norm in the pursuit
of its sinister goals,''-- Iranian state news agency IRNA.
''WE regret that Rabin was killed by a Jew because he should have been
killed by a Palestinian. If the whole world describes Rabin as a man of
peace, we as Palestinians could only describe him as a terrorist who
killed Palestinians.
''We could only remember Rabin as the man who ordered his troops to
break the bones and even shoot Palestinian children taking part in the
(intifada) uprising. We remember him as the man who cancelled the right
of five million Palestinians to return to their homes, -- Ahmed Jibril,
leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command.
''THE Arab and Palestinian peoples have got rid of one of the killers
whose hands were stained with the blood of women and children.
''We do not regret the killing of one of the symbols of terrorism . .
. the man who issued orders only a few days ago for the assassination of
Palestinian struggler Fathi Shqaqi,'' -- the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, led by George Habash.
''THE bullets which were shot at Rabin show that the Israelis did not
even accept little concessions for the sake of peace . . . they show
that Israeli hardliners want to keep all the occupied Arab lands and
deny all rights of Arabs.
''A real peace could only be achieved through a just settlement which
is based on UN resolutions recognising the Palestinian people's rights
for self-determination and the establishment of their own state on
Palestinian soil,'' -- the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, led by Nayef Hawatmeh.

ALLOA manager Pat McAulay was distinctly unhappy yesterday. The
Recreation Park club paid out #20,000 a few weeks ago for striker Willie
Watters from Stirling Albion. But after just one full game and one as a
substitute, Watters has rocked the club by asking for a transfer.
McAulay confirmed: ''The directors are shocked at the request but have
decided to listen to offers for him. We gave him more than anyone has
got from this club before.''
To complete an unhappy day for Alloa, two goals from Mark Duthie
earned the points for division leaders Livingston.
Caledonian Thistle continue to show their scoring abilities with
another five against Arbroath. Ian Stewart and Charlie Christie both got
two.
A Keith Ferris strike three minutes from time helped Ross County to
see off a fighting Albion Rovers 4-3.
Queen's Park are off the bottom, as goals from Scott Edgar and Ross
Caven beat East Stirling 2-1 and Brechin defeated Cowdenbeath 2-0.

AIRDRIE are set to sign Maltese international keeper David Cluett in a
#100,000 swoop a week today.
He will jet into Scotland for talks after playing in Malta's final
European Championship qualifier against Belarus on Sunday.
Cluett, 30, spent a month on trial with Rangers last season, but the
Ibrox club decided not to offer him a contract.
The 6ft 4ins player has won 65 caps for his country and the Diamonds
are keen to add him to their struggling side.
Their promotion challenge has flopped this term and they lie 10 points
behind first division leaders Dunfermline and Dundee United.
Current keeper John Martin is the club's longest-serving player having
joined in 1980.
But Airdrie manager Alex MacDonald may now feel it is time for a
change as they try to salvage their season.

IT is a rare occasion indeed when a fixture between Arsenal and
Manchester United takes only third billing on a Premiership Saturday.
0 However, vying for top spot were two huge attractions in the
north-east, an area once more qualifying for that old cliche as a
''hot-bed of soccer''. At St James' Park, Newcastle defeated Liverpool
2-1 in a game where the allocation of points had every chance of being
critical in the eventual championship outcome.
Meanwhile, a little way south at the equally resplendent new Riverside
Stadium, a little waif of a man had attracted the greatest interest
generated by any foreign import since a curious public flocked to see
two other World Cup winners, Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, at Tottenham
back in 1978.
In Middlesbrough, where the last authentic hero was probably Brian
Clough 35 years ago, Juninho's new fans painted their faces in yellow
and green, found sombreros from somewhere and Brazilian colours from
anywhere.
It was a lot of hype to live up to, but the consensus was that
Brazil's Footballer of the Year came out of it pretty well. The darting
run past Gary McAllister to set up Jan-Aage Fjortoft's goal within 10
minutes was a good start and Juninho could hardly be faulted for Leeds
United's determined rally that earned an equaliser by half-time and a
point at the end.
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson said: ''Juninho showed some lovely
touches and good vision. He's had a lot to cope with, but he showed me
enough to know that he'll excite us.''
At St James', meanwhile, Newcastle and Liverpool showed enough to
suggest they will excite us for the rest of the season too. Les
Ferdinand's opening goal (he has scored in every home game this season)
had the touch of a man in form and in luck, the ball striking his left
leg after bouncing off his right, and Newcastle's luck held for an
undeserved victory.
They took a battering in the second half. ''At times we were
mesmerised by Liverpool's passing,''said Newcastle manager Kevin
Keegain. The upshot is, nevertheless, that his former club have been
left eight points in arrears of his present one, which is a lot of
ground to make up on a team that shows little sign of falling away like
last season.
Newcastle's lead at the top is five points following Manchester
United's defeat at Highbury. Dennis Bergkamp's goal after a Dennis Irwin
slip settled another game that could have gone either way.
At the other end of the table, Manchester City gave their loyal fans
some hope with their first league win, beating Bolton thanks to a Nicky
Summerbee goal.

Rangers 2, Falkirk 0
RANGERS fans must have lost count of the number of times Ally McCoist
has bailed them out of difficult situations. Without the presence of Mr
Goals, Saturday's premier division match at Ibrox would have been
something of a non event. Seldom can 42,000 fans, packed into a stadium
built for atmosphere, have been so subdued.
Rangers, crippled by injury and suffering an almighty hangover
following the Champions' League mauling by Juventus, played about in the
middle of the field, probing and searching -- most of the time without
success -- to find a hole in the Falkirk defence. Often they had to turn
back and start from scratch and the rumbles of discontent mounted in the
stands.
Falkirk made no pretence of the fact that they had come to Ibrox
hoping to grab a point. They had nine men trying to get themselves
behind the ball, leaving twin strikers Mo Johnston and Paul McGrillen in
isolation. With Rangers being so ineffective, the tactic may have paid
off -- but McCoist proved the difference.
If there was a flaw in Falkirk's defensive set-up, it surely must have
been the decision to give Alex Cleland the freedom of the right flank.
There were times when he must have felt closer to the crowd than any
action on the field, but in 33 minutes the visitors paid a heavy penalty
for ignoring the former Dundee United man.
Ian Durrant, who was a major success on a day of mediocrity, sent
Cleland off on a run with an incisive pass, and before the Falkirk
defence could get back in numbers he delivered an inch-perfect cross
towards McCoist, who rose and powered a header past Billy Lamont.
McCoist struck again four minutes from the interval when slack marking
allowed him to take a through ball and shoot low past the keeper.
Falkirk complained bitterly to the referee, and afterwards Falkirk
manager John Lambie said they were not claiming offside. I understand
the players were furious that referee Orr had not given what they
thought was an obvious free kick in the midfield.
After McCoist's second strike, the match was effectively over and the
second half was mainly awash with boredom. But McCoist, who will play
his 500th match for Rangers against Kilmarnock on Wednesday, made a plea
to those who sat mainly in silence on Saturday. ''We need the vocal
backing of our fans,'' he said.
''To be fair to the fans, they were probably a bit shell-shocked after
the two matches against Juventus. We are all well aware that we were
outclassed by one of the best sides in Europe, but we can't afford to
dwell on it. If you do that, then you find problems that aren't really
there. We had to lift ourselves and get on with the job of keeping our
lead in the premier division.
''Too often the fans come along and sit back expecting us to score
four or five goals and when it doesn't happen they are subdued. We have
to create our own atmosphere.
''Our main objective is to win the premier division championship, and
if I could make a plea from all the players, it would be to tell our
fans we need their vocal support. I appreciate they pay their money and
they can keep quiet if they want, but it's so important for us that we
hear them.
''When there is a big challenge, the fans are noisy as any set of
supporters, but we also need them solidly behind us in games such as
these against Falkirk.''
McCoist, while admitting it gets tougher every year, is convinced that
Rangers, already four points ahead, can go on to win their eighth
consecutive title.
''The gaffer won't say it, but I'm confident that we will win the
league again,'' he said. ''Everyone outside the club and the fans want
to see us fall flat on our faces -- and that's natural -- but I don't
think that will happen.
''Mind you, it gets tougher every season and there will be a strong
challenge this time. Celtic are going well and I think they will be our
main challengers, but Hibs are also playing some good football and they
also must fancy their chances.''
Then came the mischievous McCoist grin and he added: ''Celtic and Hibs
will mount a challenge, and, no doubt, wee Joe will be looking for
Aberdeen to go on a run towards the end of the season.'' That was a
reference to Aberdeen winger Joe Miller's recent remarks that Celtic
would be the big danger to Aberdeen's title hopes this season.
Falkirk, who had won their two previous matches, now find themselves
back at the foot of the table and manager John Lambie faces a daunting
task, even this early in the season, in getting the team in shape for
what is shaping up like a dogfight in the premier division basement.
Lambie was disappointed that his side didn't stretch Rangers a bit
more on Saturday, but he points to missed chances as his major
disappointment.
''You never get many chances at Ibrox and when they do come you have
to take them,'' he said. ''We had four good chances in the second half
and missed the lot.
''I also thought our keeper should have stopped their second goal.
McCoist didn't hit it properly and it went under the keeper's body.''
Meantime, Rangers' injury situation doesn't look like easing before
they face Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Wednesday. Paul Gascoigne, who
suffered a recurrence of a thigh injury, may make it, but that is the
best manager Walter Smith can hope for.

ARTHURLIE continue to lead the Reebok Premier Division, despite losing
1-0 to Petershill on Saturday.
There were few goalmouth incidents in the first half, but at the
restart a Rocky Chrichton header hit the bar and the same player
dispossessed Petershill sweeper Smith and only a brave stop from
goalkeeper McLaughlin kept the scoresheet blank.
Those were to be Arthurie's best chances. Petershill's winner in 53
minutes came from a defensive error, Stuart MacDonald capitalising to
score.
With 10 minutes to go they should have made it two when substitute
Scott Gilbertson broke through, and passed to McClafferty, who mis-hit
his shot past a post.
Arthurlie's current form continues to disappoint, more especially with
the OVD Cup tie against Linlithgow Rose their next game.
Pollok and Shettleston shared the points in their 1-1 draw which
allowed both to close the gap on Arthurlie.
Yoker stretched their lead at the top of the Reebok First Division
with a 2-1 win over Glencairn. Lanark United lost their first league
game of the season and their opportunity to go top of the second
division with their 1-0 defeat by Bellshills. A thirtieth minute goal by
James Greene gave Bellshill the points.
Glenafton moved to the top of the Western Stagecoach League with a 4-3
win over Irvine Meadow.
A Norman Montgomery 25-yarder gave Cumnock a 1-0 half-time lead at
Beith. With five minutes to go Duncan Sinclair scored a second. Sixty
seconds later substitute Paul Greene put Beith back in the game but
'Nock substitute Laurie Lamont scored to restore their two-goal lead.
Kilwinning will meet Cumnock in the semi-final of the Irvine Times Cup
following their 4-0 defeat of Lugar on Saturday. Ardeer Thistle will
play Glenafton in the other semi.
An eighty-eighth minute strike by Martin Walsh gave Kilbirnie the
points in their derby game against Dalry Thistle.
Linlithgow Rose, unbeaten after 16 matches, looked well on their way
to a convincing win against John Walker League leaders Arniston Rangers
when they raced to a 3-0 first-half lead. However, Arniston staged a
remarkable comeback and Myles, Stout, and a Tait header five minutes
from time gave them a share of the points.
Whitburn's 2-1 victory over Camelon gave them their first league win
of the season and took them off bottom place in the John Walker League.

STUDENT Marc Falconer should have been playing on Saturday in Ireland,
but he celebrated his twenty-third birthday by coming on as a substitute
and lifting the gloom from Clyde.
Falconer did not make his appearance until the seventieth minute of
an, until then, scoreless game against the bottom club, Montrose.
But 11 minutes later he strolled through to open the scoring, and in a
late Clyde surge Eddie Annand added a second, before Falconer provided
the cross for Annand to complete the scoring in the final minute for a
three-goal win.
That brought smiles to the faces of the Clyde support and manager Alex
Smith revealed: ''Bangor asked for Marc on loan and he went over and
played for them last week.
''But they took him off after 50 minutes and I was not pleased at
that. I recalled him, he scored a hat trick in a midweek reserve game,
and that earned him his place on the bench.''
Another manager happy with midweek work was Stranraer's Alex
McAnespie, who paid out #15,000 for striker Steve Kerrigan from
Clydebank.
Kerrigan, on his debut, scored one and provided another as Stranraer
earned a point in a 3-3 draw with second divsion leaders East fife.
The Fifers' player-manager Steve Archibald was also in the thick of
the action, being fouled for the penalty which allowed David Beaton to
open the scoring and also getting one himself.
But the decision by the newly-appointed Ayr United manager Gordon
Dalziel to come on late as a substitute in the hope of saving a point
did not pay off as his side went down again at home, 2-1 against
Stirling Albion.
The Stirling manager, Kevin Drinkell, was particularly pleased at the
build-up and execution of the winner from John Gibson and remarked: ''We
are now joint third and our target must be to turn the pressure on those
above us.''
David Wood had given Albion a second-minute lead, but Brian Bilsland
had equalised just before half-time.
Queen Of The South and Forfar had to be satisfied with a point each in
a 1-1 draw.

PALESTINIANS and Israel's Arab neighbours tried to read the runes of
Israeli domestic politics yesterday for any signs the assassination of
Yitzhak Rabin would set back, disrupt or even accelerate the Middle East
peace process.
The appointment of Mr Shimon Peres as acting Prime Minister reassured
Arab states committed to peace agreements but diplomats said some will
doubt Mr Peres's ability to fill Mr Rabin's shoes as a leader able to
inspire confidence among Israelis.
There was less at stake for Arab states further afield and those
opposed to the latest agreements gloated over the novelty of a Jewish
extremist killing a Jewish leader.
Among Arabs who have dealt with Israeli leaders, Mr Peres was much
better liked than Mr Rabin, a man widely seen as cold, abrasive and
arrogantly insensitive to Arab public opinion.
Mr Peres met more frequently than Mr Rabin with Arab leaders such as
Mr Yasser Arafat of the PLO and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and he
was more comfortable in their company.
''We have full confidence in Peres's commitment to the peace process .
. . He will find we give him every help towards the aim we are all
working for,'' said Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt, the first Arab
state to make peace with Israel.
King Hussein of Jordan said he believed Peres would follow in Mr
Rabin's footsteps. ''I wish him all the very best, he will have all my
support as he pursues the goal of peace,'' he added.
One senior Egyptian official, who asked not to be named, said he did
not foresee any sudden change in Israeli policy or even any delay in
redeploying Israeli troops in the West Bank -- the current phase of the
Palestinian self-rule plan.
''I don't see an immediate negative reaction. I think the Israeli
people will come together and it could even reinforce the peace
faction,'' he said.
''But I'm really concerned about three or four months down the line.
Then we'll see if Peres has enough authority with the military to take
the hard decisions,'' he added.
A trickle of Jordanians supporting the nation's 1994 peace treaty with
Israel gathered at the Israeli embassy in Amman to express their
condolences.
But many ordinary Jordanians remain hostile to Israel and the
assassination appeared to deal a blow to King Hussein, whose rapport
with the Israeli leader was a key ingredient in developing closer ties
between the two nations.
Palestinians said they feared the assassination could delay the the
widening of self-rule to the West Bank and Israeli troop redeployment.
Reaction in the streets of PLO-ruled Gaza and the occupied West Bank
to the killing was mixed, in contrast to the outright condemnation by
PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
''I am very sad and very shocked for this awful and terrible crime
against one of the brave leaders of Israel and the peacemakers,'' Mr
Arafat said.
Many ordinary Palestinians also condemned the shooting but few
sympathised with an Israeli leader they remembered as a warrior against
Arab armies and occupier who ordered soldiers to break the bones of Arab
protesters during the Palestinian uprising.
Some opponents of the Israeli-PLO peace deal referred to media reports
that Mr Rabin ordered the assassination in Malta last month of Islamic
Jihad leader Fathi Shqaqi. They said Mr Rabin deserved to die.
''To hell with him and to the worst fate. He deserves this punishment.
In Islam, a killer must be killed and Rabin has killed many of our
people,'' said Mr Jamal Ahmed, a 32-year-old grocer in Gaza city.
A Muslim militant rally in Beirut to mourn the death of Fathi Shqaqi
turned yesterday into a celebration of the assassination of Rabin.
Some 5000 Lebanese and Palestinian militants, chanting ''death to
Israel'', joined a rally called by Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hizbollah group
to mourn the killing of the chief of the Islamic Jihad Movement in
Palestine.
''It was God's will that this meeting be held for two events, a
painful one that hurt us and made our eyes cry: Shqaqi's martrydom, and
another cheerful event that made hearts happy and filled the streets
until the morning: the death of the biggest of the terrorists of our
time . . . Yitzhak Rabin,'' Hizbollah chief Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah told
the rally at a mosque.
Shqaqi's successor, Mr Ramadan Shallah, vowed that his militants will
continue suicide bombings against Israeli targets.
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani called the assassination
''divine revenge'' for the killing of Shqaqi.
Mr Rafsanjani was quoted by Tehran radio as saying in parliament:
''Rabin, who had expressed happiness about the assassination of Shqaqi,
was assassinated himself. And that by a Jew and in the centre of Zionist
power.
''That is nothing but a clear example of divine revenge for oppressors
and is a manifestation of God's show of force.''
Radical Palestinian guerrilla leader Ahmed Jibril lamented that
Rabin's assassin was not a Palestinian.
''We regret that Rabin was killed by a Jew because he should have been
killed by a Palestinian,'' Mr Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command (PFLP-GC) said in
Damascus.

THE world's leaders are gathering today in Israel, a country in
mourning, but with the grief clouded by a fear of civil strife after the
killing of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a fellow Jew.
Caretaker Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who took over after the
73-year-old leader was shot dead on Saturday night at a Tel Aviv peace
rally, acted quickly to try to calm the country, vowing to push ahead
with the peace process.
''He didn't make a final testament but the last song he sang (at the
rally) was the 'Song of Peace','' Mr Peres said. ''He put this song in
his pocket and the bullet went through this song. The song of peace
ringing in our ears will not end.''
However, there were warning words from the occupied West Bank. At
Kiryat Arba, Rabbi Shimon Ben-Zion, a teacher in the settlement's Nir
Jewish seminary, said: ''What happened last night, God forbid, could
cause war between us, between Jews.''
Kiryat Arba was the home of US-born settler Baruch Goldstein, who
massacred 29 Arab worshippers in a mosque in Hebron in February 1994
before survivors killed him.
Hebrew University Professor Ehud Sprinzak, an expert on Jewish
militant groups, said it was the ideology of many of its residents that
had spawned the first assassination of an Israeli Prime Minister.
For the moment at least, the tension is internal. If Mr Rabin had been
killed by a Muslim, the impact would have been very different. Now Arab
leaders can no longer argue that Mr Rabin had not pushed the concessions
he was making to the Palestinians to the limits of his own constituency.
The world at large has paid tribute to Mr Rabin, and its leaders, led
by US President Bill Clinton are to attend the funeral today, anxious
that the peace process in which the Israeli war hero was a crucial
player does not come adrift. Mr Clinton's delegation to the funeral will
include former presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter.
Police commissioner Assaf Hefetz said 10,000 police and soldiers would
guard mourners at today's funeral at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl military
cemetery.
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, Mr Rabin's former foe who became a partner
in peace, decided to stay away for fear of provoking hardline factions.
He hailed Mr Rabin as a brave leader and said he was sad and shocked.
However, hardliners in Iran and militant Lebanese and Palestinians
celebrated, saying Mr Rabin had reaped what he had sown.
''We regret that Rabin was killed by a Jew because he should have been
killed by a Palestinian,'' Ahmed Jibril said in Damascus. He heads the
general command of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
Mr Rabin was shot twice at point blank range by 25-year-old law
student Yigal Amir, who supported Jewish settlement on Palestinian land.
Mr Rabin's coffin, draped in Israel's Star of David flag, was brought
by generals in a command car from Tel Aviv to lie in state before the
Knesset in Jerusalem. Thousands of mourners, led by his widow Leah,
filed past the casket.
They were stunned that a Jew had gunned down the leader upon whom they
had pinned their hopes of ending half-a-century of Arab-Israeli wars.
It appeared that the ideology which fostered hatred of Arabs and had
its centre in Kiryat Arba had finally overflowed in Saturday night's
killing. It had become what Israelis fear most: violence of Jew against
Jew.
''He (Rabin's assassin) murdered another Jew and we can't understand
it. We can't justify it at all,'' said Rabbi Shimon Ben-Zion. ''That is
what we told our students . . . although everyone had a lot against the
prime minister and felt he endangered us, endangered the nation and the
Land of Israel.''
Professor Sprinzak said that although the assassin is from near Tel
Aviv, the atmosphere in which he acted came from the West Bank. ''There
was a very clear process . . . Rabin became almost fair game and it took
place exactly where you are today (Kiryat Arba).''
Kiryat Arba is a main centre of Kach, a Jewish supremacy group,
founded by American-Israeli rabbi Meir Kahane, who was shot dead by an
Arab in New York in 1990.
In Tel Aviv, meanwhile, Mrs Leah Rabin thanked hundreds of Israelis
who held a candlelight vigil outside her apartment. However, she asked
the crowd where they had been when anti-government protesters had staged
demonstrations against her husband's peace policies there.
''Too bad you didn't come then,'' she said. ''But you came now and it
makes me happy and encourages me and my children and grandchildren that
you respect his memory in this wonderful and respectful and beautiful
way. Thank you very much for being here. I appreciate it and I love you
on his behalf.''
Recalling the assassination at the end of the peace rally attended by
more than 100,000 Rabin supporters under the slogan ''Peace yes,
violence no,'' Mrs Rabin said: ''In his last moments he heard the loud
applause and cheers . . . and those were his last moments.''
Mr Clinton said: ''The world has lost one of its greatest men, a
warrior for his nation's freedom and now a martyr for his nation's
peace.''
Mr Major said: ''I found him a man utterly determined to proceed down
the path of the peace process . . . No one has done as much towards
seeking peace as he has.''
Labour leader Tony Blair: ''It's a horrific tragedy. Israel has lost a
distinguished prime minister and the world has lost a great worker for
peace.''
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown: ''He was one of the exceptional
leaders of the century. He has done as much as anyone to deliver the
prospect of peace in the Middle East.''
The Pope said: ''I hope that all the citizens of Israel and all those
who, like prime minister Rabin, have sought peace, maintain their
courage and continue on the path they have begun.''

<HEADLINE>EXCLUSIVE: Scotland will have no hope in New Zealand. Hastings hits out at SRU's bid to get players 'on the cheap'</HEADLINE>

GAVIN HASTINGS, as captain of Scotland and the British Lions, was
probably the best-known rugby player in the world. Today, in an
exclusive interview with chief rugby writer DEREK DOUGLAS, the most
capped player and leading points scorer in the history of the Scottish
game gives a provocative and candid insider's account of the changes
which have rocked the game.
THE man who led Scotland to a World Cup quarter-final this summer
before retiring with a Scottish record of 61 appearances for his
country, has warned the Scottish Rugby Union that they will send the
international side to New Zealand next summer with no chance of
competing on a level playing field unless they make more serious
attempts to address the issue of professionalism.
As the Union and the international squad are on the brink of signing a
deal worth a maximum of #22,500 a man, Gavin Hastings accuses the SRU of
''talking down'' the players in order to get them on the cheap, and
advises them to ''get real'' and ''get their heads out of the sand.''
Hastings fears that when the Scots tour New Zealand next summer, then
Scotland's semi-professionals will be placed at a severe disadvantage
when confronted by the full-time pros in New Zealand rugby.
In a wide-ranging interview, Hastings is also scathing about the SRU
proposal that district sides and not clubs should represent Scotland in
the European Cup tournament next season and calls for the Murrayfield
committee structure to be scapped.
On the issue of professionalism in Scotland, Hastings declares: ''The
SRU have talked down the players so that they can get them on the cheap.
Why do we always play down the achievements of the players?
''There was comment from Murrayfield about not wanting heroes in the
game because these guys are not as big as they think they are. If we
play down the merits of the top players then, to me, we are not selling
the sport.
''We're in a professional game here, and for anybody to talk down the
merits of the players is just nonsense. If people deserve the accolades
then play them up. Don't talk them down to save a few bob. We can do
with all the heroes we can get in this country of ours and there ain't
too many of them around.''
He adds: ''There's been so much talk about professionalism leading to
a level playing field. When Scotland go down to New Zealand next summer
then they'll be on about #20,000, which at this moment in time is what
the SRU consider to be a realistic sum.
''Our boys will be playing against the New Zealand All Blacks who will
be averaging #100,000-a-man. How can you argue that is fair and
reasonable?
''Then the Union are saying that they don't want our players to give
up their jobs. Well, quite clearly, there are very few of our players
who would give up their jobs for #20,000. On the other hand, if the New
Zealanders are going to be paid #100,000, then they are going to do
nothing else but play rugby.
''If the administrators think that this is going to give the Scottish
rugby team a good chance of winning down there then I'm sorry, but
they've got their heads in the sand. Let's get real and let's start
talking about realistic money. Do we actually want our guys to be
professionals or not?
''With the attitude of the likes of the SRU then quite obviously that
'level playing field' that everybody was seeking is a long way off.
''Probably we can't afford to pay #100,000 at this stage but it
strikes me that the SRU have just dismissed that scenario without really
examining it. There are a lot of soccer players in Scotland who are
being paid those sums of money and they're not even playing for the
national side.''
Hastings says that it was the administrators and not the players who
decreed that the game was to be professional but in the Northern
Hemisphere, no structure was set in place to accommodate a professional
game.
That was why, he says, he backed Kerry Packer in his attempts to set
up a global professional game in opposition to the Rupert Murdoch
bankrolled game in the Southern Hemisphere.
Players in New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa have benefited
while their Northern Hemisphere counterparts remain the poor, country
cousins.
The former Scotland captain, who has now set up his own sports
marketing business, Hastings International, is also calling for a
compete overhaul of the Murrayfield committee structure.
''If the game has become professional then you have to run the game in
a professional manner and the days of having committees who do it on an
amateur basis are over. You need an executive to run the game on a
professional basis. Let's get real. Let's start talking about this whole
thing in real terms. The committee structure at Murrayfield has to go.
''We are now in a professional game and if the people who run it now
are not professional enough to do it then they have to go. It's as
simple as that.
''I don't want to slag off the SRU, and I hope I'm not doing that, but
we have to be realistic. The game is now professional. Let's get the
game run from Murrayfield on a professional basis. The game hasn't been
run on a professional basis before but the time has now come for change.
Let's do it now. Let's forget about what's happened in the past. The
game has changed forever,'' he declares.
Hastings says that his next challenge is to get his company up and
running. ''I've said that it will be called Hastings International Ltd,
not Hastings Parochial Scotland Ltd, because I'm setting my sights on a
worldwide basis, just as I did with my rugby.
''I'm ambitious but I have to start somehere. I've started from a
small office round in Edinburgh but you have to start somewhere.
''David Murray started off in a small way 25 years ago and look at him
now.
''Jackie Stewart is a great inspiration for me. I admire what he has
achieved in the business world after a susccessful sporting career and
those are the people that I admire. I have given myself this challenge
which is totally different to the challenges that I set myself in rugby
but that's good because I can get my teeth into it and really go for it.
That's the next part of my life.
''So far as representing the international players is concerned, and a
lot has been written about that, it is really up to them. I've said that
I'm available. There is no reason why in the future the players all need
to be managed or represented by the same individual.
''On the wider front, I think it is strange that you have all this
experience and you are not called upon in some capacity for use to be
made of it.
''I sat down with the SRU senior vice president Freddie McLeod some
months ago and he has not spoken to me since. I find that very strange.
He asked me for my views on where the game was going but he has never
got back to me. I find that odd.
''Until such time as the players have signed a participation agreement
binding them to the International Players Trust fund then they are free
agents, and to my knowledge they have not signed anything yet. That's
the scenario. There's no problem but as things stand the players can do
whatever they want.
''Why, for instance, do they need to sign anything before the game
against Western Samoa? There's no need for them to do that. Surely they
would be better taking their time if they are not getting what they
want. Just take your time. There's no need to rush into anything,'' he
declares.

Jerusalem
SOME events change the course of history.
The assassination of US President John F Kennedy in 1963 was one such
event. So was the assassination of Egypt's President Anwar Sadat in
1981.
The assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a
right-wing Jew at the weekend is another.
Not just Israel or the emerging Palestinian state -- but the whole of
the Middle East will never be the same again.
President Sadat's assassination set back the prospect of Middle East
peace because it was in its infancy and there were no other Arab leaders
brave enough to take up the baton.
Mr Rabin's assassination is a regional earthquake which could break
the Middle Eastern log-jam and accelerate events which might have taken
years or even decades to crystalise.
The likely confirmation of Shimon Peres as the country's next Prime
Minister will come as a relief, too, to an Arab world which has
developed a vested economic interest in Middle East peace.
If the Israeli Prime Minister had been assassinated by a Muslim
fundamentalist, the impact could have been very different.
Now Arab leaders can no longer argue that Mr Rabin had not pushed the
concessions he was making to the Palestinians to the limits of his own
constituency and that his desire for peace was not sincere.
The fact that PLO leader Yasser Arafat, Jordan's King Hussein and
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak have reacted as though Mr Rabin was part
of the same club of peacemakers is a sign that, once the shock and
trauma of Mr Rabin's death have passed, Middle East peace could leap
forward in a way unimaginable even a few days ago.
Political constraints over the highly sensitive issue of the future of
Jerusalem had kept both King Hussein and President Mubarak away from the
contested Israeli capital.
Today they will join hands with acting Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, US President Bill Clinton and other world leaders at the grave of
a fallen warrior-turned-peacemaker to console a stunned nation by
endorsing Yitzhak Rabin's legacy of peace.
The mourning nation has been deeply traumatised by Mr Rabin's
assassination and Mr Peres's transition government could be hard-pressed
to assert his leadership and preserve a Government which holds a
one-vote majority in the Knesset.
The impact of the assassination on the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process will largely depend on whether Mr Peres decides to call an early
election ahead of the scheduled date in November next year.
This could mean temporary delays in implementing the next phase of the
Israel-PLO peace accord and the extension of autonomy to the
Palestinians.
But Mr Peres's tough task in guiding Israel through its darkest moment
will be eased by the gesture of Binyamin Netanyahu, leader of the
right-wing Likud opposition party, who said yesterday that the Likud
would not seek to prevent Mr Peres from forming a new government.
In a democracy a government is changed by elections and not by murder,
said Mr Netanyahu, who had earlier described the Rabin assassination as
one of the worst tragedies in the history of the state.
As one of Mr Rabin's toughest critics, Netanyahu's swift and
conciliatory reaction is a clrar indicator of how right-wing sentiment
is likely to be marginalised in the months ahead.
President Ezer Weizman is expected to wait until after the funeral
today before holding negotiations on the setting up of a new government
and naming a new Defence Minister, the key portfolio which Mr Rabin had
held since his election for his second term as Prime Minister in 1992.
The most likely candidate is Interior Minister and former Israeli
Defence Force (IDF) Chief-of-Staff Ehud Barak.
''This is a move which could help bolster Peres's credibility with
Israel's parliamentary right,'' said one Western diplomat.
Public sentiment has already swung dramamtically against the
right-wing which is likely to tone down both its rhetoric and actions in
the months ahead.
Mr Peres, while holding impeccable credentials as a life-long Zionist,
accomplished diplomat and architect of Israel's arms and nuclear
industries, has always lacked the credibility that Mr Rabin enjoyed as a
successful general.
But he has won wide respect as a visionary and skilful negotiator who
has built up a formidable relationship of trust with Arafat, King
Hussein, Mr Mubarak and other Arab leaders during the PLO-Israel
negotiations.
The assassination has shattered the myth of Jewish unity and
crystallised changes taking place within Israel which will also speed up
the pace of Middle East peace.
These include the collapse of old-style Zionism, the globalisation of
Israel and the emergence of a dynamic first world economy which puts the
country on an equal footing to western democracies and less dependent on
its Jewish exclusivity.
The new momentum towards rapprochement between Arab and Jew could also
help turn back the tide of Islamic fundamentalism which has been
threatening the implementation of the PLO-Israel accord and the broader
quest for a comprehensive Middle East peace.

THREE old stalwarts, Graeme Armstrong, Eamonn Bannon, and George
McGeachie, and a man in a duffel coat, Terry Christie, provided
Stenhousemuir with the biggest win in their 111-year history yesterday
when Dundee United were defeated in the final of the Challenge Cup at
McDiarmid Park.
Stenhousemuir had never been to a cup final before yesterday, but
after the regulation 90 minutes and half an hour of overtime had ended
goalless, they won a penalty shoot-out 5-4.
The Ochilview club played with more belief than their more illustrious
opponents who, alarmingly for them, looked like a first division team
rather than an outfit intent on regaining their premier division status.
As Christie's Warriors celebrated with their fans after having
collected the cup, which from a distance looked like a sweetie jar,
United's manager Billy Kirkwood said: ''I have no complaints about the
result. We didn't play at all.
''Terry Christie did his homework, and killed any threat we might have
had in the wide areas. In fact, I thought it was a crap game and
Stenhousemuir thoroughly deserved to win.''
Kirkwood said he was upset at a Sunday newspaper report that one of
his players, Andy McLaren, was wanted by Celtic -- ''we have not had an
offer, it was no more than a chat on the phone,'' he said -- but added
it was not being offered as an excuse either. ''No-one will be leaving
Tannadice. I am building a team,'' he said.
On yesterday's evidence, he has his work cut out.
