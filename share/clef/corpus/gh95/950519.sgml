With the opening of a new fireside design showroom in Glasgow, Lucy
Lockhart looks at the latest range of styles available.
SATURDAY sees the official opening of Hestia Fireside Design at 96
Great Western Road, Glasgow. Customers visiting the superb display of 27
custom-made mantelpieces will be offered -- on Saturday and Sunday -- a
celebratory glass of wine to sip as they browse among the broad range of
inspirational ideas on view, which will disappoint no-one.
From the era of the sixties and seventies when ''domestic vandalism''
was rife and period features were systematically ripped out of so many
houses, things have turned full circle, with people now anxious to
reinstate fine craftsmanship back into their homes.
While the upsurge in the installation of central heating encouraged
the removal or closing up of fireplaces at this time, happily, it was a
trend which didn't last. Over the past decade or so, more people in
Britain have decided that a fire and surrounding mantelpiece makes an
unsurpassable focal point in a room. Advancing technology has played an
important part, with gas coal effect fires now highly efficient in many
cases, as well as looking convincingly like the real thing.
Eight years ago, Colin Greig opened his first branch of Hestia
Fireside Design at 4 South Trinity Road, Edinburgh, followed two years
on by a second branch at 90 Comiston Road in the capital. Now, a third
showroom has seen him expand into Glasgow, traditionally a city which
appreciates style, good design and quality.
''All our mantelpieces are custom-made,'' explained Mr Greig. ''We
have our own craftsmen in Edinburgh. If someone wants a mantel two
inches smaller, it takes us exactly the same amount of time to make as a
larger one, it costs no extra. In many places, they either can't do it
because everything is mass produced, or customers pay an extra 15%-20%
just to change it by a couple of inches. To us it makes no difference,
we offer a flexible, custom-made service.''
Similar flexibility is available in many different ways. If you see a
mantel in limed oak, for example, and would prefer it in mahogany,
perhaps without one or two of the design features, it can be done. The
woods used by Hestia are pine, mahogany and oak, and apparently the
last, which is also the most expensive, is tops in popularity.
''We have copied designs from photographs people have brought to us,''
explains Colin Greig, pointing to a superb example in carved wood, ''and
we can make sure that details like the top of the mantelpiece being
broad enough to take a lamp, are looked after. We use real wood,'' he
adds, ''many people use MDF and so on, but you can see the difference in
our models, in the graining of the wood and how it feels to the touch.
They do look beautiful when they're installed, they really enhance a
room.''
Hestia also imports its marble direct from Portugal, and holds large
stocks for its own use, often in unusual colours rarely seen elsewhere.
''We have marble masons working for us, and again we can make it to just
the dimensions required,'' says Mr Greig, ''there's no limit to what we
can offer. We do try hard to be completely different.''
He points to a marble fireplace with beautifully sculpted angles,
explaining: ''Most people can't do that. Quality is what we are about,
that is our sector of the market; with our quality of materials and
workmanship we can't compete at the bottom end of the market, but in
comparison with the top end we are competitive with others in the field,
but we do think our quality is exceptional.''
Certainly the range of styles and designs on display is excellent, it
would be unusual for almost anyone not to find their dream come true
here: ''There must be about 1500 to 2000 combinations feasible from what
we have on show,'' comments Colin Greig. ''Verine are our main gas fire
suppliers, and we use Stovax for the tiles, but everything else, all the
mantels, we make ourselves.''
In terms of design and period, the company finds its customers' tastes
are broad, with both mature and younger buyers united in their desire to
restore properties to their original glory.
''We've found over the years that customers come in with their own
ideas of what they want, but once they've had a look around, they
frequently end up changing their minds and buying something that they
see,'' smiles Mr Greig.
Convector boxes are very efficient fires. ''Most people have central
heating now and don't want a fire as a complete central heater point,''
says Colin Greig. ''Usually people want a fire as a focal point with
some heat, but we always ask customers what it is they want the fire to
do, then advise them accordingly.''
Easy to install
ONCE upon a time, a house without a chimney meant that installing a
coal-effect gas fire was impossible unless there was an outside wall to
take a balanced flue.
Now, however, Colin Greig explains: ''We can put a fireplace into any
house, using a Power Flue -- all our working fireplaces in the Glasgow
showroom use this method -- fumes are ducted through the back of the
fire, and drawn out by fan to the outdoors.''
Another innovative idea is Switch Craft, a system which allows a gas
fire to be lit electronically, by a remote switch.
From start to finish, ordering to fitting takes between one and three
weeks, according to Mr Greig, and six months' interest-free credit is
available, with a 20% deposit. The new showroom is open Monday to Friday
between 9am and 5.30pm; Saturday 9am to 5pm and Sunday 12 noon to 5pm.

Pretoria
SCOTLAND'S rugby management face a strategic decision in the next few
days as the clock ticks down to their Rugby World Cup opener against
Ivory Coast next Friday.
Should they pick the best side for all of the pool games -- against
Ivory Coast, Tonga, and France -- or should they rest as many of the
front-line players as they think circumstances allow.
In all likelihood, the management have already made up their minds,
but yesterday, team manager Duncan Paterson was still weighing up the
situation.
''There are arguments both ways, especially when one takes into
account the possibility of injuries.''
The easiest game in Scotland's section will be against the Ivory
Coast, who recently lost 97-7 to Northern Transvaal and who,
incidentally, staged a reception for the Scots on Wednesday night.
It will be of the utmost importance that the Scots get their campaign
underway with a convincing display against the Ivorians. The top players
therefore will be on parade at the Rustenburg opener. Within the space
of nine days, Scotland must play Tonga and France.
Ideally, Scotland would wish to field the first-choice XV on each
occasion, but three international matches within the space of just more
than a week is a tough schedule for any side, let alone one like
Scotland where player resources do not run that deep.
At the inaugural World Cup in 1987, the Scottish strategy was to go
with the first-choice players. The result then was a quarter-final exit
at the hands of the All Blacks.
In 1991, the Scots mixed and matched, choosing a blend of first and
second string players where appropriate. The outcome then was a
semi-final defeat by England and a third/fourth place play-off, again
against New Zealand.
One player who has a particular interest in the strategy which the
management adopt out here in Pretoria is the Edinburgh Academical lock,
Jeremy Richardson. Now 32, he was a member of the 1987 World Cup squad
but returned from New Zealand without having played a game.
Richardson, who had to wait until November last year for his first
full cap, against South Africa, said yesterday: ''The thing about 1987
was that there were five individuals in the party who did not play. One
of those included Roger Baird. The last time he had been out in New
Zealand was with the British Lions. I was one of the youngest in the
group, and although I was disappointed it was much worse for the likes
of Roger.
''It was the late Bob Munro, the team manager, who said that, with
hindsight, it had been a mistake not to give all the players a game.
''From my perspective, I am hoping that this time they will give
everybody a run.''
Richardson adds that, having been involved in 1987 and not making the
1991 squad, the odds must have been stacked against him re-appearing for
this World Cup.
''But what it comes down to is the old David Sole adage about miles on
the clock and not age that truly matters. I have not been involved in
international rugby and so I have not been taking the physical
hammerings like a lot of the guys who have been involved all the time.''
* THE World Cup referees are ready to revolt if the organisers don't
change their minds on a new lineout ruling. As the 26 officials left
yesterday to fly to the Republic, they were ready for a showdown with
the law makers tomorrow.
The referees have been instructed to ban the step out of the lineout,
and support of the jumper even though the two practices have become
commonplace around the world. But the referees, led by the 1991 World
Cup final official Derek Bevan, want the tournament organisers to allow
players to support the jumpers.

* REFEREE Steve Dunn, at the centre of the controversial turning-point
of Bolton's play-off victory over Wolves on Wednesday night, yesterday
declared he was right to allow John McGinlay to stay on the field and
score the clinching goal.
The Scot appeared to throw a punch at Wolves striker David Kelly when
Bolton were leading by the forward's first goal. But referee Dunn merely
cautioned both players for the skirmish -- freeing McGinlay to go on and
score the goal that took Bolton through to a Wembley final with Reading
on May 29.

ROY Aitken was last night appointed manager of Aberdeen -- and
immediately thanked the man he replaced, Willie Miller, for giving him
the opportunity to further his career at Pittodrie.
The announcement was made as Aberdeen face two of the most important
games in their 92-year history, games which will determine if they are
demoted from top-flight football for the first time.
The appointment of Aitken will be a major boost to the players, who
have shown considerable commitment to him during his 12 weeks as
caretaker manager, and to the fans who have been eager to see his
position made permanent.
Aitken took over the reins as Aberdeen propped up the premier
division, but he successfully guided them off the bottom with the reward
of an opportunity to avoid relegation in a two-leg play-off against
Dunfermline, at home on Sunday and away on Thursday.
After his appointment Aitken said he was looking no further than these
two games and any changes which might be necessary in the playing or
backroom staff would not be considered until after the relegation issue
had been settled.
''The situation we are in is far too important to have any outside
influences or outside distractions. The main hurdle is getting through
these two games,'' he said.
Aitken said he believed that after easing his way out of the playing
side into the coaching side he was now ready to manage a top club. ''I
have taken a gradual route into it and I have to thank Willie Miller for
having the faith to bring me to a club of the calibre of Aberdeen. At
that time I was looking to get into the coaching side on a more regular
basis, and when he left he encouraged me to give it my best shot and
that is what I have done.''
Announcing the appointment, Aberdeen chairman Ian Donald said: ''Over
the past few critical weeks Roy has demonstrated that he has the
confidence and commitment of the playing staff to make the Dons a major
force in Scottish football.
''The directors believe his appointment will be welcomed throughout
the club and will be warmly received by our fans with whom he has
quickly established his own personal rapport.''
Aitken praised the fans for their reponse during the difficult period
for the club. ''I have said for the past six or eight weeks there has
been a great response from everyone concerned with the club and it shows
the commitment there is among the fans, the players, everyone.
''I am just delighted to get the job. I am very proud to have been
given my first management role with a club of the stature and potential
of the Dons.
''I'm confident we can realise this potential in the seasons ahead,
especially given the commitment and desire shown by the players in
recent games.
''The fans, who displayed their loyalty and backing at a time when we
needed it most, have been inspirational and have provided a positive
environment for future success.
''I said when I arrived my ambition was to spend a long time here and
I think the fans know what I will put into the job. I think they realise
I am someone who will give it his best shot.''

SCOTLAND'S football fans will be given the opportunity to contribute
to the history of the game by helping to build the final phase of
Hampden Park -- the new South Stand which will hold 17,500 and bring the
capacity of the ground to around 53,000.
The cost of building the stand will be #18m and more than half of that
money is now in place. The dream is a Hampden which will be among the
great stadiums in Europe, and that means re-creating the spirit of those
pioneers of almost 100 years ago, who built the biggest and most
technically advanced stadium in the world.
Launching a debenture scheme yesterday, National Stadium director
Austin Reilly said: ''The concept of debenture initiatives is not new,
with successful projects already completed in football and rugby, but
here is a truly unique project where the fans can play a vital and very
public role in the further development of Scotland's national football
stadium.
''Queen's Park, the SFA, the Scottish League, the Football Trust, and
local and national government are all actively behind the redevelopment
plans and a positive reaction to the debenture scheme will give us the
opportunity to provide the country with a football stadium to match the
best in Europe.
''We are asking the fans to register in large numbers to demonstrate
their support. At the moment, we do not know what the cost will be, but
after a period, we will approach a number of the fans to seek their
views on various aspects. They will be consulted on cost, where the
debenture seats will be, and what they will expect in terms of
facilities.''
I understand, however, that when it comes down to settling on the
cost, fans will be asked to pay between #600 and #1000.
While many will want to take advantage of the scheme, it is worth
considering that Scottish football fans have already forked out plenty
of cash on their clubs.
The biggest supports follow Rangers, Celtic, Hearts and Aberdeen.
Rangers fans have already been asked for up to #399 each for next season
as part of their ''Ready For The Future'' campaign, Celtic have recently
had a share issue, Aberdeen are considering the same, while Hearts have
also asked their fans to put their hands in their pockets.
A major advertising campaign will be launched today which will promote
the pre-registration period. Fans can also call the Hampden Hotline
freephone number 0800 585498.
Reilly said: ''There will be only a limited number of debenture seats
available through the scheme and, with that in mind, we are asking
people to pre-register an interest so that we can provide them with a
free registration pack containing all the relevant details.''
The Hampden debenture will guarantee the right to tickets for all
ventures at the ground -- international matches, Scottish and League Cup
matches, concerts, and exhibitions.
Jim Farry, chief executive of the SFA, said: ''We are aiming to raise
#5m from fans and businesses and we are absolutely certain demand will
exceed supply. We are very confident and optimistic about this.''
''There are comparisons between this scheme and the one at
Murrayfield, but they are not the same. At Murrayfield the fans were
asked to come in right at the start of re-building, but we have already
completed two-thirds of the work at Hampden.''
The Murrayfield debenture scheme has already raised #32m, but those
who support club rugby do not have anything like the outlay of their
football counterparts. It does not cost much to follow rugby on a weekly
basis, so the fans of the oval ball game had money to spend on something
special, like a guarantee of a seat at the super new Murrayfield.
Also for major rugby internationals, Murrayfield is always a 67,500
sell out. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for football at
Hampden.
However, the football authorities have to be applauded for their
thinking and everyone should hope that the Hampden plan is a success.
After all it is the national stadium and football is the national sport.
Said Farry: ''The SFA's ambition is that Hampden, when completed, will
be on the very exclusive UEFA list of five-star stadiums. If you are on
that then you can host all of their major finals.''
To gain a UEFA five-star listing, the stadium must have a helipad, an
in-house hospital, and secure underground parking for when heads of
state and other dignitaries attend events.

RANGERS would like nothing better than to announce that both Paul
Gascoigne and Florin Raducioiu will sign on before this weekend is over,
but the Ibrox club continue to be frustrated in their bold and ambitious
attempts to piece together a side capable of being Champions' League
contenders.
Walter Smith was back in Rome on Wednesday trying to bring the #4.5m
transfer of Gascoigne from Lazio to Rangers closer to reality, but the
player's arrival in Glasgow is not imminent. The same applies to the
Romanian, Raducioiu.
Rangers are still favourites to sign Gascoigne although contrary to
reports he has not resolved his differences with Lazio. It is believed
the player is seeking a #1m settlement for the two years left on his
contract with the Italian club. His agents, Mel Stein and Len Lazarus,
have been working towards that. I understand Lazio have offered
#300,000.
It is my information that Lazio are still in the mood to haggle over
the amount for a player who has given them little productivity because
of long-term injury. Lazio have the power to banish Gascoigne to the
reserves for the rest of his contract.
Last night the player failed to turn up for a training match against
Tuscan side Grosseto ahead of Sunday's Serie A action. Lazio coach
Zdenek Zeman said: ''The club may take disciplinary action, but I want
to talk with him first.''
Smith and his right-hand man, Archie Knox, have been checking
Raducioiu since they watched him play for Romania in the World Cup
finals. Espanol want #2.5m for 25-year-old Raducioiu.
Rangers might run into difficulty in trying to sign another another
player from outwith the European Community. Currently all 10 work
permits allocated to Scottish football are in use -- no club can have
more than two -- and Scottish League secretary Peter Donald said
yesterday: ''It would seem Rangers would have to rely on other clubs, or
even themselves, to release a current holder of a work permit. Even then
they would not necessarily be guaranteed first place if another club
have ambitions of bringing in a non-European Community player.''
The 10 players holding permits are Rudi Vata (Celtic), Jerren Nixon
and Gordan Petric (both Dundee United), Dragoje Lekovic (Kilmarnock),
Tony Rougier (Raith Rovers), Dusan Vrto (Dundee), Arnold Dwarika (East
Fife), Henry Stoute and Dave Alleyne (both Meadowbank Thistle), and of
course Rangers' own Alexei Mikhailichenko.
It is in Rangers' favour that Nixon has been put up for sale and
Petric is not certain to relish life in the first division, but it would
be most frustrating for the Ibrox side if they were to have their
attempt to bring talent into Scottish football blocked because of East
Fife or Meadowbank.
It can be assumed that neither Smith nor Rangers' chairman David
Murray would have gone as far as to say they are willing to meet
Espanol's price for Raducioiu unless they were confident of gaining a
permit. It could be they are waiting until July when Mikhailichenko will
have worked here four years and thus be exempt.

* ALLAN Lamb and Kevin Curran both chalked up unbeaten centuries as
Britannic Assurance County Championship leaders Northamptonshire
recovered from a shaky start to take control against Surrey at the
County Ground yesterday.
And defending champions Warwickshire also carved out a strong position
to spoil the opening-day party at Durham's Chester-le-Street stadium,
which was staging championship cricket for the first time.
Veteran Surrey seamer Tony Pigott took two wickets in as many overs to
leave Northants reeling at 101 for four -- but Lamb and Curran guided
them to 363 without further loss by the close.
Skipper Lamb, who was 150 not out, reached his hundred in 203 minutes
off 158 balls with sixteen 4s while Curran, unbeaten on 111, took 215
minutes and 202 deliveries to reach the milestone, which included 18
boundaries.

Hiroshima
SCOTLAND may never quite have managed to conquer the world in a
footballing sense, but the national team will deserve no little praise
if they can recuperate quickly enough from the rigours of a 21-hour
journey to Japan to win the Kirin Cup.
Craig Brown's squad landed in Hiroshima last night, briefly parted
from the hampers containing the team kit, but in the end the pool
settled well in what for most is an uncharted territory.
There has been vociferous criticism of the whole event from those at
home who fail to see what benefit can possibly be derived from taking,
in effect, a skeleton group to the Far East. Certainly, the original
notion that this trip would provide useful match practice ahead of the
European Championship qualifying match against the Faroe Islands on June
7, has long since been discredited due to the withdrawal of most of our
leading players.
Yet the manager insists that it remains a worthwhile exercise.
''Everything is OK. We had a good flight over and now that we have had a
nice meal the players are just relaxing and going for an early night,''
said Brown.
''I never had any qualms about the travelling involved, even though
some people had their doubts. Other countries do it because it's part
and parcel of the modern game. I also spoke to Gary Lineker before we
came here and he assured me that going to Japan would be no problem. The
lads will take a day to adjust and then they'll be ready for action.''
While the only man absolutely guaranteed to start Sunday's opener
against Japan is Jim Leighton, who has been made captain, his Hibs
colleague Darren Jackson must also be regarded as a banker selection for
Brown. He played with distinction against both Russia and San Marino in
Scotland's last two matches despite being asked to perform relatively
thankless tasks.
It seems unlikely that he will be left out, so the real question is
whether he will be joined in attack by Chelsea's John Spencer or John
Robertson, so often a rival of Jackson's when he has played for Hearts
in Edinburgh derbies.
Robertson gives every impression that he is more than ready to try to
resurrect an international career which had seemed in terminal decline.
''I have got the chance to represent my country again by coming here
and if I do get to play then it will be what I have been craving for the
last two years,'' said Robertson, whose previous appearance was against
Estonia in 1993 when he received his eleventh cap.
''Now the manager has given me that chance, if I am selected for
either Sunday's game or the game against Equador on Wednesday, then it
is up to me to try to do well.''

HAMILTON striker Peter Duffield could be set for a #200,000 move to
Bristol City. Manager Joe Jordan had Duffield screened last week during
Accies' 0-0 draw with Raith Rovers at Firhill and the former Hearts
manager is poised to make an offer as he prepares to take his club back
out of the second division.
City managed to net only 42 goals in 46 league games this season --
the second worst record in the first division -- and that lack of
strike-power sent them down.
Hamilton manager Iain Munro paid out just #35,000 to sign 26-year-old
Duffield from Sheffield United in September, 1993, and he has rattled in
44 goals over two seasons.
Partick Thistle have also been linked with the Middlesbrough-born
striker, but Duffield has made it clear he would prefer to return to
England.
However, Jordan may still face competition from fellow second division
club Rotherham, who also had a scout at Firhill.

Manchester United player Steve Paterson. The Huntly manager has won a
championship titles with his previous three clubs, Forres as a player,
Elgin and Huntly.
Former Leicester City, Everton and Scotland midfielder Ian Wilson,
recently returned from Japan, and ex-West Ham and Scotland defender Ray
Stewart are two possible candidates for the Huntly vacancy.

* Iain Munro has won his appeal against a #200 fine by the SFA.
Munro was censured and fined by the general purposes committee for his
comments following a game against Stranraer earlier this year. He had
been upset at more than 60 fouls being awarded during the game and had
suggested that more protection had to be given to the players.
But Munro stressed that he was not criticising any person, and that he
was attempting to back the SFA's call for fair play.

MANCHESTER United's FA Cup final preparations were rocked for the
second time in two days yesterday when winger Andrei Kanchelskis
announced that he could no longer play for Alex Ferguson.
After speculation that Manchester City had put Ferguson's assistant,
Brian Kidd, at the top of their wanted list to replace sacked boss Brian
Horton, Kanchelskis declared that he must leave United.
The Ukrainian has not featured in the United team since returning from
international duty last month suffering from a mystery stomach problem.
''Andrei loves the club, the players and the fans, but he cannot work
with the manager,'' said his agent, Grigory Esaylenko. ''It's a personal
thing, man to man, and his heart is not in it. He asks every day if he
can leave, but the manager says no. It is not a good situation.''
Ferguson was upset that the story had broken so close to the cup
final, after feeling that he had made his peace with Kanchelskis -- ''I
must say he's picked the right time, hasn't he?
''We spoke to him and his agent last week, and I thought we'd thrashed
it out.''
Ferguson clearly does not want Kanchelskis to leave, but he is in no
mood to cause an early confrontation with the player, who will join up
with the rest of the United party before tomorrow's game.
''I'm off on holiday next week and we'll wait and see what happens
over the summer,'' Ferguson added. ''Andrei is very much in my plans for
the future of Manchester United.''

CELTIC flew off to Milan to begin their Tennents Scottish Cup final
build-up, but it was business as usual for their opponents, Airdrie, who
were pounding a familiar beat in Strathclyde Park yesterday, taking time
out to show off their new strip which will be worn for the first time in
the final a week tomorrow.
The club can dress them up as much as they like, but underneath the
new rig-outs nothing will have changed. The same players who took
Airdrie to success in the B&amp;Q Cup and who almost managed a play-off
place in the first division championship race will be on duty at Hampden
next week, determined to go one better than the last time they played a
cup final at the national stadium.
They lost 2-1 to Rangers in the '92 final, which remains as the
biggest match in which any of the Airdrie players had been involved. In
fact, it was too much for some of them and yesterday Jimmy Boyle, a
veteran of Hampden, having played there for Queen's Park in 142
consecutive games, admitted the team did not go into the final equipped
with enough self-belief.
''We went into the game against Rangers maybe thinking that we
wouldn't really win,'' he said. ''But it won't be like that this time.
''I remember I was very nervous, but I am now one of six Airdrie
players who have played in a Scottish Cup final, while Celtic could have
four at the most. I think the experience of those who have been there
before could be vital.''
Boyle is a product of the Celtic Boys' Club system, and while it would
not have been difficult to convince his famly to support Airdrie against
Rangers, he has had to work harder this time. However, his brother
Stephen -- ''he's a Celtic fan'' -- has agreed to sit in the Airdrie
section of the stadium next week.
Apart from Boyle, Jimmy Sandison, John Martin, Alan Lawrence, Andy
Smith, and Sandy Stewart are survivors from the last final. Celtic's Pat
Bonner, Tommy Boyd -- while with Motherwell -- Andy Walker and Paul
McStay all played in finals. Peter Grant has also appeared in a cup
final, but it is not known yet whether or not he will recover from
injury in time to play against Airdrie.

GLOUCESTERSHIRE, the surprise package of the season so far, face a
Benson and Hedges Cup showdown with arch rivals Somerset. Jack Russell's
team were 50-1 outsiders for the competition a month ago, but they won
all five group games to guarantee a home draw in the quarter-finals --
and their reward could hardly be more appealing.
Gloucestershire have already beaten their West Country neighbours in a
Sunday League fixture at Taunton. And the atmosphere in Bristol on
quarter-final day -- Tuesday, May 30 -- should be electrifying.
Last year's cup runners-up Worcestershire face a tough trip to
Headingley where they have already lost in the competition once this
season. Yorkshire beat them by six wickets there last month, despite a
century from Graeme Hick, on their way to topping Group B.
''They are the one team to have beaten us in one-day cricket so far
this season,'' said Worcestershire coach David Houghton. ''I would have
preferred us to play someone from a different group but if we perform to
our potential we should be more than a match for them.''
Kent, who have won nothing since lifting both the Benson and Hedges
Cup and county championship in 1978, have been drawn at home to
Middlesex. The other quarter-final sees Lancashire take on
Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford.

EUAN Stewart has joined the list of dissatisfied Scottish swimmers and
has abandoned plans to try to fulfil an Olympic dream in Atlanta next
summer.
The 25-year-old from Dundee, who joined the City of Glasgow team as a
full-timer at the start of this season, said: ''Nothing has gone right
for me recently and I've had enough. It's unlikely that I'll be back.''
Stewart, the Scottish butterfly champion, blames lack of support from
within Scottish swimming as the reason behind his decision to quit.
''It's diabolical,'' he claimed. ''I was turned down for a Sports Aid
grant and was so hard up that I had to survive on ham sandwiches at a
recent meet in Leeds.''
He had hoped that the switch to Glasgow would enhance his prospects,
but he swam poorly at last month's Multi-Nations Tournament in
Edinburgh. Disheartened, he pulled out of the following week's European
championship trials.
Still living in Glasgow, he has now started applying for jobs, and
admitted: ''It's unlikely that I'll return to swimming.''

THE annual season of masochism and machismo, otherwise known as the
Isle of Jura Scottish Peaks Race, has opened.
A total of 51 yachts was mustered at Oban last night for the world's
largest race of its kind. At noon today they launch a Hebridean odyssey
which will carry them some 160 miles, via Mull, Jura, and Arran, to the
finish at Troon Marina.
Last year's Class 2 (for monohulls) winning skipper, Ross Hobson, is
tipped to win overall, having stepped up to an F40 catamaran, Fingers
Crossed. His biggest rival may be Curly Mills, whose Antigua Cat, Dilly
Dream, has Dr Findlay, aka David Rintoul, as a crewman, raising funds
for Amnesty International.
Class 2 favourite is Eos, a 51-foot Beneteau, whose crew includes
Round the World race skipper Paul Jeffes, one of the consultants on
Scotland's Largs-based Admiral's Cup bid.
Landfall in Ayrshire is at the mercy of wind, weather, and tide -- and
the ability of each crew's two athletes to negotiate nearly 60 miles of
mountain running and some 11,000 feet of ascent and descent -- often
while recovering from sea sickness.
The athletes face ascents of Ben More (22 miles/966 metres), the Paps
of Jura (18/784), and Goat Fell (18/874) -- their sole reward being a
plaque and a few drams of sustenance from the sponsors, Whyte and
Mackay.

Dalmahoy
WILLIAM Guy went to the same public school, Strathallan, as Colin
Montgomerie but since they left that seat of learning their golfing
fortunes could not have followed more divergent paths -- Guy struggling
to make his way in the game, Montgomerie, three times a millionaire on
European tournament earnings alone.
Yesterday, in the first round of the Tartan Special Scottish
Professional championship at Dalmahoy, Guy's 69 left him tied with
Andrew Oldcorn only a stroke behind the leader, Russell Weir, and raised
his hopes of cutting a reasonable slice of the #65,000 prize fund.
Until this week from five other outings, the 27-year-old Buchanan
Castle professional had won only #1800 -- and that for finishing sixth
in the Kenya Open.
Guy was even deprived of #5 of that recently in Las Palmas, where he
was threatened and robbed by a knife-wielding mugger who also struck him
in the left eye. Guy feared his sight might have been permanently
impaired but a subsequent examination found, to his relief, that no
serious damage had been inflicted.
''I'm trying to qualify for the main Tour through the Challenge Tour,
after missing out for my card in a play-off in last autumn's school, and
that costs about #1000 a week,'' Guy explained, although he does have
financial support from a Southport businessman he met while playing in a
pro-am.
Guy completed a good morning's work with a birdie at the 480-yard
ninth, the sixth of his round, although he had to hole a second putt of
six feet after he had reached the green with a No.3 wood shot into the
hailstorm which had cost him bogeys at the two previous holes.
Weir has won everything on the Tartan Tour worth winning except this
championship, the flagship event, but the 43-year-old Dunoon
professional made a possible move towards improving on two runner-up
finishes with his 68, four under par. Weir, playing the outward half
last in a testing westerly wind which blew the occasional rain squall
over the 6677-yard West course, finished with two of five birdies.
First, he chipped in from 15 yards after his approach had spun off the
eighth green and then having hit a No.2 iron to 10 feet left the eagle
putt hovering on the hole's rim.
Whereupon Weir, feeling his legs tired and anxious to put his feet up,
immediately left to catch a ferry home. ''I'm overweight and old,'' he
reflected wryly over his car phone. ''It's not for want of trying I
haven't won this title -- indeed, perhaps I've tried too hard and so put
too much pressure on myself.''
Oldcorn, a very late starter, had the worst of the weather, but wetter
and even colder than before in a wind from the most difficult direction.
The course may not be as unforgiving as St Mellion, where Oldcorn on
Sunday finished equal fourth, but the conditions were more unpleasant
and he was satisfied with this start.
Rather as Adam Hunter had summed up his 72 so Oldcorn did his score:
''It was a better working round than a ball-striking one.'' Ultimately
the glue that held his score together was formed by the four substantial
single putts he made in five holes from the thirteenth, two each for
pars at birdies.
The ninth proved even more valuable for the holder, Andrew Coltart. He
was ''playing along very averagely'' when from a downhill lie he struck
a No.4 iron shot of 199 yards to within 25 feet for an eagle 3 and a 70,
so that he played the three par-5s -- the adjoining first and tenth both
uphill but down wind -- in four under.
Among the others on 70 was Alan Tait who played alongside Coltart. He
complained of inconsistent putting from genuine holing-out range, but
Tait, aged 26, who has set three course records -- Carnoustie (64), The
Queen's at Gleneagles Hotel (63), and Buchanan Castle (62) -- had single
putts for four of his five gains.
68 -- R Weir (Cowal).
69 -- W Guy (Buchanan Castle), A Oldcorn (Dalmahoy Hotel).
70 -- A Coltart (Thornhill), A Tait (Cawder), K Campbell
(Machrihanish), D McKay (Ladybank), D Thomson (Kings Links), B Marchbank
(Marchbank Golf Enterprises).
71 -- L Vannet (Carnoustie), A Crerar (Downfield), S Harrier (Craigie
Hill), I Collins (Stirling) S MacPherson (Felixstowe Ferry), S Syme
(Glenrothes), I Young (Braid Hills), J Greaves (Glasgow), S Martin
(North Engineering), C Innes (Golfanlage Schloss), S Stephen (Braid
Hills), D Drysdale (Dunbar).
72 -- P Wardell (Longniddry), A Hunter (Strathclyde Park), T Coles
(King James VI), S Callan (Dalmahoy), B Davidson (Kings Links), R Aitken
(Barassie), G Redford (Turnberry Hotel), A Hogg (Golf Club Chieming), S
Henderson (Kings Links), R Arnott (Caddy Shack), G Harvey (Grangemouth).
73 -- J McCreadie (Buchanan Castle), F Mann (Musselburgh), C Gillies
(Falkirk), K Stables (Montrose), B Lockie (Barassie), I Bratton (Cruden
Bay), S Craig (Dunfermline), S Kerr (Renfrew), G Jack (Kirriemuir), G

<TEXT>
LONDONER Peter Mitchell shot a six-under-par 66 to lead the field at
the Spanish Open in Madrid yesterday -- and then spoke out in defence of
the European Tour.
Seve Ballesteros (70), Jose Maria Olazabal (73) and Colin Montgomerie
(70), with backing from Nick Faldo in the United States, have condemned
the European Tour as having too many players and lacking quality. But
Mitchell, eighteenth in the order of merit last year, disagrees.
''Everybody has their own point of view,'' he said. ''It's okay for
the superstars to say what they like. They have no worries, but there
are guys out there who have no money, no sponsorship. It can cost them a
grand (#1000) a week just to play and it's a different ball game at that
level.
''Those players who have got millions and get exemptions all over the
world can do what they want to do. They are not going to struggle.''
Told that the superstars are worried about sponsors dropping out,
Mitchell replied: ''If the top players do not play in all the European
tournaments and go off to America we shall not have such good
sponsorship.''
Mitchell, reluctant to mention names, was clearly critical of Faldo,
now playing regularly in the United States, and of Ballesteros,
Olazabal, and Woosnam, who have hinted they may follow suit. ''We would
have a great tour if all the top players played over here,'' said the
37-year-old.
Ken Schofield, executive director of the European Tour, also hit back
at the criticism.
Falso had said: ''We need new blood. After all, we are all 37 or 38
and in a few more years when we are gone, there will be a massive void
on the Tour.''
But Schofield responded: ''That doesn't apply to Colin Montgomerie and
Jose Maria Olazabal. Monty has been No.1 in Europe for the past two
years while Jose Maria has won the US Masters -- and they are not 37 or
38.
''Not everyone can be a superstar. But every player is trying his
hardest to win and I don't believe there is a comfort zone. And it
wasn't so long ago that Nick Faldo was singing the praises of Peter
Baker and Robert Karlsson as players of the future, the type we need on
the Tour.''
As for Faldo's worry about the loss of three major sponsors, Schofield
said: ''We have lost sponsors, it is true, but overall we have a net
gain in sponsors.''
Ever cheerful, Mitchell was happier to talk about his round. His three
eagles came at the 507-yard fourth where he holed from a greenside
bunker, 538-yard seventh where he hit his second shot to five feet with
a No.7 iron and 477-yard twelfth where he was on the green in two and
holed out from eight feet. He also chipped in from 25 feet for a birdie
at the eighth.
Paisley's Stephen McAllister was the best-placed Scot on 69. Leading
scores (British or Irish unless stated):
66 -- P Mitchell.
67 -- I Garrido (Spain).
68 -- J Rivero (Spain), C Rocca (Italy), P Price.
69 -- B Lane, H Clark, J Sandelin (Sweden), M Mackenzie, R Goosen (S
Africa), W Riley (Australia), E Darcy, G Levenson (SA), J Townsend (US),
S McAllister, M Roe, M Harwood (Australia), D Gilford, P Baker, V
Fernandez (Argentina), J Robson.
Other scores included: 70 -- C Montgomerie, S Ballesteros (Spain), S
Torrance. 71 -- G Brand Jr, B Langer (Germany). 73 -- P Lawrie, R
Drummond, P O'Malley (Australia). 74 -- G Orr, M Miller. 75 -- S Lyle, I
Woosnam, B Gallacher. 76 77 -- C Cassells.
* STEPHEN Gallacher is among the favourites for the English amateur
strokeplay championship which begins at Hillside, Southport, today.
Gallacher, 20, winner of the European title last year, has already
this season added the Scottish Champion of Champions and Lytham Trophy
crowns to his collection and looks a certainty to make his Walker Cup
debut at Porthcawl in August.

* TONIGHT is definitely the night for rock'n'rollers who have
gallantly served their full term before the mast. Fats Domino would have
headed the list if only he hadn't been felled by illness. But there is
still a bundle of stoic musical veterans to choose from.
John Mayall brings his latest group of Bluesbreakers to town at the
Garage at 7pm, 30-odd years after he first began to assemble his
blues-powered bands from the flower of young British musical talent. But
while Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Jack Bruce are long gone, the
venerable Mayall's mastery of the zappier end of the genre continues
unabated.
Castlemilk's noble and tireless musical toilers at C Sharp Music
Factory, located in Castlemilk Community Centre, Castlemilk Drive,
continue their three-day event with an 8pm show by boogie-merchants
Climax Blues Band. Support tonight is from local hero Billy Rivers.
Naturally, however, there are new contenders on tonight's Mayfest
musical menu. Supergrass is a hotly-tipped teenaged power trio which
will be bringing its meaty, guitar-driven riffs and its mutton-chop
side-whiskers to the Plaza at 7pm. .
Finally, a reminder of another postponement: NVA won't be creating
Stormy Waters tonight and tomorrow. It should go ahead on July 21 and
22.

US Open champion Ernie Els and Brad Faxon were paired together
yesterday in the first round of the Buick Westchester Classic, with
Faxon leading the tournament at three under par and Els a stroke behind
as they started their final hole of the day, the par five ninth, writes
Robinson Holloway.
A few minutes later, as they checked their scorecards, Els was the
leader at three under and Faxon was fuming while signing for a 9 on that
last hole. Faxon made a double bogey on the hole, but was given a
two-stroke penalty for hitting the wrong ball.
Els' lead held up for almost the entire round, until little known
American Doug Martin eagled the eighteenth to move to four under par 67,
one stroke ahead of Els and four others.
Nick Faldo, who enjoys this course and whose game should suit it
perfectly, shot a one under par round of 70 to finish two strokes off
the lead. Leading scorers:
67 -- D Martin.
68 -- E Els (SA), G Waite (NZ), M McCullough, B Fleisher, M Hulbert.
69 -- J Furyk, F Allem (SA), L Rinker, C Burroughs, M Dawson, D Duval,
C Beck, B McCallister, P Azinger, C Perry, D Martin, J Carter.
70 -- M Reid, C Byrum, V Singh (Fiji), T Lehman, C Stadler, D Pooley,
O Uresti, B Clampett, B Bryant, S Ford, N Faldo (Eng), J Renner, H
Twitty, B Kamm, D Paulson, J Wilson.

Ross Finlay finds a manufacturer who speaks his language
ANYONE put off considering the Hyundai Accent 1.3-litre Coupe, because
the front-end styling makes it look like a late arrival at Burl Ives's
''Ugly Bug Ball'', should think again. The entry-level car of the whole
Hyundai range will never win a concours d'elegance award, but it is
lively and responsive, very roomy despite its compact appearance, and it
combines good economy returns with rip-snorting performance for an
unassuming 1300.
Hyundai, the largest of the Korean car companies, is part of an
immense business conglomerate which started in 1940 as a modest repair
workshop, and now has world-wide annual sales of more than #45 billion.
While vehicle building is only part of its activities -- shipbuilding,
electronics, aerospace and petrochemicals have their own divisions --
its single-site factory at Ulsan is the largest production unit in the
whole world motor industry.
Like all Korean manufacturers, Hyundai originally tapped foreign
sources for most of its cars' mechanical elements. The Accent is the
first one which counts as a genuine home-grown product. In the
showrooms, it may take the place of the rather dull X2 model, but the
two cars have no hardware in common.
The 1.3i three-door Coupe is the sparsely equipped base model of the
Accent range. Selling at #6899, the test car had such features as a
digital clock, remote fuel filler release, cigarette lighter and
instrument light dimmer, and that was pretty much that as far as its
non-essential equipment went. No radio, although a wing-mounted
retractable aerial was provided, no airbag, no steering column height
adjustment, no alarm system, no central locking, simple cabin trim and
absolutely no frills at all, unless you count the ''glitter'' effect on
the rear-end badging. And yet, this dumpy-looking little car has a great
deal going for it.
To begin with, the packaging is first class. After I set the driver's
seat to suit my own well-reclined position at the wheel, I could ''sit
behind myself'' with plenty of rear headroom, kneeroom and footroom --
to an extent that made me wonder what other designers of this size of
car think they are playing at. And the Accent does not gain passenger
space at the cost of restricted luggage room, because the boot is both
large and reasonably unobstructed.
Hyundai fits its own Alpha-series engines to the Accent range. The
1.3i has a 12-valve 1341cc unit which peaks at 83bhp and produces its
maximum torque at 3100rpm. Together with a low kerb weight for a
solid-feeling car, and well chosen gear ratios, these figures let the
Coupe romp to 60mph in about 12.5 seconds, storm through the gears, and
reach a test track maximum around 108mph. You can expect fuel
consumption figures like 62mpg at 56mph, 46 at 75 and 39mpg around town.
A good driving position, accurate rack and pinion steering, and
enthusiastic turn-in make the Coupe an unexpectedly spritely performer.
I drove the test car part of the time in Ireland, on climbs and winding
moorland plateau roads often used for rally stages. While the front
wheels would sometimes scrabble a little for grip -- this is not, after
all, set up as a sports car -- the Coupe was great fun to drive, with
secure handling and a dependable stability over the bumps, of which
these roads have an abundance.
Just as impressive, the suspension kept up a good ride quality under
pressure. The Accent was not upset by the dips and humps encountered on
straights and corners alike. And the Hankook tyres kept road noise low.
We tend to regard Korean cars as derivative, but here is one whose
handling, ride, passenger space, performance and economy -- taken as a
combined package -- are right up with the class leaders. If this is what
the Koreans can do when they start with proper in-house designs, then
their ambition to make a massive sales breakthrough by the start of the
new century will be no mere pipe dream.

THE long-term trend towards a reduction in the number of auction
markets in Scotland will continue with some of the smaller markets
disappearing, John Izat, chairman of United Auctions (Scotland) said
yesterday.
Speaking after the company's annual meeting, held at Kildean Market in
Stirling, Mr Izat said that the company was well aware of the importance
of local markets to their farmer shareholders. The company's aim was to
co-operate in improving the auction system in Scotland.
In his annual report the chairman referred to the closure of the
United Auctions mart at Inverness. A financial assessment of the likely
costs of creating a new market there had led to the current agreement to
establish a 50/50 partnership with the board of Dingwall Auction Mart to
operate the market at Dingwall.
The market at Cupar had also been closed but, he said, it was very
close to Perth. Negotiations are continuing for the sale of the Cupar
site and a number of other property sales are expected to be concluded
this year. A substantial bid, subject to planning consent, has been
received for land at Polmaise.
Mr Izat said that the company was conscious of the importance of the
role of their markets in outlying areas. ''We have hung on to our
islands business despite the competition of the new market in Oban,'' he
said. ''Dalmally, as far as we are concerned, is totally secure.''
The new layerage at Oban, established to cater for stock coming in
from the islands, was being fully utilised. That stock was being sold
through Dalmally.
Chief executive Alan McGregor, in his report, said that he hoped that
the latest development at Perth Agricultural Centre would be in
operation by mid-summer. That will include a provision for a small
theatre which will stage an animal show based on the story of Highland
livestock.
Fergus Wood, who runs a similar venture on the story of sheep at
Aberfoyle, has been engaged to operate the Perth show.
Adjacent to the theatre will be an animal farm where visitors will be
able to see the livestock after the show. Scottish Enterprise Tayside is
backing the project which is seen as an important tourist development
for the area.
On the animal welfare front United Auctions has run the first of two
planned courses on stock-handling for staff at Stirling and Perth. It
also plans to produce a policy document on animal welfare which will
include material from animal health inspectors and the RSPCA.
The company results, declared earlier this month, show net trading
profits of #837,339 after interest, compared with #782,551 last year.
The meeting approved payment of a dividend of 20p a share.
In the terms of a special resolution passed yesterday the company is
to seek re-registration as a public limited company, which will allow
its shares to be traded on the alternative investment market (AIM) which
is being created specifically for dealing in the shares of smaller
companies.
There will also be a bonus issue of two new Ordinary shares for every
Ordinary share currently held.

A MINI Highland Show of Suffolk sheep will be on display at the
North-east Suffolk Club's ambitious first-time competition at Thainstone
Agricultural Centre, Inverurie, on Saturday, June 10.
As most British quality Suffolk breeders farm in the North-east many
prime animals will be on show before the Highland Show and the main
Suffolk sales in July at Stoneleigh and Edinburgh.
Club chairman Harry Emslie Jr said that the sponsorship of #1400 has
been obtained for prizes in the 10 classes (clipped and unclipped) for
pedigree breeders and four classes for commercial lamb producers, two on
the hoof and two on the hook.
There will be trophies for the champion and reserve and engraved
glasses for class prizes. The main sponsors are J Bibby Agriculture
Limited. Subsidiary sponsors are Intervet and Sherrat Farm Supplies.
Two former Suffolk breeders are judges -- Arnott Barron and Sam
Forrest. The commercial judge is Inverurie butcher Sandy Mitchell.
Entries close on Thursday, June 1, with Suffolk club secretary Fiona
Bruce, Tillyeve Cottage, Udny, Aberdeenshire. Telephone 01651 842616.

THE Annan-based market firm of Thomson Roddick &amp; Laurie has put
forward proposals for a 50/50 merger with the Castle Douglas market
company Wallets Marts.
Thomson Roddick &amp; Laurie director John Thomson has said that an
amicable alliance between the two would provide a strong auction and
land agency business based in the south-west of Scotland.
Wallets is already the subject of a #1m takeover bid by James Craig of
Ayr, but shareholders have been advised by the board to make no response
to that offer.
Closer working with Harrison &amp; Hetherington of Carlisle has also been
considered as a possible way forward.

THE Macaulay Land Use Research Institute in Aberdeen has teamed up
with its Japanese counterpart to study similarities in the emission of
methane from paddy fields and Scottish peatlands.
''Japan is the world-leader in paddy-field methane research,'' said
the Macaulay's Dr Steve Chapman. ''They are anxious to reduce the
release of methane without also having to reduce the production of
essential food.
''We have been looking at methane emissions from natural wetlands in
the UK, including the relationship between emission levels and the
existence of trees and the evidence to date is that methane release is
lower in wetlands where there are trees.''

FARMER'S daughter Liz Garner (right) is the first full-time Farm
Conservation Adviser appointed by Ayrshire and Arran Farming and
Wildlife Advisory Group. With her appointment the group now has a
network of 19 advisers covering all of Scotland.
''Farmers in Ayrshire now have an opportunity for renewal -- a chance
to put something back into the land for future generations and leave
things better than they find them,'' said John Scott, chairman of the
Ayrshire and Arran FWAG, at a meeting at Culzean Castle.
Harvey Leckie of SmithKline Beecham, one of the corporate donors
supporting the Ayrshire branch, said that the largest proportion of land
in Ayrshire was associated with farming in one way or another.
''It is clear that the provision of advice and assistance from the new
adviser will make a significant contribution for the benefit fo future
generations and for the wildlife of this area.''
Ms Garner studied rural environmental sciences before completing an
MSc in ecology at Bangor. She has been a member of three expeditions to
St Kilda undertaking research work on the feral Soay Sheep population.

A STRONGER dollar, particularly against the mark, where it broke
through a key resistance point, fed through to sterling which rose by
0.6 on a trade-weighted basis to 85.1.
The dollar is thought to be in a long-term uptrend which should
provide some ongoing support for the pound.
Against the mark the pound jumped over two pfennigs to DM2.2773. It
appears to be well supported as it continues to consolidate in a
DM2.2400-DM2.2850 trading range. However, against the richer dollar, it
lost over half-a-cent to $1.5630. It shrugged off the surprise dip in
April retail sales.
Elsewhere, the French franc was steady after its recent sell-off as
the market digested President Chirac's new cabinet appointments.

BURTON Group is steadily trying to move its business upmarket with
less focus on discounted prices. By building its brand integrity it
hopes to generate better margins and thus increase its profits. In line
with other successful retailers such as arch rival Marks &amp; Spencer, it
is working more closely with a smaller number of key suppliers which
leads to a more efficient, customer-focused business.
There are some signs that this strategy is beginning to pay off
although the company itself would admit that it has a long way to go
fully to satisfy both its customers and its shareholders. ''Building the
way back is very hard,'' said chairman Sir John Hoskyns.
Profits in the six months were up strongly to #61.5m before tax and
exceptional items to #61.5m against #35.1m previously. This was achieved
despite a 0.7% decline in overall turnover to #1035.7m. Gross margins
were 3.6% better in the first half.
Earnings per share were 3.3p before the exceptional item, up from
1.9p. Despite the strong performance the management is not complacent.
It is cautious about trading in the second half given the strong
comparative performance for last year and the continued fragility of
consumer confidence. So the interim dividend has been held at 1p.
The financial position of the group continues to strengthen. Despite a
busy store refurbishment programme there was a net cash inflow in the
first half of #61.4m compared with an outflow of #12m previously. At the
half-year net debt was just #19.2m, equivalent to gearing of just 2%.
Group capital expenditure for the full year is expected to be slightly
ahead of depreciation at around #115m.
Debenhams continues to be the jewel in the crown. Its sales were 4.5%
higher in the period. The Debenhams brand is being developed in its own
right across the Classic home furnishings range and Casual Club clothing
merchandise. A new store is to open in Leeds and further opportunities
are being explored in both out-of-town and town centre locations.
Ideally the company would like to add another 12 stores by the year
2000 taking the total to 100. Increasingly Debenhans is seen as an
attractive anchor store for new retail developments.
Within the multiple chains, which include Dorothy Perkins, Etam, Top
Shop, Principles and Burtons, the store refit and changes in merchandise
ranges toward more classic lines and away from high fashion is begining
to feed through to the bottom line.
It is taking time for customers changes in Dorothy Perkins smaller
catchment areas and the repositioning of Burtons menswear is taking
longer to achieve. This was behind the 4.5% drop in sales in the ongoing
Multiples business. Experiments are continuing with customer loyalty
schemes and the development of stand alone shops for its successful own
brands.
The encouraging trading statement prompted City analysts to upgrade
their annual profit forecasts and pushed up Burton Group shares by
5[1/2]p to 85p.

LONDON Life, one of the oldest life insurance companies, has decided
not to take on any more new business and to axe its marketing operation,
as a result of increasing competition in the industry.
It will become a caretaker operation, looking after the 90,000
policyholders on its books and their #2000m investments. The company
stressed that policyholders' investments were ''absolutely safe'' and
all existing contractual rights would continue to be met in full.
However, the move will send a frisson of fear through the life
insurance industry, which is suffering from over-capacity. Closures
among the smaller companies are widely expected. ManuLife recently
pulled out of the UK market.
''There is absolutely no cause for policyholders to be concerned,''
said London Life chief executive Jim Divers.
The company is owned by a much larger and financially very strong
group, Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP). Mr Divers said it
stood full square behind London Life.
Closing the company to further funds should not have any significant
impact on future bonus rates or surrender values on with-profits
policies.
However, Mr Divers agreed that the lack of inflow of new money into
the life fund could have some impact on investment performance. Having
an inflow makes it easier for the investment manager. Without this he
would normally have to pursue a more conservative investment strategy to
avoid increased volatility but this will be less necessary with AMP
behind the compnay. Bonuses will also benfit from the company having
much lower expenses.
The fund will continue to be managed by AMP's investment managers.
Now 460 jobs at London Life will go, with all its 14 sales offices
closing. The only Scottish branch, in Glasgow, employs eight full-time
staff. However the company expects most redundancies will be voluntary.
Full disclosure of commissions from the beginning of the year was the
final straw for London Life by exacerbating an already difficult market.
Its sales, which were concentrated in single premium business, suffered
a sharp fall last year and the trend has continued into 1995.
The company has a chequered history, having to be rescued by AMP in
1989 after it had tried to expand too fast. AMP injected #50m into the
life fund in 1992. Since then London Life has tried to revive itself
through new products and reducing expenses but its size and background
were against it.
A review, assisted by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, concluded that sales
were unlikely to recover to the level needed to support the marketing
infrastructure.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which regulates the insurance
industry, was kept informed throughout but Mr Divers said the move to
close was not prompted by DTI action.

CEDRIC Brown, chief executive of British Gas has no feelings of guilt
over the 71% increase in his remuneration package last year to #492,602.
Speaking as the company announced a drop in first-quarter profits he
expressed confidence in shareholders support for his remuneration
package.
A resolution to be put to the company's shareholders at the AGM in
London's Docklands at the end of the month calls for a change in the
company's controversial pay structure for senior executives.
The Labour Party has lobbied major institutional shareholders such as
the Prudential and Standard Life to vote for the resolution. Mr Brown
believes that when they hear the company's explanations of the package
and what the job entails then ''I think they will see I am being paid
properly and correctly,'' he said.
Profits in the first three months of the year were depressed by a mild
winter. Growing competition led to a loss of market share, to below 40%,
in the large industrial and commercial customer segment. The company
faces a loss of market share in the important domestic market when its
monopoly supply position is ended at the beginning of next year as a
result of the Gas Bill currently going through Parliament.
Historic cost net profits slipped to #605m from #651m, broadly in line
with City expectations. The mild weather which reduces domestic demand
for heating clipped #28m off trading profits. Year-on-year comparisons
were distorted by the sale of the Consumers Gas company in Canada last
year.
On a divisional basis, results from Transco in the first quarter
showed operating profit of #450m compared with #480m previously. The
results of the Trading division showed a drop in operating profits to
#175m from #220m.
However, this was offset by a strong performance from Exploration and
Production which reported 67% higher profits of #212m. Business in this
division was boosted by the start of production from its North Morecambe
field and increased output at its South Morecambe operations.
''This division is also beginning to enjoy the benefit of a rigorous
cost reduction programme aimed at improving its efficiency,'' the
company said.
British Gas continues to develop its overseas business to provide an
unregulated income stream. The merger between NGC and Trident was
completed in March which gives British Gas a 34% shareholding in NGC,
one of the leading energy companies in the USA.
The company has expanded its interests in northern Russia. The first
gas arrived on shore this month from a Tunisian field.
''These are a fair set of figures but nothing to get excited about,''
said one analyst. Profits for the full year should benefit from
continuing cost-cutting. The company plans to make a further 10,000 job
cuts this year which should help to cut costs by #150m. There have
already been 2400 voluntary redundancies this year, ahead of the
company's expectations. British Gas embarked on major changes about two
years ago which included cutting 25,000 jobs by December 1998, most of
them by the end of 1996.
It has shed a total of 12,000 jobs. The company expects to eventually
recoup more than #600m in annual savings from the programme, a figure
that should be achievable by next year. A sharp drop in the number of
employees has been a key feature of all the privatised utilities as they
strive to maximise profits.
British Gas shares were a penny lighter at 303[1/2]p but are expected
to recover once they reach the lower end of trading ranges and interest
revives not least because they are supported by a 6% yield.

<TEXT>
DEVRO International, the Scottish sausage skin-maker, said yesterday
that British and US authorities would probably approve a proposed
takeover of its much larger US competitor Teepak International during
the summer.
But Devro warned that a slow start to the year in Continental Europe
would keep its interim results flat, little changed from last year's
level.
The Moodiesburn-based firm, which manufactures casings for meat and
dairy products, announced in March that it had reached an agreement in
principle to buy Teepak for $135m, taking on net debts up to a limit of
$155m.
The main obstacle to completion of the deal is approval by the US
Federal Trade Commission, but Devro chief executive Graeme Alexander
said this was expected within three or four months.
''I would be surprised if it came before June, but I would be
disappointed if it came after September,'' he told The Herald on the
sidelines of Devro's annual general meeting in Glasgow.
Mr Alexander said the UK Office of Fair Trading must also give its
green light for the takeover, but no hitches were expected on that front
either.
The chief executive said slow sales in Continental Europe were
expected to keep Devro's results for the six months to June in line with
their 1994 level. The company made a pre-tax profit of #14.1m on
turnover of #47.5m during the first half of last year.
''There is definitely a downturn in Germany and Central Europe,'' Mr
Alexander said.
But business in the UK, the United States and Australia was doing
better and a decline in Japanese sales had been reversed, he added.
''We are expecting the interim result to be broadly in line with last
year. It could be a little more or a little less,'' he said.
Devro chairman Leon Allen told the AGM that Devro's planned purchase
of Teepak would give the Scottish firm a wider product range and
additional production capacity and would give both firms better access
to world markets.
Devro could take advantage of Teepak's stronger position in the United
States, while Teepak could benefit from Devro's bigger presence in
Europe and the Far East, he said.
Teepak is twice the size of Devro, which was created by a management
buyout from Johnson and Johnson in 1991 and was floated on the stock
exchange in 1993.
But the US firm, which also has factories in Belgium, the Netherlands
and the Czech Republic, suffers from declining profits.
Devro, with sales of #98m last year, regards the US firm with 1994
sales of #205m, as an overweight giant, that must be restored to full
fitness.
For the last three years Teepak has suffered from flat sales,
declining profits and rising debt, although heavy investment has greatly
increased its production capacity.
Mr Alexander said Devro planned to integrate Teepak fully into a
single management structure.
The Scottish firm plans to finance the purchase of Teepak with about
#20m of its own cash, a #28m share sale to institutional investors and
about #80m of bank credit, he said.
The bank loans would be raised by First Chicago Bank with strong
support from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale, he added.
The chief executive said Devro might well make further acquisitions in
the future, but it would take about two or three years to digest Teepak.
''We have maybe bitten off as much as we can swallow right at this
moment,'' he said.
Devro shares dipped 9p to 234p.

THE Westland Apache attack helicopter is likely to be worth about
#9000m at its peak to UK industry, GKN chairman Sir David Lees told
shareholders yesterday.
At the moment Westland, bought last year by GKN, is engaged in a
bitter fight to win an order for the Apache from the Ministry of
Defence.
''This order, which initially could be worth around #2000m, would
bring with it very substantial opportunities for additional work, much
of which is in leading edge technologies, for over 150 UK companies.
''Over time, we believe the total UK industrial participation in the
Westland Apache programme could amount to some #9000m.''
Addressing the annual meeting, Sir David said the group was delighted
with the Westland acquisition. Its trading results for the first four
months of 1995 were well ahead of the comparative figures for last year
and its longer-term prospects were encouraging.
In other core areas, GKN has enjoyed strong trading in its car and
agritechnical parts businesses in the early months of the year. ''The
level of activity in almost all our plants around the world is high and
in a number of cases very high. Looking forward we do not expect this to
change much in the short term.''
GKN, based at Redditch in Worcestershire, is confident of boosting
sales in its key North American market this year despite independent
forecasts that demand for cars and light trucks will fall off slightly.
''In Europe as a whole, we are still expecting car production in 1995
to exceed last year's figures by a small percentage and the commercial
vehicle and agritechnical markets continue to strengthen.''

<RECORDNO>978321584</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the civil engineering, property and shipping group,
has sunk into losses of #48.2m for the six months ended March.
It is again not paying an interim dividend after a loss per share of
6.67p against earnings of 0.46p.
Today's news comes in the wake of the disastrous Christmas cruise by
the QE2, flagship of Trafalgar's Cunard shipping line, which was spoilt
by refitting work.
In all the Cunard liner business suffered an operating loss, before
exceptional items, of #6.9 million as a result of lower than expected
occupancy levels on its ships.
Trafalgar House, which had made #13.8m profits at the same stage in
1994, has appointed a new chief executive at Cunard and made further
management changes to strengthen the sales and marketing side of the
business.
Cunard's chairman is leaving ''by mutual agreement'' just five months
after the disastrous Christmas voyage.
Trafalgar House said John Olsen was leaving its board and that of
Cunard ''to pursue other interests''.
He will be replaced on the Trafalgar House board and as chairman and
chief executive of Cunard by Peter Ward, chairman of Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars.
The group said the action launched against Cunard by a group of QE2
passengers ''is in progress and is being vigorously contested. We
continue to believe that the action has no merit.''
The group also suffered #7.5m exceptional costs to cover refit
problems on the QE2.
Its power engineering business made a half-year operating loss of
#18.8m. In response, redundancies were announced in March.
In addition, Trafalgar suffered costs of #12m as a result of a foiled
bid for Northern Electric.
A group of American shareholders in Northern yesterday increased the
pressure on the company to reopen takeover talks with Trafalgar House.
Newcastle-based Northern rejected the revised Trafalgar bid after the
original, recommended #11-a-share offer was withdrawn following the
fresh investigation into electricity prices launched by the industry
regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild.
Trafalgar subsequently proposed an alternative 950p bid, but that
offer lapsed because Northern's board refused to allow shareholders to
vote on it.

* TONIGHT is definitely the night for rock'n'rollers who have
gallantly served their full term before the mast. Fats Domino would have
headed the list if only he hadn't been felled by illness. But there is
still a bundle of stoic musical veterans to choose from.
John Mayall brings his latest group of Bluesbreakers to town at the
Garage at 7pm, 30-odd years after he first began to assemble his
blues-powered bands from the flower of young British musical talent. But
while Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Jack Bruce are long gone, the
venerable Mayall's mastery of the zappier end of the genre continues
unabated.
Castlemilk's noble and tireless musical toilers at C Sharp Music
Factory, located in Castlemilk Community Centre, Castlemilk Drive,
continue their three-day event with an 8pm show by boogie-merchants
Climax Blues Band. Support tonight is from local hero Billy Rivers.
Naturally, however, there are new contenders on tonight's Mayfest
musical menu. Supergrass is a hotly-tipped teenaged power trio which
will be bringing its meaty, guitar-driven riffs and its mutton-chop
side-whiskers to the Plaza at 7pm. .
Finally, a reminder of another postponement: NVA won't be creating
Stormy Waters tonight and tomorrow. It should go ahead on July 21 and
22.

COMPETITION and regulatory pressure are catching up with BT, whose
latest results show a fall in profits, though dividends still go up by
well above inflation.
Over the year to March, profits dipped 3% to #2662m and the fall
accelerated in the final quarter, when they were down nearly 9% at
#509m.
The result means a lower bonus for chairman Sir Iain Vallance. This
will fall from #185,000 to #115,000. But BT's remuneration committee,
composed, the group hastens to add, entirely of non-executive directors,
has reviewed salaries of executive directors and has given Sir Iain a
3.2% rise to #480,000. It last increased in July 1992.
Sir Iain's total remuneration goes down nearly 10% to #599,000. At a
briefing yesterday he would not elaborate on what the committee had
decided for other directors but said the annual report would include a
detailed break-down.
So for last year shareholders do better than the chairman as the final
dividend is raised by 6% to 10.65p for a total of 17.7p.
Two factors were mainly responsible for the profits downturn.
Redundancy costs were #303m higher at #820m because more higher earning
managers took redundancy under the group's voluntary scheme and more
employees took the terms in total than expected. Secondly price cuts
cost #800m in lost revenue.
The massive technology-driven job reduction programme has largely run
its course, and the group-wide redundancy programme will finish in a few
weeks time. There will continue to be further losses in specific areas
of operation, still on a voluntary basis.
Redundancy costs will be down to #400m-#500m this year, while the
benefits of the reduction in costs will come through. The impact of
price cuts will also be less pronounced, resulting in a revenue
sacrifice of about #400m. These lower negatives are just as well given
the pressures BT is under.
Market share is continuing to slip, with the greatest challenge coming
from cable television, which can offer phone services up to 20% cheaper.
Around 50,000 BT customers a month are signing up and the cable network
is growing.
However, BT professes not to be worried, claiming that the rate of
decline in its share was less than forecast. It is wooing some people
back and it did succeed in seeing off the competitive challenge from
Mercury. It claims also to be more interested in expanding the total
market rather than concerned about its total market share.
But the haemorrhage of customers highlights the importance of the
large-scale trials of interactive services planned for this year. How
far the regulator, Don Cruickshank, will allow BT to go in this
direction remains to be seen.
In company with other privatised industries BT is not pleased with the
regulatory regime. Sir Iain said that although BT's trading prospects
were ''sound'' they were susceptible to a ''hostile and unpredictable
regulatory environment'' in the UK.
The group is keen to escape the UK regulator by expanding overseas but
here too it is not going to have a free hand and Sir Iain also mentions
the ''uncertain shape'' of regulation outside the UK.
The effect of UK price reductions, mainly reflecting lower rates for
weekday morning calls, national calls made at the weekend and many
long-distance national calls, was partly offset by a 7% rise in inland
call volume. International call costs have come down by 7% on average,
while volume was up 5%.
Competition from cable caused a 1% fall in domestic connections in the
final quarter and was also reflected in an 15% increase in interconnect
sales, where rivals pay BT for the use of its lines to deliver calls.
Revenue from mobile phones, mainly BT's controlling interest in Cellnet,
jumped 43%.
BT's overseas strategy is coming along, centred on its joint venture
with MCI of the US, called Concerto. This is aimed at giving
multinationals private worldwide networks.
During the past year the group has forged links in Norway, Germany,
Italy, and Sweden and only France remains to complete its European
coverage. This places the group in a strong position to take advantage
of liberalisation of telecommunications in the European Union, subject
of course to the regulatory regime.
Partly as a result of the development of Concert, and also of the
Cellnet mobile network, capital spending last year rose 23% to #2671m
and is set to be even higher this year. Another area of spending is the
computers to provide bills by the second rather than the unit. Despite
this BT's gearing remains modest at 18%.
BT shares were initially ahead on the figures but came back to end at
exactly 400p, down 2[1/2]p on balance. Given the uncertainties they are
no more than a hold but there is a good chance of dividend increases
ahead of inflation for years to come, which should keep its army of
small shareholders happy.

<HEADLINE>Scratch card game blamed for a drop in April retail sales</HEADLINE>

THE National Lottery's Instants scratch card game, which began on
March 21, is thought to have hit retail sales, which fell by 0.2% in
April confounding City expectations of an increase of 0.5%.
The continued weakness of sales could strengthen the hand of Kenneth
Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in any disagreement with the
Bank of England over whether interest rates should rise on June 7.
Though lower than in March after seasonal adjustment the volume of
sales was 0.8% higher than in April. The March figures were revised down
from a drop of 0.1% to 0.3%, but the year-on-year gain was 1.6%.
The three-monthly comparisons are healthier. In the latest three
months sales were 0.3% higher than in the previous three and 1.6% better
than in the same three months of 1994.
The British Retail Consortium said that consumer confidence continued
to be at a low ebb and the housing market refused to budge.
''Consumers are reluctant to take on debt, and, faced with these
factors, the retail market continues to be highly competitive and
particularly difficult for small traders,'' said James May, the
consortium's director-general.
''The BRC was relieved that the Chancellor resisted recent pressure to
increase interest rates and the BRC hopes that he will avoid such action
as long as possible.''
Average weekly ticket sales from the Instants lottery game are running
at #44m, which is equal to 1.5% of retail sales.
From this needs to be deducted the prize money of 50%. James Capel's
Adam Cole said it was unlikely that all the Instants sales represented
substitution from low ticket retail sales.
''It is quite conceivable that the introduction of these cards reduced
the volumes of retail sales in April by around 0.5%.
Other non-food retailers, a residual category comprising mainly small
shops, were the weakest sector with sales falling by 0.8%
month-on-month. The only area of notable strength was clothing and
footweart where volumes grew by 0.5%.
The three-monthly figures, which provide a better guide to the
underlying trend, showed steady growth in sales at food retailers and
mixed retail businesses with volumes in both categories up 0.7% on the
previous three months. Food retailers posted a gain of 2.9% on the same
three months of 1994 and mixed retailers' sales were 2.3% higher.
Clothing and footwear sales rose by 1.5% from the previous three
months and were up by 3.6% from the same three months a year earlier.
Good weather boosted sales of spring fashions.
Household goods sales fell sharply -- down 1.1% between the latest two
three monthly periods. Sales were only 1.5% higher than in the same
three months of last year. Fresh weakness in the housing market has
coincided with a steady acceleration in prices, now 3.2% higher than a
year ago.
Sales by other non-food retailers fell by 0.4% in the latest three
months and were 3.1% below the level of the same three months a year
ago.
Adam Cole said: ''It seems likely that much of the recent weakness of
retail sales is down to consumers substituting into purchases of leisure
services generally and the National Lottery in particular.''
He thought that the ''sogginess'' of the data made a base rate rise in
early June slightly less likely.
''While the Bank's argument for a rate rise (the strength of
manufacturing and the fall in sterling) are undented by these figures,
the chances that the Chancellor will choose to ignore the Bank's advice
have clearly increased.''

JAMES GORDON, a pioneer of independent radio in Scotland, will step
down as chief executive of Scottish Radio Holdings and managing director
of its flagship station Radio Clyde next year after reaching the age of
60, writes ROBERT POWELL.
But Mr Gordon, who has built up Radio Clyde since its foundation in
1972, will retain a back-seat role as non-executive chairman of the
group.
He will succeed Ian Chapman, the former head of Collins the publisher,
who will retire early next year after turning 70.
Mr Gordon's present job will be split in the reorganisation.
Richard Findlay, the managing director of Radio Forth in Edinburgh,
will take over as group chief executive, while Alex Dickson, the
programme director at Radio Clyde, will replace Mr Gordon as managing
director of the Glasgow-based station.
Scottish Radio Holdings said in a statement accompanying its interim
results yesterday that these changes would take effect in May 1996.
The company announced a 25% rise in pre-tax profits to #2.5m for the
six months to March 31, on turnover up 15% to #8.5m.
It achieved these results because of a 50% increase in national
broadcast revenue booked through its group sales house in London. This
compensated for a 1% fall in revenue generated locally in Scotland.
Scottish Radio said running costs had been kept below inflation in all
areas except marketing.
It raised the interim dividend to 2.1p from 1.8p at the half-way point
last year, but this failed to enthuse investors on a generally depressed
day in the stock market. Scottish Radio shares fell 2p 256p.
The management shake-up at Scottish Radio follows the renewal of its
licences to run four radio stations in east and central Scotland for a
further eight years.
Besides Radio Forth and Radio Clyde, the group owns Radio Tay in
Dundee and Northsound in Aberdeen.

GUINNESS produced a mixed cocktail of news for shareholders yesterday,
saying its stout beer side was strong but the spirits business was
depressed.
''Trading for the first four months of the year has shown no
significant change to the pattern experienced in the second half of
1994,'' chairman Tony Greener told shareholders.
''Guinness stout continues to perform strongly. In spirits,
Continental Europe and Japan remain depressed and there are specific
difficulties in Mexico and Venezuela,'' he said at the annual meeting.
''In the UK, the 'feel good' factor remains elusive'', he warned,
though trading reamains ''very staisfactory'' in Latin America and
South-east Asia.
''Looking further ahead, I can but reaffirm my confidence in the
opportunities that present themselves for the group around the world.
''There are exciting long term opportunites, particularly in emerging
and developing markets for spirits,'' he said.
''The prospects for our unique Guinness stout product are improving
all the time as we continue to make rapid progress in North America and
Continential Europe, with other opportunities also available in other
parts of the world, particularly in Asia-Pacific'', Mr Greener added.

THE Scottish &amp; Newcastle purchase of Courage finally saw the light of
day yesterday with the Edinburgh company paying an initial #425m for the
assets of the Foster's Brewing Group subsidiary.
Subject to regulatory approval with the Office of Fair Trading --
probably the biggest hurdle -- S&amp;N will have achieved what should have
happened over two decades ago.
The geographic fit between the two companies is remarkable with no
serious overlap apart from Yorkshire while they both share the
philosophy of being free traders with the tie representing under 15% of
volume.
Only 15%-20% of S&amp;N profits are generated in Scotland and just 1.5
million of the nine-million-barrel annual beer capacity is brewed in
Edinburgh.
In addition to the cash sum, it is committed to topping up the Courage
pension fund by #48m but that is spread over 12 years so the annual
amounts involved are of little consequence.
Intriguingly, Foster's has added an equity kicker to the sum by being
paid the increase in value on 10 million S&amp;N shares over 537p in either
1999 or 2000 obviously judging that the S&amp;N share price will rise over
the next few years by a useful amount.
Last night they closed down 7p at 539p with the City generally happy
about the complex details of the deal which transforms S&amp;N into being
Britain's largest brewer and with a brand portfolio that will provide a
platform to take it into Europe under the Foster's banner.
The rights issue designed to raise a net #354m is in two parts on the
basis of one new share at 475p for every seven held.
The first instalment of 190p is payable by June 9 and is not dependent
upon the deal proceeding to completion. The second payment is 285p and
will be made only on completion which is expected before the end of
July.
Chief executive Brian Stewart said that there will be a minimal effect
on earnings per share in the first year, ignoring exceptional items such
as goodwill write-downs and be earnings positive thereafter.
Annual savings of at least #40m annually are expected from 1997
onwards,
For the year just over to April, 1995 pre-tax profits are estimated to
have risen 18% to not less than #262m and earnings of 36.2p. The
dividend total will rise at least 7% to 18.23p with a final of 12.05p --
the new shares will not be entitled to this payment.
Courage in the year to last June had operating profits before
exceptional items of #34m on turnover of #1334m based on assets of
#411m. So the cost economies promised from the acquisition are extremely
significant.
The crucial question is the extent to which S&amp;N can capitalise upon
the selling power of its brands.
The impact upon the balance sheet is to increase overall gearing only
marginally from 42% to 45% although interest cover in the short term
will fall from six times to about four times.

IT would be nice to have sardines for my tea -- sardines on toast.
It's a long time since I've had that. So I bought a tin of sardines at
the Co-op down the road. It came packaged in a box with a pretty wavy
blue design and pink fishy things on it.
When I took the tin out it looked white and naked. Something was
missing. There was no key. All my life, sardines have come with a key.
It's part of the natural order of things. The technology is simple. You
snap off the key from the side of the tin, attach it to the little
tongue of metal conveniently supplied, and turn. The key glides round
gathering a scroll as it peels off a narrow strip of metal all round the
tin. Then you lift the lid off.
Sometimes there's a tricky bit at the joint of the tin, and
occasionally the strip of metal breaks off half way, but mostly it's no
problem. Sardines are easy.
I studied the bare tin in my hand, but there was no obvious solution.
It was aesthetically pleasing to look at, shiny with gently rounded
corners, but it was clearly designed to keep the sardines in and me out.
I picked up the box it came in. ''Guidelines: Co-op Sardines in
Vegetable Oil are now packed in a new easy-to-open can, simply use your
usual can opener''.
Strictly, that should be two sentences. There should be a period after
the first can, and simply should start with a capital S, but I could
live with the punctuation. The puncturing was more to the point. Now I
knew what to do.
I took my usual tin opener (that's what I call it), in fact my only
tin opener, and applied it in the usual way. It slid nicely round the
first corner and stuck at the next. A coil of oil oozed out and coated
my fingers.
I applied it to the tin a little further on. Again it cut a smooth
path round the first bend until it came to the next, where it skited
off. I now had a tin open at two opposite corners with the section of
lid in between still firmly attached.
I prised up one of the corners so that I could see the neatly packed
slivers of fish glinting with a silvery lustre. In doing so, being
slightly agitated at this turn of events, and having my fingers slippery
with oil, I managed to nick my thumb on the cut edge. A small smear of
blood appeared. I swore.
At this impasse I took a radical measure. I levered up the two open
ends of the tin as far as they would go and worked a teaspoon underneath
to dislodge the fish and scoop it out.
I didn't bother with the toast. I didn't bother grilling the emergent
sardines. To tell the truth, I felt quite trembly after this small
trauma. But a salad with minced sardines is really quite tasty. Try it
sometime.
Next time I was shopping I mentioned this to the woman at the counter.
She said: ''Maybe you need a new tin opener''.
But that's not so. It opens other tins well enough. Beans, OK.
Tomatoes. Spaghetti hoops. Well, I don't know. What's the world coming
to?
Tonight I might have fish fingers.

Public attitudes to recycling are very positive, but the provision of
local authority schemes in Scotland, and the success they enjoy, varies
greatly from one area to another, discovers Jennifer Cunningham
THERE is no waste strategy in Scotland, partly because the Scottish
Office has decided it wants to wait until the Scottish Environmental
Protection Association is established in 1996. In the meantime, England
has evolved a system which is already five years ahead of us, with
#16.4m from the Department of Environment to set up schemes. ''In
Scotland, everybody is dashing off in their own direction with no
overall planning,'' said John Ferguson, chairman of the Recycling
Advisory Group Scotland.
The most frequent request to cleansing departments is to start regular
collections of household paper. We all want to save the earth, but most
of us do little more than the ritual chink of bottle in bank, unless you
live in Leith, Dundee, Kyle and Carrick or some other district which has
taken the practical approach to environmental targets.
Bottle banks are a handy measure of public attitudes to recycling:
people do take the trouble to put the correct colour in each bank and
there is a demand for more bottle banks.
The idea of setting all local authorities a target of a 20% recycling
rate was met with predictions of doom that, as more and more waste
materials were collected, prices would fall below economic levels. In
fact, the opposite has happened.
Three years ago, as many charities discovered, waste paper became
worthless to the point where you could not give it away. That was
specifically due to an edict in Germany that paper could no longer be
disposed of in landfill sites. There was an immediate overspill into the
European market, prices plummeted and some mills were even being paid to
take waste paper. Now newsprint can fetch #80 a tonne.
Households in Dundee -- recycling city -- have had a separate paper
collection since before the war, but as a result of the district
council's environmental policy, 31,000 households have a green bin on
wheels for all paper and card, except waxed or plasticised cartons. With
a participation rate of vetween 81% and 95%, they collect about 120
tonnes a week, which is sold to Davidson's of Aberdeen, who reprocess it
to produce packaging and plasterboard.
Despite the market being flooded with paper from Germany just after
they had invested in a new baler and expanded their plant, Dundee
District Council stuck to its guns and found that in less than six
months the price rose from #9 to #55 a tonne.
Last year, the council made #350,000 from waste paper -- enough to
cover the cost of collecting it without adding in the savings in the
cost of transporting it to new landfill sites, since its own is almost
full.
The council has instituted an environmental policy which has led the
way in recycling in Scotland. In addition to green bins for paper,
12,000 households in the city have brown wheeled bins for what the
council calls botanical waste -- all vegetable matter from both kitchen
and garden. From 8000 tonnes of garden refuse a year, they produce 3500
tonnes of compost under the supervision of a microbiologist from Abertay
University.
Garden centres cannot get enough of their Discovery Compost, and the
bottom line is looking extremely cheerful according to the city's
environmental services department. They are now planning to take
productive waste mangement a step further with a waste to energy
incineration plant in conjunction with Scottish Power, which would
produce energy along with a heat recovery scheme which could possibly be
used to heat greenhouses.
Edinburgh has several innovative pilot schemes. The latest runs during
the Festival of the Environment -- from now until May 28 -- when there
will be collection points for old telephone directories in libraries and
sports centres.
Last year, 1000 tenement households in Leith took part in a pilot
scheme to recycle paper, cans, glass and plastic. Gary Turner,
Edinburgh's recycling officer, wanted to test commitment in an area with
a low level of car ownership and of storage space in the house.
On the basis that the easier you make it for people the more they
participate, they gave households a green bag into which they put all
paper, cans, glass and plastics, and they were sorted by the district
council. The contamination rate was very low, and the participation rate
was 42% -- better than predicted for an inner-city area, but the costs
remain prohibitive because it more or less means collecting refuse twice
on two different days.
Glasgow has 50 ''bring sites'' mainly in car parks, but there are
plans to increase the number accesssible to Glasgow's non car owning
population. They all have bottles banks, 10 also have depositories for
paper and steel cans, and some also take aluminium cans, textiles, waxed
beverage cartons and household plastic containers. ''We want to be in
the position where everyone in Glasgow will have access to a recycling
centre,'' said recycling officer, Rolf Matthews.
John Ferguson, chairman of Recycling Advisory Group Scotland, voices
the belief of his members in calling for positive intervention from
government.
''The EC packaging directive gives responsibility to nation states to
guarantee an end user for waste products. In the UK it has not gone far
enough.'' As an example, he cites the Government's voluntary agreement
with the newspaper industry to increase the amount of recycled material
in their newsprint to 40% by the year 2000.
''It should have been mandatory, and should have been a minimum of
50%, preferably 60%, and that would have sent the right signal for
additional mill capacity, which should logically be in Scotland, at
Gartcosh, serving the needs of Scotland and the north of England.''
THE EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE
* Is packaging greener in the rest of Europe?
In Germany every kind of mineral water is sold in the same glass
bottle, with only the labels differentiating between brands, so the
empties can be returned to the nearest filler.
A major catering company based in Munich has abandoned disposable cups
for a strong polypropylene beaker which can be washed and re-used. The
Dutch chainstore Albert Heijn has been innovative in reducing
unnecessary packaging in their own label goods. Examples include
replacing the plastic trays inside boxes of chocolates with a simple
separator between the two levels, and dispensing with the paper bag
inside boxes of dry goods such as rice. Other continental examples
include refillable plastic bottles for milk, drinks and household
detergents, a returnable, refillable  paint pot system for professional
decorators, and refillable spray cans for both commercial and household
use.

ON the surface, this week's shake-up at the Scottish Office is all
about saving money and improving service delivery. That insistent
duopoly of aims virtually sums up the rubric of our times, does it not?
But, on a more subliminal level, the proposed new departmental
structure is saying something deeply significant about how the
collective Scottish Office mind currently views the impact of its
wide-ranging policies on real life.
Industry and education are to merge into a single department. Those,
like the Scottish CBI, who fret about the skills deficit among the
young, and the gulf between academia and industry in commercialising the
fruits of research, will warmly welcome that.
But the Industry Department is to shed its recently acquired
responsibility for Scotland's roads programme, together with
responsibility for urban regeneration, European structural funds, and
new towns. All these go into a super Local Government Department, which
is also to embrace the new single-tier councils, planning and housing.
One could nitpick. Why does tourism go into Education and Industry,
while responsibility for the Historic Scotland agency sits in the new
Local Government pantechnicon? Does that make sense at a time when Rob
Roy is set to maraude across the world's cinema screens, with Liam
Neeson with a ''Come to Scotland'' message pinned to his plaid?
Enough of nitpicking. I want to address a bigger issue, prompted, in
large part, by work done by David Webster, a senior official with
Glasgow City Housing. This week's Scottish Office decision to separate
urban regeneration from industrial policy into separate departments
flies in the face of Webster's central concern.
It is that Glasgow has been bleeding jobs in frighteningly large
numbers for the past 15 years -- 37,756 manufacturing jobs lost between
1981 and 1991 and only 2843 service jobs gained -- and that an urban
regeneration strategy which concentrates primarily on upgrading the
physical infrastructure and does not seek to influence the location of
jobs within the city, will fail to staunch that haemorrhage.
For the past year, in a series of personal papers, Webster has argued
trenchantly that the task of finding new work for the urban unemployed
cannot be divorced from efforts to improve the environments in which
they live.
Webster's approach is deeply at odds with official Scottish Office
thinking. Ministers have occasionally paid lip service to his plea for a
comprehensive approach to urban regeneration. For example, when New Life
for Urban Scotland was published in 1988, ushering in the four
partnership initiatives in disadvantaged estates in Glasgow, Paisley,
Dundee, and Edinburgh, the Scottish Secretary's foreword acknowledged
that ''these peripheral estates grew up lacking the local economic base
. . . needed to sustain them as viable communities.''
But that acknowledgement of one historical mistake has not prevented
officials from repeating it this time round. When the 1993 follow-up
document, Progress in Partnership, was published, it stated: ''The main
route to increased employment is to improve links to economic
development outwith the areas, and the creation of employment within the
areas is a secondary objective.''
Unsurprisingly, the initiatives in Castlemilk, Ferguslie Park,
Whitfield, and Wester Hailes have focused on improving the housing stock
and the rest of the built environment. As far as jobs are concerned, the
emphasis has been confined to the kind of training and counselling
designed to help people get on their bikes, Tebbit-style, and compete
for jobs, wherever these jobs happen to be located in the wider
travel-to-work area.
Such thinking is spawning more apocalyptic official visions. When the
Scottish Office Environment Department responded to the Strathclyde
stucture plan last year, officials pointed out that, while Glasgow's
population had declined by 11% between 1981 and 1990, Eastwood's had
grown by 13%. ''This'', they pointed out, ''seems to us to raise
important questions about the likely future level of population of the
city.''
Webster argues that public policy has contributed directly to the
city's relative decline. The creation of a string of new towns and
enterprise zones around Glasgow; the bypassing of the city as a favoured
location for inward investment; disproportionately favourable shares of
Government industrial assistance going elsewhere; failure to redevelop
inner-city brownfield industrial sites -- all these aspects of public
policy have contributed to inexorable urban decline.
His own statistical analysis of census returns challenges the central
assumption in that policy stance. Webster shows that, even in relatively
advantaged areas, by far the largest percentage of people seek to live
and work in their home area. That is as true of Eastwood and Bearsden as
it is of Castlemilk and Springburn. When people travel elsewhere to
work, Webster demonstrates, the share of jobs they take in other areas
falls away far more dramatically with distance than common sense would
suggest. Even after a few kilometres, the percentage shares of jobs
captured are typically in the 0%-2% range. For those taking Norman
Tebbit's advice, the job pickings are relatively thin.
Webster is convinced that the current Scottish Office orthodoxy on
urban renewal dates from the mid-1980s when an analysis of Gear, the
Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal programme, by Pieda and the University of
Glasgow, explicitly rejected the idea that such programmes could have
any significant impact on economic regeneration, although that had been
one of Gear's core aims. ''The high unemployment experienced by (Gear)
residents'', the Pieda report concluded, ''reflects their social and
economic characteristics (eg, low education and skill levels) rather
than a lack of local employment opportunities.''
That approach, Webster believes, has since become enshrined in
Scottish Office policy, although the claims which underpin it are -- on
his analysis -- at best unproven and, at worst, erroneous. This week's
Scottish Office restructuring suggests that, so far, all his warnings
are falling on deaf official ears. Worse, that orthodoxy is becoming
even more entrenched.

WHEN wee Denis Mooney of Scottish telly was a backroom boy in the
business he was ever persuasive. Since he became a frontman for the
Scottish Action programme he has developed an approach which would do
for that of one of Bertie Wooster's aunts: in short, one finds oneself
doing the most remarkable things. Like appearing in front of camera for
one of his programmes when one knows that Scottish would pay two Lees
Macaroon bars for an hour-long interview with Clara Bow in the nude.
Thus I found myself being filmed in Heraghty's Bar on the Soo-Side of
Glasgow.
Let me put you straight about this Heraghty's Bar. I have used this
establishment as my club, office, and psychiatrist's couch for many
years. I have filmed in it often. Indeed, if there is a pub in the whole
of the British islands which has been filmed more often in I shall be
surprised. Astonished even. The lights, camera, action is never far away
from this institution.
So just last Tuesday the Urban V was back before the cameras and so
was Heraghty's. It is for a very short little piece indeed for a show by
Denis. Titled The A to Z of Glasgow. He and his team had shot a similar
piece about Edinburgh the week before. Hardly a new idea really, I
should have thought. Godfrey Smith, the English columnist, once wrote a
splendid tome called The Englishman's Companion which had much the same
notion. You look to an item which sums up things and do it by the
alphabet. Therefore under ''B'' in Mooney's short film, it is Bevvy.
This item was shot in Heraghty's Bar. ''H'' was for Heraghty's. They
shot that in Heraghty's Bar. A little later came an item for ''J''. This
stood for Jack McLean, ie, me. What else? They shot that in Heraghty's
too. Cheap really. Incidentally they had ''V'' represented by Vinegar,
the stuff you spray on fish and chips. Denis filmed that round the
corner from Heraghty's.
You will just have to wait to see the short little film to get the
rest of the subjects contained in this alpabetti spaghetti of the mind
of Scottish Television. Monday night at 10pm will do. Some of it makes
you think that you are not right in the head but that is the way of
telly. I have a dream of getting Chris Evans, Jonathan Ross, and Noel
Edmonds altogether in the Cairngorms next winter but only wearing
plimsolls and cycle shorts.
Why stop there? That Anthea lassie on brekky TV could join them with
gusto. Nobody on Scot FM would even be permitted the cycle shorts.
Needless to say the mountain rescue squads will have been disbanded. A
worthy and fitting end to them all. Let us get back to the filming.
Nothing makes any sense in TV filming. I once did a film for Scottish,
the plot of which revolved around the idea that I had been warned off
the sauce and was going to rattle the last wee goldie before I clung on
to the wagon in the most difficult pub to reach in Britain, which is in
Knoydart. We spent four days shooting the film. Last wee goldie? The
entire shoot was so packed full of last wee goldies that STV took to
calling the entire boozy cruise: Moydart in Knoydart. I remember we had
to film across the road from the pub we had allegedly kicked off from:
yes, my little South Side club.
The camera boys couldn't get it even after God knows how many takes.
Every time we got the cue a bus or a lorry passed by, obscuring my bit
of business. Once three fire engines raced across in front of the
lenses. And lastly came the children of the nearby primary school,
whooping away like the Iroquoi nation, prancing in front of camera and
waving to their grannies. Eventually I myself, the mere performer, came
up with the solution. ''Hal, luvvie'', I said to the producer, ''Go
round the corner to the Classic Cafe and buy 10 quid's worth of Mars
Bars for them.''
We withheld the box of confectionery from the pests until we contrived
to finish the filming of that sequence which took all of 30 seconds, and
then distributed the goodies so the midget bleeders could go off to
work, rest, and play to their content. Incidentally I recollect that the
wee short film won a European award. Sod all to do with me, apart from
my ruse concerning Mars Bars.
But all that is as nothing to the curious idea that soundmen and
camera people have that ''just one more take'' is going to provide
perfection. What another take provides in fact is a living for the boys
and girls in the production team and a pain in the arse for performers
like me. But then wee Denis can be awful persuasive. I got a dram for my
trouble. Ach, and a bit of fun.

HMMM. The mountaineer, it says here, finds the last 3000ft of
Everest's north ridge slow going. ''At that altitude, and with no
artificial oxygen, climbing 10ft feels like the equivalent of 100ft on a
Scottish mountain. He or she will manage 10 steps, then have to stop and
rest.''
Isn't that the way everyone climbs mountains? For one who finds each
10ft of the Scottish mountains the equivalent of 100ft in the Himalayas,
it's my favoured technique. But I shouldn't be so modest; while the
heroic Alison Hargreaves was hauling herself to the top of the world I
was sitting in the bar of the Loch Torridon Hotel looking, with
stupendous self-satisfaction, at the summit of Beinn Alligin.
Been there, done that. Is it possible? Across the loch the mountain's
daylight elegance is masked by dusk. Beinn Jekyll is turning into Mount
Hyde; shadows fill the great quaigh of Coir' nan Laoigh and wipe out the
definition of ridges, shoulders, and Horns -- all the inviting stepping
stones to the top. Alligin retreats into its primeval rock. Its
monstrous silhouette, like some beast of pre-history, looks inviolable.
The rocks remain; or as Hugh MacDiarmid had it, there are many ruined
buildings in the world but no ruined stones. We know what he meant,
though the literal mind might point to the climatic erosion which, only
30 million years ago, carved the Torridon mountains out of sandstone
over 600 million years old.
It's not quite so many years since I last visited this ancient wedge
of Wester Ross but it's a long time, and I'm cheered by its defiance.
Despite all the interfering efforts of the Scottish Tourist Board,
Highland region, and the National Trust it has changed little. It
remains the quintessential corner of the West Highland seaboard, with
all the emotional contradictions of its glorious wilderness:
heartbreakingly, heartsoothingly empty, heartmeltingly beautiful in
sunshine, heartsinkingly grim in glaur.
To burst into tears or burst into applause -- these are the only
possible responses to a May twilight on Upper Loch Torridon. As already
mentioned I'm also bursting with pride, because despite the late
snowfields and fresh frosting on the famed triptych of Alligin,
Liathach, and Eighe I have outmanoeuvred the conditions and followed my
own yellow streak to breach Beinn Alligin at a weak spot; even if the
route devised is treated with contempt by all the guide books. In fact,
it isn't even treated as a route.
The pages of this newspaper are often filled with boisterous accounts
of ''airy scrambling'' on famous ridges but years ago, on the final
approach to Sgurr Alasdair in the Cuillins, I had one serious exposure
to ''exposure'' -- that innocent euphemism for the experience of walking
along the tops of precipices -- and lost my head for heights. These
days, it's the tourist route or nothing.
Beinn Alligin is my husband's idea. ''An exquisitely scuptured
mountain of great beauty,'' he says, reading from Irvine Butterfield's
The High Mountains Companion. ''. . . the least complex of the three
mountains,'' he says, reading from Hamish Brown's entry in the SMC's The
Munros. ''The name means the Jewel Mountain,'' he says, reading from W H
Murray's The West Highlands of Scotland.
I say, reading from my centre of gravity, ''Is there a tourist
route?'' But there is no designated tourist route up Beinn Alligin.
Either you traverse the Horns, with ''some exposed, but perfectly easy
scrambling'' (which was what they told me on Sgurr Alasdair) or you go
up the steep Coir' nan Laoigh; and I can see that the corrie is patched
with snowfields, possibly glaciated.
The imagination ferments: ''Mountain Madness -- Couple Helicoptered
off Alligan'' at best, ''Tragedy in Torridon'' at worst. The humiliation
of being called ''unfit'' or ''underequipped'' for the conditions. No
crampons, no ice axe, no survival bag.
The mountain, like Liathach, stays with us through dinner in the Loch
Torridon Hotel, which is the best possible base camp for armchair
climbers. I watch the corrie from the bar, the dining room, the drawing
room, the library, our bedroom, and even our loo. Washing my hands,
brushing my teeth, I scrutinise the gradient, the scree, the snowfields;
even if we pick our way between them, might there not be black ice?
''There must be another way up,'' I mutter. ''Let me have a look at that
little book.'' My husband has been raving about the good sense and
careful detail of a walker's guide to Torridon by a man called Peter
Barton, who lives in Shieldaig.
Mr Barton sounds like our kind of hillwalker; to him goes the credit
for nudging us in the direction of our very own tourist route.
I discover it not under ''Mountain Ascents'' but under ''Long and High
Level Walks.'' Like everyone else Peter Barton mentions Coir' Nan Laoigh
and the Horns as the conventional routes to the top but in his account
of a walk round Beinn Alligin he slips in this reference: ''As you
continue round the impressive cliffs of Sgurr Mhor you may be surprised
to find these giving way to grass slopes leading to the summit. These
offer an easy and almost direct route to the summit . . . 1400ft and
half a mile away . . . its ascent is not part of this walk; but if you
feel tempted . . .''
We feel tempted. The next day, after three hours of rough but
exhilarating circumvention, we decorously mount the ridge between
Alligin's two tops of Tom na Gruagaich and Sgurr Mhor from the
north-west. We have crossed waterfalls, lunched beside lochans, gazed
hypnotically across great glacial scoops at the intimidating crags of
Liathach, Beinn Dearg, and Baosbheinn. And we have been the only figures
on this landscape of blasted beauty.
There's another good reason for improvising our tourist route. We hit
the ridge at a grassy saddle, and the whole vertiginous bowl of the
Jewel Mountain falls away below us, opening up views across the Horns to
Letterewe and Fisherfield, and across the awesome precipices of Tom na
Gruagaich to Ben Damph Forest and Applecross. My breath shortens and my
knees weaken.
Suddenly the mountain is busy. As we climb the last stepladder stretch
to Sgurr Mhor men, women, and even a child converge from the recommended
routes. One gung-ho young chap stomps past irritably, anxious to reach
the top before us. We have met him at the start of our walk; he knows
nothing of our sneaky sidestepping round the mountain but seems to be
wondering how two such obvious softies have managed to overtake him.
The race, my friend, isn't always to the strong.

THERE is nothing quite like a spot of lasciviousness in the name of
art.
The Blue Moon cafe in Edinburgh is offering an exhibition of
photographs by one Della Grace.
It is imaginatively entitled Hermaphrodykey and is a collection which
''goes beyond the boundaries of butch/femme, male/female and aims to
stir the desires, regardless of gender and sexual positioning''. Della
describes her work as representing ''a subculture of sexual deviants,
lascivious lesbians and gender-bending perverts''.
Della learnt to take snaps at the San Francisco Art Institute
simultaneously ''discovering leather sex and the joys of driving a motor
cycle cross country on mescaline. From here she found a way to make her
life and art synonymous.''
A few obvious questions spring to mind:
* Why do you never see these kind of jobs advertised?
* What exactly does she mean by sexual positioning?
* What kind of motorbike runs on mescaline and is it not awfy
expensive by the gallon?
* This Blue Moon place. Is it anything to do with relative sexual
positioning on a frequency scale?
Making waves
WE do not often turn our attention to a periodical called Utility
Week, the weekly magazine for utilities management. But we make an
exception to quote one of their reports which qualifies for the Diary's
Nation Once Again Department.
Under the heading ''English firms chase Scottish water deals'', we
read: ''The new Scottish water structure opens up exciting contract
prospects for cross-utility consortia which are not possible in
Britain.'' So, it's official. We can burn those Union flags.
Sad day
TO our Haud Me Back events section we feel we must add the fun day at
Kildare Park in Lanark which is being hosted by local funeral directors
Dorricott and Bent in aid of funds for Lanimer Day.
Shotgun wedding
WE try, honest, to avoid in this column material which is not just so.
But we do get tempted as in the case of an announcement which appeared
in the engagement column of the Oban Times, that bulwark of the West
Highland establishment. It reads: ''Small-Ritchie. Both families are
devastated to announce the engagement between M'Titza Small and M'Bosa
Ritchie, both of 6 Woodlea, Barbreck, by Lochgilphead.'' We could, of
course be totally wrong in the conclusions to which we have jumped and
there may be a couple of Afro-Scottish origin who have settled happily
in deepest Argyll.
Night school
WE are sorry but the innuendo continues. We are in receipt of a
leaflet detailing a ''marriage preparation'' course at Carberry Tower, a
college over Musselburgh way. It is entitled An Overnight Course for
Engaged Couples.
The name game
THE bad taste continues with a lawyer who had the task of defending a
chap accused of indecent exposure in Hove. A Mr Arscott.
For the record
LET us go upmarket and talk about Yes, the nice new restaurant which
Ferrier Richardson has opened in West Nile Street, Glasgow.
Ferrier, being a cultured type, has formalised that delightful
southern European business of soaking some nice bread in olive oil and
eating it while you wait for the starters to arrive.
The Diary, being far-travelled and un poco pretencioso, has always
done this but it usually involves spilling the olive oil all over the
table.
At Ferrier's new place, all the kit is in place. A bottle of the extra
virgin olive oil complete with pourer. A selection of delicious rolls
with various fillings including sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and parmesan
cheese -- some of which, lucky-bag style, you do not know the flavour of
until you break it open.
And last, but not least, a small white dish in which to pour the oil.
There has been one slight problem with the usage of Ferrier's
inventive dunking kit. Your average diner uses the oil dish as an
ashtray. The record, so far, for the number of ash-filled oil
receptacles removed by patient staff is six. Held by my dear colleague,
political editor Geoffrey Parkhouse.
No picnic
NEXT month sees the beginning of Wildlife Week 1995 during which
parents and children alike will be invited to participate in such events
as bat barbecues and spider workshops.
The reality is that you don't get to grill those horrible flappy
winged wee creatures nor get to listen to really interesting seminars by
clever arachnids.
The week, organised by an outfit called Wildlife Watch, consists of
various social functions where picnics are allied to wee jaunts where
kids can dip into nature.
All very well, we say, but is it not a sad day when children have to
be programmed to forage into the wildlife which surrounds them?
Whatever happened to fishing for bagaminnies? Whatever happened to
howking about the privet hedge for the pupae and larvae which, after
careful storage, would emerge as beautiful winged creatures?
Whatever happened to hunkering down in the grass and watching a
ladybird take flight without it all being part of a workshop?
Can we please have our countryside and our childhood back? Now.
Near misses
WE still cannot profess ourselves entirely satisfied with our dear
readers' attempts to find a suitably irreverent acronym for British
Airways. We can report two minor prize-winning air misses. Robert Brown
of Pollokshields, Glasgow, offers Bloody Rat-arsed Immediately Takeoff
Is Sounded having Already Imbibed Recklessly Within Airport's Yuppy
Saloon.
Colin H Kerr pessimistically pens Before Riding In The Ideal Sky Hotel

I WAS very interested in the Open Forum article by Gerry McSherry, but
much more so by the comments of the Rev Kenneth Macaulay (May 12).
I was baptised into the Church of Scotland, attended a school
dominated by that institution and in due course was ordained an elder.
In all that time I never felt any sense of belonging to ''The Church''
and never experienced any uplift whatsoever. Sunday attendance was a
chore and I looked at my watch more often than I looked at the minister.
Three years ago, a friend took me to a service in the Scottish
Episcopal Church, and the difference was nothing short of miraculous.
The warmth of the welcome, the feeling of belonging, and the sense of
spiritual well-being and tranquillity were overwhelming. I have now been
confirmed and am a faithful and enthusiastic attender.
I can certainly recommend it, and all non-football fans like myself
will be pleased to know that the support of Partick Thistle is not
obligatory.

IN response to my recent article on the subject of the anachronistic
1918 Education Act (May 9), Veronica Fox (May 15) quite rightly pleads
for ''a reasoned and well-informed debate on the Act''.
However, she then proceeds to launch the most unreasoned and
ill-informed onslaught against both myself and the article. She cannot
have it both ways.
In truth, her ''contribution'' to the debate on the Act amounts to
nothing more than a vain attempt to ingratiate herself even further with
the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Scotland (those who have no children).
Further, her letter does indeed strongly reek of the Roman Catholic
parent's ''highly irrational fear'' of those who have no children of
which I spoke in the article. Why else the cheap sycophancy?
As one who has found true Christianity by summarily rejecting the
pseudo-religious psychobabble, practised, perfected, and preached by the
organisation that is Roman Catholicism (and remember, Christianity is
never to be confused with Roman Catholicism) can I, as a true Christian,
extend my heartfelt sympathies to all Roman Catholic parents, including
the unfortunate Veronica Fox?
After all, it is not their fault that they were shanghaied into Roman
Catholicism at a very early age indeed. Like them, I too suffered, but
now that those who have no children no longer possess any physical,
psychological, emotional, or spiritual hold over myself that suffering
is at an end. Christ knows that's true.

IT was interesting to note Mr Alex Salmond's concern for the
discrimination against Roman Catholics in monarchal and British state
affairs (April 29).
Mr Salmond's declared aim is for a separate Scotland. This implies he
has no love for the Union or the monarchy.
It is, therefore, difficult to understand his desire to involve a
selected part of the community in institutions which he, himself, would
wish to eschew.

NICOLA REEVES argues that the principle of Compulsory Competitive
Tendering must be right because local authorities are monopoly providers
of council services (May 11). She is mistaken.
The problem is that the Government's legislation has had nothing do
with with improving services or council efficiency. CCT has meant a
decline in standards in many areas, particularly where contracts have
been awarded to the private sector.
The Government's aim has been to force councils to award contracts on
the basis of lowest cost -- quality of service has never entered the
equation.d
Her comments on the Equal Opportunities Commission report about the
effects of CCT also fail to mention the waste of public money involved.
The EOC concludes that compulsory tendering has produced savings of
around #124m a year. However, the overall cost of CCT amounts to #250m a
year thrugh higher social security spending and reduced income from
taxes and national insurance.
Nicola Reeves is right to condemn the effect CCT has had on women
workers and on equal opportunities. But she should also have condemned
the whole nasty business which has undermined quality of service at the
public's expense. The underlying aim of CCT has been to reduce workers'
pay and conditions of service and, whilst the EOC rightly highlights the
disproportionate effect on women, the policy itself deserves to be
consigned to the scrapheap.

DICK LOUDEN wrote of the iniquity of expecting the universities to
cater for increased student numbers while faced with cuts in funding,
called ''efficiency savings'', year after year (May 9).
At least no university is reported as experiencing a reduction in
actual funding. The situation is very different for further education
colleges where the progress towards application of the funding formula
has led to a situation described by one member of staff at the Scottish
Office Education Department as ''one of winners and losers''.
The reality of that statement has already been reported in the need
for Falkirk College to reduce its staff by the equivalent of 35
lecturers in the coming year and the Scottish Further and Higher
Education Association has information that suggests that several Glasgow
colleges will require to reduce staffing. Compulsory redundancies cannot
be ruled out.
Things will not get better in future years as the Government intends
that the global sum allocated to FE is to be cut each year in the
foreseeable future.
Two years ago the status of colleges was changed; they became
''incorporated''. At the time it was said that this was to free them
from the shackles of local authority control. Now we know the real
reason.
Local authorities would have resisted such funding cuts with the
ultimate weapon of maintaining the service by transferring the cost to
the ratepayers and making sure that the ratepayers, who are also voters,
knew where the blame really lay.
The colleges were transferred to allow cuts in funding to pay for the
''tax cuts'' that the Conservatives use to buy votes.
It must now be clear to everyone that tax cuts always result in a
reduction of standards of the service that we expect and deserve from
the state.

MR Malcolm Rifkind is reported to have said that the vast majority of
Scots would like a Scottish parliament or assembly, but want to remain
part of the United Kingdom.
He had no difficulty with the principle but reconciling these
aspirations is difficult -- presumably because of the West Lothian
factor where Scots can vote on English matters but English MPs could not
vote on Scottish affairs.
Yet this Government will give Northern Ireland an assembly. Irish MPs
will still be able to vote on English matters but the English will not
vote on Ulster affairs.
So Mr Rifkind, who is recognised as a distinguished lawyer, finds the
West Lothian factor insuperable, yet his Government can solve the West
Belfast factor.
That logic is absolutely fabulous.

DOES anyone in Scotland, England, Ireland, and Wales understand what

principle of devolution or of constitutional change if there were

One thing, however, is clear: Mr Rifkind is not going to commit

Should he be unlucky enough to scald himself by spilling his tea, then

properly rested doctors and well paid nurses, supported by cleaners,
porters, and other staff whose wages could not drop below the minimum as

Should Mr Major be severely injured, then I would hope that he would
avoid destitution by qualifying for the new Incapacity Benefit.
I would then like to escort him to a publicly-owned railway station

BY attempting to destroy one myth in Scottish history, Duncan Bryson
yet again perpetuates another, namely that Robert the Bruce was French
(May 5).
The reality of the situation is that, prior to Bruce's birth at
Turnberry in 1274, his family had been established in Scotland for five
generations.
His mother, Marjorie, was the daughter of Niall, Earl of Carrick, and
had a distinctly Celtic background.
There is little or no evidence that families with Norman origins, such
as Bruce's, saw themselves, or were generally regarded, as different
from the other noble families of Scotland during the period in question.
While he may have spoken French, Robert the Bruce was no more French
than the majority of peoples of South America are Spanish (or Portuguese
in the case of Brazil).

ALEX FLEMING is right that the Normans were originally Scandinavians
(largely Danish) invaders and settlers, but by the eleventh century had
adopted Frankish culture and language (May 13).
The text beneath one of the scenes in the Bayeux Tapestry reads:
''Where the English and the Franks fell in battle.''
I do not agree that Brus was a seventh-generation Scot. Certainly, his
family held lands in Annandale since 1124, but they also held lands in
Yorkshire. His father was a Constable of Carlisle Castle. His
grandfather served Henry III as a judge.His
great-great-great-grandfather appealed to David I before the Battle of
the Standard: ''Since when, my lord, I ask thee, hast thou found such
faith in Scots that thou dost with such confidence divest and deprive
thyself and thine of the council of the English, even the help of the
Normans, as if Scots would suffice alone for thee even against Scots?''

THE United Kingdom has been blessed by a remarkably open and honest
political culture which certainly bears comparison with any other.
Indeed, it would be hard to identify another which is demonstrably
superior, especially over any long period of time. That needs to be
said, and remembered, in case the contemporary preoccupation with sleaze
gets out of hand to the extent that we ignore the reality. The
revelations involved in the exposures of the past few years are worrying
because they are unusual, though those involving sexual relationships
may tell as much about the national fascination with this aspect of life
as the proclivities of politicians. The examples of financial corruption
and constitutional impropriety are another matter, but the Prime
Minister may have allowed himself to be stampeded into setting up the
Nolan Committee before considering whether the House of Commons did not
already possess itself the capacities and the will to tackle the clear
failings of some of its own Members. He wanted to ensure that not only
would the collective reputation of the House be enhanced, but that it
would be seen to be enhanced. He is now landed with the recommendations
of the committee but the House need not accept all of them. It must
maintain its own authority, even though the broad thrust of the Nolan
proposals is probably acceptable to the generality of MPs, as it is also
to the Government and the Opposition in their partisan modes.
Some MPs, for whom Sir Edward Heath, as the Father of the House, has
made himself the spokesman, are resentful of some Nolan recommendations.
In particular they are hostile to the proposal that MPs should be banned
from working for lobbying companies. The House should support them and
reject the proposal firmly, even though Labour, which has fewer Members
contracted to lobbyists (apart from trade union sponsors), will back the
prohibition. The idea that a Member of Parliament should have no contact
and direct financial involvement wih particular interests is hard to
sustain. What would be wrong is that such contacts -- and contracts --
should be concealed. There is nothing wrong with business, and other
interest groups from animal rights supporters to trade unions, seeking
to influence Government through particular parliamentary spokesmen.
There would be everything wrong with their trying to buy that influence.
In that connection the role of business and organised labour in funding
political parties demands addressing (as the Lib-Dems propose to do next
month in the House of Lords), but it has never been shown in the past
that such funding bought specific benefits, apart from honours. And the
only indisputable evidence of the buying of honours involved the
activities of Lloyd George.
Like any other random collection of over 600 people, MPs will contain
a wide spectrum of personalities, intelligences, and capacities. It
would be surprising if they did not contain some individuals unworthy of
the trust and honour their status confers. Perceptions of the collective
quality of the House vary, with some finding a decline in recent years
while others see a favourable comparison with the latter decades of the
past century. The membership tends to represent a cross-section of the
public-spirited membership of the community, with a decided bias to the
professional classes, notably the law and the communications industry
(using that term as shorthand for a wide body ranging from academics and
teachers to journalists). It is not well paid considering its importance
and the way in which the Government -- and any alternative Government --
is composed from its ranks. This relatively poor financial status
explains why many MPs seek to augment their salaries by outside work,
but the case for allowing them to go on doing so has even stronger
foundations. Parliament has always enjoyed the full-time professional
politician (at least since Walpole's day) but it has benefited mightily
also from the services of those whose contribution derived its weight
from their outside knowledge and interests. Such Members should continue
to flower as long as the public is aware of the financial arrangements
which irrigate their roots.

WITH a mighty leap -- and large rights issue -- Scottish and Newcastle
has become the largest brewer in Britain. By buying Courage from the
Australian company Fosters, the Scottish company has displaced Bass as
the country's top brewer, strengthening its position in the English
Midlands and marching everywhere south of the Thames. Few takeovers
confer such a neat geographical fit, and as this was widely heralded in
advance it may not evoke an automatic reference to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission though it leaves Scottish with a quarter of Britain's
beer sales. There may be some job losses but nothing specific is being
said yet, and they could turn out to be fairly modest though more likely
to be in the north at the Tadcaster and Halifax breweries than those at
Bristol and Reading. In fact for a business with such an enormous
turnover, Courage's labour force of fewer than 5000 workers hardly seems
excessive. Redundancies may be focused on the company's headquarters at
Staines where concern is already being expressed.
Doubts about the move will surface all the same. Beer sales are not
growing fast, though this move does enhance Scottish's exposure to some
''fancy'' foreign beers which enjoy considerable popular appeal, like
Foster's lagers themselves (where brewing rights for the UK, Ireland,
and Europe are being acquired) and the American Budweiser. Scottish did
not acquire Foster's large pub chain, but that would have invited the
attention of the Monopolies Commission for the Government has been
trying to loosen the links between producers of beer and the outlets to
consumers. Scottish already has its own clutch of pubs and, like
Whitbread, has moved firmly into the restaurant business as British
attitudes to drink have steadily broadened to include food. It also has
a large stake in wine sales, if much less than Whitbread's which owns
the successful Threshers chain.
The fact is that all the large brewers have diversified from the
traditional product as national habits have changed. We are moving away
from pubs towards home consumption of drinks. Even the undoubted
attractions of draught beer which formerly needed the pub are now in
great measure being met by cans (though connoisseurs are not easily
convinced). Pubs themselves have been greatly improved and in both
Scotland and the north of England Scottish has been a major proponent of
this trend. The drinks industry has become enormous and requires the
critical mass which this deal confers. Its need for size and economies
of scale coexists with a new awareness of the attractions of boutique
producers and sellers. These come and go out of fashion and in response
to financial pressures. The big companies have to have different
strategies for they need continuity and the financial strength necessary
to operate in world markets. That is the context in which this enormous
deal has been made. It could hardly have been envisaged when Foster took
over Courage less than a decade ago.

THE occasion was the Report Stage of this year's Finance Bill and the
subject was a proposed new tax on non-gaming machines in amusement
arcades. I had, very properly, been approached on the matter by
constituents who run arcades in Largs and Saltcoats. They pointed out to
me why the tax was not a good idea. In return, Lord Nolan, I was not
offered so much as a free ride on the dodgems.
Sir Jerry Wiggin rose to speak. ''I am,'' he declared, ''an adviser to
the British Holiday and Home Parks Association.'' He was followed by a
Tory MP for Hendon, Sir John Gorst -- these guys are all ''Sirs'' -- who
announced coyly: ''I am also an adviser to the industry.''
I was moved to comment that it sounded more like a consultants'
convention than a debate in the House of Commons. It was also a good
illustration of the extent to which ''consultancy'' has become endemic
to both the procedures of Parliament and the earnings of many MPs.
There is not the slightest doubt that the professionally sponsored
representations of these MP/consultants would have had more impact on
the outcome of this particular little issue than my humble pleadings as
a mere MP, representing constituency interests.
Therein lies a crucial, and unremarked upon, weakness of the system.
Tory Ministers -- perhaps with an eye to their own futures -- pander to
it. They give access to these MP/consultants, in the full knowledge that
they are acting as paid lobbyists for interests which may well have
nothing to do with their constituencies.
Millions of pounds hung on the outcome of that one tiny taxation
issue. Small wonder that the director-general of the British Holiday and
Home Parks Association should have been the only one yesterday with a
good word to say about Wiggins: ''We've found his work highly
satisfactory.'' Of that, I have no doubt.
The more complex the legislation, the greater the value of the
lobbyist's role. If they can get a highly technical amendment into the
hands of an MP, then they are off and running. They have opened up a
dialogue which will engage Ministers and civil servants. A skilfully run
lobbying campaign will often then result in changes to the proposed
legislation. Something like the Gas Bill is an absolute paradise for the
lobbyists. The financial implications are vast. The complexities are
immense. The language of the legislation is impenetrable. If, out of
this jungle, a successful amendment can emerge, couched in equally
obscure terms, then the likelihood is that nobody would notice except
the beneficiary!
The incredible act of stupidity on the part of Sir Jerry Wiggin was to
table such an amendment in the name of another MP, without consent. I
would have thought at, even then, it would have been prudent to choose
someone slightly less well-known than Sebastian Coe.
In his political existence, Mr Coe performs a fair impersonation of a
frightened rabbit. It is no surprise that he went into Olympic sprint
mode, to distance himself from the first whiff of scandal. If, instead,
Sir Jerry had squared it with a more battle-hardened veteran, the world
would be none the wiser.
It is utterly pointless to say that lobbyists shouldn't exist, or
suggest that MPs should not liaise with them where there are issues of
mutual interest. The crucial question is whether, in that process, the
MP has maintained his or her independence, or whether he has effectively
been hired by the lobbying interest.
That is the issue on which not even Lord Nolan has gone far enough. I
have never been able to see why the rule of the council chamber should
not also apply in the House of Commons. If an MP has a financial
interest to declare, he should also withdraw from the Chamber and
refrain from voting. If he fails to act in that way, he is guilty of a
criminal act. That would soon put an end to it.
It will be very interesting to see how the Tories respond to the key
recommendations (in this area at least) from the Nolan Committee --
''full disclosure of consultancy agreements and payments''; and a
''review (of) the merits of allowing MPs to hold consultancies.''
Nolan said that the issue of trade union sponsorship should also be
subject to the same examination, and he is absolutely right. Personally,
I am not sponsored and have no wish to be. But the reality which
separates union sponsorship from consultancy work is that no Labour MP
gains a personal penny from that relationship. That is the distinction
which an inquiry will bring out.
Over at Perth and Kinross, I fear that Mr Godfrey will have to wait
awhile for his consultancies. The only Tory posters which I have seen
tend to be very large ones, leering out from bales of hay or yellow
fields full of rape-seed subsidy. All this proves is that big, rich
farmers vote Tory which is not a terrific incentive to the rest of the
population.
I said at the outside the result of this by-election could become
interesting if the 54% of intending SNP voters who (according to System
Three) do not share the SNP's aim of an independent Scotland could feel
''liberated'' to vote Labour, without any risk of the Tories winning. It
is now clear that the precondition of the Tories not winning has been
fulfilled, and there is a lot of movement among the voters as a result.
I was never daft enough to say that Labour would win, but there are
certainly some interesting stirrings outside the Tory voting fields and
hay-stacks.

AS a Labour Party member of many years' standing, I write in reply to
the quite disgraceful article by that ex-communist politician Jimmy Reid
who once again reveals his real agenda, donning the clothes of the hard
left to attack the Labour Party in your paper in the article headed The
lost vision (May 13).
It's a bit hard to take coming from people such as Jimmy Reid who
never had a vision in the first place to cast aspersions on the Labour
Party which now has the overwhelming support of the people of this
country.
The old Glasgow saying that ''everyone is out of step bar my boy''
applies to Jimmy Reid in this case. Working people, young and old,
unemployed people, professional people, are voting in their thousands
for the Labour Party, but everybody is out of step bar Jimmy Reid! What
a load of unadulterated rubbish this is.
His reference to worshipping false gods is a bit hard to take coming
from a person whose political life intellectually embraced the worst
excesses of Stalinism and swallowed completely the garbage that emanated
from the Communist Party which claimed to be emancipating the people of
Eastern Europe, but what history has revealed is that it enslaved them
politically and culturally. So let's have less of the rubbish of a
person of that ilk attacking the Lablur Party.
Jimmy Reid is what he always was, a hard-left politician who knows
better than the mass of the people, who is opposed to democratic
socialism and who has revealed himself at this particular time as the
enemy of working men and women when he uses the press to attack the
Labour Party at the present moment when it is in ascendancy. It says a
lot for Jimmy's concern now that he is a journalist, remote from the
reality of working life, that he chooses this occasion and this
particular time to attack the Labour Party.
Well, I have news for him. His political views are those of a
political dinosaur, consigned to the dustbin of history.
The Labour Party will go on, the Labour Party will win the next
election, and the Labour Party will, as it always has, despite the
difficulties , make significant advances for the ordinary men and women
of this country.

READING The Herald (May 9), we found to our disbelief Hans Teske's
statement about his feelings because his family was removed from the
town of Stolp in 1945 and his father was murdered.
We combatants strongly protest about such a statement. It makes people
think that Poles murdered his father and are murderers. Does he remember
the year 1939 when Germans living in Poland on Hitler's and Goebbels's
order spied?
What about Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belsen, and other concentration camps
where six million Poles, millions of Jews, Hungarians, Czechs and other
nationalities were tortured, murdered by his own people, the SS and the
Gestapo?
We Polish combatants and Polish people are not anti-Germans. It is
time to forgive but not forget, and we hope that peace among the nations
will last for ever.

WELL. A night and a half at the movies -- not least in its duration --
in the swashbuckling company of Douglas Fairbanks Sen with Carl Davis
conducting the Royal SNO.
Last of a series of three classic silents, in some ways, The Thief of
Bagdad (1924) was the most stunning of the lot. High melodrama (with
corny titles), buccaneering adventure, and mind-boggling sets and
special effects combined to make a hugely entertaining experience. And
all backed by a very clever score, compiled, composed and conducted by
Carl Davis.
Decades -- nay, more like half a century before their time -- the
special effects of art director William Cameron Menzies stole the show,
lock, stock and barrel. Towering buildings: sleek, elegant and oriental,
suggested no expense spared in the sets.
In a welter of effects -- from flying carpet to winged horse, from
invisibility illusions to Fairbanks Sen sprinkling oofle dust and
creating an instant army -- the undersea scene, brilliantly composed
with Fairbanks in slow motion and his baggy pants billowing exactly as
they would underwater, capped the lot.
Fairbanks own performance -- nimble and lightfooted -- was balletic in
its choreography. No wonder he was dubbed the Nijinsky of the movies:
classical grace married to romantic panache.
Panache galore too from the Royal SNO playing Carl Davis's score,
largely a masterly deconstruction of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade,
with every motif, every rhythm, and every colour of the Russian
masterpiece, subjected to either literal application or infinite
extension. Equally, the best cuts of the same composer's Golden Cockerel
were called into magical service. First-rate series. More please.

ENTERING on Wednesday night with an electric guitar hanging round his
scrawny neck, the floppily-coiffed Dermot Carmody plainly resembled
Johnny Marr, former axe-hero with the Smiths. But then Johnny Marr never
quite looked as dissipated as Dermot managed to, and if you think about
it, Johnny Marr doesn't have Marty Feldman's attenuated eyeballs lolling
in his face like Dermot does, and here's another strange thing:
rubber-faced Hollywood movie-star Jim Carrey has surely never been as
hyper-active and cartoon-like in the visage department as Dermot,
either.
Similarly, Dermot's humour has many disparate strands. He does funny
musical pastiches, from a whining Bob Dylan via a crazed Patsy Cline to
a sex-hound Prince who is even more bizarre than the original. And he
does a neat job in up-ending Irish cultural stereotypes.
So what does Dermot's compatriot, Ardal, do? Hard to say. The star of
Channel 4's quietly-compulsive Father Ted just shuffles out with a
sleepy, slightly-stunned, hangdog look on his face, and he stands and
witters in an unravelling, punchline-free fashion.
Ardal tells you minutely-detailed things about the house he's just
bought, only he can't remember the details of where the house actually
is, so hasn't that been a waste of money? He speaks about the fickleness
of love; being employed as a Great Plains cow-scratcher; not having an
atrium; giving up God for Lent, and the strain imposed by keeping yawns
in.
No jokes and not a word of sense, but at the night's end, you've sore
cheeks from the continual smiley-chuckles Ardal O'Hanlon has had you
doing.

A new musical genre has emerged on the UK scene. David Belcher
discovers that Earthling music combines well-constructed songs with soul
and funk elements
WHAT'S in a name? Fashionable generic names like trip-hop and
trip-rap. Much-lauded names like Massive Attack and Tricky. Massive
Attack's long-awaited visit to Glasgow transpired to be a massive
disappointment, didn't it? Massive Atrophy.
And what did you make of that sullen, confrontational Tricky laddie
when he supported PJ Harvey? Muttering instead of rapping; mumbling
vague insults at us from the Barrowland stage, shuffling about like a
dooley . . . should we rename him Tripey or Dicky?
But here's a new name -- Earthling -- and a wholly-splendid new
musical genre: Earthling music. Earthling music has hypnotic hip-hop
elements, and eerie looped'n'sampled soul and funk elements, courtesy of
Earthling's musical director, Tim Saul. Earthling music has the wise,
witty and singular words of rapper Mau, who may turn out to be rap's
one-man answer to Bob Dylan, Salvador Dali, and Raymond Carver.
Additionally, Earthling music seduces your ears by deftly deploying the
skewed, honeyed, woozy soul-diva vocals of chanteuse Moni.
And above all, Earthling music features well-contructed songs, despite
the fact that songs have sadly gone out of fashion in recent years. And
Earthling's songs can be playful, frothy things which revel in their own
free-associating poetic nature. Or they can be songs which tell simple
everyday stories. Or they can be incisive narrative creations which
address stark social and political issues: child abuse, rape, drug
addiction, prostitution, and racial disharmony.
All these songs can be found on Earthling's debut album, Radar, which
will be released under on the Cooltempo label on Monday. Listen to it,
as for your own sake you must, and you will gain a new musical
perspective. Because Earthling reside in splendid isolation on the
planet Excellent, and their orbit round our humdrum globe is a
revelatory one.
Actually, Earthling's main duo of Tim Saul and Mau are from Bristol
and the London suburb of Ilford, respectively. Tim has hometown links
with Portishead's Geoff Barrow, but spurns all attempts by journos to
pigeonhole Earthling as part of some happening Bristol trip-hop scene
(man).
''If there has to be a term, British hip-hop is the one we like most.
It's the one we'd encourage journalists to use. Trip-hop . . . no-one
who makes that so-called music would agree that that is what they're
making. It's a term used by some London DJs trying to be friendly and
hip at the same time, in the same way that acid jazz came to be.''
Earthling has yet to be championed by any proprietorial DJs who see
themselves as style gurus at the head of their own nebulous,
trend-driven movement. Partly because Radar is an album for the heart,
mind and soul and not simply the feet. Partly because it blends so many
different musical styles, imagistic viewpoints, personal experiences,
and layers of meaning.
What does the album's title, Radar, mean, for instance? And the LP's
many catchy yet somewhat gnomic refrains -- elliptical slogans like Soup
or no soup -- what do they mean? And have I correctly divined a few
respectful name-checks for the immortal Captain Beefheart? Mau tells
all.
''We called the album Radar because it's a bland word for what we see
as a grand statement of our intentions . . . our music originates from
us two in London, but it spreads out much further. And lyrically and
musically we take from anywhere and everywhere, so we see ourselves as
having an openness . . . the album is about having your antennae
extended to everything. And radar is a whatsit . . . a word that reads
the same backwards as forwards -- a palindrome, which seemed apt, too.
''Soup or no soup is a saying I pinched off my great-grandmother, who
still lives in Ilford. If someone gives you an ultimatum, and you carry
on and do what you were going to do anyway . . . well, you're shrugging
your shoulders and saying: 'Soup or no soup, I'm sticking to my guns . .
. I have self-belief.' ''
Who are Earthling? Two exceptional blokes who met by chance three
years ago through the Musicians Wanted columns of a London free-sheet.
''We arranged to meet at my flat, which is at the top of a converted
church, the one that Reggie Kray got married in,'' says Tim.
Mau's initial awe of the locale turned into a mutual awe of each
other's talents. ''We put together I Could Just Die that afternoon,
using tracks I'd already built up and a rap Mau brought with him. We've
worked together every day since.''
Happy accident informs the creation of Earthling's instrumental
grooves, too. ''When I'm looking for samples, I'm looking for fresh
sounds which have certain characteristics and that no-one else has
sampled,'' says Tim.
''I've actually assembled a collection of totally crap records that
have brilliant sleeve photos. I've got a Millie album which isn't very
good musically, but the cover's great because Millie's sitting on a
giant banana which looks as though it's about to zoom off into outer
space.
''And I've used lots of sounds from an album I've never seen anywhere
else -- Spaced Out: Enoch Lite and His Orchestra Play Bacharach and Bach
-- which has a Barbarella-type figure flying through the stratosphere on
the cover.''

THE music of Michael Nyman tends to split the critical fraternity down
the middle. There are those for whom Nyman serves as the master
minimalist, capable of intoxicating them with his familiar blend of grit
and grace; and there are those for whom he serves as the ultimate in
uninspired boredom, penning tedious repetitions with not an end point in
sight.
Perhaps unusually, this critic prefers to sit on the fence, adjusting
her appreciation depending on the context.
While I can think of fewer recordings I would rather not listen to in
the comfort of my own home, at a concert venue, live and loud, this
music gets me really excited.
In a selection of excerpts from his award-winning film scores, Chasing
Sheep was copybook Nyman, raunch and rhythm over the simplest of
harmonic progressions. In the middle of Eye, as the momentum grew, it
struck me that an interesting comparison can be drawn between this and
rave music. The beat gets into your system and yes, it even makes you
want to dance. Carrington is the forthcoming Christopher Hampton film,
starring Emma Thompson and produced by Scottish-based Freeway Films.
In an unexpected departure from Peter Greenway territory, Nyman's
music remains disappointingly unchanged. Most memorable was an
interactive string episode (in which the Nyman Band was augmented by
eight Scottish players), evocative and wonderfully rhapsodic.
The Piano Suite has become a modern classic revered by a cult
following. They were not to be let down in last night's performance.
Meditative, hypnotic, and utterly passionate, few could have emerged
unmoved by the emotional impact of this, Nyman's richest film score.

SOMETIMES it is interesting to judge a performance by which personal
state you feel is best suited to its impact. Arc, the dance-installation
show, presented by the Scottish/Canadian company Icehouse, would
gravitate towards a hazy vision.
The set by Robbie Colman neatly fills the small theatre area in The
Tramway, a dark liquid pool, as black as oil, giving perfect reflections
of the three dancers, whose simple movements generate quiet ripples
across the surface. Above them an arc of material, like a jutting
iceberg, reaches towards the audience, carrying swathes of red or blue
lighting framing the action beneath. The piece is intentionally slow
asking the viewer to sit back and allow it to work its magic.
Unfortunately the magic is not delivered by the set of walks, abstract
gestures, and masked expressions which characterise its 50-minute
development.
As with much contemporary dance, it is a hit-or-miss exercise for an
untrained audience, as to whether they will be transported by the
dancers' language or left floundering. In Arc the quality of expression
does not transcend its self-imposed limitations. The ''journey through a
million possible futures which await us'' promised in the advertising
was released only occasionally in a beautifully held image, or the play
of light on well-defined musculature.
In attempting to avoid any definition of meaning within the landscape,
the audience were left pondering the movement of ripples and gentle
sound . . . definitely one for the glazed-eye brigade.
The company looks strong individually on paper, perhaps next time a
more powerful theme will emerge to release their respective talents.

JUST to get us in the mood, there's free popcorn -- and glimpses of
other sideshow attractions -- on the way in. We're not actually in the
tent -- we're outside, looking in. And that's where Robert Pacitti and
his fellow performers want us.
While they act the geeks, we will be the voyeurs. They will,
collectively and individually, dangle before us choice morsels of
apparent waywardness. Patriotism, for instance, takes on a rudely
intimate tack as the flag flies from quarters where the sun sure don't
shine . . . Gender will bend with lively flexibility. Sex will rear --
but when it turns nasty, it's because Nanny has the upper hand . . . And
baby was asking for it, just by being there, wasn't he?
Like the geeks of Coney Island, this foursome are the purveyors of
off-line experiences. They are looking to goose our preconceptions of
received values: what it means to be British, white, straight -- in
other words, privileged. The liberties taken with the flag are part of
an onslaught on what is labelled Lie Of The Land. Like the sexual games,
where a nubile Nanny pours out of her uniform even as she pours abuse on
her vulnerable charge, the focus of each section is really to alter the
filter of our viewpoint. You can either laugh, or be offended, but you
can't stay indifferent.
The show still has some rough patches. Inevitable when you are trying
to create a flux of risk-taking and astute pillory. What makes even the
opaque moments worth watching is the sheer class, and courage, of the
performers. Physical nakedness is not the hardest thing to offer an
audience. Exposing your rawest concerns, your own sexual identity, your
own vulnerability -- these are the real tests of integrity: the cast
pass with flying colours.

MICHAEL TUMELTY reports on a double-first for James MacMillan
THE latest work by leading Scottish composer James MacMillan tonight
receives a double world premiere in London that will be broadcast live
on Radio Three.
Hard on the heels of his choral masterpiece The Seven Last Words,
which last week received an award from the Royal Philharmonic Society,
MacMillan has produced another choral work, Mairi, written for the BBC
Singers.
The BBC's elite choral group -- Britain's only full time professional
chamber choir -- is celebrating its seventieth season with a stream of
commissions: every concert they perform in their birthday series
features a world premiere.
MacMillan's Mairi adapts the text of an eighteenth-century Gaelic
elegy by Evan McColl. Characteristically for MacMillan, the choir will
be divided into multiple parts and will draw on identifiable Scottish
sources -- on this occasion, ancient Celtic music. MacMillan will
introduce the music from the stage of St John's Smith Square in London.
As in each of the BBC Singers' seventieth birthday concerts, the new
work will receive two performances -- one in each half of the concert.
Bo Holten will conduct.

THEY might not have had the nous to throw a press conference but they
sure knew how to throw a party. Whatever the cavils aimed at Mayfest's
artistic programme, one of its biggest successes has undeniably been the
Mayfest Club. Mayfest artistic director Paul Bassett's decision to stage
the club in the city-centre location of the Fruit Market has been a
triumphant one which has packed in crowds night after night.
It certainly couldn't have been worse than last year's atmosphere-free
sojourn at the Becks Tent in Glasgow Green and, arguably, a late-night
club which provides outstandingly good value with three live bands for a
#2 cover charge and with hedonistic drinking hours unhindered by the
blight of the 12.30pm curfew which blankets the rest of the city's clubs
would be a big hit at any time of the year, but that is not to detract
from this year's Mayfest Club's winning formula.
Perhaps its greatest achievement has been in creating an atmospheric
forum for theatre-makers and theatre-goers and putting a sting back into
that much-lauded, much-lamented ''Mayfest buzz''. And while revellers
might get an illicit thrill out of stepping into a drinking den
post-curfew it should be noted that the suspension of the curfew is
singularly Mayfest-related -- the council's concession to the theatre
staff and technical crews who often have to work beyond midnight.
The club started with a bang, with a big bash on Thursday, April 28,
with the colourfully -- and expensively -- decorated Fruit Market
hosting an invited throng of the arts and media mafias. However, when
the same crowd had to stump up the readies for admission the following
evening the club died a dramatic death, with small groups looking rather
lost amid the Fruit Market's cavernous space and bands playing their
hearts out to a desolate dance floor.
Bassett and his staff should be congratulated for their immediate
response to this. They tweaked the formula, abandoned the no-pay area at
the bar, where drinkers were clustering rather than paying to see the
bands, advertised the opening weekend as a freebie loss-leader and
subsequently ironed out the #5 ticket price and #2 concession to a flat
rate of #2 for everyone, enforcing a strict no-more-freebies policy.
A frantic leafleting of local bars ensured the return of the crowds,
with Glasgow's beautiful people dancing the night away to the esoteric
musical line-ups.
Caroline Pierzchalo, the projects manager for the club, can take a pat
on the back for programming the eclectic musical mix combining
contrasting musical genre and up-and-coming talent with more established
names.
The audiences have been just as loyal as the bands and anyone who
hasn't sampled the delights of the Mayfest Club yet would do well to buy
a ticket in advance for the final appearance tonight and tomorrow --
with a crowd capacity of just 650 the events are sure to sell out. See
ya in the queue.

As a writer you get a physical sense of language, you know what it
feels like, you know what it tastes like.
Author A L Kennedy has reaped much success with her popular novels,
but as Stephen McGinty reports, they are also attracting a slightly mad
audience
WHEN A L Kennedy gives a public reading there is one thing you notice
and it is not the dark Armani suit, though it is a nice bundle of
threads. Nor is it the girls on the floor who watch with awe-tinged
admiration. It is impossible not to notice the slightly mad members of
the audience, like the little old lady in Edinburgh who crept around
asking for the author's personal details from the assistants at
Waterstone's.
But that is not it, though the author has noticed it too. ''I get a
few mad people at readings who stare at you very very intensely, and
other, sometimes intimidating, people who go to readings for the wrong
reasons. It's an attempt to take you back to their flat, I don't know,
maybe to be dinner rather than for dinner.''
At a recent reading in John Smith's bookshop in Glasgow's Byres Road a
lady in a red hat, combat jacket, and jeans sat at the front and fired
questions with the grace of exploding cannonballs.
''What's alchemy?
''Is it a religion like Buddhism?''
''Is Cyrano De Bergerac dead?''
''How can I get to him?''
Through a frozen grin and gritted teeth Kennedy hissed, read the book,
then talked on. It could have been worse. The previous night at the
Princes Street Waterstone's, one man wasn't even let in.
Yet while the novels and short stories of Alison Louise Kennedy can
often contain sex and violence, and a particularly vile combination of
razor blade and snoozing girl which combines both, it is the quiet
moments that catch the reader's breath.
And so with her readings. Despite the subject of the story and the
antics of the audience, eventually you notice that she has not stuttered
or stumbled or mispronounced or misplaced a single word. You'll find no
errs, umms, or ahs on the soundtrack. She reads just like she writes,
with a flow that often cannot be faulted.
Studying drama at Warwick University helped. ''It was all very
self-indulgent but it gave you a feel for words. Drama at university is
very good training if you want to be a writer, it's no good if you want
to act.
''As a writer you get a physical sense of language, you know what it
feels like, you know what it tastes like. I had signed up to do English
but I knew I didn't want to do that when I arrived.
''I know sod all about the language of criticism, alliteration,
metaphors, blah, blah, blah, which is great because that's not how my
mind works. I write so that it feels comfortable to read whether it's
being read out or not. If the music of it is OK then it works.''
When Jennifer M Wilson, the character in Kennedy's latest novel So I
Am Glad, reads out loud it too feels comfortable, for her voice is all
she has. Others write the words; as a radio announcer all she has to do
is speak them clearly, without stuttering, stumbling, mispronouncing or
misplacing a single word.
''Every 30 minutes, I was required to tell a fat black goosenecked
microphone about traffic irregularities, mutilated children, the
wreckage of peace in Europe and the weather. I felt the syllables warm
and open against my teeth, I licked and pushed and breathed them, kissed
them goodbye. It was almost moving, even with a crippled throat.''
When not sealed behind the sound-tight doors of the radio studio she
is impenetrable behind an emotional iron curtain. Her previous
relationship takes a lot of beating, being sado-masochistic, and it
takes time for her heart to warm when her flatmate announces that he is
Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac, French swordsman, poet, and playwright.
To research the real man behind the popular play by Edmond Rauissual
about the French captain with the big nose -- ''he didn't actually have
a giant nose, it was more the Roman nose to end all Roman noses'' -- who
writes love letters to the women he adores but for another man, Kennedy
travelled eight times to Paris and learned seventeenth-century French.
She wept when visiting Sannois where he died and became protective of
the bones of his father after finding out that they had been dumped in
the Paris catacombs. ''I paid it a visit and found these American
tourists posing to have pictures taken beside a heap of bones . . . I
wanted to say my buddy's dad's bones are in there -- show a little
respect for f**k's sake!''
Though Cyrano killed more men than Charles Manson he was an artist
with more than his sword. He wrote the first science-fiction novel with
his adventure Voyage dans la Lune and proved to be a powerful political
thinker whose modern opinions on the subject of the church and crown
could have resulted in his death. As it was, he died of natural causes.
''I think because I've done a lot of work in the community and with
people in confinement I can appreciate Cyrano. He was a wonderful writer
but a lot of it was about being able to fly, to escape. He doesn't feel
happy. At the time of his death he said he had a lot of regrets, he
wanted to be remembered as a playwright. But that was sabotaged . . . he
was accused of being an atheist at a time when you could be hanged for
it. In the end he is only remembered as a play.''
In So I Am Glad it takes a dead man to break Jennifer's barrier. While
her French visitor has retired from a lifetime of violence, Jennifer
continues to indulge pleasure with pain. In one harrowing scene she
badly beats her consenting lover. After a description of the distressing
scene she opens a new chapter with a cunning line. ''Well, I only told
you I was calm. I never suggested that I was nice.''
''All I knew with Jennifer was that she was only a voice. She didn't
have any feelings and in one chapter all her rage comes out. I wanted to
show that people who are very quiet and sealed up can also be very
dangerous because they can't understand what others feel.''
Jennifer does learn to feel and becomes more than a voice but it takes
loss and a duel. A L Kennedy learned to fence while writing the book.
''It's very much like writing. It's all psychology and you're trying to
touch somebody.''
* A L Kennedy's latest book So I Am Glad is reviewed in Weekender
tomorrow.

Andrew Wilson reports on a merger that makes sense
NOT even an advertising agency could have dreamt up a title such as
Scottish Courage and then charged a fee. The merging of the brewing
activities of Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Courage represents the
culmination of rumours which began as long ago as 1968 when there were
exploratory talks between the then two family-dominated companies where
the logic for a combination was as valid then as it is today.
The geographical fit is excellent and both are oriented more to the
free trade than any of their competitors apart from Guinness. But in the
following quarter century or so the two have managerially been
transformed out of all recognition.
There is a certain irony which is relished with quiet enjoyment at the
Abbey Brewery headquarters that S&amp;N has turned the tables on its
one-time enemy when Fosters was a subsidiary of Elders IXL, the
international vehicle for the highly ambitious John Elliott who finally
overreached himself.
The Australian planned to create a truly global brewing empire and
''Fosterise the Universe'' using S&amp;N as its British colony to expand
into Europe and seemed set for success.
However a white knight turned up in the form of the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission which blocked the #1600m bid, partly because of the
domination the Foster's lager brand would have had in the UK with its
becoming the house brand for both S&amp;N and Grand Metropolitan which in
those days still had a direct participation in brewing through its
control of Courage.
There was evident satisfaction when Elders finally sold its 23%
holding at a loss of #90m although Elliott then went on to do the highly
complicated swap of breweries for pubs with Grand Metropolitan.
S&amp;N traces its origins back to 1749 when the William Younger brewery
was established in Leith. Over a century later, in 1856 the William
McEwan brewery was founded in a period of great prosperity for the
brewing industry whose visible proof lies with the magnificent McEwan
Hall given to Edinburgh in perpetuity.
In the early 1930s, the two companies were merged to form the basic
rather unimaginatively named Scottish Brewers.
However there was the other strand developing with Gateshead seeing
the John Barras building his brewery just 21 years after Younger's in
1770 which in 1890 became part of Newcastle Breweries as the industry
began to move towards larger units as the advantages of improved
transport enabled economies of scale.
The two strands came together in 1960, partly for defensive reasons as
a highly aggressive Canadian beer baron named Taylor was causing fear
and trepidation in the industry through his takeover forays and forcing
the native brewers to come together. The most conspicuous example was
the formation of the Whitbread ''umbrella'' when Colonel Whitbread
persuaded many smaller brewers that it was in their interests for
Whitbread to buy large stakes in their shares.
In the 1960s, S&amp;N company did nothing much of note. However it moved
decisively into the free trade in the 1970s realising that Scotland and
the North-east of England was too small a trading area to provide
long-term growth.
It was one of the leaders in supplying the supermarkets which enabled
it to gain a market share in due course of over 10% -- now about 12%-13%
depending upon how one counts the French exports through Calais.
Expansion was helped through the building of a brewery in Manchester
and the acquisition of the Home Brewery in Nottingham -- that seems
exposed if there is to be a rationalisation of the brewery portfolio
once the Courage acquisition is completed.
A year later in 1987, it finally gained control of Blackburn-based
Matthew Brown after two attempts in a very hostile takeover battle.
Under chairman Sir Alick Rankin and his extremely able lieutenant
Brian Stewart, S&amp;N has developed a reputation as being a very effective
corporate operator.
The two deals which are still praised in the City were the sale of
Thistle Hotels for #645m in 1989 with the proceeds almost immediately
invested in Center Parcs, the 14 allweather leisure centres which have
taken northern Europe by storm and have held up consistently in profit
terms even through the bleakest days of the recession.
More recently there has been the purchase of the Chef &amp; Brewer chain
of pubs from Grand Metropolitan for #700m. These have performed ahead of
expectations and have given S&amp;N a substantial pub estate in the south of
England where it has historically been substantially under-represented.
In 1980, the company was valued by the stock market at #180m. Today it
is worth #2900m and has moved into being the largest brewer, overtaking
the longtime leader Bass by a margin of perhaps 6% with 25% of the
market compared with the Bass share of 19%.
But it is far from certain S&amp;N will hold this lead for more than
perhaps a year as some suspect that the unhappy Carlsberg-Tetley may be
sold by present owners Allied Domecq to Whitbread, the past master of
branding to establish the new industry giant.

The day of the floating drinker has arrived, reports Ken Smith, as the
battle between traditional and designer beers intensifies
IT'S a figure that would have the caricature Scots drunk of old
weeping into his beer -- by the end of the decade Scots pubs will sell
over 100 million less pints a year than they do today.
It's not quite a total victory for the Temperance Movement, as the
average Scot will by then be drinking more at home. But it is a
significant change. For more and more people, the pub is no longer the
centre of the universe.
Within these bald figures other changes are taking place. The loyalty
of drinking the same type of pint until you die is evaporating. People
are aware that younger drinkers are often turning to the premium brands,
the so-called designer drinks which come in expensive bottles.
Only they are changing yet again. Many are wakening up to the fact
that paying nearly #2 for a bottle containing less than half a pint is
not the bargain of the century, but they don't want to go back to fizzy
heavy. So now the smart money is on what the trade call mixed gas
dispensed ales such as Caffreys or Kilkenny. The pint is making a
comeback, albeit in a shrinking market.
It seems the day of the floating drinker has arrived. He may have a
pint of Tennent's lager after he finishes work. He may drink Caffrey's
when going out with the lads. He may drink a bottle of Beck's when at
the disco. Pints when playing pool, bottles when on the pull, as it
were.
Confusing? No wonder Scottish and Newcastle wants to protect itself in
a shrinking market by tying up with Courage. With the beer market
declining, and a 20% overcapacity in breweries in Britain, S&amp;N are
obviously taking the fact that you need courage to be a brewer these
days, literally.
Trade information suggests that about two million barrels a year in
Scotland are sold to the on-trade -- pubs, restaurants, and hotels.
Although it may actually be pumped in by tanker, it is still measured in
barrels, which is 288 pints. By the year 2000, it is estimated that this
will drop to 1.6 million barrels.
The growth area of off-sales will see an estimated increase from
930,000 barrels to 1,080,000 barrels. It's an increase of 150,000 which
the brewers will welcome, but will not offset the 400,000 decrease in
on-sales.
So why the change? Mark Hunter, marketing director at Tennent
Caledonian, says: ''There are enormous social changes. Visits to the pub
may be more fleeting, an hour say, as opposed to the whole evening.
Big-volume session drinking is on the wane.
''Other things may initially seem unrelated. But over 85% of Scots buy
lottery tickets which is far higher than the national average. If 25 to
35-year-old males, your core beer drinkers, are buying #2 to #5 worth of
lottery tickets a week, that's the price of a couple of pints.
''People are also doing different things. Multiplex cinemas have grown
to compete at entertainment. People are even going to shopping centres
more and drinking more at home.
''With six cans and a video you can have a reasonable good time at
home.''
Not that Tennent's are throwing in the towel themselves. Their lager
is still a monster. The biggest consumer brand of anything in Scotland.
A quarter of all beer sold in Scotland is Tennent's lager, and they work
very hard at keeping its stature within the market.
Within the standard lager market in pubs, Tennent's has 60% share to
McEwan's 19%, and the others down in small single figures.
The premium lager market, such as Budweiser, Beck's, and Miller
Genuine Draught, is now levelling out after years of steady growth. It
now has 8% of the beer market to standard lager's 44%. Bud, the American
beer now brewed in England, has been making inroads at the expense of
Beck's the quality German beer.
Standard ales, such as Tennent's and McEwan's Special, have 27% of the
market, but the sector has dropped by a quarter recently. Premium ales
are now flavour of the month, which includes beers like Caffreys and
Guinness. The market is growing, but nowhere near as fast to offset
entirely the drop in standard ales.
This will really make an old-fashioned beer drinker splutter. Bud is
actually growing in sales because it tastes so bland. Many younger
drinkers, it seems, want what is called a non-challenging taste. They
use drink as a social lubricant, but don't necessarily want to notice
what it tastes like.
The resurgence in cask beers is caused by those recognising foreign
bottled beers are not particularly good value, and want to go back to a
pint, but still want it to be a bit different from the standard fizzy
beer of old.
Pat Duffy, editor of the Scottish License Trade News, says that pubs
will still survive, but they have to work a lot harder at attracting
customers.
''I know of one pub in Kilmarnock which has 24 beers on draught in
order to satisfy the customers. Not so long ago a pub would have one
lager and one heavy and that was it.
''There has also been a shift to home drinking. People are just
entertaining at home more. Satellite TV is an attraction, and people are
actually spending more time with their kids than they used to do in the
old days.''
He believes that the Courage takeover may lead to the number of brands
being cut, and possibly even brewery closures or sell-offs. He suggests
that S&amp;N is also recognising the substantial growth in England of large
chains of pubs which are not owned by a brewery.
''A number of large regional brewers in England opted out of brewing
completely after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report aimed at
freeing up the market. Instead they kept their 600 or 1000 pubs and used
their strength to negotiate discounts from the Big Six brewers.
''With the Courage takeover, Scottish Courage, as it may become known
as, will have the spread of brands and economies of scale to deal with
these large chains.''
In Scotland though there are far more free trade outlets and single
owner pubs which may in fact only be selling three or four barrels a
week. They may be paying #250 to #270 a barrel while the big chains are
negotiating discounts of approaching half of that.
The brewers are attempting to cope with the downturn in sales by
selling a quality product, naturally at a quality price. While people
unemployed or strapped for cash are buying strange, unheard of, foreign
brands in the supermarkets, simply because they are cheap, in contrast
the beer cans with widgets in them to give a cask ale style of delivery
are selling at over a #1 a can. The market, it seems, is dividing into
the cheap and cheerful versus the quality brands, which will of course
cost more in the future. And no doubt that will have the caricature Scot
crying into his beer as well.

WORKERS at the 10 S&amp;N and Courage breweries supped their beer last
night uncertain on whether to celebrate the coming together of the two
concerns or to drown their sorrows.
On the one hand the much-heralded merger announcement ended a
prolonged period of uncertainty and should certainly mean both are now
safer from the attention of other predators. Yet history has shown that
takeovers of this scale inevitably lead to rationalisation in an
industry that has shed some 5000 jobs in the past three years alone.
There are also fears that the proposed takeover will spark other
restructuring within the volatile brewing trade which has seen a steady
flow of acquisitions and mergers with the number of breweries plummeting
from some 17,000 at the turn of the century to the latest situation
where, following the S&amp;N-Courage link-up, just four concerns will
control 84% of the industry.
At each step of the way jobs and often plants were phased out with the
result that today there are only about 25,000 employed in the brewing
and distribution sector.
The unions and the beer lovers' pressure group -- the Campaign for
Real Ale -- fear that the merger will further concentrate ownership,
reduce competition and lead to rationalisation throughout the Scottish &amp;
Newcastle and Courage operations. Camra even feels that the future of
several smaller breweries could be threatened.
Transport and General Workers Union national secretary Brian Revell
maintains that the news of the acquisition has at least brought an end
to a period of uncertainty which despite losing several thousand jobs in
recent years still has considerable overcapacity.
He believed his members would give the news a cautious welcome.
Clearly there was a danger of job losses through rationalistion in
administration, distribution and possibly even production through
combining the two groups. But if there had to be a further coming
together of the main players in the industry this was probably the most
acceptable as S&amp;N and Courage's operations complemented each other's in
a way that no other combination could. The two had a good ''North South
fit''.
Mr Revell blamed much of the industry's plight on the controversial
1989 Mergers and Monopolies Commission report on the supply of beer and
on the high level of taxation on it.
Supposed to open up greater competition in the industry which was then
dominated by six companies controlling 78% of the trade, the inquiry was
firmly opposed by the TGWU who pointed out it would be likely to have
the opposite effect.
Despite a certain amount of trading of pubs for breweries to
accommodate the MMC findings, which were endorsed by the then Industry
Secretary Lord Young, the concentration continued.
''Sadly we were proved right,'' comments Revell who bemoans that fact
that neither Lord Young nor any of the MMC inquiry team -- with the
honourable exception of bankworkers' union leader, TUC president and
beer aficionado Leif Mills who produced his own minority report -- knew
much about the brewing industry.
Mr Revell, who will be calling together shop stewards from S&amp;N and
Courage soon to assess the likely implications of the merger, accepts
there will be unpalatable aspects as the inevitable rationalisation gets
under way.

Stewart Lamont examines the key issues facing the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland when it opens tomorrow
BEHIND the venerable facade of the Kirk's General Assembly when it
meets in Edinburgh tomorrow will lie some far-reaching changes planned
for the national church. The most obvious is a cosmetic change in the
way the assembly itself is run. Gone are the days of all-male toilets,
and a sauna-style atmosphere in which men in black suits baked under TV
lights, passing resolutions about care for the disabled, none of whom
could reach the rocky heights of the assembly hall's staircases.
There are now female toilets, a coffee lounge, unobtrusive CCTV under
cool lights, a lift for the disabled -- and this year another
modernising change. In the ''playpen'' beneath the Moderator, from which
the procedures are conducted, a series of computer terminals will enable
the officials to communicate directly with the firm which prints the
daily minutes. Gone are the shorthand writers, the savings having bought
a machine which will log the proceedings in sound and vision on around
38 CDs.
This CD-ROM revolution has led to a little game of musical chairs in
the playpen itself. A specially made hexagonal table will group the
players. The principal clerk, James Weatherhead, will sit at the head
with his deputy and successor (Finlay Macdonald of Jordanhill) on his
right and on his left Alastair Dunlop QC, the advocate who successfully
persuaded the Court of Session last month that the Kirk was master in
its own house over hiring and firing ministers.
On his left the business managers (Tom ''Big Ears'' McWilliam and Mrs
Ann McCarter) sit opposite the new Kirk solicitor, Mrs J S Wilson, and
Mrs Alison Murray, Jordanhill Church secretary, who will be slipping her
discs into the computers.
In PR terms it will be a more modern and feminine image for the body
which recently used to address itself as ''Fathers and Brethern''. But
behind the facade other, more far-reaching changes will not be so easily
adopted. Tomorrow evening the Assembly Council will be inviting
endorsement of its plans to trim back on Kirk work in times of
stringency -- and will meet with opposition right away.
The Board of Communication is being told to cut one of its sections
(publishing, design and publicity, or audio-visual) and is fighting its
corner. It agrees that in the commercial world it could not keep these
departments, but wants the Kirk to subsidise them as essential in-house
activities.
This is the problem when you have a structure like the Kirk. There are
so many checks and balances that it is difficult to get agreement to
implement cuts when there are others who consider the work to be
essential. Another example of this will arise when the parish education
committee is challenged by the Kirk group who are running Carberry Tower
to sell it to them (the offer is rumoured to be #300,000 against market
valuations from #1.2m to #1.8m).
The plea is that they should at least be allowed a chance to carry on
valuable work which cannot have a market price put on it. The same kind
of protest will surface from historic churches in Stirling and Alloa who
are being asked to move to short-term contract ministries. But that is
the way the wind is blowing.
The Board of Ministry also wants to introduce contracts for ministers
which will for the first time, spell out duties and a code of conduct
for ministers which will make them more accountable for what they do. A
further extension of this process will come right at the start of the
Assembly when a group will be asked to examine the whole question of
whether ministers should have the right of tenure once they are inducted
to a parish.
This is a key issue. It sharpens and focuses the major issue facing
the Kirk today -- the question of where authority lies. In theory, it is
easy -- it lies with presbyteries (for that is what presbyterianism is).
But for reasons of practical administration it now in reality lies with
Assembly boards (composed of course of representative elders and
ministers from presbyteries).
However, ask the man in the pew and he thinks that authority lies with
his congregation to do as they wish. The mismatch between these areas of
authority creates problems of leadership and dissipates much energy in
solving its problems.
One thing is certain, there is a pressing need to settle the authority
question and press ahead with change. Putting off that decision or
carrying on as before is likely to deepen the malaise. One solution to
the authority question which has been anathema to Kirk worthies in the
past is a system of bishops. Yet that very system is a possible outcome
of one report which invites the Kirk to take up where it left off in
unity talks with the Scottish Episcopal Church.
It is unlikely that if they are unable to agree upon who runs their
show at present, the Church of Scotland will turn to their traditional
bogeyman to save them. The danger, as I see it, is that anachronistic
battles over the B-word will prove a distraction from putting in place a
proper system of authority and accountability.

George Hume reports on the cash problems that face the Church and why
members will have to dig deeper
THE shrinking Church of Scotland, strapped for cash, its reserves
squeezed ever thinner, is not in debt -- and that's official. ''We do
not have a crisis,'' says Will Farrell, the Kirk's expert on just how
little comes in on the collection plate each Sunday. But, when the
General Assembly hears next week that congregations will have to chip in
three times as much as they do at present if the Church is to pay its
way and escape its parlous position, many Kirk stalwarts may believe
they are worshipping at St Andrews On the Brink.
Money -- the acute lack of it -- will be the big secular issue at this
year's General Assembly. Almost 75% of the Church's income comes from
members giving four-fifths of that through the weekly expression of
congregations' generosity. But at an average of just over #1 a week from
each member that largesse is, simply, not enough.
As Assembly commissioners and officials of the Church's Board of
Stewardship and Finance struggle to square the circle of inadequate
giving and increasing demand they may pause to marvel at -- the less
pious be envious of -- the level of giving in other churches offering
counsel and comfort in Scotland.
Farrell has an explanation for the gap between the apparent financial
ease of some churches and the ever-tightening belt of the Church of
Scotland. ''These are gathered congregations whereas the Church of
Scotland will take anyone. These other churches have a committed
membership.''
In cash terms committed members, ''gathered congregations'', do well
by their church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints -- the
Mormons -- requires members to tithe 10% of their income if they are to
be deemed ''Temple Worthy''. Scottish members -- there is no breakdown
for Scotland of the Church's 170,000 members throughout the United
Kingdom -- are said to be some of the most faithful, ''very
conscientious'' in attending the Temple, an act which can only be
carried out if the member holds a ''recommend'' which, in turn, can only
be obtained if the 10% of income has been paid.
Closer to home the Free Church of Scotland, with around 6000 and a
further 14,500 adherents, last year enjoyed an income from giving of
#2,378,153 . . . an average annual figure for both members and adherents
of #116, virtually double the sum put in the plate by their Church of
Scotland brethren and a figure itself exceeded by Quaker giving the
Society of Friends' 700 members in Scotland, and a like number of
attenders, averaging #150 a year.
The debt-ridden Catholic Church in Scotland, overdrawn by #8m two
years ago, has managed to stimulate giving from an average of 70p per
week for every member -- the Catholic Church counts in its 760,000
strength all who are baptised -- to #1.50, still #1 short of the weekly
target of #2.50 set when the crisis broke, but none the less moving
firmly in the right direction. Almost #3m has already been wiped off the
burden of debt.
Where the Catholic Church in Scotland has managed to double its
members' giving the Church of Scotland requires its members to treble
theirs. Can it reach its target? According to Will Farrell the answer is
''yes'' and the vehicle education. ''The problem when it comes to giving
is racial memory, by which I mean people thinking back to those days
when members did not need to give at all to support the Church,'' says
Farrell.
''They may have given a penny for the poor and another penny for the
foreign mission but the financial burden of maintaining their Church was
met from endowments, glebe rents, feu incomes and the like. That is no
longer the case -- these days are long gone -- but a Church member who
today gives #1 a week, set against that memory, thinks they are doing
rather well by the Church when, in fact, they are not.''
The fact is that those members of the Church of Scotland who do give
make a much greater contribution than the average of #59.24 shown in the
books. The Kirk estimates that of the total membership of 715,571 only
one third is fully committed to the work of the Church and gives a
figure that must work out in excess of #3 a week. Another third of the
membership, says Farrell, ''moves within the Church'', while the
remaining third is ''on the fringe''.
Says Farrell: ''I have a great faith in the Lord but not in all the
members. The straitened position in which the Church finds itself is all
about perception, not financial. We have to make it clear to members
that they are not involved in fund-raising but in Christian giving. It
is not a question of a great push and then settling back at that for a
few years -- giving has to increase sharply and thereafter increase
every year if the Church is to be properly supported in its work.''
The average congregation gives #40,000 a year when what is needed is
#120,000. The gap, says Will Farrell, is ''just too great''. The Church
is striving to encourage members to make a firm commitment to contribute
an additional one per cent of their annual income and to continue to do
so each year until they consider they are giving generously and
proportionate to that income.
In terms of pounds and pence such a target, if taken on and achieved,
would mean an average increase in each member's giving of #120 in the
first year alone -- the Church estimating that the average net income of
its members stands at around #12,000 a year.
Figures to be put before the General Assembly show that congregations
have largely failed to act to rescue their Church from its financial
predicament. Although there was an increase in congregational income
last year of almost #2.5m -- a rise of almost 3.8% and well above the
rate of inflation which last year stood at 2.5% -- in simple cash terms
per capita offerings rose by just over #4 in the full year, a meagre 8p
per person per week.
While declaring it ''a source of satisfaction and gratitude'' that the
per capita givings of members have risen in excess of the increases in
both retail prices and average incomes over the past decade, the Church
stresses that the increases are based on a low starting level of giving
-- Farrell's ''racial memory'' -- with the accounts showing that as
recently as 1989 per capita offerings amounted to no more than #39.14.
In addition, the General Assembly will hear that the benefits of
increased giving are each year offset by the decline in the number of
members. The 1994 drop in membership -- some 17,400 -- would require
more than one million pounds more from those remaining to make good the
loss. Expenditure in the year ahead, it will be made clear, must be
trimmed to fit income.
Says Farrell: ''The Church is not in debt, we do not have a crisis, we
are able to balance our books. But members must think about their
giving. It is right that there should always be a healthy tension
between the Church's ambition and its resources -- we live on the edge
of financial decisions -- and although there will always have to be
these decisions Church members will have to recognise that a much
greater level of giving is needed if the Church is to continue all its
work. What we are doing today is cutting everything from our existing
financial cake when what we really need to do is bake a much bigger
cake.''
* THE Scots Kirk in Paris, headquarters of an escape line for hundreds
of British troops during the last war, is facing closure owing to a lack
of cash. The Rev Dr Donald Caskie -- the so-called Tartan Pimpernel --
masterminded the freedom route to Spain from the church at 17 Rue Bayard
before falling into the hands of the Gestapo. Held in solitary
confinement, often on a diet of bread and water, he was released when
Paris fell to the allies in August 1944.
Now the late Donald Caskie's church is in bad repair. It urgently
needs work costing #50,000 but has an annual income of #10,000 less, a
regular Sunday attendance of just 50, a ''contact list'' of only 150 and
will this year require a subsidy from Church funds intended for the
Third World.
Faced by a recommendation from the Assembly Council that the Church's
overseas budget be cut by 10% in order to make ends meet, the Board of
World Mission is pressing the congregation in Paris to act and stand on
its own feet. A would-be purchaser has offered in the #650,000 for the
church building and Dr Wigglesworth Board is urging the congregation to
sell and make arrangements to worship, with their minister, in one of
the other Reformed churches in Paris.
''The congregation would like us to continue to shell out the 40% of
total costs of the Scots Kirk in Paris, a subsidy which at present
amounts to about #30,000 a year. But that is not possible,'' he said.

* A new recruitment campaign has been launched to address the critical
shortage of Gaelic teachers.
A careers package has been prepared by Gaelic development agency
Comunn na Gaidhlig in association with the Scottish Office education
department and will be distributed throughout schools, colleges,
universities, and careers events.
Until the end of the century, CNAG estimates 35 new Gaelic primary
teachers will be needed annually to cater for even a modest growth in
students of the language. Ten years ago there were no Gaelic schools.
There are now 47.

* A Sutherland woman is being flooded with phone-calls congratulating
her conquest of Everest -- in fact, the highest Mrs Kath Ballard has
been is 1217ft up Ben Bhraggie behind her home in Seaforth Road,
Golspie.
The problem has arisen because Mrs Ballard's husband, John, is the
only J. Ballard in the Highlands and Islands directory. Mrs Alison
Hargreaves, who became the first woman to climb Everest unaided and
without oxygen, is married to photographer Mr Jim Ballard, of Spean
Bridge, and they are not listed in the telephone directory.

THE future of Gaelic soap opera Machair has been guaranteed for at
least the next three years following a funding agreement between
Scottish Television and the Comataidh Telebhisein Gaidhlig, the Gaelic
Television Committee.
The deal also ensures the programme will continue to be made on
location in the Western Isles. In earlier discussions, Scottish
Television had put forward the option of moving part of the filming to
its Glasgow studios because bad weather conditions on location were
interrupting production. The proposal was strongly opposed by the local
community which benefits from commercial spin-offs.
Scottish Television now expects to conclude a deal with Western Isles
Enterprise and Comhairle Nan Eilean to build a basic studio for Machair
in the isles. This will enable filming to continue whatever the weather.
The new agreement, funding for which will come from the CTG's #2.2m
allocation for serial drama, secures continuity for the next 78
half-hour episodes. Previously, Scottish Television had to approach the
CTG for funding on an annual basis.
The crew are currently in the Western isles filming the sixth series.
Mr Alistair Moffat, chief executive of Scottish Television
Enterprises, said: ''This allows planning of a sort not previously
available for Machair. We can build on Gaelic-speaking talents in a
structured way, both in front and behind the camera.''

A RAPIST who subjected a 14-year-old girl to a terrifying sex attack
as she took a shortcut through a cemetery, was jailed for eight years
yesterday.
Lord Weir told William Nicholson ''What you did to that innocent girl
of tender years was unforgiveable. The crime which you perpetrated was a
terrible one. It is one of the most serious cases I have come across for
some time.''
The judge was told that Nicholson's victim suffered severe
psychological distress because of her ordeal. The only factor in his
favour was that he had admitted the crime and spared the girl the ordeal
of having to give evidence.
Nicholson, 36, a landscape gardener of Templeland Road, Pollok,
Glasgow, admitted raping the girl at Craigton cemetery, Cardonald, on
Janaury 6 this year.
His victim was taking a shortcut through the graveyard when Nicholson
grabbed her by the arm. She managed to break free, but the accused kept
following her.
He grabbed her, pulled her into undergrowth, pushed her on to her back
and raped her. The girl screamed but was warned: ''Shut up if you know
what is good for you.''
She managed to escape when Nicholson stumbled and fell into dense
undergrowth and ran naked from the waist down to a relative's house.
Nicholson, a first offender, had been working with a squad of men
clearing bushes and undergrowth in the disused graveyard. He had been
drinking before the attack on the girl.
He originally pleaded guilty at the High Court in Glasgow and Lord
Weir deferred sentence to obtain a psychiatric report.
At the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, Mr Tom Welsh, defence
counsel, told the judge that Nicholson appeared to be a shy introverted
and somewhat lonely man.
He had been segregated from other prisoners in Barlinnie since his
detention in January and was terrified of the circumstances in which he
found himself.

THE chairman of Cunard, is to leave ''by mutual agreement'' just five
months after the disastrous Christmas voyage of the shipping line's
flagship, the QE2, it was announced yesterday.
Trafalgar House, Cunard's parent company, said Mr John Olsen was
leaving its board and that of Cunard ''to pursue other interests''.
A Trafalgar House spokesman said yesterday: ''Mr Olsen joined on a
two-year contract with an option to review it for an extra year. The
two-year contract was due to be completed on May 31 and by mutual
agreement Mr Olsen will not be staying on after that.''
The chairman of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Mr Peter Ward, will replace Mr
Olsen on the Trafalgar and Cunard boards.
Cunard suffered a #6.9m loss for the six months to the end of March
1995.
Trouble for both Mr Olsen and the 66,000-tonne QE2 began when the
vessel went to Germany for a #30m refit last year.
Cunard was confident the 27 days set aside for the refit would be
adequate. But the vessel returned with much still to be done, including
vital plumbing.
A cruise to the Bay of Biscay was cancelled and the Christmas cruise
to New York on December 17 suffered flooding due to plumbing problems.
Mr Olsen joined the ship at New York to discuss passengers'
grievances. But later US coastguards prevented the liner sailing to the
Caribbean because of fire hazards and safety violations.
Cunard had to set aside #7.5m to compensate passengers.

A SCOTS mountaineer has abandoned plans to scale Everest because there
is no room at the top of the world.
Mr Dave Rowe had hoped to undertake an expedition to the Himalayan
peak, but discovered it is fully booked.
Instead, Mr Rowe, 34, of Blairgowrie, and three companions will head
to Greenland later this month to climb uncharted peaks.
The full-time mountaineer explained: ''I had thought of going to the
Himalayas, but Everest is just too busy. The mountain is fully booked
for some time.
''There're so many sightseers in the Himalayas as well that
mountaineers can't get up there and it makes it a bit less of a
wilderness.''
He described the Greenland trip as ''the challenge of a lifetime''.
He explained: ''It's uncharted territory and we'll be putting up new
routes. There are no guide books.

<HEADLINE>Minister ready to steer away from Howard line. Fraser in bid to reassure police</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>JAMES FREEMAN, HOME AFFAIRS REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978321635</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Home Affairs Minister Lord Fraser is understood to be ready
to distance himself and the Scottish Office from the thinking of Home
Secretary Michael Howard on the future of Britain's police forces when
he addresses top Scottish policemen in Peebles today.
He is expected to offer reassurance instead of confrontation, and in
particular to emphasise that Scotland need not necessarily swallow whole
the police core functions review, which is based almost entirely on
English and Welsh experience.
His speech may go some way to allaying fears voiced by Strathclyde's
Chief Constable Mr Leslie Sharp in his attack on Government police
policy at the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents'
conference.
Lord Fraser, it is understood, will stress that any plans taken on
board north of the Border would be subject to the widest consultation.
He is also likely to be conciliatory over the fears of senior officers
about fixed-term contracts and appraisal-related pay which, he is
expected to emphasise, will not be based on arrests or league tables.
But there is much scepticism among police on this matter, and it is
likely to remain, despite Government claims that people like Mr Sharp
are projecting worst-case scenarios.
The association's agenda this week has reflected many of the same
preoccupations as those voiced by Mr Sharp, including strong misgivings
that fixed-term appointments and performance related pay will undermine
the traditional independence of chief officers.
There are also grave doubts over the Home Office review of core
functions -- an exercise to save money by seeing which bits of the
police service could be hived off to private security, Mr Sharp
maintained.
It became apparent yesterday that the ''Spare a Copper'' lecture had
provided a focus for police concerns at every rank.
General secretary of the Scottish Police Federation Mr Douglas Keil
said: ''What Mr Sharp said in his lecture reflects exactly what we
consider to be the major dangers facing the police service in the UK.
The Government is proposing root and branch changes which will be to no
one's benefit.''
Mr Tom Rowatt, secretary of the federation branch in Strathclyde
police, added: ''There is no doubt in my mind that the police service
should be professionally managed and accountable to the general public,
with whose consent it polices.
''I believe that these principles are firmly based at the moment, but
that they are being threatened by dogma from a Government driven by
making profits for 'haves', while ignoring the effects that these
policies will produce on the 'have nots'.''
Mr Rowatt said that the only thing which could now prevent the total
destruction of the police service as we know it was a change of heart by
the Government on the privatisation of the public service, or a change
in government itself.
The opposition was not slow to side with the police service against Mr
Howard's perceived excesses. Mr John McFall, Labour's Scottish spokesman
on home affairs, told the association that the Government held the
narrow belief that cutting costs was in itself a form of efficiency.
''The narrowing of police officers' responsibilities is superficially
attractive to the Treasury eye. If you can identify tasks which can be
performed by operatives who cost less and require less training and
investment than it takes to produce a fully-trained constable you can
privatise these roles, instantly reduce the workload of the police, cut
police numbers and save costs,'' he said.
At one level -- traffic wardens and typists -- that might work, but it
was simplistic to take it too far.
Referring to Mr Sharp's misgivings about the increasing role for
private security companies, Mr McFall added: ''Communities which are
desperate to deal with crime are being tempted to take the law into
their own hands as vigilantes, or to pay out hard cash for private
companies to do it for them. Attracted by a market which is almost free
of regulation, new companies -- some operated by people whose record
gives the police cause for concern -- are moving in to offer their
services.
''To go back to the days when private police forces existed on the
basis of the wealth of those who employed them would be to return to the
worst sort of basics -- the law of the jungle,'' Mr McFall said.

RENFREW District Council is to set up its own investigation into the
activities of the Ferguslie-based security company, FCB Enterprise
Security Ltd, which is currently being investigated by the police.
A motion by the leader of the main opposition SNP group, Councillor
Bruce McFee, to set up an inquiry into the company, its contracts with
the council and its employment practices was passed last night by 23
votes to 13, with one abstention. Three rebel Labour councillors voted
for the motion, and 13 members of the controlling Labour group voted
against.
The working party will be made up of three Labour group nominees, two
from the SNP, one Conservative and one Liberal-Democrat or non-aligned
party member.
Councillor McFee told the meeting that FCB was given the security
contract -- a single tender contract -- because it claimed it would
create local employment and it would pay #3.60 an hour to employees.
He claimed that the company had, however, paid people on the dole who
were claiming social security benefits #1.50 an hour ''cash in hand''.
As the contract was based on hours worked by employees on #3.60 an hour,
he asked: ''Where did the balance go?''
He also alleged that ''ghosting'' practices had been carried out by
FCB employees, in which fewer staff were on duty than the contract had
dictated.
Councillor Olga Clayton, a member of the council's Labour group and a
director of the company, said she welcomed any investigation.

* Two senior Grampian Police officers returned to Aberdeen last night
after an unsuccessful attempt to speak to the protesters occupying the
Brent Spar.
The protesters have now spent almost three weeks on board the
redundant tanker-loading terminal 118 miles north-east of Shetland.
Superintendent Mike Tucker and Inspector Harry Ord, of the offshore
industries liaison unit, flew yesterday to the nearby Brent Alpha
platform, but Greenpeace refused them permission to land on the Brent
Spar. The officers were also unable to arrange a face-to-face meeting on
a vessel.
A spokesman said the purpose of the visit had been to make those on
Brent Spar fully aware of the situation regarding the civil proceedings
which Shell is taking.

THE director of the National Galleries of Scotland, Mr Timothy
Clifford, will find out today if he has been appointed as the new
director of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London, ending weeks of
speculation.
Last night an unusually publicity-shy Mr Clifford was unavailable for
comment.
A National Galleries of Scotland spokeswoman said: ''The V&amp;A are
keeping things very, very close to their chest. We will have to wait
until an announcement is made.''
The V&amp;A said that four candidates had been interviewed by a selection
committee for the prestigious #63,000-a-year post currently held by Mrs
Elizabeth Esteve-Coll. But they declined to say who the applicants had
been, or even who had been on the selection committee.
The museum's spokeswoman, Tracey Williamson, said that from that list
one name had been selected and given to the museum's 17-strong board of
trustees for approval yesterday afternoon. That name had then to be
approved by the Prime Minister before the candidate was notified.

SIX people were arrested yesterday when demonstrators tried to force
their way into Shell's annual general meeting in London.
About 50 protesters, unhappy with the oil company's activities in
Nigeria, ran towards the Queen Elizabeth conference centre.
When they could get no further than the lobby, they staged a sit-down
protest before being dragged away by police.
There were scenes of mayhem as officers struggled with the
demonstrators as shareholders queued to get into the meeting.
Generally, police were content to repel bids by the protesters to
enter the building. However, two people were charged with breach of the
peace, one with assault on a police officer, and three with criminal
damage.
Two protesters managed to scale a canopy at the front of the building
and stayed there for two hours. They burned a Shell flag before lowering
themselves down to police.
The protest was organised by Shell Out, a coalition of environmental
and human rights campaigners formed to highlight Shell's activities in
Nigeria.
They allege collusion between the oil firm and military forces in
Nigeria, and devastation of land belonging to the Ogoni people in the
Niger Delta. Shell denies the allegations.
A spokesman for the company said yesterday: ''Shell is not in
collusion with the military. It has repeatedly condemned violence by
anyone.
''Shell has not devastated the environment. Where we are responsible
for problems, we are committed to remedial action. We are carrying out a
rolling programme, spending, for instance, well over #60m in 1995 for
environmental improvements.
''Many factors have contributed to environmental problems in the Niger
Delta. To determine the facts, Shell is funding a #1.2m independent
environmental study.''
The spokesman said Shell had withdrawn from the Ogoni area in January
1993 because of violence and threats of violence against staff. He added
that its oil production from the area ceased in the middle of that year.
''We have said we will not return to Ogoni unless we can work in
harmony alongside the communities.''
Shell believes communities have been pressing for a greater share of
oil revenues from government, political self-determination, and mineral
rights. It said communities and other organisations had attacked the
company to raise the profile of their campaign to international level.

A JUDGE will decide today whether to grant an order to eject
physically a dozen Greenpeace protesters who are occupying the disused
Brent Spar oil terminal in the North Sea.
Brent Spar's owner, Shell UK, asked Lord Johnston for an order for
summary ejection of the protesters, who are objecting to plans to sink
the installation in the Atlantic.
Shell is unaware of the identity of 11 of the protesters and the judge
will have to decide whether a court order against unnamed persons is
competent under Scots law.
Mr Gerald Moynihan, counsel for Shell, told the judge at the Court of
Session that Lord Kirkwood had already granted an interdict to ban the
protesters from occupying the platform.
Last Friday night, messengers-at-arms were flown by helicopter to the
platform and served Lord Kirkwood's order on 12 individuals. Only one, a
man called Mr Jonathan Castle, was prepared to give his name.
Mr Moynihan told the court that the protesters were trespassing, had
been ordered to leave by the court but had refused to do so and were on
the Brent Spar in contempt of the court order. Shell had a right at
common law to remove people from the rig, but the protesters had
threatened passive resistance against any such attempts.
In a fax sent from the Brent Spar, Mr Castle had said that the
protesters were prepared to put themselves at risk for the higher
purpose of protecting the ocean and the planet from destruction.
However, by implication, they had said they would not resist removal
attempts by duly authorised court officers.
Mr Moynihan said the issue was whether the court would make an order
of ejection and assist Shell achieve the removal with the minimum risk
of confrontation.
''If your lordship refuses, you will be signalling the impotence of
this court against people who sit on an oil rig in the North Sea and, in
effect, blow raspberries. Can the court, in the face of stubborn
resistance from a class of people intent on resistance, do nothing? That
would be an absurdity.''
Mr Moynihan made it clear that Shell was not asking for the protesters
to be sent to prison until they had obeyed Lord Kirkwood's order. They
were martyrs to a cause and jailing them would be rewarding them by
fuelling the publicity they desired. They would simply be taken off the
platform by helicopter and conveyed to Aberdeen.
Mr Jonathan Mitchell, QC, counsel for Mr Castle, asked Lord Johnston
not to grant an eviction order against his client. He said Mr Castle had
not had the chance to take legal advice on the interim interdict granted
by Lord Kirkwood and it could not be assumed at this stage that he was
in contempt of that order.
As far as the other 11 unnamed protesters were concerned, the order
Shell was asking for was incompetent. He was unaware of any practice by
the Scottish courts of granting orders against people who could not be
named in the order.
It was a cardinal feature of Scots law that court orders should be
restricted to specific individuals.
It was his understanding that, with with the exception of Mr Castle,
most of the others on the Brent Spar when the order was served last
Friday night had left and others had taken their place.

A SCOTTISH lecturer in an Italian university who claims he is the
victim of illegal discrimination has urged the European Commission to
apply economic sanctions against the Italian government.
Professor David Petrie, 43, a lecturer in languages and literature,
has suffered substantial cuts in wages and conditions at the University
of Verona along with 13 other foreigners while their Italian colleagues
have received pay rises and promotion.
His case -- supported several times by the European Court of Justice
in Luxembourg -- has been taken up by Euro-MP Hugh McMahon, whose
Strathclyde West constituency includes Dumbarton, Mr Petrie's home town.
Mr Petrie yesterday led a delegation of the lecturers to the European
Parliament in Strasbourg where Mr McMahon called on the Commission to
cut funding for educational programmes until the Italians respected
European law.
''The Italians are just ignoring European law point blank -- it is a
scandal,'' Mr Petrie complained.
Mr McMahon said: ''It is deplorable that EU citizens are receiving
such treatment at the hands of an EU member state. The EU is supposed to
promote opportunities for citizens to work across the Union. The Italian
authorities are breaking EU law by refusing to grant equal status to
non-Italian nationals.''
After complaints to the university authorities recently the foreigners
were told their salaries were being cut by 15% and they were ordered
into smaller offices, Mr Petrie said. An attempt was also made to
reclassify the lecturers as laboratory assistants so that the wage cuts
could be justified.
Mr McMahon accused the Commission of being lax in supporting Mr
Petrie's clear right to equal treatment. ''Despite the fine words and
rhetoric, the Commission at the moment is not implementing the powers it
currently has,'' he said.
A Commission statement noted that there were problems for foreign
language-lecturers in Italy. The legal situation in Italy was
unsatisfactory, it said, adding that it would continue infringement
proceedings opened in 1992 against Italy.

LABOUR last night condemned a a $4m US Government reward for the
capture of the two alleged Lockerbie bombers -- and demanded to know if
Britain had been consulted.
The offer, and the inclusion of the two men on the FBI's Ten Most
Wanted Fugitives list, had ''the ring of banditry'', said Lord Macaulay.
He demanded to know if the Crown Office , responsible for the Scottish
prosecution of the two men, had been consulted or whether the FBI had
made a unilateral declaration.
Lord Macaulay, Opposition spokesman in the Lords on Scottish legal
matters and Shadow Lord Advocate, voiced his alarm in a letter to the
Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger.
The FBI said in March it had put the two Libyans accused of the
bombing, Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, on its Ten
Most Wanted list and that the US Government would offer a $4m reward for
information leading to their arrest.
The two were charged in 1991 with planting the bomb that destroyed
PanAm Flight 103 over Lockerbie with the loss of 270 lives in December
1988.
Lord Macaulay said the offer could encourage bounty- hunters.
It also could lead to difficulties if the two Libyans stood trial in
Scotland, only for the trial to collapse if there was a successful
defence claim that a fair trial was impossible on pre-trial publicity
grounds.
In his letter, Lord Macaulay asked if the Americans had consulted
Britain before the FBI move and if not, whether the Crown Office had
registered a protest.
''The offer made has a ring of international banditry about it and
will subject both subjects to the implied threat that even if they leave
Libya to stand trial in Scotland and were acquitted, whether on
preliminary argument regarding publicity being successful or otherwise,
they will be under the threat of capture by the FBI to stand another
trial in the United States.''
The Crown Office said: last night: ''We cannot comment until we have
seen Lord Macaulay's letter.''

MPs YESTERDAY were thinking about things that could destroy jobs --
like the minimum wage, the Social Chapter and some of the Nolan
Committee recommendations.
Most Tories are vocally averse to the first two, a number think the
third might destroy their jobs in the sense of making them less
attractive than they now are.
Realising that the terms of their contracts to represent United
Umbrellas or Taxidermists Anonymous could be exposed to the public gaze
has made them react in the manner of shop assistants told that opening
hours are being changed from nine to five, to seen to eight.
There is sneaking admiration for Mr Tony Blair who has tackled his
problem with the minimum wage by announcing that he is standing by the
principle but will only start thinking about how to implement it once he
is elected.
One Tory school of thought believes that this wheeze would work for
Nolan. Reaffirm your commitment to high standards in public life, but
defer action on any painful changes until after the next election when
some will no longer be in a position to hold parliamentary
consultancies.
Mr Major resolutely refused to respond to prods from Mr Blair to give
a personal view on all this, but laid into the European job destroyers,
the Wage and the Chapter, with gusto.
And while ''opportunities for profitable consultancies'' may have to
be deleted from the Westminster job specification, we were reminded of
other hidden hazards that face our sturdy legislators.
There is the Whips' book recording the personal peccadilloes of those
Members who are interesting enough to have any. Like almost everything
else connected with this struggling administration it is the Government
Whips' dirt book which has come into the full glare of publicity.
But, gentle reader, do not be shocked if the Sketch reveals that
similar records are kept by the great Opposition Party's Whips. The
binding may be less elaborate, but the information necessary to bring
all but aspirants to sainthood to their knees and into the right lobby
is there.
The secret gambler at tiddlywinks, the real ale person who guzzles
champagne in the privacy of his or her own home. They are all there. If
dramatised, the Whips' books would make compelling television, after the
nine o'clock 'clock watershed of course.
The smaller parties are sufficiently small for all their Members'
oddities not to require elaborate record-keeping.
Mr Tony Banks (Newham North-West -- Lab.), like the rest of us,
believes that to know the Government Whips' book exists is not enough.
It should be published.
He confessed that it was the ''jucier'' Members' interests he was
interested in, not the tedious stuff about finance.
Paying what some might regard as a back-handed compliment, he enquired
if it was true that the Government Whips had now gone into a second
volume and were thinking they might require a loose-leaf format.
The Commons Leader, Mr Tony Newton, is rumoured to have taken to
chain-smoking after being shown his first glimpse of the Book as a
junior Whip. He reverted to his old role and kept mum. He went on to
become Government Chief Whip, a post which leaves one as unsurprised by
the vagaries of human nature as the Head of MI5, the general of the
Jesuits, or a holiday tour guide.
As their party lurches from one public relations disaster to another,
Tory MPs are eyeing the steady convergence of opinion poll data and the
next General Election date with increasing anxiety. Even some of those
who believe they can survive fear they may return to a Commons where the
doctrine of the maximum wage holds stern sway.

THE Government was strongly criticised last night over its response to
the Nolan Committee report on standards in public life.
In a highly-charged Commons debate on the committee's recommendations,
Public Service Minister David Hunt pledged that some of the Nolan
proposals would be implemented.
However, it was clear that many key recommendations were being put on
hold for further examination and that the Government was anxious to have
further consultation.
Last night's debate followed the recent publication of the Nolan
report into standards in public life, thrown into stark relief by the
''cash for questions'' scandal and the controversy surrounding Tory MP
Sir Jerry Wiggin.
Key recommendations of the report included:
* A ban on MPs working for lobbying companies.
* Full disclosure of MPs' earnings and contracts for providing
parliamentatry services.
* A code of conduct setting out how MPs are expected to behave, and a
clearer code of conduct for Ministers.
Last night, Mr Hunt said the Government was ready to take ''early
action'' on the recommendations, but it was clear that the Government
intended further review.
He said there were many complex issues of detail, and emphasised: ''We
must ensure the recommendations would indeed achieve their aims. We will
have to examine these issues carefully and resolve any difficulties
before implementation.''
For Labour, Shadow Leader of the Commons Ann Taylor, urging Government
action, said; ''Whether it is cash for questions or cash for amendments
we cannot pretend that there is not a very real problem here.''
The debate was marked by a contribution from former Tory Prime
Minister Sir Edward Heath, who felt the House could police itself.
Leading the charge against hasty change, Sir Edward, who is Father of
the House, He said: ''We in this House know far more of what is going on
with our fellow members than any bureaucrat brought in from outside. Of
course we do.''
He continued: ''What can this gentleman do? He can't come into the
smoke room and say, 'By the way, have you heard so--and-so about
so-and-so? Do you think I ought to look at that?' Of course not.''
Sir Edward said: ''What saddens me about Lord Nolan is that he is an
admirable judge but to me he seems to lack a certain worldliness, of
realising what actually goes on in this world of ours.
''We have got to be careful that we don't fall into that trap.''
Outside the Commons, one Tory MP, Alan Duncan, confronted Lord Nolan
-- on his way to the House to hear the debate.
Mr Duncan told him bluntly: ''You are about to obliterate the
professional classes' representation in the House of Commons.''
The MP for Rutland and Melton added: ''It is a very, very dangerous
game.''
Earlier, the Prime Minister told MPs that the Government ''broadly
accepted'' the committee's recommendations, declaring: ''It's important
that not only do we ensure high standards but that the people of this
country see for themselves that this House adopts high standards.''
However, when Mr Hunt promised MPs they would have the ''final say''
on more controversial plans to curb their outside work, he swiftly ran
into a barrage of protests from senior Tories.
Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton South-West) warned against a ''panic
response'' and called for any material changes in MPs' terms of office
to be decided through ''slow deliberation'' by statute.
Former Tory Minister Tristan Garel-Jones (Watford) suggested the
detailed changes should be referred to a senior Commons committee for
careful deliberation and another Tory ex-Minister Sir Giles Shaw
(Pudsey) said this could act as a ''conduit through which Nolan can be
rationalised into what's practical''.
In an intervention, Tory Anthony Steen (South Hams) drew Tory cheers
when he protested: ''I deeply resent the inference in Nolan that all of
us are crooks.''
Winding up the debate, which ended without a vote, Commons Leader Tony
Newton said the key point was to go forward ''with proper care'' but
without delay.
''We've got to get it right,'' he insisted.
Mr Newton said: ''One possibility would be for me to come forward with
resolutions but I have grave doubts whether that purpose would be
appropriate or right.
''The appropriate course is to operate according to what the House
would normally do in such circumstances which is to ask a group of
senior and respected members to make recommendations about how we should
proceed in the light of the report and to put forward specific proposals
for resolutions which might be put to the House.''
Mr Nigel Spearing (Newham South -- Lab.) said: ''The real problem is
that too many MPs regard a seat here as a negotiable asset for private
gain rather than a basis for a vocation.''
However, Nolan Committee member and Tory former Cabinet Minister Tom
King defended lobbying as an ''essential part of the democratic
process''.
He insisted: ''It is not only allowable but actually valuable for MPs
to have outside interests and involvements, because it widens the
experience and contribution they can make.''.
Tory ex-Minister Sir Archibald Hamilton (Epsom and Ewell) said he was
disappointed with the Nolan report.
''It must be a good thing to get professional middle class people to
come into this House,'' he said. ''If they are being told they have got
to do this on a salary of #32,000 a year, to be quite honest they are
not going to come.''
Sir Dudley Smith (Warwick and Leamington -- Con.) complained that
''parliamentary sovereignty is really being undermined'' by Nolan, whom
he described as ''an over-zealous headmaster''.
Labour left-winger Tony Benn (Chesterfield) said MPs might as well
give up if they did not take a ''strong line against the commercial
corruption of Parliament''.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Robert Maclennan argued that a pay rise
for MPs and a written constitution would help resolve the problem.
British politics, he said, was ''gratifyingly clean'' compared to some
countries.
Members' Interests Select Committee chairman Sir Geoffrey Johnson
Smith (Wealden -- Con.) warned of the Nolan report: ''There is an awful
lot in this and a lot needs to be thought out, and I do think we are in
danger of under-estimating some of the complications -- deciding what
should and should not be registered.
''I am not at all convinced the Government would be wise to rush into
this. There are a lot of hurdles on the way.''

THE heated debate in the Commons came amid the continuing row over the
tabling of an amendment in another MP's name by former Tory Minister Sir
Jerry Wiggin.
He could face suspension from the House.
Sir Jerry, who is in South Africa leading a group of six other MPs on
an investigation into fruit and vegetable farming, is due to check out
of his Cape Town hotel today,
Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd has said she is ''seriously
examining'' calls for a full investigation into claims that Sir Jerry
broke parliamentary rules in an apparent bid to change a Bill in which
he had a financial interest.
The matter is now expected to end up before the powerful privileges
committee -- which could recommend punishments ranging from a severe
reprimand to suspension from the Commons.

Meanwhile, Scotland's new councils are being encouraged to share
expertise and facilities up to an annual value of #25,000, without
having to carry out competitive tendering, writes JOHN McCALMAN.
The relaxation of Government rules is designed to mitigate an
''unintended'' surge in costs that would arise from the extension of
compulsory competitive tendering to the provision of professional
services.
Mr Kynoch said the exemptions would allow an authority to carry out
work for another body, without the CCT rules applying, where the annual
value of the work is less than #25,000.

LABOUR Party ''spin doctors'' have raised the temperature in the
battle for the leadership of the transport union by heavily promoting
the views of challenger Jack Dromey, who has accused the present general
secretary, Mr Bill Morris, of undermining the party's election chances.
The Transport and General Workers' Union is the largest affiliate of
the party, and the lobbying taking place on behalf of Mr Dromey is
widely interpreted as the continuing emergence of New Labour and
something of a pay-back for Mr Morris's opposition to the party
leadership on Clause 4.
Mr Dromey, who is married to Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet
Harman, probably is best known in Scotland for his close involvement in
campaigns to save jobs at Rosyth dockyard and the Ordnance factory at
Bishopton.
Currently the union's national secretary, Mr Dromey played the Labour
Party card in a key speech to TGWU members in Chester entitled ''A union
in crisis theatening the chances of a Labour Government''.
In it, he spoke of TGWU members being deperate for a Labour Government
yet ''year in,year out, the current union leadership threatened the
chances of a Labour Government.''
In recent years, he said, it had been Bill Morris against John Smith
on one member-one vote or Bill Morris against Tony Blair on reform of
Clause 4 and now there was the prospect of Bill Morris versus Tony Blair
on economic policy at year's annual party conference in Brighton.
TGWU members were crying out for change , crying out for a Labour
Government led by Mr Blair. That was what the TGWU election was all
about -- a strong trade union alongside a strong Labour Government not
an irrelevant union constantly undermining Labour and its leaders.
He suggested that Bill Morris was now only seen in public attacking
the Labour Party. That would not be his approach, Mr Dromey said,
adding: ''While Bill Morris battles with Tony Blair to the dismay of our
members, I fight bad employers and take on the Tories.''
Mr Morris, who has called an election a year before his intitial
five-year term of office was due to expire next May, immediately
condemned the attack as ''the desperate speech of a defeated candidate
who has run out of ideas ,support and, apparently, any loyalty to the
organisation he works for.''
Recalling how Mr Dromey had promised not to attack him personally or
the union or make the Labour Party a campaign issue, he said he had now
broken all three promises, dragging the union through the mud and
dragging the Labour Party into the campaign.
''And he has attacked me for repesenting our union's policies as
determined by the membership.This is not a man the members can trust'',
he declared.
He said that under his leadership ''no-one will do more than the TGWU
to fight for the re-election of a Labour government.
Nominations for the increasingly bitter contest close today when it is
expected they will show something in the region of a 3-1 ratio for Mr
Morris who also has the support of six of the eight regional
secretaries. However previous elections have shown that such support
does not necessarily translate into members' votes.
The Dromey camp and the Labour leadership believe their man will be
swept to office on a tide of support for New Labour which would bring
the largest affiliate firmly on board.
However whoever wins will still have to report to the TGWU lay
executive which ,at least until it too comes up for relection at the end
of the year,remains distinctly Old Labour.

THREE curses hang over Labour candidate Douglas Alexander in this
by-election -- boyish good looks, intelligence, and vaulting
achievement.
The first he will certainly overcome in time, as 10 years from now he
will look his present age of 27.
The second he will get away with, since it has become more fashionable
under New Labour for the IQ to be worn on the sleeve, rather than having
something tattooed across the knuckles.
The third, however, will make it harder for him to wake up to defeat
next Friday morning for he is not someone accustomed to coming second.
Mr Alexander is much more personable on a one-to-one basis than in the
bear pit that passes for by-election press conferences, where he can
seem over-earnest and mechanical in the determination with which he
sticks to his party brief. ''Quite clearly,'' he will reply, before
going on to deliver a far from clear Blairite soundbite.
For example, in an effort to get behind this facade, one reporter this
week tried to find out what issues brought passion to the candidate's
political vision. ''What would you go to the stake for,'' he was asked.
Back came the wording of the party's new Clause 4 about ''power, wealth,
and opportunity in the hands of the many, not the few. '' An audible
groan ran round the room.
And yet, speaking yesterday in a calmer atmosphere, he waxed eloquent
and passionate about the anger and frustration at his coming of age
politically in the Thatcher years; of her denial of such a thing as
society; of young people unable to find a job and middle-class people
terrified of losing one; and of a Government obsessed by market forces
and devoid of moral leadership.
Why did these impassioned sentiments not come across better in the
formal encounters with the massed ranks of reporters? ''Candidates
should not just be there to make journalists' lives interesting,'' he
said.
''It becomes more like a pub quiz than a press conference and the
confrontational nature makes it hard to be friendly. Frankly, it's a bit
of a combat zone but I actually enjoy it.''
He has a point. If candidates keep the lid on their emotions and
responses, they are categorised as earnest and dull. If they respond
more openly they are criticised for being inexperienced and gaffe-prone.
The newspapers had Alexander marked down as diffident, lacking
confidence, over-confident, and having blown his top -- all at the same
meeting. ''Put me on the doorstep and it's not like that,'' he said.
The reference to blowing his top at one meeting this week may have
been over-stated, but he did appear distinctly tetchy when pushed on
whether he would regard coming second as a decent performance. He would
not be happy with that, he insisted.
Where does this competitive edge come from? ''If you care sufficiently
about what you're standing for, of course you have to win. In politics
there are no prizes for second place. We need this determination to
deliver for the people who are relying on us,'' he said.
He put his approach down to hard work and a belief in education and
application, instilled in him during an upbringing which most would
consider to have been a hot house environment.
He was born in Glasgow in 1967 and his father is still the local
minister at Bishopton, Renfrewshire. His mother, a haematologist in
north Ayrshire had become politicised through her experience of the
National Health Service and the young Douglas and his two sisters moved
as if by instinct into the Labour Party they regarded as their natural
political home.
His father, who numbers prominent Conservative Annabel Goldie among
his elders, avoids overt political involvement in his parish. But he,
too, carries a party card. Mr Alexander recalls an upbringing where
politics were discussed at the breakfast table, although he also had a
weakness for football. He has been hinting this week about an affection
for St Johnstone, but is keeping quiet about being a Rangers man.
At the local comprehensive school he claims a sense of humour helped
him avoid coming across as too ernest. ''Otherwise I would have known
about it soon enough and in any case you need a sense of humour to play
rugby of you are my size,'' he said.
From Park Mains High School he won a scholarship to one of the United
World Colleges in Vancouver, where he spent two years rubbing shoulders
with other bright youngsters from across the globe and taking part in
local services including operating the lifeboat and mountain rescue.
On his return, in 1986, he studied history and politics at Edinburgh
University. There he met the academic Paul Addison, who provided a link
with Gordon Brown, who was subsequently to take on Alexander as a
researcher after his graduation in 1990.
When Alexander won the nomination for the present by-election there
were some mutterings that ''Wendy's wee brother'' -- his sister was
well-known for as a researcher at Keir Hardie House -- had not fully
earned his chance through the grind of bearing local office, but had
been touched by greatness through his association with Gordon Brown.
He is a man who leaves little to chance. On the first day of the
campaign it was remarked that his thick mane of dark hair gave him a
passing resemblance to Michael Portillo. He went straight to the barber.
Like all candidates he has to insist that he can win but as a 4-1 shot
with the bookmakers, realistically his chance may have to come later.
One of the things he admits to being passionate about is a Scottish
parliament and he agrees that the Westminster lifestyle is far from
ideal.
In spite of his party's protests to the contrary, the barrage of
Shadow Ministers and the endorsement of Tony Blair will probably not be
enough to propel him to Westminster this time round. Already there is
dark talk of the next General Election or if only the campaign had been
given another week to gain momentum.
The truth is Labour will do well to come second, however painful that
experience may be for the high-flying Douglas Alexander, who will get
his chance to come first another time.

THE Prime Minister yesterday signalled a fresh row with the European
Commission, if power is further centralised in Brussels.
Such a move would ''split Europe asunder'', he told the Commons 24
hours after his meeting with EU President Jacques Santer.
''It is for national governments, not the European Commission, to take
decisions on Europe's future at the Inter-Governmental Conference. We
will certainly maintain the national veto and we will certainly not
accept any attempt to end the opt-outs that I negotiated in the
Maastricht Treaty.''
Mr Santer has alarmed Tory Euro-sceptics during a visit to Britain. He
has been arguing that an ''a la carte'' Europe, allowing member states
to pick and choose their commitments would not work.
Mr Major, questioned by his back benchers, yesterday insisted: ''The
proposition of a substantial amount of further centralisation, I
believe, would do great damage to Europe, would split it asunder and
ought to be resisted.''
He declared that British opt-outs on a single currency and the social
chapter are part of the Maastricht Treaty and are not for
re-negotiation.
He said: ''We are examing now in the detail the British-position in
Cabinet sub-committees as to how we will approach the IGC.
''When we have completed that detailed consideration, of course it
will be a matter to be discussed within the House. That was the case
before the Maastricht Treaty. It will be the case before the next IGC.''

SCOTTISH local government has nothing to fear from the setting up of a
Scottish parliament Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson pledged
yesterday.
He delighted council leaders by giving a clear promise that the Labour
legislation to set up the parliament would guarantee the powers and
responsibilities of local authorities.
This would keep them safe from any predatory instincts of central
government in the future, he said.
Speaking at the Making Change Happen conference on council
reorganisation in Dunblane, which is sponsored by Coopers and Lybrand,
Mr Robertson insisted that it was time to lay to rest the claims by Tory
Ministers that Labour's planned new legislative body would take powers
from local authorities.
He emphasised: ''There is no intention to devolve power from
Westminster simply to centralise it in the hands of people who happen to
be sitting in Edinburgh.''
Elected councillors had the right to know that the Scottish parliament
was not in the business of taking over the functions of local
government, he said.
He promised that the principle of entrenching the powers of local
government would be a significant part of the legislation to set up the
parliament.
Addressing the conference later, Mr George Kynoch, the Scottish Local
Government Minister, said that the speedy decisions of appointment of
chief executives showed that the new unitary councils were fully aware
of the importance of the timescale within which they were operating.
He praised the work done so far by inter-authority committees and said
he hoped that the co-operation would continue, right up until the new
councils took over next April.
However, the Minister added that he hoped the new authorities would
resist the temptation to try to deliver all the services themselves.
Mr Kynoch also warned that councillors in the new all-purpose
authorities would not be able to afford the luxury of involving
themselves in the day to day details of service delivery.

<HEADLINE>Blair back as party goes for broke. Tories now accused of telling defectors to vote Labour</HEADLINE>

LABOUR leader Tony Blair returns to Perthshire today for the
by-election campaign, in a highly personalised intervention that shows
his party is going for broke to prove it can win the contest.
Mr Blair seems determined to confound critics who say his second visit
of the campaign in support of candidate Douglas Alexander is a high-risk
strategy which will damage him if the voters of Perth and Kinross do not
respond. His walk-about in Crieff this morning will be followed by no
fewer than six shadow cabinet ministers in the next four days.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said last night: ''As a day
visitor I am sure Mr Blair will find Crieff interesting, but he will
have to work very hard to find any Labour vote there.''
Yesterday saw a welter of campaign claim and counter-claim. Tories
were accused of making personal attacks on the doorsteps against SNP
front-runner Roseanna Cunningham.
The Nationalists also claimed that following Conservative candidate
John Godfrey's controversial tactic of urging Tory defectors to give
their protest vote to anyone but the SNP, party workers were now
specifically saying these people should vote Labour. Such a bizarre
endorsement, presumably designed to create the maximum split in the
vote, would carry the risk of pushing the Tories into third place.
It was even suggested by Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy,
supporting candidate Veronica Linklater, that the Tories could come
fourth. He also accused Labour of falling into the classic trap of
believing its own propaganda.
The day began with Home Office Minister Michael Forsyth attacking the
media for the spate of stories suggesting that he wanted the job of
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang. Mr Forsyth has been seen by most observers
as being at the centre of these stories since a return to a Scottish
portfolio would assist his attempts to hang on to his highly marginal
Stirling seat. But he accused the media of engaging in tittle-tattle
which deflected from the Tories' efforts in the by-election campaign.
Even then he was unable to avoid a hint of controversy when he said:
''At the moment Ian Lang is Secretary of State. He has done an
outstanding job and done well.'' The phrase ''at the moment'' was
immediately invested with great significance.
Mr Forsyth, in a high-spirited attack on the SNP candidate, whom he
described as an extreme republican and socialist, gave the kind of
bravura performance which his supporters feel he would bring to the post
at St Andrew's House.
By contrast last night, a speech in Perth by Mr Lang was a very
straighforward statement of the case for the Union which said little
that had not already been put across in recent days.
The SNP theme yesterday was NHS cuts which are reducing the number of
beds for the elderly infirm, and penalising people by taking their homes
and savings if they have to be taken into care. Ms Cunningham described
this as something which was causing profound anxiety and an offence to
the notion of a decent society.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown attacked the SNP in terms very similar
to the criticisms from Conservatives. He referred to ''extreme
anti-monarchist separatism'' which he contrasted with Labour policies
characterised by moderation and common sense. He said that on Rosyth and
the nuclear industry the SNP had to explain what it would do about the
impact of the policies on jobs.

A RESEARCH scientist on a one-day business trip to Glasgow was
repeatedly stabbed on the head and body while he and a friend were
making their way to a restaurant.
As Dr Luigi ''Gino'' Martini, 26, recovered in hospital yesterday, one
of the directors of his company, a pharmaceutical company with worldwide
interests, said he was appalled.
Dr Marry Seager, of the Swindon-based Scherer DDS claimed he was not
aware of any of their 3000 employees worldwide being subjected to such
an attack while carrying out company business.
Dr Martini from Swindon, Wiltshire, and fellow research scientist, Dr
Jonathan Embleton, 29, of Newbury, Berkshire, were attacked on Wednesday
night about 10.20pm by two young men carrying knives, as they made their
way through a car park in the city's Rouken Glen Park towards a Chinese
restaurant.
Detectives say the attack had been ''completely unprovoked''.
Both scientists tried to run away after being confronted, but Mr
Martini, a bachelor, was caught and knocked to the ground where he was
repeatedly stabbed on the head and body. Mr Embleton, also a bachelor,
was not injured but was said to be distressed by the ordeal.
Dr Martini was rushed to the city's Victoria Infirmary where his
condition was initially described as serious although last night he was
''satisfactory''. His parents were on their way to visit him.
The attack on Dr Martini, a pharmacist, and Dr Embleton, a chemist,
occurred less than 800 yards from the Macdonald Thistle Hotel in
Giffnock, where they were staying. They had checked in a few hours
earlier and were on a one-day visit to the city to ''further their
research.''
Dr Seager, director of Scherer DDS, which is part of the US-based RB
Scherer Corporation, said the two men had travelled widely on company
business and ''knew how to keep out of harm's way.''
Speaking from the company's Swindon office he added: : ''Everyone here
is shocked and horrified. We are very distressed and greatly concerned.
It amazes me to think people can do this to others.
''Our business regularly involves many of our employees travelling
throughout Britain and the world to meet academics and companies to
further our research and development.
''As far as I know none of RB Scherer's employees has ever been
attacked in this way before and they regularly visit cities which have
much more violent reputations than Glasgow.''
Dr Seager said the attack had not changed his opinion of Glasgow. ''We
are very fond of it,'' he said. ''We have a company in Clydebank and
regard our Scottish employees very highly. They are dear friends to us.
We all think Glasgow is a great place. It is very sad when when this
sort of thing happens.''
Dr Stephen Jones, a director at the Clydebank headquarters of Scherer
DDS, who visited Dr Martini in hospital yesterday, said: ''He was fine
considering the circumstances and is making a good recovery.''
The director said he had also spoken to Dr Embleton who was ''upset
and distressed'' by the attack.
The man leading the hunt for the two assailants, Detective Sergeant
Campbell Farquharson of Giffnock CID, said the attack had been
''completely unprovoked.''
The attackers had stolen Dr Martini's anorak-style jacket containing
his wallet. The wallet was recovered at the scene although the jacket
was still missing.
Mr Farquharson added: ''This appears to have been an isolated
incident. However, attacks like this do nothing to promote the image of
the city.''
He said the two assailants were both in their early 20s. One was
wearing a dark coloured leather jacket and denims; the other a bright
red jacket.
Anyone with information should telephone 0141 883 0491.

A CALL for the immediate release of former Barings trader Nick Leeson
was turned down by a German court yesterday.
Judges rejected claims by Mr Leeson's lawyers that his continued
detention pending extradition proceedings was ''wrong in law''.
Mr Stephen Pollard, Mr Leeson's English lawyer, insisted that a
forgery charge on which his client is being held was invalid.
The plea for the trader's release on bail was lodged on Monday, citing
inconsistencies in extradition papers submitted by the Singapore
authorities.
Mr Leeson faces four charges of forgery and eight of ''cheating'' in
connection with multi-million pound futures trading in Barings'
Singapore office.
But he is being held on the basis of a specimen charge alleging he
forged the signature of a New York broker in a bid to top up funds to
keep his trading alive as the markets crashed.
Mr Pollard insisted there was no evidence of forgery -- just a
question of a signature being photocopied, with no confirmation that Mr
Leeson was responsible.
Mr Pollard said the charge was not punishable under German law, and
therefore invalid as a basis for extradition, but the judges rejected
the bail application.
Now Mr Leeson, 28, remains in custody in the Frankfurt jail where he
has languished since flying to the city in March following the collapse
of Barings with the loss of hundreds of millions of pounds on futures
trading.
Mr Pollard is still hoping that a British extradition appeal will be
lodged in Germany, giving Mr Leeson the option of returning home to face
a judicial system which, his lawyer claims, is less draconian than the
regime in Singapore.
The Serious Fraud Office has been given copies of the extradition
warrant, with Mr Pollard pointing out parts of the evidence which he
says could amount to a charge of ''false accounting'' in UK law.

YARROW Shipbuilders will have to wait until next week to learn if it
has won a #200m order to build four patrol corvettes for the South
African Navy.
The South African Cabinet is currently reviewing the bids from the
main contenders, Yarrow and the Spanish, state-owned Bazan.
There has been behind-the-scenes pressure from German, Danish and
French shipyards for a new round of tendering.
But a Yarrow spokesman said yesterday it was unlikely that the contest
would be widened. He said: ''There is simply a delay in the
decision-making process in Pretoria. As far as we are aware, only
ourselves and Bazan are in the running.''
Both the Clyde yard and Bazan, based near Cadiz, have offered 100%
deals backed by export credit loans aimed at stimulating the local South
African economy. This ''offset'' investment from either the UK or Spain
would equal the cost of the warship programme.
Among GEC-owned Yarrow's proposals is a scheme to transfer technology
and allow South Africa to build further warships under licence in
future, and a promise to set up a new local company to build
prefabricated houses -- a major issue for President Nelson Mandela in
his struggle to rid South Africa of squatter camps.
Bazan is also offering technology transfer, and a straight loan to
allow construction of fishing vessels in South Africa. Both are offering
home-based naval training packages to SAN personnel.
South Africa's defence budget allows #118m for maritime defence this
year and a further #120m in 1996.
Given its key strategic location guarding the Cape, South Africa is
keen to gain a ''blue water'' navy and replace its existing handful of
ageing diesel-electric submarines and a few Israeli-designed inshore
patrol boats.

AN ELDERLY widow died yesterday when fire swept through her home.
Mrs Helen Brownlee, 78, lived alone in the bungalow in Dunbar Street,
Lossiemouth.
A neighbour raised the alarm early yesterday morning. Mrs Brownlee's
niece, Mrs Sandra Thomson, who lives next door, rushed out to the scene,
where she was joined by other relatives and neighbours.
Nine firefighting appliances attended the scene. Such was the
intensity of the blaze, firefighters were still damping down the embers
seven hours later.
The victim's cousin, Mr Donald Stewart, a retired Strathclyde
University lecturer, said: ''I live near-by but when I got there the
roof had already fallen in. The flames were incredible. No-one could do
anything to save her.''
Mrs Brownlee, who had been awaiting a heart operation, moved back to
her home town 17 years ago when her husband, Willie, died.
The couple had lived in Bishopbriggs, where they regularly attended
Kenmure Kirk.
0 An investigation has been launched to establish the cause of the
blaze.

A MAN was jailed for 18 months yesterday after being found guilty of
illegally selling or holding 22 wild peregrine falcons.
Derek Canning, 33, of Riding Mill, Northumberland, denied six charges
of selling peregrines and another of holding the birds of prey for sale
during 1992-93 at Newcastle Crown Court.
He claimed the birds he sold and others found in a raid on his home in
July 1993 were all produced from licensed captive, adult birds.
DNA tests proved that Canning must have used wild birds to produce the
number of fledglings which passed through his hands.
After the verdicts it was disclosed he had a previous conviction for
similar offences.
The jury had heard how Canning had maps pinpointing at least 10
peregrine eyries in southern Scotland, Northumberland and Cumbria.
The UK peregrine population has, through conservation, increased to
more than 1000 pairs, 25% of the European total.
Mr Guy Shorrocks for the RSPB welcomed the judgment and said that five
of the 16 peregrines taken from Canning during the inquiry would be
returned to the wild.

THE coxswain of Lerwick lifeboat has been awarded one of the RNLI's
highest bravery honours following the rescue of 67 Russian seamen in
appalling weather last year.
Mr Hewitt Clark, 49, was presented with the RNLI's silver medal --
only eight have been awarded in the past 10 years -- by the Duchess of
Kent in London yesterday.
Mr Clark and his crew made 70 trips to the factory ship Pionersk in
the teeth of a gale on October 31 last year.
An official RNLI report said: ''The fact that no lives were lost or
injuries sustained makes it seem easy. But the seamanship, consummate
skill and boat-handling ability of Coxswain Clark was second to none.
''To go in and take a lifeboat where there was absolutely no margin
for error is a skill in itself. To do it in the conditions that
prevailed that night and in total darkness is beyond belief. To do so
over 70 times without loss of life or injury is surely nothing short of
a miracle.''
At the RNLI's annual annual general meeting which preceded the awards'
ceremony, institution chairman Sir Michael Vernon warned of a funding
crisis.
Legacy income, which makes up the largest part of the RNLI's funding,
fell 4% last year and the trend continued into 1995. The lifeboat
service relies entirely on voluntary donations, he added.
The institution also recorded its busiest year, saving the lives of
1624 people and bringing nearly 1000 more ashore.

EDINBURGH District Council is to appeal to the Court of Session over a
sheriff's decision to revoke a licence for a Leith sauna, which a
mother-of-two claimed would be used as a brothel.
Council leader Lesley Hinds said last night the authority had been
''disappointed'' at the ruling over the Gemini Sauna in Iona Street.
''That's one of the reasons why we are appealing, although we are
appealing on a matter of law,'' she said.
But Councillor Hinds stressed the judgment made it clear that
allegations over a ''purported policy'' that they knowingly licensed
saunas which could be used for prostitution had been unfounded and
formed no part of the sheriff's findings.
The council has 28 days to lodge its appeal, although a hearing is not
expected before the end of the year.
Councillor Hinds stressed the judgment applied only to this particular
case and would not affect any other sauna applications which would be
dealt with in the usual way. The case had been dealt with on its
individual merits, she said.
The sauna -- which had been granted a temporary five-month licence,
due to expire next month -- is now expected to go ''into limbo''.
Councillor Hinds admitted there was nothing to stop a further
application in a different name for an entertainments licence.
In ruling the council made a mistake, Sheriff Nigel Thomson said the
authority's licensing sub-committee had ample evidence to show the
Gemini Sauna in Iona Street, Leith, would have been used for
prostitution.
In a written judgment at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, the sheriff said:
''There was, in my view, a mass of material before the committee from
which they could form a view of the applicant's intention.
''The committee was, no doubt, well aware that it would be illegal to
have a brothel in Iona Street,'' wrote the sheriff.
The Edinburgh-based Scottish HIV Action (SHIVA) group warned the
ruling would put the capital's 200 sauna workers at risk.
SHIVA outreach worker Ms Joette Thomas said: ''If the criminal element
comes back into saunas, there will certainly be an increase in women on
the street, which would put more women in danger. They wouldn't have the
security element and the protection of an operation that was above
board.''
Mrs Debra Scanlan, who took the authority to court to appeal their
decision to license the Gemini Sauna -- only yards from her Leith home
-- was yesterday staying tight-lipped about her victory. She was among a
number of objectors who opposed the original sauna application.
Her lawyer, Mr Robert Hayhow, is reported to have said they would
fight any appeal by the council.
A spokesman for the owner of the Gemini Sauna, Mr Ian Haig, said he
was also considering an appeal.
In his written judgment, Sheriff Nigel Thomson ruled the council's
licensing sub-committee had been both wrong in law and unreasonable in
the way it exercised its discretion in granting the licence.
Sheriff Thomson said the original objections to the sauna ''were
rooted in the likelihood of what was described as a 'health studio'
turning out to be a brothel''.
Sheriff Thomson also referred to letters in support of Mr Haig's
application which had been considered by the council. These had
mentioned such matters as reducing kerb-crawling, preventing incidents
of women being accosted in the streets and promoting safe sex.
Although he had the power to send the application back to the
committee, Sheriff Thomson said he had decided to go further and simply
reverse the decision to grant the licence.

THE Greek Army has come to the rescue of the Episcopalian Bishop of
Edinburgh, under fire for his comments about the ''promiscuous gene''
which critics have interpreted as condoning adultery.
Army recruits who volunteered for blood tests on their first day in
the forces in Athens have helped to establish that male sexuality is a
matter of chemistry.
The governing factor is a hormone, rather than a gene, but the
discovery reinforces the Most Rev Richard Holloway's plea for
understanding for people who have ''followed their instincts''.
Dr Christos Mantzoros, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School in
Boston, conducted the tests, accompanied by a questionnaire, on 92 males
aged 18-22, and reports the results today British Medical Journal.
Sexual activity was based on the average weekly number of orgasms over
the previous month (the circumstances were not gone into) and the blood
samples were subjected to a battery of biochemical tests.
The mean weekly number of orgasms was 3.5, on a range of 0 to 11, and
the hormone with most influence on this was dihydrotestosterone, a
metabolite of the male hormone testosterone.
Dr Mantzoros concludes: ''The frequency of orgasms depends not only on
psycho-social factors but on variation of dihydrotestosterone
concentrations within the normal range.''

<TEXT>
COUNCILLORS called last night for urgent talks with an English-based
drugs company which wants to build what has been described as a mock
cathedral with a 70ft tower in the shadow of Stirling Castle.
The call came after Stirling district councillors voted unanimously to
defer the scheme after a last-minute intervention by the Secretary of
State.
Surrey-based Scotia Pharmaceuticals had earlier threatened to drop a
1000 job scheme if the proposal was vetoed.
In a letter faxed to the council's head of planning, Mrs Sheila Terry,
less than 45 minutes before councillors were due to vote, the Scottish
Office environment department said that the Secretary of State wanted to
time to consider ''calling in'' the proposal if it were approved.
Scottish Office planner, Mr John Gillespie told Mrs Terry that Mr Lang
had taken the decision ''in view of the possible effect on the setting
of Stirling Castle''.
A mass of objections to the plan included one from the Scottish
Office's ancient monuments arm, Historic Scotland.
The direction does not commit the Secretary of State to calling in the
application, but reserves his right to intervene. He will have to give
his decision within 28 days.
Moving deferral, council leader Mr Keith Harding said the matter was
too important to be rushed.
He told fellow councillors: ''This council has a good record of caring
about the history and heritage of Stirling, but we are also aware of the
economic potential and we do wish to attract Scotia to Stirling with the
jobs that would come with it.
''We don't want the wrong message to go out from Stirling -- that
we're against development -- but we have to address the concerns of all
the outside bodies and individuals who have written to us.''
Work is almost complete on a new two-storey office building for Scotia
on the prestigious but controversial Castle Business Park.
But Scotia has applied for permission to build a two and three-storey
extension, more than trebling its office space, with a 70ft hexagonal
tower forming a fourth-storey centrepiece.
The most scathing criticism has come from the Royal Fine Art
Commission for Scotland, which alleged the ''tired and inappropriate
concept of repeated mock cathedrals with cruciform plans'' as aspects of
the plan which ''very seriously threatened one of the most important
settings in Scotland''.

In Paris
ALAIN JUPPE, newly-appointed Prime Minister to President Jacques
Chirac, announced his new Government yesterday.
With 39 Ministers and Secretaries of State, it is larger by 10 members
than the outgoing government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and a
scrupulous mix of members of the UDF and Gaullist RPR, which form the
conservative majority in the National Assembly.
The new government rewards the most faithful colleagues and followers
of the newly-elected President, retaining only Francois Bayrou, 43, as
Minister of Education from the previous Cabinet.
Several eminent personalities of the former regime, such as Interior
Minister Charles Pasqua, a political enemy of Mr Juppe, and Budget
Minister Nicholas Sarkozy, both of whom supported Mr Balladur against Mr
Chirac during the election, are unemployed.
With the creation of several new Ministries, including one called
Integration and the Fight Against Exclusion and another termed
Solidarity between the Generations, President Chirac and Mr Juppe are
evidently trying to fulfil election promises to make the struggle
against unemployment and poverty a top priority.
Jacques Toubon, 54, Minister of Culture in the outgoing Government,
was at the Cannes Film Festival yesterday when he learned he had been
appointed Minister of Justice, the second most important job in the
government after Prime Minister. His replacement as Culture Minister is
42-year-old Philippe Douste-Blazy, the mayor of Lourdes and current
Minister for Health.
Alain Madelin, 49, the first senior member of the UDF to come out in
support of President Chirac and noted for his liberal economic views,
was made Minister of Economy and Finance. Herve de Charette, another
Chirac supporter from the UDF, takes over from Mr Juppe as Foreign
Affairs Minister while Jean-Louis Debre, 50, son of General de Gaulle's
Prime Minister Michel Debre, goes to the Ministry of Interior.
Charles Millon, 49, who stood briefly in the presidential election as
candidate for the UDF before rallying President Chirac's camp, is
Defence Minister.
The Ministry of Health goes to 38-year-old Dr Elisabeth Hubert, one of
the few women to hold a senior position in the new government.

Kinshasa, Thursday
HEALTH workers searched the quarantined Zairian city of Kikwit today
for victims of the deadly Ebola virus after the killer bug appeared to
have escaped from medical centres where it was initially isolated.
The World Health Organisation in Geneva announced that experts on the
ground in south-west Zaire had identified 114 cases, of whom 79 had died
-- most of them in Kikwit.
The tropical city with a population of 600,000 remains the epicentre
of the outbreak, which began at a local hospital at the end of March or
early April. However, the search for victims has now widened to
surrounding villages.
Today's WHO figures represented an increase of 13 since the United
Nations body reported yesterday, warning of a further surge over the
coming days.
The Red Cross said three of its Zairean volunteer workers were among
the dead while a fourth was in the last stages of the disease and beyond
medical aid.
A WHO spokesman said despite fears in the Zairean capital Kinshasa, no
cases had been identified there. The increase in reported cases over the
past few days has followed checks by health workers in villages around
Kikwit.
There is no known antidote or cure for the virus, which kills by
causing severe internal bleeding. Infection is passed on by close
contact or by infected blood, which emerges through the skin of victims.
In the US today, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention ordered
all airlines to notify the agency if any passengers headed to the US
were ill with fever or vomiting blood, two Ebola symptoms.
A Zairian man who arrived in Toronto aboard an airliner from Belfast,
was put in 21-day quarantine overnight after telling Canadian officials
his mother died in the area stricken by Ebola.
Meanwhile, a Swiss zoologist who survived the Ebola virus has provided
scientists with the first proven link between human infection and
monkeys, writes Medical Correspondent ALAN MacDERMID.
The 34-year-old woman caught the virus from a dead chimpanzee on which
she had performed a post-mortem examination in the Tai National Park in
Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa, the Lancet reports.
Her illness last November was not connected with the outbreak in
Zaire, and scientists from the Pasteur Institute in Paris say it is a
new strain, bringing the total of Ebola strains to four.
Despite a general assumption that Ebola has jumped species from monkey
to human, this the first time that a human infection has been connected
to naturally-infected monkeys in Africa.

Toronto, Thursday
A MAN accused of kidnapping and killing two schoolgirls went on trial
today in one of the most closely watched cases in Canadian legal
history.
Spectators jammed Toronto's largest courtroom and strained to see
30-year-old Paul Bernardo as he was led in. He wore a dark suit and
appeared relaxed.
Bernardo is charged with killing Leslie Mahaffy, 14, and Kristen
French, 15, both of Ontario. If convicted, he could face up to life in
prison.
Prosecutor Ray Houlahan argued in his opening statement that the
killings were premeditated and took place in connection with confinement
and sexual assault.
He presented a litany of graphic detail, charging that the suspect and
his former wife took the girls in separate incidents to their home,
where they were sexually abused and murdered.
Justice Patrick LeSage gave detailed instructions to the eight men and
four women on the jury. He said they would be presented with a variety
of evidence, including videotapes.
Authorities say the trial will involve dozens of witnesses and stretch
over several months.
Bernardo's former wife, Karla Homolka, 25, will probably be among
those witnesses. She was convicted two years ago of manslaughter in
connection with the deaths and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
Mahaffy vanished in 1991. Her body parts were found encased in
concrete two weeks later. French's abduction a year later raised fears a
serial killer was operating in southern Ontario.
Following Homolka's trial, a judge slapped a ban on publicising key
details of the case in an effort to ensure the jury would be impartial
in Bernardo's trial.
Justice Patrick LeSage must still rule on a key question -- whether

Los Angeles, Thursday
CONVICTED Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss said in an interview published
today that she has rejected a deal offered by prosecutors which would
have put her in prison for less than four years.
Fleiss said she had chosen to fight the case in court instead of
accepting the plea bargain, which would have required her to plead
guilty to federal money laundering and tax evasion.
''I already told them no deal,'' she told the Los Angeles Daily News.
''I don't think it's any deal at all. I'm offended by the offer. It
might as well be a life sentence.''
Fleiss, who is accused of running a high-priced call-girl ring
catering to the Hollywood elite, was scheduled to be sentenced tomorrow
for her conviction last December on three counts of pandering.
She faces from three to nine years in prison for providing undercover
police officers with prostitutes in the state case.
However the separate federal case against her carries an even heavier
penalty.
Fleiss, 29, is charged with laundering the proceeds of her
prostitution business, tax evasion, and conspiracy. If convicted, she
could be sentenced to up to 158 years in prison.
Fleiss contended that she was being unfairly targeted. ''It's like sex
is the worst crime on earth,'' she said.
Last week her father, paediatrician Dr Paul Fleiss, who was also
charged in the federal case, agreed to plead guilty to income tax fraud
in exchange for a lighter sentence.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Thursday
SNIPER barriers went up along Sarajevo's frontlines today after a
three-day onslaught on the Bosnian capital left 15 people dead and
dozens more wounded.
The level of fighting eased today after earlier artillery barrages and
small-arms exchanges described as the worst in 18 months. However, the
killing of civilians continued.
Local media put today's toll at three dead and 12 wounded while United
Nations officials confirmed two dead and nine wounded.
Most devastating was a Serb mortar shell which slammed into a market
place, killing a man and wounding six other people. Two Russian
peacekeepers also stepped on anti-personnel mines in the Serb-held
suburb of Grbavica.
UN spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Gary Coward justified holding off
punitive Nato airstrikes by saying that most fighting had been
''military on military''.
Neither side has made significant gains around the city, the UN said.
However they could be jostling for position amid hints that Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic is preparing to recognise
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Milosevic, instigator of the Serb rebellion that started the Bosnian
war in April 1992, has had talks all week in Belgrade with a top US
envoy about a deal that would suspend punitive trade sanctions on Serbia
if he recognises Bosnia.
That would not halt fighting immediately, but it could be the first
step in a protracted endgame to the wars in former Yugoslavia.
''Shortly, we will see Milosevic convinced to issue a declaration in
which he recognises the territorial integrity and the internationally
recognised borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' said Greek Foreign Minister
Carolos Papoulias after talks with his Austrian counterpart in Vienna.
''One cannot always just demand something from Milosevic, without
wanting to give him something,'' added Papoulias, one of the few Western
officials with good ties to the Serbian leader.
Meanwhile, thousands of Serbs were on the run in north-west Bosnia
today after the army of the Muslim-led government took a town and three
villages just south of the beleaguered government-held town of Bihac.
There were indications the Serbs had evacuated the settlements in
anticipation. UN officials said up to 6000 had fled.
About 155,000 residents in the government-held Bihac enclave were
reported by relief officials to be facing starvation unless its
besiegers lifted their blockade on relief convoys.--AP/Reuter.

PILLS designed to curb any kind of fast growing cancer tumour are
being tested on patients in Britain.
The drug called BB-2516 has been developed by British Biotech of
Oxford. If the first human trials prove successful, the company plans to
try the pills out on many more people.
Patients with cancers of the colon, prostate, ovary, or pancreas have
been taking two pills the size of aspirins twice a day. The company is
hoping the drug will stabilise growths and allow patients to live
reasonably normal lives, according to a report in New Scientist
magazine.
BB-2516 neutralises enzymes that are overproduced by tumours. It is
these that help the cancer to spread and allow invading growths to
establish the blood supply that is vital for further growth.
Blocking the action of the enzymes should prevent the tumours from
starting secondary growths in other organs.
Chief executive of British Biotech, Mr Keith McCullagh, said: ''If you
can take a pill every day for the rest of your life that keeps the
cancer under control, it will transform people's expectations of
cancer.''
However, he warned against raising expectations too high at this
stage, despite claims of encouraging results from experiments on
animals.
''Until we complete these preliminary human trials, we can't say
anything positive,'' he said.

Strasbourg, Thursday
FRENCH President Jacques Chirac, in his first foreign policy act, met
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today and reaffirmed Franco-German
partnership as the heart of European Union.
Chirac said after meeting Kohl for an hour that both ''have an equally
strong will for European construction''.
Both men said there would be no change in Franco-German relations
after Chirac's takeover from Socialist President Francois Mitterrand and
that the partnership would be constantly reinforced.
In a largely symbolic meeting in Strasbourg, home of the European
Parliament near the German border, the two leaders skirted around
possible economic policy differences over unemployment.
Chirac dismissed as ''absurd and unfounded'' reports that he might
suggest a shake-up of the European currency grid.
Kohl said there were some differences of approach but that egoism and
national interest on the part of either Germany or France would be
impossible as long-term solutions.
Using body language to demonstrate harmony, the two conservative
politicians smiled broadly and shook hands several times on the steps of
the ornate 1870 building at the start of the meeting in Strasbourg, home
of the European Parliament.
At a meeting earlier with fellow Christian Democrats at the European
Parliament, Kohl said the new French president was an old friend and he
believed they saw eye-to-eye on the importance of continuing European
integration.
''The most important task is to pursue the process of European
integration. That's the aim of our meeting with Jacques Chirac and I
think I am in agreement with him on this point,'' Kohl said.
He said the priorities of an EU summit which Chirac is to chair in the
French Riviera resort of Cannes at the end of June were ''continuing the
policy of monetary stability'' and studying new possibilities for
co-operation with central and eastern Europe.
Yesterday, Chirac's office had to crush suggestions that he might
propose a shake-up of the European Union's currency grid, perhaps
accepting a weaker franc to help combat unemployment. The rumours drove
the franc down against the Deutschmark.
French and German officials insisted the Franco-German axis would
remain the motor of Europe even though some Chirac backers are cool to
EU integration and a single European currency.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Chirac and his newly
appointed Prime Minister Alain Juppe, until now Kinkel's counterpart,
stood for ''continuity in foreign policy''.
''Changes of government on this or that side of the Rhine have never
resulted in a need to reinvent German-French friendship,'' Kinkel wrote
in the French daily Le Monde, adding that it was more often a chance to
reinvigorate the ties.
Jean-Jacques de Peretti, a close aide to Chirac, dismissed suggestions
that Chirac might depart from a decade-old ''strong franc'' policy, even
though this has often meant high interest rates in France.
''Jacques Chirac has been falsely judged during the whole campaign on
that issue,'' he told RTL radio. ''He is without doubt the man most
focused on the strong franc and on the overall balance (in the
economy).''
Markets fear that Chirac will have problems reconciling his campaign
goals of boosting wages, cutting taxes, and creating jobs with keeping
the franc pegged to the mark and slashing the budget deficit.
He has also signalled a less enthusiastic stance on Europe than his
predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, by suggesting a referendum on EU
reforms.
In another development, Kinkel today announced that he would step down
next month as leader of the small liberal Free Democratic Party, which
has been battered by mounting losses at the polls.
He pledged to stay on as German Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor
in Kohl's centre-right coalition.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Scots targeted by rogue charities. Firms in Border raids to evade new laws</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish public has no adequate legal protection from unscrupulous
English companies who move north of the Border and rip them off by
falsely claiming to be collecting for charity.
At least eight English firms have switched their activities to
Scotland, particularly Glasgow and Edinburgh, because of the lack of a
legal framework in Scotland to control their activities.
Charity bosses believe the companies have moved north because they
would be prosecuted under new English law if they continued their
activities south of the Border.
The companies involved claim they raise money for charity, but pass on
little or none of the money collected.
The worst offenders are companies who run lottery schemes in shopping
malls for what they claim to be charity, publishing firms who claim part
of the money from their magazines go to good causes, and charity card
sellers.
The concern over their activities has come from the Scottish Council
For Voluntary Organisations, the representative body for Scottish
charities, and the Institute of Charity Fund-raising Managers which acts
as the professional body for charity fund-raisers.
Hilary Mounfield, chairwoman of the ICFM, said it was ''appalling''
that Scottish people who donated to charity were not as well protected
by law as those in England.
She said Scottish law should be brought into line with English
legislation on fund-raising, and said that, in the interim, the
institute had been forced to draw up a voluntary self-regulation code
for Scottish charities.
In England and Wales, the 1992 Charities Act imposes strict curbs on
how charities operate. Legislation dealing with fund-raising activities
set out in the Act only came into affect in March of this year. Similar
rules on fund-raising are included in a Government White Paper for
Northern Ireland.
Despite a campaign by the SCVO, similar legislation on fund-raising
was not extended to Scotland, leading to charity bosses introducing
their own code for charities because of growing concern over rogue
fund-raisers and the lack of legal proceedure to deal with them. The
code will only have power over around 1000 of the 20000 charities in
Scotland, but the institute hopes to highlight complaints from the
general public about non-members.
As well as fund-raising problems, the Scottish organisations are
concerned over how big a financial cut professional fund-raising
consultants take when called in by charities to run joint promotions.
Difficulties with fraudulent fund-raisers who collect for general
charitable purposes rather than named charities have also been
expressed.
Scottish Office chiefs believe there are enough safeguards already in
place to keep rogue collectors at bay. They point to the Scottish
Charities Office which investigates charities, local authority rules on
street collection and parts of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions)
(Scotland) Act 1990.
Lucy Pratt, policy analyst of the SCVO, said she did not accept the
Government's argument and said her organisation had made its concerns
over rogue fund-raisers clear.
Mr Stephen Lee, UK director of the ICFM, said he knew that at least
eight English firms had moved north because of the tight new legislation
south of the Border.
Labour's National Heritage spokesman Maria Fyfe said it was a worry
when charity experts were raising concerns over the lack of fund-raising
legislation and legal protection for charity donors.
Mrs Fyfe said: ''It is highly significant that these very respected
charity bodies feel the law is inadequate. I would urge the Government
to take a fresh look at the whole issue.''
Ms Mounfield added: ''Ultimately we hope that legislation will be
introduced in Scotland to supersede the voluntary code of practice. In
the meantime, the new code will go a long way to reassure the public
that when they are asked for money for charity, that it is a legitimate
request.''
Trevor Jones, vice-chairman of the ICFM in Scotland, said that people
giving to charities should not be scared to ask specific questions about
where their money was going.

Washington, Thursday
A SUBURB of San Diego, California, was devastated yesterday when an
unemployed plumber stole a tank and drove down the streets, flattening
and knocking over telephone poles and power lines.
Shawn Nelson, 35, was a trained army tank crew member who had talked
about suicide and had apparently praised last month's Oklahoma City
bombing.
He was fatally shot by police when the tank stuck on a concrete
divider in the centre of highway 163 after a 30-minute joyride.
The tank was a 63-ton M-60, the basic battle tank of the American
army, and Nelson stole it from the National Guard armoury. Guard
officials were too embarrassed to offer any explanation of how he
managed to drive away with such a weapon.
The tank's guns were not loaded: all the damage was done by its sheer
bulk and weight.
After Nelson got into the tank and started it, he escaped from the
Guard compound in the simplest way possible -- by running over the gate.
In scenes reminiscent of a Hollywood action film, police pursued him
down the road, but police cars are not much good at stopping a tank
driving at 45mph. Nelson deliberately ran over at least 25 cars, fire
hydrants, and power and telephone poles.
Witnesses said Nelson, whose head was sticking up through the hatch,
was smiling and laughing as the tank rumbled along.
''He came right for us. He looked out of his tank and he just looked
right at us . . . he was trying to kill us,'' said one tearful woman.
Another resident added: ''The expression on his face was: 'Hey, I'm
having fun'.''
Finally the tank ran over the central divide, and stuck. The driver
rocked it back and forth, attempting to get it free.
Four policemen seized the occasion to jump on top of it. They opened
the hatch with bolt cutters. When the thief refused to come out, they
shot him, and he was reported dead at hospital.
Police said Nelson had served with the US army and trained as a tank
crew member at Fort Knox, Kentucky. He also served with a tank battalion
in Germany.
Nelson had been down on his luck and had been acting strangely, police
added. He was out of work, had financial problems, and recently broke up
with his girlfriend.
Nelson had talked to neighbours and friends about suicide and a week
before the incident told a neighbour he wanted to get hold of a tank,
said police spokesman Captain Tom Hall.
Referring to last month's Oklahoma City bombing that killed 166
people, Hall told a news conference that Nelson had said to a neighbour:
''Oklahoma was good stuff.''
However Hall added that Nelson had made no threats. There was no
indication that he had any links to armed militias or held
anti-government views.
Hall defended Nelson's shooting, saying their job was to protect the
public and they had no other option. ''Municipal police officers are not
equipped to stop a 60-ton tank,'' he added.

WASHINGTON: An American scientist has extracted bacteria from the
bellies of bees embedded for millions of years in tropical amber,
producing new material for attempts to develop powerful new drugs from
ancient organisms. Microbiologist Raul Cano says the bacteria are
''living fossils'' and, although they are 25 to 40 million years old,
may be revived to fight contemporary bacteria, fungi, and perhaps
viruses. However Cano dismisses any thought of a Jurassic Park-style

RUNAWAY banker Ian Lumb, who fled the country with #94,000 from the
branch where he worked, began a two-year jail sentence last night.
Lumb, 38, had told his wife Susan, 33, nothing of the massive debts of
#130,000 that caused his mental breakdown and led to him spending seven
months on the run in France with the stolen money, Bolton Crown Court
heard.
He was on the point of suicide when a call he made from a French hotel
was answered by his elder daughter Jenni, 13, and Mrs Lumb, who told him
they loved him and begged him to come home.
Lumb, of Chestnut Drive, Rawtenstall, Lancashire, who took the money
from a NatWest branch in Bolton, was told by Judge Michael Lever, QC,
that the sentence was the least he could pass on someone who had
breached the trust of their employers and stolen a large sum.
After the case, Lumb's solicitor Mr John Potter said Mrs Lumb was
behind her husband ''one hundred per cent''.
''She is a very, very impressive person,'' he said. ''If anyone can
emerge with credit from a situation like this, it is her. He has her
total support.''
Defence counsel Mr Phillip Curran told the court that the family --
the couple have a second daughter, Nicole, 11 -- were ''closer than
ever'' since Lumb returned home last Christmas.
His debts, after borrowing on up to a dozen different credit cards,
had triggered his breakdown and led to him fleeing the country.
The banker had pleaded guilty to stealing the #94,050 at an earlier
hearing.
Sentencing him after reading psychiatric and medical reports, the
judge told Lumb he took into account the ''extraordinary circumstances''
which led him to flee not only his responsibilities but his entire
lifestyle for a ''nomadic existence'' in France.
The court heard he toured France, visiting places where he and his
family had holidayed. He posted sums of cash and letters back home --
and had now repaid all but #120 of the stolen money. Around #55,000 was
sent back from abroad and he had been given another #25,000 by his
mother-in-law to reimburse the bank.
The judge told Lumb, who had worked for NatWest for 20 years before
they sacked him after his return, that he took account of his guilty
plea, his remorse and the fact that his career was over. He had brought
disgrace on himself and suffering on his family.
He said Lumb's mind must have been in ''turmoil'' during his time in
France and his actions had been illogical.
''However, despite these highly individual features, the fact of the
matter at the end of the day is that the central facts are simple and
stark,'' he said.
''You were an assistant bank manager and you stole nearly #100,000
from your employers. It is a serious case and my duty is to reflect
that.''

<HEADLINE>Loch anglers worried by algae 'thick as green paint'</HEADLINE>

TOXIC algae as thick as green paint in sections has spread from
Soulseat Loch, near Stranraer, to the Piltanton Burn in the first major
algal pollution incident of this kind in flowing water.
Members of the Dunragit Angling Club plan to demand compensation if
fishing on the Piltanton Burn is affected by the algae, which they claim
has now moved seven miles from the source at Soulseat Loch.
Committee member Angus McLean said: ''There was serious pollution in
the Piltanton four or five years ago and it has just recovered. We have
restocked the burn since that time. Fish migrate to this burn and we are
expecting a run of fish at the end of June. If the burn is polluted the
fish will not come in.''
The club faced a considerable financial loss if existing fish were
poisoned and others did not spawn because of the algae, said Mr McLean.
Notices are posted around the Soulseat Loch, which is owned by Stair
Estates, warning anglers and farmers of the potential danger.
Mr Bill Affleck, depute director of environmental health at Wigtown
District Council, said: ''If you drank the water, it could make you very
ill. It could be fatal. It could cause skin or eye irritations and
rashes. Some days it is toxic, some days it is not.''
The algae in this case has been named as oscillatoria, but the loch
has a long history of algal problems, although the recent pollution is
thought to have been exacerbated by the use of phosphates in
agricultural fertilisers and recent mild winters. Monks in Soulseat
Abbey, which dates from the twelfth century, referred to the loch as the
''green stank''. The recent incursion into the Piltanton Burn is being
attributed to strong northerly winds which have blown the algal blooms
across the loch.
Dr Alastair Stephen, fisheries biologist with the West Galloway
Fisheries Trust, said: ''It looks like green paint -- it is incredibly
thick. In a loch like this you would expect to have a lot of plant
growth in it. But there is not because the light is precluded from
getting to the bottom because of the algae.''
One possibility being considered by the Solway River Purification
Board is the use of barley straw which gives off toxins which damage
algal growth, but this would take a number of years to be effective.
''The Stranraer and District Angling Club added a lot of copper
sulphate a few years ago. It kills the algae but causes another severe
problem in that the copper builds up in the sediment and that is toxic
to the plantlife,'' said Dr Stephen.
Soulseat Loch is stocked with rainbow trout and so far there have been
no reports of dead fish, although two cattle are believed to have died
recently and six calves last year after drinking water from the loch.
Mr Stuart Coy, area inspector for the Solway River Purification Board,
who has called a meeting of interested parties today, said: ''We are
talking about a very serious algal problem, probably of largely natural
origin, although there is an anthropogenic element. It is the same as
the Loch Leven problem a few years ago, although a different algae, I
believe.''
He went on:''There is no easy answer. This loch has had an algal
problem going back to medieval times. It is a naturally fertile water
with a very high level of natural phosphates.''

<HEADLINE>MPs angry as #10m pledged to set up new water boards</HEADLINE>

THE Government's decision to allocate almost #10m to the setting up of
three new water boards in Scotland provoked fury from opposition MPs
last night.
SNP leader Alex Salmond described the figure as a ''scandal'' when
compared to the #36m which has been set aside to fund Scotland's 29 new
councils.
The leader of Strathclyde Regional Council, Mr Bob Gould, warned that
the cash could be used to fatten up boards for privatisation at some
point in the future.
The figure of #9.7m was revealed by Scottish Office Local Government
Minister George Kynoch in response to a parliamentary question from Mr
Salmond.
Mr Salmond said later: ''The Tories are throwing money at their pet
project and at the same time starving the new councils of desperately
needed cash.
''While the new boards must think Christmas has come early, Scotland's
new councils have been given a shoestring budget to get themselves off
the ground.
''An average of #1.2m has been given to each of the new councils while
nearly #10m has been given to provide just one service. Yet again the
Tories have got their priorities wrong.
''They are willing to splash out millions removing Scotland's most
precious asset from public control while implementing cuts in local
government funding which have jeopardised vital services the length and
breadth of Scotland.''
Councillor Gould, who will next year become the leader of the new
Glasgow City Council, said Labour had been warning for years that the
Government would pull out all the stops to fund water boards.
''If we asked for that sort of money for a similar thing we would be
told to get lost,'' he said. ''It is clear the Government are trying to
buy their way into the system.
''I believe that privatisation is one of the goals and this may be
their way of making water boards more attractive. If they win the next
election then I have no doubt the boards will be privatised.
''One of the reasons for this unusually large amount of money is to
try and convince people that they would get better value if they went
down a certain road.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said last night that the
allocation was not excessive, adding: ''Comparing the new councils with
water boards is not a valid comparison.
''This money will be used to set up three boards to cover the whole of
the country. There are 29 new councils in Scotland.
''The funding is to allow the setting up of the new authorities that
will include money to get premises, recruit staff and buy equipment.''

THE case of a former clay-pigeon shooting champion who has twice won
large damages awards may have to go back to a jury for a third time.
Last week, a jury at the Court of Session awarded #165,500 to Mr David
Girvan, a five-times Scottish champion, European champion and a
Commonwealth Games bronze-medallist whose sporting career was ended by
an elbow injury.
Mr Girvan, 45, from Glenmoriston in Inverness-shire, raised a #250,000
damages action following an accident near his home in which a van ran
into his Land Rover. He suffered a serious fracture and dislocation of
his right elbow which ended his competitive career as a clay pigeon
shooter.
Out of the total damages, the jury awarded #95,000 for solatium, or
pain and suffering.
Last week's decision followed an earlier jury award of #193,000
(#120,000 for solatium) which went to a second jury after three Appeal
Court judges described the amount as ''wholly extravagant''.
Appeal from the verdict of a civil jury takes the form of a new trial
and Inverness Farmers' Dairy of Lochalsh Road, Inverness, the company
being sued by Mr Girvan, has now lodged another appeal.
The company will argue that although last week's damages award is
lower than the first, it is still too high.
The case has illustrated the wide gap between the attitude of judges
and juries in Scotland over appropriate levels of damages.
The jury's latest award for pain and suffering to Mr Girvan, is only
#20,000 less than the record payout by a judge for a woman paralysed
from the neck down after road accident.
In December last year Lord Penrose made a solatium award of #115,000
to quadriplegic Mrs Elizabeth Martin, who suffered catastrophic injuries
after a lorry ploughed into the back of her parked car. The highest
award by a Scottish judge for pain and suffering for a paraplegic is
believed to be #70,000.
In allowing the first retrial in Mr Girvan's case, Lord Ross, the Lord
Justice Clerk, said it was quite clear that the solatium award of
#120,000 was quite out of line with anything which had been awarded in
the past.
The appeal judges were told that the largest previous Scottish award
for an injury of the type suffered by Mr Girvan was #15,000.
Counsel for Mr Girvan argued that a judge in England might have
awarded about #40,000 for pain and suffering in a case like this and in
Mr Girvan's case it should be higher because of his inability to compete
any longer at the highest level of clay-pigeon shooting.
Reference was also made to huge libel awards in England and the large
pay-outs to pregnant ex-servicewomen.
Unless the two sides can reach agreement on the level of damages,
there is, in theory, no limit to the number of times the case could go
back to a jury.

<HEADLINE>Nurses urge change in law to protect prostitutes</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NURSES have called on the Government to decriminalise prostitution to
protect the health and safety of women and children.
Members of the Royal College of Nursing's annual congress yesterday
voted by an overwhelming majority to instruct their leaders to press for
a change in the law.
The move was prompted by worries that prostitutes and their children
are suffering discrimination.
The vote -- following this week's decision to tear up the college's
no-strike rule -- further shatters the RCN's traditionally moderate
image.
Voting was 381 for, with 55 against, and 44 abstentions -- a 79%
majority.
Under the law as it stands, it is not illegal to be a prostitute, but
it is to solicit, keep a brothel, or live off the earnings of others
selling sex.
RCN delegates were told of evidence that prostitutes are being denied
proper health care, including fertility treatment.
Ms Robbi Robson, assistant director of RCN policy, said all too often
there was a belief that if you were a prostitute you were a bad woman
and bad mother, but this was not true.
However, because of this belief, children of prostitutes were being
taken into care.
Ms Robson said the RCN wanted male and female prostitutes to have
access to non-discriminatory health services.
At the moment, many feared that by going to hospital their names might
be passed on to police. This fear was so great that even women who had
been severely beaten were reluctant to attend hospital.
Mrs Julia Fearon, of the RCN's Society of Paediatric Nursing, said
that decriminalisation would enable regulation of prostition and
licensing of brothels. By licensing brothels, anti-drug policies and
minimum age limits could be introduced.
She said: ''Decriminalisation will not solve the problems of poverty,
but we believe that it would help reduce some of the discrimination
women, men, girls and boys who prostitute, currently face.''
Delegates heard that between 1989 and 1994 there was a 35% increase in
the number of girls under 16 cautioned for soliciting.
Mrs Gayle Trotter, a worker in a Scottish outreach clinic for
prostitutes, said: ''The law is colluding with prostitutes because women
are cautioned, fined, and have to go back on the street to pay the fine.
I see this cycle of entrapment reported every night.''
Mrs Liz Rees, one of the few who spoke against the resolution, warned
that it could lead to more people becoming prosititutes. She claimed
decriminalisation should ''remain the English Collective of Prostitute's
cause, not the RCN's''.

A LABOUR MP has written to the Secretary of State for Scotland, Ian
Lang, urging him to prevent a 14-month-old child at the centre of an
international custody dispute being taken back to Spain.
Ms Catherine Johnston, 25, of Craigendmuir Park, Stepps, is fighting
to keep her daughter Lucia Cortes in Scotland.
Mr Tom Clarke, the MP for Monklands West, said there should be no
attempt to take Lucia to Spain until the matter is raised at Scottish
Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
But the girl's father Mr Jose Cortes is demanding access to Lucia
after Ms Johnston took her from Spain. Mr Cortes has been backed up by a
Court of Session ruling last month that Lucia's removal was unlawful.
Mr Clarke raised the matter at Business Questions in the Commons
yesterday. He asked the Leader of the House, Mr Tony Newton, to allow a
debate on the matter.
Mr Clarke said the well-being of the child -- as laid down in the 1989
Children Act and the Children (Scotland) Bill currently being debated --
would not be ensured if she was taken away from her mother, kept in
custody and put on a plane without any members of her family.
In the letter he said: ''The Leader of the House referred me to
Scottish Questions on Wednesday, May 24, and agreed to bring the matter
to your attention.
''Can I therefore have your assurance that you will ensure no action
is taken by sheriff officers in my constituent's case before then?''
Lord Cullen, sitting at the Court of Session on Wednesday, ruled that
court officers could remove Lucia from the country.
But Mr Clarke said: ''Mr Newton is a fellow Cabinet member of Mr Lang
so it is important that he has made this statement. Mr Lang should deal
with this at Scottish Questions as Mr Newton suggested.''
He said that would give Ms Johnston a respite from the threat of court
officers removing Lucia.
Mr Cortes, 36, speaking from Benidorm, said last night: ''I hope to be
reunited with my little girl in the next few days, possibly as soon as
this weekend -- but I'm not certain.''
He added: ''I want to give my side of this problem. But I've been
'handcuffed' by my lawyers. They have told me not to say anything until
this matter has been resolved.''
But Mr Cortes did make one promise. He said: ''I will obey whatever
decision the courts make. I just want to be close to my daughter
sometimes.''

THE Highlands are poised to win much-needed new jobs with the prospect
of an international bio-medical company building a research and
manufacturing base in Inverness.
The multi-million pound development would be the biggest hi-tech
manufacturing deal ever brought to the North of Scotland.
It would create around 375 jobs over five years as well as substantial
spin-off employment.
However, the firm is working to a tight schedule and any delays caused
by red tape could mean the opportunity being lost.
The deal, now about 95% certain, has been won by development agency
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, working with Locate in Scotland and
Inverness and Nairn Enterprise.
HIE has asked Highland Regional Council to arrange an emergency
planning committee meeting next month in a bid to rush through the
application.
The identity of the company has not been revealed, but it is based
abroad and already has an operation in England. It is understood to be
keen to begin manufacturing in Inverness by the turn of the year.
If successful, the deal will be a major coup for the Highlands which
will have beaten off fierce competition from home and overseas.
A significant factor has been the availability of land next to
Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, the biggest general hospital in the
Highlands.
An HIE spokesman said yesterday the deal remained a ''firm prospect''
and said he was confident the firm's deadlines could be met if the
planning hurdle can be cleared.
''If key procedures including planning permission are cleared quickly,
the requisite construction and other steps to meet deadlines for
commencing production can be met.''
It is believed several dozen office, manufacturing and laboratory jobs
would be created immediately with the figure rising to around 375 within
five years.
The HIE spokesman added the proposal is in line with the local
enterprise company's strategy to develop complementary businesses beside
the specialist facilities at Raigmore.
Only last month a conference in Inverness heard the medical sector was
a potential growth area for the Highlands.
Raigmore Hospital serves an area the size of Belgium and is well
positioned to benefit from spin-off industries.
A Highland Regional Council spokesman confirmed a special meeting of
the planning committee will be held on June 14 to consider the
development.
''The request for an early meeting was granted by senior officials who
recognised the importance of the application and the need to consider it
speedily.''

A WOMAN called for a referendum on capital punishment after her
daughter's killer had been jailed for life, with a recommendation that
he serve at least 15 years.
Mrs Marguerite Adam was speaking after a judge had jailed Edward
Mullen for the murder which shocked a quiet Ayrshire town saying: ''I
consider that at present you are a danger to the public.''
Mullen, 25, of Meadowfoot Road, West Kilbride, admitted the murder of
Mrs Yvette Wilson, 27, on January 19 in a bothy at the town's railway
station.
The High Court at Kilmarnock heard that Mrs Wilson, a waitress at
Inverkip Marina and part-time design student, had been on her way to an
evening out with friends when she was grabbed by Mullen. She was taken
into an outhouse known locally as the bothy, where a scarf was placed
round her neck then stuffed into her mouth, suffocating her. The body
was later burned beyond recongition.
Defence counsel Donald Findlay, QC, said that, following careful
consideration of the evidence and consultation with his client, he was
tendering pleas of guilty to murder and not guilty to two charges of
breach of the peace, one of theft and another of setting fire to Mrs
Wilson's body with intent to defeat the ends of justice. These were
accepted by advocate depute Iain Bonomy, QC, on behalf of the Crown.
Later Mrs Adam expressed her anger and bitterness at the ''mutation''
who had killed her daughter, and as well as calling for the restoration
of capital punishment, was critical of the railway authorities for
de-manning stations like West Kilbride.
She was joined in her criticism of ''lonely, dark railway stations''
by local MP Brian Wilson, who is also demanding an inquiry into why
Mullen was released early from a prison sentence for violent sex
offences and allowed into the community without any supervision.
The court was told by Mr Bonomy that Mullen had moved to West Kilbride
in December 1994 and was unemployed, living in a bedsit near the railway
station. He added: ''The accused was convicted of a number of offences,
including violence, in 1986, then in September 1991, at the High Court
in Glasgow, was convicted of assault and robbery and assault with intent
to ravish and was sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment.''
Mullen was released from Peterhead prison in June 1994 -- having been
given remission -- and lived in Ardrossan, then West Kilbride.
Mr Bonomy described how Mrs Wilson, recently estranged from her
husband, had arranged a night out with friends in Largs on January 19
and was to meet a friend on the train, which she would board at West
Kilbride.
She never made the appointment and, two days later, her purse was
found near the station and her estranged husband reported her missing
after finding that her dogs had not been fed.
Mr Bonomy said: ''That evening, British Transport Police on routine
mobile patrol went into the bothy, which was open . . . they discovered
the body of Yvette Wilson lying on the floor with her knees drawn up and
legs wide apart.''
The advocate depute went on to describe how paper, wood and paint had
been piled on the body and set on fire. ''Her upper torso and head were
incinerated . . . her facial features were burned beyond recognition.''
He said that a copy of the Sun newspaper, opened at Page 3 and showing
the almost nude figure of a young woman, was lying between Mrs Wilson's
legs.
She was finally identified by her jewellery and by DNA testing. A post
mortem examination showed that she had died from asphyxiation and the
burning of the body took place after death.
The court heard that, on the night of the murder, Mullen had left his
flat and later that evening had spent time drinking and playing pool in
a local public house, as well as travelling to Ardrossan to buy
cannabis.
His fingerprints were found on the door of the bothy and those of his
then girlfriend were found on the newspaper fragments. Mr Bonomy
described how Mullen had broken down crying and admitted his involvement
in the murder, saying that he had put the scarf around her mouth and
neck to keep her quiet.
Mr Bonomy said that Mullen had told police of ''urges to harm people,
mainly women'' which he had kept under control, but added that there was
no record of Mullen seeking psychiatric help at Peterhead.
He said that, for some weeks before the killing, Mullen had shown
particular interest in the movements of young women around the station,
but that this was never reported to police. ''With hindsight, that is
perhaps a pity.''
Mr Findlay said that, in all his dealings with Mullen, he had admitted
his part in the killing and that, while offering no explanation, showed
''considerable regret and contrition''.
He added: ''On the subject of the newspaper, I would point out that,
while some people may derive a perverted pleasure from broadcasting
details of this, there was no relevance in the paper, which had been
grabbed from his flat and taken to the bothy. It could have been open at
any page.''
Mr Findlay said that his client had sought psychiatric help in
Peterhead, but there had been no interest shown, and that he had gone to
a GP to tell him that he was having trouble adjusting to life on the
outside.
He added: ''While Mr Mullen has not given me any explanation, he has
expressed his sympathy to the family of the deceased . . . anyone who
thinks it is easy to plead guilty to murder is not living in the real
world . . . he has shown considerable fortitude and courage in taking
this course.''
Mrs Marguerite Adam dismissed the apology and added later: ''They talk
about people getting a second chance. Where is my daughter's second
chance -- resurrection?
''I have always believed in capital punishment and, after this, I have
never been surer. It was not meant as a deterrent but to rid society of
the kind of people who do this.
''I am not talking about things done in the heat of the moment, but
this murder was not like that. Now we will all have to pay to keep this
mutation in prison for 15 years. The time has come for consideration to
be given to the victims and those they leave behind. The do-gooders and
bleeding hearts have had their say, now let the people speak in a
referendum on capital punishment. The results might just surprise
everyone.''
Mrs Adam accused ScotRail of ''penny pinching'' in the de-manning of
stations and it was backed by Brian Wilson MP, who said: ''It is just
crazy that these stations are being turned into dark, lonely places
where people are not safe. For months before this tragic case, ScotRail
and Railtrack were arguing over who was responsible for the lighting.''
He is also to press the Lord Advocate for an inquiry into why Mullen
was released early and not given any supervision, despite ''the nature
of his offences and his obvious predilection for behaviour like this.''
A spokesman for ScotRail said: ''We have every sympathy for Mrs Adam
and her family and are gratified that the court case has ended in a
conviction.
''Throughout Scotland there are 332 railway stations, of which 146 are
manned. ScotRail does not believe it would be feasible to man the other
186. ScotRail puts considerable emphasis on safety in stations and
co-operates in this field with British Transport Police. Good lighting
and the increased use of closed circuit television have resulted in a
good general standard of safety in Scottish stations.''
Mrs Adam praised Strathclyde Police, on whose behalf Superintendent
Louis Munn said: ''This was a brutal murder which was particularly
harrowing for everyone in the inquiry team.
''The response from a community shocked by this crime was excellent
and the police and local people worked closely together. It is a tribute
to the dedication and professionalism of every officer, in particular
members of the forensic team, that this inquiry reached such a speedy
conclusion.''

FITNESS centres that offer the use of sunbeds may be putting health
enthusiasts at risk of skin cancer, doctors warned yesterday.
Consultant dermatologist Dr Margaret Price revealed she now sees
around 50 cases of skin cancer each year and the numbers are rising.
''Many gyms and fitness centres where you can go for step aerobics
also advertise sunbeds. It is giving people a double message that they
are healthy,'' she said.
''We are now seeing about one case a week of the most dangerous type
of skin cancer, malignant melanoma,'' said Dr Price, who practises in
Brighton.
Health Education Authority research showed young people, mainly women
in the 16-24 age group, were the biggest sunbed fans. Almost one in four
spends longer than the recommended two courses of 10 sessions per year
on UVA sunbeds.
The alert about overuse of sunbeds is disclosed in the British Medical
Journal. The problem revealed by the HEA survey on attitudes is that
most adults and children interviewed felt sunshine in Britain posed
little risk.
Sunbeds are designed to produce a tan by giving off UVA radiation,
which was thought until recently to be a safe form of radiation, with
the tan produced by a sunbed a safe tan.
But now it is known this is not the case. UVA ages the skin
prematurely and contributes to potentially fatal cancers.
Ms Katie Aston, manager of the Health Education Authority's skin
cancer campaign said: ''In light of this new research, the public needs
more information about the risks of using sunbeds.
''We would hope very much that the manufacturers will take this
opportunity to consult with medical and other health professionals to
ensure that sunbed users have the most accurate information available
when deciding whether or not to have a sunbed session.''
The HEA recommends that some people should never use sunbeds. These
include the under 16s, people who burn easily or tan poorly, people
using drugs or cosmetics known to be photo-sensitising or people who
have had skin cancer.
The results show:
* Serious attempts to tan seem to start from the teenage years
onwards.
* Younger children aged eight to 12 liked their appearance when
tanned, but found it boring and uncomfortable to lie in the sun for a
long time.
* Most people, particularly teenagers, believed they look sexier and
feel better with a tan.
* Large expanses of white skin are associated with ill-health and a
general lack of vitality.

THE official report into the RAF Chinook helicopter crash which killed
top counter-terrorism experts will not be published before a memorial
service for the victims.
While RAF chiefs agree that it would have been ''insensitive'' to make
public the report -- expected to blame pilot error for the horrific
accident -- before the service, a spokesman said yesterday it had not
yet been completed.
The elite of Britain's intelligence community and relatives of the
dead will gather in private for a service at the Army barracks chapel at
Lisburn in Northern Ireland on June 1.
Relatives will then be flown to the Mull of Kintyre for a solemn
pilgrimage to the small cairn of stones marking the spot where the
helicopter crashed on June 2 last year.
Twenty-five of the principal strategists in Britain's fight against
terrorism were killed, along with the four crew on the flight from
Northern Ireland to Scotland.
The long-awaited RAF Board of Inquiry report has been complicated by
two primary factors -- there was no ''black box'' flight recorder and
no-one survived to provide an eyewitness account.
The sensitive reportis understood to focus on why the pilot was flying
so low when approaching a mountainous area.
Conditions were difficult and experts were immediately baffled as to
why the pilot had not approached the coast at a safe altitude.
It is believed the report will explain that the helicopter crew had
lost their bearings and were not flying where they thought they were.

THE girlfriend of a teenager who hanged himself in a police cell
yesterday won #750 damages for their baby son.
Miss Mary Stewart had claimed #15,000 from the Chief Constable of Fife
over the death of Mr Colin Davidson for the child she was pregnant with
when he died. The boy is now five-years-old.
Miss Stewart, of Green Street, Dunfermline, in Fife, had also sought
#20,000 damages for herself, but a civil jury at the Court of Session
made her no award.
The 12-strong jury decided that the proportion of blame for the death
of Mr Davidson, 19, in police custody at Dunfermline Police Station in
April 1989 lay 95% with the youth himself.
The mother of the dead teenager, Mrs Helen Davidson, 57, of Wedderburn
Crescent, in Dunfermline was awarded #500 damages. She had claimed
#10,000.
The family had claimed that Mr Davidson should have been treated as a
suicide risk when he was taken into police custody on charges involving
the assault of a 73-year-old woman.
Fife police disputed the action, before Lord Hamilton, and alleged the
youth died because of his own voluntary conduct.

FROZEN foods chain Iceland, yesterday announced major expansion plans
which could mean the creation of up to 500 jobs in Scotland over the
next five years.
Company chairman Mr Malcolm Walker told shareholders that he expected
to open more than 50 stores in the UK every year for the foreseeable
future, doubling its number of shops and adding 5000 staff.
However, the bullish forecast from Iceland was undermined by
yesterday's announcement that one of Britain's long-established life
assurance companies, London Life, is cutting 460 jobs and is no longer
seeking new business.
Most observers will regard the mixed news as symptomatic of the UK
economy: many of the Iceland jobs will be part-time and relatively
unskilled, while the downgrading of London Life, founded almost two
centuries ago, is another example of severe pruning in the financial
sector.
The Bristol-based company's Scottish regional headquarters in Glasgow
is to close, with the loss of nine jobs. Staff have been offered a
number of options, including voluntary redundancy and transfer to sister
firms.
London Life policy-holders have been assured that their investments
are ''absolutely safe''. All existing contractual rights would continue
to be met in full, said a spokeswoman.
Meanwhile, at Iceland's annual meeting in Wales, Mr Walker said the
chain had opened 20 new shops already this year, and expected to reach a
total of 55 by the end of 1995, including about eight more in Scotland.
''Our planned growth will create an additional 1000 jobs this year,
and more than 5000 by the end of the century. This will include the
creation of around 60 store management positions each year.''
Iceland trades from 723 stores, including about 60 in Scotland, but
has identified a further 800 potential sites where it hopes to tap
consumer demand.
It already employs 17,000 staff, and boasts three million regular
customers. Last year, with a turnover of #1300m, it had an operating
profit of #74m.
Yesterday's announcement was the latest chapter in the success story
of Malcolm Walker, who launched his first store in 1970 in Oswestry,
Shropshire. The company took over the rival Bejam chain in 1989, and has
been expanding ever since.
The annual meeting was told that Iceland proposed a 25% increase in
dividends for 1995.

THREE men, likened to Citizen Smith radicals after trying to put their
housing scheme on the map with a petrol-bomb attack on a kebab shop,
were remanded in custody yesterday.
The High Court in Edinburgh was told that an outbreak of civil unrest
had led to improved facilities in another part of town and the men
believed that by damaging property they could achieve similar benefits
for their own area.
David Graham, 23, of Muirhouse Drive, Edinburgh, admitted that between
August 12 and 14 last year he assembled incendiary devices with intent
to cause an explosion.
John Gilmour, 20, and Kevin Williamson, 18, also of Muirhouse Drive,
admitted that on August 13 they petrol-bombed a shop in Pennywell Court,
Edinburgh, endangering the lives of two workers there and damaging the
premises.
Mr Paul McBride, Advocate-depute, told the court that on the afternoon
of August 13 Graham had 10 petrol bombs at his home and discussed with a
number of others the possibility of a riot to ''put Muirhouse on the
map'' and ''give Muirhouse a name''.
Later that night, Gilmour and Williamson left the house, each with a
petrol bomb, and made their way to the kebab shop.
Gilmour walked in and threw his bottle at the wall. The bottle
exploded and the counter caught fire. Williamson was outside at the back
of the shop throwing his bottle at the wall.
The two workers, Shamim Saeed and Mohammed Gouse, fled. They were not
injured, but the shop suffered #24,000 damage.
Mr McBride emphasised that there was no suggestion of any racial
motive for the attack on the shop.
Mr Gary Allan, defending Graham, said the discussion at his client's
house had been about the Muirhouse area lacking many of the facilities
which had recently been provided in Pilton after some civil unrest. It
appeared to the group that the civil unrest had prompted action by the
authorities.
''Graham had the misguided belief that that by causing some signficant
damage to property, the authorities would in some way be compelled to
spend money refurbishing Muirhouse,'' he said.
Lord Johnston asked whether it was some kind of revolutionary
activity, but Mr Allan said that was a somewhat dramatic description.
''One is put in mind more of the television programme Citizen Smith
about a misguided radical whose attempts at achieving anything were
somewhat pathetic. The tragedy of this matter is that Graham took some
overt steps to do something about it.''
He added that the intention was to damage property, not endanger life.
Lord Johnston remanded all three in custody until June 2 for
background reports.

<HEADLINE>Pledge on Scottish HQ as purchase makes Britain's biggest brewer. S&amp;N to take Courage in #425m deal</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle is set to become Britain's biggest brewer, with
the purchase of Courage for #425m to form Scottish Courage as its beer
division.
Once the smallest of the Big Six brewers, S&amp;N will now have annual
beer sales of more than #2200m and have a market share appreciably
higher than that of the long time industry leader, Bass, which owns the
Tennent's and Carling brands.
Shareholders are being asked to put up #354m.
S&amp;N is buying Courage, Britain's second biggest brewer, from Foster's
Brewing Group of Australia to realise a dream that began as long ago as
1968, when S&amp;N and Courage had exploratory talks about the possibilities
of a merger.
The main assets being acquired include six breweries, the Foster's
brands for Britain and Europe and also the Courage names.
Chief executive Mr Brian Stewart said yesterday that there were a lot
of synergy benefits in putting the two companies together and that they
were complementary.
The deal has to be approved by regulatory authorities, including the
Office of Fair Trading, with completion expected in July.
Mr Stewart said that there would be rationalisation, but he could not
give the numbers involved at present.
He added that, although attention naturally focuses on the brewing
side, about 75% of employees are involved in the packaging, warehousing
and distribution activities.
Altogether, the two companies employ 9500 in brewing, with S&amp;N having
4500 and Courage 5000 workers.
It is possible that just over 1000 jobs could be lost.
The risk to employment in Scotland appears to be minimal, with the
cost-cutting and reorganisation expected to generate #40m of savings
annually from 1997.
S&amp;N has five breweries -- at Edinburgh, Newcastle, Marsham -- which
makes Theakston's -- Manchester and Nottingham.
The Courage breweries are situated in Bristol, Cork (Beamish stout),
Reading, Tadcaster and Halifax as well as a half-interest in the
Mortlake brewery on the Thames where Budweiser is brewed under licence
from Anheuser Busch.
Any brewery closures would seem likely to involve Courage at Halifax,
which has been at risk for some time, and S&amp;N's Home Brewery in
Nottingham.
The geographic areas of overlap are mostly in Yorkshire and to some
extent the north-east of England, where there will be reductions on the
distribution side.
Mr Stewart emphasised that, while Scottish Courage would maintain a
''significant presence'' in the south of England, it would be ''firmly
headquartered in Edinburgh -- unlike Guinness''.
He added: ''I don't want to see Scottishness eroded, nor see the
Courage identity lost.''
Courage has had a complicated career since it ceased to be a
family-controlled company. It was taken over by Imperial Tobacco in
1971, which in turn was acquired by Hanson.
Lord Hanson sold it to Foster's, which then split the company up in a
deal with Grand Metropolitan, whereby Foster's took the breweries and
the pubs were put into a jointly-owned company named Inntrepreneurial
Estates Limited.
In 1988 and 1989 Foster's tried to take over S&amp;N, but was thwarted by
the Monopolies Commission.
The reasoning behind the Courage deal is that both companies are
particularly strong in brands, with S&amp;B contributing McEwans,
Theakston's, Beck's and Coors while Courage brings in Miller,
Kronenbourg, Holsten and the omnipresent Foster's as well as Webster's
Yorkshire Bitter.
Brand strength is important, with both brewers seeing increases in
volume at present in contrast to the industry's overall decline --
Courage claims 3% gain.
Measured by consumption, Scottish Courage will have a 25% ''share of
throat'' -- the new term for beer market share which compares with
around 19% for Bass.
However, the Office of Fair Trading may be more interested in the more
traditional measurement of beer production where S&amp;N's 13% has to be
added to the 18% of Courage to make 31% and with the OFT unhappy about
any merger which results in more than 25% market control.
When Fosters was bidding for S&amp;N, the defence was that any takeover
would limit consumer choice as well as lose 3000 jobs.
Yesterday, Mr Stewart said that times had changed and that the beer
market had opened up as a result of the Beer Orders which limited the
number of pubs the big brewers could own.
In addition, competition from imports through Calais now amounted to
5% of the UK market.
TheCampaign for Real Ale (Camra) has demanded an immediate reference
to the Monopolies Commission. Campaigns manager Mr Steve Cox said:
''This merger is grossly anti-competitive. It will give one brewer up to
one-third of the UK market.''
S&amp;N's Mr Stewart claimed that the acquisition of the Courage business
offers a unique opportunity to achieve many strategic initiatives at a
single step and will provide a strong base for growth in the UK and
continental Europe.
The brand owners, including Anheuser Busch, have all agreed to stay
with the enlarged company. There had been speculation that some would be
unhappy about the conflict of interest between certain lager brands.

A FOOTBALLER was ordered to serve a 90-day jail sentence yesterday for
an attack on a referee. He has also been banned from playing the game
for 50 years.
Richard Anderson, 26, of Clunie Road, Dunfermline, Fife, admitted
assaulting a referee during a Sunday match. His lawyers challenged the
sentence at the Justiciary Appeal Court in Edinburgh yesterday claiming
that the sentence imposed on the player was excessive.
They had claimed that the sentencing sheriff ''failed to take account
of the fact that this incident happened during the course of a football
game and as a result the accused was banned from playing football for 50
years''.
Anderson admitted assaulting referee Mr Andrew Watson at a pitch at
Launcherhead Road, Lochgelly, in Fife, by kicking him on the legs on
September 25 last year, when he earlier appeared at Dunfermline Sheriff
Court.
He was sentenced to 90 days' imprisonment, but was released on bail
pending his appeal against the sentence yesterday.
Three appeal judges heard that the referee in the Sunday league
fixture noticed that several players, who were under the influence of
alcohol, were involved in dangerous tackles.
He decided to abandon the fixture after only 16 minutes, but Anderson
''took umbrage'' at this, Sheriff John Forbes said in a report.
The referee was about to show Anderson a red card, but as the match
official turned his back Anderson kicked him on the back of his legs.
Anderson's counsel, Miss Margaret Scott, told the court that it was
clear during the game that her client's team had been in the pub before
kick-off.
She stressed that the referee did not need medical attention. Lord
Allanbridge, who chaired the appeal court bench, pointed out that
Anderson had eight previous convictions for assault, which included a
six-month jail sentence in 1992.
The judges said they were satisfied in the circumstances of the case
that the jail sentence imposed was appropriate.
The team Anderson was playing for was disbanded shortly after the
incident, writes Alan Hunter.
The incident took place durings a Sunday Welfare League match when he
was playing for Dunfermline's Glen Gates FC against Lochgelly Minto,
another local pub team, at Lochgelly's Launcherhead Park.
The decision on the referee's report, submitted to the executive
committee of Dunfermline Welfare League, was later sent to the Scottish
Sunday Welfare Football Association, which ratified the ban.
Lochgelly Minto's secretary, Mr Walter Moodie, added yesterday: ''It
was the first time we had played them, and you could say it was quite a
match.
''I learned later that the other club folded because they could not
get players, although some are playing with other clubs in the league.
''It is hardly likely that the player would want to play football
again in his seventies.''

THE Prime Minister has authorised a meeting between his Northern
Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in
Washington next Wednesday.
It will be the first publicly acknowledged meeting for 70 years
between a Cabinet Minister and Sinn Fein.
Ulster Unionist leader Jim Molyneaux and Mr John Hume of the SDLP were
informed of this decision when they left a joint meeting with the Prime
Minister in his office at the Commons yesterday -- a meeting which in
itself was historic. It is the first time in 25 years that the Ulster
Unionists and the SDLP have co-operated in this way.
Sir Patrick, announcing that he intends to ask Mr Adams to meet him in
Washington on Wednesday when the two of them are attending an investment
conference for Northern Ireland, said he is asking Mr Adams to meet him
''informally'' as early as possible at the conference.
Twenty-four hours earlier No. 10 was saying only that they might bump
into each other at the conference. The meeting has now been upgraded in
a significant way to give a boost to the peace process.
Sir Patrick explained the purpose of his request for a meeting with Mr
Adams at the conference which President Bill Clinton will also attend:
''Economic progress for Northern Ireland, including especially inward
investment, depends crucially on the permanence of peace and on people's
confidence that peace is truly permanent.
''My purpose will be to explain this and to say that public confidence
in the permanence of peace requires, among other important matters,
substantial progress on the decommissioning of arms held by paramilitary
organisations who have declared that violence is at an end.
''I shall make clear again that substantive political talks with Sinn
Fein will only be possible when there is a satisfactory outcome to
exploratory dialogue, including the progress on decommissioning which we
have already publicly stated to be necessary. I shall look to Mr Adams
to respond positively to this.''
This puts the peace process ball back in the hands of Mr Adams who has
been demanding a meeting with the Northern Ireland Secretary in parallel
with talks being held by Mr Michael Ancram, the negotiating Minister,
and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness.
The joint meeting of Mr Molyneaux and Mr Hume with Mr Major in the
Commons last night dealt with social and economic matters in Northern
Ireland and the presentation to be put in Washington next week to
encourage American inward investment.
Both sides emerged pleased with the meeting which confirmed that
electricity prices in Northern Ireland will receive sympathetic
treatment and that water privatisation will not take place there ''in
the lifetime of this parliament''.
The Ulster Unionists and the SDLP were surprised to be told on their
way out from the Prime Minister's office in the Commons about the
intention to conduct a meeting with Mr Adams next week.
The Unionists have been privately reconciled to a meeting between Mr
Adams and the Secretary of State for some time, despite their worries
that Sinn Fein will be allowed into political negotiations without
having handed over any weapons.
But the meeting was condemned by Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast,
the Rev Martin Smyth.
He said that by giving the impression he would not talk to Sinn Fein
until the IRA had begun giving up its weapons, Sir Patrick was left
looking weak and untrustworthy now he had agreed to meet Mr Adams.
Mr Molyneaux was last night reported to be considering pulling out of
the US conference because of Sir Patrick's decision to meet Mr Adams.
Mr Molyneaux said: ''It looks as if this was Washington-driven, the
whole story broke in Washington first.
Pressure was put on Sir Patrick and ''he had very little option --
that is not to say I agree with the decision'', he added.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
said: ''This despicable Government has no principles, no bottom line and
no conception of the outrage and anger within the Unionist community
arising from their serial betrayals.''
''The IRA maintains their firepower, they keep their bloody murder
gangs in place and this excuse for a Government Minister prostrates
himself before their front man.''
Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Tory back bench Northern Ireland
committee, welcomed the meeting.
He insisted it would not detract from the process of exploratory
dialogue with Sinn Fein followed by substantive talks.

THE West Highland Line is to suffer cuts over and above the threatened
loss of the Fort William-London sleeper service, it was revealed last
night.
ScotRail confirmed that it is axing Glasgow-Oban and Glasgow-Fort
William special summer trains that have run for the past three years.
Their withdrawal in July and August was immediately interpreted by
critics as yet another threat to the line's long-term survival.
Additional summer services between Inverness, Thurso and Wick and
Inverness and Wick are also being withdrawn.
Highland Regional Council convener Duncan McPherson warned any
reduction in rail services in the area would be opposed.
The special West Highland Line trains left Glasgow Queen Street at
9.50am, ran to Oban on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to Fort
William and Mallaig on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
Now summer visitors will have no choice but to use the ''normal
service'' -- the 8.12am to Fort William/Mallaig or the 8.42am to Oban.
The summer service withdrawal was confirmed with the publication of
ScotRail's summer timetable, which runs from May 28 to September 23. A
spokesman blamed the axe on ''disappointing loadings''.
A spokesman for the Scottish Tourist Board described the loss as
disappointing, and added that talks would be sought with ScotRail
management for a stay of execution.
He went on: ''Since the threat to sleepers, a number of people and
organisations have been looking at how West Highland services could be
better marketed and promoted.
''Our view is that people must use it or lose it. But to win
customers, ScotRail must market the line better. We need a breathing
space to see how it can be promoted.''
ScotRail also confirmed it is to stop using locomotive-hauled trains
because of ''financial constraints''. That means the old-fashioned
engines will be replaced with Sprinters on the West Highland Line and
between Inverness and Kyle of Lochalsh, and that Edinburgh-Inverness
summer locos will also be lost.
It would appear the battle to meet Government demands for 5% cuts in
the budget up to privatisation is on in earnest. Withdrawing special
trains will achieve savings, but not incur the wrath of the Office of
Passenger Rail Franchising, which set minimum levels of service for the
ScotRail network earlier this week.
Opraf insists its passenger service requirement -- which must be
adopted by the train operator -- will ''safeguard all current routes,
stations, and services'' over a seven-year period.
However, the new timetable included several other surprises, which
left ScotRail in a muddle in one case.
The document includes two midnight ''ghost trains'' to run over a
short stretch of track in Glasgow, allegedly being introduced to avoid
proper public consultation over the withdrawal of Fort William-London
sleepers.
Last night, Strathclyde Regional Council signalled there will be a
pre-emptive strike to ensure the 23.59 Maryhill-Bishopbriggs and 23.49
Cumbernauld-Glasgow trains never run.
The warning of legal action coincided with an embarrassing blunder in
the timetable over the controversial demise of all seated accommodation
on Anglo-Scottish sleepers from May 28.
ScotRail's response is that travellers can no longer look up the
timetable and regard the contents as sacrosanct.
The ''ghost trains'' are scheduled in the Great Britain Passenger
Railway Timetable, despite critical findings by Lord Kirkwood in the
Court of Session earlier this month.
He ruled they would be of no benefit to the travelling public; are
unlikely to carry any passengers, and are meant to circumvent public
consultation procedures.
A ScotRail spokesman was adamant the late-night trains will be
introduced from Monday, May 29. He stressed: ''We are obliged to run
what is in the timetable.''
However, the timetable also states overnight London-Edinburgh and
London-Inverness trains will be ''sleeping accommodation only''. No such
proviso is attached to London-Glasgow or London-Aberdeen overnight
services.
Silence greeted the question: ''Does that mean there will be seated
carriages on the Glasgow and Aberdeen trains -- after all, you are on
record saying that ScotRail is obliged 'to run what is in the
timetable?'''
A spokesman later described the failure to declare all overnight
trains as sleepers-only as ''an omission, a simple error,'' and added:
''There will definitely not be seated accommodation on any of the
sleepers from May 28.''
The timetable excludes the Fort William sleeper, although reprieved
after Lord Kirkwood granted an interdict to Highland Regional Council
preventing its withdrawal on May 28. BR has lodged an appeal, to be
heard on June 1.
The document also confirms the axing of all Motorail services and the
Glasgow-Plymouth and Carlisle-London sleepers because subsidies were
withdrawn by Opraf.

THE Government appeared to sideline the recommendations of the Nolan
Committee into standards in public life yesterday.
The move followed angry reaction by senior Conservatives after Public
Services Minister David Hunt promised ''early action'' on Nolan
Committee recommendations governing the behaviour of MPs.
After a heated debate, leader of the Commons Tony Newton appeared to
soothe some Tory back benchers' fears by proposing a committee of senior
MPs to decide how best to implement proposed reforms over politicians'
conduct.
Winding up last night's debate, Mr Newton suggested that the
appropriate course was to ask ''senior and respected'' MPs to make
recommendations about how to proceed in the light of the Nolan report.
They would put forward specific proposals which might then be put to
MPs, he said, insisting this would be consistent with the House's normal
practice.
His comments came after senior Tories, led by former Prime Minister
Sir Edward Heath, lined up to warn the Government against taking ''panic
responses''.
But his comments, welcomed by Tories critical of Nolan recommendations
affecting their outside earnings, were seized on by the Opposition as
evidence of a cave-in.
Labour accused the Government of putting greed before the interests of
Parliament.
Earlier Mr David Hunt had told the Commons that some of the Nolan
recommendations would be implemented, but others would have to wait for
review.
His comments were reflected in angry Question Time exchanges between
the Prime Minister and Labour leader Tony Blair.
Mr Newton said the House needed a ''proper mechanism'' in place before
decisions could be taken, and that he had been encouraged by various
aspects of the debate which had signalled possible ways forward.
He said ''the devil was in the detail'' and then questioned whether an
existing committee or one established for the purpose of closer
examination would be the right course.
Mr Newton concluded: ''The latter would probably be preferable, not
least for the reason that the existing committees - the Privileges
Committee and the Members Interests Committee -- already have other work
on their plate the House would not like to see pushed aside.''
Mr Blair said the Prime Minister already had accepted the broad thrust
of the Nolan report. He questioned, however, whether the Prime Minister
accepted the recommendation that MPs with consultancies should disclose
the terms of their agreements and earnings
The Prime Minister made clear that the Government wanted to hear the
views of MPs and take them into account before reaching a conclusion. Mr
Blair responded that it sounded as if the Government might reject parts
of Nolan.
In the Commons debate on the report, Mr Hunt reflected the cautious
line. He said, for example, that the Government intended to implement
Lord Nolan's recommendation that proposals by former Ministers to take
up appointments after they leave public office should be brought within
the scope of an advisory committee on business appointments.
Mr Hunt told the House: ''Integrity must remain our watchword. We all
share the responsibility, in this House and elsewhere, for reinforcing
the public's confidence in public service.
''The Government will do everything necessary to ensure that the
quality of the British public service remains, and is clearly seen to
be, the best in the world.''
For Labour, front bench spokesman Mrs Ann Taylor said: ''No-one could,
should and I hope would condone a blanket condemnation of all MPs. It is
simply not the case that all MPs behave as badly as the few who have
brought this House into disrepute. But to imply there is no real problem
does our reputation no good whatsoever.''
