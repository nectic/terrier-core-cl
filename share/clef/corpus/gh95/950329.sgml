New Dehli, Tuesday,
PRIME Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's Government imposed federal rule in
the eastern state of Bihar today and dismissed its chief minister.
The announcement came as voters finished electing a new legislative
assembly and one day before counting starts.
The imposition of direct rule gives the state governor, who is
appointed by New Delhi, wide powers. The decision came after Rao met
with his cabinet ministers.
Many Congress Party leaders had demanded federal rule in Bihar so that
the state's socialist chief minister, Laloo Prasad Yadav, did not have
the power to tamper with counting of votes that begins later today.
Yadav is popular among Bihar's many lower castes because he has
promised to deepen the state's ''affirmative action'' policies, but his
critics accuse him of misusing power to rig elections and promoting
tensions between upper and lower castes.
Bihar being placed under President's rule is a stop-gap step. The
Government's five-year term expired before elections could be completed,
because voting had to be repeatedly put off because of violence.
Eight people were killed in the last round of voting on Saturday
despite the heavy deployment of armed policemen to prevent clashes
between rival political factions and private armies controlled by
politicians. More than 60 people have been killed since campaigning
began last month.
Bihar was scheduled to vote for a new legislative assembly along with
five other states in February and early this month. The governing
Congress Party lost two of the politically most important states --
Maharashtra and Gujarat -- but managed to win in Manipur, Arunachal
Pradesh, and Orissa. Results from Bihar are not expected until later
this week.--AP

GLASGOW'S newest restaurant is 14 years old. The Brasserie Metro and
Deli in the heart of the West End is the successor to the highly popular
Underground Gallery, first opened by Helen Cadenhead in 1981.
And what better time than the centenary year of the Franco Scottish
Association and the 700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance to bring an
authentic touch of Paris Cafe Society and brasserie bar ambience to the
city?
The Underground Gallery, or Gallery Coffee Shop to give it its proper
name, was an institution and provided a comfortable and much-loved
meeting place for a wide cross-section of west enders, and even south
siders such was its reputation. However, as end of lease drew closer,
and with no commitment to renewal, alternative premises had to be found.
The former post office sorting office and latterly auction sales room
immediately adjacent, at 8 Cresswell Lane, directly behind Woolworth's
Byres Road store and only two minutes from Hillhead Underground station,
provided the perfect answer.
After extensive renovations the Brasserie Metro and Deli opened just
before Christmas and is proving a huge success with new and existing
customers.
''When we moved in here we wanted some continuity,'' said Helen's
husband Eric, the architect responsible for the project, ''and at the
same time, being francophiles, we wanted a Parisian theme and to let
people know the restaurant was licensed. After a lot of brainstorming we
came up with 'Metro', the Parisian name for the Underground, and
'brasserie', to let people know it has a full public house licence. And
like brasseries in Paris we provide food all day, with coffee and
drinks.''
Opening times are from 8am till 6pm Monday to Saturday and 9am till
6pm Sundays. However, this is the subject of an appeal to the Secretary
of State for Scotland, to extend the opening hours to midnight.
In fact the project consists of a licensed restaurant, a delicatessen,
and two separate shop units occupied by Beauty Base (hairdresser/beauty
therapist), and Mumbo Jumbo, the Indonesian/Malaysian crafts shop which
shared the former Underground Gallery.
The Brasserie Metro restaurant, on two levels in the art nouveau
style, provides a relaxing, informal, and friendly atmosphere.
''The biggest bonus was the daylight,'' said Eric. ''The windows in
the roof make the restaurant like a huge conservatory, and that
impression is developed by the many underlit planters which create a
wonderful atmosphere in the evenings.''
Eric, of architects Eric Cadenhead and Associates (24 Cleveden
Gardens), which also specialises in interior design, was also
responsible for the combination of black tables and chairs with subtle
Black Watch tartan upholstery, clean-cut French-style counter area,
wooden floor (saved from the gymnasium of the former Westbourne school
for girls), and his own art nouveau-influenced ornate ironwork.
As for the menu, it changes daily.
''In the mornings it's mainly coffees (the brasserie serves on Costa
No 1 blend) and our own scones, and we do cook breakfasts on request.
Lunch starts at about 11.30am and goes right through until 6pm. We serve
food all day,'' said Helen, who started the Underground Gallery 14 years
ago with a background in outside catering.
The brasserie serves soup with bread and butter (#1.60) or sweet-cure
rollmops (#1.90) for starters; a choice of main course including quiche
and salad (#3.90), lasagne (#3.60), vegetarian dish of the day (from
#3.50), chicken dish of the day (from #4); and desserts ranging from
various tartes and gateaux, caramel shortbread, and fudge slice. Baked
potatoes with various fillings, and snacks are also available.
The day's ''special'' was a choice between cream of parsnip soup or
pea soup, slimmer's orange chicken (#4), Stornoway Black Pudding
(#3.70), sole terrine (#3.50), vegetable pasta bake (#3.60), and the
chef's own apple crumble or bakewell pudding.
The extensive wine list includes bottles from Australia, France, and
South Africa; and there is a good selection of designer beers and
spirits.
And of course anything available in the restaurant can be bought from
the delicatessen which has all the usual quality foods. Helen is also
sourcing delicacies from Alsace and Provence and a range of smoked
products from an English supplier to Harrods.
''Helen's main idea for the deli is that people can take away entire
meals and wine, for a dinner party, for example. We are also setting up
sandwich ordering by fax and telephone which will be particularly useful
for the business community.''
In the restaurant, where it is intended to provide table service on
the mezzanine floor as an additional service to business customers, one
of several features which add to the ambience is the ironwork.
''I'm a great lover of art nouveau but I resisted the temptation to go
down the road of Charles Rennie Mackintosh,'' said Eric. ''In fact the
outside metalwork is reminiscent of Hector Guimard who designed the
plant-like ironwork entrances for the Paris Metro. Again we chose it to
try keep an affinity with the French.''
Replicas of Eric's designs were created by Australian Bill McAnally of
Miranda Engineering in Paisley, a brasserie customer. ''He had never
done anything like this before,'' said Eric, ''but he volunteered to try
and, being a perfectionist, did a wonderful job. It's quite appropriate
that work for a place called the Metro should be done by someone from
'down under'.''
So with the Australian, French and Scottish influences, and customers
from all over the world -- both tourists and the visitors from overseas
who attend Glasgow University -- the brasserie has a truly cosmopolitan
atmosphere.
Glasgow Development Agency were delighted to provide top-up funding
for the ''bold'' Brasserie Metro enterprise.

Ankara, Tuesday
jj
MORE than Iraqi 1500 villagers fled in vehicles loaded with goats and
belongings today as Turkish troops battled hard against Kurdish
guerrillas.
The growing streams of refugees could increase Western pressure on
Turkey, which sent troops across the border last week to strike Turkish
Kurdish rebel bases.
Some 35,000 Turkish troops, backed by warplanes and tanks, are in the
operation to wipe out bases of the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the
PKK.
Some Western officials and rights groups have appealed to Turkey to
steer away from civilian areas and quickly pull back across the border.
Turkey's president, Suleyman Demirel, has suggested that troops could
remain in northern Iraq for up to a year, but Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller said the military will withdraw once the rebel bases are
destroyed.
Fighting broke out on several fronts today as rebels struck back.
Officials said 62 rebels were killed in a clash in the Khakurk region
near Iran and eight others in Sindi region, six miles east from Zakho.
Fierce fighting also was reported in the mountains in Begova and Kani
Masi regions, north-east of Zakho.
The latest report increased the rebel death toll to 269 in the Turkish
operation which started on March 20. Seventeen Turkish soldiers have
died, the military said.
Up to 2000 villagers fled south near Zakho, riding in trucks and cars
packed with goats, gas canisters, plastic water jugs and bedding.
In Geneva Swiss riot police used teargas and water cannon to force 200
angry Turkish Kurd demonstrators from the grounds of the United Nations'
European headquarters.
Displaced Turkish Kurds pushed their way into a UN aid compound at
Zakho demanding to be taken to safety.
The 177 men, women and children parked a minibus and 10 trucks, one of
them full of sheep, and set up camp on a football pitch on a promise the
United Nations would escort them to safety by Thursday along with other
refugees.
It will be the second UN evacuation of refugees.--AP

Spring has supposedly sprung, we have even put the clocks forward to
official British Summer Time, but nobody told the weather. Glasgow's
parks and recreation committee chairman Councillor Colin McNicol turned
up at the city's George Square to be presented with a batch of grass
cutters needed to help keep the city's 16,800 lawns in trim -- in a
heavy snow shower. Perhaps an order for miniature snowploughs might have
been in order.

HERE'S one to dream about. You've just won the lottery, and you're
looking for somewhere in the West where you can sit on the verandah and
watch the yachts with their spinnakers go by.
So you go somewhere near the Cloch light, and there it is -- a
#1m-plus property, bolted to the cliff face, rather upmarket. It has
just had a #100,000 refurb.
The house is built in a distinctive triple pagoda format, providing
three discrete areas. It has five bedrooms, all with en-suite; four
public rooms; and a palatial kitchen. There's a heated swimming pool, of
course, and a triple garage, and it is all set in 13 acres of landscaped
grounds. The airport's about 35 minutes away.
''Yours for #5000 a month on long lease,'' says Brian Watson, MD of
The Accommodation Company.
I would say it's the most expensive residence built in Scotland in
recent years, and the rental is only a fraction of the true costs for
such a property. It's a real bargain.'' It's simply a reflection of the
current market, he adds. Demand for one-and two-bedroom flats is
insatiable; they come on the register and go out in a flash. The larger,
family home is in less demand at this time of year and this is reflected
in the mothly rentals.
There is, for example, an attractive Ayrshire farmhouse on the books
of The Accommodation Company. It takes in nine apartments, with four
bathrooms, garaging for five cars and stables for five horses.
Just what you always wanted. A snip at #1000 a month, and the
housekeeper's cottage is available separately.
Or there's a new-build at Bothwell: never been lived in. What looks
like an upper floor conservatory is actually the master bedroom, with
hardwood balcony on stilts. You get three more bedrooms, three public
rooms, a dining hall, kitchen, bathroom, double garage with office off.
There's a heated swimming pool and access to a leisure complex with
sauna and bar. All-in rental is #2500 a month. Leave the leisure complex
aside and it's down to #1500.
Perhaps you're really looking for a flat, after all. A modern
cottage-type in Kelvindale, with lounge/dining room, double bedroom,
bathroom and kitchen comes in at #420 a month.
The popular Waterfront area can provide a one-bedroom property,
lounge/dining room, kitchen and bathroom, private parking space, for
around #450.
Brian Watson says: ''There is a wide sector of demand for flats, and
with more young first-timers in the market they are rather scarce.
''There are the transient executives, the contract workers here for
relatively short stay. They want something handy for the amenities.
''There has to be value for money, and it is the market that determines
what goes. If you are looking for family-size property, there are some
good bargains available.''

AN upmarket caravan can offer a cost-effective way of enjoying the
benefits of a holiday home without the costs and commitment of bricks
and mortar.
With some 19 parks in Scotland, England and Wales, Bourne Leisure
Group claims to be the UK's largest privately-owned leisure park
operator, specialising in 'holiday homes' - good quality caravans,in the
main.
The Homebuyer Show will feature the company's four Scottish parks -
Haggerston Castle, Berwick Holiday Centre, Seton Sands Holiday Village,
and Wemyss Bay Holiday Park. Each of the parks has its own leisure
facilities.
Some holiday home owners sub-let their caravans to earn a little extra
income, or to offset costs.
Bourne will be working in conjunction with Willerby Caravans, a firm
which will be displaying its latest concept in holiday homes.
Visitors to the Bourne stand can take part in a competition for a
two-week family holiday at the firm's holiday park in Florida (it also
has one in Canada).

THE first English tourists arrived in Cyprus in 1191, when the island
was seized by troops taking part in the Third Crusade -- an episode
which makes those German tourists and their beach towels seem like small
beer. Ever since then, it would seem, Cyprus has been a favourite
destination for British holidaymakers and overseas purchasers.
The island lies at the naval crossroads of three continents -- Europe,
Asia, and Africa -- and its culture shows the influence of all three
neighbouring land masses.
The island is effectively split in two, with the Turkish Cypriots
controlling about a third of the island to the north and the Greek
Cypriots the remainder.
The overwhelming proportion of tourist activity takes place in the
south. The locals are friendly and have embraced tourism as a major part
of their economy.
Many of the people speak English and, as if to make UK visitors feel
even more at home, they even drive on the left. The island is a large
one and offers a wide range of beaches, charming villages, and ancient
ruins.
The interior has jagged mountains and cool forests. The island's
strategic location has made it an important player in Mediterranean
history; just about anyone who was anyone sent his troops there at some
time or another.
The Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, and Romans have all
made their mark on Cyprus before the Crusaders arrived like
Johnny-come-latelies.
Many people fall in love with Cyprus at first sight, which is
appropriate since Paphos on the west coast is the birthplace of Venus,
the goddess of love.
One of the major development companies in Cyprus is Cosmo Developers,
a member of the G Paraskevaides Group of Companies. The company is
creating a selection of holiday and second home apartments and villas
designed to appeal to a wide range of people.
The company claims that its Thera Land is the most prestigious
development on the island. It is set on the beach front, five miles from
Limassol town centre and is adjacent to the luxurious Meridien and
Sheraton hotels. The Limassol Yachting Marina is only 400 metres away.
The development has its own swimming pool and tennis court. The
extensive common areas are landscaped with lush gardens, ponds,
fountains and tranquil pathways.
Further inland, Neos Zephyros Village is located on a hilltop, three
miles from Limassol with magnificent views of the sea and surrounding
scenery.
''It is an exciting new village created for our time, that captures
the spirit of a timeless island,'' says a company spokeswoman.
''Architecturally, the villas of Neos Zephyros are designed with a
captivating charm and character that the centuries have bestowed to the
island homes.'' The village enjoys a common swimming pool and a tennis
court.
Arcadia Village is situated at the seafront in Paphos, off the Tombs
of the Kings Road, an archaelogical site.
It is within walking distance of the St George's and Laoura hotels in
one of the most prestigious areas of Paphos district.
It offers a range of two and three-bedroom villas, two-bedroom
bungalows, and apartments with their own small gardens. The developer
claims that they are all designed with individual character and quality
materials.
Arcadia village also has a swimming pool at the seafront.
The latest project available for sale is Nemea Gardens, a development
on the Tala Village hilltop with magnificent views of Paphos Town and
the Mediterranean. It is located only a five-minute stroll from the
village square and 10 minutes drive from the town centre.
Nemea consists of 32 detached two-bedroom villas, all set in their own
private yard with the majority large enough to accommodate their own
private swimming pool.

IMAGINE a typical July day in Glasgow -- so it is probably raining.
But you don't care. You are stepping on to a plane at Glasgow Airport
and less than three hours later you will be stepping out into the
Spanish sunshine.
Within a short time you will be sitting on your own balcony, in your
own Spanish villa, enjoying a glass of rioja or sangria.
The contrast in the climate, the virtual guarantee that for much of
the year the weather there will be better then Scotland's, is the main
reason why Spain is a favourite destination for Scots who want a
property overseas.
Any purchase overseas requires care. Different countries have their
own legal and purchase systems, but buying in Spain is a fairly
straightforward process. One of the Spanish developments represented at
the show is El Capistrano, a project that consists of four individually
villages near Nerja on the Costa del Sol, Spain's sunny southern coast.
Essex-based Overseas Leisure Consultancy and Lesargo Management
Services of Nerja offer a full sales service, backed by a streamlined
management system in Spain.
Purchasers at El Capistrano get the benefit of 24-hour security,
on-site medical facilities, maid service, bus service, supermarkets,
restaurants, swimming pools, and well-kept gardens.
Each of the villages is different in style, but they all aim to offer
peace and tranquillity for the purchaser who wants to retire to Spain.
They also offer a wide range of facilities for the family seeking a
holiday atmosphere. The properties in the villages have been laid out so
that no two styles are set together.
There is an Andalucian look to the villas, with attractive cobbled
streets and flower filled nooks and crannies. All this is backed up with
an after-sales service.
El Capistrano is set in the foothills of the Almijara mountain range,
not far from the old fishing town of Nerja. It is also within walking
distance of Burriana Beach, which stretches for two miles.
El Capistrano's developers have 10 years' experience in dealing with
villa sales and they offer a wide range of one, two, and three-bedroom
villas for sale.
Prices for fully furnished properties, complete with freehold title,
range from #25,000 to #150,000. For further details contact Overseas
Leisure at the show.

BUYING holiday bonds or timeshare options is always a daunting
prospect. With so many fly-by-nights in the market it is sometimes hard
for the decent operators to convince the public that their investment is
safe.
One way of ensuring that you are not being ripped off is to buy from a
company that has a blue-chip, worldwide reputation. Membership of a
Disney Vacation Club resort -- a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company
-- offers a combination of fun, flexibility, and quality, not to mention
a choice in holiday destinations.
For a one-off purchase price and an annual subscription, guests can
purchase a deeded real estate interest in a Disney Vacation Club resort.
Currently there is one located at Walt Disney World near Orlando,
Florida, and an oceanfront resort at Vero Beach on Florida's Atlantic
Coast, due to open later this year.
Other resorts are planned at Hilton Head Island in South Carolina and
Newport Beach in California; both are expected to become part of the
Disney Vacation Club subject to all the necessary government approvals.
Each resort will meet Disney's exacting standards of quality and will
include a range of facilities. For example, the Vero Beach Resort will
have a swimming pool, restaurant, tennis courts, grocery store, and
recreation areas.
Depending on the size of the real estate interest purchased, members
receive an annual allocation of vacation points.
At Walt Disney World and Vero Beach these can vary from 210 to 2000
points (the average US member has a little in excess of 255 points,
which equates to just over #10,000 at the Financial Times exchange rate
on February 15, 1995).
In both these locations the points remain in effect until January 31,
2042. The flexibility of the specially designed point-based reservation
system allows Disney Vacation Club members to choose how best to use
their points; they can use them for one long holiday or for a series of
shorter breaks; they can use them to holiday with family and friends, or
they can even use their points to reserve accommodation for friends as a
gift.
The number of vacation points required for each stay is based on
resort, accommodation size -- ranging from deluxe studios to spacious
villas -- the length of stay and the time of year they wish to enjoy
their holiday. All reservations are, of course, subject to availability.
Lesley Angus, European director of sales and marketing, says: ''The
vacation point system allows members to select the type of holidays that
are best suited to their needs and even allows them to save points to
use the following year, or borrow from the following year, in order to
enjoy longer holiday stays or larger accommodation now -- if they have a
particular holiday requirement.''
In addition to their Disney Vacation Club ''home'' resort, members
have access, through a special Member Getaways programme, to other
Disney Vacation Club resorts and premium Disney hotels.
The Member Getaways programme also offers members the opportunity to
visit more than 100 selected resorts worldwide. Arranging Disney
Vacation Club holidays is made simple and hassle free through a
''one-stop shopping'' approach to booking; members can call a Disney
vacation adviser, using an exclusive number, to help book air travel,
resort accommodation, and any special programmes and services available
to them.
There are more then 12,000 Disney Vacation Club members, with so far
more than 400 in the UK.

THE sales tide seems to be running in favour of Tay Homes at the
firm's Dalgety Bay site in Fife. A total of nine homes were sold within
a single week, following the opening of three new showflats at the
company's St David's Harbour Village development on the Forth estuary.
The building firm believes that new exterior and interior designs have
been the key to unlocking the sales.
''St David's Harbour Village has proved popular for a number of
reasons,'' says Iain Stewart, Tay Homes' sales director. ''The location
is unmatched by the majority of new homes developments in the Central
Belt, and the new designs complement the location.
Only three homes remain unsold from phase two, ranging in price from
#44,250 for a one-bedroom flat to #66,250 for a three-bedroom terraced
house.
Tay has started work on the third phase of the development. ''We
expect further strong interest,'' says Iain Stewart. The third release
comprises 15 one and two-bedroom apartments.

HOUSE hunters should ''look for a home built with pride'', says the
National House-Building Council (NHBC). The organisation will officially
launch a new-look Pride in the Job campaign to the Scottish home-buying
public at this weekend's Homebuyer Show.
The NHBC recognises that buying a new home represents the largest
investment that the average person will ever make. But how do you make
sure you are buying a house that has been built to the highest
standards?
The NHBC is the standard setting and premier warranty organisation for
the new home industry. Its Pride in the Job campaign is widely
acknowledged as the most prestigious quality initiative within the UK
house-building industry.
Since its inception, Pride in the Job has contributed towards
attaining higher standards in new home construction.
''The initiative rewards those site managers who have demonstrated an
outstanding commitment to quality workmanship with a series of awards
that are highly prized within the industry.
This year the campaign has been given a number of refreshing changes
to reflect the needs of today's house-building industry. All site
managers working for NHBC-registered house-builders are still
automatically eligible for inclusion.
However, the improved formula sees the introduction of new categories,
a revised judging criteria, and an extended judging timetable. The
organisers hope that these changes will give the competition the added
edge to inspire even greater numbers of site managers to produce the
highest calibre of work.
Throughout the year, a team of fully qualified NHBC Inspectors visits
sites in the UK to make their assessments. Out of an approximate 16,000
eligible entrants, only a small percentage are selected to receive an
award.
The awards are now divided into four stages throughout the year. The
first announcement will be made in July, when a nationwide list of 400
site managers will be selected to receive the Quality Award.
The judging will then continue on a regional basis to find the 200
site managers who have reached a regional shortlist to collect a Seal of
Excellence.
The shortlist will be further reduced by competitive elimination to
find the Regional Award winners in each of the NHBC regions across
Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
These winners will then become candidates for the ultimate industry
accolade - a UK Supreme Award. Judging for this award will be carried
out by a small team of independent experts who visit each regional award
winning site.
The winners names will be revealed in December.
A Pride in the Job winning site will not be hard to miss. Flags and
display boards with the distinctive new Pride in the Job logo will
proudly be positioned throughout the site.
The NHBC says that buyers who seek out winning sites can rest assured
that it has 'truly been built with pride.'
Buildmark gives 10 years cover against loss. One of the major benefits
of buying a new home.
The NHBC issues ten year insurance cover, known as the Buildmark, on
around 90% of all new homes for sale throughout Scotland.
The Buildmark is not given lightly - Scottish builders have to go
through a strict technical vetting system to become registered with
NHBC, and they then have to conform to NHBC's Standards in the
construction and workmanship of all new homes they build.
Only when the NHBC Inspectors have carried out their spot checks on
site and are satisfied that the home conforms to NHBC standards, will
the Buildmark cover be granted and sold on to the purchaser as one of
the major benefits of buying a brand new home.
The buildmark gives new home buyers ten years of protection against
loss caused in three main ways.
It protects against loss of the deposit if the builder goes bankrupt
before completion of the property, and also provides cover during the
first two years against defects due to faulty workmanship or materials,
or in the case of builder default. From the third to the tenth year, the
purchaser is protected against serious financial loss due to major
structural damage.
It is recommended that new home buyers check their builder is
registered with NHBC, that the house carries the buildmark insurance
cover, and that the purchasers read their Buildmark policy carefully to
know exactly what is covered and what is not.
This will provide additional peace of mind and ensure the benefits and
subsequent owners within the ten year life of the policy.
Buyer's checklist
The NHBC gives the following advice to anyone considering the purchase
of a new home
* Check that your builder is NHBC registered
* Check that your home will have the Buildmark insurance cover
* Check that your builder has a good national or local reputation
* Visit the site. Is it tidy with material neatly stowed etc?
* If you need a mortgage, make enquiries at an early stage
* Employ a solicitor (or registered conveyancer) and seek professional
advice if you are in doubt
* After exchanging contracts, ask your solicitor for your Buildmark
insurance policy and read it carefully
* Before completing your purchase, inspect your new home carefully,
especially baths, basins, etc.
* Report any defect in writing to your builder as soon as possible,
and be sure to keep a copy
* If in dispute with your builder write to NHBC

THIS weekend the SECC is the venue for the Scottish Homebuyer Show, an
event that brings together a wide range of developers, agents, lenders,
and property consultants.
''We'll have thousands of properties on show, along with all the
advice you need to help successfully buy or sell your home in Scotland
or overseas,'' says organiser Mike Bridge.
''The show offers a great opportunity for Scots to shop around and
compare prices with leading home builders, estate agents, self-build
companies, park home operators, letting agents, banks, solicitors, and
mortgage brokers.''
From Friday till Sunday, serious buyers will rub shoulders with casual
browsers while first-time buyers and would-be sellers will attend
specialist seminars. Everyone attending the show will have the
opportunity to win up to #5000 of mortgage payments.
Leading banks like the TSB, Bank of Scotland, and the Royal Bank will
provide instant mortgage print-outs of what would-be purchasers can
afford.
A wide variety of house builders will be taking part, including Miller
Homes, Bellway, Taywood, Avonside, L &amp; C Homes, National House-Building
Council, Tay Homes, Welcome Homes, and Century Homes.
Some of Scotland's most prominent estate agents will offer homes
throughout central Scotland and further afield.
Estate agent Roy Slater is taking no less than three stands at the
Scottish Homebuyer Show.
''It's a great opportunity to bring a wide range of houses to the
attention of the Scottish public,'' he says. ''I was very impressed by
last year's show and by the interest from the visitors.''
He will be displaying details of hundreds of properties, ranging in
price from #29,000 to a home that costs #1m. ''I'll also be exclusively
releasing details of a very exciting new development which will be a
hallmark of the new, stylish Glasgow,'' he promises.
Other agents at the show include Clyde Property (a firm that admits it
only turned up last year out of a sense of duty, but did so much
business that it is coming with a full complement of staff and computers
this year), Donald Storrie, Graham Miller, Nationwide, and Welch &amp; Roe,
among others.
But the estate agents won't have it all their own way. Recent
competition with solicitors who also feel that they can effectively sell
homes has reached an intense level.
The lawyers, and their selling capacity, will be represented at the
show by the Glasgow Solicitors Property Centre and its east of Scotland
equivalent, the Edinburgh Solicitors Property Centre.
For those who are happy and well established in their homes in
Scotland, the show also offers a unique opportunity to consider buying a
home overseas. A wide range of properties in sun spots like Florida,
Spain, Colorado, Cyprus, Portugal, and Tenerife will be on display.
Would-be buyers will have the advantage of considering locations,
prices, and developers in the cool setting of the SECC rather than the
hothouse atmosphere of a visit to a development during a summer holiday.
Free seminars on The A-Z of Buying a Home in Scotland, Living and
Running a Business in Florida and How to Sell Your home in Scotland will
take place three times daily.
Scottish Television's Home Show programme, hosted by Viv Lumsden and
Alan Douglas, is playing a major role at the SECC. Both personalities
will be in attendance and Scottish TV will be running demonstrations and
competitions during the show. The top prize-winner will have his or her
mortgage paid for a year, up to a maximum of #5000.
Those who want to take the bold step of breaking free from bricks and
mortar can have a look at mobile homes offered by specialist operators.
Other exhibitors include interior designers, lawyers, timber frame
builders, the Prince's Scottish Business Youth Trust, and private rental
specialists Quality Street.
Anyone who wants to buy or sell at home or abroad, or simply consider
their options, should be at the SECC this weekend.
For the rest of this year there will be no greater opportunity to
''view'' such an extensive range of options under one roof.

By JAMES TRAYNOR in Moscow
IT is best not to study either the Russian or Scottish squads.
Scanning the list of names could lead grown men, hardened and
far-travelled Scottish football fans, to break down and weep into their
stolichnaya.
Indeed, at a time like this when the Scotland international side is
even more bereft of genuine talent than is normal, the best thing to do
is listen to the manager.
Nobody else can talk up the credentials of essentially ordinary
players like Craig Brown. He does it so well that even though experience
tells you otherwise, Brown persuades his listeners that he is in charge
of a squad of players who somehow, and almost overnight, have been
transformed into exceptional talents.
If only they were half as good as Brown's eulogies we would be world
champions, but it is not important what any of us may think of the
squad. What matters is how good the Russians believe us to be and also
the extent of the feel good factor which Brown has instilled within his
camp.
As usual, injuries and other afflictions, such as loss of form, caused
a serious depletion of resources, but those who made it to Moscow must
not harbour doubts. They face a formidable task in the Luhzniki Stadium
tonight and they will have to be bold if nothing else.
''I wouldn't go as far as to say we would be finished if we lose, but
this is a big match,'' said Scottish captain Gary McAllister. ''This
will be one of the big results in our group.''
The Russians, who drew 1-1 at Hampden last November, are fourth in
Group 8 with four points, but have played only twice so far. Scotland
are second with seven points after four matches, but having lost 1-0
away to the Greeks who have maximum points from four games. Brown's
players need to enjoy the benefits of even a draw in Moscow.
''We need to start collecting more points,'' said Brown, ''and we need
to find a strike force which will bring us goals because we are going
into a period in which it will be vital that we score regularly.''
Bolton's John McGinlay and Hibernian striker Darren Jackson mainly,
will be charged with the responsibility of breaching Russia's defences,
even though they have never played together before. McGinlay will be
winning his sixth cap -- he has scored two goals so far -- while Jackson
will be making his debut, but as I say, it is best not to dwell on the
negative.
Perhaps we should concentrate on more hopeful aspects of the squad
such as Jim Leighton's vast experience gained during the accumulation of
62 caps. ''He can be an inspirational figure and all our players have
tremendous respect for him,'' said Brown who was given cause for fresh
optimism from unlikely sources yesterday.
The Luhzniki stadium like many of Moscows structures, has known better
times. A shortage of money and weaker emphasis on sporting excellence
since the break-up of the Soviet Union, has allowed the ground to fall
into disrepair and even the surface is poor. The turf was covered by
thick snow until recently and is yellowish and rutted.
''It's bumpy and not at all as smooth as Hampden and I wouldn't think
that would suit the Russians,'' said McAllister who has been told to
take a free role in midfield.
In recent weeks, Leeds United have asked him to play further forward
in support of the strikers and it has been working well. ''Craig has
told me to do the same against Russia,'' McAllister said, ''I haven't to
bother with defensive duties unless it is necessary.
''I will be reading the play and making decisions depending on what is
happening around me. That will be a responsibility I am happy to
accept.''
McAllister was always going to be Scotland's main player and much may
depend on his movements, passing, and analysis. If he does manage to get
forward in support of attacks that would have the added benefit of
driving the creative Victor Onopko deeper.
The current apathy towards football caused by the Muscovites' more
pressing need to cope with growing poverty means Scotland won't be
playing before a full house and that might be used to their advantage
also.
''It is our plan to get up and at them and knock them off their
passing rhythm, '' said Brown. ''The best way to stop Russia is to take
the ball and make sure they don't get it back easily.''
Although he does his best to disguise any anxiety about the standards
of players his own group are about to meet, there can be little doubt
Brown is wary. In particular, he must be worried about Serguei Kiriakov,
although he limped into Russia's training camp at the weekend and
indications were yesterday that he would not play against the Scots.
''If he doesn't play,I'll be more than pleased,'' said Brown.
''Because his scoring record at international level is exceptional.
Kiriakov has scored 14 times in 22 matches so it would do our cause no
harm at all if the Russians don't play him.''
If Russia's coach Oleg Romantsev is forced to go without his striker
then Werder Bremen's Vladimir Bestchastnykh would come in, hoping to
take advantage of any crosses supplied by Andrei Kanchelskis, but that's
where Celtic's Tommy Boyd will have to do a job.
Aberdeen's Stewart McKimmie was declared fit after yesterday's
training session and he will play on the left side under instructions to
push forward into midfield as often as possible.
Gary McAllister summed it up: ''We really have to get something here
and it isn't beyond us.''

Russia Under-21 1, Scotland Under-21 2
SCOTLAND pushed themselves into a powerful position in their European
Championship under-21 qualifying group with this impressive victory.
It was the third win in succession for the young Scots with two of
these results coming against the powerful Russians and the other a
remarkable away win in Athens against Greece.
The opening defeat in Helsinki is now a fading memory for coach Tommy
Craig and his youngsters.
The nine points they have racked up make them potential group winners
with a place in the quarter-finals waiting.
Yesterday's result at the Torpedo Stadium was all the more welcome
because they had gone behind in 25 minutes. But goals from Charlie
Miller and Dougie Freedman ensured victory.
Certainly it was tinged with a small piece of luck when Aberdeen
keeper Derek Stillie handled the ball outside the box in 66 minutes and
escaped with only a yellow card.
As team manager Craig admitted afterwards: ''He was perhaps a little
fortunate to stay on the field.''
Craig, however, could point to another decision which went against the
Scots. Just a minute after Stillie courted danger, Charlie Miller was
scythed down in the box, but instead of a penalty award to the Scots,
Romanian referee Gheorgi Constantin booked the Ibrox star for diving --
a decision which rules him out of the next match against San Marino. He
had already collected a caution in Greece.
Craig said: ''It was a penalty and I feel sorry for Charlie, he
suffered twice, not getting the award and then being cautioned. Still,
this was a great result.''
The opening goal came when Christian Dailly slipped as he was about to
challenge Evgueni Ckharlachev. The Russian passed across the front of
goal and Lebed finished off with a low shot.
It was fitting that Scotland's equaliser should come from one of
Duncan Jupp's penetrating runs down the right. This time his cross was
partially cleared and Miller hammered a shot from 20 yards past the
keeper.
Later Miller admitted: ''It took a little bit of a deflection -- but
it was always going in.''
There was no deflection necessary in 80 minutes when Freedman tapped
in Stevie Crawford's cross.
RUSSIA -- Nigmatulline, Borzenkov, Lipko, Kharlachev, Kurnachov,
Mashkarin, Kliouyev, Nekrassov, Rychkov, Lebed, Beschastnikh.
Substitutes -- Bokov, Kachanov.
SCOTLAND -- Stillie, Jupp, Bollan, Dailly, Pressley, Hannah, McNamara,
Miller, Crawford, Freedman, McLoughlin. Substitutes -- O'Neill, Harper.
Referee -- G Constantin (Romania).

DUNDEE United chairman Jim McLean yesterday called in one of his
former pupils to lead the team out of the relegation zone and bring it
back to prominence in the premier division.
The appointment of 36-year-old Billy Kirkwood, who has been reserve
coach with Rangers for close to four years, comes just two weeks after
the dismissal of Croatian Ivan Golac.
Kirkwood has been favourite for the job, but it was thought that the
caretaker co-operative of Gordon Wallace, Paul Hegarty and Maurice
Malpas would continue untill the end of the season.
Instead, Kirkwood, whose first game in charge, ironically, will be
against Rangers at Tannadice this Saturday, has been brought in after
only two more games, which have yielded just one point.
McLean insisted that the club were now satisfied they had found the
right man, but refused to reveal the length of contract.
Kirkwood said ''I have had one or two offers to go on my own, but this
is the sort of challenge that appeals to me. I have learned a lot,
particularly in the last four years at Ibrox.''
McLean said: ''Billy was always one of the most committed players and
we are confident that commitment still exists.''
Rangers manager Walter Smith said: ''He is ready for the job and will
do it well. He has had a lot of success with Rangers' reserve team.''

A FEW years ago, it was a tennis court. Now all that's left of its
sporty past is an old stone perimeter wall. In place of a tennis court
is a beautiful garden, landscaped with rose beds, shrubs, spring flowers
and a pond spanned by a charming footbridge.
Even on a day when wind and rain could pound a daffodil bed into a
disaster area, the garden seems full of interest and promise of colour
soon to come.
It's not surprising that Corngabbie has plenty of large windows that
enjoy views over the garden's carefully tended lawns and plants.
Sitting at the top of a hill in Upper Colquhoun street, on the edge of
Helensburgh, this striking house is as unusual as its name.
Ann Yorke admits she doesn't know the meaning, though she was told
that the previous owner named the house after a village in the
North-east from which she originated.
After crossing the footbridge with what appears to be resting water
lilies beneath its cobbled arch, the front door leads into a large hall.
Beyond is an even more spectacular sitting room, rising to a gallery
on one side and a small balcony on the other.
The architect who built the house clearly had practicality as well as
contemporary styling much in mind. As well as its interesting details,
the layout of the house seems to make perfect sense. All the available
space is used in making the rooms comfortably large, while little is
wasted on stairs or corridors.
The large, fitted kitchen with its ceramic-tiled floor is next to a
breakfasting room and the large dining room. Beyond the kitchen is a
utility room with matching units.
The dining room is carpeted and painted in pale pampas colours and
there are sliding patio doors to make dining on warmer days even more
pleasant. The ceiling above the kitchen and breakfast room is of rich
honey-coloured pine, and the same timber is used generously throughout
the house.
It's especially effective on the stairs and suspended landing that
crosses the hall almost like another gallery.
The sitting room is the centre piece of the house with its high 16ft
sweeps of wall and large patio doors that lead onto the garden. It's on
split levels with a centre seating well giving the room a feeling of
intimacy when the gas flame fire is alight.
The small balcony and the gallery above are of the same varnished
pine, while book shelves line the gallery wall.
The main bedroom with its blue and white tiled en-suite bathroom leads
off the sitting room and there are fitted cupboards with smoked glass
doors along one side.
A spacious guest room with its own bathroom completes the ground floor
of the house.
Upstairs there is a third bathroom and three more bedrooms, with a
fourth currently used as a large and comfortable study that has enough
floor space for a leather suite, central table and imposing desk.
All the bedrooms have generous fitted wardrobes and space for double
or twin beds.
''Two of the rooms are adjoining and we have used one as a playroom
and then later a sitting room for the children,'' says Ann.
There is also a good view of the Firth and the hills of Rosneath on
the far side.
A regular professional gardener has transformed the former tennis
court to its present tranquil state, and it's hard to imagine serving
anything more energetic than a cream tea on its well trimmed lawn now.

ANDY Cole may be the highest-priced footballer in England, but tonight
he will have to sit on the bench as Terry Venables' first choice face
Uruguay at Wembley.
Venables has decided to stand by Tottenham stalwart Teddy Sheringham
to fill the void left by the injured Alan Shearer. The Spurs striker,
one of five changes from the side short-circuited by the hooligans in
Dublin, goes into his sixth international still searching for his first
England goal. Venables is a believer in club relationships and teams
Sheringham with winger Darren Anderton.
Barry Venison fills Paul Ince's midfield anchor role, while Tim
Flowers returns in goal; John Barnes resumes on the left for the axed
Matthew Le Tissier, and full back Rob Jones wins his eighth cap in place
of Warren Barton.
ENGLAND -- Flowers (Blackburn), Jones (Liverpool), Adams (Arsenal),
Pallister (Manchester United), Le Saux (Blackburn), Barnes (Liverpool),
Venison (Newcastle), Platt (Sampdoria), Beardsley (Newcastle),
Sheringham (Tottenham), Anderton (Tottenham).
URUGUAY -- Ferro (Penarol), Lopez (River Plate), Aguirregaray
(Penarol), Gutierrez (Nacional), Montero (Atalanta, Italy), Dorta
(Penarol), Cedres (River Plate, Argentina), Bengoechea (Penarol), Poyet
(Real Zaragoza, Spain), Francescoli (River Plate, Argentina), Fonseca

KEN GALLACHER in Moscow
DARREN Jackson will make his Scotland debut against Russia today and
is convinced that only a self-imposed curb on his own on-field back-chat
has carried him into the national side.
For Jackson, it remains the biggest honour of his career. That may
sound old fashioned in these mercenary days, but Jackson was sincere
when he said just how much this cap will mean to him.
''Playing for Scotland is very important to me,'' he admitted. ''John
Robertson of Hearts, has told me that it will really hit me when I'm out
there in the middle of the pitch and the National Anthem is playing. He
said that's when he felt it, and I know I'll be the same.''
Jackson was named by Craig Brown yesterday for the important European
Championship qualifying clash and the Scotland manager insisted: ''Like
Colin Calderwood, Jackson's had to wait a long time for recognition, but
sometimes that adds to a player's hunger to do well. I have faith in
him.''
Jackson, now 28, thought his chances had gone because of his
indiscipline on the field.
He said: ''It has been a long, long wait -- but that has mainly been
my own fault. I might have had a Scotland place before now if I had kept
my mouth shut.
''I was always getting in trouble and that did not help me, but I have
tried to change.''
Jackson recognises, too, that as captain of Hibs he allowed himself to
be dragged into everyone's battles. He accepted more responsibility than
his manager intended. If there was a fight to be fought then Jackson was
there.
He explained: ''I found myself becoming involved in all sorts of
things, because as captain I thought I had to do that. All that happened
was that I landed myself in trouble.
''Alex Miller, eventually took the captaincy away from me and that
helped. From then on I tried to concentrate only on playing the game.
''I feel I have been more consistent and I have not become involved in
talking back to referees nearly so often.''
He is one of the new players in the squad -- Calderwood is another --
who have not come up through the ranks. He remembers being in two
under-21 squads, but never making the field.
''I think that is why this means so much to me,'' he said, ''you begin
to feel your chance has gone. Now it's here I'm determined to make it a
success.''
Neither Brown nor Jackson's club manager, Alex Miller, is concerned
any longer by that wayward temperament.
Brown said: ''I have no worries at all about Darren. We have had other
players who have had disciplinary problems in domestic football, but
never carried them forward to the international side.
''In all my time with the squad we have had just one player ordered
off -- Richard Gough for a hand ball in Switzerland. It's a record we
are proud of.''
Miller, in Moscow as an assistant to Brown, said: ''There was a time
when Darren was not settling properly at the club and his off-field
problems followed him onto the park. That has changed now. I don't feel
any problems with him at Hibs and there's no reason to think there will
be any problems with his temperament at international level.''
Now all Jackson wants is to form a partnership with John McGinlay up
front and perhaps bring Scotland a result which few of us expect.
He points out: ''John is an easy player to team up with. He is a
goal-scorer and I think we can link up successfully. It doesn't worry me
that I have played slightly deeper for Hibs. I did that for Dundee
United before, but basically, I see myself as a front player.
''I hope I can score a goal and make certain we can get a good result.
That is important to Scotland -- and to me.''
Certainly, the opportunity to establish himself in the team is there.
Craig Brown made that plain when he said: ''We have a lot of front
players who are out at the moment. Obviously, they might have gone in
ahead of Darren. But Darren is here and if he and John McGinlay link
well together it will be up to the others to get them out. They will be
the pair in possession.''

OAKSHAW RIDGE has always been the most prestigious part of Paisley.
Ever since the eighteenth century, anyone who wanted their building
noticed put it in Oakshaw.
Some local historians say that its attractions date back further than
that, and that the low hill might have been the site of a Roman fort.
Amid the many spires that dot the ridge, one landmark stands out - the
dome of the John Neilston Institution. Known locally as the Porridge
Bowl, the Italianate dome is a testament to the architecture of Charles
Wilson.
The restoration and redevelopment of the Institution has provided
twelve apartments of two and three bedrooms and one detached gate house.
The developer was Classical House, a specialist development firm with a
strong track record in bringing fine old buildings back to life.
Their other projects have included the A-listed country homes of
Aitkenhead House, Dalzel House in Motherwell, and the spectacular
restoration of 'Greek' Thomson's townhouse on Glasgow's Great Western
Terrace.
Slater Hogg &amp; Howison is now selling one of the apartments under the
dome of the Porridge Bowl.
The imposing entrance of the Institution leads to a central atrium
which houses a statue of the Greek philosopher Diogenes, by Alexander
Stoddart. The atrium was reproduced to the original 1850 specification,
including the restoration of plasterwork and panelling.
The accommodation includes resident's entrance from the atrium,
split-level reception hall with spiral staircase, three bedrooms,
Victorian style bathroom, and boxroom, with the upper floor providing an
open-plan lounge through to the dining room.
A fixed price of #89,500 is being quoted by the agents.

AN review of all-weather racing published yesterday claims that the
sport has reached capacity and further expansion could damage the
essence of British racing.
The strongest recommendation of the All Weather Track Review Group is
that any expansion on top of the existing 125 sand fixtures should be
controlled.
The report, drafted with the help of 40 submissions, some from
racegoers and punters, does little to dent the image of all-weather
racing as the poor relation of the sport on grass.
Lingfield, Southwell, and Wolverhampton, Britain's three all-weather
courses, are likely to be barred from new fixtures in the summer months,
from May to August, when turf racing is at its peak.
The report stated that allowing expansion in the summer ''would run
the risk of an unacceptable change to the nature of British racing.''
Outside the summer, the review group recommended a new programme of
all-weather racing under floodlights in April, September, and October,
to take advantage of the evening opening of betting shops.
Wolverhampton, the only floodlit racecourse at the moment, will be
asked to move some of its winter fixtures to this period, but the review
group suggested an investigation to determine whether floodlit racing on
turf courses would be viable.
More all-weather fixtures in November may be allowed, although the
alternative is to extend turf racing beyond the end of the normal season
which traditionally closes early that month.
And, of course, any lingering hope that Lanark racecourse may be
reopened as an all-weather track now are dead.
* BRADBURY Star will miss the remainder of the season after having
sustained a leg injury. The gelding last ran in the Queen Mother
Champion Chase at Cheltenham, in which he fell.

CRICKET
QUEENSLAND fast bowler Carl Rackemann has been named as Craig
McDermott's replacement for Australia's forthcoming Test series against
West Indies.
Rackemann learned of his selection, his first Test call-up since 1991,
after his team had beaten South Australia by an innings and 101 runs in
the Sheffield Shield final.
McDermott injured an ankle during a training jog in the West Indies
last week and returned home on Monday.
''I've been too old for three years. This is the last thing I
expected,'' said 34-year-old Rackemann, who has played 12 Tests.
The final day of Australia's match against a West Indies President's
XI was abandoned yesterday in rainy St Lucia. The home team had reached
261 for five in reply to the tourists' 322 for five declared at close.
The first Test starts in Bridgetown on Friday.
* SCOTLAND yesterday appointed an Australian to be their first ever
cricket development officer.
Pete Steindl, who beat off the challenge of 22 other candidates to
land the post, which is based in Glasgow, said: ''There is heaps of
talent around and it will be my job to harness it.''
* WESTERN Union champions Ayr have signed 24-year-old South African
all-rounder Adrian Holdstock as their professional for the coming
season.
Holdstock, who has played for Western Province and Boland, is
presently assistant coach to Omar Henry at Stellenbosch University.
He replaces Marty Haywood, who has decided to take up a business
career in Sydney.

THE Scotland Under-21 side to meet Italy Under-21 at Bridgehaugh,
Stirling, on April 15 shows just one change to the team which ended the
nine-year run of defeats against the Welsh earlier this month.
The Dundee HS FP scrum half Allan Featherstone comes into the side in
place of Watsonian Jamie Weston, who is on duty with the Scotland
Under-19 squad at the FIRA tournament in Bucharest.
The Scottish youngsters, coached by David Leslie and John Rutherford,
defeated Wales Under-21 at Inverleith 15-9, in the process logging their
first win since 1986.
The Scots have played Italy four times, winning in 1986, drawing the
following year, and losing in 1992 and last year.
Manager Derrick Grant, who hopes to make use of the Scots' pacy
threequarters, said: ''Italy won't be an easy touch. They are, by all
accounts, a physical side who also possess French-like flair.''
Scotland Under-21 -- P W B Flockhart (Stewart's Melville FP); H R
Gilmour (Heriot's FP), M N McGrandles (Stirling County), C A Murray
(Hawick), C Morley (Bath); D W Hodge (Watsonians), A D Featherstone
(Dundee HS FP/Morgan Academy FP); M H McLuskie (Edinburgh Academicals),
G C Bulloch (West of Scotland), B D Stewart (Edinburgh Academicals), I
Elliot (Hawick), P T Jennings (Boroughmuir), T A McVie (Edinburgh
Academicals), D Clark (Stewart's Melville FP), G F Dall (Heriot's FP),
captain.
Replacements -- I S Leighton (Melrose), B R Easson (Boroughmuir), M P
Rennie (Stewart's Melville FP), D R Massey (Currie), L G A Graham, D G
Cunningham (both Boroughmuir), S B Grimes (Edinburgh University).
* THE Scotland World Cup squad is to hold public training sessions in
Perth this weekend. The final 26 to go to South Africa will be chosen on
Tuesday, but on Saturday and Sunday mornings, from 10.30 at the North
Inch, Perth, the provisional squad will go through its paces and the SRU
have declared an open house with refreshments on offer.
The young flanker, Arnaud Costes, was the only surprise selection in
France's World Cup squad announced yesterday. Costes, 21, has won one
cap and was preferred to the experienced Xavier Blond, who is recovering
from a serious knee injury.
Former captain Jean-Francois Tordo and gifted but erratic fly-half
Alain Penaud were not included in the 26.
* SCOTLAND A hooker Kevin McKenzie has taken another step along the
road to the Scotland captaincy by taking the reins of newly crowned
McEwan's first-division champions Stirling County.
McKenzie, who has led the national shadow team for the past two
seasons, was the unanimous choice of his team-mates to take over from
veteran Stewart Hamilton.
County are set to strengthen their squad before the start of next
season's Premier League. McKenzie said: ''In the new set-up there will
be only four top-level matches every Saturday -- and anyone who wants to
play for Scotland will want to be seen at that grade.''
Among those tipped to join the County set are Dundee props Johnny
Manson and Danny Herrington, and GHK's second-row partners Shade Munro
and Alan Watt.
Hamilton is expected to make his farewell league appearance as captain
against his former club, Heriot's, next Wednesday. But County will be
without Scotland squad trio McKenzie, Ian Jardine, and Kenny Logan to
avoid any risk of injury before the World Cup.
* MELROSE wing Gordon Smith scored three of the Scotland Under-18
team's six tries when they opened their Spanish tour with a 44-13 win
over Madrid Youth yesterday.
But Scots' team manager Finlay Calder, captain of the victorious 1989
Lions in Australia, added a note of caution. ''There's a lot of work
still to be done before the international on Sunday,'' he said.
Currie scrum-half Ross Hunter went over for a try after only two
minutes. Stirling County lock Campbell Rae also had a try, as had Anglo
No.8 Ross Beattie. Dundee High's Graeme Kiddie kicked four conversions
and two penalties.
* EDINBURGH Academicals confirmed yesterday that amalgamation
discussions with Edinburgh Wanderers are to be shelved. The Academicals,
one of the founding fathers of Scottish rugby, said in a statement that
after ''considerable discussion'' both clubs had decided that it would
be in ther best interests --for the moment -- to retain their separate
identities.

KILMARNOCK manager Alex Totten is making a determined effort to bring
a new face into his team before Friday's transfer deadline.
But, even if he fails, Totten already has pointed out to his players
that there has to be a revival of earlier form very quickly or the team
who seemed to have hoisted themselves away from the demotion zone will
be in serious trouble.
Totten is keen to find a new striker to boost his squad, but Bolton's
Owen Coyle, the former Airdrie player, has been priced out of reach and
Totten has turned his sights elsewhere.
''I think it is a 50-50 shot that we get someone before the end of the
week,'' said Totten, who some time ago had a #250,000 bid for Coyle
turned down. ''I think the team could use a new face to lift it right
now.''
Kilmarnock meet Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Saturday, and the importance
of that game needs no emphasing to either Totten or Dons' caretaker
manager Roy Aitken.
* MONTROSE sacked manager John Holt yesterday just hours before
meeting Alloa at Recreation Park.
Caretaker manager Andy Dornan's reign got off to a winning start when
a second-half strike by Colin McGlashan earned them the points.
* AIRDRIE'S George Peat is the latest club chairman to draft new plans
for League reconstruction. He plans to write to clubs and officials
outlining plans for a 16-12-12 system to come into place in season
1996-97.

A WEEK before the 1995 hunting season for major titles is declared
open it seems like a good time to identify and discuss, as the
examination papers used to demand, the courses over which the US
Masters, US Open, Open Championship, and US PGA titles will be decided
-- this year a uniquely distinguished quartet.
Augusta National is, of course, the permanent home of the first. In
June the second returns to Shinnecock Hills, the closest in character to
a British links which an American championship course approaches. The
third, for the twenty-fifth time, is at changeless St Andrews, and the
fourth at the charming Riviera Country Club, Los Angeles.
When a tournament takes root it inevitably establishes a constituency
of anecdotes and incidents. Especially on the back nine, five of whose
holes are defended by water, Augusta has formed its reputation for
developing pure theatre on the last afternoon. Yet originally these
holes were the outward half.
There has to be a link between the particular challenge the course
makes and the fact that Alister Mackenzie, who collaborated with Bobby
Jones in its design, became during the First World War, an expert in
camouflage. There is more to Augusta than first meets the eye.
The received wisdom about the course is that the closer the shot to
the flagstick, the harder it becomes -- particularly if the player has
not driven into the right place on the generous fairways, or has hit his
shot on to the green on the ''wrong'' side of the hole. To uncover
Mackenzie's concealment, strategy is all.
Shinnecock's triple claims to distinction are that it was the first
''formal'' golf club in the USA, the first to possess 18 holes, and the
first to have a purpose-built clubhouse. The original course was
designed in 1891 by a Scot, Willie Dunn, and updated 40 years later by
Dick Wilson, one of the most sought-after architects of the post-war
years.
The best description of Shinnecock comes from The World Atlas of Golf.
''While not truly linksland -- the grass of the fairways and greens is
more of an inland texture -- the ambience and windy bleakness on an
average day evoke feelings of the British seaside links.'' There is,
however, a uniquely American association with the club.
Located in Southampton, at the far and fashionable end of Long Island
from New York City, the original clubhouse, opened in 1892, was designed
by Stanford White, the most prominent architect of his day. It
incorporated such modern facilities as a grill room, lockers, and
showers, and became a thriving centre of the social summer whirl.
The Old Course has been examined so relentlessly, at such length, and
over so long a period that further comment seems as pointless as
discussing the idiosyncrasies of a sticky wicket. Its origins may be
lost in antiquity, but its challenge has wonderfully withstood the test
of the centuries.
Some have said that the links were made by God as a practice shot
before he addressed himself to the more urgent demands of Creation.
Others assert that instead of resting on the seventh day, He devised the
course merely to keep his hand in. But as everyone knows, a myth is as
good as a smile.
This observer's experience of Riviera has been confined to winter --
well, their winter -- for the Los Angeles Open in late January or early
February rather than August. And very agreeable it is, as soft breezes
blow in from the nearby Pacific Ocean and the scent of eucalyptus adds
to the Southern California serendipity.
Now Japanese-owned, Riviera has always had strong showbusiness
connections, unlike the aloof Los Angeles Country Club, and the average
golfer is bound to be attracted by its lack of superfluous artifice.
There is no profusion of water, no island green, no decorative waterfall
or fountain. A plain but pleasant challenge.
Also a historic one, for here it was that Ben Hogan, in 1948, won the
first of his four US Opens with a record aggregate of 276, unbeaten for
19 years until Jack Nicklaus's 275 at Baltusrol. And in 1950, Hogan
almost won the Los Angeles Open in his first appearance after his
near-fatal car accident.
If after all the history and incident these four courses have been
responsible for something special does not emerge over these next five
months, the 1995 season will have been an anti-climax. Given the
intensity and the openness of the current competition, a succession of
let-downs seems highly unlikely.

The evenings will get even longer this weekend when the clocks change
and we get an extra hour of daylight. Connoiseurs of long evenings and
twinkling twilights know that the very best are to be found in one the
North-west of Scotland.
Balmacara in Ross-shire is the sort of Highland coastal village with
heart-meltingly beautiful spring and summer evenings.
The Inverness office of chartered surveyors Finlayson Hughes is
marketing a traditional two-storey house at Balmacara, with a garden
which extends to about a yard from the shore of Loch Alsh.
Harled under a slate roof, the house enjoys superb views southwards
across the water towards the hills of Glenelg. Just across the loch is
the south eastern tip of Skye.
Kyle of Lochalsh with its links with Skye is three miles away, and
Eilan Donan, the castle that gets onto every calendar, stands on its
island in the loch just a few miles to the east.
The picturesque village of Plockton with its exotic shrubs, bonny wee
hotels, and yacht haven, is only a few minutes away by road.
This is a house for anyone who enjoys the outdoor life -- walking,
climbing, angling, and sailing are all available just over the doorstep.
Accommodation consists of lounge, dining room and kitchen on the
ground floor, and three bedrooms with bathroom on the second floor.
Outside there is a tree-sheltered garden, ideal for enjoying the sea
views.
Lesley-Ann Fraser, who is handling the sale for Finlayson Hughes,
said: ''A house in Balmacara rarely comes onto the market. In an area
well known for spectacular scenery we expect there will be considerable
interest in this delightful small property of great potential.''
Kyle of Lochalsh has a daily rail service to Inverness, the capital of
the Highlands. There are modern rural primary schools nearby at
Auchtertyre and Kyle of Lochalsh and a high school at Plockton, reputed
to have the top geography department in Britain . Inverness is about 80
miles away by road.

JUST about everyone who ever drove up the side of Loch Lomond, or
climbed the hills above it, has wondered what it would be live right
there... on those bonny, bonny banks.
Making the dream come true is the problem. There are surprisingly few
houses with direct frontage to the loch - and most of them are
expensive.
But right now there is a golden opportunity to take the high road to a
new lifestyle in a beautiful nineteenth-century house which has been
converted into 14 apartments, most of which have spectacular views of
the loch, Ben Lomond and the island of Inchmurrin.
Standing on the shores of Loch Lomond, Arden House combines scenery,
history, and glorious architecture.
Built in 1868 for a Lord Provost of Glasgow and designed by Sir John
James Burnet, one of Scotland's leading architects, it is a remarkable
example of the Scots baronial style and abounds with turrets, towers,
crenelations, gargoyles, coats of arms, and other stone carvings.
Arden House is approached by a private drive. Its communal entrance is
via a vast and impressive hall which contains fine fireplaces,
impressive woodwork, and a some remarkable cornices.
Stained glass windows portraying strange faces gaze down on an
intricate parquet floor. The former dining room has been set aside as a
communal area where residents can gather for New Year parties or private
celebrations. The room is so large that a previous owner converted it
into a three-bedroom flat!
The current owner and redeveloper has torn out all signs of previous
conversions and restored grand rooms to their original proportions.
The enormous entrance portico was designed to allow horses and
carriages to sweep underneath, protecting visitors from the elements. It
is remarkable to think that this grand entrance, the roaring log fires
in the hall, and the fine dining room -- which were all designed for the
exclusive use of a tiny group of society's wealthiest people -- are now
available as the communal areas of a development where individual
apartments cost roughly the same as in the city.
Internal features which could not be restored were copied and
meticulously reproduced to chime in with their originals. Mouldings,
cornicings, ceiling plasterwork and other features have all been
restored or copied with remarkable precision.
The work was carried out under the direction of Historic Scotland and
the local planners, and supervised by architect John Hopkins. It
involved the total rewiring and replumbing of the house, and no fewer
than 55 windows were replaced.
A new gas central heating system has been installed in each flat --
the first time in Scotland that liquid petroleum gas tanks have been
buried underground, their unsightly bulk.
Arden House, which is roughly halfway between Balloch and Luss, was
designed to take advantage of its remarkable setting beside Loch Lomond.
Mountains, hills and beautiful broadleaf trees dominate the scene in
every direction.
The residents and their guests will share the nine-acre garden with
its gravel paths, rhododendrons, mature trees, lawns and shoreside
walks. Yet all of this is available within easy reach of Glasgow. The
city centre is some 25 miles away.
Arden House is being marketed by Clyde Property at prices ranging from
#62,000 to #140,000.

SUCCESS at international level and improved facilities are part of a
new #1.6m partnership announced yesterday between the Scottish Amateur
Swimming Association and the Scottish Sports Council.
The initiative is the result of a re-vamp of the SASA and part of a
four-year development plan aimed at reaping rewards at the 1998
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.
An international success programme will include training camps and
access to high-level competition. The Scottish squad returned from the
first training camp in Lanzarote last week, and Canet, France, is the
likely destination for a second in July before a team competes in the
Canadian championships in August.
The new 50 metres pool in Glasgow, due to open within 18 months, is
another boost for the sport, and it is intended to make it the base for
a swimming centre of excellence. With the help of National Lottery
funding, another new pool is to be built in Inverness.
Universities also are to be encouraged to promote swimming
scholarships similar to the scheme recently introduced at Stirling,
while improved scientific back-up is another objective.
The plan, and the SSC funding, will be reviewed annually.

SCOTLAND'S Martin Heath, who qualified for his first British Open last
week, has continued a fine run of form by winning his second
world-ranking tournament in Zurich, writes Elspeth Burnside.
The 21-year-old beat Germany's Stefan Leifels by 3-0 in the final to
follow in the footsteps of Jahangir Khan, Chris Dittmar, and Jansher
Khan as title-holders.
''Because of the clash of dates with the final rounds of the British
Open, the event did not attract quite as good a field,'' said Heath, who
also has won this season's Philadelphia Open. ''But I'm delighted to
have my name on the trophy with so many greats.''
Ranked No.38 in the world, the victory also should guarantee a rise in
the next list, out in May. After having reached the last 16 of the
Portuguese Open and producing a fine display against world No.9 Del
Harris in the British event, he also has enjoyed a boost in confidence.
Heath, from Oban but now based in London, has his sights set on
further success when he heads to Le Mans today for the start of the
Oasis Classic on Friday.
Meanwhile, Martin's older brother, David, helped Strathclyde become
the first Scottish team to win the European Universities' championship
in Paris. They beat a German team in the semi-finals, and Nottingham in
the final.

MENZIESHILL'S women's side has plenty to celebrate these days for
after having won the second division on Saturday, two of their younger
players, Jamie Lyon and Hilary Twisleton, have been named in the

IN a unique agreement announced yesterday, Loch Lomond Golf Club will
provide two tee-off times each day to the Scottish Golf Union, who will
allocate them to members of affiliated clubs.
The income derived from the scheme, estimated at between #40,000 and
#50,000 a year, will be devoted to SGU coaching programmes.
The SGU president, George Gormley, said that letters outlining the new
project, which is to start on May 8, would be sent to all clubs.
Applications to play on the Tom Weiskopf-Jay Morrish designed course
would be dealt with through the union's Edinburgh office on a
first-come-first-served basis.
Douglas Rae, who, with another past president, Douglas Dalgleish, was
involved in the negotiations which led to the agreement, emphasised that
all clubs would have equal opportunities to take part. ''We don't want
back-door membership with the same golfers playing repeatedly,'' he
said.
Rae added: ''The revenue will contribute towards ensuring that the
best training is given to young players to bring them on to be the best.
To keep up with the Continental countries and compete on equal terms, we
must join them in the way they have established development
programmes.''
Paul Dellanzo, a former policeman turned professional golfer who is
the Loch Lomond club's director of operations, noted that driving ranges
and practice grounds had seldom been part of the original growth of the
game in the home of golf. ''A new game needs new facilities and coaching
practices,'' he added.
The Arizona-based owners of the club, a development company headed by
Lyle Anderson and D M B Associates, an investment company, have gained
recognition for contributions towards junior and amateur golf in
America. They were anxious to make a similar commitment in Scotland.
Scotland will play Sweden in an amateur international match at Loch
Lomond on May 1 and 2, but Dellanzo said the club was: ''not chasing
tournaments. We had overtures to host the Scottish Open and other large
events, but we are not ready for that -- neither with the course nor the
infrastructure.''
Dellanzo added: ''We don't want to be over-commercialised and the
members want to play at the peak of the season, too. Down the road,
after proper access, parking, and services are in place, we hope at some
point to stage an important event.''

THOSE of us who dip into the ball pocket of our golf bags and play the
first sphere that comes to hand might have been alarmed to read that
Nick Faldo reckons playing a ball with a higher compression than usual
may have cost him six or seven strokes over the first two rounds of the
Players' Championship at Sawgrass, Florida, last week.
Relax, though. If this is the case then the Englishman possesses a
sensitivity few can match. European Tour players Adam Hunter and Stephen
McAllister have said they would find it difficult to tell, if they
didn't know in advance, what compression of ball they were using.
Normally, three-times Open champion Faldo uses the Bridgestone
company's Rextar Balata 40s (90 compression), but due to a mix-up he
arrived on the tee and to his consternation, found he had only the
harder Balata 50s (100 compression). Compression is a measure of the
distortion when clubface meets ball, and both Scots incidentally, used
Titleist Balata 100s.
As Faldo missed the cut by four strokes last week, it would seem to
have been a disastrous error for which he cannot escape blame, even if
the balls were left in his locker by the supplier and put into his bag
by his caddie.
Responsibility rests with the player and on the European Tour, there
is no such luxury as balls delivered to players' lockers. They have to
be collected, a system which club golfers will note is still infinitely
better than buying them at #2 a time.
McAllister, a Tour regular in his eighth season and with two
tournament victories behind him, was doubtful whether the ball could
have made so much difference. ''I would hold judgment on that,'' he
said. ''I would have thought a player like Faldo could probably have
coped. There is probably a slight difference but you could not compare
it to, for example, driving a car thinking you have power steering and
then when you turn a corner, find you haven't.
''I have switched between 90s and 100s and the only difference I find
is that 100s are harder and crisper. It is more feel than anything and I
don't think there is a great deal of difference in flight or spin.''
Hunter, recent winner of the Portuguese Open, said: ''If somebody put
down a mix of 90s and 100s and they weren't marked, I would struggle to
tell which was which except, maybe, with chipping and putting. But Faldo
is such a perfectionist that he is able to feel things that other guys
can't, and if he says the change cost him seven shots, then he is
right.''
Bill Lockie, the prominent Tartan Tour player and the amateur men's
and women's national coach in Scotland, who has recently switched from
100s to 90s, also was receptive to Faldo's reasoning.
''On a course like Sawgrass, where you are looking to land the ball on
a small target area, a difference of even three yards is going to be
significant, especially to a player like Faldo who knows the exact
distance he hits the ball. It was for reasons like consistent
conditions, after all, that he went to America this year.''
Whatever the difference is between the balls, it will have to stay a
mystery for the time being. Calls to Bridgestone in both the UK and
America seeking performance statistics went unanswered this week.
It also is worth pointing out that one ball for a Tour player
generally lasts only three holes, and in one round they are not allowed
to change make, type, or compression. Unlike club golfers who have no
such restriction, the only aspect of a ball that can be changed in the
pro-game is the number.
* SCOTTISH internationalist Craig Watson, winner of the first Scottish
Mid-Amateur championship at Blairgowrie in June, will be aiming for a
unique double this summer.
The East Renfrewshire player will be attempting to claim the honour of
also being the first winner of the inaugural British Mid-Amateur event,
due to be staged at Sunningdale's new course from August 16-20.
Watson, 28, is so determined to achieve the double whammy that his
entry was the first received by the Royal and Ancient in St Andrews,
four months before the closing date of July 12.
The eventual winner also will have the chance to stake his claim for
inclusion in the Walker Cup side bound for Royal Porthcawl in September.
* THE West Alliance championship meeting for the McCondichie Quaich,
due to be played today at Windyhill and Clydebank and District, has been
postponed until next Wednesday. The same tee-off times will apply.

COMEBACKS are the stuff of Hollywood dreams. If they had not been, how
would Sylvester Stallone, via Rocky, have made so many millions of
dollars?
De guy gets to de top, blows it on booze and fast women, has a spell
in the slammer, meets God or one of his assistants, swears he will never
stray again, finds a moll with a heart of gold, has a chance to take his
old title back, is on de ropes for a spell but bounces back and lives
healthily -- and richly -- ever after.
Lights, camera, action: ''Somebody up there likes me or Tyson 2,''
coming soon on a satellite television channel near you.
It may indeed work out that way for mighty, but reformed Mike. No-one
doubts he will cash in from endorsements until he steps back into the
ring, then maybe a warm-up with a bum of the month or maybe just a
mega-buck duel with the champ old enough to be his father, George
Foreman. But it may not be like that at all.
Because for every ''one more chance'' that succeeds, there are many
others for whom coming back is a painful reminder of how much they have
forgotten,or how the years have taken their toll.
Ask Ken Buchanan or Joe Bugner or Ali, the greatest of them all, now
shuffling sadly in a world of his own.
Nor should we confine our consideration of the comebacks to boxing.
Of course, he can still ride horses well, but I am surely not alone in
regretting the sight of the once incomparable Lester Piggott waiting to
hear if he has been booked to partner some mediocre beast in a seller at
Lingfield?
Mike Gatting, despite one Test century, hardly did his reputation much
good by returning to the international scene in Australia last year. His
fielding became laughable, his batting a frail shadow.
John Emburey and Graham Gooch were other examples of cricketers who
either failed to come back or stayed around too long. Ian Botham does
not intend to make the same mistake.
Tennis, too, is littered with the dreams of those who thought they had
more titles in them. Bjorn Borg was the daftest figure, trying to play
in the modern game with equipment 20 years out of date and a body to
match.
Pat Cash, the bounciest of Australians, was much younger but still
didn't make the way back. We wait to see when or even whether Monica
Seles reappears; we know she will find a host of youngsters ready to
claim her scalp.
Sir Stanley Matthews played first-division football until into his
fifties but, significantly, without a break. ''If I had laid off for
even one season after about the age of 35, I would never have started
again,'' he has said.
David Campese, the Australian rugby winger who is expected to be one
of the personalities of this year's World Cup, has announced his
retirement several times. It's just that he never actually goes through
with it.
They say the likes of Barry John and David Sole quit rugby too early,
before either was even 30. Yet, whatever we remember about these
magnificent players it will not be of them struggling to survive against
younger opponents.
They had their moments of glory. Neither of them thought there was
better to come, so they went off to conquer new fields.
I believe sporting careers, at the very top, are going to be shorter
in future, such are the demands, both physical and mental, which are
placed on the superstars. But it is still tough to know when to stop.
Tyson, of course, did not intend to have a break, the law enforcement
officers put the TKO on him for three years. I am sure he is fit; he may
even be smarter than he once was; he will certainly not lack
determination.
I do not take any moral line about whether he is the right person to
hold a world title. If one were to apply that criteria there would be
dozens of vacancies, in many sports.
Yet before we become convinced that all he has to do is turn up to
regain the crown, we should remind ourselves that Tyson had lost his
version of the heavyweight championship before he went to jail. He is by
no means invincible.
From one of Mike's newest minders, a certain Mr Sayid Syeed, secretary
of the Islam Society of North America, came a rather curious quote. ''In
his boxing,'' he declared, ''Mike will be more humane, more
compassionate, more understanding. He will use his skills, his might in
a more cautious way.''
Oh yeah? Tell that to de boids.

A QUESTION mark hangs over the meeting at Catterick today after a
sudden drop in temperature claimed two of yesterday's meetings.
The fixtures at Newcastle and Towcester failed to raise a gallop
because of snow, and following a covering at Catterick, today's card
will only proceed if the course passes an early inspection.
''There is snow on the course,'' said clerk of the course James
Sanderson. ''It depends on what the weather does overnight and in the
morning.''
* TRAINER David Nicholson is so upset at proposals to end jump racing
at Nottingham that he has written a letter of protest to the track.
Course officials have decided to scrap National Hunt racing because
its customers prefer their action on the level.

Ross Finlay handles a lively little animal
ONE unsettled argument is whether the 1.6-litre Vauxhall Tigra
out-handles the 1.4, going hard on a winding road, or the other way
round. Some people insist that the smaller-engined version has the
advantage, but I am inclined to believe that the 1.6 is ultimately
better, although, since this is more of a ''fun'' car than a serious
sports coupe, I do not think owners will be much bothered.
The Tigra started as a concept car, along with the neat little Traka
pick-up, and appeared briefly at the last Scottish Motor Show. Vauxhall
wanted to test public reaction to it, although management had already
given the Tigra the nod, and it was well into the build-up towards full
production status. I always had a sneaking regard for the Traka, but it
has disappeared, for the moment, from view.
Vauxhall had the Corsa as a convenient platform for its first-ever
coupe, and that is why the Tigra shows up well in its showroom prices,
compared with some open two-seaters announced more recently. The
1.4-litre version costs #10,995 and the 1.6 I have been driving is on
offer at exactly #2000 more.
The familiar 1598cc engine, with a 106bhp output, gives the little
coupe a 0-60mph time of about 9.5 seconds, and a test track top speed
close to 125mph. But the Tigra is economical as well as lively. You can
expect 55mpg at 56mph, 40 at 75 and 31m pg around town.
Lighter than the Corsa, and with a lowered centre of gravity, the
Tigra feels stable on the move. It has reduced understeer and a more
sporty springing system at the rear, possible because the coupe will
only rarely carry as much passenger weight as the hatchback. In fact,
the Tigra's occasional rear seating is pretty much let's-pretend stuff
except for children. It will never have as much live weight to carry.
The wedge-shaped styling allows a very roomy front cabin -- there is
actually a tiny amount more front legroom in the Tigra than in the Corsa
-- with plenty of head clearance. Instruments and controls are from the
Corsa. One notable omission is height adjustment for the steering wheel.
Trim patterns are quite colourful, which is part of the Tigra's
hoped-for appeal, but the practicalities have not been forgotten. If you
look at the Tigra side-on, you might expect that there is no possibility
of a sunroof. But the 1.6 has an electric sunroof as standard. It will
tilt at the rear with the first pressure on the switch, and then the
whole tilted panel will slide backwards. You have to be careful about
that, because when it is at an angle any water droplets on the top
surface dribble into the passenger cabin.
Although it is a two-plus-two design, the Tigra has fair enough
luggage space behind the rear seats. It is covered by a pull-back
security blind. Folded forward, the rear seats provide extra luggage
space. One neat touch is that, even when the seats are upright, there is
a ski hatch opening.
A sporty performer as well as just a style accessory, the 1.6-litre
Tigra has what sounds like a slightly tuned-up exhaust note. This long
wheelbase coupe sits square and well balanced on the road, and handles
very securely on its low-profile tyres, although these help to harden
its ride compared with the 1.4. Ride quality on varied surfaces is,
however, well up to sports coupe standards. Like the 1995 Corsa, the
Tigra uses gas-filled shock absorbers. Anti-lock brakes are fitted to
the 1.6, and I was happy to have them when I needed to take the car on
to some slushy springtime roads.
Altogether, the Tigra is not only eye-catching but also an enjoyable
car to wheech around. Mind you, I think I caught some onlookers
wondering if I was one generation too late to be enjoying this
''lifestyle'' coupe on my own.

INTERNATIONAL cross-country running may celebrate its centenary by
returning to its birthplace on Hamilton racecourse. Scottish officials
will tonight discus the feasibility of bidding for the world
championships of 2003.
The very first international race was held at Hamilton on March 28,
1903, over an eight-mile course which led from the racecourse and
through the grounds of the Duke of Hamilton's palace.
The council of the Scottish road-running and cross-country commission
meets tonight in Glasgow, and its new secretary, Brian Goodwin,
confirmed last night that the subject will be on the agenda.
''The birthplace and a lot of history of the sport lie in Scotland,''
said Gooodwin. ''I can think of no better place for the world event to
be held 100 years on. Nor can I see any problem about our ability to
host and organise the event. Assuming the idea received approval, the
first step would be to approach the British Federation for support, and
investigate the financial implications.''
Scotland has hosted the world event five times since the Second World
War: Ayr racecourse in 1946, Hamilton in 1952 and 1960, Clydebank in
1969, and Bellahouston in 1977. The last was the only time under
International Amateur Athletic Federation jurisdiction. Irvine applied
for this year's event, but lost to Durham where British teams were
humiliated last weekend.
Hamilton, as a tried and tested venue -- it also hosted the Scottish
championships from 1928-35, and from 1950-68 -- has an accessible
international airport in Glasgow, linked directly by motorway. It has
the perfect infrastructure of suitable hotels, and far superior viewing
facilities to most recent world championship venues.
Durham city and county councils underwrote last weekend's costs to
#250,000. That included community events, including a #10,000 firework
display. ''Though final figures are not available, we will not remotely
approach the #250,000,'' said Allan Wilson, secretary of the organising
committee.
''We are carrying out a cost benefit analysis. We believe these were
substantial, and expect to be able to prove it. Apart from the money
spent by the 14,000 on-course visitors, we used the event as an
opportunity to attract inward investment.
''We staged a made-in-Durham trade fair, and had the trade consuls
from 31 nations, including Japan. The department of Trade and Industry
also held a world trade improvement convention.''
The intial response from the British Athletic Federation last night
was encouraging. ''It would be something for the UK cross-country
commission to consider,'' said spokesman Tony Ward. ''But we are keen to
host major international events, and provided the finances were assured,
I believe the suggestion would be looked on favourably.''

MOTORSPORT
FRENCH oil company Elf insisted last night that the fuel supplied to
teams for the Brazilian Grand Prix conformed to Formula One rules.
The Benetton and Williams teams have both lodged appeals after their
respective drivers, Michael Schumacher and David Coulthard, were
disqualified after the race for alleged fuel irregularities.
German world champion Schumacher finished the race in first place,
with Scotsman Coulthard second.
But Formula One's governing body, the FIA, ruled that samples of fuel
used at Sao Paulo had not matched the chemical pattern of those lodged
with them at the start of the season.
Both Benetton and Williams had already been found to have broken the
strict fuel regulations during practice and qualifying in Brazil and the
two teams were each fined #20,000.
However, the Paris-based oil company said in a statement: ''The fuels
used in the Brazilian Grand Prix by the seven teams Elf supplies
rigorously respected the rules.'' Five of the teams Elf supply were not
found to have been using the wrong fuel.
Elf urged the two teams to demand that the FIA send them details of
the tests.

BOTH the new British Slalom Champions laid their personal ghosts to
rest in spectacular style as racing finally got under way at The British
Land British National Ski Championships in Tignes, France, yesterday.
Marjory Adam, from Falkirk, was denied a certain title last year just
four gates from the finish when she straddled a slalom pole. But she is
back in the British women's FIS team and yesterday she skied a mature,
confident race to win both runs and lift the women's title.
Nottingham's Adam Sullivan lifted the men's title after first-run
leader Sean Langmuir (Aviemore) was disqualified for straddling a gate.
0 Sullivan suffered a cruciate-ligament ankle injury while playing
volleyball on a day lost to the weather at these championships last
year. It kept him out of skiing for seven months and put paid to his
British team place after four years' success on the team.
With so much loose, new snow on the Lognan race slope, organisers had
to work throughout each of the four heats to keep the tracks in
reasonable order. Their work was prompted by the condition of the first
women's course, as five leading British team women -- including top
seeds Emma Carrick-Anderson and Sandra Wilson -- failed to complete the
first heat.
Adam, who is in the second year of a sports scholarship at Stirling
University, said: ''It's unfortunate that the other girls all skied out
because I'd have much preferred a straight race, but I can't help
that.'' Results:
Women: 1, Marjory Adam (Stirling Univ) 41.23sec, 40.51, total 1-21.74;
2, Sophie Ormond (Grand Bornand/UK) 43.51, 42.25, 1-25.76; 3, Kirsteen
McGibbon (Glasgow) 44.39, 42.19, 1-26.58; 4, Emily Hunt (St Albans)
47.49, 43.17, 1-30.06; 5, Katy Liddell (Aberdeen) 48.01, 43.72, 1-31.73.
Men: 1, Adam Sullivan (Nottingham) 43.02, 50.03,  1-33.05; 2, Spencer
Pession (Brighton) 43.21, 49.88, 1-33.09; 3, James Ormond (Grand
Bornand/UK 43.29, 49.95, 1-33.24; 4, Finlay Mickel (KPMG Scottish Team/
Edinburgh) 44.81, 51.63, 1-36.56; 5, Roger Hughes (Gwnedd, Wales) 45.88,
51.48, 1-37.36; 6, Dan Walker (Witney, Oxford) 45.26, 52.96, 1-38.22; 7,

''JUMP on the bandwagon -- it'll be a good ride,'' said head coach
Larry Kuharich when the Scottish Claymores arrived in Edinburgh
yesterday from their pre-season training camp in Atlanta.
Four new Scottish players, who have just been named to join the team
by coach Kuharich, were there to greet the others. They are wide
receiver/defensive back Andy Meikle from Pilessie, Fife, linebacker Paul
Balfour from Glasgow, running back Darren Chapman from Aberdeen, and
offensive linesman Gerard Colquhoun from Perth.
They join Scott Couper, Derek Noble, and Ben Torriero, the Scots who
kept their places following the training camp.
Couper and Torriero were highly praised by Kuharich when he spoke at a
news conference at Edinburgh airport. ''They are two of the best
students of the game as well as fine players, and Scott is an excellent
receiver -- when we practise, we just go,'' said Kuharich, who is
naturally upbeat after coming through all the training games unbeaten.
The four bring the number of Scots back up to seven, something the
critics said was impossible. ''They told us we could never get seven
Scottish players and that we'd be really pushed to get three,'' said
general manager Sandy Waters.
''But we're delighted with the mental toughness that our Scottish
players have shown in going to the USA and playing against American
players at their own cultural game and producing the goods.''
He made a strong appeal for the public to get behind the side. ''We
represent Scotland in the World League and each game is an international
-- it's a unique situation.''
According to Waters, tickets are going well for the home games, which
start a week on Sunday (April 9) at Murrayfield with a game against the
Dusseldorf team, Rhein Fire.
''Naturally, we'd like to sell more, and now that we have the team
here it will definitely help us.
''This is a stand-out team coming through -- it's just not done by
anyone to go through all the pre-season games unbeaten. We can go out
and play with anybody.''
Allen DeGraffenreid, the 6ft 2in, 15-stone wide receiver formerly with
the Kansan City Chiefs in the NFL, described his team-mates as ''the
roughest, toughest bunch of guys you would ever be likely to meet,'' and
certainly there will be a few eyebrows raised in Princes Street in the
coming weeks when this team hits town.

A CAREFULLY developed discipline lies behind much of the steady growth
of the Ogilvie Group's activities across more and more of Central
Scotland.
''Our financial policy is to expand in a controlled and planned
fashion,'' said Mr Duncan Ogilvie, chief executive of the Ogilvie Group.
''Each step is thoroughly planned in advance. Profits are retained --
and you have to make profits to retain them.
''Acquiring BS5750 is an investment in the future for Ogilvie
Builders, for Mogil Motors and for our third arm, Ogilvie Management
Services. It is part of our planned expansion for the years ahead in the
Scottish commercial scene. We see it as very much part of our needs in a
quality culture.''
Ronnie Cheape considers that as a company they are now ready to expand
as required into areas further afield.
New conditions within the building industry in general have brought
their own changes. The Ogilvie Group now generates some 20% of their own
construction and building work and last year sold over 90 new-built
houses.
He also admits that people outside the industry are amazed at the size
and scope of the Ogilvie Group's activities and to the extent to which
it is firmly established in Scotland.
''We see our success in each of our companies as being the result of
an acute awareness of market needs and also of the way in which we are
always ready to try to anticipate and to respond to change.
Similar attitudes prevail in the sister organisation Mogil Motors,
which provide full Ford sales and service facilities within its Stirling
and Dumfries franchise areas.
Ogilvie building projects range from local authority contracts to
commercial developments of every kind.
''We aim at successful completion within time and budget constraints
and to achieve sound workmanship to the highest standards,'' said Ronnie
Cheape. ''One thing is certain. There is never any compromise in
quality. It has been that way now for 50 years and that is how it will
stay!''

THE prosperous Ogilvie Group has grown steadily from very modest
beginnings.
Two Stirling brothers, Jack and Duncan Ogilvie, first set up in
business on their own as jobbing builders in 1945. Within a few years
their activities had grown considerably and by 1953 they had become a
limited company.
Early success as they graduated to general building was followed by a
sustained period of further growth while carrying out a programme of
construction of bonded warehouses for DCL.
Growth of a different variety took place in 1969 when the Ogilvie firm
acquired the well-established Millers garage business in Stirling, which
had been a Ford dealership since 1945. The garage business, which also
celebrates its 50th anniversary of Ford main dealership this year, was
re-named Mogil Motors, a name derived from a combination of Miller and
Ogilvie.
The present Ogilvie group was established in 1985 and has its
headquarters in a modern office block at Whins of Milton. In typical
style, as the office premises are now being expanded, plans are under
way at the same time to build a small business and industrial park next
door by developing much of the rest of the available eight-acre
location.
Recent expansions include the setting up of Ogilvie Homes Ltd, a
speculative house building company, in 1986. Earlier, in 1974, Mogil
Motors had also expanded by taking over an existing Ford dealership in
the Dumfries area which now trades as Mogil (Dumfries). The Dumfries
dealership is now working towards BS5750 quality accreditation.
The other very active member of the group, Ogilvie Management Services
Ltd, was set up last year. It operates in three areas. There is a large
car and van fleet contract hire division, there is an adult training
division for the unemployed, which works to contracts from enterprise
companies, and the third, telecommunications, division handles Toshiba
telephone communication systems.
The main group turnover is split almost equally between its two
principal arms, construction and the motor trade.
Mr Duncan Ogilvie, a grandson of one of the two original builder
brothers, is chief executive of the group and a majority shareholder in
an enterprise which remains a family business.
The Ogilvie group motto is Born in Scotland, Growing in Scotland.
Staff loyalty is strong. Ogilvie Builders include many workers who are
second generation. At Mogil, over 50% of the staff have been there for
more than 20 years.

THE Ogilvie Group, the prominent family-owned and Stirling-based
builders and vehicles sales concern, will celebrate its 50th anniversary
this year.
With a #50m turnover, the group plans steady continued growth over the
next 50 years.
Although not planned as part of the golden jubilee celebration, the
group has also achieved a remarkable treble in terms of quality
accreditation.
At the same time as Ogilvie Builders has achieved BS5750 part two and
ISO9002, similar success has been achieved by the sister company Mogil
Motors Ltd, the Ford dealership located in Stirling. One of the newest
companies within the group, Ogilvie Management Services, has also
achieved BS5750 standard for its telecommunications division and has
been awarded SQMS certification for its adult training division.
''We are delighted at the successes,'' said Mr Duncan Ogilvie, chief
executive of the Ogilvie Group, and a member of the main Ogilvie board.
''As builders, our progression towards achieving BS5750 accreditation
through TRADA -- the Timber Research and Development Association -- took
a period of two years.
''We began the process and the considerable work it entailed for quite
simple reasons. We thought we needed to do it to improve our quality
control, with potential efficiency benefits, and also because a number
of our customers had begun inquiring whether we were going to go along
that path.''
Mr Ronnie Cheape, managing director of Ogilvie Homes, started off on
the BS5750 path with a suspicion that achieving accreditation would be
more difficult for a building firm than for many other concerns.
''We were operating on some 20 or so building sites with all the
obvious problems involved, including weather, as opposed to a firm
operating under one factory roof.''
A senior member of staff, Mr George Marshall, was appointed quality
manager and the process began with introductory seminar sessions for
staff.
In some work areas only a degree of ''fine tuning'' was required. But
new procedures in other areas included the establishment of ''quarantine
zones'' at all construction sites. Any rejected materials were labelled
as Goods Not To Be Used and were later removed.
''Much of what we are doing may at first glance seem to be fairly
similar to what was done before. But it is now being fully inspected and
audited,'' said Ronnie Cheape. ''Without doubt the end result is that
the quality of our product has measurably improved.''
Mogil Motors took their accreditation path for reasons which were in
part similar but also because it was being strongly recommended by the
Ford Motor Company. Their accreditation progress was through Churchgate
Accreditation.
''From the start we found that many of the proposed practices for the
required new quality manual were already in place,'' said Mogil
financial director Robert McIntyre. He has with the Stirling dealership
for 34 years, starting as office manager with its previous owners
Millers.
''Then we discovered that some of the required procedures had been in
place at one time in the past then had simply ceased to being applied 10
to 15 years previously. Added again, and placed alongside further new
procedures, they are now mandatory.''
''Like our builder colleagues, we always had checklists. But a
checklist is now something to be signed on each item by the individual
involved to show that he carried out that work. When a problem arises,
it is now much easier to locate what happened, what went wrong -- and to
tune things further to prevent it happening again.''
The prized BS5750 certificates were presented to group chief executive
Duncan Ogilvie by Mr Michael Heseltine when Mr Heseltine was on a visit
to Stirling.
''BS5750 is not in itself any kind of final objective,''said Ronnie
Cheape. ''It is intended to be improved upon and that is exactly what we
are now doing.''

CELEBRITY cooks choose their home kitchen appliances based on
experience, so it follows that a quick look round an expert's kitchen
can give you ideas.
Cookery writer and TV presenter Sophie Grigson set out to create a
comfortable look in her kitchen by filling the shelves with antique
plates and utensils, but she has also made sure the room is a place to
work in. Her ideal kitchen would be the size of a small playing field,
but the kitchen in her London home is quite small.
In practice, the lack of space has not been a problem, but Sophie
finds bending to see into the oven-housed grill a major inconvenience.
A Candy lava grill built into the work surface has provided a
solution. A bit like a barbecue, but with lava instead of charcoal and
an electric element above, the worktop grill can be used to cook
everything from toast to grilled meat, fish and peppers.
Finding a versatile appliance which fits with your style of cooking is
easier than ever now, because there are so many new products.
There's much more to buying a new hob than just choosing between gas
rings and electric hotplates.
Now there are gas burners that cut out automatically when the lid is
closed; easy to clean pan supports which will fit easily into the
dishwasher, and different power settings for simmering and boiling. The
latest development for gas hobs is rotating burners, which revolve
slowly so that the flame gradually works its way round the base of the
pan.
New technology means that ovens, like most other domestic appliances,
have changed a lot in recent years. Before you choose a new oven, try to
think about what you really need -- if you prefer to grill, fry or boil
food, then a worktop barbecue grill might be a better buy than a double
oven. Gas ovens are most popular with professional cooks, because they
cook in a moist environment, so food is less likely to dry out. Gas
ovens work in three ways -- some are directly heated with burners at the
back forcing heat upwards, so that the top of the oven is hotter and the
bottom cooler. Fan assisted gas ovens provide an even temperature
throughout so that food can be cooked evenly.
New multi-function electric ovens have features like fans with no heat
for defrosting; fans with top or bottom heat only, to create cooler
areas in the oven; automatic cooking that allows you to pre-set
temperature and cooking time and a microwave function for use on its own
or combined with electric heat. Newest of all are steam ovens, still
quite expensive because of their novelty, but a healthy and efficient
way of cooking.
Cleaning the oven is no longer the chore it once was. With pyrolitic
cleaning, the oven heats up to about 500C, reducing stains and spills to
fine ash, which can be wiped away once the oven has cooled. If you have
cheaper off-peak electricity, you can set the timer to clean the oven
when fuel costs are lowest. There are also ovens with stay-clean liners
-- stains burn off at normal temperatures.
When you choose cookers, dishwasher and fridge-freezers, consider
whether you want freestanding appliances or whether slip-in or build-in
models will suit you best. If your purchase of new appliances is part of
a kitchen re-fit, call in a reputable professional firm to build a new
kitchen which will be practical and enjoyable.
If you have children, you may especially enjoy looking round the new
Concept Kitchens showroom in East Kilbride shopping centre -- there's a
miniature kitchen where small cooks can be quietly busy while their
parents look round. As well as being style conscious, Concept Kitchens
are cash conscious, the provision of value for money being high on their
list of priorities.
Ingenious appliances, good basic design and quality kitchen units will
ensure that your kitchen functions smoothly. Most large manufacturers
are now energy conscious, and rate their appliances for efficiency.
Ozone-damaging CFCs will be phased out by 1996. But some of the
replacements are less efficient -- you can be environmentally friendly
without much energy loss, so check the label on appliances -- the
Department of Energy gives a grading from one to ten, the higher the
grading, the more efficient the appliance.

''PEOPLE are constantly surprised at how many garments they can get
for their money at Q Mark,'' says Jackie McMorris.
The public perception of retailing she feels, has changed
substantially in recent times. ''Now, people wait for the sales, knowing
prices will drop, and they have become used to out-of-town discount
stores too. There's been so much publicity about American concepts such
as CostCo which have come over here, people now make a point of
searching out places like Q Mark.
''In Glasgow, we are fortunate to have car parking for more than 90
cars. In Edinburgh, people have to use the surrounding meters. It
doesn't seem to worry them, however, and we are close enough to the city
centre for customers to walk or take a taxi.''
The Glasgow Q Mark has quickly built up to, and indeed exceeded, its
expectations. Glaswegian women are noted to be more willing to try new
ideas than their sisters in Edinburgh, who tend to favour more
conservative styles.
Mrs McMorris says it is commonplace for both men and women to visit Q
Mark as often as once a fortnight, to keep abreast of what's new. ''Once
we put across the concept of the privilege card, and people realise the
savings they make on the garments, they come in regularly because
there's always something fresh to look at. On the other hand, some
people will come along only once or twice a year.
''As long as customers feel they're getting a benefit out of being a
member of Q Mark privilege shopping club, it's fine by us either way,''
she smiles. ''Many people come in and check what we have available
before they go to the chain stores. The ones who get most frustrated,
are those who've already bought something at full price, then come in
and see it at Q Mark at substantially less cost.''
Last autumn, Q Mark held evening fashion shows in their Glasgow and
Edinburgh warehouses, and there are plans to repeat these. Charity
fashion shows, where the entry money is given to the charity concerned,
have been held often, as have charity shopping evenings. At these, the
charity invites perhaps 200 people along for an evening's shopping, with
Q Mark giving 10% of the takings to the charity.
Late night shopping is Thursday in both cities -- 7pm in Edinburgh and
8pm in Glasgow, is closing time on such evenings. Otherwise, weekdays
and Saturdays, see the Glasgow shop open 9am-6pm, with the Edinburgh
shop closing at 5.30pm. From Sunday, April 2, shoppers in the capital
will be able to visit Q Mark every Sunday, between 12 noon and 5pm,
which will bring it into line with the Glasgow store.

EVERYONE loves a bargain. The thought of being able to buy famous High
Street retailers' clothes for men, women and children, at heavily
discounted prices, is hugely appealing... and that's what Q Mark is all
about.
From today (March 29) until Sunday, April 9, a Spring promotion means
that bargain hunters will be in for even more of a bonanza than usual,
with 20% off all stock marked with a green ticket. This could mean total
savings on Q Mark's normal prices of up to 50-60%.
But what exactly is Q Mark all about? Who is eligible to buy there,
and how are they able to discount their goods so substantially?
Ian and Jackie McMorris set up their company eight years ago in
Edinburgh, expanding into Glasgow's south side three years ago. Jackie
McMorris explains: ''Manufacturers may have over-produced some of their
ranges, or orders may have been cancelled by a chain store for various
reasons, so they are left with the stock. They obviously can't keep
stock-piling garments, so they sell on to companies like Q Mark -- the
only thing is, we are not allowed to sell them with the retailer's label
intact, so these have to be removed. The vast majority of our
merchandise is perfect, we do have some seconds, but often the flaws are
barely discernible.''
Now, who can buy from Q Mark?
By using the Free Day coupon at the foot of this page, anyone can take
the opportunity to buy without the need to purchase a privilege card
during the promotion period. Normally though, the idea is that members
of the public buy a Q Mark privilege card for #5, valid for one year.
This makes them eligible to purchase at either of the company's
warehouses, as often as they like.
With space for two signatories, a family may use a card, or one person
and a friend -- the only stipulation is that when a purchase is made,
the card must be produced.
All this, however, does not preclude any member of the public
interested in seeing what Q Mark has to offer, going into one of their
warehouses to browse and decide whether or not it interests them. Anyone
is welcome to pop in and have a look around -- if you then decide you'd
like to purchase, all you need do is buy a privilege card at the
counter, which gives instant membership of the club.
Each store is always packed with garments. In winter there is a good
selection of men's and women's outerwear, from coats and seven-eighths
coats, to jackets and raincoats, while all year round there is a
tremendous choice of separates for every member of the family, as well
as sportswear, leisurewear, underclothes and nightwear, for both sexes.
The prices shown on all merchandise are ex-VAT, therefore, VAT at
17[1/2]% is added to every item bought, at point of sale. Notices
throughout the stores give examples of basic prices, what the VAT
element will be, then the total amount payable, so that people can see
exactly what their purchase will cost them in full.
In addition to garments, Q Mark -- in particular in Edinburgh --
carries limited ranges of household textiles, especially towels. There
are some excellent bargains to be had, from luxurious velours to some
very good buys in beach towels for the holidays. Shoppers will also find
a number of homeware items, again easily recognisable as the products of
leading chain stores.
As far as prices are concerned, Jackie McMorris cites a good average
for ladies' jackets as #29.99, while a typical blouse and skirt will be
around #15.95 and #16.95 respectively -- all of course, plus VAT.
''It is possible to find clothes which are more budget-priced than
ours,'' she declares, ''but they are not of the same quality. The ones I
have described, are recognised as chain store lines, you can see them on
the rails of High Street shops -- at considerably higher prices. For the
quality of the clothes, our prices offer great reductions.''
When it comes to menswear, there's also an excellent selection of
shirts. ''We do labelled shirts,'' explains Mrs McMorris. ''We're
allowed to retain labels for Double Two and Rael Brook for example. A
lot of businessmen come in and buy their shirts from us, they represent
great value and there's always lots of choice.''
Q Mark's stock is bought from all over the UK, the vast majority of it
British in origin. There are occasions, however, when merchandise will
come from a foreign manufacturer, often the result of an order having
been cancelled, perhaps because of late delivery. Whatever, it adds up
to exciting opportunities for the public.

DUNDEE-based convenience stores chain Morning Noon &amp; Night yesterday
announced a 21% increase in sales to #14.2m in the year to March 25.
Chief executive Eddie Thompson said he expected audited figures, due
in two months' time, to reveal that profit growth has significantly
outstripped that of turnover.
On a like-for-like basis, discounting the acquisition of four
additional stores during the year, sales were up 12%.
The advent of the National Lottery has provided a boost, with weekly
ticket sales in ''live'' in-store outlets, on which Morning Noon &amp; Night
receives 5% commission, averaging #5000.
However, the spin-off effect is more significant for the business,
with grocery sales 7% higher in stores where tickets are on sale.
In the year to March 1994, Morning Noon &amp; Night, which began trading
four years ago, achieved a 96% increase in operating profit to #233,000.

ONCE again, Ken Currie's work is intelligent, forthright, moving, and
profoundly political. It is also extremely beautiful. The harrowing nine
studies of Physician have to be seen properly to be appreciated. Doktor
is a charcoal and pastel drawing of a disillusioned, middle-aged man.
Looking closely however, the way the paper has been worked and reworked,
with the scrubbings standing up in lumps on the surface, creates a
richness of texture more like a painting than a drawing. And the series
of anguished heads in beeswax, dribbled over maps of the Balkans,
manages to be both aesthetically and politically sensitive.
The impact of many of the works is derived from half-remembered
religious imagery. The format of Triptych: Bread and Soup resembles a
Gothic altarpiece, with the central panel devoted to a bed-ridden
patient while the blood-red soup and the bread carry overtones of the
Mass. Similarly Swaddled Infant is modelled on Currie's daughter but the
quaint title and the glow emanating from the serious-looking child make
her appearance other-worldly.
Sex in Scotland is both touching and a fine opportunity to display a
virtuoso technique for painting sagging, sun-starved flesh. It is also
informative about our national predilections: apparently socks are de
rigueur. Generally, however, the exhibition is uncompromising, with few
glimpses of levity. Currie's social commitment means it is his
subject-matter above all which demands reflection. Paradoxically, the
sheer strength and variety of his technical skills at times threatens to
distract our attention.

VINCENT FRIEL! Calling Vincent Friel! Get your ass down to the
Ramshorn and sue the goddam' pants off the Strathclyde Theatre Group
now. If performances could be copywrit then Friel, who performed so
memorably in The Arches production of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross,
would be in for some compensation, as Thomas Gemmell's interpretation of
Bobby Gould, in STG's presentation of Mamet's satire on Hollywood owes
more than a passing nod to Friel.
Gemmell adopts wholesale Friel's particularly idiosyncratic style,
which was all staccato aggression, quick-draw finger pointing, and a
bizarre American accent laced heavily with Hispanic.
Friel, with his panther-like stature and swarthy appearance, carried
it off well but it sits very uncomfortably on the slight frame and pale
skin/red hair of Gemmell.
If the same principle was applied Robert De Niro would be collecting a
few bucks from Nav Lancio, who plays producer Charlie Fox. Fox is
attempting to sell his buddy Bobby a sure-fire script and the play
focuses on the hyperactive negotiations between the two but Gemmell and
Lancio fail to realise the pungent power of Mamet's caustic dialogue as
both seem too preoccupied with their surface impersonations.
The action gains conviction only in the final scene, as Gould becomes
a modern-day Faust, trapped in a dilemma of conscience, between the
entreaties of his temp secretary Karen plugging an idealistic movie and
the cynical Fox, who snarls the perfect summation of Hollywood whoredom:
''If you can't tell me in a sentence they can't put it in a TV guide.''

IT was just a simple boardroom coup -- the only question is why it did
not come sooner. Pressure for change had become intolerable after Dawson
International issued a profits warning earlier this month. The
combination of non-executive directors Ronald Alexander, the formidable
Ann Burdus and Dawson's chairman as of Monday night Derek Finlay and
major institutions forced the resignations of chairman Sir Ronald Miller
and managing director Nick Kuenssberg.
A change in management was essential because Dawson was wide open to a
takeover bid.
The warning was the last straw for some investors because Dawson had
raised #45.4m through a rights issue last May. That was partly on the
basis of a promise to get out of the loss-making US shower curtain
business. That pledge, however, was reversed a few weeks later when the
company decided to try to make a go of what is an extremely difficult
business it had been unable to sell. Yet on March 3, it became evident
it was up for sale again.
Sir Ronald was on a two-year contract with emoluments in the 1993-94
financial year of #210,000 while Mr Kuenssberg had a three-year
agreement of just over #185,000. The total compensation package for the
two will be around #650,000. Mr Kuenssberg will receive the lion's share
''in mitigation'' because it is felt that his appointment as managing
director just 11 months ago ''was a mistake.''
There is one consolation in that the business is basically sound and
able to withstand the current problems. The new management team is
experienced and sagacious enough to bring about a medium-term reversal
in its fortunes. New chairman Derek Finlay, 62, has impeccable
credentials.
He was director of corporate development at H
J Heinz under Tony O'Reilly until 1993 and he sat on the Dawson board
from 1990. The food company is concerned with branding above all else,
and Mr Finlay's experience in this area is essential for promoting
Dawson, whose reputation lies with the Pringle, Joseph Dawson,
Ballantyne and other group international labels. The appointment of
Peter Forrest as managing director is a good sign. He has vast
international knowledge of the textiles industry and is currently
chairman of the cashmere subsidiaries.
Dawson is forecasting pre-tax profits before exceptional losses this
year of at least #23m and is maintaining the final dividend at a minimum
of 1.5p. There will be exceptional costs of #10m arising from closure of
the Pringle factory in Arbroath as a result of the weakness in unbranded
knitwear. Pringle will make a loss in the second half attributed to the
slump in demand in Germany because of the mild winter and general margin
pressure. Nine shops in Germany and three in Britain are being closed.
The carpet operations see closure in Kilwinning with its output
concentrated in Kilmarnock and Cumnock -- the problem is the lack of
interest in quality carpets.
Industry observers suggest that Dawson has lost its way through having
too many labels and diversification out of its traditional knitwear into
clothing -- something which will be rectified.
Dawson Home Products, the biggest shower curtain business in the US,
remains in loss. It is expected to realise less than its $50m (#32m) net
assets while there are about $20m of apparel assets also for disposal.
Any losses with these two will be added to the #10m of exceptional
charges so it looks as if Dawson will end up with pre-tax profits of
around #10m compared with last year's #95.4m loss including #106m of
reorganisation costs.
The shares recovered 4[1/2]p to 104p where they yield 3.6% on the
on-going 3p dividend total.
It is good that some surgery has been performed at the top level of
the group -- but one is left with the feeling it could have been done
several months earlier and with less personal pain all round.

TAYLOR Woodrow shares slid 7[1/2]p to 115[1/2]p after a second glance
at apparently good 1994 results disclosed several disappointments.
Headline pre-tax profits jumped 68% to #50.8m but that was after the
inclusion of an #8m surplus on the sale of shares in Eurotunnel. That
meant that the construction side of the group overall lost #4m with
profits overseas more than offset by deteriorating UK conditions.
However, Taylor Woodrow is in good financial fettle with gearing under
21%. The dividend total has been raised 50% to 2.25p with a 1.5p final.
Net assets increased from 128p to 133p per share.

AHEAD of publication today of its annual results, Coats Viyella has
disclosed that it is selling its yarns and fabrics business for #89.4m
in a management buy-out, writes NICOLA REEVES.
The disposal, the intention of which was announced last November, was
anticipated by the market and the shares dropped 4p to 190p.
The company acquiring the businesses, Newco, has been set up by
members of the existing management team with funds provided by Legal &amp;
General Ventures. Jim Harrison, head of the Yarns and Fabrics division
will be Newco's chief executive. The management will hold an initial 15%
of Newco's share capital while Coats Viyella has agreed to acquire a 19%
shareholding. Coats Viyella is reinvesting #12.5m of its sale proceeds
in loan notes issued by Newco.
Commenting on the sale, Neville Bain, group chief executive of Coats
Viyella said that a strategic decision has been taken to focus
management and financial resources on thread, fashion retail, clothing,
engineering, and homewares.
Although several offers were made for different parts of the business
Mr Bain said it was decided that it would be in the best interests of
Coats, the businesses, employees and customers if they were kept
together.
In the year to 31 December 1994, the yarns and fabrics division had a
turnover of #283.9m and an operating profit of #15m. Its net assets were
#111m. Coats' annual profits will show an exceptional loss of #40m
relating to the disposal. Overall, headline profits are expected to be
flat but underlying profits should advance a fifth to #153m.
Altogether the sale of the Yarns and Fabrics division and the carpets
division have raised #108.4m for Coats.

HE British Wool Marketing Board has dropped a court action it launched
two years ago to prevent an Alexandria-based wool merchant, J&amp;W Greig,
from buying wool direct from Scottish farmers.
A proof hearing should have taken place in the Court of Session in
Edinburgh last week but the board decided to concede Greig's right to
act as an agent for a foreign buyer. It also agreed to meet Greig's
expenses for a three-day preliminary hearing in October last year.
In a statement last night, however, the board indicated that it had
not dropped its opposition in principle to Greig operating as a buyer
outwith the board's purchase scheme. The situation would be fully
discussed at a board meeting tomorrow and ''it is expected that the
board will take appropriate action to counter this threat''.
Greig now sees itself as free to act as an agent for the Portuguese
subsidiary of an English firm of carpet manufacturers, Brintons Carpets.
Mr John King, managing director of J&amp;W Greig, said his company was
ready to buy wool in accordance with the terms of his company's agency
agreement with Brintons Portugal.
Scottish sheep farmers would have greater freedom and choice in
marketing and maximising the return from their wool clip, he said. ''I
can confirm we will be buying wool on behalf of our principal, not J&amp;W
Greig.
''It seems strange to us that the Government should continue to
support a system under which we, as wool merchants, are allowed to
purchase wool direct from UK producers on behalf of foreign buyers,
while we are prohibited from purchasing direct, from the same wool
producers, on behalf of UK buyers.''
It was in June 1993 at the Royal Highland Show that Greig first
intimated its intention to buy direct from Scottish farmers. The
following month the British Wool Marketing Board won an interim
interdict preventing it from proceeding on that basis. In October a
Southern Irish firm, Texacloth, began buying wool direct from Scottish
farmers. It later confirmed that some of that wool was being used in
English carpet mills.
As agents Greig will be responsible for the collection, grading,
sorting, packing and shipping of wool for Brintons. Payments will be
made direct to farmers by Brintons Portugal, 21 days after the uplift of
wool. Once uplifted the wool will be transported to Brintons Portugal
premises in Eire.

A NEW scheme aimed at reducing sheep numbers on heather moorland was
announced by the Scottish Office yesterday -- one day after conservation
bodies expressed concern at overgrazing in their evidence to a Scottish
Affairs Committee hearing on the future for Scottish agriculture.
Under the Heather Moorland Scheme announced by agriculture minister
Sir Hector Monro, payments will be made to farmers and crofters who
enter a five-year agreement to reduce sheep numbers and improve moorland
management.
The payment rate will be #25 a year for each ewe removed from the
flock -- if it would normally have qualified for a Hill Livestock
Compensatory Allowance payment.
Sir Hector said that heather moorland was widely recognised as a
valuable resource both in conservation and economic terms. Excessive
grazing could cause damage to a habitat on which a number of species of
wildlife depended.
The new scheme was the final part of the Scottish Office's
Agri-Environment Programme, he said, and would provide farmers with the
opportunity to adopt more extensive farming practices and manage their
moorland in a way which would contribute to the protection and
improvement of the landscape.
Applicants for the scheme must enter at least 20 hectares of heather
moorland and agree to reduce their flock to an agreed stocking level.

THE United Kingdom Agricultural Supply Trade Association (UKASTA) has
put its weight behind the campaign to save BBC Radio Scotland's daily
farming news programme, which is about to be axed.
The programme, which goes out at 12.20pm five days a week, provided an
extremely valuable service to the entire farming industry in Scotland,
said UKASTA director-general Jim Reed.
''Surely just 10 minutes of broadcasting daily is not too much to ask
for an industry the size of Scottish farming,'' he said.
''We are fully behind NFUS president John Ross in his efforts to save
the service and are writing to the controller of BBC Scotland, John
McCormick, and BBC director-general John Birt requesting them to
reconsider the decision as a matter of urgency.''

SHARES of building materials group Marley dipped 11[1/2]p to 122[1/2]p
yesterday as the company announced a #51.8m cash-call to shareholders to
help finance the purchase for #87.7m of Syroco Inc, the market leader in
the growing US casual resin furniture market.
Marley, which bounced back into the black last year, producing a
pre-tax profit of #58.7m after a #2m loss in 1993, is offering
shareholders one new share for every six held at 112p each. The rights
issue will be fully underwritten by S G Warburg and Credit Lyonnais. The
rest of the purchase price will come from the company's existing banking
facilities.
Acquiring Syroco is regarded as a significant step in Marley's
strategy of developing further its plastics processing interests. After
the purchase, plastic and resin products are expected to account for
more than two-thirds of group operating profits through the building
cycle.
Syroco, which made profits of $15.7m (#9.7m) in 1994 and whose net
assets amounted to #53.2m on December 31, is expected to have a slightly
dilutive effect on Marley's earnings per share in 1995, but a positive
effect in 1996 and thereafter.
Marley's strategy of building up this side of its business has meant
that profits from its plastics activities, including automotive
components, have grown by an average annual rate of more than 15% in the
last five years, increasing from 38% of the group's operating profits
(excluding properties) in 1989 to 71% in 1994. During this period, which
included a trough in the building cycle, operating margins from the
plastics business averaged more than 9% compared to approximately 2% in
concrete and clay products which are more exposed to the building
products cycle.
David Trapnell, chief executive of Marley, said: ''Plastic processing
is one of Marley's core strengths. Syroco uses technology and materials
familiar to us and common logistical and marketing channels. The
acquisition will allow Marley to develop from a closely related market
in the US with good growth prospects.''

NET mortgage lending by major banks fell to #597m last month from
#654m in January, the British Bankers' Association said yesterday.
''February saw the third 0.5% rise in base rates in the last six
months, and although mortgage rates have not generally risen by the full
amount, it is clear that confidence in the housing market remains low,''
said BBA director-general Tim Sweeney.
''With a further reduction in mortgage interest relief imminent, it is
perhaps surprising that lending has not been more depressed, yet major
British banks' net lending is still managing to grow at an annual rate
of nearly 7%.''

SCOTTISH Amicable yesterday announced 14 branch closures -- mainly in
England -- to make costs which must now be disclosed to purchasers of
financial products more palatable.
The life giant has also uncovered mis-selling of pensions by its own
300-strong salesforce -- in terms of the strict criteria laid down by
the recently established Personal Investment Authority.
However, this has nothing to do with the restructuring, which is
expected to give rise to between 150 and 200 redundancies.
Managing director Roy Nicolson said the compensation which Scottish
Amicable would have to pay, relating mainly to inadequate advice on
pension transfers, was relatively insignificant.
He added: ''Any company that transacts pensions would not be telling
the truth if they said they would have no compensation to pay.''
The PIA now requires disclosure to customers of salesmen's
remuneration or commission and also of the company's expenses.
Stressing that the restructuring was a positive move aimed at growth,
which, Scottish Amicable projects, will be achieved this year, Mr
Nicolson said: ''The life companies which are going to do well in the
future are the ones with a lower cost base.
''Scottish Amicable has a good reputation. We are very cost-effective
but we want to maintain that reputation.''
The life company is not changing the commission paid to salesmen.
Scottish Amicable currently has 35 branch sales offices -- 28 of them
in the independent financial adviser sector with the remainder staffed
by its own appointed representatives.
The 14 branch closures, with the exception of Belfast and Hamilton,
are south of the Border. A new sales office is being established at
Scottish Amicable's joint head office at Craigforth in Stirling.
Sales administration operations will be removed from all but the seven
regional sales support centres which will be part of the new 22-strong
branch network. These regional centres will be at Craigforth,
Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Chelmsford, Croydon and Reading.
As a result of the move, Scottish Amicable's salesforce will be
reduced by about 60, with about 80 sales administration staff going.
With some employees not wanting to move, the number of redundancies
could be slightly greater.
Craigforth will become the administration base for sales by Scottish
IFAs and by appointed representatives nationally.
The 22 staff affected by the closure of the Hamilton branch, and the
relocation of administration work from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow,
will be invited to move to Craigforth. Within Scotland, total jobs will
actually increase by between 15 and 20.
Scottish Amicable, which has mutual status and currently employs about
2300 people, faces competition in Glasgow from Abbey National Life, set
up in addition to Scottish Mutual when Abbey took it over.
NatWest Life and Halifax Life have recently entered the fray, with
retailer Marks &amp; Spencer having designs on the unit trust market and
Richard Branson's Virgin expanding into personal equity plans.
Scottish Amicable will also restructure its Glasgow and Stirling head
offices, making some layers of management more specialist in nature.

LORD Macfarlane has a reputation for turning in vintage performances
at the Glasgow-based packaging group which bears his name.
The 1994 results were no exception. Macfarlane Group (Clansman)
increased its pre-tax profits by 28.1% to a record #16.3m. Shareholders
are being rewarded with a 22.4% increase in dividends and a one-for-two
free bonus issues of shares.
The stock market delighted in this strong showing all round the
wicket, and the shares rose 8p to 239p on a day when the equity market
was in the doldrums.
Macfarlane came to the stock market in 1973, and #1000 invested in its
shares then would now be worth #46,000, a return that it would be
difficult to emulate.
The figures beat most market expectations, which is not an unusual
occurrence for the company. The group has #20m within its sights this
year or next, but once analysts digest the 1994 figures, they are likely
to pencil in around #18.5m for the current year.
Lord Macfarlane said: ''1994 was a good year for Macfarlane Group. Our
experienced and competent management team performed admirably in
pursuing our corporate strategy.
''Although trading conditions improved last year, much of the progress
made was due to strict financial disciplines practised throughout the
group and many years of planning and strategic investment in our major
areas of activity.''
The group has faced huge increases of between 30% and 40% in raw
material prices, especially in the second half of the year. Tight
controls and improved standards of efficiency have allowed Macfarlane to
absorb some of these increases in costs. But some have had to be passed
on to customers. Every effort is being made to preserve margins.
Last year sales increased by 20.9% to just under #117m. Earnings per
share gained 22.5% to 13.78p. A planned final dividend of 3p will raise
the total from 3.84p to 4.7p for a yield of around 2.5%. Dividends have
increased by 75% in the last five years.
''Our policy on dividends is to ensure that shareholders should
benefit from a growth in income which reflects the underlying growth in
the earnings of the group,'' Lord Macfarlane said.
The group boasts a strong balance sheet with no borrowings and bank
balances in excess of #16m.
Lord Macfarlane believes that ''the generation of cash as well as
profits is fundamental to the success of any business and as part of
that discipline we have carefully chosen to invest only in those areas
which could achieve satisfactory returns''.
Packaging is the group's core business. Its success is an indicator of
the health of industry generally. Acquisitions have included Centurion
Packaging which manufactures at three locations and Peterborough-based
Dalewood Packaging Products.
The plastics mouldings division has added Wicklow Packaging, a
plastics injection moulding company near Dublin, to its portfolio of
interests.
Lord Macfarlane said that the group had coped very successfully with a
lengthy recession and with the inflationary pressures which followed.
''1995 has started well with sales and profits well ahead of the same
period last year. Group morale is excellent, and we have substantial
cash resources with which to take advantage of suitable investment
opportunities.''

BURN Stewart yesterday reported tough trading conditions, as it
announced marginally lower half-way profits.
Hit by intense pricing pressure, the Barrhead-based distiller and
bottler reported pre-tax profits of #1.49m.
At half-time last year, Burn Stewart reported earnings before tax of
#1.81m. However, stripping out an exceptional gain of #298m on the sale
last year of an investment, underlying earnings were down only 2% in the
six months to January 1.
However, first-half turnover was up 21% at #23.7m, boosted by sales of
aged whiskies.
Meanwhile, Burn Stewart's first-half cased sales were 15% higher in
volume terms, with sales of Scottish Leader up 26%.
Burn Stewart held its interim dividend unchanged at 1.7p, matching
earnings per share.
Its shares closed down 1p at 107p, well below their 1991 flotation
price of 140p.
In the year to July 3 last year, Burn Stewart reported a halving of
pre-tax profits to #4.2m, in spite of a 7% rise in turnover to slightly
more than #40m.
With the company expecting at best only modest price increases in the
second-half, chairman Bill Thornton said the company would be relatively
happy to repeat the prior year's performance.
He said: ''It is tough and that really is the message we want to get
across.''
However, Mr Thornton believes Burn Stewart is doing what it set out to
do, in terms of the underlying business, back in 1991.
He said: ''We are obviously not pleased that we can't improve the
profitability. We would like to see better prices and better margins to
reflect what we see as the real development of the business.''
Total industry sales were virtually flat during 1994, although the
''value for money'' sector gained share.
However, this area is attracting smaller incomers, who are
undercutting prices to gain a foothold.
Buying in additional mature stock to take advantage of specific
opportunities, Burn Stewart boosted total stocks from #53.7m to #56.9m
during the period.
An increase in gearing from 74% to 97% does not worry the board.
Twenty-five-year-old Scottish Leader is proving popular in Taiwan and
Burn Stewart will open a branch office there next month.

KATHERINE BUTLER
in Brussels
HOPES of a return to normality in Scotland's live export trade with
the Continent were dashed yesterday after the failure of EU Agriculture
Ministers to break a 20-month deadlock on welfare measures demanded by
animal rights campaigners.
The negotiations were adjourned for two months, indicating the extent
of division among EU governments on the key issue of maximum journey
times.
Failure to reach agreement leaves ferry companies with little option
but to retain their ban on live shipments in view of continuing public
disquiet.
EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler admitted: ''We are in a
total logjam. There is little sign of a way out.''
A French plan involving different journey times and rest intervals
depending on the type and age of animal, debated at length in February,
remains on the table but is still being rejected by some countries,
including Britain, because it does not go far enough. The Mediterranean
states, dependent on importing animals over long distances, say the
rules are too tough and would drive their meat factories out of
business.
EU officials expect the May discussions to focus on a new proposal
which would stipulate a maximum journey time of eight hours if ordinary
vehicles were used. Where special air-conditioned Pullman-style trucks
were involved, the journey time could be longer as feeding and watering
is possible on board.
British officials indicated this compromise might be acceptable to the
UK but the Germans and Austrians signalled no climb-down from their hard
line position.
Ireland, meanwhile, also badly hit by the ferry ban, announced it was
going it alone with the introduction of the French plan and would send
veterinary inspectors to the Continent to carry out spot checks on
hauliers licensed in Ireland.
Irish Agriculture Minister Ivan Yates, said the measures, including a
mandatory 12-hour rest period for animals arriving off ferries at
continental ports, should remove the justification for a ferry ban and
for any further protests.
* STEWART Whiteford, livestock convener and vice-president of the
National Farmers' Union of Scotland, met senior officials of the
European Commission in Brussels yesterday to call for measures to
protect the beef market in the UK against any disruption caused by the
reduction in calf exports.
After the meeting, Mr Whiteford said: ''We have told the Commission
about our concern that stable markets should be maintained in the UK.
European Union action must be taken if the market shows any signs of
weakening.''
The union also argued that the reference herd in Scotland for Beef
Special Premium was too low. ''We want the commission to take steps to
ensure that our producers are not further disadvantaged,'' said Mr
Whiteford.

LORD Sterling's P&amp;O shipping, cruises and construction group did not
stint in its spending on its shipping business in past years even during
difficult periods and the fruits of this policy are becoming apparent.
Yesterday the company steered majestically in with 1994 profits ahead
41% from #242.2m to #341.4m at the operating level ahead of asset sale
contributions on turnover up 5% at #5,989.6m.
This is in the upper half of market expectations which had ranged from
#320m to #355m but a feature of the results is also P&amp;O's generally
upbeat view of future progress although P&amp;O European Ferries faces the
full challenge of the Channel Tunnel in the summer and earnings are
forecast to fall in this division.
The market quickly latched on to this and also a warning about the
possible impact of a strong dollar on American returns, slicing 9p off
the share price to 582p.
At the pre-tax level profits are shown to be down from #520.6m to
#349.5m but this included #278.4m on sale of businesses and fixed assets
in 1993 against just #8.1m last year.
A final dividend of 17p gives a maintained total of 30.5p on headline
earnings per share up from 27.6p to 37.6p.
Although now largely up and running, complete services will be offered
on the Channel Tunnel this summer and P&amp;O chairman Lord Sterling does
say this will lead to some reduction in the earnings from the ferries
division.
A full-scale price war, though, seems unlikely and the ferry
companies, not least P&amp;O, have been preparing themselves for this event
for some time. P&amp;O has concentrated on improving quality and service and
a new breed of super ferries and while the tunnel is bound to get a good
deal of volume, P&amp;O will be relying on service and a growing market to
compete.
The capacity of the Channel Tunnel has so far been limited. And P&amp;O
Ferries lifted operating profits from #76.5m to #113.9m last year. So
far this year P&amp;O has seen no reduction in its cross-channel freight
business but there are imponderables ahead.
The cruise division boosted its contribution from #85.6m to #100.1m
and new ships are to be added to the fleet in the US where Princes
Cruises enjoys the largest market share of any North American-based
operator in European, trans-Panama Canal and long-distance cruises.
At home, the cruise operation will be strengthened next month when the
69,000-tonne Oriana enters into service. It will be the first cruise
ship to be specifically designed for the British market and one of the
most widely promoted ship launches of the past 30 years, albeit of
neccessity built in Germany. Its arrival at Southampton has, however,
been postponed for a week as the testing of electronic equipment had not
been completed. So celebrations have had to be deferred.
The ship was built for #200m, and its first cruise around the
Mediterranean was fully booked nine months ago with some 1600 passengers
worldwide paying from #1499 to #5320 per person for tickets.
The group's containers operation also did well despite ''challenging''
market conditions with profits ahead from #42m to #63.2m. The chairman
said that as the world economy came out of recession there was a general
increase in the level of cargo shipments and a marked increase in P&amp;O
Containers' volumes. While competitive pressures meant reduced gross
revenues on a unit basis, improved efficiency boosted operating profit.
In Bovis Construction, whose main markets are the US, the Pacific Rim
and the UK, it was increased penetration and greater efficiency which
enabled a rise from #10.2m to #11m in operating profits. The
construction market remained depressed and the total amount of work
under management fell by 10% as the average value of new products was
reduced and margins remained under pressure.
Bovis Homes benefited from a small increase in volumes and margins but
there was no real upturn in the market. However, the current year has
got off to a better start in the UK with volumes well up and a good
reception for new designs.
Overall growth in world trade exceeded 8% last year and a similar rise
is forecast for 1995. Lord Sterling said the continuing recovery from
recession of the major economies has been an important factor in this.
In the UK, P&amp;O benefited from export-led growth and the overall
strength of the economy. Some sectors such as housing and construction
have yet to show a real upswing, but businesses are trading well and
there is a sound basis for future growth.
But the chairman warned that any prolonged weakness of the US dollar
will inevitably have some impact on the returns from the American
companies. Overall, the prospects are regarded as encouraging for 1995,
particularly on the cruise side.
For the company as a whole, 1995 has started well and P&amp;O intends to
continue to maintain its investment in its operations.

Tokyo, Tuesday -- Two of Japan's elite financial institutions,
Mitsubishi Bank and Bank of Tokyo, said today they had reached a basic
agreement to merge into the world's biggest bank.
The merger would create a formidable financial player and step up
pressure on rivals in danger of being left behind, industry analysts
said after initial reports -- denied by bank spokesmen -- jolted
Japanese financial markets.
''In the last several years, financial markets in the world and Japan
have been changing rapidly. Coping with this was a major reason for
seeking the merger,'' Bank of Tokyo president Tasuku Takagaki said.
Mitsubishi is Japan's third largest commercial bank in terms of
deposits and Bank of Tokyo is the tenth largest.
A marriage between the two banks -- rumoured for years -- would create
the world's biggest bank with assets of more than 72 trillion yen.

ICELAND used to be known for its frozen food and cheap prices but in
the past year it has been perceived in the market as being not as
competitive as in the past.
Chairman and chief executive Malcolm Walker admitted that the company
may have taken its ''eye off the ball'' in its enthusisam for developing
its chilled and fresh product range.
The average spend per customer in Iceland fell slightly last year but
the company said this was largely due to the inclusion of the 38
''Iceland at Littlewoods'' stores.
These tend to be located in City centres and do not attract people
doing large weekly shops. During the year an additional unit opened at
Dumfries but six of the original 43 stores were closed.
However, the group's profits advanced to a record #70.2m pre-tax, up
8%. Total food sales were 10% higher, but excluding new store openings,
like-for-like food volume sales rose 2%. The dividend increased by 10.5%
to 4.2p after a final payment of 2.88p.
Price deflation is expected to continue this year given the
promotion-led sales drive which Iceland has initiated. This will include
features such as money-off vouchers for use in the store. Iceland likes
to compare itself to Marks &amp; Spencer. There are some similarities --
they both specialise in own-label products, operate from High Street
stores and are second destination shops for people buying food after
their main trip to one of the ''Big Three'' superstore operators.
However, there are a number of important differences, for example, in
margins.
Iceland is making an attempt to boost its margins by getting its
customers to trade up and buy its value-added ready meals which attract
higher margins. In addition it is changing its store layout in order to
get increased profits per square foot.
There are those who think that Iceland is being squeezed in the middle
of the major supermarket chains on the one hand and the limited range
discounters on the other. However Mr Walker remains convinced that
Iceland has a profitable future as a specialist food retailer ''with a
very solid and secure niche''. Indeed underlying sales growth in the
first few months of the current financial year are up about 3.5%.
The City was prepared to give Mr Walker the benefit of the doubt and
marked the shares up 5p to 169p where they yield 3.1%.

EXPANDING bus and coach operator Badgerline made record pre-tax
profits of #16.7m in its first full year since floating on the stock
market, the company reported yesterday.
It almost doubled its size during 1994 after becoming a public company
in November 1993. The major acquisitions were PMT Group and Rider Group.
Shareholders are being rewarded with a final dividend of 3p per share,
taking the total for the year to 4.5p.

SCOTTISH Metropolitan Property has shown the way forward for the
Scottish development corporations to dispose of properties that could be
difficult to sell, writes ANDREW WILSON.
It has agreed with the Livingston Development Corporation to buy
310,000 square feet of industrial property on four estates at Deans on
the M8 intersection for #9.4m including #4.5m in cash.
In return, ScotMet is selling Sidlaw House, a 59,200 sq ft office
block for #4.9m. That is already leased to the to the body and will be
on a yield of 9% and a more saleable asset while the property company
reduces its exposure to the office sector in line with oits stated
policy.
ScotMet has firmly continued on the recovery tack with half time
pre-tax profits jumping from #2.11m to #4.16m excluding gains on the
sale of investment properties. This has allowed a 50% increase in the
interim dividend to 1p and will result in a full year total 0.5p higher
at 2.5p. There is minimal tax payable this year due to tax losses built
up after the heavy losses at the turn of the decade although future
dividends wil be cobered 1[1/2] times by earnings as from 1996-97.
Reorganisation of finances with the #30m 9.9% debenture with the Bank
of Scotland and other facilities has resulted in its ability to sell
assets at a higher running yield than those of properties it is
acquiring in the expectation that there will be reversionary potential
in the medium term. industrial property seems to offer most potential
with retail not that exciting and office dull.
The policy remains to sweat assets in Scotland and at the same time
move the 30% English content ever more northwards. However, growth in
earnings will be slow even if progress is made in reducing the voids
which currently account for 5% of the #21m estimated rental value.
But there is some attraction in that the shares, 4[1/2]p better at
72p, are standing at a 29% discount on net asset value which is one of
the highest in the sector and deserves to narrow substantially given
that the company can now be counted as one of the more dependable
performers on a 4.3% yield.

Michael Tumelty talks to American composer and entrepreneur GP
Cribari, who brings the first opera to the Old Fruitmarket next week
IT'S a long way from LA to the Old Fruitmarket in the Candleriggs.
It's an even longer way from being a post-graduate in psychology and
neuro-science to being the composer of the first opera to be staged in
the Glasgow venue.
And what's more, somebody should have told American musician GP
Cribari that the arts are still in a recession in this country, and that
money is hard to come by.
Because not only has Cribari composed the opera Las Escondidas, which
opens at the Fruitmarket for a four-night run next Wednesday, he
single-handedly raised the #32,000 required to get the project off the
ground. And there's more.
The 35-year-old composer also runs the company that is promoting the
venture, OPERAting Theatre, and has recruited his own librettist,
designer, and director. And, once that was in place, he brought in an
administrator. See panache? See entrepreneurial skill?
GP -- the name's George Paul, same as his dad, and to distinguish
between them his mom called him GP instead of Junior -- was seduced away
from his doctoral thesis in Los Angeles by jazz. He took sax lessons:
''In my own time and from the local bebop guy; John Coltrane was a big
influence.'' He got into classical music the wrong way round (starting
with the moderns and working backwards) and ended up at California State
University.
He moved to London to study composition at the Guildhall School of
Music and ran into Scots-born composer Judith Weir, at that time the
resident composer at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Weir
told him of the brand-new post-graduate composition course at the RSAMD
and, in 1990, GP moved north to become one of the first batch of
students on that course.
Due to be resident for a year, he received a scholarship to do a
second year. And he's still here. ''It was a huge struggle to get a
visa, but eventually I got a clearance to stay as an artist and
writer.''
The new opera -- Cribari's second -- was conceived about four years
ago. What's more, it's venue-specific; it was conceived for the Old
Fruitmarket, with which the composer had become fascinated while
attending jazz festival gigs staged there. ''It's brilliant; a
cul-de-sac with pavements, perfect to incorporate a mock-up of a South
American village.''
At an early stage he called in designer Angela Davies (who has worked
for TAG and the Tron Theatre Company) and librettist Michael Gonzalez (a
senior lecturer in Hispanic studies) both of whom Cribari knew or had
already worked with. The director, Kate Brown, was recruited by the
composer after he had seen her production of the early opera La
Baltasara at the Tramway.
Funding started early, too. First he applied to the Scottish Arts
Council for a bursary to study and research into the opera in South
America. And off he went to Chile for four months.
Sourcing the funds for the project itself he described as
''hair-raising''. He wrote off a series of letters. The arts council
promptly came up with #5000 -- ''a small contribution but the maximum
from the fund it has for this''. The Department of Performing Arts of
Glasgow District Council then produced #13,000 on request. And the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts coughed up #14,000 on application.
How did he do it? ''It baffles me,'' said GP. ''I can't imagine anyone
knew my name -- they must have just liked the idea of the project. You
learn fast; I've learned a lot, and none of it is about music.''
Additionally, since bringing in administrator Anne Cumberland, in-kind
assistance has been obtained: students in the department of Clothing and
Fashion Technology at Cardonald College have been supplied with designs
and fabrics and are making the 40 costumes required for the production
at no cost.
Las Escondidas -- Hide and Seek -- will feature a cast of five
soloists, a chorus of 10 adults and a children's chorus of 14 (mostly
pupils at the High School of Glasgow). The band is the top-drawer
Chamber Group of Scotland, which will be conducted by Paul MacAlindin.
The plot, a fascinating tale, is drawn from a myth about an idyllic
village in South America untouched by time. There is no death, no
disease. Then a gipsy appears, introducing marvellous seductions from
the modern world. Disruption and chaos follow as tensions build between
those who want to let go of the past and those who want to preserve it.
It's not all heavy, insists the composer. Indeed it promises to be
highly colourful, with authentic choreography from Guadelupe Echegoyal
Monroy, and featuring bright Mexican garb (even the band will be
costumed) and a range of theatrical devices, not least a gigantic puppet
two-and-a-half metres tall and rejoicing in the name of the Bone Woman.
Skull biscuits will be provided for audience consumption. Gulp.
The final touch in GP Cribari's virtuoso funding coup was added
obliquely by the Old Fruitmarket itself, which installed toilets only
three weeks ago. ''We would have had to hire Portaloos, so now our
toilet budget can go elsewhere,'' said the engaging American.
Las Escondidas: Old Fruitmarket, Candleriggs, Glasgow. Wed 5 to Sat 8
at 8pm.

Nowhere else in Europe did the still life artistic genre attain such
morbid heights as in Spain, as Lesley Stevenson reports
THERE can be few cheap treats available at the moment more delicious
-- a feast for the ears and gastronomic overload for the eyes -- than
the exhibition, Spanish Still Life: From Valazquez to Goya.
The National Gallery in London remains open on Wednesday evenings
until 8pm, with live Spanish music accompanying visitors.
The still life, as an independent genre, developed across Europe in
the seventeenth century, perhaps most notably in the Protestant
Netherlands, where a gap in the market meant that artists, who might
otherwise have painted religious pictures for the Catholic church,
developed an accessible world for new, middle-class clients.
This exhibition reveals that there was a similar market in Catholic
Spain, where remnants of a religious sensibility crept into the
so-called vanitas paintings.
These profoundly-sensual works, often celebrations of the five senses,
are tinged with reminders of mortality -- perhaps carefully-placed
skulls or overblown flowers.
It seems fitting, therefore, that the six rooms of this exhibition
cluster around one devoted to the vanitas, through which the visitor has
to pass several times.
It is painted a rich and bloody red, while the others are a cool grey,
a foil for the richness of their subjects.
The earliest works are by Sanchez Cotan and are perhaps the most
perfect. Still Life with Quince, Cabbage, Melon, and Cucumber shows a
larder with quince and cabbage eerily suspended from strings to preserve
their freshness.
Although it is not a vanitas piece, Cotan, who was a lay brother in a
Carthusian monastery, invokes a near-religious experience. The
precar-iousness of these unblemished objects is a potent reminder that
nothing is forever.
Edinburgh's An Old Woman Cooking Eggs, by Velazquez, has been reunited
with London's Kitchen Scene with Christ in the House of Martha and Mary
and The Waterseller of Seville, from Apsley House. None of them is,
strictly speaking, a still life, since figures predominate, but the
interest in humble objects has never been bettered.
There are several paintings of dead game by Goya, all produced during
the horrors of the Peninsular War. The moonlit Still Life with Golden
Bream, and similarly nocturnal Still Life with Woodcocks, are as
effective as his most grisly anti-war messages.

MORE first-night boos, this time for Siegfried, the third instalment
of Richard Jones's new Ring cycle at Covent Garden. As with Rheingold
and Walkure last autumn, the anger of the Wagnerian train-spotters was
unjustified, though hardly surprising. Jones's irreverent touches are
just what an otherwise bad story needs -- but tell that to the purists.
Siegfried is the great hero of the Ring -- pure, good, and boring.
Siegfried Jerusalem plays his namesake as a distinctly unheroic gawky
teenager. His voice showed occasional signs of strain in the face of the
unbelievable, enormous sounds produced by conductor Bernard Haitink and
the ROH orchestra.
Anne Evans, who has taken over from Deborah Polaski as Brunhilde, is
equally solid. Gone are the gymslip and skeleton top in favour of a
rather staid frock. The voice is well rounded, if occasionally in need
of more volume, but both she and Jerusalem fail to raise the final idyll
above the mundane. This was not invincible love destined to destroy the
gods.
The evening belongs instead to the outstanding Graham Clark as the
poisonous dwarf Mime, who raises the boy Siegfried then tries to use him
to gain control of the ring. The blue dress and lanky grey hair lend him
an ambiguous sexuality. Clark is short and intense and brings a raging,
demonic enthusiasm to the role. John Tomlinson returns with his moving,
beautifully sung Wotan.
The curved surfaces, visual jokes, and Pat Collins's magical lighting
are stronger than ever. The final destruction of the gods in
Gotterdammerung next autumn should be quite something.

MR Jaconelli, who owns the chippy in Maryhill Road, was concerned
about where all the cars would go.
Equally worried was a navy uniformed security guard minding a site hut
adjacent to the church. A projectile had just missed him and he was
warning car owners about potential vandalism. The reason for the big
influx of recent registered vehicles was not a midweek fixture for the
Jags, but a recital in aid of funds for the Charles Rennie Mackintosh
Society and the star attraction was the 16-year-old violinist Melissa
Forshaw.
Given the bare number of well-kent faces from the ranks of the RSNO
dotted around the pews, this could have been a daunting audience for
even an experienced professional, but Miss Forshaw stuck to her music
and refused to be fazed. If the opening Handel Sonata proved a trifle
measured, the following excerpts from the Bruch Concerto were very
impressive.
Equally convincing was a movement from the Grieg Sonata, full of
technical accomplishment and delivered completely without mannerisms.
Post-interval the allegro from the Brahms Sonatensatz was full of
attack but perhaps marginally less secure than the Bruch performance.
No doubts, though, about technical command in the fiendishly taxing
piece by Alvo Part matched by a sparkling display of control in the
Scherzo-Tarantella from Wieniawski. Throughout the evening Alison
McGregor was sensitively supportive at the piano with both performers
apparently undisturbed by traffic noise, banging doors, and a flashing
rogue light. A prodigious talent this, to be gently nurtured.

IF there was a touch of panache in the Scottish Chamber Orchestra's
twenty-first birthday gala concert last night, then we had to wait until
the end for it when, to the accompaniment of Handel's Fireworks Music,
the indoor fireworks display -- dazzlingly effective and put together
with a touch of choreographic genius -- finally set the place alight.
Funny things, parties. Very often the least-effective elements are the
formal proceedings.
James MacMillan's new brass quintet, Adam's Rib, while written for the
occasion, could hardly have launched the gala on a lower note
(literally).
That's not a comment on the piece, where MacMillan demonstrated, as
ever, that he can create something absolutely arresting out of minimal
materials. It needs to be heard in a different context.
Chief conductor Ivor Bolton took over for a performance of Bach's
First Brandenburg Concerto which lacked any bracing edge, and was
unusually sedate and stodgy.
And Peter Maxwell Davies's Orkney Wedding, which has been around a
while, lilted where it should have stumbled, and was staid where it
should have been steamin'.
Things improved in the second half when Sir Charles Mackerras directed
Marie McLaughlin (replacing James Galway) in shining performances of
three Mozart arias, before an authoritative account of the Fireworks
Music -- where the SCO at least and at last so unded more like
themselves: with a bit of bite.
* Concert sponsored by the Royal Bank of Scotland.

''THOU hast spoken no word all this while,'' remarks the schoolmaster
to the constable after a typically intense verbal interchange in
Shakespeare's early romantic comedy. ''Nor understood none neither,
sir,'' comes the swift reply -- followed by one of the biggest laughs of
the evening.
Herein lies the great problem for this lyrical-period play, and indeed
the explanation for its neglect for the best part of 200 years after
Shakespeare's death.
For Love's Labour's Lost is at once a celebration of and a satire on
linguistic excess. On the one hand it's all flowery verses, rhyming
couplets and dazzling repartee; on the other it's a send-up of the
superficial values that would place intellect for its own sake above the
true passions of the heart.
In this respect Ian Judge's production for the Royal Shakespeare
Company makes a good deal of sense by updating the piece to a pre-First
World War university setting. Our image of Brideshead-era Oxbridge is
very much one of foppish young men living in a climate of cold-hearted
reasoning and emotional aridity.
But despite this, I can't help feeling that the production itself
inhabits an emotional vacuum, that until the touching penultimate scene,
it lacks any real sense of romance.
Perhaps as much as anything, it is that it is without charismatic
performances -- star-name Jenny Agutter is no better or worse than any
of the ensemble -- and without that there is little sense of purpose,
passion, or vitriol to give room to any ironic commentary beyond the
most obvious knockabout gags. The audience was warm and appreciative,
but for me it was all riddles and no romance.

Robert Dickson recalls a murder mystery with a difference where
brilliant forensic work led to the killer through a highly unusual route
WHEN a body is discovered in suspicious circumstances, the police and
procurator-fiscal usually look to a pathologist for assistance in trying
to ascertain the cause of death. They also often rely heavily on the
forensic medicine expert to provide them with clues as to the
perpetrator if there has been an unlawful killing. The identity of the
body is usually the least of the authorities' worries; how and when did
the victim die and has the killer left any clues are the normal
questions.
When two bodies were found in June, 1913 the situation was different.
Once their true identities had been found then it was obvious who was
responsible but to this day how they were killed has never been solved.
The exact date or time of their deaths or the cause of their demise; the
usual questions in any murder trial remained unanswered. Instead the
brilliant work of the forensic medicine department at Edinburgh
University in deducing the age, sex, and size of the two boys -- and
even what they had last had to eat -- allowed the police to effect an
arrest within 36 hours. The scientific detective work was to culminate
in Edinburgh's first execution for more than 15 years.
Readers of the Glasgow Herald of Tuesday, June 10, were largely
unaware of the drama which lay behind the small article headed ''Quarry
mystery -- two boys drowned'' recording the find by two labourers of the
remains of two young boys in a water-logged quarry near Winchburgh. The
reporter was also able to record the arrest of Joseph Higgins, a
40-year-old widower ''who was known to have two boys'' who ''had not
been seen for some time''.
The efforts of a young medical student who was later to become regius
professor of forensic medicine at Edinburgh had given the police all the
information they required. Sydney Smith was an assistant in the forensic
medicine department when he was called, together with his professor, by
the procurator-fiscal at Linlithgow. They were asked to examine what had
been found. A local doctor had advised the authorities that post-mortems
would be pointless as the bodies were so decayed that in his view
nothing could be discovered. At best, it appeared that two young people
of unknown sex had died many months before and the only clue that there
had been foul play lay in the fact that the bodies appeared to have been
tied together.
The authorities had no information on any missing children and more in
hope than in any expectation of success it was agreed to invite
Professor Harvey Littlejohn and his assistant to prepare a report.
Because the remains had been submerged for many months their task was
particularly unpleasant although it did have one amusing sequel.
The careful removing of the clothing revealed the first clue -- a
laundry mark from the poorhouse at Dysart. This was on the jacket of the
larger body but as there was still no idea as to when the tragedy had
occurred the information was merely a starting point. A subsequent
post-mortem however answered a large number of queries.
It was quickly established that (contrary to first impressions) the
bodies were those of two boys and not as had been originally thought --
that of a boy and girl. Detailed considerations of their teeth showed
one to be aged about six, the other between three and four. Their
heights were easily ascertained by measurement and it was even possible
to state that they had each had a meal with vegetables and barley about
one hour before death. In each case they had had short brown hair which
had been recently cut.
For the authorities however the most valuable finding was that both
boys had been in the quarry for between 18 months and two years and that
they had not been carried or transported there. A search was therefore
started to find any trace of two boys aged about six and four who were
of specific heights, both with short brown hair, who had eaten a meal
locally and who had apparently walked the one mile from the main road to
their deaths. It was also known that one had clothing which had come
from the Dysart poorhouse.
It did not take the police long to hear that Joseph Higgins, who
worked locally, had had two sons of the correct size, age, and hair
colouring. These children had not been seen for nearly two years
although Higgins had claimed that they had gone to Canada. When it was
learned that the boys had come from Dysart before their widower father
had brought them to West Lothian, and that the lady with whom they had
been staying remembered giving them Scotch broth just before their
father had taken them away, there was ample evidence to justify an
arrest.
Nobody ever ascertained how the two boys were killed and, beyond
admitting to a priest before his execution that he was responsible for
the deaths, the killer said nothing. His trial before Lord Johnston and
a jury at Edinburgh High Court concentrated largely on his sanity. After
the jury rejected his counsel's argument that he was unfit to plead, the
result was a foregone conclusion. At 6.50pm on September 11, 1913,
Joseph Higgins was condemned to death; three weeks later he became the
first person to be hanged in Calton jail since the turn of the century.
As well as showing how the forensic evidence gave the police the
essential breakthrough by revealing sufficient clues to enable the
victims to be identified, the newspaper reports at the time showed some
very important differences with nowadays. In 1913 there was no right of
appeal in serious cases and accordingly the jury's verdict could not be
challenged. It was only in 1926, after agitation over the Oscar Slater
case, that a change in the law created the Court of Criminal Appeal.
Another difference is shown by the reports of the trial which are
graphic in their details. The description of Higgins's execution on a
scaffold erected by the city architect seems to modern eyes both lurid
and sensational.
It is however the pre-trial reports which show how far the courts have
moved in the last 80 years to try to ensure fairness for an accused
person. Joseph Higgins's defence did not seek to challenge the identity
of the victims nor that they had been murdered. How fair his trial could
have been had these matters been in dispute must be in doubt. The
newspaper reports after his arrest but before his trial reported:
''Higgins neglected his children and was imprisoned. He failed to
implement his promise to pay maintenance and took them away before
wandering about the country with them. The children have not been seen
for some time.''
Such a statement could have prejudiced any juror; no reporter nowadays
would dare to give details of somebody's criminal past prior to their
trial nor to so blatantly point the finger at an accused person.
Nowadays responsible journalism and the controls imposed by the courts
ensure that a person's prior convictions and any unfair details are kept
from any prospective juror until after the trial.
And what was the one amusing consequence? So impressed was Sydney
Smith with the state of the bodies that he retained various parts to
carry out further tests and to add to the department's museum. To return
to Edinburgh from Winchburgh he took a train with his ''samples'' in a
large brown paper parcel. The smell in the compartment became so
indescribable that fellow passengers complained to the guard but before
the true cause could be found the culprit had disappeared taking his
evidence with him.

IT must be must be mixing with the legal profession that leads even
the humble layman to commit culpable homicide of the English language. A
member of the canteen staff at the Court of Session was inquiring of
another when a colleague would be returning to work. ''Circa 11
o'clock,'' came the reply.
Of course lawyers always use big important-sounding words, preferably
in Latin if at all possible. ''Expeditious'' in the sense of fast or
quick is an abiding favourite, as in the popular legal hit Why don't you
come home, expeditious Gonzales?
There are other examples in the lawyers' hit parade: You ain't nuthin
but a canine of dubious pedigree; Baby, you can operate the steering
mechanism of my automobile; or Precipitation keeps following Newtonian
principles on my occupital region?
Just a simple case of res ipsa loquitur.
History judges
THE Scottish Law Commission has recommended that the normal rule in
criminal trials that hearsay evidence is inadmissible should be relaxed
so that, for example, a written statement made previously could be
allowed as evidence in the absence of the person who made it.
If this had been the law last century, the celebrated case of
Madeleine Smith might have had a very different outcome: instead of
living to a ripe old age after a not proven verdict she would probably
have hanged.
This was because the diary of her lover, Pierre L'Angelier, which
could have crucially established contact between the couple on the night
of his death, would have been allowed as evidence.
Her defence counsel, the future Lord President Inglis, was asked after
the trial whether he thought his client was guilty. He declined to
answer the question directly but added: ''I would rather dance with her
than dine with her.''
Plodding
pleaders
LORD GILL was making a similar point last week in his excellent speech
bemoaning the Byzantine complexities of procedure in the Court of
Session: ''Twenty-five years ago, it was still possible for an advocate
to make a good living on the procedure roll, taking pleading points to
which the court was all too willing to listen but which nowadays seem
pettifogging and pedantic. There are some pleaders today who keep the
flame of that tradition alive.''
Who on earth are these boring pleaders? I think we should be told.
Spadework
NONE of this pedantic pettyfogging for Lord Prosser, a man not
normally noted for calling a spade a garden utensil. Senior counsel
stood up in his court recently and handed him a written note of his
arguments.
Lord Prosser appeared somewhat surprised at this formality and
informed counsel: ''When I was your seniority, I would not know what I
was until I was on my feet.''
Good will
DEATH, where is thy sting? Probably in the will left by a cantankerous
old goat who has just passed on. Like the man who left #15 for his
publican to buy a Bible ''so he can learn how Christ turned water into
wine, instead of the other way round'', the factory owner who said ''to
my wife, I leave her lover in the knowledge I was not the fool she
thought I was'' or the husband who left his assests to his wife on
condition that she remarry ''so someowne regrets my death''.
Solicitors are being invited to take part in a will-making scheme this
summer which will encourage donations to the the British Heart
Foundation and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. The ICRF has had a few
oddity legacies in the past: Benjamin Britten and Wagner manuscripts,
Dame Clara Butt's brooch given by Queen Victoria, and the royalties from
Kiss Me Goodnight, Sergeant Major. The latter might soon be an
appropriate medley for the captains of the Tory Party.
Bench marks
THERE'S already been a glut of publications and awards this year for
some of the less savoury aspects of human existence. The elevation of a
public convenience at North Berwick to Loo of the Year and Mark Leech's
residents' guide to the best and worst of Britain's jails.
Pursuing the same vein, the diary is now seeking nominations for the
Scottish courthouse of the year. We may be on to a loser in strictly
architectural terms: no legal edifice made the top 50 modern buildings
favoured by Docomomo Scotland, although Monktonhall Colliery and the
east wing of the State Hospital at Carstairs did.
So the brief is wider to include general ambience (like Kirkcaldy's
welcoming aroma of linoleum, and Aberdeen's shrieking seagulls) and even
shrieval peccadiloes. The wittiest nomination will earn a bottle of a
good legal dram (like Sheep Dip or Auld Acrimony).

THERE is one good, and probably in the end convincing, reason for John
Major to remain leader of the Conservatives and lead them into the
General Election. It is the party's inability to agree on a successor.
One cure for that is always in theory available, to have a bruising
contest for the leadership which would purge the present dissensions.
The experience of 1963 and the succession of Sir Alec Douglas-Home
suggest, however, that the wounds would still fester. It was not in any
event then a formula for winning the next election.
It would be preferable to have some heir apparent, who may not, in the
nature of things, be a unanimous choice, but who can at least make his
opponents feel like good losers. That was the happy position in which
Major placed himself in 1990: elected mainly by the votes of the right,
but perfectly acceptable to the left, if because to both he was still
such an unknown quantity.
There is no comparable figure today. Let us take three candidates for
the succession, Kenneth Clarke, Michael Heseltine, and Michael Portillo.
Because the party is riven by faction, they have all been driven to
appeal to faction, more perhaps than a prudent politician should, more
certainly than Major ever did.
Thus, Clarke has built on his virtues as a tough pragmatist of the
traditional Tory sort by cultivating a commitment to Europe. Doubtless
he has always had it inside him but, not being a great thinker, he just
accepts the conventional wisdom that Britain's international standing is
going to depend in large degree on Europe. This may be right or it may
be wrong but, more to the purpose, it differentiates his product and his
profile as a potential leader. It gains him support gratis, because
pro-Europeans need to fall in behind someone who cannot, like
themselves, be pilloried as wimpish, grovelling, and unpatriotic.
It is more difficult for Heseltine to differentiate his product
because he has been so many things to so many men. But that is his
essence, not substance but style: the style of the wealthy entrepreneur,
the stirring orator, the man who had the guts to stand up to Margaret
Thatcher, the politician with the unquenchable ambition to become Prime
Minister despite the blows that fate has dealt him. What he wants if he
gets there is harder to see.
We know it has something to do with industrial development, with One
Nation and with Europe again. This may be coherent in a way that
Heseltine has yet to demonstrate. On the other hand, it may amount to a
lot of fabulous nonsense. But if style is what the party needs now --
and who can doubt it? -- then Heseltine may be right to mark himself out
by style.
Portillo has no trouble differentiating his product. It is Thatcherite
in the sense of commitment to the market. Even so, it is not quite the
same as the lost leader's. You can scan his speeches in vain for any
soupcon of her knee-jerking nationalism. Perhaps that comes from his
being half a Spaniard. More likely, it comes from his membership of a
generation to which the Second World War and the Empire mean little,
which accepts the fact of relative national decline as something to be
dealt with, rather than kicked against.
When he argues against Europe, he does it from an intellectual
analysis: Brussels is set on a disastrous course of centralisation and
dirigisme bound to make our continent less democratic and less
prosperous than it might be. Yet argue against Europe he does, and so
picks up gratis the anti-dago vote.
Faction creates these differentiations by men who may be more sensible
than a good many of their followers. Each then acquires a vested
interest in the continuation of faction, which has indeed waxed fiercer
than in any other Conservative Government since the time of Suez. But at
least two of them must realise that reliance on faction renders any
immediate bid for the leadership impossible. They must await the great
solvent of all problems, what Harold Macmillan famously defined as
''Events, dear boy! Events!''
If one of them did try to hasten events, by assassinating Major for
example, the most likely result would be full-scale war inside the
party. The Government, so far from being saved, would drown in the
welter of its own blood-letting.
The only one of the three who may not realise this, perhaps because he
fits least easily with any faction, is Heseltine. He therefore becomes
the man to watch. And we do hear rumours of plots being hatched, for
strokes so bold as to confound events. There is talk of a dream ticket,
of Heseltine and Portillo combining to bring the first to No10 and
assure the second of a smooth succession in due course. In economic
terms, this might make Hitler and Stalin look consistent, but it also
leaves out of account Clarke and his followers, who would feel aggrieved
to say the least.
Moreover the right, no lovers of Heseltine, would be hoping to hand
him a poisoned chalice: his health may give way, he may lose the
election in any event. This is no formula for subduing faction.
To do that, the party needs things to unite on. But it already has
plenty. Economic policy is successful, and nobody else, even Labour, is
going to do anything very different. Over the rest of domestic policy,
the Tories are now guided primarily by what public opinion will accept.
All their tensions come to a head on Europe, and what is needed there
is a pragmatism which brings results: again, pretty much what Major
offers, or tries to. At any rate, no potential successor has been able
to put himself in a position where he would be more capable than Major
of uniting the party on Europe. That is why Major will stay.

SO, Helena Christiansen has finally come to her supermodel senses and
ditched fiance Michael Hutchence who, in recent weeks, has been
co-starring with Paula Yates in a British tabloid sex saga.
Christiansen ended weeks of ''will she, won't she?'' speculation and
finally dished out the red card to the INXS lead singer, a
self-confessed womaniser who must now realise that he can't have
Christiansen cake and eat Paula's too. There was a point when it looked
suspiciously as if Christiansen was going to adopt the forgive-and
forget policy favoured by doe-eyed Naomi Campbell, who for a while
turned a blind eye to her then-fiance Adam Clayton's frolics with London
prostitutes.
Perhaps Christiansen woke up one morning, looked in the mirror and
realised that she didn't have to put up with that kind of public
humiliation.
Meanwhile The Ballad of Bob and Paula is looking suspiciously like a
long-playing number, a veritable tears'n' trauma country and western
saga. There's Bob, all bereft, a weepy onlooker to the media spectacle
which is his separated spouse's dalliance with the Australian musician.
This is the same Peroxide Paula who preached family values and
instructed young mums to stay at home and mind their children, a
sentiment which she interpreted liberally herself, with a full-time
nanny to aid and abet her in-the-limelight career.
The hypocrisy of the blonde bitch has always set my teeth on edge but
I have to confess to a sneeking admiration for her actions of late. When
Paula became entangled with the hunky Hutch she simply upped sticks and
left Sir Bob. No messing. But Hutchence is no Sir Galahad.
A model of male prevarication, he was reluctant to give up on his
relationship with the Danish superbabe, despite an obvious entanglement
with Yates and another tabloid scoop which placed him at the scene of a
young London yuppie's bedside.
Typical. Most men make a real hash of splitting up, favouring the
long, drawn-out, painful amputation over the clean break. They tend to
take Paul Simon's advice on Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover too
literally, tentatively trying out each method one by one before taking
the final plunge.
Men are always plagued by guilt over a relationship break up. This
does not mean they are caring chaps, it is because their egos insist
that the woman in their life will have no life if they depart.
So, they come up with a plan to evade the responsibility of breaking
up; the Behaving Badly Blueprint. Treat her so dreadfully that she'll
walk away from the resultant mess herself. Stay out suspiciously late
and feign hurt innocence when challenged. Be moody. Make vague,
insincere protestations of devotion while acting like a stranger.
You'll drive her half mad with hurt and confusion but you will drive
her away. The Behaving Badly Blueprint is practically foolproof -- only
diehard doormats, like Alan Clarke's wife Jane, will withstand it. And
at the final confrontation when the distraught partner suggests a
separation men sit down, stare at their socks and shake their heads
sadly: ''Oh well, if you think it's for the best. I guess I just can't
commit to this relationship.'' Which is code for ''monogamy sucks''.
It's pathetic and cowardly. A woman would never practise such
mealy-mouthed hypocrisy. When a woman instigates a split-up she socks it
to him straight. Forget the male platitude ''It's not you, it's me.''
Women prefer ''It's not me, its you.''
The play Dumbstruck, currently wowing the country once again, contains
a superb scene where Johnny Ramone, played by Jimmy Chisholm, is being
ditched by girlfriend Maureen Carr. ''Yir chucked!'' she bawls apropos
of nothing in particular. ''That's a dissy with a double-d.''
Bewildered, he demands an explanation. ''See, all that time we were
going out and you thought we were getting on great. Well, yi were
wrang.'' 'Nuff said.
Of course, I'm practising the columnist's disingenuous art of
selective examples; women do have a woeful habit of desperately trying
to breathe fire into a burnt-out relationship rather than confidently
stamping on the cinders and, like the best of them, I've chewed the
carpet so hard I still have the fibres in my fillings, and men do often
end flings, relationships, and marriages with callous abruptness -- like
Daniel Day Lewis throwing out the baby with the bathwater when he faxed
pregnant lover Isabelle Adjani adieu.
And Phil Collins may spin money from schmaltzy love songs but he also
favoured this brand of technological termination, informing his wife of
his disinterest in their marriage by fax.
But we live and learn and us chicks is learning fast. The modern gal's
heroines are Thelma and Louise and Shirley Valentine and for a long time
now our anthem has been Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive, with its
get-lost-quick motif.
Men whine, ''You deserve better than me'', as they try to wriggle out
of domestic bliss and funnily enough, when we are dishing the dirt we
agree, with a defiant, ''I deserve better than you.'' Three cheers to
Christiansen.

THE United States has a deep and abiding faith in trade sanctions as a
weapon of diplomacy. It has every intention of maintaining severe
sanctions against Iraq; it has recently tightened sanctions against
Cuba; there are sanctions against Serbia; now the US wants to institute
an embargo on buying oil from Libya.
The trouble is that there is very little conclusive evidence that
trade sanctions ever work. There were sanctions against Rhodesia 30
years ago, and the Royal Navy patrolled the Indian Ocean to keep oil
from reaching Beira, Mozambique, the terminus of the Rhodesia pipeline.
In due course, the Rhodesian government handed over to the black
nationalists it had fought and imprisoned for years. But sanctions had
very little to do with it.
In the beginning, they were totally ineffective because South Africa
and the Portuguese colonies ignored them. The turning point came when
Portugal pulled out of Africa and the guerrillas were able to operate
out of Mozambique. Then South Africa pulled the plug, and Rhodesian
Premier Ian Smith capitulated. It was the guerrillas and, above all, the
demographic pressure that defeated Rhodesia, not UN sanctions.
What about South Africa, subject to a series of sanctions and
embargoes? Undoubtedly the pressure helped sway the white South
Africans. They were ostracised on every field for decade after decade,
and Western firms were forced, by public and political pressure, to cut
links. The latter were replaced by the Japanese.
The best you can say about sanctions is that they helped push
President de Klerk and his friends faster along a road that they were
destined to travel anyway. Internal political pressure by the ANC and,
once again, demographics, were the chief incentive to the extraordinary
turnaround three years ago.
Ronald Reagan's supporters claim that his tough opposition to the
''Evil Empire'' was responsible for the abrupt collapse of the Soviet
Union. Nonsense. Americans had been opposing the Soviets for 70 years,
with a brief interval from 1941 to 1946, with trade embargoes,
sanctions, and everything else. Communism collapsed under its own
weight, not because the US refused to sell it computers.
As for Cuba, that wretched island of Marxist dogmatism still resists
every pressure the United States can exert, short of invasion. Dr Castro
took power in December 1958 and the US imposed a trade embargo a year
later. Castro is now on his ninth American President and I would not bet
on Clinton's outlasting him.
Meanwhile, we are coming up to the fifth anniversary of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait and the first UN sanctions. Saddam Hussein is still
in power and, though he has allowed the UN to dismantle most of his
nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and, although he has finally
allowed his parliament to recognise Kuwait as an independent state,
no-one can pretend that sanctions, or anything else, have done much to
resolve the underlying danger.
Now comes Libya. Quite apart from the difficulty of persuading the UN
Security Council to impose an oil embargo, does anyone really expect
that tougher sanctions would persuade Colonel Gaddafi to turn over the
two Lockerbie suspects? And if he did?
The two men would be put on trial, probably in Britain, and if the
British and Americans are right, it would be proved that; they were
Libyan intelligence officers acting under orders; they put the bomb on
Pan Am 103 in December, 1988, because Gaddafi agreed to help revenge
Iran for the American shooting down of a civilian airliner six months
earlier, and because the US had bombed Tripoli, allegedly killing one of
Gaddafi's children, in 1986.
Sanctions have always been seen as an alternative to military action,
a legitimate punishment for rogue nations, whether or not they succeed
in modifying its behaviour. Serve Cuba right, for putting up with
Castro. Serve Iraq right for invading Kuwait and oppressing its
minorities. Libya deserves punishment for terrorism, and for invading
several of its neighbours.
The US bombed Tripoli to retaliate against Libya's alleged role in a
terrorist bombing in Berlin. Gaddafi is still there, nine years later.
Proposing the oil embargo indicates that the United States takes
Libya's guilt in the Pan Am bombing seriously. But the embargo would not
bring down Gaddafi any faster than bombs did, or any more than either
have brought down Castro or Saddam.

IT must be something they put in the crispy noodles in Midlothian.
From the district court, that fount of urban lore, comes the tale of a
Bathgate man convicted last week of smashing the window of a blameless
Chinese restaurant in Penicuik and making off into the night when
witnesses intervened.
A chase, as they say, ensued, in the course of which the accused lost
his shoes and, it seems, his sense of direction. With the law arriving
on the scene, our window-smasher, who admitted to being severely
over-refreshed at the time, somehow thought it wise to sprint hotfoot
for the River Esk. There, stuck between the devil and the deep blue
stream, he dived in.
The court heard that Bathgate's answer to Indiana Jones was ''trying
to hide below the water from the police'' when his pursuers spotted him.
However, as depute procurator-fiscal Brian Rovertson assured the
bench, ''the police managed to find him there without resorting to an
underwater team''.
The accused was, we understand, stir-fried but not shaken by the
experience.
Gone with the wind
ST PATRICK'S Day may not be the event in Ireland itself that it is in
New York -- something to do with the lack of Irish politicians fighting
for a quick word with Bill Clinton, perhaps -- but over the water they
do their best, weather permitting.
According to the Donegal Democrat, this year's parade at Bundoran
(''the county's premier seaside resort'') was, for example, a great
success -- if you didn't mind storm-force winds with gusts in excess of
90mph.
''At one stage in the proceedings,'' the paper reports, ''such was the
intensity of the wind, not a single person, child or adult, was capable
of going past the turn-off to the Promenade opposite the Holyrood Hotel,
towards the west end of the town. The parade therefore terminated at the
hotel's car park.''
Gone with the wind, too, was any chance of military intervention:
''Even the Army's 28th battalion pipe band decided that the going was
'too risky', clad as they were in their traditional kilt attire as they
hit the cover.''
Tunes of glory
REVIEWING a performance of the Pied Piper musical Rats by children at
Coldstream Primary School, the Berwickshire News and East Lothian Herald
reports: ''The enthusiasm put into songs such as 'We're revolting'
showed just how much the children were enjoying themselves . . .'' Mrs
Abernathy, plainly a woman of iron resolve, accompanied on the piano.
Shell shock
A STRANRAER man alleged to have stolen more than 1400 eggs from a
locked shed was released on bail at Stranraer Sheriff Court last week
after pleading not guilty. A second man alleged to have been involved
failed to appear in court and was said to have flown the coop.
Must try harder
IT is not for us to doubt the worth of Comic Relief, but as reports
continue to come in of people prepared to kill themselves just to be
kind, we feel entitled to ask if there aren't easier ways. Or wasn't
Paul McGregor, who spent seven and a half hours crawling on his hands
and knees from Duns to Greenlaw before rounding off the day with a worm
sandwich, capable of thinking up a harder way to raise #350?
Page boys
AS both readers may know, this column likes to keep abreast of
innovations from around the world. We therefore can't convey just how
excited we were to hear of a new paging service now available in
Ventura, California, land of citrus fruits and nuts.
It has nothing to do with doctors, lawyers, or the emergency services.
No, it's much more important than that. For only $21 a month,
windsurfers, those exciting people, can now be kept informed on a
round-the-clock basis of surf conditions on the Pacific.
Meanwhile, from Nashville, Tennessee, comes a rare sighting of a
politician saying what he really means. Calling for the removal of a
state constitutional requirement that prisons should be ''safe and
comfortable'', Representative Frank Buck asked: ''Why do we owe
prisoners any better standard of living than the rest of society?''
Hurry now to unsafe, uncomfortable Nashville.
Or head, instead, for civilised Baltimore, where the cops have had
their old-style twirling night sticks abolished. Police Commissioner
Thomas C Frazier said this week the old clubs were ''intimidating'' and
added, ''It sends the wrong kind of message of what the police officer
is doing and what he intends to do with the stick''.
Not all of Baltimore's finest are convinced. ''It's supposed to be
intimidating,'' said one officer. ''It's a stick''.
Jumble tale
THIS from the Shetland Times: ''The third paragraph in a story last
week about Shetland Public Operating Taxis became somewhat jumbled. It
should have read: ''The issue of ownership of licensed taxi plates was
hotly debated, taxi members arguing that such ownership by them would
substantially validate their business investment, and that such
ownership is common practice elsewhere.'' The story also had the wrong
headline on it. Our apologies.''
Glad cleared we up that got.
Oscar Charlie
WATCHING the Oscars in the middle of the night, for no reason we care
to examine, reminded us of Forrest Gump's wise apothegm, ''Film awards
are like a box of chocolates; too much will make you sick''. Still, we
were consoled by the thought that next year Britain's challenge for a
Golden Muppet could be spearheaded by none other than the Prince of
Wales.
Reports that Channel 4 has struck a deal with Disney to distribute the
heir's video The Legend of Lochnagar in the US surely means that a
Windsor is now a serious contender for nomination. Best supporting
husband, perhaps? Best costume? Best adaptation of an existing tax
arrangement? Given that, by all accounts, he plays a miniature figure in
a cartoon fantasy, we believe only accusations of type-casting stand in
Charlie's way.
And finally . . .
From far-off Zaire comes news of the charismatic preacher who recently
drew thousands of followers to a place called Kikwit, 190 miles west of
Kinshasa. The divine's attempt to walk on water came to an unscheduled
end when he drowned.

IF pressed, there is hardly a politician who will not deplore
fuel-poverty in Scotland. Some might even suggest that this or that
remedy might be found. But, until now, few have done anything about it.
Conspicuous among that enlightened and determined band are the present
SNP-controlled councils who have pushed through winter warm-up
campaigns. Among all the chattering and wrangling about whether legal or
not, they alone have had the political will to do something about it on
a large scale; hundreds of thousands of pounds, still rising, and
gathered from many coffers to be delivered at the points of need with no
loss and at little cost.
Brian Wilson is unwise to attack this life-saving organisational
initiative. The more he boos, the more determined are these councillors
to launch even better and braver campaigns for next winter.
Of course these warm-up campaigns have a political message. They point
to painful want and dangerously low temperatures endured by many Scots
in the midst of an abundance of coal and oil. And they show what can be
done when Scots themselves gain power over their own affairs
undistracted by Whitehall. From now on there will be chapter after
chapter of such victories over the old order and its champion, Brian
Wilson MP.

BRIAN Wilson is himself lacking in generosity towards those trying to
do their best for their communities (March 24). Perhaps he should put
aside the diatribe distributed from Keir Hardie House and consider the
facts.
The SNP's attack on fuel poverty in Tayside this winter was worth
#503,000 -- over 70 times greater than Labour's previous best effort.
The Warm Up for Winter campaign's three-month holiday from
meals-on-wheels and lunch-club charges had a potential average saving
for pensioners of around #20 built-in, money which could then be
diverted to help with the winter fuel bills. The benefits check
component of the scheme has also identified over #1m in previously
unclaimed monies for the vulnerable elderly during the next year.
As for Labour's record in helping the vulnerable elderly during the
winter, Brian Wilson should rightly squirm in embarrassment at the mere
#7000 his Tayside colleagues threw at this huge problem last year.
SNP councillors in Tayside came into office last May determined to
tackle this issue. I, for one, feel good about the inroads made by the
SNP administration this winter. As we attempt to improve the scheme for
next year, maybe the Labour Party should stop sniping from the sidelines
and consider playing a more constructive role. Or is that too much to
ask?

BRIAN Wilson is wrong when he says of the Scottish National Party that
''there is nothing about their record in Scottish local government which
suggests they are better than anyone else either in motivation or
competence when it comes to delivering services'' (March 24).
I hope he will not think it ungenerous of me if I point out that
Grampian Regional Council has been chosen as Britain's best-run local
authority. The judges of the Solace-PA Consulting Group Total Quality
Award, 1995, were unanimous in giving first prize to what Brian Wilson
describes as ''the Nationalist-dominated Grampian council.''
Brian Wilson declares that local government is ''about delivering the
best possible services at the most reasonable cost'', and as that is
exactly what voters in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, and Moray are getting
from their regional council, I could well understand if Brian Wilson
would generously advise North-east voters to vote SNP on April 6.

MR James Scott is rather good with figures but not with words (March
21).
He describes the rule applied to the 1979 Scottish devolution
referendum, where 40% of those eligible to vote actually required to
vote ''Yes'', as a ''modest requirement''. If the same ''modest
requirement'' were applied to General Elections, no party would ever be
elected to the Westminster Parliament as governments only enjoy around
31% of the eligible vote.
As far as arch-Unionists are concerned, a simple majority is
sufficient to elect an MP or a government which can then go on to put in
place one of the most anti-democratic swindles ever perpetrated against
the Scottish people, the 40% rule.
On a 60% turnout (regarded as fairly normal in countries which use
referenda regularly), to achieve the so-called ''modest requirement'' a
66.6% share of the vote is required. What party achieves 66% of the
vote?
Over the last 25 years, as the support for the SNP has ebbed and
flowed, the Unionists (Tory, Labour, and Liberal), have all promised,
and voted against, devolution.
Cynical manipulation, double talk, and lack of Scottish priority on
the part of the Unionists only serves to highlight Scotland's true
destiny, to be a nation once again.

THE letter from E Dunsmore about ageism acted as a painful reminder of
my own circumstances (March 20).
In July, 1991, I was made redundant by General Accident after 27
years' service. I was 44 at the time and totally shattered by this
experience. Long-term unemployment and serious nervous illness followed
on from the redundancy.
Four years and 500 job applications later I am still jobless and
virtually unemployable due to my age (48). My faith in employers has
disappeared rapidly after being told by so many: ''Sorry, we were
looking for somebody a bit younger.'' Most employers openly admitted to
only being interested in applicants under 35.
My experience is not unique. Over two million people are currently
suffering from age discrimination. It is a rapidly growing national
disease and we need legislation now to stop it in its tracks before it
destroys our workforce and our country.

I am neither a spotty-faced kid nor a man who wears anoraks but a lady
of 60-plus years who is very much interested and aware of the new
technology and has been for at least a couple of years.
If Mr Laing had children at primary school he would only need to ask

is a proving a tremendous educational source of information.

I WAS dismayed to read Kenneth Clarke's comments with regard to Mr
Pennant- Rea's resignation from his position as deputy governor of the
Bank of England.
Mr Pennant-Rea held a job which commanded much respect and trust.
Society expected, quite rightly, that his behaviour should be correct
morally, socially, and politically. By engaging in an extramarital
affair his sense of right and wrong, trust and loyalty were therefore in
conflict with these views.
Mr Clarke's endorsement of this affair surely makes a mockery of the
Government's family-values and back-to-basics campaigns.
Marriage is sacrosanct, based on mutual trust and respect for their
respective partners. It's right that his resignation was tendered and
accepted.

I READ with considerable interest of the relaunch of the Glasgow
Chamber of Commerce, and any re-focused effort to assist in the
development of trade, and in particular export trade, is to be welcomed.
All aspects of business are generally beset by rules, regulations, and
legislation which are often seen as hindrances but which businesses
recognise and take heed of.
It therefore comes as somewhat of a surprise to find that the Glasgow
Chamber of Commerce, in its positive effort to support the City of
Glasgow, is advising people that they can reach other major cities in
the UK by road in rather exceptional times, viz:
* Aberdeen -- 156 miles in 2 hours 30 minutes.
* Birmingham -- 304 miles in 4 hours 25 minutes.
* Edinburgh -- 47 miles in 45 minutes.
* London -- 421 miles in 6 hours 13 minutes.
* Manchester -- 225 miles in 3 hours 19 minutes.
To achieve these travelling times would require average speeds of
62.4mph, 68.84mph, 62.67mph, 67.73mph, and 67.85mph respectively.
As a regular traveller on the M8 from Glasgow to Edinburgh, I do well
to achieve an average speed of 40-45mph and I would like to be advised
of how chamber of commerce personnel can reach the above-mentioned
averages. They certainly are not recognising a 70mph speed limit!

F M TRISTRAM is quite right to ask for a well-informed debate about
future transport policy (March 25). He must however realise that lorries
are only as safe, clean, efficient, and environmentally friendly as
their operators make them.
Hauliers who are operating to tight schedules with small profit
margins will be tempted to cut corners and costs wherever possible.
There are too many lorries on the road which are dangerously faulty due
to skimped maintenance and neglect, and too many examples of lorry
drivers disregarding the safety of themselves and other road-users in
order to meet often unreasonable delivery schedules, as any police video
will show.
Trucks have been getting progressively heavier, faster, and greater in
number, and the worn-out main roads and persistent sickly stench of
diesel smoke in city centres and motorways contradict Mr Tristram's
assertion of cleaner quieter vehicles which cause less wear to the road.
I appreciate commercial realities, but any debate must appreciate the
need to provide realistic alternatives to excessive use of roads for
moving freight, eg intermodal road/rail travel. It can be done.

IAN Bell embroiders the often-told tale about the death of the
Communist Party in his review of Francis Becket's Enemy Within, and
notes that, had the party survived, it would be today celebrating its
75th anniversary (March 13).
As the current Scottish secretary of the Communist Party of Britain I
am writing to correct the record. The Communist Party is not dead. And
there will be a 75th anniversary celebration.
It takes place over the weekend of March 31 and April 2 and will be
attended by the ambassadors of Cuba and Vietnam and, on behalf of the
German PDS, by the last head of state of the German Democratic Republic,
Hans Modrow. The event will include a theoretical seminar attended by
representatives of 13 European communist parties.
Communists still stand for socialism. We do not believe that a world
dominated by the unaccountable power of big business is compatible with
the development of a truly human society. Nor, judging by the election
results from Eastern Europe, do the people there -- just four years
after the ''fall of Communism''.
The Communist Party of Britain was formed in 1988 by the thousands of
people who were expelled or excluded from the CPGB as a result of an
internal coup conducted by a group who today claim they are neither
Marxists nor Socialists.
It is perhaps no coincidence that the former editor of Marxism Today,
Martin Jacques, is today one of the strongest supporters of Tony Blair's
similar coup against Clause 4 in the Labour Party.

YOUR reader who experienced difficulty in buying tickets for Evelyn
Glennie's BT-sponsored concert in Paisley may like to know that there
were very solid reasons for not accepting cheques in payment (March 20).
All proceeds from the concert -- one of nine on her 1995 BT in the
Community tour -- are going to local charities. In the case of Paisley,
victims of the recent flood disaster will benefit.
The box-office at Paisley Town Hall, which undertook to sell tickets
for the concert, is run by Renfrew District Council, which charges a
handling fee for bookings made by cheque or credit card. The town-hall
staff therefore felt that to maximise the amount raised for local flood
victims tickets should be paid for in cash only. BT was not involved at
any stage in the running of the box-office.
Your reader also says she had to produce the correct money to buy
tickets. This is certainly not the council's policy, and the claim is
being investigated in detail.
BT is proud of its three-year association with the world's leading
percussionist, and disappointed that something which has brought a great
deal of pleasure to thousands of people, and raised thousands of pounds
for charity, has attracted such negative comment.

WHILE bad publicity has affected the income of the RSSPCC over the
past few years, a change of name will most certainly cause a further
drop in income and further confusion (March 17).
Take for example the charity Birthright, which changed its name to
WellBeing. Since the change it would seem that the charity has had to
overcome enormous difficulties in fund-raising due to a lack of
recognition of the new name.
The RSSPCC should take a lesson from this and reconsider its decision
to change the name. It should seek more positive alternatives to
increase income and save further outlay on a publicity campaign.

TIME tends to have a nasty, contemptuous way with government
legislation; the fears which fuelled over-zealous measures fade in the
light of experience. More crucially with a good deal of the legislation
of the past decade, any hasty and careless drafting leaves complex
regulation with more holes than a piece of Belgian lace. So it is with
government measures in the mid-eighties designed to regulate building
societies as they moved into the brave new world of enhanced duties and
opportunities. The Building Societies Act of 1986 positively quivers
with fears and bogymen. Government ministers fretted over the
possibility that rumoured takeovers by other building societies, or
opportunities to convert to banking status, would send gallons of hot
money sloshing between the different societies as investors hopped about
from one to another in the hope of a quick and substantial killing. The
consequences of this sort of action, if it had happened, would have been
to seriously destabilise the less attractive building societies. In
retrospect this seems hopelessly overstated. The context in which the
fears arose is the often ridiculous behaviour of professional investors
in the City, many of whom have the nerves, steadiness, and mental
composure of a lemming. Weld to this institutional skittishness a desire
to make money and you have exactly the sort of people who jump at
rumours and send their money, hot, tepid, or purely notional, flooding
from one investment opportunity to another.
By and large these are not the sort of people who invest in building
societies. This has been recognised in a significant judgment in the
High Court in London which will allow the Halifax and Leeds Permanent to
proceed with their merger. The point at issue which brought the action
to the court was the merger proposal which would have allowed investors
of less than two years' standing to benefit materially from the merger.
This is precisely the group suspected of potential society-hopping in
the hope of a quick gain. Mr Justice Chadwick recognised that this would
be a most unlikely outcome, presumably, if for no other reason than the
fact that only a few building societies would be attractive targets for
merger or transformation into banks. The extreme difficulty of anyone
spotting in advance the ones likely to change is also a deterrent to
society-hopping which has now been properly recognised.
The upshot of all this is that some eight million investors are likely
to benefit substantially if the merger between the Halifax and the Leeds
Permanent proceeds. The lion's share will still go to investors with
reasonable share balances who have been in the Halifax for at least two
years, but everyone else, including borrowers, pensioners, employees,
and all other shareholders with a minimum stake will also benefit.
Current and deposit-account holders, to their infinite regret, will not.
This is pleasant for those involved, but we are left wondering if there
is any general benefit to be had from mergers of this sort and the
emergence of a new bank. As far as banking and the general public is
concerned, this must be doubted. The clearing banks are not in good
odour with either the public or small businessmen at the moment. Their
drive for profits has been a public relations disaster, leaving
impressions of many unemployed, truncated services, poorly treated
staff, and richly rewarded boardrooms. It is possible that the new
banking entity which is planned to emerge from the merging of the
Halifax and Leeds Permanent may surpass the existing banks in service
and value for money but we see no reason why this should be so. The
restrictive legislation on the current mergers is interpreted too
tightly and this has been recognised, but the result is yet another
financial merry-go-round which will do little for the greater good or
for the productive capacity of the nation. Indeed, there is a
possibility of substantial redundancies because of the merger. Good luck
to the eight million; we remain unimpressed.

<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979157227</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Isle of Eigg and its 80-or-so residents have been sold, passed
like a parcel from one rich man to another. The laws of libel do not
allow the fullest or most frank revelation of all that transpired on
this small and beautiful place during the ownership of Mr Keith
Schellenberg. Suffice to say that he found his tenants difficult and
that they reciprocated the feelings. What is undeniable is that Eigg is
not a good example of a well-run Highland estate. It is fertile but does
not seem to bear much agricultural fruit. The islanders, whether
incomers or not, possess as a whole sufficient talents to create decent
housing, but the housing on offer is distinctly variable. Over and above
the usual problems suffered by remote communities in Scotland, there
seems little reason for the old, and even less for the young, to remain
on Eigg.
It is futile to blame this state of affairs on the appalling
relationship which developed between Mr Schellenberg, who has owned the
island on-and-off for many years, and his tenants. Obviously matters
would have been better, and Eigg would have been an easier and more
pleasant place to live, if landlord and tenants had been able to work
together creatively. That they have not is a source of infinite regret,
and yet another ugly stain on the history of land and ownership in the
Highlands and Islands. Nor was the local authority in Lochaber able to
do very much about the state of affairs on Eigg as matters deteriorated
over recent years. The key to the proper management of Eigg, with all
its recent problems, is that the type of ownership which exists over the
islands is inappropriate to Eigg in particular and to fragile, small
communities in general.
The new owner of Eigg may, or may not, be able to improve matters with
his new tenants. Whether he is a German mystic artist or a Zoroastrian
priest is not of the greatest importance. What is vitally important is
that he understands, or is enabled to understand, the peculiar
difficulties under which Eigg labours, and that he has the sensitivity
and the commonsense to develop strategies in concert with his tenants
for the future. This is in theory not too much to ask. We will, however,
have to wait and see. In the meantime, the recent history of Eigg should
be taken as an example of how this sort of affair should not be managed.
Small and fragile communities are not best-suited to private ownership
unless it is of a sensitivity not normally seen. There is a trend in the
Highlands at the moment for some sporting estates to be taken into
public ownership for environmental and conservation reasons. While it is
important to conserve landscape and wildlife, it is much more important
to conserve humankind. Public ownership in partnership with tenants is
the only way in which the absurdities of Eigg and other places can be
resolved. The Highlands and Islands without people are nothing; we
should remember that.

NO-ONE really knows why the elections for the new councils are being
held in April as opposed to the normal date in May. Or at least no-one
will admit to being the evil genius who condemned canvassers to dark
nights, cold winds, and now, at the end of March, trudging to doorsteps
through the snow and ice.
My own pet theory is suitably Machiavellian. The Tories are not much
given to doorstep canvassing these days. They prefer the more
comfortable phone canvass and it therefore suits the Government to keep
the other parties off the streets and quite literally in the dark.
Even where the Tories are still street canvassing it is probably
helpful for their more nervous activists not to run the risk of being
recognised in the light of day. Against this theory is the view that the
demoralised Tory vote is actually less likely to turn out in poor
weather.
This was once conceded by a former Scottish Tory Chairman, on hearing
that his candidate had been narrowly beaten into last place in a local
election in Motherwell by the Communist Party, quickly suggested that
the weather had been too cold for the Tory support!
However it is not cold canvassers that we should worry about but cold
people and Scotland's enduring problem of fuel poverty amid energy
plenty.
In the bleak mid spring of Scotland one real local government
initiative is shining out like a beacon and that is the ''Warm Up for
Winter'' campaigns currently being pursued by both Grampian and Tayside
regions.
These have already provided tens of thousands of free lunches for old
folk at lunch clubs and meals on wheels from Portsoy to Dundee saving an
average of #20-#30 per customer over the past three months.
That in itself is successful enough but the real breakthrough of the
campaigns has been the impact of energy advice and counselling from the
Freephone helplines established in both regions.
The full impact of practical energy advice is difficult to measure but
the follow-on benefit checks alone have generated an estimated extra
million pounds identified as underclaimed by Tayside pensioners.
The transformation of individual prospects is difficult to
overestimate. William Todd is a former dairyman from Crief who suffers
from a heart condition and endures the severe dizziness brought on by
Munieres disease. His weekly income has now been increased by almost
#40. In William's case that represents an increase of almost 50%.
To my certain knowledge a frail elderly couple in Aberdeen have had
their joint income increased by over #100 a week as a result of the
''Warm Up for Winter'' initiative identifying attendance allowance and
severe disability claims.
That spectacular result will be well at the top end of additional
benefits but the point is that these campaigns are making a real
difference to real people.
Then there is the impact of direct assistance with fuel bills by
helping the local voluntary organisations like Scarf in Grampian and Age
Concern.
I freely concede that both SNP administrations arrived at the ''Warm
Up for Winter'' campaign through a circuitous route having had our
original proposal of a direct #10 payment knocked back as potentially
illegal for regional councils -- although not interestingly for district
councils where SNP-run West Lothian is now into its second year of
direct payments.
However, surely the point is this. Having encountered the legal
obstacles the administrations didn't give up as was suggested by the
unionist twins, Tory and Labour. They stuck at it until they found an
initiative which the North-east pensioners' spokesperson, Bill Knight,
has described as ''better than the #10 payment''.
Now the real task is to spread the success of the ''Warm Up for
Winter'' around the rest of Scotland so that all old age pensioners have
the opportunity to share in the benefits. Given that Labour, in
particular, have spent much of this campaign rubbishing the initiative
then that means a fresh start by replacing Labour control with SNP
administration.
All election campaigns have their moments of farce as well as
seriousness and all of us find ourselves in situations we would rather
not handle.
George Robertson probably wishes he hadn't appeared in Aberdeen to
attack Grampian region on the very day the SNP/Liberal administration
was voted the best-run council in the UK.
Equally it was a tad unwise of Brian Wilson to claim that the ''Warm
Up for Winter'' initiative in Tayside was put in place by the previous
Labour administration when their total spend was #7000 compared to the
#503,000 in the current campaign. Perhaps the Keir Hardie House brief
needs updated.
Meanwhile in Grampian the Labour Party combined with the Tories in
December in a vain attempt to stop some of the most successful aspects
of the initiative.
At the end of the day it will not be George or Brian, or for that
matter Alex, who will decide this election. Our votes are already
determined. The people will judge for themselves and one factor will be
on the basis of what their council has tried to do or indeed failed to
do.
Back in Crief, just off the main street, William Todd is in little
doubt of the verdict on ''Warm Up for Winter''. He is reported as simply
saying, ''It's been marvellous.''

I AM getting tired of all this talk of devolution and independence for
Scotland as being the answer to all our problems in the country.
As a Scot whose maternal grandfather was a bread salesman, and whose
paternal grandfather was a factory worker, I would say that conditions
have improved over the years.
North Sea oil has been a godsend to Great Britain, bringing a lot of
work to Scotland and helping the economy, but unlike Alex Salmond I
wouldn't claim it as being Scottish oil. If this had to be the basis of
our independence, what happens when supplies run out?

Christopher Sims reports on a smooth start to the proposed merger
between the Halifax and Leeds building societies -- but there could be a
long wait for the windfall
THE planned merger between the Halifax Building Society and Leeds
Permanent is having a far smoother run than Lloyds' Bank's takeover of
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester (C&amp;G).
The Halifax and Leeds merger was announced out of the blue last
November and already the first major hurdle has been surmounted, with
the go-ahead yesterday for the plan from the High Court.
This means that the original terms for the merger can now proceed,
paving the way for a windfall, estimated at up to #800 for savers and
borrowers in both societies. They will still have a long wait because
the payout will be in the form of shares in the merged society when
these are quoted on the stock market and this may take another two
years.
Members of both societies will shortly be called on to vote for the
merger, probably in May.
In comparison to this smooth progression, the Lloyds Bank takeover of
C&amp;G has become an obstacle course. The deal was first mooted in April
1994 but C&amp;G was taken aback when the High Court rejected the proposals.
The terms of the deal had to be rejigged and it will be voted on this
Friday. However C&amp;G directors have already been forced to sit through a
humiliating harangue from disaffected members, including borrowers, who
were excluded for one reason or another from the cash windfall. The
Halifax decision will anger them further but has come too late to impact
on the important C&amp;G postal vote.
The Halifax has of course learned from C&amp;G's experience in formulating
its proposals and it had the advantage in wanting to distribute shares
rather than cash.
The rewards for members of the societies fall into two parts. There
will be a distribution of a fixed number of shares to investor and
borrower members so long as they held or owed not less than #100 on
November 25 last. In addition investor members will qualify for further
shares pro rata to their balances between #1000 and #50,000 on November
25. Should the balance fall below the level on this date the number of
the shares will be reduced.
The value of the shares is impossible to predict when flotation of the
enlarged Halifax is so far away but on present figures the group would
have a value of at least #8000m and all this sum would belong to the
members. The bulk of the free shares will be reserved for the fixed
amount to be given to all members. As there are a total of 10,000,000
members in both societies the share payout will be worth up to #800.
Holders of current or deposit accounts are not members and do not
qualify for anything -- which will leave some people extremely irate. It
certainly does seem unfair that people with deposit accounts are
excluded for what amounts to a technicality. From the investors' point
of view there is little difference between deposit accounts and share
accounts, which have the rights of ownership.
Even if the societies wanted to do something for these people, the
1986 Building Societies Act excludes this as it says that only members
can vote and investor members are defined as those with share accounts.
There is nothing depositors can do and the merger will almost
certainly be voted through. A 75% majority is required from investors
and 50% from borrowers.
The only carping will be the length of time they will have to wait for
their reward. Given its very strong financial position Halifax could
easily afford to make an interim payment in cash. However this would
greatly complicate already complex proposals and borrowers would not be
allowed to participate.
The takeover of C&amp;G and the Halifax/Leeds merger (though it is also
effectively a takeover) marks the profound changes taking place in the
financial services industry. The market is moving rapidly towards
one-stop shopping for products like mortgages, life assurance, home
insurance, savings, and pensions and it is thought that only those
companies able to provide the full range will be among the high street
majors.
Halifax, and Abbey National before it, considers that only as a public
company quoted on the Stock Exchange can it have the flexibility it will
require to be among the top rank in a highly competitive industry.
However this argument carries much less weight than it did because
restrictions on what societies can offer have been greatly reduced.
Halifax itself has just started its own life assurance and pensions
company and also offers household insurance. It has also set up a
mortgage business in Spain.
A more important argument in favour of becoming a public company is
that the society feels restrained because of its mutual status. Being
owned by its investors and borrowers rather than risk-taking
shareholders makes it reluctant to start new ventures which always
entail some uncertainty.
This could be turned round -- mutual status imposes discipline so that
risky adventures are avoided. It would be no more in the interests of
savers for Halifax to take risks as a public company than it would if
Halifax remained a mutual. There is little chance of it doing anything
irresponsible in coming years because it will have its hands full in
developing existing activities.
But the mistakes other banks have made in the past does not inspire
confidence for the longer term.
Going public will yield few benefits for Halifax's members apart from
the shares they will receive and opponents allege it is the game
familiar enough in the Government's privatisations of top management
wanting to line their own pockets with high salaries and lucrative share
options.
But few are going to reject the deal on these grounds and Halifax is
not going to be the last society to drop mutuality. Indeed removal of
the flagship mutual building society weakens the whole idea, with
possible long-term implications for the Scottish life assurance industry
which is dominated by mutuals.
Perhaps as far as building societies are concerned they will
eventually revert to their original aim of providing local funds for
local homebuyers. There is no reason why such niche societies could not
compete with the high street giants.

HRH expands into East Kilbride with soft drinks. Cameron Simpson
reports on the Prince's business acumen
WHEN a biographer comes to draw up the balance sheet of public
utterances by the Prince of Wales, it is likely to find the him rooted
in the red.
With his cartoon-friendly ears, Prince Charles has, over the years,
provided the tabloids with added ammunition for their caricatures, with
his statements on:
* Plants: ''I just come and talk to them -- they respond, I find.''
* The Luftwaffe and planners: ''When it knocked down our buildings, it
didn't replace them with anything more offensive than rubble. We did
that.''
* Modern architecture: ''Like a monstrous carbuncle on the face of an
old friend.''
However, when it comes to business, it is likely that the figures, and
not the figures of speech, will be writ large in black, revealing a side
to the Prince of Wales that is only slowly emerging -- the Prince as
successful entrepreneur.
The latest addition to the Prince's portfolio came yesterday when it
was announced that he is to sell herbal soft drinks in a deal with
Coca-Cola and Schweppes which will raise thousands of pounds for his
charities.
Duchy No 1 and Duchy No 3 go on sale tomorrow at between #2.20 and
#2.45 a bottle. They are the latest offerings from Duchy Originals -- a
firm set up by the Duchy of Cornwall.
Three years ago, it began selling Duchy Originals biscuits, which are
made in Scotland. Boxes of the exclusive oaten and gingered biscuits,
baked by Walkers of Aberlour, grace the shelves of top people's food
halls and are now on sale in France, Germany, the United States, Canada,
the Irish Republic, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Oman.
Bearing the Duke of Cornwall's coat of arms, the biscuits -- which are
baked from organic malted wheat harvested on the Duchy of Cornwall's
Home Farm -- have already trebled their sales in the UK. Profits go to
charity.
The new drinks will be blended and bottled in East Kilbride by the
Coca-Cola and Schweppes factory, which employs 280 people. No 1 is red
and includes apple and raspberry juice, elderflower and sage. No 3 is
white and includes apple and pear juice and fennel.
Some ingredients come from the royal estate at Sandringham, Norfolk,
and a farm adjoining the Prince's home at Highgrove, Gloucestershire.
It is hoped to sell more than 1,000,000 bottles over the next year at
selected shops, with thousands of pounds going to the Prince's
charities.
The new venture comes hard on the heels of the news that Prince
Charles has also agreed a deal with the Walt Disney studios to market a
video of a story he wrote 25 years ago -- The Legend of Lochnagar.
The Legend of Lochnagar, based on a story the Prince wrote for his
brothers when they were children, will be sold across the United States
and Canada. The deal is expcted to raise more than #1m.
The half-hour animated version, made by Welsh TV station S4C in a
co-production with the BBC, has already been screened on TV in Britain,
America and other countries.
Of a report that it could raise #1m for the Prince, he said:
''Obviously it is too soon for anyone to know. It all depends on the
sales -- it could fall flat on its face or it could do even better.''
There was also the possibility of a publishing tie-up, giving US sales
for a book-of-the-video which had already been available in Britain, he
said.
However, the engine room of the Prince's finances is the Duchy of
Cornwall estate, which was set up in 1337 by Edward III for the Black
Prince. Today it consists mainly of some 300 farms in south-west
England, Dartmoor, the Scilly Isles, commercial properties and a UK
Stock Exchange portfolio.
It is managed by the Prince's Council and its main aim is to provide
an income for the heir to the throne and his family. In 1993 it netted
him an income of #4m.
In public, it is portrayed as a rather quaint organisation collecting
peppercorn rents from a few happy tenants and making biscuits for
tourists. Its officials cling to their ancient titles such as Lord
Warden of the Stannaries and Receiver General, and make much of the fact
that the Prince -- as Duke of Cornwall -- is entitled to receive
tributes of firewood and roast sheep.
But beneath the facade of feudal inefficiency, the Duchy is run, not
by courtiers, but by a team of hard-headed businessmen with a treasury
of experience of British industry, making it is one of the richest
private estates in Europe and by far the wealthiest in Britain.
The duchy's 1993 accounts, the latest available, show income of #9.1m,
mainly from farm rentals and commercial ventures. Deductible running
costs were #5.6m. Added to the #3.5m operating surplus is #1m income
from the duchy's #40m investment portfolio, plus #670,000 in interest on
bank deposits.
The net profit of #4,082,951 for the Prince -- an increase of #600,000
on the previous year -- is arrived at after deductions of #1m in
interest payable on loans and transfer of #92,851 to reserves.
Like all good businessmen, the Prince has a vast contacts book. Some
100 of the world's top corporate executives answered the call when the
Prince set up his Business Leaders Forum in Charleston, in the US. At
the time, the town's mayor said it was the biggest thing to hit the Deep
South since Hurricane Hugo.
Hyperbole aside, if the Prince continues the way, he is going he is
set to reap a whirlwind of profit.

Animal abusers come in all shapes and sizes, from callous toff to
thoughtless farmhand.
Anne Johnstone uses shocking statistics to build up a picture of the
typical offender
THE quote leaped from the page: ''Seemed like fun at the time.'' This
particular enjoyable activity turned out to be drowning a pet dog, and
this was how its owner explained his actions to the police. Once the
greyhound bitch was dead and buried, he didn't expect to be caught, but
an anonymous tip-off to the Scottish Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals and the determination of one of its inspectors led to
the corpse being exhumed and landed this particular sadist in court. He
was fined #200.
This case, from Armadale in West Lothian, is one of 129 reported to
the procurator-fiscal by the charity last year. It forms part of a
continuing upward spiral of neglect and abuse of dumb animals. Last year
for the first time the society's 47 inspectors received more than
100,000 calls for help from concerned members of the public and other
animal welfare groups. That's twice as many as five years ago. Nearly
11,000 animals were given a haven in one of their 13 animal welfare
centres and more than 4000 investigations were carried out.
Frustratingly, nearly the only figure in the report which isn't a record
is the number of animal cruelty cases dealt with in court. Because of
the immense logjam of cases, only one-quarter of those lodged with the
fiscal's office last year have yet reached court.
In recent years the SSPCA has tended to blame the recession for the
rapid rise in its caseload but now admits to concern that the figures
are continuing to shoot up. The economy has certainly played a large
part in the sharp increase in farm animal welfare cases.
''Farmers who are really struggling on the breadline should think
about giving up. Someone running a business can just switch off the
electricity and walk away when things go wrong but on a farm it's the
animals which suffer,'' says the society's chief executive Jim Morris.
In January 42-year-old farmer Colin Baxter was jailed for three months
after SSPCA inspectors uncovered horrific scenes on visits to his farm
at Kirknewton, West Lothian, last year. The unburied carcasses of
malnourished sheep were scattered across farmland. Calves and pigs,
belly-deep in dung and slurry, were crammed into old outbuildings. More
decomposing carcasses were floating in a flooded pit.
Is the apparent increase in animal cruelty a symptom of a deeper
malaise in society? Morris believes there has always existed a hard core
of wilful animal abusers: ''They will go on abusing one animal after
another. The same individuals will be involved in dogfighting, then
badger baiting, then cockfighting.''
Who are they? They come in all shapes and sizes, of course, from the
callous toff to a thoughtless farmhand. But from statistics compiled by
the society we can build up a picture of a typical abuser: he is male,
probably unemployed, and aged between 25 and 34. In farm animal welfare
cases the average age is higher and nearly 80% of the offenders owned
the animals they ill-treated.
There is increasing evidence of links between one type of abuse and
another, a phenomenon known as ''the cycle of abuse''. English social
worker Stuart Hutton has researched links between animal and child
abuse. In his study more than 80% of families with a history of animal
abuse had been notified to the social services as having children at
risk. And in 88% of families in which childen had been abused, pets had
also been abused.
So whatever happened to Britain's reputation as a nation of animal
lovers? It is still intact, says Jim Morris, pointing out that of the
4000 cases investigated last year barely 100 ended in court cases.
''Very few people abuse animals wilfully. Most cases we handle involve
ignorance.''
One theory is that animal charities are busier not because people are
more cruel to animals but less. Pauline Mullin of the SSPCA believes
people are more aware of what constitutes cruelty, such as drowning a
litter of kittens.
Though the SSPCA is the only animal charity which rescues abused
animals, many others campaign about aspects of animal welfare, and
raised public awareness has bought the society more work. Campaigns
fought by the society for many years, such as the export of live animals
for slaughter, have suddenly been taken up by a wider public and welfare
goups with more radical agendas. This has proved a mixed blessing for
the SSPCA. Jim Morris is delighted that live exports are at the top of
the political agenda after years of investigations and complaints by his
inspectors but regrets the way a number of different issues have been
thrown together in a confusing melting pot.
''There are at least four issues here: the transport of animals; the
transport of animals for slaughter; veal crates; and the situation
regarding slaughter houses.''
One of the biggest factors in the SSPCA's increasing workload is a new
willingness within the farming community to expose and condemn those who
flout the laws on animal cruelty. ''At one time the farming community
closed ranks, believing that any bad pubicity reflected on all of them.
Now they know that if they cover up for the bad boys, it doesn't do them
any good,'' says Pauline Mullin.
The paradox is that grim statistics from the SSPCA may be a sign of
hope.

PROBABLY no man knew Willie McRae better than Len Murray,
distinguished Glasgow criminal lawyer, consummate after-dinner speaker,
prominent Burnsian, and now consultant at Glasgow law firm, Levy and
McRae.
Murray was first McRae's pupil then, for 22 years, his partner. His --
Murray's -- is recognised in legal circles and in Scottish society as a
first-rate forensic brain. He has been at the heart of the defence in
many of the most celebrated Scottish court cases of the past 25 years,
acknowledging McRae as a seminal influence in his early career. In the
matter of McRae he is unlikely to be misled or fooled. He has, until
now, kept his own counsel about McRae's later years and his
controversial death.
Ten years on his fondness for McRae is undiminished but he does not
disguise the realities of the last period. McRae, he says, was probably
not an outright alcoholic, although he was certainly in his later years
a problem drinker. This tended to exaggerate the enormous mood swings to
which McRae was subject -- far greater mood swings than any ordinary
person would experience.
It is possible to deduce from Len Murray's descriptions that McRae
either suffered clinical depression or something close to it. After he
parted company with Levy and McRae there is evidence from many sources
that his business affairs were a pale shadow of Willie McRae in his
legal prime. There were pathetic attempts to poach clients.
There were occasions, which Len Murray speaks about with some
reluctance, when his former partner was suicidal, occasions when friends
came to the rescue. He was aware that McRae possessed -- illegally -- a
handgun which he kept in his safe and which he had threatened to use on
himself.
Len Murray is dismissive of conspiracy theories. The available
evidence points to his brilliant but unstable friend eventually taking
his own life and good lawyers work on the basis of the evidence which
exists and which they have tested to destruction.
He is currently working on a book which will, inevitably, concentrate
on the law in Scotland and its characters. The following is part of one
chapter of that book -- an important and deeply personal profile of the
late Willie McRae.

Len Murray gives his personal view on the life and death of former
colleague and friend, Willie McRae
HE DIED on April 6, 1985, aged 61, and controversy still surrounds his
death. Many, particularly among the Scottish Nationalists, maintained
that he was murdered. They maintained that the Secret Service had killed
him because of his political views. For Willie McRae believed
passionately in the Nationalist cause. He had been a vice-president of
the Scottish National Party but his was an extreme brand of nationalism
which was not universally popular within the party. The extremists made
him a martyr; they formed the Willie McRae Society and indeed they
erected a cairn to his memory near the spot where he was found.
There never has been an official verdict on Willie McRae's death
because there was never any official public inquiry. Those who
maintained that Willie was murdered by the security services or the
national intelligence forces because of his extreme nationalist beliefs
campaigned long and hard to try and persuade the Lord Advocate to hold a
fatal accident inquiry. The Lord Advocate, who canvassed the views of
Willie's family before coming to a decision, decided not to hold one. I
imagine that that was in accordance with the wishes of his family but,
as a result of there having been no inquiry, the rather emotional idea
that Willie was murdered by the Secret Service was given credence and
was never finally dispelled.
I honestly do not understand how it is that such a conclusion could be
reached upon so little information because there is precious little
information within the public domain. Any that is there is the result of
gossip, rumour or speculation.
The report on the post-mortem examination which was conducted on his
body was quite rightly never made known. That report would have
contained vital information upon, among other things, the wounds which
Willie sustained.
We have no idea if there was bruising or soot or tattooing around the
wound or any of the tell-tale signs of close-range entry. Indeed so far
as I am aware there is no relevant information on the wounds at all. A
great deal can be told by expert forensic examination of gun-shot
wounds.
The distance of the gun from the body is another vital piece of
information. There is no authoritative information available so far as I
am aware on either of these two vital areas. In the absence of that
information it is impossible to reach any informed conclusion.
A hand gun believed to have fired the fatal shot was found near the
body and the precise spot where that was found could also shed light on
what caused Willie's death. If it were found beyond perhaps a distance
of about one metre from the body then that would tend (I put it no
higher than that) to indicate something other than suicide. But even
that must depend upon, for example, the lie of the ground.
I also have this difficulty with what I call the ''liquidator
theory''. If officialdom were behind Willie McRae's death then why leave
doubt about it? It would be a matter of unbridled astonishment to me if
it were seriously suggested that a killing could not be dressed up to
look like suicide. Instead he was killed, according to the proponents of
the liquidator theory, in such a way that there is apparently room for
some doubt as to cause of death. Besides, why on earth should a
liquidator leave the weapon (if it were the murder weapon) near the body
at all?
In my naivety I have difficulty in believing that in this country we
have any official liquidators who get rid of people with unacceptable
political views. Why should Willie McRae be singled out? What was so
unique about his political views that he alone of all politicians in
recent years has met such a fate? Those who believe in the liquidator
can point to no other politician in recent years who may have been
killed off in this way.
It may be that Willie was murdered for some reason other than his
politics although no-one has ever come up with one. Personally I tend to
believe that Willie died at his own hands.
I probably knew Willie McRae better than most. I first met him in 1954
when I was introduced to him by the headmaster of my former school and I
became Willie's apprentice. When my apprenticeship finished I was his
assistant for several months and thereafter (after an interval of one
year) I became his partner. We remained in partnership for 22 years
until he left the firm in 1981.
Let no-one criticise or judge him over the matter of his death. Let
no-one cast the first stone. If he did take his own life then when it
comes to the final accounting there will be very many credits on the
balance-sheet of his life, credits which are likely far to outweigh any
debit brought about by his peccadillos or by the manner of his death.
Not only did he fight like a tiger when he believed that right was on
his side but he did more for young people coming into the legal
profession than anyone else I know. He devoted endless time and went to
endless trouble to assist those who needed his help. Many a member of
the legal profession practising in Scotland today owes his presence or
his continued presence in the profession to Willie.
Willie McRae was one of the most unforgettable characters I ever knew
-- indeed I can think of none more unforgettable. He was a man of great
intellect with a superb ability to identify issues. He had a razor-sharp
mind and a wit to match it. But he was also a man of great emotion; the
emotional pendulum could swing probably further with him than with any
other I knew.
He had a lot of professional and personal worry at the time of his
death and he was so supercharged with emotion that he was very liable to
succumb to the pressure of it all and take his own life. That is what I
believe happened. That, however, is something between Willie and his
Creator, a Creator incidentally in whom he always believed.
He was unique and often outrageous. But his outrageousness was such
that the profession in the main not only accepted it but rather
grudgingly admired it. That was Willie; that was how people viewed him.
Even so, at times the letters which he wrote often made me cringe. He
did not hesitate to say exactly what he thought. Not for him the
diplomacy of the professional letter-writer; rather he preferred a
bluntness which was frequently positively embarrassing. On occasion he
was blunt to the point of rudeness.
He once wrote to a professional colleague (one I may say who was a
pain in the teeth and whose principal concern was trumpeting his own
importance) in the following terms: ''When we first met you'' (to us his
partners the pronoun was regrettably all too often the plural) ''we
formed the view that you were a fool. Nothing has happened in the
intervening 30 years to make us change our mind.''
He had a wonderful sense of humour. On one occasion an old lady (who
incidentally trusted him and his judgment implicitly and used to come to
see him about every little hiccup in her life) had a fire in her home.
She turned as a matter of course to Willie for advice on what to do. The
first thing was obviously to advise her insurers of the fire and
initiate a claim under her insurance policy.
Most of us in these circumstances would have written the rather dull,
formal letter asking them to forward a claim form but the predictable
was seldom what one could expect from Willie McRae who wrote to Sun
Alliance in the following terms:
Dear Sirs,
Mrs E Neustein, Tae the tune o' Duncan Gray
Mrs Neustein's burnt her bum
Ha ha the burnin' o' it
She had her electric blanket on
Ha ha the singein o' it.
The blanket it burst into flame
Noo she wants tae mak a claim

Ha ha the claimin' o' it.
Not only did the insurers send a claim form but they settled the
lady's claim in double-quick time and with a smile on their face!
He was an orator par excellence -- a real old-fashioned rabble-rouser.
When he was on his feet whether in a court or a tribunal or on a
political platform the atmosphere could be charged up by him as few
before or after him were capable of doing.
In 1980 the Government ordered a planning inquiry which would become
known as the Mulwharcher Inquiry. It was all about an application for
planning permission from the Atomic Energy Authority which had caused
some public controversy. All the interested parties were represented by
learned and costly senior counsel -- all that is except Willie's
clients, the Scottish National Party, who were represented by him.
The Atomic Energy Authority were of course a party to the inquiry and
were among those who had instructed senior counsel. That counsel (now a
senator of the College of Justice and thus a Supreme Court Judge)
irritated Willie over several days. The transcript of the inquiry
records Willie as saying at one point:
''Would learned and courteous senior counsel either bridle his
arrogance or produce a display of ability sufficient to justify it,
neither of which he has done so far.''
That was so typical of the kind of comment that Willie would make when
the occasion required; unfortunately all too few of his comments are a
matter of record.
The unexpected was the norm for him. In the 1950s the Grand Orange
Lodge of Scotland, that pillar of ecumenism and Christian charity, had
as its Grand Master, the Rev Alan G Hasson of Bonhill, a minister who
was subsequently to flee to Canada and was eventually defrocked. On the
occasion to which I refer the Orange Walk had planned to make its way
along Gordon Street in the centre of Glasgow. Willie happened to be
lunching in the Grosvenor Restaurant then situated on the first floor of
the Grosvenor building in that street and at a table which gave him a
grandstand view of the march. He was along with two other solicitors and
a law student.
Willie adhered to no particular religious denomination but he was
utterly intolerant of intolerance, if you follow me. He regarded the
Orange Order as the epitome of intolerance and the Orange Walk as the
manifestation of that evil. And so he welcomed the opportunity of
displaying publicly his detestation of the whole affair.
When the Orange Walk turned into Gordon Street and drew level with the
Grosvenor, Willie's companions were astonished when he picked up a bread
roll from the table, eased up the casement window beside which he was
sitting and without introduction or warning or by-your-leave hurled the
roll through the open window towards the Grand Master as he rode past on
his white horse. The roll missed. Willie grunted in disappointment,
calmly shut the window and carried on with his conversation as though
nothing had ever happened.
Alan G Hasson subsequently became a client of mine but I never did
tell him of how one of my partners had once tried to hit him with a
bread roll!
Posterity will give Willie McRae his place. But before posterity makes
up its mind about him let it be said loud and clear that Willie McRae
was one of the most gifted, one of the most talented, and one of the
most generous of men. May he rest in the peace that only his Creator can
bring him.

IN AMERICA, they say, everyone gets 15 minutes of fame. Peter Capaldi
got his first 19 seconds yesterday when he walked on to the podium of
the Shrine Auditorium in LA and clutched a 14-inch high gold statuette
in his made-in-Bishopbriggs hands. It was the first Oscar for a purely
Scottish film in 34 years.
His short, Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life, financed by the
Scottish Film Production Fund and BBC Scotland, shared an Academy Award
for the best live action short film. As the film-maker rubbed shoulders
with Hollywood's finest at a glittering post-ceremony party, his 15
minutes looked assured. In fact, it looked like the beginning of a long
and beautiful friendship. Capaldi is a talented, witty, and intelligent
young man whose time has finally come. He will surely now go on to
become one of Britain's most successful film directors.
With customary modesty he admitted later that he had been approached
by ''a few movie people''. In fact, they have been beating a path to his
LA hotel door all week. If Hollywood loves anything, it loves a winner.
You don't get a second prize in the Oscars.
Franz Kafka, a surreal black comedy made for #30,000 three years ago
in the first batch of the BBC's Tartan Shorts scheme, starred Richard E
Grant and Elaine Collins, Capaldi's actress wife. It would be churlish
not to point out that, in a rare Oscar twist, it tied for yesterday's
Oscar with an American short film, Trevor.
Both Capaldi and the film serve to prove that rejection in the showbiz
industry is not necessarily a bad thing. The actor failed to gain
entrance to drama college in Glasgow (and went instead to art school)
while the movie was turned down in somewhat snooty fashion by the London
Film Festival because the organisers did not think it was good enough.
BBC Scotland beamed a collective smile when news of the Oscar success
came through in the early hours of the morning. They even organised a
hugely expensive satellite link with LA to give the Scottish press an
opportunity to speak with Capaldi and head of television Colin Cameron,
who accompanied the film-maker to LA.
So what went through Capaldi's mind as he made the long walk towards
the stage with his producer and business partner, Ruth Kenley-Letts?
''I have to say that the only way I can describe it is it is sexual,''
he quipped. ''And then when you get up on the podium and you look down
and Steve Martin is looking at you and Jeremy Irons is there; you can
imagine it is a sensational kind of feeling.
''It is more than dreamlike. There you are surrounded by all these
people. In a strange way I don't think I was really nervous because I
didn't think we were going to win. But it is wonderful; a great
experience.''
Of the approaches which have been made to him during the past week in
Hollywood, Capaldi said: ''There is so much stuff going on it is hard to
figure out what is the right thing to do. What the award means to me is
that I now have some profile. I suppose it means that we will be able to
do some work which is funded and supported from over here.''
Asked what he thought would be the impact of the award on the Scottish
film industry, he commented: ''I would hope it means that there will be
greater confidence. One of the very, very exciting things I have found
here in LA is that no one talks to you about being Scottish. Whereas, if
you are in London and you are trying to put films together and be a
film-maker, there is a kind of unspoken sense that, if you are Scottish,
you have something to overcome or else you cannot really do that
project. Here (in LA) they talk to you completely as a film- maker.
''No one has once said to me 'What's it like in Scotland' or 'My, what
a lovely accent you have.' It is wonderful.''
Capaldi made his first significant breakthrough in Bill Forsyth's
Local Hero. He went on to feature in Dangerous Liaisons and the TV
movie, Selling Hitler. He wrote the script for the award-winning movie
Soft Top, Hard Shoulder, in which he also starred with his wife. Franz
Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life is his directorial debut.
He paid a warm tribute to BBC Scotland, where he started his career in
the costume department. ''I'd like to thank them, but not just for
funding this particular film. It was where I started. BBC Scotland is a
great place to learn,'' he said.
His Oscar is more than either BBC Scotland or the Scottish Film
Production Fund could ever have hoped for. The Tartan Shorts initiative
was set up specifically to address the problem of a lack of
opportunities for new Scottish film talent. Its future is now secure for
at least the next three years, according to BBC officials.
Colin Cameron said: ''The whole purpose of Tartan Shorts was to give
some kind of opportunity to individuals who have talent, to give them
confidence and I cannot think of any greater confidence booster than to
win an Oscar. It's very important that we encourage the talent base we
have in Scotland. We are doing as much as we can to develop it.''
Mr Eddie Dick, director of the Scottish Film Production Fund, said:
''In terms of film industry accolades, the Oscar is truly world class.
For Peter's film to have won this award is an extraordinary
achievement.''
Peter Capaldi is following in the footsteps of a highly select few
Scots who have made the stroll to the Oscar podium. The last was Sean
Connery in 1987 when he was awarded the prize for best supporting actor
for the movie The Untouchables. In 1980, the comedy film Dollar Bottom
won an Oscar in the short live action movie category. However, though it
was filmed in Scotland and starred Scottish actors, it was
English-financed. The last purely Scottish film to gain an Oscar was the
John Grierson documentary, Seaward The Great Ships, in 1960.
Sir Hector Monro, MP, Minister for the Arts at the Scottish Office,
has sent a letter of congratulations to Capaldi.
He said yesterday: ''I would like to offer my congratulations to Peter
Capaldi and everyone else who was involved in the making of the film.
This is not the first award which the film has received but it is
perhaps its finest moment.  This is a major achievement for Scottish
film-making.''

THERE's a scene well into Joe versus the Volcano where Tom Hanks, as
the average guy of the title, is all but lost at sea floating atop some
ridiculously expensive Vuitton-style luggage. The love of his life may
or may not be wiped out. She lies unconscious nearby.
Hanks's Joe Banks fiddles with his short-wave radio and something
bouncy from around Motown bursts out. Joe, in his designer and over-long
shorts, begins to boogie.
Out in the middle of the ocean, floating on luggage, the movie's hero
is getting down and dirty to the music in the 1990 film. Disney wouldn't
try it with cartoons. But, for a moment, you believe it. And that is the
magic of Tom Hanks.
There's no actor to mind who could pull off that one. Or being in love
with a mermaid (Splash, 1984) or being a 13-year-old boy in a
35-year-old man's body (Big, 1988). His vulnerability works wonders.
It brought him his second Oscar yesterday, for Forrest Gump, the
unlikely tale of an idiot savant with an IQ of 75 who, by accident and
happenstance, leads a charmed life.
Computer graphics allow us to see Gump dance with Elvis, appear on a
talk show with John Lennon, and meet three former American Presidents
during director Robert Zemeckis's (another Oscar winner yesterday)
compact capsule of 40 years of American history.
America loved it. Here, and in the rest of Europe, there was a feeling
of pass-the-sugar-bowl. Hanks also won Best Actor last year for his
often-moving turn as a lawyer dying of AIDS, in Philadelphia. That film
also had a television movie disease-of-the-week feel about it, central
casting victims and villains and happy families, with none of the
rancour that that devastating disease plays on people.
But Hanks triumphed, and it's because he believes it. Of Gump he says:
''It's incredibly sentimental -- but it's not cheap sentiment.
''I'm perplexed by the success. It's a good movie. It's a very
effective movie. But this bizarre kind of success doesn't make any
sense. When it first came out we were all hoping -- from a really crass,
box-office point of view -- that it would clear $100m (#62m). It passed
$250m (#155m) in the first 10 weeks -- making it Paramount Pictures'
most successful film.''
He is picture passport perfect. At 6ft with dark hair and no
distinguishing marks, he calls himself ''a neutral point of view'' for
any project. A flat line? A blancmange commodity? Well, this pudding
person's agents were asking #10m a film before yesterday's latest Oscar
win.
Hanks insists: ''I'm not a chameleon. I don't disappear. I don't know
if it's governed by my body more than anything else. I don't know if
it's my butt or my nose. I don't think I'm ugly, but I don't have those
chiselled good looks.
''That makes me something of a blank canvas for whatever the texture
of the movie. I'm lucky. I've been labelled this Everyman. So, I guess I
am appropriate for everything.
''No one fears me when my face appears on camera. I don't carry any
sort of agenda with me. I used to be a wiseass, but I'm not so much of a
wiseass any more. Because of all that, I think the audience may be
willing to go down whatever road my movies take.
''I don't threaten any man's sense of virility or any woman's sense of
security or decorum. We're always toying with being caught in the big
lie. Some moviegoers may say, 'These people are faking it'. Well,
exactly. We're paid to pretend. It's very scary, but great fun.''
Growing up wasn't. He was born on July 9, 1956, and his parents
divorced five years later. He and his brother and sister lived with
their father Amos, an itinerant cook. His younger sister, then
six-months-old, stayed with his mother. His father remarried twice, his
mother three times. At one time he had 11 assorted siblings.
''There were always about 50 people in the house. I didn't exactly
feel like an outsider, but I was sort of one. We were total strangers,
all thrust together. I remember in school we had to draw a picture of
our house and family and I ran out of places to put people. I put them
on the roof. I had three mothers, five grammar schools, and 10 houses by
the time I was 10.''
He suffered his own marital problems. He was 20 when he married
actress/producer Samantha Lewes (''I think there should be a law against
anyone under 35 getting married'') but it failed, leaving son Colin and
daughter Elizabeth coping with a family separation.
''We tried to make it work, but it was a college affair -- we were
way, way too young.''
A year after the 1987 divorce he married again. He met dark-haired and
dynamic actress Rita Wilson on his 1985 film Volunteers. By the time she
appeared with him and Meg Ryan in Sleepless in Seattle they had a son
Chester, and what he calls a quiet family life in a Spanish-style house
just a 45-minute drive towards the Pacific Ocean from Hollywood. He uses
a Dodge van to commute. Around Los Angeles, on the car pool circuit,
that's a Mommy Van.
He says his biggest regret is that his two older children -- they live
in San Francisco with their mother -- are far away. ''But I still have a
lot of contact with them, certainly much more than I had with my parents
when I was little.''
He has resolved all conflicts with his parents. For years he could not
understand why they broke up the family, but now he says: ''They had to
do what they had to do.''
As had astronaut Jim Lovell. Two days into the Apollo 13 mission in
April 1970 -- which was to have been the third moon-walking voyage --
one of two oxygen tanks blew and the main rocket engine was destroyed.
The explosion caused a complete loss of oxygen and electrical power,
forcing the three astronauts to evacuate the command module and use the
lunar module, which had a separate engine, as a Star Trek-style
lifeboat.
The lunar module, which was designed for two people, had enough oxygen
for 45 hours. It had to be stretched to 90 hours before the module could
be ferried back to Earth.
For four days the world watched as Mission Control in Houston, Texas,
struggled to get men and craft back alive. The astronauts did not know
if they would suffocate from their own carbon dioxide, freeze, or burn
up on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
In director Ron Howard's 1995 film Apollo 13, the year's Best Actor
Oscar winner puts on a NASA spacesuit as Jim Lovell. It is a #32m
investment for Universal Studios, but it is gambling that the
combination of drama, space, and Hanks -- in space where the real stars
are -- will have lift-off.
Hanks has been a space exploration freak since Stanley Kubrick's 2001
(not so far away now), which he has seen countless times.
Lovell returned safely to his family.
Hanks says Rita Wilson saved him from a life lost in emotional space,
a life of loneliness. Of Forrest Gump he comments that it is a movie
without a message. Except, maybe: ''That it is better to be with a
family than alone.''
Hollywood saccharin perhaps, but Tom Hanks is allowed because
yesterday he established once again that nice guys can finish first.

COTONOU: The people of Benin, keen to vote in their second democratic
general election since the end of one-party rule, turned out in force
but lack of voting slips delayed polling in some areas. State radio said
police had detained about 80 people in the political capital Porto-Novo,
who were suspected of being members of an organised electoral fraud
network. The election will decide whether President Nicephore Soglo can
win back control of the rebellious national assembly, a year before
presidential polls. Benin, the ancestral home of voodoo, was one of the
first African countries to kick out the one-party state after the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989.

MOSCOW: Six rockets have been accidentally fired from a Russian Su-25
warplane as it was being prepared for a mission in the second such
incident this month. The missiles were released as the fighter stood at
Krasnodar air base in southern Russia. Four of the rockets exploded at
the base and two others slammed into a settlement of dachas some
distance away. There were no casualties.

Paris, Tuesday
A MILLION wine bottles will be used to help the fight against
near-record unemployment in France by carrying details of young jobless
direct to drinkers, wine growers said today.
Each of the bottles, with Fronton wine from the Tarn and Garonne
region of south-western France, will have a sticker with details of one
of 1000 unemployed people under 25, their work experience, the job they
want, and a telephone number.
''The table is a place for conviviality, but it's also a place where
business is discussed. Through our bottles, we hope to reach potential
employers directly,'' said a spokesman for the producers.
The bottle campaign, which brings a new twist to international debate
about the legitimacy of advertising alcohol, will start across France on
April 3.--Reuter

Rome, Tuesday
TWO former ministers, tax police officials, a city mayor, a retired
magistrate and Mafia suspects were among 35 people arrested today in an
anti-corruption inquiry in southern Italy, police said.
Vito Lattanzio and Rino Formica, both former cabinet ministers, were
arrested on suspicion of corruption as part of a probe into the funding
of health care in the southern Puglia region, police told a news
conference in the city of Bari.
Formica served as finance minister in 1981 and 1982 and was
subsequently also minister of foreign trade and then employment.
Lattanzio held several portfolios, including defence, in the late 1970s
and again in the late 1980s.
Formica, a Socialist, and Lattanzio, a former Christian Democrat, are
both natives of Bari, capital of the southern region. They were served
warrants at their homes in Rome and granted house arrest.
They were charged with corruption and illegal financing of political
parties -- offences at the heart of the three-year-old Tangentopoli
(Bribesville) political corruption scandal that toppled Italy's old
guard.
A statement by magistrates said they had uncovered ''a criminal system
of alliances, protection, complicity and corruption by people willing to
put their personal finances ahead of the common good''.
The two-year investigation revolved around Francesco Cavallari, head
of a chain of private clinics and health care services in the Puglia
region.
Cavallari, who is being investigated over suspected links with the
local Mafia, co-operated with investigators and his testimony led to
today's arrests.
Magistrates and anti-Mafia officials said those arrested were part of
a scheme by which Cavallari's 10 clinics flourished thanks to state
subsidies.
In exchange, parties were promised electoral support and financial
contributions.--Reuter

Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Tuesday
SIERRA Leonean rebels say they will meet representatives of an
international aid organisation on Wednesday to discuss the imminent
handover of 10 Western captives.
One of the prisoners is Calum Murray, 24, from Gress on Lewis, who
together with a fellow worker, Robert D'Cruz, 30, from London, was taken
prisoner in November after the rebels attacked the town of Kabala.
''The 10 of them will all soon join their families,'' Alimamy Sankoh,
the political and foreign affairs co-ordinator of the Revolutionary
United Front told Reuters in Ivory Coast.
Mr Murray was educated at the Nicolson Institute at Stornoway and
graduated in civil engineering from Strathclyde University in 1990. He
had been in Sierra Leone for only nine weeks when he was kidnapped from
a road building project.
The RUF's public relations officer, Ibrahim Jalloh, said two members
of the RUF War Council would meet the aid organisation representatives
on Wednesday to discuss how the six Britons, three Swiss, and a German
could be handed over safely.
''It is only to clear the way for them to come out,'' he said.
''Before we move we have to make sure that it's safe.''
The rebels attacked a village 38 miles from the capital, Freetown, on
Sunday, sending a flood of frightened refugees into the city.
Jalloh said the rebels wanted to avoid an attack on Freetown because
of the civilian casualties it would cause. They were keen to talk to the
Government but were sticking to their demand that foreign troops must
leave the country first.
''If we can have a dialogue, the march into Freetown need not take
place,'' he said. ''If you launch an attack, many people will die, and
we are trying to avoid that.''
Foday Sankoh's RUF rebels launched their campaign in March 1991 but
have stepped up attacks since last year. Jalloh said they controlled
main roads in the interior, where they carry out frequent ambushes, but
stayed in the bush rather than hold towns to reduce civilian casualties
in case of attack.
They handed over a Russian and a Sierra Leonean to the International
Committee of the Red Cross on January 24, and released six Italian nuns
and a Brazilian nun to church authorities a week ago.--Reuter.

Moscow, Tuesday
PRINCIPAL ballerina Nadezhda Pavlova has quit the Bolshoi ballet a day
after the theatre's chief conductor resigned.
Pavlova, who joined the Bolshoi in 1975, had danced leading roles on
the stage of the renowned theatre in ballets such as Romeo and Juliet
and Giselle. She is shown, left, as Quitri in Don Quixote.
Alexander Lazarev, chief conductor and head of the opera company for
seven years, and Valery Levantal, chief designer, both resigned this
week.
High-profile resignations began earlier this month when former
artistic director Yuri Grigorovich stood down after 30 years.
Grigorovich and supporters accused artistic director Vladimir Kokonin of
incompetence and were upset at introduction of short-term contracts to
replace jobs-for-life. It led to a strike by Bolshoi dancers, the first
in its 219-year history.

REMEMBER when President Ronald Reagan claimed that trees cause air
pollution? University of Florida researchers now say he was right, at
least in part. A study of terpenes, a component of the gooey resin in
pine tree sap, found that they actually do contribute to pollution,
according to Eric Allen, a professor of environmental sciences. Although
Reagan's remarks drew hoots of scorn, the researchers said pine trees
aggravate the global problem by emitting eight different types of
terpenes. Terpenes react with other pollutants and sunlight to produce
ozone.

Berlin, Tuesday
THE United Nations opened an 11-day conference today aimed at averting
global warming and climate change, and immediately notched a small
success in persuading oil producers not to block proceedings.
The Berlin conference, with more than 1000 delegates from at least 130
countries so far, is a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro. Its goal is to establish a basis for cutting man-made air
pollution into the next century.
''The peoples of the world expect us to take the decisions necessary
to protect them from the harm that threatens,'' German Enviroment
Minister Angela Merkel, elected conference president, told the opening
session. ''We carry responsibility not only for today's generation but
also for those of the future.''
Among the opponents of drastic cuts in emissions are oil producers.
Burned fossil fuels account for much of the man-made carbon dioxide
responsible for steadily warming the atmosphere.
These countries, spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, had threatened to
deadlock the entire conference by insisting that voting should be by
consensus only, giving them an effective veto.
The Saudi delegation later agreed in private talks with Merkel,
however, to set the matter aside for now and let the conference proceed.
The real debate in Berlin is to centre on two issues.
One is whether countries will commit themselves to further emission
targets beyond the year 2000. In Rio, industrialised countries promised
to cut emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000, but are
falling short of that.
Merkel short-circuited procedures to get swift agreement on some
peripheral issues.
''I got the impression in talks with different delegations that they
really are ready to make compromises,'' she said.
She would try to broker a solution on the crucial voting issue by the
weekend, but saw little prospect of the oil producers winning a board
seat in exchange for majority voting.
Merkel was blunt about the consequences the world could face if it
lets global warming go on unchecked.
''If we don't take action, we must expect grave and irreversible
consequences; a rise in sea levels, a shift in climate and vegetation
zones and a deterioration in food production and the world nutrition
situation are only a few examples,'' she said.
''If we wait until observable climate changes have begun, we will be
stuck with them for decades. If we are serious about long-term change we
will not be able to avoid radical changes in our pattern of consumption
and production and in our lifestyle.''
One of the conference's toughest tasks will be to share out this
burden fairly between developing countries and the rich industrialised
nations, who are already behind schedule on pledges to cut emissions by
the year 2000.
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali pointed out the
conference's development role, saying it was ''a crucial lever for
shaping production and consumptin patterns to promote rather than hinder
sustainable development''.--Reuter

From PATRICK BROGAN
Washington, Tuesday
THE United States announced this morning that it would begin
consulting its allies on tightening sanctions on Libya. The Americans
are proposing a Security Council resolution banning the import of oil
from Libya until it hands over the two men suspected of planting the
bomb on PanAm 103.
The main effect so far has been a Libyan threat to defy existing
sanctions and withdraw from the United Nations.
First international reactions to the suggested oil embargo have not
been favourable. A number of European countries, starting with Italy,
France, and Spain, import large quantities of Libyan oil and have
opposed an oil embargo in the past.
The Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, said this morning that the
US had begun consultation with members of the Security Council on
tightening sanctions against Libya. Sanctions were first imposed in
1992, when Libya refused to extradite the two intelligence officers.
Sanctions were further tightened in 1993, and are up for renewal in
April. The White House spokesman said ''this is a renewed effort,
working with others of the Security Council, to attempt to toughen the
existing sanctions regime.'' He added: ''We are under no illusion that
this is going to be an easy effort.''
The initial sanctions voted three years ago included bans on exporting
arms to Libya, and restricted Libyan diplomatic missions abroad and air
travel. In 1993, there were further restrictions on financial exchanges,
Libyan assets abroad were frozen and it was forbidden to import some
oil-production equipment.
However, its oil exports were not effected. Libya sells about $10
billion worth of oil a year.
Eight representatives of families of the people killed over Lockerbie
visited the White House on Monday and met the president's national
security adviser, Anthony Lake. He assured them that the Clinton
administration would actively pursue the two suspects.
Last week, the FBI put the two wanted men on its ''Ten Most Wanted
List'' and posted a $4m reward for their capture.
World oil markets were unruffled, analysts doubting if Washington
would get the backing it needed, especially from European nations with
close ties to the Libyan oil sector.
The US proposal stoked new defiance in Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, who
declared that Libya would ignore the UN air embargo and send airplanes
carrying Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia.
The official Libyan news agency, Jana, also quoted him as saying Libya
was considering quitting the United Nations because of its sanctions.
''If the Libyan planes are downed, the pilgrims killed, and the planes
burned or banned, then it will mean that the Kaaba (prophet's tomb in
Mecca) is under the United States domination and that Saudi Arabia in
that case is not independent,'' Gaddafi said.
The pilgrimage season is in May and pilgrims may start arriving in
Saudi Arabia in April. In the past Libyan pilgrims have flown there
after travelling overland out of Libya.--Reuter

Anvar Khan reports on an 'outpost for children' where a caring
attitude
offers stability and contentment and parents share the benefits of
family life
with a succession of youngsters to whom it has been denied
QUARRIER'S Village in Bridge of Weir appears undisturbed by the modern
world. The tranquil streets are called Faith, Hope and Love. The gardens
yawn languorously towards clusters of bumbling bushes. The monkey puzzle
trees, the oaks and firs have been left alone to mature in their own
time.
Rich people can afford to buy their way out of inner-city sprawls,
poor people live on top of one another. When Quarrier's Village was
built in the late nineteenth century, paupers were 10 to a half a
tarpaulin. What is most striking, then, about the village's gothic,
turreted snugs, is that they are unusually close, for buildings and
citizens who are supposed to enjoy the freedom of autonomy of pocket.
I arrive at Ken and Anne Whitty's Dickensian palace on Peace Avenue in
the morning. The sun reflects from moguls of snow on to clear windows
where pretty curtains are belted at the middle, like buxom Quaker wives
whispering in gossip. The snowmen are Bertie Basset creatures, solid and
well-rounded, with jaunty, crazy smiles.
Quarrier's Village is an outpost for children in care. And while the
area, with its church called Mount Zion, its office, library, and acres
of green, green grass, is pure Disney, there's BBC2 documentary material
inside.
In a letter to The Herald, published on November 30, 1864, William
Quarrier, a shoe-maker, and the first man in Glasgow to have a multiple
of shops, called for gentlemen of a similar charitable mind to organise
a society where shoe-shine boys could be fed and clothed and educated.
Soon, he'd accrued 1400 starving weans and moved them out to a village
in the countryside he'd built with the help of public donations.
It was William's experience as a child, learning a trade at the age of
seven to support his mother after his father's death, which aligned him
with the poor. He wrote in 1872:
''When a little boy, I stood in the High Street of Glasgow,
barefooted, bareheaded, cold and hungry, having tasted no food for a day
and a half, and, as I gazed at each passer-by, wondering why they did
not help such as I, a thought passed through my mind that I would not do
as they when I would get the means to help others.''
Anne Whitty, 47, is a Community Parent who looks after kids from nine
to 20 years of age. She too, decided as an adult that she would like to
look after children who would otherwise be abandoned to a system where a
roof is guaranteed but emotional support is not. Anne knows it reassures
children in residential care to see the same face every day, rather than
the one who happens to be on shift.
She explains: ''I was brought up in Quarrier's Village as a child,
from the age of 11 months until I was 17. I had no contact with my
parents. But I had a very special house-parent and was lucky that I had
the same house-mother all the years I was here. Others weren't so
fortunate.''
Anne met her husband Ken, 50, through a Baptist Church in Glasgow.
They were married within three years. In 1974, Anne applied for a job in
Quarrier's Village as a house-parent. In 1975, Ken, then an engineer at
Rolls-Royce, took voluntary redundancy and eventually become a
housefather. Thirteen years and 14 kids later (foster, not their own)
the Whittys were both made redundant by the regional council.
Ken recalls: ''Having worked for 13 years looking after more than 100
of Strathclyde's children, we then had to be assessed to see if we were
suitable for looking after Strathclyde's children. The assessment took
nine months, the longest job interview I've ever had.''
The Whittys, unlike other community parents in the area, wanted to
become self-employed and foster on their own. They saved hard and bought
the house in Quarrier's Village in which they'd previously worked, a
huge vessel where each bedroom is kitted out according to the
personality in residence, from grungey to gleaming, from Barbie to Paul
McStay.
There's a cat and a goldfish too, who, regardless of their primeval
wariness of each other, manage to live and let live, a bit like the six
foster kids and the three of Whittys' own. ''Has living with strange and
strangers' children coloured your view of family life?'' I ask Craig,
21, who wants to be an RE teacher.
''The ideal family is something I aspire to,'' he smiles. Craig thinks
his parents are ''nutters''. He's lived with damaged kids since he was
11 months old. ''I've learnt not to be judgmental about people, because
you don't know what someone's been through.''
When Ken and Anne accept a child, they have to live with the fall-out
of another family. Most kids have been sexually abused by siblings or
parents of both sexes. The Whittys can't hope to change a kid's biology,
psychology, history or habits. They can only provide the continuing
example of a normal family. In this way, at least, the child has a
comparison with his or her own past. ''We're really trying to make up
for the bad times they've had before,'' says Anne.
Community parents are, given the lengthy period of time in which they
oversee a child's life (until he or she is 18), remarkably restricted in
the discipline they can exercise over wild, wild kids. There can be no
corporal punishment of any kind. Ken and Anne have to be perfect
parents, but real mothers and fathers do not. ''You have a child for
eight years,'' says Anne, ''then they walk out the door and you have
nothing in return.''
The powers of the local authority are all too pervasive. Each child in
Ken and Anne's care has their own personal social worker to which they
report. Children who've been in care know how to work the system. There
is always the risk that one might maintain out of badness that Ken or
Anne has broken a rule.
''Once there's any hint of malpractice, the system swings into action
very quickly, and suddenly we're on the receiving end of investigations
which can be quite horrific,'' sighs Ken. ''You're walking on eggshells
the whole time.''
Private residents and local schools are supportive of the deprived
children who are shipped in from various regions. Quarrier's is still a
village which cares. But the Christian faith is, Ken and Anne explain,
the ''basis of all we do. Without that we'd have cracked up years ago''.
''We're not a children's home, we're a home for children,'' Anne adds.
Like William Quarrier, her own childhood memories are a yardstick for
the proper treatment of kids in care. ''It was never the children's
fault, it was their parents or their circumstances. I always thought
they deserved a chance.''

Bujumbura, Tueday
A JUMBO jet which flew into Burundi today carrying a French minister
on an urgent peace mission left later in the day carrying some 200
Europeans.
There were few public tears or emotional scenes in the capital
Bujumbura's airport as wives and children said farewell to relatives and
boarded an Air France Boeing 747 sent by the French government, leaving
a city racked by ethnic violence.
Officials said President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya tried to persuade
his cabinet to support foreign military intervention, a position opposed
by Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo and ruled out by French Co-operation
and Development Minister Bernard Debre.
''Everyone's speaking of military intervention. I fail to understand
who, against whom and with who?'' Debre told reporters after flying into
the country for the second time in a week.
He said the international community had learned the problems with
intervention in Somalia and Rwanda and that Burundi had to find its own
solution.
''France will not intervene militarily,'' Debre said.
Violence between a Hutu majority and Tutsi minority has killed
hundreds in the last week, got the government talking of creating
separate ethnic ghettos and threatens to rip the country apart, as it
did neighbouring Rwanda last year.
French embassy officials refused to describe the flight as an
evacuation, saying that 160 French citizens left at French expense for
early Easter holidays because of security worries. Some 40 other
Europeans also used the flight to escape the capital -- now calm after a
weekend of ethnic cleansing by Hutu militias.-- Reuter

CHARITIES and voluntary organisations will be among the worst victims
of local government reform -- facing job losses and, in some cases,
possible closure.
It is a sector that many people have made light of in the past,
thinking only of Girl Guide meetings and old ladies with collecting cans
on flag days. But its involvement in Scottish society has quickly grown
to take up much of the work which people often believe should be done by
Government agencies.
The figures may appear astonishing to some, but voluntary
organisations account for 20,000 full-time jobs, and an annual turnover
of #1500m in Scotland.
Yet, the local government changeover will lead to some smaller
charities and voluntary organisations closing down, and people losing
their jobs.
This is the prediction of Mr Martin Sime, director of the Scottish
Council for Voluntary Organisations. He wants the Scottish Office to set
up an emergency fund to help organisations -- involved in areas such as
pre-school work, youth groups, pensioners' organisations, and community
development -- over the difficulties of the next two years.
The sums of money involved are large. Nearly #90m a year is paid by
Scottish councils to voluntary organisations providing vital services.
But only #8m of that comes from district councils, the bulk from
regional councils.
This is where the difficulty lies. It is expected that most of the new
councils will be dominated by district councillors. They will not have
the knowledge or expertise to appreciate fully the work done by the
voluntary sector.
When budgets are being worked out, the fear is that the voluntary
sector will not be able to achieve the same level of funding from the
new councils. What will make it worse, is that small charities do not
hold cash in reserve to tide them over. Some will simply go to the wall.
Then there is the difficulty of diversification of councils. In the
West of Scotland, voluntary organisations which dealt only with
Strathclyde region will now find themselves talking to 12 separate
councils. Can they assume that the 12 will fund them to the same extent?
If, for example, an organisation provides pre-school care in areas of
urban deprivation. It allows single parents to take jobs to support
their families. The care, however, is not spread evenly among the 12
councils, but is concentrated in the more built up areas, such as in
housing schemes.
It may be that some of the new councils will claim it has nothing to
do with them and not help the funding. The result will be that some
nurseries will have to close because they do not have the funds to pay
for a full-time attendant.
Parents who cannot afford an alternative will be forced to give up
their jobs and rely on social security -- costing the country more than
the small grant which would have kept the organisation going.
A worse scenario may be that charities will target their services, not
at the areas where they are needed most, but at the councils which are
more likely to provide funding.
Meanwhile, the councils struggle with the cost of reorganisation at a
time when the Government is restricting funding. Do they cut staff?
Well, every council job that goes will probably mean a fight with the
unions. Better to look for a softer option.
Suddenly, that #90m for the voluntary sector begins to look very
vulnerable indeed, particularly as much of the money goes in areas where
the councils do not have a statutory obligation to provide the service.
Mr Sime points out: ''Perhaps the bigger organisations will be easier
to protect. The small ones, however, will be more easily exposed. If the
new councils find they are delaying decisions because they are
concentrating on getting their own structures right, are they really
going to get around to deciding on the #500 donation which is so vital
for a local pre-school playgroup?''
But if the money is not forthcoming, the volunteers may become
disillusioned. They may simply give up providing the service. When the
new councils finally get around to helping them, they are no longer
there.
There are other fears, according to Mr Sime, who believes it will be
virtually impossible to get funding for new projects, with greater
efforts having to be put into funding existing schemes.
Ms Linda Martin, a full-time organiser with the Strathclyde Elderly
Forum, said the future was unclear. The forum, which provides support
for 70 local groups in the region, is funded through an urban programme
operated by Strathclyde region. The #72,000 ensures the jobs of four
staff.
So far, funding is only secure until the end of the year, with talks
continuing until next April, but after that it is up to the new
councils.
The forum, which gives the region's 400,000 elderly a voice and
reflects their needs, will then have to negotiate with the 12 new
councils.
Ms Martin admits it will be far more difficult than simply dealing
with one council and, with a limited staff, it could use up time which
could be spent on other projects.
With the imminent changes in local government, it is vital that
organisations like the elderly forum ensure the people they represent
have their views heard. Yet, instead of fighting for the old, they are
having to fight for their own existence.

Labour's national membership scheme has led to widespread discontent
within the party. JOHN MacCALMAN, Municipal Correspondent, examines the
cause of the bitter infighting
EARLIER this year a councillor was invited to leave the Scottish
Labour Party headquarters in Glasgow after a row with officials.
The argument was not about policy matters. It was a much more
important issue -- whether the councillor was eligible to participate in
the selection of candidates for the single-tier elections in Glasgow.
Confronting party officials at headquarters may have been an extreme
option, but the councillor's complaint about not having been
acknowledged as a fully paid-up member has been a familiar theme among
party members throughout the city since the end of last year.
A desperate scramble for Labour nominations at the Glasgow elections,
a communications breakdown over a ''freeze date'' on membership which
prevented many members from taking part in the selection of candidates,
and factional warfare at the City Chambers have traumatised the party in
recent weeks.
In addition, widespread discontent with the party's allegedly chaotic
national membership scheme has led some to call for a locally-based
scheme controlled from Scottish Labour Party headquarters in Glasgow.
Such a volatile combination of circumstances has set friend against
friend, colleague against colleague, and given internal party enemies a
suitable pretext for settling old scores.
Lawyers' letters have proliferated, interdicts have been threatened,
and selection conferences re-run following questions about the
eligibility of individuals to participate in selection meetings.
One councillor, Mrs Margaret Sinclair, was promised a re-run at
Crookston by the Scottish Labour Party, but was then denied by Labour
Party headquarters in London.
Walworth Road officials made their decision on the grounds that the
party's rules on the matter were ''sufficiently ambiguous'' to suggest
that a case could be brought against the decision for a re-run of the
selection meeting.
The most significant factor in what has perhaps been the most bitter
and messy selection exercise in history of the Labour Party in Glasgow
was the imposition of a freeze date of December 21 on party membership.
That was when the party's Temporary Local Government Committee finalised
its panel of candidates for the elections.
Having a cut-off point following selection of a panel is not new. What
was new on this occasion was that the procedures precluded the settling
of arrears, thereby disqualifying a significant number of people from
voting for candidates at selection meetings.
It is understood the rationale was to address some of the problems
that have arisen in the past where candidate selection was effectively
determined by minibus loads of ''paper members'' being delivered to a
selection meeting and a bag of money placed on the table.
These ''paper members'' would thereafter disappear into the night
having effectively selected a councillor for the next four years.
It is widely accepted the new procedure was an honest attempt by party
officials to ensure fair play and to make sure the selections were
actually genuine. In principle it is a fair procedure, but its
consequence was panic.
Members caught by the new procedure thrashed around looking for
scapegoats, like their branch secretaries. Others claimed to have paid
but the money had not been acknowledged by the computer at Walworth
Road. The result was that their names did not appear on the vital party
membership print-out which appears every six weeks or so.
Had the branch secretary sent the money in time? Had Walworth Road's
notoriously slow administration messed up again?
For one constituency party secretary, the national membership system
is a nightmare. He said: ''I've had members of 30 years standing, who
pay by standing order, and they've been waiting on their membership
cards for two years.
''The freeze date of December 21 has caused havoc. It's most
disheartening when you've got members of 20 and 30 years standing, who
have faithfully paid their dues to the branch and then suddenly they're
deprived of their only chance of making an effective contribution --
voting for a candidate of their choice.''
A disenchanted branch secretary spoke of ''immense difficulties''
created by the national membership scheme. Among his grievances were:
* People disappearing off the computerised membership list and thereby
being disenfranchised at selection meetings.
* Mail lying in Walworth Road for weeks without being processed.
He disclosed: ''I've got personal experience of sending a cheque down
there and it not being cashed for six weeks. It sometimes takes people
four months to get a membership card through.
''What happens is, their money is collected locally, sent nationally,
then it can take staff at Walworth Road weeks to process it. As a result
of this kind of delay some people can appear to go into arrears when
they have actually paid their dues.''
He did not believe there would be any improvement until some form of
local control was devolved to Scotland. He said the situation had
deteriorated since the inception of the national membership scheme four
years ago.
In his view, many people had been disenfranchised unjustly.
''If someone pays their money to me as membership secretary and I
delay sending that money away, that's the party's responsibility, it's
not the member's responsibility. The party should sort that out,'' he
argued.
He alleged there were members of the Temporary Local Government
Committee executive in Glasgow who were adjudicating in selection
conferences and checking other people's credentials who were themselves
''out of compliance''.
''The irony is that some of the councillors who have been knocked out
were knocked out because they didn't have the full year's membership, or
were in arrears,'' he asserted.
Then there was the case of the Glasgow councillor and branch chairman
who actually called in personally at Walworth Road to sort out some
membership problems while he was attending a conference in London.
''They wouldn't even speak to him,'' a colleague said.
''He was not challenging in a personal capacity, having already been
selected himself. He was the branch chairman and was trying to organise
other selection meetings.
''He was there to challenge why members had not been processed
timeously in other seats, and he was amazed when they refused point
blank to speak to him.''
It also appears that paying by the much-vaunted direct debit method is
no guarantee that membership will be acknowledged by the Walworth Road
computer.
The wife of a Glasgow party official contacted Walworth Road after
getting no response to a direct debit mandate dispatched at least three
months previously.
She was told by a member of staff at Walworth Road: ''There's quite a
lot of mail lying here unprocessed.''
A senior party official, while reluctant to discuss internal
administrative and organisational matters, said: ''This has been the
worst period of my life. I hope I never have to go through anything like
this again.''

THE M40 crash in which a teacher and 12 children died when their
minibus hit a stationary lorry was a tragedy just waiting to happen
again, it was claimed yesterday.
Mr Bob Smalley, speaking at the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Accidents' 60th congress, meeting in Glasgow, also warned parents to
stop their children travelling in minibuses ''unless satisfied the
drivers are properly trained and qualified''.
He suggested that the fitting of seat belts had become the ''quick fix
solution'' since the M40 deaths in November, 1993, and argued that the
money spent on restraints would have been better used on driver
training.
Mr Smalley, chief examiner of Rospa's driver services and a former
traffic chief with West Midlands Police, argued that many of the belts
are not only unsafe but useless since they break away on impact, because
they cannot be properly secured in old minibuses.
He said: ''Having no real lead on training, it was inevitable that
what has taken place over the last 12 months is a mish-mash of good,
bad, and indifferent policies.''
Later, he told The Herald: ''There is always a chance that something
like that fateful night on the M40 will happen again. Drivers are still
not being properly trained for minibuses, and there are no controls over
the hours they work.''
He stressed that cost is compromising the single most beneficial
safety element -- on the road training by properly qualified
instructors.
The congress also highlighted the lack of time available for teachers
to examine charter buses and report faults, and the reactive nature of
vehicle maintenance on the part of the bus operators which precluded
preventative safety measures being taken.

As parties battle for control of Edinburgh FRANCES HORSBURGH, Local
Government Correspondent, assesses their chances
CONTROL of the capital is a special prize for any political party.
Labour seized hold of Edinburgh District Council in 1984 and has held on
ever since.
In 1976 it won back control of Lothian region from a Conservative
administration which had been helped to stay in power by the Liberal
Democrats.
But when the Government dreamed up the idea of a council
reorganisation it seemed perfectly possible that the Conservatives could
win back power in a reconstructed Edinburgh.
The city has always been more fertile ground for the Tories and they
managed to win 23 seats to Labour's 30 in the 1992 district elections
and beat them in the share of the popular vote.
So it is a measure of the Government's current enormous unpopularity,
as well as the generally dire plight of the Tory party in Scotland, that
Labour is the overwhelming favourite to win control of the single-tier
council and the Liberal Democrats are now claiming they could overtake
the Tories and become the second largest party.
In fact all the Tories' opponents are agreed that it is going to be a
bad night for them on April 6. The question being posed is -- just how
bad?
That will very much depend on to what extent the voters in Edinburgh,
as elsewhere, treat the local polls as a national referendum on the
performance of an exceptionally unpopular Government.
It will depend too on whether the Tories' cost-cutting pitch -- a
possible reduction of #120 in this year's Labour set council tax --
still has appeal.
In an attempt to counter it -- at both region and district level --
Labour managed to freeze the council tax for next year.
As polling day draws closer, local Labour leaders have been accused of
arrogance by the Tories and of deciding already which of their number
will occupy which municipal office after the elections.
Labour strenuously denies the charge. While confident of victory, it
claims not to be complacent and emphasises it is fighting not just the
Tories but the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party in
four-way contests in every city seat.
When you are dealing with a new single-tier council which has 58 seats
instead of 62, and new ward boundaries, previous statistics have to be
used with extreme caution.
In the regional elections last year Labour won 20 of 29 seats in
Edinburgh with just 35% of the vote. The corollary is that if that scale
of support went down a few notches the seat tally would fall
dramatically.
The magic number to win is 30, and it is quite possible Labour could
snatch up to 36.
To achieve that, it needs to vanquish the Tories in pivotal wards like
Alnwickhill, Duddingston and Stockbridge and beat the Scottish National
Party in Dalmeny/Kirkliston.
Labour's applecart could be upset if it loses any central city seats
to the SNP, which is desperate to make a breakthrough in places like
Granton and Pilton.
Labour's worst nightmare would be having to rely on either the SNP --
as has been the case in the district for the past three years -- or the
Scottish Liberal Democrats to get a majority.
Liberal Democrats in the city have their own agenda which involves
increasing their presence in West Edinburgh by winning the retiring SNP
lord provost's seat in Corstorphine and making further inroads into
targeted Tory territory in southern areas of the city like Merchiston
and South Morningside.
They hold seven seats in the district and four in the region and hope
to go ''well into double figures'' as a group in the new city council.
Such a total could put them ahead of the Tories as the official
Opposition party.
For the Tories, it is all about digging in and trying not to be swept
away by an anti-Government mood. The more experienced are campaigning
very much as canny, right of centre, local politicians promising cheaper
and more efficiently-run local services rather than as foot soldiers for
John Major.
The SNP, for its part, must try to make an impact by winning seats
from Labour in a city which has never been very receptive to its
message. It has achieved some publicity by holding the balance of power
on the district council and supplying a kilted lord provost, but is far
stronger in nearby West Lothian which now becomes a single-tier council.
So what of the issues and the policies?
Labour is the local government establishment in the city and its
controversial transport policy, which involves traffic calming measures
with streets blocked off and pavements widened, is hotly debated.
The Tories have claimed Labour is waging a vendetta against the motor
car to the detriment of city trade, and both the Liberal Democrats and
the SNP have attacked the way the policy has been implemented in
specific areas.
Labour, for its own part, has promised to continue to promote high
quality public transport services and has made key commitments in its
local manifesto on providing a nursery place for every three-year-old
and maintaining a concessionary travel scheme for the elderly and
disabled.
It is standing on its record over developing the city as a major
European capital, and cites the opening of the restored Festival
Theatre, the highly successful Gyle Shopping Centre, and the almost
completed conference centre.
As well as highlighting the fact that Edinburgh's citizens pay the
highest council tax in Scotland, the Tories have promised more bobbies
on the beat with a controversial plan for a ''retained'' police force in
addition to existing officers.
The Liberal Democrats claim they are the champions of real local
democracy, and are emphasising the benefits of decentralisation. They
have proposed nine area committees which would have their own budgets.
In addition, they would like to see access to education opened up with
the establishment of a new council department of lifelong learning.
The SNP is calling for a ''Fresh Start'' for local politics in
Edinburgh and has promised the first priority for newly-elected
Nationalist councillors will be to press for the formation of a shadow
water committee to monitor the workings of the new East of Scotland
water quango, which is to take over the council-run services.

GLASGOW is putting forward a lengthy list of special projects for
Millennium Fund support. The city's initial submission of 13 proposals
add up to a staggering #213m.
The two projects which top the shopping list are:
* the North Bank Project, priced at #90m, which aims to create ''a new
city quarter'' around the old Trongate, the original heart of the city.
* The Glasgow Green Regeneration, cost #65m, involves a massive plan
to give the huge park a facelift and to erect a purpose-built indoor
arena as an international sport and entertainment centre.
The list of proposals was approved yesterday by the city council's
policy and resources committee.
Afterwards Labour leader Councillor Pat Lally said: ''Something like
#5000m of cash will be available through the Millennium Fund. No-one is
quite certain about the criterion that will be used -- but obviously the
commissioners will have to approve an awful lot of projects in a
relatively short period of time to coincide with the year 2001.''
The deadline is March 31 for outline applications being lodged from
all over Britain. The next step is for the millennium organisers to sift
through the ideas and then select a list of projects which will involve
a subsequent more detailed ''formal application'' to be submitted.
Councillor Lally said that in most cases a project on the Glasgow list
would qualify for European funding.
Among the other projects on the list are riverside renewal, new parks,
and the refurbishment of the Botanic Gardens. Separate proposals are
being drawn up for a host of other projects that could qualify for
sports, arts or heritage funding that are available under the National
Lottery Scheme.

A BIZARRE war of words broke out between Scottish Labour MEPs and the
general secretary of the party in Scotland, Mr Jack McConnell, with an
exchange of angry letters.
Glasgow MEP Bill Miller, frustrated by the failure of efforts to
arrange a meeting between Mr McConnell and the six Scottish Labour MEPs,
wrote to Keir Hardie House accusing Mr McConnell of displaying ''callous
disregard'' for their efforts.
The Scottish general secretary wrote back expressing disappointment at
''your lack of tolerance with regard to the pressures under which this
office was working in the run-up to Scottish conference.''
Mr McConnell said of the ''callous disregard'' accusation: ''I find
this comment offensive but I am certain that future relations between
this office and Scottish Labour MEPs will be positive and
constructive.''
He added that since Mr Miller's ''complete disregard'' for
instructions from London about not committing resources to office and
staffing arrangements, ''I am surprised that you feel free to criticise
anyone else.''
Mr McConnell wrote that to improve relations as quickly as possible he
would contact Strathclyde West MEP Hugh McMahon to find suitable dates
for a meeting.
In Brussels, last night Mr Miller said the problem had now been
resolved. They had been trying to arrange a meeting since last year's
European elections but there had been a series of delays. ''One thing
led to another and that is what led to this open and frank exchange of
views,'' Mr Miller said.
''I tend to be fairly blunt. I don't beat about the bush -- I just run
straight through it -- so I wrote saying 'get the finger out.' If you
start taking offence at things, you shouldn't be in politics.''
He did not believe that long-term damage had been done to relations
between the Brussels group and Keir Hardie House.
Mr McConnell agreed, saying there was an element of
''tongue-in-cheek'' about both letters.
''I was back out campaigning with Bill last week,'' he said. ''We have
an excellent working relationship with Labour MEPs and that relationship
continues.''

OFFICIALS at the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh were in bullish mood
yesterday, predicting a large increase in Nationalist-held seats after
next month's local elections.
The party's chief executive, Mr Michael Russell -- buoyed by the
announcement that Grampian Regional Council, a joint SNP administration,
had won a quality management award from the independent Society of Local
Authority Chief Executives -- said that 10 years ago, it would have been
difficult to talk about SNP-ruled councils, but that had changed.
He rejected the claim that in northern rural areas there would be a
''softie'' SNP vote, and that the position in the central belt could
reflect a different position.
He said: ''We have delivered the goods more than Labour has done, and
our councils will have commitment in a wide range of areas.
''We are bullish, and we are out there knocking on doors.''
Mr Russell pointed out that the party is fighting 86% of seats in
Scotland, has circulated more than one million leaflets, and plans to
deliver another 250,000.
In Perth and Kinross, he said, voters also had the chance to deliver a
''double whammy'' by returning parliamentary candidate, Roseanna
Cunningham, QC, in the forthcoming by-election there.

TWENTY skeletons have been found in unmarked graves in the grounds of
the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh.
Archaeologists are currently working there to check for more bodies.
The remains -- some of children and babies -- will be taken to Glasgow
University's archaeological research division for analysis.
The initial discovery was made by workers digging near the palace
walls. Dr Steve Driscoll, director of Glasgow University's
archaeological research division, said the find could be part of an 18th
century cemetery connected to the ruined Holyrood Abbey.

MR MAJOR has some words of comfort for his harassed party chairman, he
confided to a packed House of Commons yesterday. ''I have told Mr Hanley
to take no notice whatever,'' he said.
Of headlines like ''Bungler Hanley's at it again,'' ''Chairman will
resign if Tories flop,'' ''Hapless Hanley battles to hold on''
presumably -- almost as bad as the ones written about Mr Major, so Mr
Hanley can feel that he is being reassured by someone who has been there
too.
The Prime Minister then snapped at Miss Judith Church (Dagenham --
Lab.) who had enquired if Mr Hanley's position was ''unassailable.'' He
told her: ''I have told him it goes with the job, as does silly
questions like that.''
But, of course, it was Lady Thatcher who, by describing her
Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, as ''unassailable'' shortly before his
endurance snapped and he resigned, who gave the word a political meaning
the reverse of its dictionary one.
Mr Major may consider Mr Hanley's position unassailable, although this
seems unlikely, but if he had said so politicians and media would have
been more than ever convinced that Mr Hanley is on the way out.
As it was, after his account of his pep talk, Opposition wags chortled
''bye bye Jeremy,'' ''cheerio,'' and such like. Mr Hanley's personal
problem can be considered more globally for he is only one of many
Ministers who are less than satisfied with their media coverage.
Interviewers rudely interrupt them; their economic and other triumphs
are reported less fulsomely than in, say, Conservative Newsline, and, as
the media is the medium through which most voters hear of these things
and as ''the medium is the message,'' is widely believed by politicians
to be a true saying, there are quite a lot of unhappy Ministers about.
Mrs Margaret Hodge (Barking-Labour) who, when leader of Islington
council, frequently got the treatment dished out by the capitalist
media, suggested to Mr Major that he and his team should ''stop
whingeing.''
Mr Major wondered on how many occasions Mr Alastair Campbell, late of
the Daily Mirror, now Mr Blair's press guru, bent the Corporation's
corporate ear, implying that he thought it would be quite often. For
himself, he said loftily ''I like to see truthful reporting.''
If the media told the truth, we were to infer, everyone would realise
what a jolly good job HMG was doing, voters would start shouting ''five
more years'' at him in the street instead of other things and headlines
would read ''Broken Blair battles to hold on.'' Maybe.
Battling Blair is developing the bad habit of telegraphing his punches
which, if the nation's judges take on board will deservedly lose him a
few points. Yesterday he crammed together railway privatisation, water
charges and tax increases and swung his right. ''Is it any wonder that
the British people believe and know they are worse off under the
Tories?''
''The soundbite came earlier than usual,'' mused Mr Major.
The Sketch would suggest to its broadcasting colleagues that when a
Leader of the Opposition starts delivering slogans across the despatch
box it is only fair to show the Prime Minister reminding the nation that
that is what it is and not a clip out of a genuine political exchange.
Labour would certainly whinge just as much if it became an unpopular
government having a hard time. When complaining about the sensitivity of
politicians, journalists, especially perhaps on the Beeb with a Charter
to live up to, should occasionally give thanks that British politicians,
however riled they get, have at least never sought to put into practice
one of Senator Everitt Dirksen's three laws of politics -- ''Don't get
mad, get even.''

THE Government may try to prevent the calling of a public inquiry into
withdrawal of the Kyle of Lochalsh ferry to avoid political
embarrassment. In so doing, it could undermine the public's right to
fight for threatened ferry services in the future.
The service, operated by the Government-owned Caledonian MacBrayne, is
due to go when the #23m Skye Bridge opens in August or September.
However, as The Herald revealed last week, that may not leave enough
time to follow consultative procedures and the ferries could still be
running when the bridge opens.
At issue is the sole right of the Railway Users Consultative Committee
for Scotland to call a public inquiry over withdrawal of a service. This
right was exercised by the RUCCS's predecessor, the Scottish Transport
Users Consultative Committee.
The RUCCS, created by the 1993 Railway Act, has never called a ferry
inquiry and the Government recently served notice that it may no longer
have that power.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said yesterday that the official
position had not changed, but added: ''The matter is far from
straightforward and is currently being considered by the RUCCS and the
Department of Transport. We believe the RUCCS still has a general power
to consider any matter affecting ferry services or facilities provided
by Caledonian MacBrayne, which of course would involve the withdrawal of
a service.''
The question remains whether this power extends to calling an inquiry.
The Herald understands there was a Scottish Office view it did, but
''political considerations'' are now held more important.
One source told the Herald last night: ''There would be considerable
embarrassment to the Government. They gave an undertaking to the
developers that the ferry would cease the day the bridge opened and that
they would get all the traffic.
''The finances were calculated on that basis, but it is conceivable
the ferry might carry on running for weeks or even months if the
procedures are followed in full. There is also the embarrassment of the
farce of a public inquiry. Everybody knows that the ferry will come off
in the end, but it would be opponents of the bridge who would be making
most noise.
''The point remains, however, that although the Secretary of State has
the final say, the RUCCS either has a legal right to call an inquiry or
it doesn't. That has to be resolved.''
RUCCS chairman, Mr Lawrence Kemp, is anxious his committee retains the
power. He said: ''We have now written to the Scottish Office telling
them that we are proceeding on the basis we still have that power,
unless we are instructed otherwise. We have also raised the matter with
Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney because it was the Railway Act
that created the RUCCS.''
Mr Kemp said CalMac would be asked to advertise the proposed
withdrawal and objections should be submitted to RUCCS. A public inquiry
would only be called if there were sufficient objections.

The threatened rises, which Ottawa says would provide Canada with

Administrative delays, not any softening in Canada's stance, pushed the

A MAN who stabbed to death a pub magician was jailed for 11 years
yesterday.
James McKay, 33, of Dundee, was found not guilty of murdering Mr Alex
Mitchell, of Arthurstone Terrace, Dundee, in the Lothian Arms pub in
Whitfield Drive, Dundee, last December. However, a jury found him guilty
of culpable homicide.
McKay claimed that Mr Mitchell, an amateur magician, threatened him
with a tumbler and that he struck out with a knife in self-defence.
Some members of the jury looked shocked after returning their verdict
and then heard that McKay had a total of 37 previous convictions for
various offences including assault and robbery, a firearms charge, and
for possessing an offensive weapon.
Lord Gill told McKay at the High Court in Glasgow he had been found
guilty of the grave crime of killing Mr Mitchell and had an appalling

WHILE just walking around Edinburgh during the Festival offers
famously free entertainment, the wealth of public events, smaller
festivals, parks, galleries, and museums open to the public for no
charge is less well known.
The fourth edition of Edinburgh for Free has just been published by
the women's committee of the district council, and as befits the first
city in Britain officially to be designated child-friendly, many of the
suggestions will appeal to the young.
The wee yellow booklet is a salutary reminder that all of us can
delight in the country's treasures free of charge at many of the major
museums and galleries.
These include the Royal Museum of Scotland, the National Museum of
Antiquities, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and the Scottish
National Gallery of Modern Art.
However, the booklet's real value is in its compilation of the city's
secret attractions. Anyone with a fascination for money can examine
ancient banknotes, old Scottish coins, and more modern relics such as
sixpences and florins at the Bank of Scotland Museum on The Mound.
Lothian fire brigade has a museum that includes vintage fire engines.
The story of fisher-folk is told in music and on video at Newhaven
harbour, while the development of farming communities can be traced from
horse-drawn plough to combine harvester at the Scottish Agricultural
Museum at Ingliston.
Animal lovers can visit Gorgie city farm, the cat and dog home at
Portobello or, by arrangement, tour the police dog kennels and stables.
All the parks are listed in the booklet with a system of symbols to
denote whether play facilities are suitable for toddlers, juniors, or
seniors. Suggestions for visits and walks bring a reminder that
Edinburgh is a collection of villages of individual character all worth
exploring: Leith, Newhaven, Cramond, Colinton, Swanston, and Dean
Village.
Apart from the late summer cultural crescendo, there is a series of
mini-festivals -- next on the list is next month's science festival
which includes a number of free events.
The Edinburgh Fling, at the end of April and beginning of May, offers
everything from sport to music, exhibitions, and walks, free or at low
prices. In May, the International Children's Festival in Inverleith Park
also offers some free activities -- and there are attractions of some
sort every month until the Hogmanay Street Party.
* Edinburgh for Free is available (free) from Women's Unit, City
Chambers, High Street, EH1 1YP, and from city libraries.

Jean Sandison, tells of the daily triumphs and tears of a single
mother in
the Highlands as she copes with a spirited daughter whose ambition is
to lose
herself in the supermarket
A SINGLE parent has to learn to live without luxuries. You don't think
about them because it just makes you unhappy.
A sweater and a pair of jeans cost anything up to #60 these days, and
where is a single mother going to find that kind of money?
After buying the necessities, I spend any cash I have on Jessica, my
two-year-old daughter. But watching other women choose a new dress, or
an attractive top in one of the inviting shops in the Eastgate Centre in
Inverness where I live, can be depressing.
If I have only a few things to buy I let Jessica walk, which she
always wants to do, because shopping with a push-chair is horrendous.
We spent most of our time weaving in and out, dodging people, waiting
for lifts, struggling with doors and over-loaded bags.
Life for a single parent is not just about having no money. Nor is it
simply about a child without a father. It is also about all the other
things couples take for granted: sharing daily tasks, baby-minding,
dreaming dreams, planning for the future, and right down to opening
doors and helping with the shopping.
And my little darling gets bored very quickly with shopping, and soon
refuses point-blank to go into yet another shop.
I explain that mummy is not having much fun either, and that I would
also rather be at home, doing much more interesting things. But to no
avail.
I recall one incident when I needed a pair of jeans. Every time I
turned into the shop Jessica screamed wildly, shouting in protest. The
sales assisant watched this performance for days until, finally, I
arranged a baby-sitter and made a quick dash down town.
The assistant smiled knowling and asked: ''And how is your little lady
today?''
Mind you, it's an entirely different matter when Jessica decides it is
toy-time, a fact I will remind her of when she is older and wants
clothes for herself.
No matter what I plan, we invariably end up in the toy shop. But it is
interesting to watch her with other children.
Jessica is bossy -- takes after her mother, I suppose -- and it can be
embarrassing. If anyone stands in the way of the push-chair she yells at
them ''move'', or ''go away''.
If a child or baby is crying, Jessica tells them to ''shut up''.
Mothers look at me admiringly and asks if I would like to do a ''swap''.
This is amusing and brightens shopping expeditions enormously --
except when we go to Safeways. Because our flat is so small, the moment
Jessica is confronted by wide-open spaces she is off like a shot. Most
children choose a park, but not Jessica. She waits until Safeways.
I try to keep her in the trolley for as long as possible, but she
crawls out and escapes before the second aisle. There are small trolleys
at the check-outs in which hand baskets are stored. If Jessica spots an
empty one she grabs it and is off full speed before I can mutter butter.
I pretend I have no idea whose child she is and continue shopping.
I hear her calling: ''Jean, where are you?'' all round the shop, until
some poor old lady comes limping round the corner, quickly followed by
the manager expressing grave concern about my daughter causing grievous
bodily harm to customers. Nearby family parties ''tut tut''
disapprovingly.
I rent a three-room flat in Inverness: bed-sit, kitchen and bathroom.
Our home is in a convenient, quiet and friendly part of town. It is
close to good shops, a medical centre, church and an excellent school
which I hope, eventually, Jessica will attend.
But I was brought up in the country and have fond childhood memories.
I want Jessica to share that experience and I dream of a cottage, a
garden, a cat and some dogs, of course, a car. And, who knows, perhaps
someday, even a husband. I want more -- anybody in my position would.
Happily, Jessica and I can visit my friend, Fiona, who lives with her
husband in a cottage at Hopeman on the Moray Firth, where we walk along
the beach and occasionally hill hike.
We climbed Bad a'Churaich (409m) by Lochindorb recently. Jessica
wanted to walk alone, and, for once, could do so safely. Carrying her
down was even nicer.
It was a big difference from going from street to street, shop to
shop. That's not very exciting for a vibrant two-year-old. Nor, for that
matter for her mother.
But at least we can come home to our own flat; which is a whole lot
more than many single parents can, and I count myself very lucky indeed.
And I have Jessica. No matter what happens, at end of the day, that is
all that really matters.

ONE of the last male bastions south of the Border has fallen with the
news that the Rugby Football Union has reluctantly agreed that women can
become full members of the RFU National Committee.
The historic decision follows a temporary county court injunction
taken out last month by Mrs Beverly Ann Davis, of Helston, Cornwall,
preventing the RFU from hindering her from standing for election as
Cornwall representative on the RFU.
Cornwall RFU had been told by the secretary of the RFU that women were
not eligible for membership of the RFU committee, and Helston RFC
secretary Mrs Davis was concerned that potential voters would be put off
from voting for her because of doubts about her eligibility to stand.
However, the RFU committee has now decided unanimously that its rules
do allow women to sit on the national committee.
Ms Hilary Slater, principal legal officer at the Equal Opportunities
Commission, which backed Mrs Davis's court action, said yesterday that
the EOC was delighted with the RFU decision which recognised that women
could make a valuable contribution to the administration of the game at
national as well as local level.

RUGBY, bowling and cricket yesterday became Scotland's latest National
Lottery beneficiaries when they received awards totalling #76,000 which,
matched by their own efforts under the terms of the grants, will create
new facilities worth more than #167,000.
Jed-Forest Rugby Club receive #37,300 to help provide new changing
rooms, toilets, showers, tea-room, kitchen, and referee's room.
Cononbridge and Maryburgh Bowling Club, Ross and Cromarty, will put
their #28,300 towards a clubhouse and games hall, and Glenrothes
Development Corporation has been awarded #10,000 to build a cricket
square.
Last week, the Scottish Sports Council's Lottery Sports Fund announced
grants totalling #1,869,500 to the country's first seven projects.
Following yesterday's awards, Mr Graeme Simmers, the SSC chairman,
said: ''This reflects the diversity of sports and geographical areas
that lottery money will help. We are delighted by the quality and
variety of applications received so far, as they demonstrate the
potential to build for Scottish sport and the community at large.''
The council has a duty to ensure that all parts of the country and all
sports benefit from the lottery, but Edinburgh South MP Nigel Griffiths
has already complained to the SSC because he believes Edinburgh has not
received its fair share of lottery funds so far. Priestfield Tennis and
Sports Association got #24,700 in the first tranche of awards.

CENTRAL Scotland Police have been praised for the appointment of a
specialist worker in the force's Family Unit to give support to victims
of domestic violence.
Mr John Boyd of thePolice Inspectorate said the job was unique in
Scotland.
And he added that he would monitor its progress with particular
interest -- an indication that it may be recommended to other forces.
The worker's remit, Mr Boyd said, was to provide after-care, support
and advice to women who have been victims of repeated domestic violence.
Mr Boyd also praised Central's five-year persistent young offender
project.

THE NHS pay dispute deepened yesterday when a leaked management letter
confirmed that not all nurses and midwives would receive 3% increases
from a combination of national and local bargaining.
Health unions saw this as the realisation of their fears that not only
would few nurses receive the full 3% supposedly on offer but that other
NHS workers, who were not even offered the 3% ''carrot'', would fare
even worse.
The dispute centres on a planned 1% across-the-board rise recommended
by the NHS workers review body for 600,000 nurses and midwives. It was
subsequently offered to NHS administrative and clerical grades, hospital
ancillaries, and ambulance workers, all of whom have rejected it.
NHS staff who criticise the award as miserly have been told individual
trusts are mostly agreeing to increase the 1% national offer and at the
weekend Health Minister Gerald Malone issued an appeal to nurses to
settle the dispute as most would get the full 3%.
But a letter from Mr Ken Jarrold, director of human resources at the
NHS headquarters in Leeds, to district and family health authorities,
shows not every hospital is expected to meet the demands.
Mr Jarrold states: ''It must be a matter for each employer to
determine what is fair, bearing in mind their revenue position from
purchasers and local labour market considerations. It follows in line
with the review body's expectation that there will be a range of local
settlements and that all trusts will not make offers at the top of the
range.''
The confidential internal NHS letter has angered the unions who have
argued throughout that the full 3% should be funded nationally.
Mr Bob Abberley, head of health at Unison, said the leaked letter
proved that the real agenda behind the push for local pay negotiations
was to cut costs.
Earlier this week ambulance workers' leaders joined the other NHS
grades in rejecting the 1% offer and will participate in a series of
demonstrations tomorrow which they have dubbed -- ''Fair Pay Day''.
Meanwhile, health visitors are today expected to reject a 1% pay
offer.

A PIECE of Scotland's heritage could be about to be swept away under a
new European ruling, it was claimed last night.
Both the Edinburgh Castle hallmark on gold and the lion rampant on
sterling silver has been used in Scotland for more than 500 years.
However, jewellers are concerned that the Scottish hallmarks will be
abolished under a planned European Union directive to be discussed in
Brussels tomorrow.
The EU wants to allow manufacturers to mark precious metals themselves
without any independent checks.
The hallmarks have been put on metals in Scotland by the independent
Scottish Assay Office in Edinburgh since 1473.
Mr Michael Laing, chairman of the assay office, said that the hallmark
was the most enduring form of consumer protection in Britain.
He said tourists actively sought out jewellery products carrying a
Scottish hallmark, and getting rid of the mark would have dire economic
consequences.
Mr Laing added: ''This is the unacceptable face of Europe. In this
case, they are trying to strip away the character that makes a country
different.
''To take away the castle from our gold and the lion rampant from our
silver, which was introduced as far back as 1473, is to take away all
the charm. We must make a stand for our heritage.
''Scotland brought the hallmark system in to stop people passing off
coins made of brass as gold in the fifteenth century.
''Whenever people saw the hallmarks, they knew exactly what they were
buying. There was many a time when people bought what they thought was
gold abroad. It had been marked by the manufacturer as gold, but when
they got back to Scotland, they found it was nothing of the sort.
''I am worried that will happen more and more if manufacturers are
allowed to mark the metals themselves.''
Mr Tom Murray, law clerk of the Scottish Assay Office, said Scotland
should not be allowed to lose its distinctive hallmarks.
He said that if the EU directive was brought in, the assay office
could still test precious metals, but could not put any distinctive
Scottish hallmarks on them.
However, he added that there would be no call for the manufacturer
even to present them for analysis.
Pressure was growing last night to try to stop the Government from
voting for the change in Brussels.
Edinburgh Lord Provost Norman Irons has pledged his support, and in
England, where the hallmarks are also under threat, representations have
been made to Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade.
Earl Ferrers, Minister of Consumer Affairs, who will vote in Brussels
on Thursday, is also being lobbied by Scottish jewellers.
It is believed EU officials feel that British hallmarks on precious
metals are against the policy of free trade between countries.

THE Liberal Democrats have chosen Stephen Gallagher, candidate in the
Monklands East by-election, to succeed Sir Russell Johnston in the fight
for the new parliamentary seat of Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber.
Sir Russell, MP for Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber, is standing down at
the next election having been in Parliament since 1964. In the 1992
election he had a 458 majority.
The seat is a four-way marginal: Sir Russell last polled 13,258 votes;
Labour's David Stewart came second with 12,800; the SNP's Fergus Ewing
12,562; and the Conservative John Scott 11,517. The Green candidate John
Martin polled 766 votes.
Mr Gallagher, a hospital manager with Argyll and Bute NHS Trust,
attracted only 878 votes in Monklands and lost his deposit.

THE Prime Minister has dismissed all talk of a snap General Election
and made clear he will fight any challenge to his leadership.
He said there was no reason to believe he would call an election
before spring 1997.
''I have lots I wish to do. I intend to go on doing it. I have no
intention of being distracted at all,'' Mr Major said in an interview in
today's Daily Telegraph.
He also defended his gaffe-prone party chairman Jeremy Hanley, and
ruled out an imminent Cabinet reshuffle.
''I have not begun to contemplate a reshuffle yet,'' he said. ''There
will not be one for some time. Whether it will be in the summer, I can't
yet say.''
The Premier was interviewed in the run-up to next Thurday's local
elections in Scotland where his party faces a drubbing.
They will be followed by council elections in England and Wales on May
4, where the Tories can look forward to a similar fate.
Labour leader Tony Blair last week put his party on stand-by for a
snap election, but Mr Major insisted: ''This is a five-year parliament.
We were elected for five years. I have no particular reason to believe
it will be much shorter than that.''
Asked about any potential stalking-horse preparing an autumn challenge
to his leadership: a leadership challenge, Mr Major said there were
plenty of things he still wanted to achieve.
''I am very concerned to ensure we entrench non-inflationary growth. I
have always wanted to break the inflationary psychology in this country.
''We are closer to doing so now than we have ever been and it will be
of lasting benefit. I intend to see that job through,'' he said.
He also talked of his desire to broker a permanent peace in Ulster and
see through his 10-year plan to improve public services.
He brushed aside suggestions that a spell in Opposition would be good
for the party, saying: ''There is no joy in Opposition. Political
parties don't exist to be in Opposition.
''The belief that you could go into Opposition, sit down for five
minutes, come up with some bright new ideas and then bounce immediately
back into Government is juvenile.''
Mr Major also expressed confidence in his beleaguered party chairman,
urging him to ''shrug off'' criticism.
''It is a tough job being party chairman, but I expect Jeremy to go on
doing that job,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>Row hots up over insurance cover for lawyers as 'destroyed' builder claims damages. Minister enters #2m legal wrangle</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Office Minister Lord Fraser has stepped into the bitter row
between the Law Society of Scotland and a Paisley housebuilder who is
claiming damages of #2.3m from two firms of solicitors.
Mr Iain McIntyre, whose story first appeared in The Herald last year,
alleges that lawyers' incompetence has destroyed his business and his
health.
The issue has been taken up by Mr McIntyre's MP, Mr Gordon McMaster
and in response to a letter from the MP, Lord Fraser has now contacted
the Law Society of Scotland, the solicitors' governing body.
Two weeks ago, Mr McIntyre staged a demonstration at the Law Society's
AGM at Gleneagles as part of of his campaign against the operation of
the Master Policy for Professional Indemnity Insurance which compensates
the clients of negligent solicitors.
Mr McIntyre alleges that the policy is protecting lawyers at the
expense of clients and is campaigning for an end to self-regulation of
the legal profession.
Both the Law Society and insurance companies claim that the compulsory
insurance system works in the public interest.
Mr McIntyre's problems began when his Paisley solicitor failed to
reserve a right to construct an essential road link between two phases
of a housing development.
The housebuilder consulted a second solicitor in Glasgow and was
advised to continue an action at Paisley Sheriff Court to declare the
existence of a legal right to build the road. That action was dismissed
by a sheriff as ''hopelessly incompetent''.
The first lawyer has admitted negligence and a conveyancing expert has
stated that it is ''patently obvious'' that the second firm was
negligent -- but Mr McIntyre has been battling for compensation for
eight years.
There is apparently a vast gulf between Mr McIntyre and the insurance
companies over the value of his claim and the case may have to be
thrashed out in the Court of Session.
Lord Fraser has now written to Mr McMaster saying that he is sorry to
hear about Mr McIntyre's difficulties over such a long period.
The Minister adds: ''You may be interested to know that in response to
concerns expressed to me on this and other cases, I am writing to the
President of the Law Society seeking his comments on the role of the
society in negligence cases and whether he is satisfied that the society
is having sufficient regard to its statutory duty to safeguard the
interests of the public as well as those of the profession.''
A Law Society spokesman said yesterday: ''The president has received a
letter from the Minister in regard to the handling of negligence cases
and he will be responding at length tomorrow.''
The response from Law Society President Mr Kenneth Ross will
presumably re-inforce the comments he made at the Gleneagles AGM when he
stated that clients of solicitors in Scotland are provided with a
consumer protection unrivalled anywhere else in the world.
The Law Society leaves the negotiating of individual claims in
negligence cases to the insurance companies. Both the society and Sun
Alliance, lead insurers, deny that claims are deliberately spun out to
grind clients down so that they settle claims for much less than they
are worth.
Mr Alan Stephens, of Sun Alliance, told The Herald: ''There is no
basis for that allegation. The insurers consider every claim on its
merits and in the vast majority of cases in which the insured is liable
a speedy settlement is achieved.
''The longer a case drags on, the greater is our exposure to costs and
interest on damages. It is in the interests of all parties in a valid
negligence claim that it should be settled quickly, amicably and on
terms that are fair to the claimant and to the insured.
'Before the Master Policy was instituted, 25% of solicitors were
uninsured. Those who had insurance often had low limits of indemnity and
restrictive cover, whereas now the policy guarantees consistency of
cover and a minimum cover of #1m per claim.''
Glasgow solicitor Mike Smith, who until recently acted for Mr
McIntyre, alleged yesterday that the Law Society faced a fundamental
conflict of interest between its obligations to the legal profession and
the public.
He said: ''The interest of the legal profession and the Law Society
appears to be based on keeping the premiums payable by solicitors as low
as possible.
''Since each year's premiums are calculated on the claims record of
previous years, it is not in the profession's financial interest that
clients of negligent solicitors are immediately and fully compensated.
''The way ahead must be for there to be a separate policy protecting
clients rather than solicitors. The Master Policy should be done away
with and individual firms should make their own arrangements for
insurance.
''The argument against this is that some solicitors will not be able
to obtain cover. If they are not, it is a good recommendation not to use
them.''

In certain company, a great nostalgia wells for all those hushed and
haughty haberdasheries where, above the curved mahogany counter, a
hand-lettered sign would announce: Men's Shirtings.
Anne Simpson meets the perfect shirtman, whose mission is to take us
back to poplin and mother of pearl buttons
THE perfect shirtman has just dropped by from London, collar styled
with impeccable spread, no fraying at the points, and stripes graded
sophisticatedly in different widths of colour, a thin peach running
between fatter strips of bottle green and grey.
As he reaches into his portmanteau of shirt tales we notice that his
cuffs extend only half an inch below the sleeves of his distinguished
jacket, each one chained, of course, by a small gold lozenge,
expensively plain. From collar to cuff he is an ode to symmetry.
''Now this will surprise you,'' he says. ''The urbane Glaswegian is
very much alive.'' Teeth clenched, we mutter that what surprises us is
that a man as refined as he should allow condescension to mar finesse.
For a second a pale smile quivers his cheekbone. ''Forgive me, what I
meant is that research from the menswear industry confirms the executive
Scot as the owner of more shirts than his counterpart anywhere else in
Britain.''
This is more like it, but where do such findings leave those
conspicuous shirt-purchasers from the penthouses of London's Docklands;
those captains of technology who despatch secretaries to Jermyn Street
every other day to pick up shirts in finest poplin? ''Ah ha,'' says the
perfect shirtman, ''such men are obviously good for business, but they
can't be considered collectors. They simply buy and throw away. But the
Glaswegian who cares about his appearance may have as many as 20 shirts
in tip-top working order.''
The perfect shirtman is building to a fugue of retail chatter: ''In
gatherings of international businessmen, the Scot is better groomed than
his English brother, who allows a certain seedy fatigue to develop about
the waistline.'' It seems this wretched individual buys his shirts too
short in the tail, which causes them to ride up in an ugly ruck above
the trouserband. But the Scot, selecting a bespoke shirt, prefers the
tail to be one inch longer than standard measurements, an inherited
trait derived from ancient canny kilt wearing, perhaps, the longer sark
having been a sort of wind-breaker for the nether regions.
A classicist in his taste for detail, the perfect shirtman has peddled
rounded French cuffs, reinforced gusset tabs, boned collars, and
mother-of-pearl buttons for almost 30 years. Not only that, his own
company has been dealing with the foibles of the market for more than a
century. Not a dandy but a master craftsman, he prefers to shirt the
heirs of old money, the inheritors of suave experience rather than
upstart tycoonery. And, wherever they are in the world, men in his
shirts recognise one another instantly. Total strangers, detecting the
proper distance between shirt stripes on another, the ideal depth of a
collar at the back, will exchange discreet salutes in restaurants,
first-class travel lounges, and luxury hotels. ''We are like a club,''
says the perfect shirtman. He calls his customers disciples.
Chief among them are royalty, reigning and fallen, but the perfect
shirtman is too trusty to disclose any regal chit-chat that might
transpire across the tape measure. ''All I will say is that in the past,
when others knew Winston Churchill as a mighty statesman, we simply knew
him as 46 and short.'' As for the lifespan of a shirt, much depends on
how many a man buys in one go. Bulk purchase of a dozen is advised,
which should mean that each shirt lasts a year.
''After that a stylish man should retire his shirts and start again.''
But much also depends on the services of a good laundry. In the perfect
shirtman's opinion, too many attack shirts with such ferocity the collar
shrinks and the wearer's neck ends up feeling in the grasp of a villain.
For this reason a good shirt should be cut with a 2% tolerance to cope
with the onslaught from detergents and boiling water.
Not all that long ago traditionalists in matters of menswear would
talk not about shirts but shirting. You don't hear that word today yet,
once mentioned in certain company, a great nostalgia wells for all those
hushed and haughty haberdasheries where, above the curved mahogany
counter, a hand-lettered sign would announce: Men's Shirtings . . .
The phrase sounded mysterious, exclusive, but given the toffee-nosed
aura of such places it's a wonder anyone had the nerve to approach the
salesman. What if he considered the customer unworthy? Worse still, what
if he didn't and promptly cornered the shopper, insisting: ''I have
precisely the shirting you desire, a finely woven, embossed cotton at
#75 which can only be purchased in packs of 10?
Surely today that kind of price must still steal the shirting off a
person's backing. The perfect shirtman disagrees and the pale smile
returns to tweek his features. His gentlemen, he explains, would never
be so prosaic as to fret about cost. Why should they? They hold elegance
by the shirt tails -- not that they are ever ones to boast.

THE Prime Minister yesterday stepped in to defend rail privatisation
after a strong attack on the new regime by outgoing British Rail
chairman Sir Bob Reid.
Sir Bob, who steps down on Friday after five years as chairman, said
in a newspaper interview that trying to make privatisation plans work
would be ''a nightmare''.
He also said that selling off Railtrack would create a vastly
expensive bureaucracy -- and admitted standards had already slipped and
the quality of service to customers had ''fallen away''.
Labour seized on his comments, but Mr Major told the Commons: ''The
Labour Party have tried to smear every privatisation that we've had,
just as they are trying to smear this privatisation.''
He said Sir Bob had expressed such views before and had argued for a
''monolithic, vertically-integrated railway''.
Mr Major added: ''He was unable to persuade us that this was the right
way to proceed.''
WITHDRAWAL of BR's Fort William sleeper service may be illegal Mr Bill
Walker, Conserative MP for North Tayside, said yesterday.
He believes the decision does not comply with the consultation
procedures for line closure laid down in the Railways Act 1993.
Mr Walker yesterday tabled an emergency Commons written question
calling on Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney to ensure that the
service is kept on until the procedures ''which Parliament has laid down
for the protection of the travelling public have been carried out.''

THE Prime Minister yesterday signalled a likely overhaul of the
courts-martial system as a direct consequence of the acquittal in
Germany last year of a lance-corporal accused of murdering a 16-year-old
Glasgow girl.
Fresh legislation may be introduced in the next parliament.
The 24-year-old soldier was set free last year amid allegations that
the prosecution case had been bungled and that the trial should have
been held in a civilian court.
It was made known yesterday that Mr Major had expressed his deep
sympathy for the parents of Christina Menzies, and said he would be
happy to meet them to discuss their concerns. It is an invitation that
will be taken up.
''I can well understand their very close interest in seeking an
overhaul of the courts-martial system,'' the Prime Minister stated in a
letter to Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead.
In the Commons yesterday, under the umbrella of parliamentary
privilege, Mr Galloway declared that Corporal Darren Fisher was the
killer of Christina Menzies -- even though he had been cleared of her
murder by a court-martial.
Corporal Fisher still is a serving soldier in the Royal Logistics
Corps. At one time, he applied to join the SAS, but failed its rigid
entrance course.
Mr Galloway told Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman: ''The
military police, who are just soldiers with armbands, and the military
prosecutor, who was just a soldier in a wig, bungled the case.
''The murderer then walked free and is still at large, serving in Her
Majesty's Services. Is it not about time we overhauled the archaic
system of military justice, which is widely discredited?''
Mr Freeman told him: ''I think the whole House will understand the
grief and concern of the parents concerned, and anyone who is a parent
will share their deep shock at their tragic loss.
''It is not up to Defence Ministers to reopen that particular trial.
The trial has been heard and you have deeply held views about its
progress and conclusion. It is not for a Minister of the Crown to
re-open that trial.
''However, I believe that when we debate the Armed Forces Bill it will
be perfectly appropriate to raise the question of procedures used within
the Services, including the courts-martial procedures.
''I am sure it will be entirely appropriate to raise that matter on
the floor of the House or during committee, and I look forward to that
occurring.''
Last night, Christina's mother agreed that it now looked probable that
the law would be changed, and it was unlikely that a similar situation
could happen again.
However, Mrs Christine Menzies remained bitter against the Army.
''Christina was a dependant . . . a nobody.. under British military
law,'' Mrs Menzies said. ''She was not even entitled to her own name on
her death certificate. She was described only as the daughter of Staff
Sgt John Menzies.''
The parents were even billed by the Army for the return of her body to
the United Kingdom. Staff Sgt Menzies' commanding officer eventually
picked up the bill.
Mrs Menzies said last night that following the court-martial, the
Germans themselves had lost all confidence in the British military
system of justice.
Following the murder of her daughter, the Germans were now insisting
that deaths involving British nationals should be tried in civilian
courts. She knew of at least three other cases.
Had the murder been committed in the United Kingdom, there would have
been no question that it would have gone before anything other than a
civilian court, Mrs Menzies said.
Staff Sgt Menzies and his wife were in the public galleries to hear
what seemed to be the first stage towards victory in their campaign to
have the courts-martial system revised.
However, they have been strongly urged not to pursue a case for
damages in a civil case against Corporal Fisher -- mainly on grounds of
costs -- nor to continue their campaign to have the soldier tried for
perjury during his trial.
Mr Galloway said that the Prime Minister's response had been both
sympathetic and sensitive. It implied that there could be changes in
future to courts-martial procedures.
Staff Sgt Menzies also welcomed the response from Mr Major. Up until
then, he said, all he had received were standard bureacratic responses
or otherwise points raised by him and his wife were just ignored.
''It was all wrong at the court-martial,'' he said. ''The could not
even find a bible to enable Corporal Fisher to take the oath before
giving evidence. This case should have been held in a civilian court.''
The girls's body was found beside a motorway near the British military
base at Gutersloh in June 1993. She had attended a disco at the base.
She was strangled or suffocated some time after leaving the disco.
Her parents, having set a curfew were out searching for her, when she
left the base for another disco.
The court-martial was told that forensic evidence linked Corporal
Fisher to the crime.

The Natural Law Party launches its local election campaign in
Edinburgh, claiming it could dramatically cut the law and order budget
by introducing transcendental meditation in prisons.
Mr Duncan Paterson, the NLP's Scottish affairs spokesman, said prisons
were places of great stress and existing rehabilitation for prisoners
did not work.
''Transcendental meditation reduces hostility, improves behaviour and
improves mental and physical health,'' he said.
The benefits could lead to a drop in crime, with a lesser burden on
the police and judiciary and could lead to prisons being closed, he
claimed.
''Transcendental meditation could reduce incarceration costs by half
and the costs of the judicial system could be reduced substantially,''
said Mr Paterson.
The NLP also outlined policies for successful government by reducing
stress in society and education, and a promise to develop the full
potential of every student through consciousness research.
The party is to field 13 candidates in Edinburgh and three in Glasgow.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland is set to go upwardly-mobile in the north
of Scotland and fill a gap left by its big rivals, the Bank of Scotland.
Royal will announce later this week that it is extending its mobile
service to Durness, Sutherland.
The Bank of Scotland in Golspie announced recently that it was
withdrawing its service to Durness, Scourie and Kinlochbervie because of
concerns over security.
It said it regretted the move very much but the safety of staff came
first.
The decision had been taken after a visit to the north by the bank's
security inspector who had not been satisfied by the service provided by
a private car rather than a bank van.
The bank's Edinburgh headquarters had said that the amount of business
in north-west Sutherland did not justify the financial outlay on a
security van.
There was local outrage and now the Royal has stepped in.
A spokeswoman said yesterday: ''We already run a service to
Kinlochbervie and Scourie in our purpose-built, environmentally-friendly
bank van and we will now be happy to extend this service to Durness.
''We will shortly be putting out a new timetable which should begin on
April 17. We were the first in the world to introduce mobile banking --
on St Andrews Day, 1946 -- and we would now be happy to serve any new
customers, business or private, in Durness.''
She said that the bank had already picked up 40 new accounts in the
north-west.

A 24-HOUR monitoring service for people at risk of a heart attack was
launched yesterday.
Cardiac Alert is a portable hand-held device, costing #500-a-year,
which allows subscribers to record their own ECG wherever they are, at
any time.
The reading can be sent via telephone to cardiologists staffing the
Cardiac Alert Monitoring Centre. An interpretation can be given within
minutes and immediate action taken if necessary.
In addition to the annual rental charge, there is a joining fee of
#550, which covers an initial cardiovascular examination, cardiologist's
consultation, and base-line ECG.
This base-line figure can be compared with later readings to give a
clear indication of any problems which may arise.
The Cardiac Alert service gives those at risk unlimited access to a
professional verdict on their symptoms as soon as they occur.
Vital minutes saved can minimise irreversible damage to the heart
muscle and save lives.
This type of service has been used successfully in the USA and other
parts of Europe. A similar service in Israel has resulted in a reduction
in the average period of patient delay from more than three hours to
just 44 minutes.
The service is overseen by Dr Ulrich Sigwart, Director of Invasive
Cardiology at the Royal Brompton Hospital, West London.
More information on subscribing can be obtained by telephoning
0171-352 8585.

A WOMAN who stabbed her husband to death after suffering years of
violence at his hands was shown mercy by a judge yesterday.
Lord Mayfield admonished Mrs Agnes McKenzie, 60, who is
wheelchair-bound after suffering a stroke while in prison charged with
murdering her husband of 38 years.
Mrs McKenzie's solicitor, Mr Derick Williamson, said at the High Court
in Edinburgh: ''I believe Lord Mayfield's decision shows that our system
of justice is tempered with mercy and kindness.
''I hope this will bring to an end a terrible chapter in this poor
lady's life.''
Six months ago, at the High Court in Glasgow, Lord Mayfield deferred
sentence on Mrs McKenzie. He said he was entirely satisfied that she had
suffered years of violence from her husband James, 64, and had struck
only when attacked again.
Mrs McKenzie pled guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide,
admitting stabbing her husband in their home in Kilchoan Road, Glasgow,
on December 4 last year.
The judge told her: ''It so happens you had a knife in your hands for
domestic purposes, and I am satisfied you had no intention of killing
your husband.''
He was told that Mrs McKenzie had been released on bail after
suffering a stroke while in prison awaiting trial for murder. This had
left her paralysed on the left side.
She was was taken into court in a wheelchair by her two sons and a
daughter, and sat outside the dock. The judge said: ''You are not in
good health and I do not feel that a custodial sentence is necessary.''
Mr Ian Peebles, QC, prosecuting, said there was evidence from the
family, neighbours, and other sources that Mrs McKenzie had been
assaulted physically and verbally for many years.
On the day of the killing, her husband had been drinking heavily and
at one stage had knocked off her spectacles in front of a neighbour who
was in the house.
Later, Mrs McKenzie, who was covered in blood, ran to a neighbour's
house and said: ''I've stabbed and killed him.''
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, said the couple had been married for
38 years and there was an abundance of evidence that Mrs McKenzie was
the victim of frequent assaults.
She tried to hide her injuries from neighbours, and if the marks were
visible would say she had had an accident. But her family and neighbours
were well aware she was the victim of violence.
Mr Findlay said Mr McKenzie's drinking had increased over the past few
years, and with it the violence. The drinking had led to an unfounded
obsession that his wife was unfaithful.
That Saturday, he had again accused her of being unfaithful and
attacked her while she was preparing a meal.
''He came at her and she was so terrified of another beating she
struck out with the knife she was holding, and a fatal blow was
struck.''
She had suffered a paralysing stroke in prison and had been told that
further strokes were a possibility. Fortunately, she had a loving and
caring family who would look after her.
Mr Findlay said he was pleased to report that Mrs McKenzie had not
been involved in any further trouble.
Lord Mayfield said: ''I am pleased to hear it, too. I remember the
facts and circumstances of the case, which are very sad. In the
circumstances, I will admonish you.''

<HEADLINE>Government in U-turn over transport access for disabled</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
By Our Political Staff
THE Government's package aimed at tackling discrimination against
disabled people cleared the Commons last night as Ministers bowed to
cross-party pressure over opening up access to public transport.
The Disability Discrimination Bill was given a third reading without a
vote and now goes to the Lords.
The legislation makes it unlawful to discriminate in connection with
employment and provision of goods, facilities and services, and sets up
a National Disability Council to advise Ministers.
However, after a surprise Government U-turn last night it will also
include provisions to increase accessibility to coaches, buses and
trains through the imposition of minimum access standards for new public
transport vehicles.
The Minister for Disabled People, Mr William Hague, announced in the
report stage debate: ''In the light of the representations that have
been made, the Government is now preparing to introduce provisions at a
later stage which will amend existing legislation or, where necessary,
introduce new powers covering buses, trains, coaches, trams and
underground systems.''
However, he emphasised that it was in no-one's interest to bring
forward measures that would ''jeopardise the viability'' of public
transport operators.
Ministers were concerned to ensure ''time scales for the introduction
of accessibility requirements reflect the particular circumstances of
individual modes of transport -- for systems like the London
Underground, for example, we are certainly talking very long term''.
Mr Hague's announcement came after Tory MPs condemned Ministers'
refusal to include accessibility to public transport within its
provisions.
Sir John Hannam (Exeter -- Con.) told the House that the exclusion of
public transport vehicles increased disabled people's ''sense of
isolation and separation''.
Sir John said taxis were ''no substitute to generally accessible
public transport''.
Mr Tom Clarke, for Labour, said it was ''patently absurd'' to improve
access to railway and bus stations under the Bill but deny disabled
people their right to catch a train or bus.
Mr Hague's announcement was welcomed by MPs on all sides, but some
complained the proposals should have been brought forward earlier and
warned they had yet to see the details.
Miss Liz Lynne, for the Liberal Democrats, said: ''It always seemed
crazy that bus and train stations were to be accessible but buses and
trains weren't.
''It would only have been welcomed by disabled train-spotters.''
She asked what timetable the Government envisaged for making transport
accessible.
Mr Hague said that an ''enormous'' amount of discussion had to take
place. ''But I can assure you the Government is absolutely sincere in
our intention to deal with this area.''
Tory ex-Minister Alan Howarth (Stratford-on-Avon) told him: ''If you
asked disabled people what would be their highest priority in practical
terms, many would unhesitatingly say first and foremost transport.''

THE arrogance of Tory English nationalism is fanning the flames of its
Scottish counterpart, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown claimed in
Perth last night.
He spoke of the ''narrow English nationalism of the Conservatives,
which flows through the Government's arrogant contempt for Scottish
institutions and aspirations''.
Speaking on the danger of ''tribalism, intolerance and narrow
nationalism'', he cited the words of Blackpool Tory MP Harold Elletson:
''Throughout the proud and glorious history of the English people, we --
the greatest, the noblest and the most feared race on earth -- have been
called upon to serve other nations throughout the world.''
Mr Ashdown said: ''That is the English nationalism that splutters
apoplectic in the face of any hint of more self-governance for the
Scottish people.''
He added that Scottish Nationalists turned their back on the
outward-looking tradition of the Scots.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang claimed yesterday that Labour's plans for
a Scottish Parliament would disembowel local government and centralise
power in Edinburgh.
At a London news conference on the local council elections, he
launched a pamphlet and a bitter attack on the Opposition's plans as
''illogical, expensive and damaging to local communities.''
Mr Lang said: ''Take the issue of taxation. Not enough attention has
been focused on the implications of Labour's plans to allow their
Parliament to raise income tax by 3p.
''Labour place so little trust in their own Scottish Parliament that
they would seek to cap its tax-raising powers before it is even
established.
''Even a 3p rise in taxation represents a 15% hike in taxes for those
on the new 20p rate of income tax. And would making Scotland the
highest-taxed part of the United Kingdom benefit Scottish business? Of
course not.''
Mr Lang said the Government had only just established a system of
strong, local unitary councils in Scotland.
''Most pressing is the need for Labour to spell out the real effects
of their high-tax, high-regulation Parliament on the Scottish economy.''
But Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson attacked the pamphlet
as ''the shoddiest piece of propaganda from the Tories in a long time''.

THE tourism industry in Scotland must get its act together if it is to
survive the growing international competition, the chairman of Tourism
Training Scotland warned yesterday.
Mr Peter Lederer was speaking at a conference in Glasgow attended by
200 of the industry's key decision makers.
Delegates, including members of trade associations, local enterprise
companies, and area tourist boards, heard fears expressed that Scotland
was not keeping pace with an average 4.3% annual growth in international
tourism.
The concerns have surfaced despite the fact the industry, which
employs more than 170,000, contributed #2100m to the Scottish economy in
1993.
Mr Lederer, managing director of Gleneagles Hotel, said Scotland had
many advantages ''in its wonderful scenery, great people, and
infrastructure'' which included more than 20,000 hotels, guesthouses,
and other accommodation.
However, he said the industry remained ''fragmented'' with a very high
proportion of small, family-run businesses.
He said it was also characterised by a shortage of skills among
management and staff, and a high turnover of employees.
Mr Lederer spoke of the urgent need to mobilise training resources and
explore key issues controlling the industry's effectiveness.
''I believe that tourism in Scotland can and will provide a
world-class quality of service, but it will not be easy,'' he said.
''The world tourism market is growing and changing so rapidly that if we
are not seen as a very high quality destination in terms of service and
products we will be left behind the rapidly changing market.
''If we are to retain our place in world terms we must get our act
together and get much better at what we do.''
* A conference attended by urban regeneration experts in Glasgow
yesterday was told that a #100m refurbishment of Scotland's lowland
canals would attract about two-and-a-half million visitors a year and
lead to a ''significant regeneration'' of Central Scotland.
The figure was revealed in an independent study, carried out by the
ASH Consulting Group and economic consultants Coopers and Lybrand, on
behalf of British Waterways and the Scottish Tourist Board.
Economic consultants have already estimated that 1500 jobs would be
created during a refurbishment of the canal network and more than 4000
jobs once the project is complete in the year 2000.
British Waterways has admitted the project can only proceed if #50m is
secured from the Millennium Fund.

EXCLUSIVE
THE first GP service for the homeless in Scotland is to be launched in
Edinburgh.
The project starts as homelessness reaches an all-time high, according
to Scottish Office figures released yesterday.
From April 4, treatment and medical advice will be dispensed by two
GPs at special surgeries in the Edinburgh Homeless Practice within the
Spittal Street Centre at the heart of the capital.
A medical outreach service for those sleeping rough may also be made
available.
The pilot scheme, which has secured annual funding of #50,000 from
Lothian Health Care, has been geared to the young homeless who are
believed to be slipping through the health care net.
Homelessness in Edinburgh has increased by 300% since 1980, with a
massive increase of 155% among the under 24s since 1988. Edinburgh
District Council estimates there are 3600 homeless people in the city.
Dr John Garner, chairman of the Scottish GP Medical Services'
Committee -- the voice of Scotland's family doctors -- admitted the
homeless often met with a varied response when seeking treatment.
Many GPs, he said, were reluctant to take them on board, but said his
committee would be ''very supportive'' of the new service.
''It is sometimes very difficult for people of 'no fixed abode' to use
a surgery regularly, as patients in the waiting-room sometimes tend to
be put off and because they tend not to be good at keeping appointments.
''We are enthusiastic about this new service as we recognise the big
problem not only in Edinburgh, but in other cities. We are trying to get
medical services to the homeless, who are a fairly mobile population,''
he said.
Mr Peter McLoughlin, Lothian Health Board's homeless services
development manager, said the new initiative was part of an overall
strategy to encourage doctors to take homeless patients on board, either
on a temporary or permanent basis.
''We recognise that existing services are possibly not the best place
for youngsters to attend. We are opening this place for all homeless
people, but we are going to specifically have a focus on younger
people,'' he said.
Studies in England had shown the homeless had special needs, including
a greater risk of respiratory difficulties -- including tuberculosis --
drug and alcohol-related problems and dermatological conditions.
The new service is being promoted through posters and credit
card-sized hand-outs, which will be distributed to the young homeless.
Two GPs have been hired to treat patients at the thrice-weekly
sessions at the centre, which will be held on Tuesdays, from 10am to
11am, and on Wednesday and Thursdays, from 2pm to 3pm. GPs will be on
hand to provide medical advice by telephone half-an-hour before the
surgeries open, and an answering machine will take calls outwith surgery
hours.
Mr McLoughlin said it was hoped to establish a satellite clinic at
another location in Edinburgh, possibly later this year.
Health boards and trusts throughout Scotland will have their eyes on
Edinburgh to see how the service fares in its first 12 months.
''It sets a precedent in Scotland. What we're hoping for is when we
actually open the practice, is to be able to offer advice, help and
reassurance and training to other health board areas.
''We've already had the GP sub-committee in Glasgow writing to ask for
details of what we're doing, saying Glasgow has a similar homeless
problem and they're examining the service delivery to homeless people,''
Mr McLoughlin said.
The scheme has been backed by Edinburgh District Council, but Housing
Chair Councillor Mary Mulligan stressed co-operation between those who
work with the homeless was vital.
The new strategy was also welcomed by the homelessness pressure group
Shelter Scotland, which said it was pleased young people were
particularly being targeted by the new practice.
''We have seen huge rises in homelessness among young people in the
last six or seven years, but we know that they are usually reluctant to
use the services which have been developed for different client
groups,'' a Shelter spokesman said.

ENVIRONMENTAL campaigners last night welcomed the Government's
reported decision to abandon its controversial plan to widen the M25 to
14 lanes.
Ministers have scaled down their plans to turn part of the road around
London into a 14-lane super highway. It will now be only 10 lanes,
according to ITN's News At Ten.
The section between the M3 and Heathrow Airport, already eight lanes,
is allegedly to get only one extra lane on each side, instead of three.
Mr Roger Higman, transport campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said:
''This decision is a victory for democracy.
''But our fight will continue until all the Government's plans for
motorway widening are abandoned in favour of investment in public
transport, cycling and walking.''

On a visit to Scotland, Labour Leader Tony Blair accused the
Government of putting its own, narrow party concerns before the national
interest, claiming that people were becoming increasingly angry at the
damage being done to the country by their behaviour.
He said of rumours of a further Cabinet reshuffle to close
Conservative splits and defend John Major's premiership: ''It is time
their own internal politics stopped taking precedence over the interests
of the country.''
Mr Blair said there was widespread anger at the way the Conservatives
were running the Government, as if protecting their own period in office
was more important than running Britain efficiently.
He was speaking during a tour of the new #38m Edinburgh International
Conference Centre, due to open in September, which he praised as a
perfect example of the New Labour philosophy of co-operation between the
public and private sectors.
The centre is a joint venture between Edinburgh District Council and
Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd, with grant aid from Lothian
Regional Council.
''One of the reasons why there have been such dramatic economic
advances here in Edinburgh has been the imaginative way in which Labour
local authorities have worked with the private sector.''

AFTER 20 years of ownership Mr Keith Schellenberg yesterday sold the
island of Eigg to millionaire German artist Mr Marlin Eckhard, also
known as Maruma, for a reported price of #1.5m.
But the laird is not quitting the island. He is keeping the island's
manse and a bothy.
The sale went through yesterday, said Mr Alexander Thomson, of
Edinburgh solicitors, Biggart, Baillie and Gifford, who had acted as
selling agents.
''All I can say is that the sale took place today by which Eigg Island
Ltd now owns the island and that Professor M E Maruma is the man behind
that company.
''I am only making this statement to bring to an end all the
speculation. There is no doubt the island of Eigg is now sold, apart
from the manse and a bothy which Mr Schellenberg retains,'' Mr Thomson
said.
He declined to confirm that the price was #1.5m. It was thought last
night that Professor Maruma, 41, was still in Germany.
He is understood to be interested in eastern mystical writing and fire
worship. He is said to have become interested in Eigg after a deal in
the Seychelles fell through. He visited the island as Mr Schellenberg's
guest in August.
Reports have been circulating that he wants to build a distillery,
establish a ranch, open a pub, and establish wool working plant on the
island.
Mrs Karen Helliwell, secretary of the Eigg Residents' Association,
said she had not heard about the sale. She added: ''But I can't say we
are particularly surprised.
''As to Mr Schellenberg . . . the sale must be in the overall interest
of the community the way things have developed over recent years.''
Her husband Simon said: ''I think there is a general feeling of
optimism on the island tonight. But this new owner is going to have to
come up with the goods. We will be looking for more than big talk this
time.''
Another of the 72 inhabitants said she was quite delighted by the news
and was sure that 90% of the people of the island would be of a similar
view.
The regional councillor, Lochaber GP Dr Michael Foxley, said that
while it was probably the best thing that the island had been sold it
was a national disgrace the way such land sales were handled.
''There seemed to be an almost total breakdown in the relationship
between Mr Schellenberg and the local community, so a change must be
welcome. But I really am quite disgusted the way that this sale can go
through at the whim of two men who either happen to have a lot of money
or have persuaded a bank to give them some.
''If someone wanted to put a porch on a house on the island there
would have to be consultation, the same with a woodland scheme. If
someone wants to take over a croft they have to prove themselves. But
here we have an island community being bought and sold almost as a joke.
In fact I thought it was an early April fool.
''I am particularly disappointed in the major conservation bodies. If
this was in the middle of the Cairngorms it would be a different matter,
but because it is a populated island off the west coast they don't want
to know. Mr Schellenberg had better not let us down over the houses we
are planning to build for the elderly at Cleadale,'' he said.
Mr Schellenberg was unavailable last night but a spokeswoman said he
would issue a statement today.

A DEPRESSED meat market worker who was still grieving over the death
of his mother carried out an ''inexplicable'' knife attack on a woman
colleague who had shown him nothing but kindness, a judge heard
yesterday.
John Livingston had been brooding over his mother's death after
hearing a radio report about the death of Sir Matt Busby, Lord
Coulsfield was told at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Livingston, 28, was jailed for four years after he admitted assaulting
Mrs Elma Burns, now 57, at Malone's Meat Market, Edinburgh, on January
21 last year by stabbing her repeatedly to her severe injury and
permanent disfigurement.
Livingston, of Craigentinny Road, Edinburgh, was originally charged
with attempted murder but the Crown accepted his plea to the less
serious charge.
Mr Alan Turnbull, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh,
that Mrs Burns was working alongside Livingston and the first she
realised anything was wrong was when she was grabbed from behind.
She had only a sketchy recollection of the attack which left her with
two face wounds, one of which was two millimetres from her jugular vein.
She was also stabbed in the back and sustained a chest wound which led
to a collapsed lung.
Doctors who examined the accused described him as being of below
average intelligence but not mentally ill.
Mr Andrew Hardie, QC, Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, for
Livingston, said he appeared to be a very inadequate young man.
On the day of the incident he was suffering from headaches and was
depressed. He had been thinking about his mother's death after a letter
addressed to her had arrived. There had also been a radio report about
the death of Sir Matt Busby.

PEOPLE throughout Scotland are being asked to sell the family silver,
in an effort to see the successful erection of a statue to one of the
country's most famous sons -- philospher, historian, and diplomat David
Hume.
The Saltire Society's commemorative committee, which hopes to have a
statue in place this year on Edinburgh's Royal Mile, has combined with
auctioneers Phillips to hold a sale later this year.
Yesterday, however, Mrs Kathleen Munro, society administrator, said
that there were no problems envisaged in raising the #130,000 required.
She said fund raising had reached the halfway stage for the statue, by
sculptor Sandy Stoddart, designed in Greek style and in accordance of
the image of Edinburgh as the Athens of the North.
Members of the society, of which the Duke of Edinburgh is patron, are
being invited to offer jewellery, silver or plated wares such as dinner
services, and candlesticks, along with chinaware, textiles, and a range
of other auctionable artefacts.
The sale is planned for September.

LEADING Scottish Nationalist Mr Willie McRae was subjected to a
campaign of terror before his mysterious death on a bleak Highland road
in 1985, a close friend has revealed to The Herald.
Mr Bruce Cilliers claims he and his wife were asked by Mr McRae to
move into his house in Falkirk after it was subjected to months of
attacks by vandals. He said Mr McRae was frightened for his life and
believed he was the victim of a sinister campaign of dirty tricks.
The house, Watling Lodge, had been subjected to burglaries, attempted
arson attacks and had bricks thrown through its windows by a gang of
teenagers.
''It wasn't random,'' asserted Mr Cilliers, ''the house is in a
secluded location and was targeted. No other house suffered similar
attacks.
''Willie was certain that the youngsters were being set-up by someone
to intimidate him.
''He asked my wife and I to babysit for him in case anything happened.
We did for a number of weeks. He felt he needed some form of witnesses.
But he was also frightened and this wasn't long before he died.''
The new revelations follow disclosures in The Herald that bungling by
authorities and a campaign of misinformation have helped cover up the
circumstances surrounding Mr McRae's death. The Herald also revealed
that Mr McRae was probably carrying secret documents about the nuclear
industry at the time of his death.
Mr McRae's car was found 29 yards off the A87 at Loch Loyne on the
morning of Saturday April 6. He was found in the driving seat, the
apparent victim of a road accident.
It was many hours later, when Mr McRae was admitted to Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary, before a nurse discovered a gunshot wound to his right
temple.
A 48-hour police inquiry led the procurator-fiscal at Inverness to
state there were no suspicious circumstances and the then
Solicitor-General, Mr Peter Fraser, ruled against a Fatal Accident
Inquiry.
Aspects of Mr McRae's lifestyle have been used by the Crown over the
years to indicate he was potentially suicidal.
Yet on Friday April 5, 1985, he had shown little sign of being a man
about to take his own life. He told friends that he was close to
completing an important project, but expressed fears that Special Branch
was closing in on him.
The day before his death he was in ebullient form, according to a
client who visited his legal practice on business. He talked
enthusiastically about visiting his holiday cottage in Kintail that
weekend. He later stocked up with a weekend's worth of provisions.
His partner Mr Ronnie Welsh also says Mr McRae was in a jovial mood
all day and when he removed his .22 pistol from the office safe he
remarked: ''Just in case we're raided''.
One close contact confirmed that Mr McRae had packed a pile of legal
books in his car before he set off and had arranged to meet an important
legal client for lunch in Plockton the next day.

THE union representing 27 striking Bulgarian klondikers on the Rotalia
moored off Shetland has asked the Bulgarian state prosecutor to declare
the ship's sale to the Bourgwells shipping company illegal.
The move came on the eve of a Court of Session hearing instigated by
Bourgwells to have the crew evicted.
Mr Plamen Simov, general secretary of the Bulgarian Seafarer's Trade
Union (STU) yesterday lodged papers with the prosecutor in Sofia,
alleging that managers of the bankrupt state company were also involved
in the joint UK/Bulgarian enterprise Bourgwells.
He alleged ''criminal offences'' may have been committed because the
sale of the Rotalia and four other ships three weeks ago was conducted
at an auction with only one bidder -- Bourgwells. The state
privatisation agency had not approved the sale, he said.
A spokesman for the crew sitting in on the ship after three months on
official strike said they feared immediate deportation if the court
ruled against them and they expected victimisation back in Bulgaria.
They have extensive support among the islanders.

SCOTLAND'S greatest author, Sir Walter Scott, got his head back
yesterday. And if he looked a little pensive about the whole business
everyone else was smiling.
It happened in Selkirk where a row blew up earlier this year because a
life-size figure of Sir Walter, installed when the nineteenth-century
courtroom where he once dispensed justice as sheriff was turned into a
museum, was condemned as not looking remotely like him.
Townpeople, local historians and Scott buffs all gave the cadaverous
head the thumbs down. And bowing to criticisms, Ettrick and Lauderdale
Museums Service agreed to behead the figure and hire an artist to
undertake another attempt.
Yesterday a chubbier, more familiar head was duly installed on the
dummy's shoulders by the author's great-great-great-granddaughter, Mrs
Patricia Maxwell Scott, who still lives in his former home, Abbotsford
House, near Melrose.
As she caught her first sight of the head craddled in the arms of
museum curator Ian Brown her face lit up. ''Oh, lovely. That is much,
much better,'' she said.
After installing the new head she added: ''This is a great deal more
like Sir Walter. The other head looked like a very ill old man. I was
too polite to be critical at the original courtroom opening ceremony but
it was not even remotely like Sir Walter.''
The original head was done by a London firm that specialises in museum
contracts. The new one was the work of Melrose artist John Martin. He
took six weeks and used as a guide the famous Chantry bust of Sir Walter
and photographs of drawings and paintings.
''It was one of the more difficult jobs I have done and I was very
aware of the criticisms of the previous effort. However, it seems to
have gone down well. I can sleep soundly tonight,'' he said.
Meanwhile, the disgraced head will have a reprieve of sorts. It will
be recycled to represent someone else in another exhibition.

AMERICA'S ''feel good factor'' film Forrest Gump stole the show at the
Oscars yesterday with six awards -- best picture, best actor for Tom
Hanks, best director, best adapted screenplay, best film editing, and
best visual effects.
No other film came close to matching its success, although it was also
a triumphant night for Britain with four Academy Awards.
Hanks, 38, fought back tears as he collected his statuette, his second
Oscar in succession after winning best actor for Philadelphia last year.
He became the first actor since Spencer Tracy in 1937/38 to achieve a
consecutive double.
Best actress was Jessica Lange for Blue Sky. Quentin Tarantino's Pulp
Fiction won best original screenplay.
Peter Capaldi, who wrote and directed Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful
Life, won Scotland its first Oscar for 34 years.
The black comedy shared an Academy Award for the best live action
short film with the American film Trevor.
On the podium, Capaldi just had time to thank his star, Richard E
Grant, but later said: ''I'm absolutely thrilled. It's tremendous that
the film has been so well received by so many people.''
The movie was funded by BBC Scotland and the Scottish Film Production
Fund's Tartan Shorts scheme, designed as a showcase for Scottish
film-making talent.
The film stars Grant as the author Kafka, agonising over the first
line of his classic Metamorphosis, and Elaine Collins, Capaldi's actress
wife. It also features Phyllis Logan and Ken Stott.
Mr Gerry Capaldi, 67, and his wife Nancy, 62, watched their son
Peter's victory live on television early yesterday morning with their
daughter Stella and some friends.
They had gathered at the family's Bishopbriggs house more in hope than
expectation but had prepared a bottle of Bollinger just in case.
That foresight proved fortunate, with the bottle cracked open as the
family toasted Peter's historic win.
Mrs Capaldi said: ''This has come as a complete surprise. Peter was
amazed when he was shortlisted and when we talked to him on the phone
earlier he still couldn't believe he had won.''
The film-maker who won Scotland's first Oscar in 1962 congratulated
Capaldi on his success. Mr Robert Riddell-Black's company Templar Film
Studios was awarded the statuette as best short film in the live action
category for their Clydeside shipbuilding documentary Seawards the Great
Ships.
British production The Madness of King George, nominated for four
Oscars, won just one for best art direction.
Elton John and Sir Tim Rice shared a best orginal song statuette for
Can You Feel the Love Tonight from Disney's hit The Lion King.
The Channel 4-backed cartoon Bob's Birthday about a dentist with a
midlife crisis won best animated short film.

A GROWING world shortage of a blood product which saves the lives of
thousands of babies is likely to be headed off thanks to the work of
Scottish doctors and scientists.
Edinburgh is to become a world production centre for a
genetically-engineered version of anti-D, the immunoglobulin which
protects the babies of mothers with Rhesus-negative blood.
The synthetic version is expected to be available in about five years,
replacing the increasingly scarce biological product made from donated
plasma.
Doctors and scientists at the Scottish National Blood Transfusion
Service have already spent five years developing the monoclonal
alternative from a laboratory-cultured cell line, but because of the
costs of taking this further, have signed an agreement with Bioscot, an
Edinburgh biotechnology company.
Bioscot, which began life 11 years ago as a spin-off from the SNBTS
and Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt Universities, is now expanding its
production facilities to prepare trial batches of the new anti-D, and
will ultimately manufacture the product for use in Scotland and the rest
of the world.
The problem they are tackling, Rhesus incompatibility, results when a
mother has the Rh-negative blood group, the father is Rh-positive, and
the baby inherits the father's positive group.
The first baby will be all right, but its blood is likely to sensitise
the mother to Rh-positive blood so that her immune system will react
against a subsequent Rh-positive child, causing a potentially-fatal
anaemia known as haemolytic disease of the newborn.
Babies of sensitised mothers may be stillborn or require several blood
transfusions after they are born.

THE owner of a dying horse, which was so weak its legs gave way and it
fell into a river, was fined #250 and banned from keeping horses for
five years.
At Tain Sheriff Court yesterday, Mr Nelson Bradshaw, of Coull Park,
Alness, admitted failing to get the mare badly needed attention from a
vet and causing it unnecessary suffering.
Afterwards, a vet called in by animal cruelty inspectors said: ''I've
never seen anything like it in my career. The horse was so weak and thin
it could not bear its own meagre weight and fell to the ground.''
Mr John Watt, Ross-shire inspector for the Scottish Society for the
Cruelty to Animals said: ''The horse was a picture of total neglect. It
was the most dejected looking horse I have ever seen.''
Mr Watt, said that a friend of the owner was walking the mare on a
path near the River Novar, when the animal collapsed and tumbled into
the river.
Mr Watt added: ''After an almighty struggle, with one man waste deep
in the water, we managed to get her on to the bank.''
The horse was carried, by a forklift tractor, to a stable, but it died
two days later.

SCOTLAND'S leading animal charity yesterday hit out at the country's
court system claiming the difficulties it was experiencing with it had
reached a critical level.
The attack came as the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals released new figures detailing an increasing catalogue of
cruelty involving both pet and farm animals.
Revealing a significant rise last year in the number of cruelty
investigations and in the number of cases lodged with procurators-fiscal
the SSPCA condemned as inadequate a court system which repeatedly failed
to impose realistic penalties on offenders and, in some cases, allowed
people off scot-free.
The organisation said it was also ''worrying'' that in certain areas
of Scotland they knew prior to a hearing being held that the sheriff
would not be ''hard enough''.
Statistics show inspectors received over 109,000 calls for help last
year, compared to 96,000 the previous year.
They carried out more than 4100 investigations into alleged cruelty
offences, compared with 3775 in 1993. A total of 129 cases were lodged
at procurator-fiscal level -- a rise of 23.
Only 25% reached court adding still more to the major backlog of cases
waiting to be heard.
SSPCA chief executive Jim Morris stressed they were getting excellent
support from procurators-fiscal and the Crown Office. ''They must be as
irritated and frustrated as we are that cases are not getting into
court.''
Some cases, he said, were still waiting to come to court from 1993 and
there was even one from 1992. ''This is very frustrating. Everyone is
suffering from the congestion in the courts.
''When cases do come to court the sentences given out to cruelty
offenders are usually small fines which in no way reflect the severity
of the crime.
''The SSPCA believes that banning a cruelty offender from owning or
being responsible for animals is an appropriate sentence.''
On farm animal cruelty cases Mr Morris said they had risen
significantly and the number of animals involved remained high.
There were optimistic signs, however, of an increase in the vigilance
of the farming community which was reporting incidents more and more.
He said the only effective way to combat this cruelty was to implement
a system of farm licensing and to establish an ''open door'' policy
which would allow inspectors access to farming units, particularly
intensive systems where the level of care required is critical.
The society is calling on the NFU in Scotland to show its concern for
animal welfare by supporting these measures.
''We are building bridges with the NFU in Scotland, auctioneers and
academic bodies. If we can act as a catalyst to get everybody to talk we
can reduce cruelty,'' said Mr Morris, who believes there are signs the
NFU is moving towards a licensing system.

<HEADLINE>Court clears Halifax merger with Leeds</HEADLINE>

THE Halifax Building Society has secured the go-ahead from the English
High Court for its plan to merge with Leeds Permanent which will
ultimately result in a windfall of up to #800 for each investor member
or borrower.
Members of both societies will now vote on the proposals in May,
though the payout will have to wait until the merged company goes public
in about two years' time and they will have to maintain their accounts
in the meantime.
The court action was brought by the Building Societies Commission, the
industry's regulator, to clarify 1986 legislation. The court approved
the plan whereas last year it rejected similar proposals by the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester in relation to the bid from Lloyds Bank, because
the Halifax proposed distributing shares rather than cash.
A merger document is now expected to be approved shortly by the
commission and will be sent out to members, who exclude holders of
current or deposit accounts. The aim is for the merger to become
effective in August. The actual value of the payout to members will only
be apparent when the company is floated on the Stock Market in 1997.
Halifax chairman Jon Foulds was delighted with the ruling. ''It allows
us to offer members of Halifax and the Leeds a scheme which we believe
fairly reflects their interests in the societies,'' he said.
The Independent Union of Halifax Staff also welcomed the court
decision and said it would now be pressing for proposals on pay and
conditions for the combined staff of 27,000.
''The employers talk of creating a world-class organisation. We want
to see this defined not only in terms of the number of jobs available,
but the quality and location of those jobs,'' said general secretary Ged
Nichols.
However, Mr Jim French, chairman of the Building Societies' Members
Association, questioned the moral correctness of the share distribution
proposal.
''The whole business stinks . . . the decision is a licence to bribe
the societies' members and borrowers with their own money. If all this
money is in the kitty they should be paying investors more interest and
charging borrowers less,'' he said.

THE Paisley man murdered on Monday night in a Glasgow street had been
shot before and had himself been tried for conspiracy to murder and
attempted murder.
The shooting of Mr Brian Cochrane, 31, in Glenlora Drive, Pollok,
signalled that the drugs-related violence which has swept Paisley in
recent months has spilled over into neighbouring Glasgow housing
estates.
Detectives said yesterday that they are open-minded about motive for
the killing of Mr Cochrane, of Mannering Road, Foxbar.
Detective Superintendent Ronnie Edgar of Govan CID said the officers
were trying to establish why Mr Cochrane was in that area and whether he
had been alone. A handgun was used and people in neighbouring houses
heard a number of reports.
Mr Cochrane was murdered while sitting at the kerbside in his blue
Fiesta. The car appeared to have jumped forward following the gunshots,
ramming the vehicle ahead. Mr Cochrane may have been lured into the
area, where he had no known friends or relatives, and then shot.
When asked if it had the hallmarks of a gangland murder, Detective
Superintendent Edgar replied: ''It is difficult to answer with any
degree of certainty.''
Mr Cochrane managed to crawl from the bloodsoaked car, and was taken
into a neighbouring house, where the householder called police and
ambulance. The wounded man was only able to say he had been shot and
little else. He died in the Southern General Hospital an hour later.
In 1990, Mr Cochrane and his brother, Robert, were shot at close range
as they parked a car outside a house in Ferguslie Park Avenue, Paisley.
Brian Cochrane suffered serious injuries to his arms, chest, abdomen and
back. Robert Concrane had three pellet wounds in his head.
At a trial in Glasgow in July, 1990, Robert Pickett, 25, described as
a former family friend from the same street, was jailed for seven years
for the wounding of Brian and Robert Cochrane and for a knife attack on
Hugh Cochrane, then 28, of Oliphant Crescent, Paisley.
A picture of violence and ambush and counter-attack emerged at that
court, and in a parallel trial, Robert, Stephen and Brian Cochrane were
accused of conspiring to murder and attempting to murder Pickett.
Charges were dropped against Stephen Cochrane and Robert, and Brian
Cochrane were found not guilty.
Only two weeks ago, Paisley man Andrew McLaughlin, 31, was murdered on
his doorsetep in Linwood, the fifth gun incident in Paisley in a few
days.
A police purge, Operation Dragon, is already showing spectacular
results. In the first week, 55 people have been arrested or reported to
the fiscal for offences ranging from breach of the peace to possession
of a sawn-off shotgun. More than 300 people have been warned for street
misbehaviour and 195 visits have been made to pubs and clubs to warn
about the passing of drugs.
Chief Superintendent Mike Currie, head of the Paisley police division,
told The Herald that, in one house in the area last, week cannabis,
Temgesic and other drugs with a street value of #12,000 were recovered.
On the same day, two men were apprehended carrying a shotgun and
ammunition. A high-powered airgun and some drugs were recovered from a
house in Linwood.
On the same day, housesin Kilbarchan and Kilbirnie were raided leading
to the recovery of stolen paintings worth #20,000, a quantity of stolen
clothing and computer chips valued at #33,000. The following day, police
recovered whisky worth #200,000 which had been stolen from Hillington
the previous week and seven arrests were made.
Chief Superintendent Currie said, however, that the force were still
not receiving the level of co-operation required from the public in
connection with the murder of Mr McLaughlin.

FOSTER parents in Strathclyde are leading a campaign to recruit new
carers.
Of the 2300 children in care in the region, only 45% are with foster
parents.
At the campaign's launch yesterday, Councillor Mary Beckett,
chairwoman of Strathclyde's child care committee, said: ''It is
essential that we have foster parents to promote the idea of fostering.
People have the wrong impression that children come into care because
they are difficult, but nine out of 10 children come into care because
of problems with their family situation.''
Mr Ian Gilmour, depute director of child care, said Strathclyde was
looking for 250 more foster carers.
''We are looking for foster carers who can cope with big families of
up to four or five children. We have a small number of children from
ethnic minority groups and are looking for carers from these groups,''
he said.
''We want to ensure that, when Strathclyde region no longer exists, a
sufficient number of foster carers are in place in the new local
authority areas.''
All foster carers in Strathclyde have now been asked to distribute
family finding cards with a contact number for anyone who feels that
they could look after someone else's child.

THE developer of the Pacific Quay scheme for the site of the former
Glasgow Garden Festival, yesterday dismissed the proponent of a rival
initiative as ''an irritant'' and claimed he was out of touch with
reality.
Mr Phil Miller, managing director for Miller Developers, which is
developing the Clydeside location in conjunction with Manchester-based
company CTP Ltd, additionally alleged that architect Mr Geoffrey Jarvis
had seriously misrepresented the nature of his #80m development.
Mr Jarvis has set up a private company, Clyde Festival Gardens 1999
Ltd, promoting a Tivoli Gardens-style development for the site.
Mr Miller, who won a Glasgow Development Agency competition to develop
the 43-acre site, said: ''Mr Jarvis has been asking people what they
want: a garden festival or a business park? It's no surprise that given
that choice people express support for the garden festival.
''But the choice is not that stark, and our scheme has been seriously
misrepresented, virtually caricatured by Mr Jarvis.
''His simplification ignores the extremely high leisure content of our
development, which will feature a national science centre, Imax theatre,
MGM multiscreen cinema, hotel, and numerous restaurants.''
The property developer admitted to a growing frustration with what he
saw as public misperception, fuelled by Mr Jarvis, of his company's
scheme.
Mr Jarvis said last night that far from being an irritant, his company
represented the wishes of a large number of Glaswegians, who felt an
emotional tie with the site of the former 1988 garden festival.
He did not comment when told of Mr Miller's allegations of
misrepresentation against him.
However, he did say he was saddened by the way the situation had
degenerated into a confrontation, and blamed the developer-led approach
adopted by the GDA for muting public debate over the future of the site.

THE Victoria Cross awarded to a young Scots soldier was sold at
Spink's auctioneers in London on Monday for #121,000, the highest price
ever paid for an Army VC.
A spokeswoman said the buyer was an anonymous Briton who made the bid
by telephone.
In 1941, 24-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Keyes, of the Royal
Scots Greys, devised a raid which involved landing from asubmarine 250
miles behind enemy lines in Libya and targeting the supposed HQ of
German General Rommel.
On November 17, Lt Col Keyes and two other men crawled behind the
German guards and braved the front door of the house. They were forced
to shoot the sentry. Leaving Sergeant Terry to defend the bottom of the
stairs, Lt Col Keyes rushed into the first room, with Captain Campbell
behind him, throwing grenades.
When he opened the door to the second room, he was immediately shot.
His companions carried him outside where he died almost at once.
Although the attempt failed on several counts -- the explosive fuses
laid by Lt Col Keyes's companions failed to ignite and Rommel had
already moved to another HQ -- Sgt Terry survived, and Lt Col Keyes was
awarded his VC posthumously.
Born in 1917 in Aberdour, Geoffrey Keyes was the son of Admiral of the
Fleet Lord Keyes of Zeebrugge and Dover. After Eton and Sandhurst, he
joined the Royal Scots Greys in 1937. He had already won the MC and the
Croix de Guerre for other deeds of valour.

A SCOTTISH conservation group has accused European Commission
administrators of ''incompetence'' because a grant awarded in January
has still not been paid.
The Scottish Tree Trust (STT) was due to receive #7300 from the
Trans-European Co-operation Scheme for Higher Education (Tempus) at the
beginning of the year. The money was to be used to fund a youth exchange
visit between Scotland and Romania.
The trust was sent a contract and award letter promising payment
around the turn of the year. But on January 16 this year they were sent
a further letter saying the Tempus programme had moved from Brussels to
Turin, Italy. But the funding for youth exchanges was to remain in the
Belgian capital.
Mr Greer Hart, chairman of the STT, said the upheaval had left the
European Commission in a state of confusion.
He claimed that, despite a number of telephone calls, officials did
not know who was responsible for the grant and when it would be paid.
A total of 24 Scots and Romanians are due to make the trip. Flights
and accommodation have already been booked and those involved have
organised holidays from work to take part, Mr Hart added.

<HEADLINE>Labour presses Aitken over 'arms-to-Iran contract'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979157318</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is demanding a statement from the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury, Mr Jonathan Aitken, after allegations that he was a director
of a company that broke the Government's arms embargo on Iran.
Today's Independent newspaper reports that Mr Aitken, later a defence
Minister, was a non-executive director of BMARC when it supplied naval
guns to Iran in the 1980s.
The newspaper says it has obtained documents showing that Mr Aitken
was sent confidential board reports containing monthly updates on the
#15m illicit order.
Mr Aitken, paid #10,000 a year for his post with BMARC from September
1988 to June 1990, is quoted as saying he was unaware of the order.
The newspaper claims Mr Aitken attended a board meeting on November 2,
1988 at BMARC where a report mentioning the arms project was discussed.
Mr Aitken said he had left the meeting before the board report was
discussed.
''If I had been told BMARC was exporting naval guns to Iran via
Singapore in violation of the Howe guidelines, I would certainly not
have countenanced such exports,'' he is quoted as saying.
Some 140 light naval guns and mounts were sent to Iran from 1986-89 by
BMARC, an arms company based in Grantham, Lincolnshire, in Project Lisi.
The newspaper claims that monthly reports prepared for board members
while Mr Aitken was with the company show that during this time guns
worth #3.8m were shipped to Iran and the company had started to discuss
a second contract -- Lisi II -- allegedly worth #5.9m.
BMARC went into receivership in February 1992.
Labour demanded a personal statement from Mr Aitken and a police
inquiry into the activities of BMARC.
In a swipe at Mr Aitken's recent attack on BBC interviewers, Labour's
trade and industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, said: ''It's not
difficult to see why Mr Aitken has such a strong objection to searching
questions.
''His defence of ignorance simply is not credible.
''We are asked to believe that Mr Aitken, as an active director, was
unaware of an order worth #15m, and did not take the trouble to find out
what trade was being conducted with Iran.''

<TEXT>
A WOMAN in premature labour with twins was sent on an 84-mile dash by
ambulance across three counties because all the nearer hospitals were
full, it was disclosed yesterday.
Mrs Karen Riordan, 31, was shuttled from Bristol to Exeter after being
told all incubators nearby were booked up.
Nurses telephoned at least five other hospitals before eventually
finding the spare intensive care cots.
The incident began when the former teacher went into labour at her
home in Knowle, Bristol, at 3am on Saturday, March 18.
Her husband telephoned St Michael's hospital in Bristol, where his
wife was booked for a Caesarian delivery in April.
Mr Riordan, 30, a teacher, said yesterday that a paediatrician
examined his wife and later told them there were no beds free in the
emergency baby unit.
''The paediatrician had already phoned around and said the nearest
hospital with a cot available was in Exeter. We were both in a panic
because Karen was in labour early and we were flabbergasted at the
prospect of a journey to Exeter.''
The ambulance arrived at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital 13 hours
before the twins were born.
Mrs Riordan and the twins were transferred to Bristol on Wednesday.
Bristol and District NHS Trust spokeswoman said: ''We very much regret
that Mrs Riordan had such an unpleasant experience.''

A CANDIDATE in next week's local government elections had the tip of a
finger bitten off by a dog as she shoved an election leaflet through a
letterbox.
Mrs Rena Latto now faces a painful wait to find out if she will need
skin grafts to heal her finger.
The Kirkcaldy district councillor, who is bidding for the Glenwood
South and Newcastle ward on the new Fife unitary authority, said:
''Maybe it'll win me the sympathy vote.''
The Labour campaigner had delivered leaflets without incident for 40
years when she came a cropper at a house in Glenrothes.
''I'd just pushed the leaflet through the letterbox when I heard this
low growl. I whipped my hand away, but not in time to avoid the teeth of
the labrador-cross.
''When I looked at my finger, the tip of it was missing right down to
the half-moon of the nail. I was stunned. There was blood all over the
place and all I could think of was running home,'' she said.
A neighbour called an ambulance and Mrs Latto was taken to
Dunfermline's Queen Margaret Hospital for treatment and an anti-tetanus
injection.
She has since had further treatment at Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital
but it will be weeks before she knows whether the wound will heal itself
or if she will need skin grafts.
''It's really sore. I've had to get painkillers to ease the ache. It's
been a real shock to my system and that's my campaigning finished,'' she
said. ''How could I keep my hand warm going round the streets in this
weather?
''Going round houses, you're always keeping your eyes and ears open
for dogs. But I've been campaigning since 1954 and this is the first
time anything like this has happened to me. Hopefully, it will be the
last.''
She said that police had spoken to the pet owner who had sent her a
note apologising and wishing her a speedy recovery.

<HEADLINE>Frederick West's family at war over his body</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979157321</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A FAMILY row broke out yesterday over the disposal of the body of
alleged mass murderer Frederick West.
West, 53, was found hanged in his prison cell on New Year's Day and
his body was collected on Monday by his son and daughter, 21-year-old
Stephen and Mae, 22.
They were understood to be arranging a cremation at an undisclosed
location.
The body had lain in the city mortuary at Birmingham since West's
death at Winson Green Prison where he was on remand accused of 12
murders.
Birmingham coroner Richard Whittington later formally released it for
collection by Mrs Anne Marie Davis, 30, West's youngest daughter by his
first marriage to Scot Catherine West.
But yesterday, West's brother Douglas said at his home in the
Gloucestershire village of Much Marcle that he had not been told the
body had been collected.
He criticised Stephen and Mae for not keeping him informed.
''They have gone about it all wrong,'' he said. ''As far as I know, no
other member of the family knows anything about this. I have not been
told what is going on and neither has Anne Marie.''
His wife, Christine, agreed that it had been a ''complete surprise''
when they learned the body had been collected.
He added: ''It does not matter what he has done or has not done. He is
my brother and we should be allowed to pay our last respects.''
A full inquest on West's death has yet to be held.
He stood accused of 12 murders in connection with the Cromwell Street
inquiry.
His alleged victims included his wife Catherine, 25, whose remains
were uncovered in a cornfield near Much Marcle and his stepdaughter
Charmaine, eight, whose remains were found at a former family home at 25
Midland Road, Gloucester.
The remains of nine other alleged victims were recovered from his
house and garden at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. They included those
of his daughter, Heather. The remains of nanny Anne McFall, 18, were
recovered a few hundred yards from the cornfield grave of Catherine
West.
The Crown has formally dropped all the murder charges against
Frederick West.
His son Stephen was one of the few people allowed to visit him in his
remand cell. Stephen, married with twins, has claimed in a newspaper
article that his father confessed to all the murder charges against him.
West's second wife Rosemary, 41, is on remand in Durham Prison. She
has been committed for trial at Winchester Crown Court in October
accused of 10 alleged murders. Her victims are said to include her
stepdaughter Charmaine and her daughter Heather.

ONE man out of 138 employees at the Blackwood Mill in Kilwinning will
definitely not be losing his job. Mr James Morgan, 64, will retire in
May after 37 years of service in the spinning of yarns.
The one he now spins is that he is disappointed about his date of
birth. If born in September, he would have been eligible for redundancy.
He is not, but so many more are.
Wandering among the looms, spinning machines and bales of yarn, trying
to concentrate on the jobs they have lost is a cross-section of a
community that has been sunk.
Young men, husband-and-wife teams, and the faces of older employees
show a cheer which masks stunned acceptance. Kilwinning folk say the
town of 15,000 died on the day they paved the main street.
If so, the closure of the Blackwood Mill is the delayed gravestone
which sits on top a 12% rate of unemployment.
But not everyone views it that way. Mr Mike Thomson, commercial
director of Irvine Development Corporation, said he would be visiting
the factory today in preparation for marketing the space for other
potential employees.
Mr Thomson said he regretted the news, which he said came at a time
when much of the news in the area was good. He said: ''We have to look
ahead. Blackwood Brothers are not our tenants, but we often have
inquiries from people with specific requirements which we cannot meet at
once.
''Despite the fact that we are selling off our portfolio of properties
in advance of the wind-up of the corporation, we will still have a role
in conjunction with Enterprise Ayrshire in attracting investment and
making sure those who wish to invest are properly served.''
In the Market Bar 71-year-old Findley McLaughlan talks of his mother
working at the mill for years, then called Busby Spinning. Pub patrons
join him with talk of setting their clocks by the seven and one o'clock
horns, of the stench of burning wool scrapings, and jobs for life.
Over a drink, Tommy Kilpatrick talks of joining Busby 19 years ago,
seeing it taken over by Blackwood, and learning that morning from the
radio that, at 39, he was almost certainly redundant.
''We should have been told before the press. It's a bad way to learn,
and I just started laughing. We had seen it coming and management has
just denied it to keep us working.''
Barmaid Betty McMahon said: ''It's just a terrible blow. There is
nothing left in Kilwinning, this will now be a ghost town. Kilwinning
now comes under Irvine New Town, so we don't even have our own
identity.''
Years ago, mill employees had their identities stamped on them. If you
worked at the mill, you were a ''milldumper''. James Morgan could
probably remember that along with the days before he drove the forklift
truck. ''When I worked as a labourer, before packing machines, I used to
tramp the wool down with my feet.''
He will collect his pension from May 13 when he turns 65. He said he
has been happy here and is sorry for the men much younger. Robert Smith
is a branch chairman of the Transport and General Workers' Union as well
as working in the mill's research and development area, installed less
than two years ago at a cost of #600,000.
''I'll probably have to head down south to search for work. It's not
going to be easy. Everyone is just stunned. A week ago on Wednesday we
were told by management that we were not shutting down, that we were not
being taken over, and now this. There won't be a lot of work done
today.''
In the staff canteen, a group of three women shake their heads
unhappily, don't want to talk, nothing to say. Dejected and depressed.
Blackwood Mill, because of it's position in the heart of the community,
employs a number of husbands and wifes.
Redundancy will be a double-barrelled shotgun blast through the
budget, tearing up holiday plans, and shredding children's dreams. News
arrives, that after management's recent dismissal of closure as
''rumours'', one employee signed up for a mortgage he may now be unable
to pay.
Elaine Breen, 41, is both a shop steward and employee with more than
15 years experience. Still wearing the earplugs that protect her from
the deafening din of a row of whirring and spinning machines, she says
that she has not had time to take stock of the news and financially how
she can cope.
Mrs Breen said: ''We've been told that the first jobs will go 90 days
from Monday. There is a possibility that 60 jobs may be moved to
Kilmarnock, but that is still to be worked out.
''A lot of the workforce are shocked, there are many people who have
worked here since they left school.''
That shock will ripple across the little town of Kilwinning as shops
lose vital trade and yet more of its populance packs up and leaves
looking for work and lost hope.
In one of the giant warehouses, what looks like bales of bathmats are
fed through a press. One employee explains that it is yarn that has been
coloured and has now been hung out to dry.
The irony is not lost on him, or the town of Kilwinning.

THE SCOTTISH textile industry suffered a devastating blow yesterday
when the firm which makes the internationally famous Pringle sweaters
announced it was axing more than 400 jobs.
Dawson International said it is to close its contract knitwear plant
at Arbroath, Tayside, with the loss of 221 jobs, and its carpet yarn
plant at Kilwinning, Ayrshire, with the loss of 138 jobs. A further 53
jobs are to go at Hawick in the Borders. Details of further cuts are
expected soon.
Dawson is forecasting profits, before tax and exceptional items, of
#23m, but Pringle of Scotland will incur a trading loss. The prestigious
brand is most famous for its sporting links with golfer Nick Faldo and
more recently a sponsorship deal with the Scottish international rugby
team.
Last night unions said they would do all in their power to get Dawson
to reverse its decision to cut jobs in areas where unemployment is
running at more than 12%. Labour said the cuts made a mockery of the
Government's claims that the recession was over.
The group dropped the bombshell as part of sweeping changes which also
include the resignations of its chairman and managing director. It
blamed its problems on a mild winter in the northern hemisphere and
depressed retail markets -- particularly Germany -- at a time when costs
were increasing to cope with expected sales growth.
Chairman Sir Ronald Miller has resigned from the Edinburgh-based group
and is succeeded by Mr Derek Finlay, who retired two years ago from the
board of Heinz. Mr Nick Keunssberg also resigned as managing director to
be replaced by Mr Peter Forrest. A chief executive is also to be
appointed.
The shake-up involves a restructuring ''with immediate effect'' at
Pringle, Dawson's main knitwear and clothing brand business. The
restructuring would refocus the business, and as a result the Arbroath
factory, which largely supports the contract knitwear business, is to
close.
Closure of the Kilwinning factory would follow the concentration of
yarn spinning work at other plants in Kilmarnock and Cumnock to reflect
low levels of demand for quality carpets.
Elsewhere within the group a distribution and administration centre in
Huddersfield is to close, with the total cost of the restructuring put
at #10m. There will also be 22 ''infrastructure'' jobs lost at various
locations in Britain and a further 40 in Germany.
Communities which will be affected by the cuts reacted with anger to
the news.
Angry civic leaders in Arbroath later hit out at Dawson, claiming they
were not given any warning of the redundancies which will add to
Arbroath's lengthy dole queues. The Angus town already suffers an
unemployment rate of nearly 15%, the highest in Tayside.
Last night Angus District Council depute provost George Suttie said:
''This is a devastating blow for employment prospects in Arbroath. I was
disappointed that the first we learned of this was through the media.
The company must have had some idea of these developments in advance and
could have consulted the council for help and advice.''
The council was yesterday attempting to make contact with the company
in a last-ditch effort to save the jobs.
Mr John Dorward, economic development convener at Tayside Regional
Council, said: ''I find it irresponsible that the company should just
land this on the workforce and the town without representations being
made to the council and other parties.''
The news came as a bitter blow for Kilwinning which, as part of the
Irvine New Town development area, had been enjoying an improvement in
employment levels in recent years.
Despite these improvements -- and the promise of 500 jobs over five
years by the Turkish textile company Merick -- the area still has an
unemployment level in excess of 12%.
Blackwood Brothers, the carpet yarn spinning and dyeing division of
Dawson International, supplies the top end of the carpet manufacturing
industry from factories at Kilwinning, Cumnock and Kilmarnock.
The company said the decision to consolidate spinning at Kilmarnock,
which employs 350 and Cumnock where 80 people work, with the gradual
rundown of Kilwinning and 138 job losses, had been taken with regret but
was necessary to secure the continued operation of the business.
Their decision was met with dismay and disappointment by local MP
Brian Donohoe. Senior officials of the Transport and General Workers'
Union began immediate talks.
Joint managing director of Blackwood Brothers, Mr Gus MacDonald, said:
''This decision is necessary to secure the continued success of our
plants at Kilmarnock and Cumnock.
''It has come about through fierce competition from yarn suppliers in
the UK and Europe, an increase in the cost of wool which our customers
find difficult to pay, and flat retail sales which show little sign of
recovery in the foreseeable future.''
A senior TGWU official, Mr George Hodge, said: ''I do not see this as
a fait accompli and we are beginning talks immediately with a view to
finding other ways of dealing with the problems which the company faces.
We will do everything possible to secure the future of the Kilwinning
factory and the jobs of the Blackwood Brothers employees.''
Mr Donohoe, MP for Cunninghame South, said: ''I am extremely
disappointed by the company's announcement this morning. It is clear
that the whole of Dawson International is in chaos with this
announcement and the departures of Dawson's chairman and chief executive
as well as the departure of the chairman of the company's Pringle
subsidiary.
''This announcement demonstrates the crisis situation affecting many
companies which are teetering on the edge of closure and makes a mockery
of the Government's claims that the recession is over.''
Mr David Macdonald, chief executive of Enterprise Ayrshire, said:
''Enterprise Ayrshire has worked closely with Blackwood Brothers for
many years. The gradual run down of the Kilwinning plant is further bad
news for an area already suffering from high unemployment.
''We are pleased, however, that our joint efforts have secured the
future of the Cumnock operations as well as the main factory at
Kimarnock. By concentrating yarn spinning in these two locations, there
is no doubt that the medium to long term viability of Blackwoods will be
substantially enhanced.''
At Pringle's Glebe Mill in Hawick news of the 53 axed production jobs
was broken to workers when they arrived for the morning shift. And from
the GMB union came the warning that a further 24 jobs could go in
clerical and administrative departments.
As workers emerged grim faced through the mill gates in driving snow
at lunchtime yesterday many hurried past saying they had been instructed
to say nothing.
But Mr Billy Brunton, of Havelock Street, father of two with one
daughter at college, said: ''It is devastating. I've lost by job and got
30 days notice. I have not been out of work for a long time but now I
have to face up to it.''
Mr William Huggan, of Burnfoot, said: ''The mood in there is not good
at all. There's not much chance of finding work in this town for those
who have lost their jobs. I'm all right but my son has lost his job. His
wife had a baby two weeks ago. He now has two children and a mortgage
and I don't know what he's going to do. It is sickening.''
Mr Archy Kirkwood, MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, has arranged to
meet Pringle's new top management in Hawick on Monday to discuss the
implication of yesterday's moves for the future of the company.
He said yesterday: ''The loss of 53 jobs is a body-blow to the town
and its economy. There will be a lot of uncertainty this week. I was
also taken aback by the cuts in senior management. People like Graham
Hayward (axed Pringle MD) has made a significant contribution to the
local community and organisations like Scottish Borders Enterprise.
''This morning I have been told that there is nothing fundamentally
wrong with the business but we need to know that the latest changes will
help the long-term viability of the firm and secure the jobs that are
left.''
The GMB secretary for the Borders, Mr John Farries, said he would be
pressing for a rethink on the numbers of redundancies during the
consultation period that will follow the announcement. Talks start
today.
Dawson's new chairman, Mr Derek Finlay said: ''These are very
disappointing results and the board is taking the necessary actions to
strengthen the management of the group and address areas of
underperformance.
''We most firmly believe that Dawson International can develop its
businesses, building on strong market positions, technical expertise and
reputation for fine quality and service.''

THE Northern Ireland peace process was on hold late last night as it
became apparent to the British Government that President Clinton has not
forced Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to deliver a commitment to the
hand-over of IRA weapons.
Sinn Fein has delivered a letter to the Northern Ireland Secretary,
Sir Patrick Mayhew -- a three-page document -- which Sir Patrick and
Northern Ireland Office Minister Michael Ancram were studying last
night.
But Mr Adams has not yet delivered what the British and Irish
Governments require -- a definite commitment to deliver offensive IRA
weapons like Semtex explosive and ground-to-air missiles.
It seemed unlikely that the next crucial stage in the peace process
can begin this week because Mr Ancram, who is in charge of the
negotiations, is not yet satisfied. Mr Adams has still to deliver a
definite commitment that would allow a British Minister to include them
in talks without offending the Ulster Unionists.
Today the Prime Minister and his Northern Ireland Ministers will
discuss the Gerry Adams letter to Mr Quentin Thomas, the Northern
Ireland Office civil servant who is in charge of these exploratory
talks.
Last night Ministers were not yet convinced that Sinn Fein can deliver
the IRA into negotiations without dropping the IRA insistence that the
British Army's weapons should also be ''decommissioned''.
Downing Street stressed the Government view that talks about weapons
and explosives held by terrorists could not be put on a par with arms
legally held by the Army and the RUC.
A spokesman said: ''What we are not prepared to do is to enter into
negotiation with Sinn Fein about the way in which we deploy the security
forces in Northern Ireland.''
The Irish Prime Minister, Mr John Bruton, held a longer-than-expected
two-hour session in the Irish capital with Mr Adams yesterday.
Afterwards Mr Bruton said he remained ''fairly confident'' Sinn Fein
would get together soon with Mr Ancram.
Mr Adams also remained outwardly optimistic, declaring: ''Our wish and
our aim is to move the peace process onwards.
''We want to see an end to the British Ministerial ban on contact with
our party, and it is our conviction we will see that.''
But he criticised ''the absurdity'' of the British position, claiming:
''I think they are still locked in the psychology of war.
''They seem unable to turn to the psychology of peace.''
Mr Bruton -- who had appeared highly optimistic of an end to the
deadlock when he spoke in the Dail before seeing Mr Adams -- said his
Government hoped to ''assist in bridging the relatively small gap that
remains between the two positions on this''.

Brussels
BRITAIN risked wrecking European Union solidarity in the North
Atlantic fishing war last night when the Government made clear that it
would veto Community trade sanctions against Canada.
British officials in Brussels will meet Spanish demands for sanctions
against Ottawa head-on tomorrow when diplomats gather for a routine
meeting with a European Commission report on potential trade measures
against the Canadians high on the agenda.
One UK official said last night that he accepted there were doubts
about the legality of the Canadians' controversial action in arresting a
Spanish fishing boat and cutting the nets of another in international
waters off Newfoundland.
''But we believe trade sanctions would be illegal -- and we cannot
meet illegality with illegality,'' he said.
The Germans have privately voiced support for Britain's stand and
later last night the Irish indicated they would be on Britain's side if
the Commission agreed with the UK that sanctions were illegal.
The British decision will infuriate the Spanish, whose 1500-strong
fishing fleet is Europe's biggest and who have led calls for tough EU
sanctions against the Canadians. Spain yesterday announced it would
pursue Canada in the International Court in The Hague.
But Britain's stand plainly delighted the Canadians, whose public
response was carefully restrained. ''We welcome signs that this affair
is being treated as the fisheries and conservation issue that it really
is,'' a spokesman for the Canadian mission to the EU said.
Under strong pressure from the powerful Spanish fishing lobby, the EU
has accused Canada of piracy on the high seas.
The tough British line will go some way towards regaining lost Tory
support in UK fishing communities, where there is fury at the
concessions made to Spanish and Portuguese whose boats will soon fish
some British waters while British boats are being decommissioned.
Britain's tactic is to invoke the Gatt agreement on international
trade which lays down obligations on the EU's member states. The
agreement's legalities are now overseen by Gatt's successor, the World
Trade Organisation (WTO). Britain interprets the agreement as making EU
sanctions against Canada illegal.
Under EU procedures, the imposition of trade sanctions against the
Canadians would require unanimity in the Council of Ministers. The
suggestion would probably go first before trade ministers and then
foreign ministers.
But the Foreign Office is apparently determined that these stages will
never be reached. Under Brussels procedures, the basic work for the
council agenda is always done by senior diplomats negotiating privately
in a group called the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper).
The committee will meet tomorrow to debate the latest developments in
the halibut war in which the Canadians say they are acting in the
interests of conservation, and the EU says they are in breach of
international law. Britain's diplomats will make clear at this meeting
that the UK has a veto and will not hesitate to wield it in the
interests of cooling temperatures and encouraging negotiations.
Talks continued in Brussels yesterday but only at a technical level.
There was doubt that senior EU figures would be in touch with Canadian
government ministers after the latest incident in which a Canadian
patrol boat sliced the nets of a Spanish trawler, the Pennare Uno, at
the weekend.
Much now depends on whether the Canadians can convince world opinion
that the Spanish were indeed fishing illegally and threatening the
survival of a species when the freezer trawler Estai was intercepted and
seized earlier this month after a Canadian patrol boat fired warning
shots.
Canada's claims that the boat had a hidden hold for fish and that 80%
of the fish were undersized have been flatly denied by EU inspectors
from Britain who boarded the vessel after it was released and its
skipper allowed out of court on bail.
The Canadians then produced a section of net said to have been
recovered from the seabed after the Estai cut it free as it was being
challenged. Mr Brian Tobin, Canadian fisheries minister, insists the
net's mesh was too small.
If this proves to be true the Estai will have been found in breach of
regulations.
* In the Commons, Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave warned
Canada not to risk losing the moral high ground by taking illegal and
potentially dangerous action. He called on Canada, Spain and the EU to
''cool the rhetoric'', writes Benedict Brogan, Political Reporter.
Pressed by MPs on both sides of the House to support Canada's actions
against illegal Spanish practices, Mr Waldegrave emphasised the need for
an enforceable agreement reached through negotiations.
He was repeatedly challenged by Tory MPs to give assurances that the
Government would not side against a member of the Commonwealth. MPs from
fishing constituencies and two whipless rebels reminded Mr Waldegrave
that public sympathy lay with Canada.
In his emergency statement, Mr Waldegrave said Britain wanted to use
its ''unique position'' as a member of both the EU and the Commonwealth
to help find a solution to the dispute.
Labour Fishing spokesman Dr Gavin Strang said the Government should
ensure that the EU's case against Canada and in defence of Spain should
be ''fool-proof''.
Liberal Democrat MP Jim Wallace said: ''The reason the Canadians are
enjoying so much support from the British fishing industry is that
they've shown a bit more vigour in enforcement than we've seen so far
from the EU.''
Mr Waldegrave replied: ''Out of this dispute, I believe we can get a
tougher enforcement regime in that fishery, which will be a precedent
for tougher enforcement in the fisheries nearer home, and that is a
prize which we should go for.''
Dr Norman Godman, Labour MP for Greenock and Port Glasgow, told Mr
Waldegrave: ''I know of no Scottish fisherman who has any sympathy for
the Minister's position or the Spanish position. We need an
international fisheries police force, perhaps under the United Nations
blue helmets.''

NOW that Dunbartonshire Enterprise has acquired that controversial
land at Drumkinnon Bay, on the southern shore of Loch Lomond, we are
promised a tourism-led development to capture the economic potential of
the loch.
DE has paid #2.6m for its 77 acres. But who will pay for the ensuing
development, initially costed at between #50m and #80m? The private
sector I hope, says the enterprise company's chief executive Donald
MacInnes. If MacInnes is forced to dig deeper into his own budget to
pump prime the scheme, the most he expects to find is #10m over six
years.
That inevitably means that the core of the proposed development will
have to be capable of delivering a sound commercial return. That means
retailing, catering and, possibly, a hotel. Any visitor attractions
incapable of turning a profit will be built only if that commercial core
is there too.
As that reality dawns, some of the local amenity groups which have
welcomed the land purchase may start to have second thoughts. But they
will be fighting a losing battle. The age of the private sector
financing publicly inspired projects is now with us and both Government
and Opposition are singing from near-identical hymn books in their
approach.
''Britain badly needs capital investment across the whole range of our
infrastructure . . . one potent way of providing it is through promoting
a partnership between public and private finance.''
''There can be few cases of public-sector activity which cannot
benefit from increased investment and private-sector involvement.''
The first quote is from Messers Brown, Prescott, and Cook in Labour's
Financing Infrastructure Investment, a consultative paper published by
Labour in February 1994. The second is from Chancellor Ken Clarke in
Breaking New Ground, the Treasury's 1993 introduction to the
Government's Private Finance Initiative.
Don't be fooled by this rare display of political consensus. The real
challenge -- translating such aspirations into real privately funded
roads, hospitals, prisons, sewerage works, schools even, on the ground
-- needs much more than fine words to deliver the promises made for it.
This week Strathclyde region fired another round in its war of
projections with the Scottish Office over the true costs of the
Government's private finance initiative (PFI) compared with traditional
methods of financing public infrastructure. The focus of this complex
dispute is water and sewerage treatment plants, more than #1000m of
which are needed in Scotland over the next few years to replace our
crumbling Victorian inheritance and comply with tougher European
regulations.
Last October, Strathclyde was arguing that the BOO (Build, Own, and
Operate) schemes envisaged, under the PFI, for water and sewerage, would
cost both council taxpayers and business ratepayers more than twice the
traditional option, councils borrowing from the National Loans Fund. The
Scottish Office hotly disputes the region's figures. It argues that
competition for BOO schemes and more commercial discipline in their
operation thereafter will provide ''value-for-money solutions''.
Strathclyde has now released a further analysis commissioned from
Chemical Bank which compares the alternative ways of replacing the
existing Dalmuir sewerage treatment works in Glasgow, where the capital
cost is put at #102m. This time the cost of the Government's BOO scheme
is estimated, not at double, but at between 44% and 55% higher than
conventional Loans Fund financing, depending on how much risk the
successful private bidder takes on. Chemical Bank says the BOO schemes,
as planned, still fail any reasonable value-for-money test. The Scottish
Office insists that analysis is flawed.
The problem for you and me is, that by the time we find out whose
figures are right, it will be too late. We'll be paying the bills,
whatever they turn out to be.
In this particular spat, the Scottish Office has already made one
major concession. Last September it changed the guidelines to turn BOO
schemes into BOOT (Build, Own, Operate, and Transfer) schemes, that
allows the transfer of schemes back to the public water authorities in
certain circumstances, reducing the residual risk for operators.
Chemical Bank says the banks simply would not have lent money under the
original guidelines. After all, there's not much you can do with a
sewage farm other than process sewage.
But there's another fundamental reason for believing that some of the
schemes emerging under the private finance initiative may not be all
they are cracked up to be. Take roads where, under local government
reform, the Scottish Office will in future be the main player.
Will the active promotion of DBFO (Design, Build, Finance and Operate)
road schemes -- where private operators will be paid a shadow toll based
on traffic volumes in return for d'ing, b'ing, f'ing, and o'ing the
stretch -- save the Scottish Office lots of money in the same way that
BOO schemes are supposedly a value-for-money way of providing public
water and sewerage services?
Not a bit of it. Under the old arrangements, the Treasury, not the
Scottish Office, paid the interest on the public capital raised to build
roads and other departmental infrastructure. Under the new arrangements,
a significant element of the shadow toll payments will cover the cost of
capital to build the roads in the first place.
That brings us to the nub of the issue. When it was first promoted the
private finance initiative was supposed to be about creating new
infrastructure, in addition to the Government's own ongoing investment.
Now, in areas like health, there are strong reasons for believing it's
actually intended as a substitute for publicly funded projects, the
quicker to shrink the public-sector borrowing requirement.
There's no shortage of consortia, from the banks, construction
companies, and facilities management companies, willing to bid for PFI
projects. But most of the people involved, in my experience, are
increasingly frustrated at the snail's pace of progress. So far only the
lawyers are making money. They'd never say BOO to a golden goose.

LOCAL politicians, if they have any sense, keep quite about their wee
trips around the world. Or at least make out that the sojourns abroad
are arduous and absolutely no fun at all.
Frances Duncan, the convener of Tayside Regional Council, has happily
chosen a welcome change from the usual routine by having published a
small monograph entitled Convener's Trade Mission to China.
It is her own blow-by-blow account of a visit to the People's Republic
of China in January this year on behalf of the workers of Tayside. So
enthralling is her account that we may have to serialise it over the
next three or four editions of the Diary.
The Convener's Tale begins on Sunday, January 15:
''On waking this morning I knew today was going to be different. Yes,
I leave for a 10-day trade mission to China. First I had to check the
weather. Were the roads blocked by snow (meaning a hurried change in my
travelling arrangements) or would everything go to plan? All is well.
''I sit on my suitcase to lock it. No doubt it's been a waste of time
to press and carefully pack my summer clothes. What a lovely thought --
setting off for warm climes when everyone at home is shivering in the
cold. (Especially the old folk who were promised a #10 winter warming
allowance in the Tayside SNP election manifesto but didn't get one --
Diary interjection.)
''My transport arrives on time and I give last-minute instructions to
Ron about meals in the freezer, changing towels, undies, socks etc. He's
heard it all many times over the past 24 hours!''
The story continues in this vein and by Page 2 of this ripping yarn,
we have reached London Heathrow:
''Once there we have four hours before checking in for our next
flight. Time hangs heavily and each member takes a turn to watch over
the hand luggage while others pass the time by wandering round the
airport and browsing in the duty free shops.'' (Told you it was
riveting.)
The narrative races on and we find ourselves on the plane with the
convener: ''After dinner, followed by my favourite cup of tea, I want to
reach for a cigarette (it is a no-smoking flight) ah, well, the enforced
abstention can only be good for my health! By 9.30pm I think it is a
good idea to settle down for the night. Inside a pack supplied by the
airline I find a pair of socks and ear plugs which I put to good use. I
also unpack the blanket provided and blow up the neck rest I bought
specially for the occasion. A film is about to start on the monitor but
I decide to give it a miss.
''I ask for a cup of tea about 2am and with it I get a small filled
roll. If I sip my tea slowly and take small bites of my roll it will
help pass the time. I try to read but time is slow in passing.
''Life aboard begins to stir. Do I smell cooking? It must mean
breakfast at 4am. I have lost eight hours on the journey. It is 12 noon.
We touch down at Hong Kong on time -- 2.20pm.''
(Excuse us as we skip over the convener's stop-over in Hong Kong for a
''complete wash and change into something light and dressy''. We pick up
the story as the Tayside trade mission arrives at their destination in
China.)
''I make my way to the minibus along with the other members of the
delegation only to be gently guided to a limousine and am joined by a
number of Chinese gentlemen and suddenly a police car wails into life.
''The loudspeaker belted out what sounded to me like 'Get off the
road' or words to that effect, and cars, lorries and rickshaws ran for
their lives. Woe betide anyone too slow, for the people in the police
car either threw what looked like bottles or sprayed the offending
vehicles.''
(On arrival at the hotel.) ''The car doors were opened by Indian
Sikhs. Two more then opened the hotel door and a geisha girl pressed the
lift button. Life was never like this in Tayside.
''All the others on the delegation had a bedroom but I had been given
a suite with, by the way, two bathrooms. The management had kindly
gifted me 12 red roses, a bowl of fruit, tiny biscuits, and rose petals
in water. While some members headed for the bar, others, including
myself, had a long leisurely bath and straight to bed.''
* Next in the Convener's Tale -- Mrs Duncan visits a coconut juice
canning factory and has dead blood extracted from her neck by a faith
healer.
* The Convener's Trade Mission to China is published (presumably at
council taxpayers' expense) by Tayside Regional Council. The above
extract has been ripped off totally without permission.
Davie, the man
* STEVIE, a friend and occasional supplier of strong drink to the
Diary, was telling us yesterday of his last visit, with young son, to
Kilbowie to watch Clydebank play. The ball cannoned out of play into the
terracing and caught the boy full in the face. His pain was assuaged
when a Clydebank player came over, patted his head, and asked: ''Are you
all right, wee man?''
He stopped long enough to sign an autograph before getting on with the
game. The player was Davie Cooper and this small incident, as much as
his legendary skill, is the measure of the man.
Rupert's lucky escape
* WE were discussing current affairs yesterday with our Glasgow black
hack driver. We expressed some sympathy for the plight of Rupert
Pennant-Rea, the deputy-governor of the Bank of England now down the
road for his amorous episodes on the governor's carpet.
''I wouldnae worry aboot him. He'll no' be hanging around Springburn
buroo wi' his P45 and a wee lassie shouting at him 'Rupert Pennant-Rea,
box nine' and then asking him 'What were the exact circumstances of your
dismissal from your last job?'''
Daze of the week
EXTRACT from the rules for the Hennessy awards for up-and-coming Irish
writers: ''To be eligible for consideration, stories and poems must
first be chosen for publication in New Irish Writing, which appears on
the first Sunday of every Monday in the Sunday Tribune.'' Unless, of
course, the Monday falls on a Tuesday.
