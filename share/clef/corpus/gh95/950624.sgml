South Africa,
PIERRE Berbezier summed it all up rather nicely after the third and
fourth place play off at Loftus. ''The Southern Hemisphere teams are
contesting the final,'' he said, ''and the Northern Hemisphere teams are
not. It is that simple.''
Now the Murdoch bombshell has hit and we in the North know that New
Zealand, South Africa, and Australia will be honing their skills even
further in regular competition and the gap will get even bigger between
us and them. And maybe it is that simple.
England have looked so dreadfully limited in everything that they have
done here in South Africa. Turgid, frankly.
We, the Sots, huffed and puffed but, in the cold light of day, never
got past the quarter finals. Ireland and Wales were inept. Only France,
who came so close to beating South Africa, and I think deserved to do
so, have hoisted our flag with any pride and dash.
So what's happened. Can I just explain my own personal experiences of
this country, for, like all Scots, I am an insular sod, and what I've
seen here has opened my eyes to what we need to do. I am more convinced
than ever that unless we do something drastic we are Christmas crackered
on the world stage. The Five Nations championship, for all its glory,
isn't exactly of the highest level. As one guy asked me in the stand at
half-time during the England France game. ''Do you people really have to
watch this every year?''
First, the basics. I am writing this on Willie Henderson's verandah in
Jo'burg. Willie played for Allan Glen's and Glasgow Accies and he came
out here eight years ago. Some of you will know Willie. This is
midwinter. We jogged at seven this morning in sunshine. I went up at
eight and played touch rugby with Jock Hobbs, the ex-All Blacks captain,
and his mates on a superbly dry pitch with short, forgiving, and bouncy
grass before the All Black press conference. The sun shone. You would
have to be a real monkey not to want to run about and get skills in
this.
It's now mid afternoon, the temperature is in the seventies, the sky
is clear blue, and I've been to the South African press conference where
I spoke to Francois Pienaar and saw Mark Andrews. These are huge,
bronzed, muscled, fit and skilful rugby players. To be fair, even at my
fittest I never looked like that.
They aren't like any of the boys playing for Scotland at the moment.
Or England. To look like them you would have to live here -- or New
Zealand, or Australia. I say again that this is midwinter.
The weather is all-important, and we know it. OK, so our A team beat
the second string Springboks at Melrose in the mud and rain, but, look,
if we want rugby to grow and compete with other sports then why should
we take glory in playing rugby in such dreadful conditions?
New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, and, yes, France, all try to
play open, running, exciting, attacking rugby. England don't. They never
have done, but what they play, with wing forwards breenging ahead, has
seen them win. Win in the mud and the wind and the rain.
You've guessed it I suppose. If you were sitting beside me now you'd
know that we in the north have to play summer rugby if we are to keep
up. New Zealand won the World Cup in 1987, Australia in 1991, and
another Southern team will today. We can trot merrily along winning the
odd Lions tour, but I think they will be a thing of the past soon. Just
like professional rugby, I think things will change.
The second thing that strikes me comes when I see the New Zealanders
and South Africans operate at close quarters. There's a certain desire
to win, and there is a level of support for that desire from everyone
involved in their countries -- never mind their sports -- that we just
don't have.
If you ever get the chance in life, get yourself down to a New Zealand
or South African training session. I was told by someone the other day
that a Scottish training session was more impressive than an All Black
one he had seen. Well, my friend, you aren't looking at the right bits.
Look at the size and physical development of the Southern Hemisphere
boys. Look at the competition they have in training.
Forget how well they do their practices or how neat and tidy they are.
Look instead at how naturally they pass and run. Look at them as rugby
players. We know as much as they do, but we have never created the same
raw material. Our players don't stack up to theirs.
Lastly, I will never forget that the whole of the Sports Institute for
South Africa, in Cape Town, was built with money that was donated by
companies. Seven willing companies chipped in about #10m in total. Would
that happen here?

THE Rugby World Cup final today in the Afrikaaner citadel of Ellis
Park represents a confrontation between the traditional foes of Southern
Hemisphere rugby.
For a Southern Hemisphere audience the battle royal in prospect could
not have been better scripted. When that old Kiwi warhorse, Colin Meads,
was asked what the meeting of the two sub-equatorial titans meant to
him, he replied with one word: Revenge.
The All Black manager played in the final two Tests in the 1970 series
which the New Zealanders lost 3-1 and in both of these Tests Pinetree
was on the losing side.
Traditionally, there has been no love lost between the Springboks and
the All Blacks (the 41-game series stands at 20 wins to South Africa, 18
to New Zealand, with three drawn) and, during the run-in to today's
game, that old animosity has been to the fore once again.
This week the Kiwis were incensed at the ludicrous Shell South Africa
offer to donate near enough #1000 to the South African Rugby Football
Union's development fund for every successful tackle on their one-man
panzer division, Jonah Lomu.
They were even more angry when the plan received the official backing
of SARFU. The fact that it has been hastily withdrawn amid a flurry of
corporate embarrassment has done nothing to ease the simmering
resentment within the Kiwi camp. If there was not needle before, there
is now.
Today's encounter has the potential to be an epic.
Springbok manager Morne de Plessis is undoubtedly right when he said
that the slogan, one team one nation, was more than just mere words.
Chester Williams may be the only black man in the side but, on the
evidence of all neutral observers these past four weeks, there is no
doubt that the entire nation -- black, white, and all hues in between --
are hoping, willing, praying that the Springboks can achieve the
impossible dream and lift the William Webb Ellis trophy at their first
attempt.
In strict rugby terms, and again on the evidence of the past four
weeks, they are not as good, not as complete a side as the New
Zealanders.
The All Black performances in the later stages of the tournament --
against Scotland and England, and particularly the 45-29 demolition of
England -- were awesome to behold.
They have been the team of the tournament and, in Jonah Lomu, they
have the player of the tournament.
No matter how the All Blacks protest at accusations that they are a
one-man band -- and they do, vociferously -- there is no gainsaying the
fact that the performance of the 20-year old New Zealander of Tongan
descent will most probably decide the issue.
Of course, the New Zealanders are not a one-trick pony, and they are
right to protest. How could any side which contains the cussed Sean
Fitzpatrick, the supremely gifted Zinzan Brooke, the mercurial talents
of newcomers Andrew Mehrtens and Glen Osborne, and the tried and tested
midfield duo of Bunce and Ellis be dismissed as a one-man show?
Lomu may be a freak, a phenomenon and the most deadly finisher the
game has ever seen, but even he is impotent unless his team-mates supply
him with the ball. And that is exactly what they have been doing these
past four weeks.
James Small is the Springbok who has the weight of an entire nation on
shoulders today. If the courageous, aggressive, but often indisciplined,
Small can halt the Tongan then South Africa are in there with a big
shout.
Lomu aside, the confrontation up front, as always, is where it begins
and ends.
The front rows are evenly matched, but the Springboks are undoubtedly
weakened by the departure through indiscipline of James Dalton. The
lineout tussle should go in the All Blacks' favour but it is at the tail
that Springbok coach Kitch Christie has played his ace card.
He has staked, if not his reputation then certainly a large chunk of
it, on the wisdom of playing an out-of-position lock, Mark Andrews, at
No.8 in order to increase his options there.
On the All Black side, Josh Kronfeld -- who for the purists is the
player of the tournament -- brings to the back row that flairing pace
which Pienaar, Kruger, and Andrews may find difficult to match in terms
of being first to the breakdown.
The All Black half-back partnership of Graeme Bachop, whose last Test
this will be, and Andrew Mehrtens has worked like a dream and Christie
has made no secret of the fact that this is an area in which he intends
his Springboks to exert maximum pressure.
In the threequarters, most observers would agree that the All Blacks
shade it.
But then there is Lomu. Today at Ellis Park, in front of their rightly
revered president Nelson Mandela, the Springboks would die for the cause
and James Small may have to come close.

BARCLAY Howard led the rise of the cream to the top as the Claremont
Scottish Mid Amateur Championship reached its quarter-final stage in
blazing sunshine at Irvine yesterday.
The 42-year-old, who joined fellow caps Wilson Bryson and Craig Watson
in the last eight, had a bye in the second round but showed no rustiness
in the afternoon, brushing aside Glencorse's Peter Lamb.
Last year's Scottish order of merit winner covered the 12 holes in
five under par, and revealed a strict practice regime over the past few
weeks has paid off. ''Every morning recently I've been down at the
practice ground at Cochrane Castle at six o'clock and stayed until 10
because I've got the place to myself,'' he said.
Today, Howard meets Borders champion Mike Thomson, who birdied three
of the first four holes against Selkirk's Donald Ballantyne. Results:

EUROPEAN MASTERS
ALISON Nicholas was on target for a second victory of the month when
she completed a six-under-par 66 to share the first-round lead with
Federica Dassu from Italy in the 54-hole European Masters at Cleydael in
Antwerp yesterday.
They lead by three strokes from Karine Espinasse with Cathy
Panton-Lewis, 40 last week, best of the Scots on 73 despite dropping
three shots over the last three holes.
Earlier this month Nicholas, four years without a win in Europe,
completed a first LPGA victory in the Corning Classic and arrived in
Belgium after taking a week off during which she worked with her coach,
Lawrence Farmer.
Yesterday she gathered five birdies and an eagle after starting her
round from the tenth tee. At the eighteenth she chipped in from 20 feet
for a birdie to be out in 33, then eagled the long first hole.
There Nicholas again did not use her putter. From 122 yards into the
wind she holed a No.7-iron approach but three-putted the next before
making two more birdies at the third and sixth holes to come home in 33.
Dassu, coach to the Italian amateur team, also had an eagle. She holed
from 25 feet for a 3 at the long sixth and rolled in putts ranging from
15 to 30 feet for her four birdies. Leading scores (British or Irish
unless stated):
66 -- F Dassu (Italy), A Nicholas.
69 -- K Espinasse (France).
70 -- R Hetherington (Australia), J Morley.
71 -- S Gustafson (Sweden), F Fehlauer (Germany), L Fairclough, K
Davies, M Landehag (Sweden), C Hall, S Prosser, K Orum (Denmark), S
Waugh (Australia), F Pike.
72 -- W Doolan (Australia), M Bertilskold (Sweden), A Brighouse, M
Hageman (Holland), L Tadiotto (Belgium), K Webb (Australia), M Koch
(Germany), E Orley (Switzerland), C Sorenstam (Sweden).
Other Scottish scores: 73 -- C Panton-Lewis. 74 -- J Forbes. 76 -- D
Reid. 77 -- L Irvine, G Stewart. 79 -- T Craik. 81 -- M McKinlay.

NEW Zealander Greg Turner leap-frogged into top spot on four under par
at the Peugeot French Open in Paris yesterday -- and then realised it
had spoiled his plans for today.
With Midlander Paul Broadhurst, the first day pacesetter, having a 9
at the long eighteenth in a round of 75, Turner's second successive 70
means he takes a one-stroke over Italian Costantino Rocca.
But it also means he cannot watch the All Blacks play South Africa in
the final of the Rugby World Cup. ''I'll have to have some score reports
brought to me on the course. My caddie is South African and I've told
him that if we lose he's sacked,'' said the 32-year-old.
Turner describes playing the last four holes as ''like tip-toeing
through a minefield with hobnail boots on''. But it was Broadhurst and
Ulsterman Ronan Rafferty on whom Le Golf National exploded.
Broadhurst was three clear standing on the eighteenth tee -- his ninth
of the day -- but hooked into the lake, missed the green with his fourth
shot, then chipped back into the water. Rafferty had led at four under
with five to play but then had four 6s.
Broadhurst now shares third spot with Glasgow's Adam Hunter, Kent's
Jamie Spence, and Cheshire's Neal Briggs. Sandy Lyle also shot 69 and at
level par is four off the pace.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
140 -- G Turner (New Zealand) 70, 70.
141 -- C Rocca (Italy) 69, 72.
142 -- N Briggs 73, 69; J Spence 71, 71; P Broadhurst 67, 75; A Hunter
69, 73.
143 -- P Affleck 72, 71; J Rivero (Spain) 72, 71.
144 -- W Riley (Australia) 72, 72; R McFarlane 72, 72; P Golding 71,
73; J Lomas 71, 73; P Haugsrud (Norway) 73, 71; S Lyle 75, 69; A
Sorensen (Denmark) 68, 76; D J Russell 73, 71.
145 -- O Karlsson (Sweden) 74, 71; T Planchin (Sweden) 72, 73; P Fulke
(Sweden) 69, 76; F Nobilo (New Zealand) 72, 73; D Williams 73, 72; L
White 69, 76; P O'Malley (Australia) 72, 73.
Other scores included: 146 -- R Rafferty 72, 74. 148 -- J M Olazabal
(Spain) 69, 79. 149 -- P Lawrie 77, 72; S McAllister 76, 73. 150 -- G

Non-qualifiers included: 151 -- M Miller 79, 72. 154 -- R Drummond 77,

SUNDERLAND MASTERS
FOR the second successive week an English raider prised a Tartan Tour
event from the grasp of a home-based player at Gleddoch yesterday in the
Sunderland of Scotland Masters. Bolton's Michael Jones took the title by
a single stroke.
The 28-year-old, who represented the North-West Region in Tuesday's
PGA Challenge, equalled the day-old course record in the the third round
with a nine-under-par 63 and closed with a 68 to deny local assistant
Stephen Thompson and countryman Richard Walker of Wearside.
With temperatures in the 80s, Jones holed a four-foot birdie putt on
the final green for a fraught victory having lost a ball at the
fifteenth.
Leading scores:
271 -- M Jones (Bolton Golf Teaching Centre) 72, 68, 63, 68.
272 -- R Walker (Wearside) 67, 71, 66, 68; S Thompson (Gleddoch) 70,
69, 67, 66.
273 -- P Smith (Deeside) 69, 66, 69, 69; L Vannet (Carnoustie) 68, 71,
68; 66.
274 -- S Martin (North Engineering) 70, 67, 73, 64; C Gillies
(Falkirk) 67, 73, 66, 68; K Stables (Montrose) 74, 68, 68, 64.
275 -- S Russell (Hilton Park) 74, 63, 67, 71; K Campbell
(Machrihanish) 70, 69, 67, 69; R Arnott (Caddy Shack) 72, 68, 67, 68.

SALT Lake looks the value bet for the Ladbroke Handicap at Ascot. He
just failed to give Holtye half-a-stone at Newbury in a fast run race
and on that form he should hold Burooj on a line through Embankment, who
was a distant third.
Zajko scored on the same day at Newbury but was all out at the finish
and may not get the extra quarter-mile today.
Virtual Reality took second place in the Zetland Gold Cup, with Burooj
back in third, but the timing of that race suggests he will not hold the
selection if there is a true pace.
A bigger danger could be Khayrapour, who won handsomely last time out,
being eased down when five lengths clear. He has never run in this class
before but has each-way claims at his current odds.
Most of the fillies in the opening race met in the Masaka Stakes and
Cask, who took third place behind Subya that day, can prove the best
among them again. Mandarina ran into traffic problems that day but did
not show improvement when beaten again by Subya next time out. Royal
Rebuke has run two fast races but last time out did not look as if she
would relish today's extra furlong.
Don Pepe can land Ayr's main race, the Rothmans Handicap. Having
beaten a couple of big fields at the end of last season, the selection
has progressed well and finished strongly to win over today's course and
distance earlier this month, with Al Wujud in third.
Although that rival has won since, that only serves to confirm the
form and Don Pepe should again prove superior on 5lb better terms.
The following race should go to bottom-weight Keep Battling, seeking
his third win at Ayr this season. He has run well in defeat recently and
should be suited by the return to 10 furlongs.
Best bet on the card may be the improving Surprise Mission. From
in-form Richard Whittaker's stable, he can take his third win off the
reel in the Alloway Handicap.

SCOTTISH Pride's stockbroker has conducted a review of dealings in the
company shares and uncovered one instance where a prospective purchaser
was wrongly told that shares were not available.
Lord Sanderson of Bowden, Scottish Pride chairman, said at Ingliston
yesterday that the mistake was due to human error and had now been
rectified. The purchaser had been allocated shares at the price of 38p
which applied when the order was first lodged.
The shares have since risen to more than 50p and the stockbrokers are
meeting the cost of rectifying their mistake.
Complaints of difficulty in acquiring shares had been made by a
shareholders group but these have not been borne out by inquiries made
by the stockbrokers.
Lord Sanderson has asked Michael McReath, secretary of the
shareholders' association to come forward with any further information
he may have on the matter. He added that he was prepared, if necessary
to have an independent inquiry.
''We inherited Allied Provincial as our stockbrokers from the old
Scottish Milk Marketing Board and have no special allegiance to them,''
he said. ''The board of Scottish Pride will have to consider all these
matters at the appropriate moment.''
He said he was concerned at anything which had an unsettling effect on
shareholders. ''The more people are unsettled, the more a shareholders
group can complain and criticise and the more difficult it becomes for
us to manage the business.''
David Henderson, a director of the stockbroking firm Allied Provincial
Parsons Penney in their Glasgow office, said he could not comment on
their future relationship with Scottish Pride.
''What happened was a most unfortunate incident,'' he said. ''We have
been whiter than white in all our dealings with Scottish Pride. We have
gone out of our way to be extremely helpful and tried to make sure fair
play was done.''
In one case, he said, there had been a purely human error. ''Someone
forgot to put something in the book and the person involved is extremely
upset. The mistake was acknowledged and rectified immediately it was
brought to our attention. The only person who is out of pocket is
ourselves.''
Lord Sanderson said that he had already had one meeting with
representatives of the shareholders' association and would be meeting
them again.
There had been concerns about the future of some of the company's
creameries and he repeated his assurance that the island creameries
remained a central part of the company's business.
The company had spent a lot of money on restructuring, he said, and
they were on the way to making Scottish Pride a very good business. ''I
am confident that there is a market out there for good cheese if it is
properly marketed and sold,'' he said.
He gave an assurance that Scottish Pride, formerly the manufacturing
and retailing arm of the Milk Marketing Board, was keen to retain a good
relationship with Scottish Milk -- its major suppliers.
''We were spawned out of them and we owe them the chance to sell us
their product -- but we are telling them quite clearly what we as
customers want, particularly in relation to the protein content of milk
that goes for cheese.''

<TEXT>
THIS week's Brussels agreement on conditions for animal transport
which will apply throughout the EC was hailed yesterday by Scottish
Office agriculture minister, Sir Hector Monro, as a substantial step
forward.
He promised that there would be detailed discussion with the farming,
road transport and slaughterhouse interests over the next two years on
the way in which the framework agreed in Brussels would be translated
into UK legislation.
It would cost the industry more in preparing vehicles to comply with
the new standard, he admitted, during a visit to the show.
There would also be additional transport costs, partly because of
reduced stocking densities, but it was a step which had to be taken in
the light of public interest in animal welfare.
While the number of hours applying to journeys cannot be varied by
national legislation it is understood that there may be room for some
variation to take account of local circumstances. In the Scottish
context that would apply to some of the ''awkward'' situations which
could arise over transporting animals in from some of the Scottish
islands to the mainland.
Basically, if animals remain on a float during the sea journey that
would be counted as part of the journey time and the hours limits would
apply. If livestock are transported in pens, with access to food and
water the sea journey may be regarded as a rest period.
Officials regard the agreement as a vast improvement on the present
situation where there is no common set of rules.

NEWS that tree planting is to be allowed on set-aside land has been
welcomed by Sir Peter Hutchison, Forestry Commission chairman.
The new ruling means that farmers will be able to count eligible
arable land entered for the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland
Premium Scheme towards obligations under the Arable Area Payment Scheme.
''I am pleased that the EC have now accepted the UK Government's view
that woodlands and other forms of environmental improvement are a
sensible way to manage land in set aside,'' said Sir Peter.
Woodland awards
A WOODLAND on the outskirts of Livingston has received a major award.
Linhouse, owned by Lothian Regional Council, received the Hunter Blair
Trophy for woodlands of 10-150 hectares under the Scottish Woods and
Forest Awards.
Through reclamation of abandoned industrial land the woodland provides
access for pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders and will eventually be
integrated with the nearby Almondell and Calderwood Country Park.
Presenting the awards, the Duke of Buccleuch said: ''The entries for
this competition are an example of what is best in forestry, combining
conservation and public access with timber production potential.''
The John Kennedy Award for 150-plus hectares went to Belladrum Wood,
near Inverness, and the Alistair Lilburn Trophy for farm woodland went
to John Strachan, Tullo Farm, Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire.

UNION leaders claimed yesterday that the Health &amp; Safety Executive was
cutting back on the numbers of safety inspectors visiting farms at the
same time as it was launching a major campaign against tractor
accidents.
Barry Leathwood, national secretary of the agricultural sector of the
Transport &amp; General Workers' Union, said he feared that over the next
two years the number of farm safety inspectors in the UK would fall from
180 to 75.
He expressed concern that such cuts were being imposed on what was the
second-most dangerous industry in the country. ''If you take
stress-related suicides into account we are the most dangerous
industry,'' he said.
David Mattey, the HSE's field operations director for Scotland, denied
that the number of inspectors would be reduced to the levels described
by Mr Leathwood. A lot of people had left the service on a retiral deal
but there was also a recruitment programme.
The inspection system had been changed in recent years, he said, so
that more frequent visits were paid to farms considered to be high risk.
The HSE is launching a new training video aimed at highlighting
incidence of tractor accidents and how they can be avoided. Over the
past five years there have been more than 80 such accidents in Scotland,
including seven fatalities.
Alistair Bruce from Broughton, near Biggar, attended yesterday's
launch in a wheelchair. He has had to give up farming.
He described how his tractor ''ran away'' from him as he drove down a
slope. He was thrown clear but had to spend six months in hospital with
spinal injuries. ''People need to be made aware of the simple things
that can go wrong,'' he said.
''I am sure that 60% of the people watching the video would see things
that they had done themselves.''
Scotland had the highest number of farm employee tractor accidents in
Britain over the past five years. That is partly because of the size of
the farming industry in the country, combined with difficult terrain,
inclement weather and dark winters.
Ivan Monckton, of the TGWU and a member of the HSE's agricultural
industry committee, also expressed the fear that a reduction in the
number of HSE inspectors would lead to a lowering of safety standards.
''One of the greatest deterrents is the fact that an inspector might
call,'' he said.
''We are not criticising the HSE initiative and we are glad to support
this launch but we think they need more resources.''
The HSE video will be targeted initially at agricultural students. The
main reason for people not following basic safety principles is believed
to be lack of adequate information and training.

CHELSEA took it upon themselves to prove that top-class players can be
bought without breaking the bank and in Ruud Gullit and Mark Hughes the
London club have acquired a potentially formidable duo.
Hughes, whose #1.5m departure from Old Trafford along with Paul Ince's
#7m transfer to Inter-Milan, clears the way and provides the finance for
United to move for Barcelona's unsettled striker Hristo Stoichkov.
The Bulgarian helped destroy United's European dream last season with
a brilliant display in Barcelona's 4-0 Champions' League win in the Nou
Camp.
United manager Alex Ferguson will have to move quickly to appease the
fans, many of whom feel the way Ince and Hughes have been moved on has
caused a dip in morale within the squad.
After a week in which the other London powers, Tottenham and Arsenal,
paid out #12m between them on strikers, Chelsea's moves are welcome.
Manager Glenn Hoddle first introduced Gullit and then announced news of
Hughes' arrival.
Gullit, now 32, will sign on as a free transfer from Sampdoria on July
1 and will receive a reported #1.6m over two years while Hughes, at 31,
was thought to have signed a new contract at Old Trafford, but -- to
everyone's surprise -- his name was circulated on a list of available
players. Hoddle moved in and struck a three-year deal with the Welshman.
''Over the past 10 years, Hughes has probably been the best striker of
his type,'' said Hoddle.
While he was celebrating, Celtic were dismayed to learn that Dimitri
Radchenko had signed for John Toshack's Deportivo La Coruna for #1.9m,
which is a good deal short of the money the premier division side had
offered Racing Santander.
Also, Aberdeen chairman Ian Donald yesterday denied reports that Theo
Snelders is set to join Celtic. He insisted: ''There has been no contact
with Celtic. It is obviously the silly season.''
Rangers still believe they will sign Romanian World Cup star Florin
Raducioiu even though he has gone on holiday saying he doesn't want to
move from Espanol whose chairman Francesco Pellor is reported to have
said: ''It is now offical. Florin will play for us next season.''
Stuart Ayton will make his debut tomorrow for Partick Thistle in their
opening Inter-Toto tie in Austria against Linzer.
Manager John Lambie said: ''He is one for the future. He has an eye
for a chance and scored a number of goals last season in the reserves.''
Livingston, formerly known as Meadowbank, will still have to play
their home matches at Meadowbank until September or October because
their new stadium will not be ready until then.
Graeme Souness has made a #500,000 bid to make Coventry midfielder
Mike Marsh his first signing for new club Galatasaray.

IF you have been buying plants you will have ended up with containers
of all shapes, sizes and purposes.
Half pots. Round pots. Square pots. Deep pots. Dozens of them. Plastic
of course. Clay ones seem to have been ousted some time ago.
There are segmented unit trays made of polystyrene, which are very
convenient in the way the plants can be pushed out complete with roots,
and section trays beloved by bedding plant producers.
In Europe and the USA, most plants are sold as units with their own
roots, in a segment or an individual pot, and there are the trays for
holding a number of pot plants, used by growers marketing their produce.
Apparently there is some concern about the disposal of all these
plastic items. They don't break down biologically, which is what worries
the environmentalists.
Some companies do have a disposal system. Perhaps we should have pot
banks, like glass and waste paper banks.
When was the last time you got a wooden fish box or seed tray? They
used to be the in thing. There used to be a great argument also about
the effectiveness of clay pots against plastic ones. The former ones
breathe and the others don't, so they say.
They both work. It seems that plants are as adaptable as gardeners.

IT'S an optical instrument. It's also a type of circular prison where
inmates can be observed -- from a central vantage point -- at all times.
Panopticon. Third Estate Music and Dance make good use of both
applications.
Panopticon is about ways of watching. Most immediately it's about
control and surveillance, but it also makes useful points about
audiences and performers -- how we watch is just as important as why we
watch. Here there are several angles to the act of watching/being
watched.
For almost the entire time, we are on the other side of the fence from
the performers. The space has been turned into a kind of alien
playground, full of security fencing and metal cages. Viewing is either
directly, through a mesh of wire, or indirectly on one of several
screens. There's even a caged monitor suspended above a pool, so that
only a reflection of the film image can be seen. Sometimes the screened
images are pre-recorded, sometimes they show what's happening
(simultaneously) in a nearby ante-room, and sometimes they feed back the
here and now of the performance itself. This mix of actualities -- live
dancers, thrashing inside a tiny two-tiered cage against projected
close-ups of their own, or others' movements -- builds up into a
fascinating study of what a portentous voice declares is ''A prison
without bars.''
With such all pervasive, intrusive, relentless monitoring, everyone is
under surveillance. But how utterly disquieting to find that silent,
grainy footage of a close-grappling duet looks sinister, even violent on
the screen when glancing over one's shoulder reveals the truth: double
work of an athleticism that requires and is given support and trust. For
that image alone Third Estate are to be congratulated, but indeed the
whole piece is sharp and confrontational with strong ideas that could
surely benefit from a fuller exploration.

<TEXT>
THE Non-Domestic (Unoccupied Property) (Scotland) Regulations, 1995,
issued under the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1994, came into force
on April 1, 1995. I wish to draw attention to the hardship caused by
this Act to impose rates payable at 50% of rateable value.
If an owner of unoccupied property has received no income, some for as
long as two years, where is this money to come from?
There are thousands of empty shops and offices throughout the city,
empty not through choice but due to many circumstances -- opening of
supermarkets in the area, redevelopment, movement of population to new
areas, or general diminution of trading due to recession.
In any given row of shops there are invariably one or more empty, to
let or for sale. This is not caused by owners demanding high rents. Some
have reduced rent by as much as 50% with still no hope of new tenants,
and with the imposition of new rates properties no longer have any
value.
I do not refer to large property owners but to private individuals who
now find their only source of income has gone and their assets have now
become a liability.
On top of this, recent revaluation notices show an increase of
rateable value by as much as 35%, and owners are expected to pay rates
on the increased figure. Though there are means available for appeal,
these will not be considered till September 1995.
This new tax will be the death knell of thousands of small shopkeepers
who for generations have served the local communities in their areas.
The editorial, Finger on the pulse (Scotland's Business, June 1), says
it all. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce is united in its condemnation of the
Act.
In addition to having no income from their property, owners still have
to pay for common charges and repairs which on older properties can be
horrendous. Insurance premiums must also be met.
Owners would naturally prefer to receive rent and pay tax rather than
be confronted with this no-win situation where their property is lying
empty and derelict.

READING the letter about jobs paying #2.50 an hour (June 15), I would
like to ask your correspondent who defends low pay how he thinks that
#2.50 an hour will pay bills, food, and still be able to provide some
modest pleasure, the cinema or a football match?
The combination of very low-paid jobs, less than Social Security, and
the UK state lottery is lethal. In an effort to escape from low-paid
jobs people may look to the lottery.
I would like to ask those critics of the lottery to tackle the causes
of why people spend more than they should. One reason undoubtedly is the
very high number of low-paid jobs.

MR BLAIR, Labour's leader, has enjoyed such a run of good luck that it
is something of a novelty to record a setback, but that is what the
outcome of the election for the head of the Transport and General
Workers' amounts to. It is no secret that Mr Blair would have preferred
the challenger, Jack Dromey, to have beaten the incumbent General
Secretary, Bill Morris. Instead Mr Morris steamed home with a very large
majority on a poll which attracted one-third of the membership of the
country's largest union. Whereas Mr Dromey, who is personally close to
Blair, is a moderniser in the Labour leader's mould, Mr Morris
represents the old traditional T &amp; G (though he is thoroughly modern in
supporting the rights of women at work). Mr Dromey's specific argument
was that the union was declining in membership and would certainly
continue to do so unless it altered its traditional stance. Membership
has indeed fallen at the T &amp; G but its fate is shared by nearly all
British unions, and particularly the largest ones with their roots in
old industries: the 1980s were an unfortunate decade for British unions.
The present membership obviously has not blamed Mr Morris for that
general trend as it affected its union.
Mr Morris has proved to be an opponent of some of Mr Blair's main
policies. He vigorously fought to retain Clause Four which committed
Labour to public ownership, but that was an emotional, a symbolic, issue
-- much more immediate significance is attached to the question of a
national minimum wage. Here Mr Blair's endorsement of the principle has
been brushed aside by Mr Morris's insistence on the need to adopt a
specific figure. The one he is insisting on is at the top end of any
likely range and as such is thought by Mr Blair to give an unnecessary
hostage to fortune. The real importance of the tension between the two
men lies in the range of the T &amp; G as well as its size, and its
implication for the future in the event of a Labour government. The
union is far more general than transport, being involved in almost every
aspect of industrial life. It is also represented in most of Labour's
constituency organisations and enjoys substantial clout within the TUC.
The union was famous in the past for the support it provided almost
automatically to the Labour leadership. When that position ended during
the Wilson era, the difficulties the party (and Mr Wilson's Government)
faced were immensely increased. Had Mr Dromey been elected yesterday,
the old intimate relationship the Attlee administration enjoyed with the
T &amp; G would have been restored. What is likely to obtain now will be
much more tense.

THE image of the medieval battlefield gives me the heebie-jeebies.
Imagine being selected for the Scottish forward line at Bannockburn,
hanging on to your trusty pike as the English cavalry thunders towards
you, a 10-foot high tidal wave of horse muscle and heavy metal. Scary,
eh?
Mouths dry, stomachs heaving, the foot soldiers standing
shoulder-to-shoulder in their schiltroms could only watch, pray, and
await the inevitable collision as the war horses, travelling at perhaps
25mph, hurtled head-long into the porcupine of pikes.
With the horsemen 100 yards away the ground would begin to shiver, the
pikemen might be able to make out the heraldic devices on the shields,
the explosion of colour from the flapping surcoats of horses and riders,
the sun glinting off their helmets, plumes flowing in the breeze. Fifty
yards away and they might make out the rattle of the armour, the
pounding hooves and the shriek of battle cries. The man next to you
moans quietly and braces himself against his pike, anchored in the
ground behind. Now you could see the wild eyes of the horses beneath
their visors, the glinting tips of the lances. Seconds later amid the
deafening metallic impact hell on earth would be visited on the
combatants.
Here on Papa Westray we have a Highland garron called Rhu (Greenburn
Harvest Moon, if you want its Sunday name). He's getting on in years and
is a gentle soul. However, when he's at the bottom of our 10-acre field
and sensing Katy arriving at Johnny Hourston's slap with a turnip
delivery, he comes chasing up the brae from the loch, mane streaming in
the wind. Half a ton of hurtling horse flesh does the nerves no good at
all, I can tell you. Imagine then a wall of Clydesdales or Shire horses,
kitted up with full body armour, heading your way and you with nowhere
to run.
Unnerving though this scenario might be, the truth is that once you've
read a description of one medieval battle -- deadly showers of arrows,
the cavalry charge, the bloody hand-to-hand fighting -- you have, by and
large, read them all. Into the renaissance period the chroniclers get a
bit more descriptive, the reporter's rather than the press officer's eye
is more in evidence.
Recently I came across a sideline, a piece of inconsequential but
intriguing detail relating to Mary Queen of Scot's last stand . . . the
battle of Langside on May 13, 1568.
Among the knowles and valleys of what is now Glasgow's southern
suburbs, the forces of Regent Moray and his border pikemen took the high
ground to meet Mary's vanguard 2000-strong force of Hamiltons. Near the
crest of the hill the sides closed for battle. The long pikes of the
front ranks were soon interlaced, each man fastening his spear point in
his opposite number's armoured vest and attempting to push him to the
ground.
This platform of spears, for all the world like a wooden floor,
according to one historian, soon became littered with all sorts of
debris, spears, helmets, pistols, and stones lobbed into the front line
by those immediately behind the action. For half an hour this strange
dance of death continued with hundreds of men locked together swaying to
and fro until the Regent's forces broke the line and chased Mary's men
off the hill.

* Children who are ready to overcome the perils of the playground *
Parents who, once again, face the nightmare of sports day
Julie Bertagna reports on an exhibition of student ideas that could
both improve the schoolground and put a stop to bullying
HANGING around brings out anti-social tendencies in the best of us.
You can see it in every supermarket queue. Otherwise calm, sane souls
begin to take offence at the number of tins of beans consumed by the
person in front, and at the presumed vicious nature of the individual
behind who keeps jabbing at your leg with the sharp corner of an
oversized cornflake box.
Trapped and bored in the limbo of hanging around, human nature demands
that we find something to do. Impatience makes pests of everyone and
everything. So we sulk and niggle and nitpick; that's what we do.
The same phenomenon occurs in the tarmac jungle of the school
playground. Across the country, thousands of school pupils empty out
into wastelands of boredom to fight and heckle each other through seven
hours or more of playground misery every week. (That's several hundred
hours a year and more than 3000 hours in an average school career).
Yet playground misery is somehow seen as character-forming. Children
as young as four and five are supposed to develop some vital backbone
and resourcefulness through periods of standing outside shivering in a
blank space of asphalt trying to magic up their own entertainment. Or so
the myth goes. But what most of us know from experience, and what
research also shows, is that the entertainment reaped from playground
boredom often takes the form of violence and bullying.
The pupils of Hyndland Primary School, in the upfront manner of
today's kids, decided to dump this dubious tradition of playground
limbo. They took on the task of recreating their uninspiring,
delapidated and, in places, dangerous playground. The result is a
stunning Playground Exhibition, a whole-school project that threw up a
wealth of imaginative and feasible ideas to transform the area into a
stimulating, fun place also doubling as an outdoor classroom. The
exhibition is a treasure of ideas for any school.
''There are no trees. Let's put in lots of trees,'' is the passionate
plea from one pupil in a recorded discussion for the exhibition. ''A
climbing frame. But only for primary one and only two people should be
allowed on,'' says another, staking out some infant territory. ''Tables
with flowered plastic tablecloths and a pond with a fence around it,''
another little voice longs.
The older ones have their priorities too. ''Do something about the
toilets. They are horrible and stink,'' writes Disgusted of primary
five. One young environmentalist wants ''plenty of creepy-crawlies. The
old tree stump will be their home.'' ''No more mud!'' ''Green not
grey!'' ''Trees not sore knees!'' exclaim a band of budding
slogan-writers.
The Playground Exhibition started out as a parents' initiative. They,
as well as teachers and pupils, had long been concerned at the state of
the crumbling playground which turns to mud-pools in the rain. It is
also separated into many different areas and levels which makes it
impossible to supervise adequately. A number of children have been
injured playing on it over the years.
The children were immediately enthused about a project so close to
their hearts. As the ideas kept coming, the project snowballed.
''The children know better than anyone what the problems are,'' says
Kate Philbrick, one of the parent campaigners. ''At present there are no
facilities, nothing for them to do in the playground at breaktimes. They
came up with loads of fundraising solutions, play features and
activities, along with important safety improvements such as wider steps
and ramps for prams and wheelchairs.''
As well as being the main fundraising task force, primary seven drew
up a graph of serious injuries and surveyed pupil opinion on being
outside in cold weather. They found that the hurly-burly of playground
life peaks in primary five, six and seven, as this group is particularly
accident-prone. As for the cold weather, hardy primary ones loved it but
by the time they became thin-skinned, primary-five, comfort vultures
they've grown a complete abhorrence to bracing fresh air.
A Peace Hut was the suggestion of two thoughtful primary sevens Naomi
and Cora, who briskly pointed out: ''Not all children want to run around
screaming and shouting at intervals. Some would prefer to have a quiet
area so they can read, listen to music and play board games.'' Quite.
Art you can climb on, sit on and walk on (painted areas, broken-plate
mosaic paths and junk sculptures) was a popular suggestion, with the art
being made by the pupils in co-operation with art students.
The resurgence of old games such as hopscotch and skipping, taught to
the children in gym lessons, has already brought about a minor culture
change in the playground, according to their teachers. There is also a
raised awareness of issues such as fairer deal for girls and younger
children wanting to use the football pitch -- the domain of senior boys
in most schools.
Many children wanted the option of practising basketball and netball
at breaks, and asked for playground nets and line markings. After all,
why should schools tacitly encourage -- by providing an open football
pitch -- the domination of football over all other sports? Many
children, boys included, find the aggressive, close contact of the game
just too intimidating.
A felled tree, a toy car run, a ''monster maze'' of embedded tyres,
and games painted on tarmac and walls -- these are just a few of the
easily-constructed, recycled play features thought up by the children.
Even the stones from the unsafe and soon-to-be-demolished infant annexe
are to be recycled as stepping stones across the grass and for a
gathering circle to sit in for a chat and eat playpieces. The gathering
circle, a feature of Australian schools, becomes an outdoor classroom in
fine weather -- though a ready supply of brollies might be a sensible
investment for a Scottish version.
''The project exhibition has focused everyone not just on improving
the playground but on how to use it as a valuable resource,'' says Kate
Philbrick. ''It has set everyone thinking about the playground as an
important school issue. The ideas generated have been super. Some things
we can definitely do now, some will take more time and work.''
A visit to several other tarmac jungles confirmed that the playground
is a live issue in the minds of most pupils. Here are some of their
imaginative suggestions:
''I would like football nets because if you score you will know if you
score,'' said William, aged 10, from Temple Primary in Glasgow.
On another tack altogether Carrie, eight, craves a pond with yellow
ducks. Not just any old yellow ducks though. ''I want the ducks to have
blue eyes to match my eyes.''
Livening up the drabness is the concern of Sarah, 10, and Heather,
eight, who would like a wall mural and flowers to ''put some colour
in.''
Activities to ease the boredom of long breaks were a popular priority.
''There should be games for the infants such as a sand pit,'' said
10-year-old Jennifer. Yvonne, 11, made a sensible suggestion that ''the
playground should be made flat so we can ride bikes and play on our
skates.''
Eight-year-old Maxine has a list: ''A swing and roundabout, and a
chute and a seesaw, and a nice garden.'' Gary, aged 11, from Barmulloch
Primary in the north of Glasgow, would add a soft surface ''so you don't
get a sore bump.''
Transforming dreary school sheds into an imaginative play area became
the focus of the Barmulloch primary sevens. Build a little centre in the
sheds, suggested Lisa, where you could have art and games. The idea
caught hold and they were off: ''Put in heating and a pool table,'' said
Sharon. ''Games machines,'' added Kirsty. ''Have an art gallery,'' said
Paula. ''Murals and artwork,'' said Amanda. Oh, and bike racks like
Grange Hill so you could bring in your cycles.
A tree house, tyre swings, a bouncy castle for better fun, an assault
course and a fold-up swimming pool. Anything else? ''Higher fences,''
suggested Twishaf, aged 10, from Temple Primary. Why higher? ''So the
thieves don't steal all the new things that the school bought.''

THE leading European rugby unions are to join forces to avoid being
left behind by Rupert Murdoch's $550m broadcasting deal with the major
Southern Hemisphere countries.
Vernon Pugh, immediate past chairman of the International Rugby Board
and current chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union, said a stronger Five
Nations committee would come into force later this year.
The existing four Home Unions committee, comprising England, Scotland,
Wales and Ireland, will disappear in September with Italy invited to
play a bigger role which could eventually lead to a place in the current
Five Nations' Championship.
''The idea is to end the committee of Home Unions as a separate
entity, to drive forward the Five Nations organisation and actively pull
in Italy,'' said Pugh.
Pugh, who is chairing an IRB working party on the future of amateurism
that will be discussed in Paris in August, said the deal had done the
European game an ''enormous favour.''
Murdoch's News Corporation will broker an annual Test competition
involving New Zealand, South Africa and Australia that many see as the
final nail in the amateur coffin.
The 10-year agreement will also incorporate an inter-provincial
competition involving teams from the three countries, as well as
incoming tours from northern hemisphere nations and the British Lions.
Scotland will be one of the first visiting sides to campaign in the
Southern Hemisphere under the terms of the Murdoch agreement. The Scots
are due to tour New Zealand next summer.
It is unlikely that the Scots would benefit from a deal struck with a
broadcaster by a host union, but it will be a matter of no little
interest to see how Murdoch's exclusive right to televise the games will
translate into viewing arrangements back in Scotland and the UK.
''I think the southern hemisphere have done us an enormous favour,''
said Pugh. ''They have raised the stakes. I believe it sets the market
for the value of the game in the Northern Hemisphere.
''In truth, they're being paid a significant amount of money for a
part of the world in which the viewing population is relatively small.''
The deal works out at around #36m a year -- compared to the #32m BBC
and Sky paid last year to screen the Five Nations and English club games
until 1997.
It also raises the prospect of Murdoch increasing the stakes when the
Five Nations' Championship deal is up for renewal, with the possibility
of another major occasion heading for satellite subscribers only.
Incoming Rugby Football Union secretary Tony Hallett said: ''This is
the biggest deal in history and a huge challenge for us to come up with
something. The three Southern Hemisphere nations have devised new
competitions. We have nothing new.
''The Five Nations remains the jewel in our crown and we will have to
see how we can make our domestic programme more attractive.
''This deal will certainly affect the future of TV bids in the north,
where we look threatened by three strong unions.''
The deal, announced on the eve of the World Cup final between New
Zealand and South Africa, has been described as smashing the last
vestiges of amateurism in the game. But Pugh added there were still
concerns among the 67 member unions at the increasing march of
professionalism.
''They believe if it becomes pay for play, it may be impossible for
unions and the International Board to retain control,'' said Pugh.
''Three out of the four believe it is important to retain some type of
ethos in the game and thirdly they want to retain some equality among
the players, so that the market value of a forward compares to a
half-back or another star.
''It's only New Zealand who have been pressing for a position where
players are paid to play. The others favour, and New Zealand are happy
to accept, a position where they continue to operate throught their
developing trust funds.''
Scottish Rugby Union chief executive Bill Hogg said: ''Our position,
which is the one we will be putting forward when the IB meets in August,
is that we want the game to remain amateur but with a relaxation on what
the players can receive for off-field activities.
''Perhaps, also, we might reach a situation where players receive full
re-imbursement for money lost through playing the game. Nobody wants to
see players suffer financially because they are playing the game.
''In Scotland most of our international players already have good jobs
and they would not be able to become fully professional players because
of their careers.''
But Irish RFU president Ken Reid warned that the deal pushed the sport
further down the road to professionalism. ''When we were in South Africa
these past few weeks, it was clear that payment was being made to
certain players and it is hardly a coincidence that this deal was
announced the day before the World Cup final,'' said Reid.
Hallett added: ''This sort of deal will drive a hole through
amateurism. We must redefine the boundaries of professionalism. This
sort of money and the concentration of playing will prevent a player
sustaining a job and I think he will need support from these amounts of
money.''

THE real commercial area of the Highland Show, despite the glamour of
the livestock sections, lies in the avenues of machinery.
The opening two days are the ones when commercial decisions are made
and prices are discussed. The Highland has a long reputation for being
an event where dealers do sell new machines. This year's show has lived
up to all expectations.
Tractor size is increasing rapidly as Keith Clayphan of John Deere
explained: ''We used to work on the assumption that horsepower increased
by 0.75hp each year, but that has changed. Eighteen months ago the
average for tractors sold in the UK was 94hp -- today it's 100hp.''
Despite the keen demand for tractors, manufacturers are facing serious
problems. Mr Clayphan said: ''The tractor market throughout the world is
on the up. Britain was first but the rest of Europe is buying as well as
North and South America. Sales in France have jumped by 20% and that
market is double the UK's. At the same time we are having problems in
getting steel and tyres while many of our component suppliers just
cannot keep us going.''
Massey-Ferguson had plenty to smile about clinching a deal with a
Borders farming company which has purchased a new combine with a price
tag of #186,000. The same stand also sold a new tractor for #65,000.
Dairy cattle in limelight
DOWN among the livestock it was the turn of the dairy cattle to be in
the limelight. The stand was extremely high, according to most ringside
observers.
The Holstein Friesian classes were watched by many of the delegates to
the society's European conference and one Dutch visitor commented:
''These cattle are every bit as good as anything in Europe and in some
cases even better.''
The championship went to the six-year-old Adamdale Starbuck Mag from
John Loftus, Preese Hall, Kirkham, Preston. This cow, from a herd of
140, calved six weeks ago and in her last lactation gave 11,000 litres.
In the Ayrshire ring the top award went to one of the breed's
best-known herds for the first time since 1979 -- that of Ian Gilmour &amp;
Sons Humeston, Maybole. Their winner was the five-year-old cow Humeston
Lady Maud 42nd which calved on Saturday. She gave 7000 litres in her
last lactation.
The Jersey championship and reserve went to the 200 strong herd of
Robert Graham from Airthrey Carse, Stirling. His winner was the
six-year-old Isla Counts Barbara RR which is currently giving 28 litres
per day.
In the sheep rings a huge entry of Texels eventually saw one of the
breed's most dedicated enthusiasts, Robin Hope, Newfield, Dumfries, take
the championship with a ewe. Near-neighbours Douganhill Farms, Castle
Douglas, stood reserve with a ewe lamb.

James Shaw Grant argues that it is time for Scotland to come of age,
shake off the hang ups of centuries, and press for a positive, living
memorial to Highland traditions in a new, hi-tech University of the
Highlands
EXORCISM is not normally one of the functions of government but there
are fleeting moments when it is both possible and expedient that it
should be. Our lives are largely driven by ghosts: often from a distant
past. The dance of the demons in Bosnia is an extreme and bloody
manifestation of a very common phenomenon. Our own ghosts are gentler,
less obvious, but they are just as tenacious. More dangerous, perhaps,
because we forget they are there.
The current campaign to remove the statue of the Duke of Sutherland
from his Highland hilltop is a good example. The destruction of statues
is an even more pointless exercise than putting them up in the first
place. Removal of the Duke from his pedestal will not obliterate the
past. It will not even alter the future. The desire to achieve it is as
irrational as the reaction of a child, kicking the stone it has tripped
on.
Although it matters little whether the Duke stays or goes, it does
matter that able, intelligent, well-meaning men and women in 1995 are
still motivated by something that happened to their ancestors -- or to
someone else's ancestors -- six generations ago.
The Clearances have done even greater damage to the Highlands as a
memory than they did as a historical fact. How often over the past 50 or
60 years have we seen a Highland community pass up an opportunity of
development because people were so obsessed by the memory of past
injustices they could not raise their eyes to current opportunities? Not
like a rabbit transfixed by a stoat, but like a rabbit transfixed by a
stoat that is no longer there.
One of the most encouraging features of the Highland situation in the
past 10 years or so has been the extent to which younger men and women
have broken through this miasma of memory to deal with the real problems
of today. I can see this more clearly than most because I know what
things were like when I became secretary of the Lewis Association 50
years ago, a member of the Crofters Commission 40 years ago, or even a
member of the Highland and Islands Development Board 25 years ago.
From that perspective, the transformation of the Highlands is almost
unbelievable. Those growing up today see how much still needs to be
done. Those of my generation are astounded that so much has been
achieved. Sixty years ago Stornoway was a dying town in a dying island.
There was little prospect of business expansion or even survival. The
limit of local enterprise was a determination to hang on to the bitter
end and go down with the sinking ship.
Today the distinction between Stornoway and rural Lewis is gone and,
compared even with the fairly recent past, the whole island is buzzing
with social, recreational, creative, and economic activity. The same
applies to Skye and most of the larger Highland communities.
To achieve this transformation, the people of the Highlands have had
to exorcise their ghosts: to realise that they could do things for
themselves instead of sitting back as helpless victims of an ancient
wrong, waiting for someone to come and deliver them. The controversy
over the Duke's statue is not a true reflection of the current Highland
mood, but it is a reminder that the addict is not easily cured. We still
have our pillars of salt.
So too with the small minority who deface the Highlands with
anti-English slogans. We are all saddened by the communities where half
the lights go out at the autumn equinox when the holiday-homers return,
like Caesars, to their winter quarters. But the great majority of
Highland people welcome those who have come to stay among us
permanently. We have been greatly enriched by the influx of talented,
friendly people who have come North in the last two decades and we know
that no community can possibly survive which is not able to assimilate
incomers.
Unfortunately the ghosts that afflict us in the Highlands are not all
Gaelic-speaking or even local. The most obdurate, the most dangerous,
haunt the corridors of St Andrew's House and Westminster. In the
official mind there is a shadowy ill-defined boundary somewhere in the
North at which, it is believed, you step out of a rational, modern
Scotland into a Highland never-never land.
Not long before I retired from the Highland board I was at a
conference in Newcastle at which an Oxbridge don propounded the theory
that development of any sort was impossible north of the Caledonian
canal. The whole area, he said, should be left to the sheep and the
sportsmen. He was mildly surprised when I told him the area he had
written off contained three of the largest docks in Europe and two of
the most important oil terminals. I took some liberties with the truth
because Ardersier lies on the ''civilised'' side of the line he drew,
but I thought a little hyperbole was justified in the circumstances.
More important is the fact that when the Highlands and Islands
Development Board was set up there was still an influential lobby in St
Andrew's House opposed to the idea of locating the headquarters among
the caterans in the North. If I mistake not, when Bob Grieve held the
first press conference as chairman of the board, he had to pay his own
fare to Inverness. The Highland capital was still off limits in St
Andrew's House.
A few years later, when the board was engaged in an imaginative but
ill-fated attempt to establish a bulb industry in Uist, I was approached
by a senior civil servant. A man who was well-disposed towards the
Highlands and Islands of the board's ''mad'' scheme, adding the
question, ''Have they given any thought to the immense difficulties of
marketing their bulbs from a remote place like the Outer Hebrides?''
''For goodness sake,'' I said to him, ''We're talking about North
Uist, not the North Pole! If they can make artificial flowers in Hong
Kong and sell them in Stornoway what's the problem about growing real
bulbs in Uist and selling them in Glasgow?'' This ghostly Highland
boundary is a good deal more tenuous now but it still exists: deeply
engrained in long established habits of official thought. At the popular
level it is represented by one word -- teuchter!
So it comes about that we have on the table concrete plans for a
university of the Highlands and Islands. (These have unfortunately been
rejected by the Millennium Commission, but that rejection does not in
any way invalidate the proposal.) This would be a new type of
university, unlike anything that now exists. A university for the
future. The structure out of which it will evolve is already in place.
Curriculum and courses are being actively planned.
Yet the Scottish Office stands a little aloof. Blowing hot and cold,
or blowing not at all. Still unable to believe that the Highlands can be
at the cutting edge of anything. Still wondering incredulously: ''Can
any good thing come out of Nazareth?''
Twelve existing educational institutions are working together to
create the University of the Highlands. They are located in Shetland,
Orkney, the Western Isles, Skye, Caithness, Inverness, Moray, Argyll,
and Perth. Every part of the area will have a local input and a local
campus. The small communities scattered over a sixth of the land surface
of Britain will be united in common endeavour as they have never been
before, to do something new and innovative and exciting.
The concept of a dispersed university, linked electronically, is based
on a report by Professor Sir Graham Hills. It was made possible by one
of the last acts of the old Highlands and Islands Development Board
before it was transformed into Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The
board, in a joint venture with British Telecom, endowed the Highlands
with an advanced telecommunications network which puts crofting villages
on a par with major cities, and gives them a clear advantage over the
peripheral areas of Europe.
The network provides a permanent basis for the concept of a dispersed
university but the head start over other peripheral areas is a wasting
asset. If Scotland is to lead the field and get the kudos, the 12
participating institutions must get the funding now. They cannot afford
to sit and wait while departments of central government remain sterile
or gestate like elephants.
That the Millennium Commission could not accept the proposal for a
University of the Highlands and Islands is a setback, no more. To quote
the recent submission to the commission: ''all undergraduates -- like
all staff members -- will have their own personal computers and will
build their knowledge capacities on the new technology. Liberated from
what was once the chore of soaking up knowledge, they can and will
devote more of their time and energies to the development of their
personalities, their talents, their competence and their confidence.''
The aim, in short, is to create the Renaissance Highlander.
The students in the University of the Highlands and Islands will not
be closeted in tiny, parochial institutions. Arrangements are already
being made to access the resources of established universities at home
and abroad. Renaissance Highlander will find it easier to tap into
Harvard than borrow a peat from the stack next door.
The concept of relatively small dispersed campuses does raise the
question of whether students will suffer by isolation. Contact with
other students is one of the great virtues of the traditional Scottish
University. This is something I can relate to readily.
I became editor of the Stornoway Gazette in 1932; I was the only
professional journalist in the Western Isles. There was no trunk
telephone across the Minch. There was no air service and only one
steamer a day. Visits from mainland journalists were rare. I know what
professional and intellectual loneliness means.
The submission by the University of the Highlands and Islands
identifies the problem and makes specific suggestions for meeting it,
even turning it to advantage. Quite apart from that, in the age of
television and tele-communications, the isolated, enclosed Highland
village has ceased to exist. We now have an opportunity to offer
students from outside the Highlands the experience of studying in the
most modern technological setting, with access to every source of
information in the world, while still living in a compact, classless
community where neighbours know each other and every door is open. This
is something no city can provide. It is a field in which the Highlands
has already had some experience.
The old Highland board used to run a seminar in conjunction with the
Overseas Development Agency (ODA) and the British Council, for senior
administrators from the Third World, studying at British universities.
On the first Sunday of the course each year the participants were
invited out for tea. Invariably when they thanked their hosts the
visitors said: ''We have been studying for 18 months in a British
University, but this is the first time we have ever been inside a
British home.'' In the modern world information is easily provided. It
is the warm, human environment that is difficult to provide, and
precious.
In an excusable historical flourish, the submission mentioned above
claims that the proposed University of the Highlands and Islands might
do so for the area what the monks of St Columba did in the first
millennium. That is what one might call intellectual history. It carries
no emotional charge. We make the comparison and accept it with a nod.
The danger is in what one might call visceral history. The facts, the
myths, the mixture of fact and myth, which is carried, not in the brain,
but in the heart, or more often in the spleen. We see this in the
instant, automatic, response to any mention of the Clearances, the
potato famine, emigration, the discouragement of Gaelic, the press-gang
or the slaughter on Drumossie moor in 1746. ''Battles long ago,''
perhaps, but still influencing the current debate.
The Jacobite defeat at Culloden was a disaster for the Highlands. The
only thing that could have been worse would have been a Jacobite
victory. There is no evidence that the Stuarts were favourably disposed
towards the Highlands. The break up of the Highland clan system was
government policy in Scotland before the Union of the Parliaments, even
before the Union of the Crowns. It is a lowland Scottish, not an
English, or even a British, phenomenon.
In national terms, the battle of Culloden was a climax. The end of a
bloody civil war. The end of the long dynastic struggle. The last battle
fought on British soil. The 250th anniversary, in April next year,
deserves to be officially commemorated by the British Government, and
even more by the Scottish Office, as a significant historical occasion.
Many people in the Highlands see Culloden (incorrectly, but with some
justification) not as an end, but a beginning. The beginning of a period
of repression, of an attack on the indigenous culture, of an aggressive
anti-Gaelic bias in Scottish education, of the attempted suppression of
tartan and the bagpipes. All the memories, of which the Clearances are
the bitterest, are perceived as stemming from the battle of Culloden. It
is for the historian to decide where precisely the truth may lie. The
politician must deal pragmatically with the situation as it is.
The anniversary of Culloden will offer the politician -- perhaps, in
this context I should say the statesman -- a rare opportunity to defuse
the past by a simple, imaginative act. Mark the anniversary of a battle,
which is burned into Highland memory as a great evil, by launching the
University of the Highlands and Islands, which will lay the ghosts and
point us firmly to the future.
* Dr James Shaw Grant looks at the Highlands from the long perspective
of one of the most distinguished journalists ever to have worked there.
As a young reporter he interviewed the last surviving ringleaders of the
Park Deer Raid of 1887, and an eyewitness of the Bernera Riot of 1872.
He edited the Stornoway Gazette for 30 years, and was for many years
Stornoway correspondent of the then Glasgow Herald. He was chairman of
the Crofters Commission for 15 years, and chairman of the board of
Pitlochry Festival Theatre for 12 years. Dr Grant is a CBE and a Fellow
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

HONG KONG: A man was seriously injured when four armed men robbed a
Hong Kong jewellery shop and escaped with #85,000 in gold ornaments.
Four men tied up the five staff members at the shop in the busy shopping
and tourist district of Tsimshatsui before making off with HK$1m in
gold. On Thursday, a woman was shot in the arm during a robbery of
jewellery at the nearby Peninsula hotel.

THE RAC's knights of the road have charged into the 21st century
before it has even arrived. The road patrol have added their ''bible''
to CD-ROM portable units to electronically boost roadside diagnosis and
service.
The compact disc units, which add to the RAC's claim to be the most
technologically advanced motoring organisation in Europe follows a
highly successful test with 40 key patrols around the UK. Now a large
scale pilot scheme has been launched with more than a quarter of the
1250 patrols linked to the hardware. The rest should be on line later
this year.
Basically the lightweight Panasonic units read a small compact disc
using innovative software to store the entire patrolman's ''bible'', the
equivalent of thousands of pages of printed information from a variety
of sources.
When the ROM unit is switched on, patrolmen have a vast array of
information at their fingertips and the software will be updated monthly
with the latest information they need. Using text and graphics including
electrical diagrams, the CD players cover the essentials of almost every
vehicle an RAC knight is likely to encounter. It can hold the equivalent
of 160,000 pages.
Supplementary information which helps the patrolmen give a better and
faster service, includes the details of local car dealerships and repair
shops, lists of entitlements available to members of various RAC motor
manufacturer and fleet schemes, health and safety guidelines and
technical bulletins. It may even be possible to add hotel and
accommodation guides.
Future plans include an audio playback to allow the RAC men to hear
various stages of complex dignities processes while leaving their hands
free to carry out the job.
Initial tests have proved an instant success with the road-risers who
have found working with reams of paper on a wet and windy night far from
easy.
And naturally, despite being all hi-tech, they're still as courteous
as ever, of course.
* ABERDEEN University and Oil giants Conoco are collaborating on the
creation of a new natural history centre for schools and colleges to
mark the university's 500th anniversary.
The Conoco Natural History Centre will have a resources unit for
teachers, students and the public and will be aimed at fostering a
better understanding of the environment. Principal, Professor Maxwell
Irvine said: ''The environment is an important issue and it is essential
to people's understanding of the living world and its problems be
improved in ordeer to protect it properly.
''The grant from Conoco enables us to extend people's knowledge and
enjoyment of natural history in a very practical way. It is an excellent
example of co-operation between industry and education which will
beneift not just school and college students, but the community as a
whole.''
The centre will incorporate the university's Zoology Museum, the
largest in Scotland and the fifth biggest in the UK with valuable
collections of animals and birds. The department of Plant and Soil
Science maintains the Cruickshank Botanic garden in 11 acres of Old
Aberdeen. Together the garden and museum represent a significant pool of
information about life on earth.
The foundation of the centre will be marked annually by a Conoco
lecture on an environmental subject to be given at the university by a
distinguished speaker.
* LAST week Frontiers told you about two research teams, at St
Andrew's and Strathclyde Universities who have taken laser light
technology a couple of light years ahead. Not to be outdone, Glasgow Uni
are also beaming ahead at full warp on the light-wave front.
In a move they claim can be compared with the leap from valve to
solid-state electronics (and that's a pretty hefty claim) Glasgow's
engineers have developed a laser-pulse source which will enable fibre
optics to reach their full potential. The fibre-nets carry the vast bulk
of international communications and face phenomenal demands to transmit
even more information at greater speeds.
The Glasgow Optoelectronics Group have devised an ultra-short system
that's compact, efficient and can be mass produced cheaply, which they
believe will vastly increase the fibre-optic potential with immense
commercial implications.
Developed by Joaquim Martins-Filho, supervised by Dr Charles Ironside,
the system uses a semiconductor laser similar to that in a C D player,
but one which works at incredibly fine ''ultra-short'' pulses which fire
at picoseconds, one million-millionth of a second, or, for the layman,
pretty darned fast.
Present picosecond light pulses are generally large and inefficient
which need constant maintenance. The Glasgow laser is half-millimetre
chip which produces coherent light which then pulses very quickly
indeed.
Dr Ironside tells us: ''This laser has a wide range of potential
applications including high-speed optical communications, clocks for
computers and a kind of optical radar.''

FOR a man so visually steeped in medieval technology -- to wit the
broadsword and armoured helm -- Scots performer Jesse Rae is
surprisingly ahead of the game when it comes to electronics.
His new album not only spans the globe musically, but literally. Jesse
and his co-performers were oceans apart when they recorded the tracks
linked by BT's Integrated Services Digital network.
The hi-tech link meant that Jesse was able to perform the vocals in
his open air Scottish studio in St Boswells while the rest of the band
in the United States played the music. The result is the world's first
Superhighway album Compression, including tracks such as ''Wha's Like
Us'', ''Brave Heart'' and ''Auld Lang Syne''.
In his studio, Jesse said: ''We have recorded 35 tunes, so there will
actually be five sides on the album. The first two sides will be
available soon. The ISDN system meant that after being musically
isolated I can now work directly with my friends in the States and Japan
and other countries.
''I always work outside and they are surprised when they sometimes
hear the odd bird or chicken or a cow mooing.
''I am hoping to play the tracks live on the ISDN system which will
let me sing in several cities simultaneously on a video backdrop of the
band playing in America.''
Ray Pritchard, BT's international ISDN manager said: ''The remote
studio is a reality thanks to the clarity of the audio provided by the
digital network over a normal telephone line. The costs of producing a
record are cut drastically when the artists no longer have to travel to
a studio. The ISDN will dramatically change the way the music industry
works. Solo artists and independent record companies will benefit.''
The integrated services network lets users send and receive huge
volumes of data text, voice and image over the phone network. Users can
run a variety of applications instead of many different types of
networks for communications.
Jesse's system uses the APT Pro-Link manager and a codec to compress
the digital signal for transmission via the BT network to the US,
London, Japan, Sydney, Australia and Northern Ireland.

KNOWING your rights is one thing, getting them can be quite another.
Legal aid is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain and the potential
cost of paying for legal proceedings out of our own pocket is more than
many of us can afford. This is why more people are taking out legal
expenses insurance in conjunction with their motor and household
policies.
Many insurance policies nowadays include 24-hour legal helplines as a
free service. They will deal with any sort of personal legal query.
Everything is covered from consumer and employment disputes to
matrimonial and landlord and tenant problems.
Suzanne McCormack, who works on Hambro Legal Protection's Scottish
helpline in Glasgow, says: ''We get asked about almost everything, but
consumer law is probably the most frequent source of queries. People
want to know what to do if they have purchased something which is
faulty. Negligence is another subject that is coming up more often these
days. People are becoming more aware that they can seek legal redress.''
The helplines are well worth making use of. They will tell you where
you stand legally and give you practical advice about what to do next.
You can normally ring more than once on the same subject so you can get
ongoing advice. Following it could mean your problems can be resolved
out of court.
If they can't and you want to go to court, you may qualify for legal
aid but only if your income falls within certain limits. To qualify for
full civil legal aid at present your net income (after various
deductions such as mortgage interest) must be less than #2425 and your
savings must not exceed #3000. Some legal aid will be given if your net
income is between #2425 and #7187 (or #7920 in personal injury cases),
and your savings are less than #6750 (#8560). But if your income or
savings exceed these levels, you are on your own no matter how good a
case you may have.
Despite these strict limits, the legal aid bill in Scotland has been
mounting steadily from #50m in 1987/88 to #125m in 1994/95. Although no
steps are currently being taken to cap the amount spent in Scotland as
they are in England and Wales, Richard Scott of the legal aid board in
Edinburgh believes something will soon be done to halt the increase.
This could make legal aid even more difficult to obtain.
One way of making sure you can afford legal proceedings is to take out
legal expenses insurance as an add-on to your motor and household
policies. For an extra #10 to #15 a year, your fees will be paid in a
variety of cases.
Adding legal expenses protection to motor insurance policies has
become particularly popular because it covers the cost of pursuing
claims for uninsured losses if you are involved in an accident which is
not your fault. These losses can include compensation if you are
injured, as well as for your family if you are killed, your policy
excess and the hire of a replacement vehicle while yours is being
repaired. An added advantage of recovering your uninsured losses from
the other side is that you will not lose your no-claims discount.
With the legal expenses insurer negotiating on your behalf, most of
these cases are settled out of court. But if not, legal costs of up to
between #25,000 and #50,000 will be paid out for each claim. This amount
includes solicitors' and barristers' fees, court costs, expenses for
expert witnesses and the other side's costs if you lose.
Cover provided by the legal expenses add-on to household insurance
policies is more variable. Some policies give only basic cover for
consumer disputes, so legal action can be taken against the suppliers of
defective goods or services, and for pursuing personal injury claims.
Others give more extensive cover.
Direct Line Insurance, for instance, which offers legal protection
cover in conjunction with DAS, the specialist legal expenses insurer,
gives cover which enables you to pursue claims relating to your home,
such as boundary disputes, and to contract of employment disputes, as
well as consumer and personal injury claims.
If you are not offered a legal expenses extension by your insurer, or
it does not give broad enough cover, you can purchase a separate add-on
policy through your insurance broker. Hambro Legal Protection's policy
of this type is probably the most comprehensive. Besides those areas
already mentioned, it will also pay legal fees relating to the defence
of motoring prosecutions, the defence of civil claims in relation to
goods sold privately by you as well as fees arising from an in-depth
investigation by the Inland Revenue into your private tax affairs.
One important proviso made by all the legal expenses insurers is that
they will only agree to pay a claim if they believe your case has a
reasonable prospect of success. But according to one insurer the main
reason claims are usually turned down is that they relate to problems
which had already started before cover was taken out.

IF racing is to prosper, it must cater for all its customers whose
requirements do not always coincide, Tristram Ricketts, chief executive
of the British Horseracing Board said last night when he answered recent
criticism of too many race meetings.
He was speaking in Glasgow at The Herald Scottish National Hunt Racing
Awards dinner at which Dumfriesshire's Len Lungo received the leading
trainer award and Dawn Goodfellow, of Lauder, the leading permit-holder
award.
Since the 1996 fixture list was published earlier this week there has
been heated argument throughout the racing industry about the extended
programme with more emphasis on evening meetings.
Ricketts acknowledged there also was concern among national and
provincial newspapers about the pressure on space caused by the number
of racecards.
The new programme, he said, reflected the BHB's ''continuing strong
commitment to the customer-friendly principles which racing embraced.''
If the industry was to attract and retain owners, it must provide
adequate opportunities for them to run their horses and to watch them.
Racegoers wanted meetings when they, too, had leisure time and, for
that reason, particular emphasis had been put on evening meetings.
In addition, punters needed a regular diet of competitive racing which
not only gave them enjoyment but boosted the betting levy which, at more
than #50m a year, was a significant source of revenue for racing.
The need to cater for all key customers and maximise the net benefit
to racing called for the current size of the fixture list.
''Every fixture is serving a purpose, often several,'' he told his
audience, which included all sections of the racing industry in
Scotland.
Ricketts said racing must also be sensitive to the position of the
betting industry which is currently under pressure from the National
Lottery, especially scratch cards.
It was necessary that racing and betting worked together to counter
this impact.
He welcomed The Herald's introduction of prestigious National Hunt
awards at a time when Scottish racing was ''clearly very much alive and
kicking.''
In accepting the award from Iain Forbes, managing director of
Caledonian Newspapers Limited, Lungo acknowledged the contribution of
his staff, his owners, and his stable jockeys, Tim Reed and Fraser
Perratt, who between them rode 27 of his 28 winners.
He welcomed The Herald awards for Scottish trainers because ''it is
good publicity for Scottish racing and draws attention to what we can
achieve in Scotland.''
Lungo added: ''It will help dispel the widely held belief that if you
own a racehorse it can only be trained in Newmarket or Lambourn.
''By the number of winners we are producing, Scottish trainers are
demonstrating they can provide knowledgeable advice, individual
facilities which are far less crowded than anything available in the
south, and value-for-money training fees.''

THE financial services industry is changing fast. At the beginning of
the year Ian McDonald Wood at management consultant Millenium Group
predicted companies completely unconnected with financial services would
take a significant slice of the market and that brand image, the
telephone, customer service and new technology would be the key factors
determining which companies would survive into the next century.
Prediction is a tricky game, but in the last six months the signs are
that Millenium's views were spot on. Telephone selling is becoming
increasingly sophisticated with firms such as Direct Line and First
Direct taking the mystique out of mortgages and other products, while
companies like Virgin and Marks &amp; Spencer continue to exploit their
famous brand names.
In March Virgin launched its first financial product, a no frills,
low-cost tracker fund PEP, and last month Marks &amp; Spencer added life
insurance and pensions to the range of financial products it sells along
with the knickers and cashmere jumpers.
Direct Line has taken less than a year to capture 1% of the mortgage
market by applying the same pioneering formula it used on car insurance
10 years ago. It keeps its prices down by cutting out the middle man and
offering simple products. Without an expensive branch network to
maintain, it can shave nearly a percentage point off the standard
variable mortgage rate.
The company also has the technology. Last week I visited its Glasgow
operation and watched as the operators, who undergo a six-to-eight week
training programme, agreed mortgages over the phone.
Direct Line sells the simple capital-and-interest variety but if you
already have an endowment policy or a personal pension, you can have
part or all of your loan on an interest-only basis. Its computer system
allows the operator to alter the split to suit the customer and can
produce the monthly repayment at the flick of a switch. I watched as one
customer juggled the repayment period and the split between
interest-only and capital-and-interest terms to come up with a monthly
repayment he felt he could afford.
First Direct, the telephone banking arm of the Midland Bank, and
Bradford &amp; Bingley are now using the same formula to sell mortgages over
the telephone. At Direct Line the interest rate is 7.42%. First Direct
is charging 7.39% and Bradford &amp; Bingley 7.3%. This compares with a
standard variable rate of 8.35% at the Halifax, 8.44% from the
Nationwide and 8.39% from the Leeds.
However, none of these lenders are keen on bad debts so you can only
get a mortgage of up to 85% of valuation with Direct Line and 75% with
Bradford &amp; Bingley's Mortgages Direct. First Direct lends up to 95% on
loans up to #150,000. Above that it stops at 80% of valuation.
Richard Branson's Virgin Direct continues to show the strength of a
good brand name. Consumers view Branson as on their side in the fight
against the fat cats, which is why financial services are such an
obvious area for Virgin to get into.
The Virgin Direct PEP follows a winning formula of a low-cost, no
frills product sold without the benefit of a middle man. Virgin has
opted for a fund which tracks the FTSE-100 index. Funds of this type are
not only cheap to manage but also out-perform most funds where there is
a manager in charge. The charges on the Virgin PEP are an attractive 1%
a year, with no initial fees at all. More than 14,000 investors have put
in over #60m since the fund was launched in March, and the money
continues to flow in at the rate of #5m a week.
Marks &amp; Spencer has been linking its brand name to financial services
for 10 years -- it launched its charge card and personal loans in 1985.
Three years later it followed it up with a unit trust, which has been a
steady rather than a spectacular performer, as the company predicted. In
May it launched the M&amp;S personal pension and a number of life insurance
policies, including a family income plan and serious illness scheme.

WHEN Royal High take the field today at Barnton against Carlton it
will be for one member of the team a historic occasion. David Fraser has
made 625 first-team appearances, the same number as the evergreen Fred
Thomas, who has held the record until now.
No doubt the club will mark the achievement as it sees fit, but for
the laconic Fraser the most appropriate way to celebrate the event will
be to win the match.
That will be no easy matter, however, as the visitors are posing a
real threat to Ryden League defending champions Heriot's, having won all
their matches since losing to Grange on the opening day. The Herioters
remain ahead of them by virtue of a 100% record which is at stake when
they visit Myreside, where Watsonians would like nothing better than to
spike the guns of their old rivals.
Edinburgh plays Fife at Stockbridge as Falkland visit Edinburgh
Academicals and Grange entertain Freuchie. On recent form, the smart
money would have to be on Edinburgh to take the points.

THE D M Hall Western Union championship reaches the turn today. While
the likes of leaders Clydesdale eye up a trip to play champions and
second-placed Ayr -- a match which could have a significant bearing on
the long run-in -- others are still trying to get out of the stalls.
Ironically, while the pace-setters meet this weekend, so to do the
tail-enders, the basement side Uddingston playing Kilmarnock NK. Both
are still chasing their first win of the season, which for the latter
has been spent on the road.
''Hopefully, the square at Kirkstyle will be ready for next week,''
says Killie skipper Alan Hill, who says the club's bar takings have
suffered more than the team spirit during the gardening project.
Captain Hill has seen a turnaround in his side this season, the
marriage with NKOA beginning to show some returns now, if not wins.
''Everyone has been playing for the team, and over the last few weeks
we've seen a steady improvement. We had a couple of winning draws, and
last week we scored well over 200 at Poloc -- and lost.''

LEADERS Ayrshire face their longest trip of the season today -- to the
Granite City to meet Aberdeenshire, who are unbeaten but have only one
win from four starts.
''When we joined the Counties, we approached this fixture
tentatively,'' recalls Ayrshire skipper Andy Tennant. ''Now we win
there. The current Aberdeenshire side is talented, but the visit holds
no fears.''
Drew Parsons, who joined from Kilmarnock this season, is still only 20
but is averaging 40 with the bat and has bagged 15 wickets with his
left-arm, over-the-wicket seam.
But Ayrshire resources are tested today with wicketkeeper Colin Berry,
Ian McGregor, and Martyne Hay unavailable. Alan Haggo dons the gloves,
with teenager Gavin Pitt and Andrew Gibson also stepping in.
Forfarshire travel hopefully to West Lothian, who have Graham Welsh
and Gordon Hollins available again.
Stirling County's task at Clackmannan is toughened by the loss of
bowlers Willie Morton and George McGuire, while the homesters introduce
a new wicketkeeper/batsman in Cornishman Alex Comer.

THOSE who missed the first public offer of shares in 3i, when the
banks which originally set it up put around 48% of the shares on offer a
year ago, have had a second chance. The banks are selling another 20.9%
and we will now see what effect this extra supply has as these shares
pass into the hands of institutions and individual investors who took
part in the placing.
Those who brushed aside the doubts and bought first time round have
done nicely. The shares rose about 90p and out-paced the All-Share index
by some 25%, which is not at all bad going for a company which is so big
that it is in the FTSE-100 index.
An attraction of 3i -- the name is a contraction of its earlier, very
descriptive title Investors In Industry -- was that with the first
offering it was changing its status to become an investment trust. This
meant almost #151m of deferred tax was no longer payable, giving an
unrepeatable rise in net asset value.
One of the worries was that its share price would fall to a sizeable
discount as so many investment trusts do. In its short life as a quoted
investment trust, however, its price has hovered around asset value. It
seems fair to ask oneself if that satisfactory situation was because, as
an index stock, it would be wanted by funds which seek index weightings
while the shares could be in tight supply. After all, an investor who
wanted an index weighting would in effect be 100% overweight in terms of
the free float of shares available to the market.
With another 20.9% coming on offer, the scarcity value would be
reduced. Robin Angus at NatWest Securities does not accept the argument.
The fact that 31% of the capital will remain unavailable to the market
''spells a continuing stock shortage'', he says.
Another worry at the time of the original flotation was that an
overhang of just over half the capital which could be put on offer would
depress the price. This did not happen and Mr Angus believes there
should not be overhang worries about the remaining 31%.
The continuing bank shareholdings ''do not give the appearance of
being loosely held''. He adds: ''Of course, working as I do for one of
the banks which has decided not to sell any of its shares, I am probably
even less likely to know what the banks are thinking than is the man who
cleans the lavatories in 3i's offices.''
Common sense, however, suggests that when you have had two chances to
sell but have decided to hold on, it is unlikely you are falling over
yourself to dump your stock.
NatWest Bank is keeping 17.8%, Barclays and Midland around 5% each,
and Bank of Scotland 2.5%. Looking at all this he feels that in a year's
time the second offering will be recognised as having been a
strengthening influence on the market rating rather than a weakening
one.
The company is, of course, the biggest provider of financial backing
for small and medium unquoted firms. It was set up to fill a gap in the
provision of finance for small and growing firms and that is what it is
still doing, while trying its best to avoid providing too much finance
for small and failing firms.
Mr Angus makes the point that it is really ''an investment business
which happens to have the tax structure of an investment trust''. As
Hamish Buchan, also of NatWest Securities, comments: ''Investment trust
status is a flag of convenience. Why pay capital gains tax if you do not
have to?'' He sees the company as more of an industrial conglomerate
with a staff of 600 negotiating deals and so on.
Mr Angus argues: ''If 3i continues to sell at no more than its
tangible net asset backing it will still offer its shareholders superior
growth in assets and dividends. This I believe will happen because of
the nature of the businesses in which it invests. But 3i is itself a
business -- a growth business and a value-added business. I can think of
very few value-added growth businesses in Britain today which sell for
only the tangible asset backing of the shares with nothing built into
the price for future prospects.''
Its investment trust status means the company is now ''free as it
never was during the years prior to flotation to make investment
decisions on investment grounds alone, unencumbered by any necessity to
weigh up the consequences of its actions as regards taxation of capital
profits. Every penny of the capital profits it realises can be ploughed
back into the business for re-investment. There will be no leakage of
profits out of the pockets of the shareholders and into the coffers of
the Inland Revenue.''
The NatWest analysts admit 3i will be a cyclical stock. But history
suggests that if you look at it over a period it does not suffer swings
as vicious as the economic cycle itself. Considering the present
position, Mr Angus believes it offers the next best thing to assured
growth. Some 37% of its investments have been held for three years or
less. The benefits of these will start to come through in revaluations
over the next two to three years.
So, assuming you believe that small firms can grow better than big
ones and that 3i will pick the necessary balance of successful ones --
obviously it has backed some losers -- you have a company where good
news is automatically deferred owing to the time-lag in valuing the
investments, but where because of the economic recovery we have had
there should still be some coming up.
It is pulling out of the US market but is hoping for better success in
venturing into Europe where Mr Angus sees ''a huge opportunity''.

AHAM Okeke, one of Europe's top sprinters, was yesterday handed a
provisional two-month suspension after testing positive for
testosterone, but was told by the Norwegian Sports Federation that he
faces a stiffer penalty.
The federation stressed that a final ruling was being postponed until
his appeal against a previous doping charge is settled.
They demanded that Okeke be barred for five years after he tested
positive in the United States on December 5. That was the second time in
six months that he had tested positive for a banned substance. Urine
tests taken in July, 1994, showed the performance enhancing drug
pseudofedrin.
Okeke was acquitted in the first doping case, but the Norwegians
appealed, the decision was reversed and Okeke was suspended for three
months and six days for using pseudofedrin. Okeke then appealed to the
national sports arbitration board, who have not yet decided whether they
will hear the case.

FOR all of their #40,000 investment in bringing British sailing's
showcase, the Vauxhall Ultra Grand Prix, to the Tay off Dundee's #3m
Discovery Point visitors' centre for the first time, the one key element
the Dundee partnership could not control fell firmly in their favour.
As if to order, the Caribbean sun brought in a perfect, easterly
sea-breeze to give the six Ultra crews a challenging day's racing.
Indeed, so good proved the conditions that the skippers opted to sail an
additional third race.
The 30ft Ultras were designed to pressurise all the key crew
manouevres. With the action condensed into a sprinting course only 800m
long with two turning marks, and the fleet compressed through a narrow
gate upwind and downwind, it again underlined the superiority of Lawrie
Smith's crew on Vauxhall Frontera.
Smith, Barcelona bronze medallist in the Soling class, has retained
the same core crew for more than three years but lost for the first time
in three years in the opening round at Portsmouth three weeks ago.
Yesterday, Frontera won the first and third races, capitalising on their
superior boat handling, making fewer crewing mistakes, and further
underlining Smith's acumen in choosing the favoured angles downwind.
Scottish interests rode with Seoul gold medallist Mike McIntyre in
Orbitel. With two new Scots joining his pool since Portsmouth -- where
he placed fourth -- Orbitel's day got better.
After a disastrous start to the first heat, in which they were left
almost standing, their spinnaker tore on the first downwind leg, forcing
them to sail four of the next six laps without the massive power of the
asymmetric sail and they ended up last.
A clean start to the third heat and better cohesion among the crew
finally showed as they took second place to Smith, who leads overall
from Russell Peters in DBS by one point.
Racing continues with three races daily, from 12.45 today and from
1.45 tomorrow. Results:
Vauxhall Ultra 30 Grand Prix: Race 1 -- 1, Frontera (Lawrie Smith); 2,
DBS (R Peters); 3, Team Mobil (Eddie Warden-Owen); 4, Cable &amp; Wireless
(Glyn Charles); 5, Debra (Roger Yeoman); 6, Orbitel (Mike McIntyre).
Race 2 -- 1, Cable &amp; Wireless; 2, Mobil; 3, DBS; 4, Debra; 5,
Frontera; 6, Orbitel.
Race 3 -- 1, Frontera; 2, Orbitel; 3, DBS; 4, Cable &amp; Wireless; 5,
Mobil; 6, Debra.
Overall after three races -- 1, Frontera 14pts; 2 DBS 13; 3, Cable &amp;
Wireless 12; 4, Team Mobil 11; 5, Orbitel 7; 6 Debra 6.

HIGHER profits at Stoddard Sekers International last year were dented
by #1.1m of flood damage to its carpet factory in Kilmarnock.
This reduced the impact of a 20% increase in operating profits and an
exceptional #862,000 gain from property disposals.
The factory damage, caused by torrential rain in December, meant the
carpet and upholstery group based at Elderslie in Renfrewshire could
only report an 8% rise in pre-tax profit to #2.3m for the year to March
31.
Turnover edged up 2% to #60.9m as the company continued to suffer from
the reluctance of home-owners to buy new carpets. But contract sales of
specially-designed carpets to large customers such as hotels, casinos,
cruise ships and department stores were more buoyant.
The charge for flood damage to the BMK factory in Kilmarnock related
mainly to damaged machinery and carpet stocks. Stoddard Sekers managed
to switch a lot of production to its Elderslie factory while repairs
were undertaken.
Looking ahead, chief executive Ralph Ellis saw some signs of stronger
demand in the retail carpet sector, which accounts for 58% of group
sales. But the lack of a ''feel-good'' factor among consumers still
hangs like an albatross around the neck of the carpet industry.
''The biggest single problem is the 'feel-bad' factor and that as far
as I can see is a political problem more than anything else,'' Mr Ellis
said.
''What we really need to give us a big lift is just a little more
buoyancy and bounce among the people who feel threatened by things like
mortgage rises, negative equity and job security,'' he said.
Mr Ellis said there had recently been an increase in the number of
inquiries for both contract and retail sales. But he said the trading
situation remained tight and any improvement would only come during the
second half of the financial year.
''The summer months are always quiet, even in good times,'' Mr Ellis
said, noting that carpet sales normally peak in the winter between
November and February.
Despite its flat sales and profit performance, Stoddard Sekers was
able to reduce its gearing to 31% from 44% last year.
The company proposed a final dividend of 0.85p, maintaining its
full-year payout unchanged at 1.6p. This is amply covered by earnings
per share of 3p.
Stoddard Sekers shares were unchanged at 31p.

IN all the furore in recent months about so-called greed in Britain's
boardrooms, far too little attention has been paid to alternative ways
of structuring rewards and incentives in companies from the executive
corridor all the way down to the shopfloor.
The current obsession with bonuses, share options, three-year rolling
contracts and other perks for tiny management elites has tended to
stifle any serious public debate about the advantages that might flow
from a wider adoption of more radical ways to involve all workers in the
companies that employ them.
Concepts such as employee share ownership and profit related pay are
certainly not new. More and more companies have tax efficient share
option savings schemes and, thanks to other tax changes in recent years,
PRP is also more common.
But few companies take these concepts to their logical conclusion and
explore the merits of employees owning their businesses outright. There
have been countless management buy-outs of businesses in the past two
decades. But these typically involve small groups of managers backed by
institutional money. There have been some management-employee buy-outs
too, although most shares in the latter are typically held
disproportionately by small cadres of managers.
This time last year, one significant Scottish family-owned company
completed a capital reconstruction which, in the fullness of time, will
see ownership transfer to the entire workforce. Earlier this month the
group, papermaker and specialist coater Tullis Russell, reported strong
sales and profit growth in the first nine months of its new existence.
Despite rocketing pulp prices ($390 a tonne in the final quarter of
1993, heading for $1000 a tonne by this October) it has pushed pro-forma
unaudited annual sales up from #101m to #124m, and has raised pre-tax
profits from #4.6m to #6.3m.
At the main papermaking business at Markinch in Fife, production leapt
26% to 106,000 tonnes. Brittains, TR's paper transfer business which
serves the ceramics industry from its Stoke-on-Trent base, had a record
year. The Cheshire-based Coated Papers business had its second best ever
year. And Watson Grange, TRG's coverings business at Linwood, which was
losing money from 1991 to 1994, is back in the black.
The question inevitably arises: has the transfer of ownership of the
business so revolutionised attitudes among Tullis Russell's 1200-strong
workforce that they are now delivering the goods in a way which could
never have happened under a regime where their only stake was a regular
pay cheque?
It is certainly true, because of the way the reconstruction was
devised, that the more profitable Tullis Russell Group becomes in the
years ahead, the more rapidly ownership will move directly into the
hands of individual employees. But TRG's executive team are careful not
to make too grandiose claims for what is, in effect, a long-term
experiment in changing employee attitudes and creating a radically
different structure of ownership in industry.
Chairman David Erdal, a Harvard MBA and the last serving member of the
family which owned Tullis Russell, points to evidence from the US that
employee-owned companies with strong management do out-perform other
kinds of companies.
Chief executive James Daglish says: ''We don't just see employee
ownership as a philosophical thing. We do see it as a route to business
success.'' Finance director George Wishart adds: ''People, in the
reality of the workplace, are thinking about their shareholding all the
time. It doesn't solve problems. But it helps.''
There was, perhaps, a kind of inevitability that Tullis Russell would
travel this unusual route. Created in 1809 by Cupar printer and St
Andrews University publisher Robert Tullis, when he converted a flour
mill on the Markinch site to paper making, the business was bought into
by the Russell family in 1874, by David Erdal's great grandfather.
It prospered by moving into innovative products such as electrical
cable insulating paper and branded but unwatermarked printing paper. The
Tullis family had departed by the thirties, lured, like so many other
industrial families, by the prospect of life as landed gentry.
In 1947, the charitable Russell Trust was set up in memory of one of
David Erdal's uncles, Pat Russell, who had been killed in the war. It
was given a quarter share of the company's equity. One can still sense
an ethos around the Markinch site of those industrial communities like
New Lanark, Bournville and Port Sunlight, which pioneered new ethical
standards in the care they took of their employees.
''There was a real sense of responsibility for this community,'' says
Erdal of the mood in the family generation before his. That generation
was determined to protect the independence of the company as far as
possible, if it served the interest of the employees. The majority of
family shares were moved into a family trust, controlled by management
trustees. The members responsible minuted their reasons.
''There was a fairly clear message to my generation,'' says Erdal.
''It was that they were not having any of that floating or listing
business.'' But, as in every family company as ownership spreads down
the generations, some of his contemporaries -- he is one of 14 in his
generation -- wanted access to their capital.
The reconstruction which was completed last year was designed to do
three things: keep the company independent, allow family shareholders an
exit and give employees a real stake in the business.
Employees have been able to buy shares in Tullis Russell since 1985.
But demand to buy was not satisfying some family members' appetite to
sell. ''This, after all, is a very left-wing area of Fife,'' Erdal
points out. ''Most people come from an anti-management tradition.''
''Even now,'' adds James Daglish, ''with new people joining the company,
we need to explain to some of them exactly what shares are.''
By the time of last year's reconstruction, employees owned around 7%
of the company's shares. Some 9% had been bought, some 2% sold back. An
employee share benefit trust, borrowing commercially with a company
guarantee, had bought a further 13% from family shareholders and acted
as a warehouse for the annual buying and selling of shares. But the
family still controlled 55%, while the Russell Trust had the remaining
25%.
The main bones of the reconstruction are that the remaining family
shareholders have exchanged their holdings for interest bearing loan
stock designed to be redeemed in three equal tranches in 1996, 1999 and
2002. These family shares have gone into an employee share ownership
trust.
Each year 7.5% of group profits will be used to allocate some of those
shares free to every employee with a year or more's service. The shares
are allocated 30% on a flat-rate basis, 70% according to earnings. Share
certificates are issued and dividends paid in the normal way. There is
no tax to pay if the shares are held for five years.
Every year, in August, the Edinburgh merchant bank Noble Grossart
fixes an independent value for the Tullis Russell shares. During that
trading period, employee shareholders who have held them for two years
can sell if they want to.
Erdal and his colleagues calculate that, as the full impact of the
reconstruction rolls out over the next 10 to 15 years, the average
share-owning employee in Tullis Russell could be some #16,000 better off
as a result.
The Tullis Russell model was, in part, made possible by changes in the
1994 Finance Act, which now allows sellers, in a case like this, to
claim capital gains tax rollover relief if the shares they sell to an
employee share ownership trust are passed on to the employees within 20
years.
The previous limit was seven years, which demanded either much more
rapid profit generation or employee willingness to invest heavily over a
shorter time period. ''That change,'' says Erdal, ''was a superb piece
of encouragement for the cause of employee share ownership.''
But isn't there a downside in all this, I wondered. If the employees
progressively own the business, won't the management be forced to fudge
crunch issues, like rationalisation that cuts jobs. The evidence from
the US is quite the reverse, he says.
''Since the first employee shareholdings in 1985,'' Daglish explains,
''we've reduced numbers from 1500 to 1200, with the bulk of the
reduction happening here at Markinch. We've found that people accept it,
if those who are going are treated in the most generous way we can.''
''Your question,'' Erdal adds, ''assumes that people are always
shortsighted, particularly when they have a real stake in the business.
We find that people are usually aware, long before the management makes
the decision, of what needs to be done and why.''
Some of those now the butt of public opprobrium about the size of
their own reward packages might do well to consider the kind of
alternative being fostered at Tullis Russell.

SCOTLAND made a good start in the Women's Home International
championship yesterday in Portrush, beating Wales 132-111 in their
opening match.
The Scots led 37-27 after five ends, but Wales were only eight down at
halfway and briefly led by three. However, the Scots quickly regained
the initiative and went on to a convincing 21-shot victory.
Dorothy Barr guided her rink to a 30-13 win over Rita Jones, including
a 6 on the last end that gave the Scots a useful cushion. Liz Dickson
added a 27-12 win over Pam Griffiths, while Sarah Gourlay edged out
Stella Oliver 20-17.
World indoor champion Joyce Lindores drew 20-20 with Betty Morgan, but
Frances Whyte, winning her fiftieth cap, dropped a last-end double to
lose 23-22 to Judith Wason and Janice Maxwell lost 36-13 to Cynthia
Morgan.
Champions England survived a slow start to beat hosts Ireland 143-110.
The Irish led 46-28 after five ends but England moved 75-63 ahead at
halfway and pulled away.
Scotland 132, Wales 111 (J Maxwell 13, C Morgan 26; D Barr 30, R Jones
13; F Whyte 22, J Wason 23; J Lindores 20, B Morgan 20; E Dickson 27, P

FOURTH seed Marc Rosset, of Switzerland, ended Jimmy Connors'
victorious return to the tournament scene yesterday as he beat the
battling American 7-6, 6-3 to reach the semi-finals of the #500,000
Halle Open in Bonn.
But there were more problems with the much-criticised grass court and
groundstaff had to fill a hole on the baseline after Rosset pulled out a
lump of turf with his trailing foot while serving in the first set.
Connors had his own problems with Rosset's booming service which was
just too fast for the American -- once even hitting him in the chest.
Connors had already more than lived up to organisers' hopes and his
hefty appearance money by getting through two rounds.
But after he lost the first set on a tie-break, Rosset's onslaught of
24 aces proved too much for him.
Another big server, top seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov, of Russia, went out
tamely 6-1, 7-6 to unseeded Dutchman Paul Haarhuis.
German Michael Stich set aside his earlier grumbles about the newly
laid centre-court turf to cruise past American Richey Reneberg 6-3, 6-4.
On a good day for the Dutch, Jacco Eltingh, also unseeded, put out New
Zealand's Brett Steven 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 to set up a semi-final against
Rosset.
* AUSTRALIAN Todd Woodbridge beat his Wimbledon doubles-winning
partner and best friend, Mark Woodforde, in their first head-to-head on
grass to reach the final of the Nottingham Open, and then admitted: ''I
hated that.''
Woodbridge edged home in a marathon two hours and seven minutes
three-setter but admitted: ''I guess it is something like beating your
wife.
''We know each other's game so well that we are always going to go in
against each other a bit tight.''
Both players blamed a high, swirling wind for a match of indifferent
quality, but in the end it was Woodbridge who coped better with the
conditions.
He won 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 to follow up his come-from-behind success against
Woodforde on the clay at Coral Beach two months ago.
Woodbridge went on to win that event, his first singles title, and now
faces unseeded Javier Frana, of Argentina, who dismissed Zimbabwe's
Byron Black 7-6, 7-5, for the #14,000 first prize.

NATHALIE Tauziat yesterday closed in on a #50,000 top prize in the
Direct Line Insurance tournament at Eastbourne and then took a verbal
swipe at the absent stars.
Tauziat beat Natasha Zvereva 6-2, 6-4 to line up a final against
American teenager Chanda Rubin.
But it will not be the top-line final the new sponsors anticipated
because nine of the world's top 10 declined to enter the singles at a
tournament once regarded as essential Wimbledon preparation.
''If you want to play well at Wimbledon you have to arrive early and
get plenty of matches on grass,'' said Tauziat.
''You can't just turn up for Wimbledon and expect to win. I'm a bit
surprised more top players are not here. But I don't know why.''
Steffi Graf expressed interest then changed her mind while Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario and Jana Novotna bafflingly restricted themselves to
doubles.
Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez refused to enter despite training
nearby and tuning up to spectate.
Attendances were down on each of the first four days but have climbed
to exceed the 1994 figure on the last two.
Tauziat has no regrets. She is grateful for the grass-court experience
which has set her up for a possible Wimbledon meeting with French rival
Mary Pierce.
''If I play Mary I think I will have a good chance on grass,'' said
Bayonne-based Tauziat, who was born in Africa.
''My confidence is sky high after reaching the final here. It will be
even higher if I win the final.''
Standing in her way is Rubin, daughter of a Louisiana judge.
She overwhelmed German Christina Singer 6-0, 6-0 in 45 minutes of
embarrassingly one-sided tennis.
Rubin, the 1992 Wimbledon junior champion, was also surprised at the
absence of so many big names from the singles.
''Maybe the top people find it easy to book practice time on good
grass courts.
''But there's more benefit in competing at Eastbourne than practising
at Wimbledon.''
Rubin knocked out Japanese top seed and world No.6 Kimiko Date on
Thursday.
She is in the form and the mood to bring off another upset in today's
final.

The former England captain hit twelve 4s and two 6s to finish unbeaten

DESPITE the most favourable Meadowbank conditions for many years, the
27-year-old national long-jump record survived the combined assault of
Duncan Mathieson and Darren Ritchie last night.
On a warm night, with the wind fluctuating around the legal limit of
two metres per second, Aberdeen decathlete Mathieson regained the
Scottish title with a leap of 7.49 metres, leaving David Walker's 7.67m
intact. Ritchie was second with 7.30m.
Mathieson's best legal effort was 7.43m, but he could content himself
with the second-best winning distance by a Scot since 1968. John Munroe,
Britain's representative at the European Cup final this weekend in
Lille, may struggle to jump as far.
The Aberdeen jumper, on just five weeks' training, was one centimetre
beyond the native record of Ken McKay, but was denied by the wind at
2.8. ''But I will have another shot at the record at the national
multi-event championships in Aberdeen next month,'' he promised.
With the country's best sprinters sidelined, or on UK duty, the men's
200m title went to Thames Valley's Cypren Edmonds, and the women's 400m
to Ireland's Stephanie McCann. But in the absence of Aileen McGillivray,
Sinead Dudgeon retained the women's 200m crown, by a considerable margin
from Dawn Flockhart.
Tom McKean safely negotiated his first race of the year in the 800m,
but fellow UK internationalist Brian Whittle suffered a rare defeat by a
fellow Scot, albeit only in the 400m heats.
Fifer James Beattie produced the fastest outdoor time by a Scot this
year, 47.73, to qualify in Whittle's heat.
The Ayr Seaforth man, in his first run of the season, recovering from
back injury, clocked 48.57. With defending champion Paul McBurney also
faster, at 47.66, Whittle will need to find something special today if
he is to become the most prolific winner of this title in the history of
Scottish athletics. With four victories he is tied with Ming Campbell,
now an MP, and title-winner from 1961-64.
Four-time steeplechase champion Graeme Croll, who has tried the
marathon this year, won a fine 10,000m ahead of Alaister Russell and
Bobby Quinn, and there was a championship-best in the pole vault, from
Janine Whitlock -- who claims Scottish grandparents -- and a national
record, with 2.85m.
The 200m fields were disappointing. Doug Walker and Ian Mackie, who
represented Scotland in the Commonwealth Games, failed to line up, and
McGillivray, Edinburgh Woollen Mill's record six-times winner of the
100m title, also is out of the championships.
Both of the men have hamstring problems. Pitreavie's Mackie will
tackle the 100m today, but Walker is not even prepared to risk racing in
a straight line.
McGillivray, likewise, will be missing today. A senior medallist in
the 100m every year since 1987, the 24-year-old Cumbernauld secretary
had surrendered the crown only once since 1988 -- when winning the
under-23 European Cup for Britain in 1992.
She planned to bid for the double here, but was unable to start the
200m, having torn adductor fibres in training. ''It's really sickening
when conditions are the best they have been for years,'' said
McGillivray, who still hopes to be fit for the AAA Championships.
McKean made his season's debut in the 800m heats, winning comfortably
in 1min 49.9sec, the fastest qualifier. He expects to go quicker in
today's final, where his main rival will be Gary Brown.

THE West Indies were full of complaints after England bowled
themselves back into the second Cornhill Test at Lord's yesterday.
On Thursday, West Indies coach Andy Roberts spoke well of the Lord's
wicket and was confident of getting 500 on it.
But yesterday he slammed the surface as ''one of the worst I've seen
in England.''
Roberts, who was a groundsman in Antigua after his playing days were
over, said: ''If all the wickets in Test matches are like this someone
may get hurt.
''It was different today than it was on the first day. The bounce was
uneven, it was up and down.
''I'm not worried for my players. I am fearful for the game of
cricket. It was under-prepared, it was too dry, and there was not enough
water put on it.
''I would not expect any pitch in the world to be like that for Test
cricket.''
Evidently, the pitch for the second game of this Cornhill series --
which West Indies lead 1-0 -- had not been watered for eight days.
Roberts added: ''But I am confident we are going to get a lead, and I
am confident that we are going to win it.''
MCC secretary Roger Knight was shocked to hear Roberts' criticism of
the pitch.
''I think it has produced two good days' cricket,'' he said. ''And
no-one has said anything to me other than that.
''There is a bit in it for the bowlers but I find it hard to
understand Andy's comments.''
England manager Ray Illingworth added: ''If the pitch stays as it is
for the rest of the match then we won't have any complaints.''
Not surprisingly Angus Fraser, England's bowler of the day, had no
complaints about the 22-yard stretch of turf well known to him from his
Middlesex connection.
Fraser said: ''I am not complaining about it. It's a bit two-paced and
batsmen cannot play with confidence.
''We were disciplined and made them work for their runs and waited for
things to happen.''
Fraser's vital capture of Brian Lara's wicket was his 100th in Test
cricket. He is the thirty-second England player to achieve the feat.
''It was a nice one to get. Remember, when he got his world record in
Antigua against us, I bowled at him for two days.
''The first hour tomorrow will be crucial. If we get them out for
another 30 to 40 runs, we will have an advantage.
''But if they get close or even get a lead, it will all depend on how
we play in our second innings. The wicket is not going to get easier.''
Fraser's figures of 20-9-37-3 left West Indies still 74 behind at 209
for six.
Peter Martin, Darren Gough and debut maker Dominic Cork all played
important roles but Fraser was undeniably the star of this show.
Slipped into last winter's Ashes party as an afterthought when Martin
McCague broke down and made twelfth man for this summer's first Test at
Headingley, the Middlesex seamer had a few points to prove.
And he proved them beyond question, showing stamina and skill in equal
measure during three spells from the Nursery End that challenged every
West Indian batsman to the limit.
Having been bowled out for just 283, an English first-innings lead
seemed out of the question. But if Mike Atherton's fired up attack can
carry on in the same vein then an absorbing second Cornhill Test could
tilt their way. Scoreboard:

SUSAN MacDonald, the Scotland striker, may have lost the prospect of a
medal at the European Women's Hockey Nations' Cup in Amsterdam, but the
Western Klick Photopoint player is in line to be the tournament's top
goal-scorer.
MacDonald opened Scotland's account in the 3-0 defeat of France and
had a hand in the other goals, a result which assured Scotland of
playing off for fifth place today against Russia, and of automatic
qualification to the 1999 finals at Hurth in Germany.
Wendy Fraser was fouled in 16 minutes and MacDonald did the needful
from the penalty. In 42 minutes, MacDonald spreadeagled the defence and
Diane Renilson hit the target from a penalty corner. Susan Gilmour
scored the third.
Spain, who denied Scotland a place in the semi-finals with a 1-0
victory on Sunday, yesterday ended England's hopes of retaining the
title. Results:
Places 5 to 8 -- Russia 4, Ireland 0; Scotland 3, France 0.
Semi-finals -- Spain 3, England 1; Holland 2, Germany 1.
* SCOTLAND'S men lost 1-0 to Ireland in the opening match of the Four
Nations Tournament last night in Lisburn. Marty Sloan scored the goal
from a twentieth- minute penalty corner.
In the opening game Spain beat USA 4-1.

BEALE Dobie, the market maker in traded endowment policies, has opened
for business in Scotland with a branch in Woodlands Terrace, Glasgow.
The office will offer a one-stop service for financial advisers and
private policyholders wanting to sell or buy with-profit policies.
Typically sellers can realise more than through surrendering their
policies. Beale Dobie believes people are losing an average of #1000 by
surrending rather than selling. Acceptable policies have to have a
surrender value of at least #2000 and have been in force for a minimum
of a quarter of their term.
STALWART Assurance has set up shop in Glasgow for the sale of its safe
home income plan. This provides a monthly annuity in exchange for a
share of the capital value of the customer's home, which is recouped
when he or she dies or sells the property. The plan is available for
single people over 65 and for married couples where both are 70 or over.
Minimum home value is #40,000.
CITY of London Unit Trust Managers is launching its Emerging Asia
Country Trust which will invest in closed-end funds (the equivalent of
investment trusts) which in turn invest in the region. There are a
variety of such funds and they often sell at a discount to asset value,
providing extra scope for capital appreciation.
There will be no initial charge on units purchased direct from the
company until July 31. The 1.5% annual management charge will also apply
from that date. Minimum investment is #1000. Since its launch in 1991,
City of London's similar Emerging Markets Country Trust has been the top
performing fund in its sector.
THE latest book in the Allied Dunbar personal finance series is
entitled ''Don't Pay Too Much Inheritance Tax'' and explains what can be
done to reduce the burden of this tax.
SKIPTON Building Society has withdrawn its two-year fixed rate
mortgage and reduced the rate on its three and five-year fixes to 7.49%
and 8.25% respectively.

BILLY Schwer gave Bruno Rabanales a five-round beating at York Hall,
Bethnal Green last night -- but officially beat the Mexican because of a
new British Boxing rule.
Rabanales was disqualified by referee Larry O'Connell after 25 seconds
of round six after his gumshield had fallen out half-a-dozen times.
Last month, a new regulation was placed in the Board of Control's rule
book stating that fighters must wear a properly fitting gum shield.
But the Mexican could not comply with this rule, the mouthpiece kept
dropping out -- and O'Connell judged in the end that his action was
intentional and pulled him out of the fight for ''persistently
infringing the rules''.
The verdict took some of the shine off Schwer's fine performance. The
Commonwealth champion from Luton completely dominated the bout until its
unusual conclusion.
He put his punches together in threes and fours, rarely wasting a blow
and Rabanales was obliged to just soak up the punishment.

THE holy grail for most investors is achieving the right blend of risk
and reward so they can enjoy healthy investment profits without enduring
too many sleepless nights. Corporate bond personal equity plans have
been hailed as one way to achieve that aim, and sales of the new-style
plans have been estimated at up to #6000m a year. They should offer
investors higher income than existing equity-linked PEPs, but with a
lower level of investment risk.
But the long-awaited launch of corporate bond PEPs due in just over a
week could turn out to be a very damp squib thanks to dithering and
confusion at the Inland Revenue. The Revenue has still to publish
detailed rules governing the new PEPs. These are now expected at the end
of this month, just a few days before the first corporate bond PEPs are
due to go on sale.
What is worse is that investment managers are still not sure how
Government proposals to tax profits on company bonds and Government
gilt-edged stocks will affect the new PEPs.
Corporate bond PEPs were expected to be so appealing to income-hungry
investors because the managers had hoped to offer tax-free returns as
high as 9% at a time when building society accounts are struggling to
break the 7% barrier even before tax. Now managers fear that proposals
to tax the profits fund managers make from gilts and bonds as income
will lower the returns on these new-style unit trusts even if they are
held within a tax-free PEP.
Before the announcement in last year's Budget that PEPs would be
allowed to invest in company bonds and preference shares, investments
had had to be mainly in Ordinary UK or EU shares -- either directly,
with investors backing their own hunches, or through managed funds such
as unit trusts, where investors leave the buying and selling decisions
to the managers.
Over the long run an investment in shares should do better than simply
leaving the money in a building society. The problem is that older
investors in particular may not be able to wait five, 10 or perhaps 20
years for results or accept the possibility of short-term falls in the
value of their capital.
That is why allowing PEPs to invest in company bonds appeared to offer
such a boost to both investors and the investment industry. A company
bonds is basically an IOU -- an agreement to repay the investor a fixed
rate of interest over a specified term and to repay the original sum
invested in full after an agreed period.
The interest rates are higher than building society or bank accounts
because these IOUs are more risky -- the company may go bust and not be
able to keep its promise to repay, and the price of the IOUs will go up
and down in line with market demand. This is why most interested
investors will entrust their money to a professional fund manager and
spread it widely so the element of risk can be reduced.
A dozen or so unit trust managers are already known to be planning a
corporate bond PEP launch as soon as they can. Latest to join the list
is Scottish Amicable. But most are putting their plans on ice while the
bond tax wrinkles are ironed out.
Scottish Amicable's new personal equity plan will allow investors to
choose between 13 different unit trusts once the tax complications
concerning company bond plans have been dealt with. It has appointed two
external fund managers -- JP Morgan in the US and Nikko in Japan -- to
look after two new ''global balanced'' funds.
''We believe investors should be spreading their investments
internationally,'' says Gavin Stewart at Scottish Amicable. ''They buy
their goods worldwide so their investments should be worldwide as well.
These new funds give investors the chance to diversify the management of
their assets too, with some being managed from the UK and some from the
US or Japan where the managers may have a very different perspective.''
The appointment of outside investment managers for some of its funds
may enable Scottish Amicable to make the most of international
investments, but it does not come cheap for investors. Charges are at
the top end of the range usually associated with unit trust PEPs at
5.25% initially and 1.5% annually, except for investors who opt for the
US managed trust where the yearly charge rises to 1.75%.
AT those charges, a #6000 investment in Scottish Amicable's new
corporate bond PEP would provide a yearly income of #398 assuming a
return of 8.75%. That compares with #464 from the current biggest gilt
and fixed-interest trust (from Barclays). This will become Barclays new
corporate bond PEP as soon as the rules allow and charges only 3.25%
initially and 0.75% yearly.
''Scottish Amicable was one of the first companies originally to
launch a PEP but it hasn't done particularly well for investors,'' says
Noel Valerio, an independent financial adviser at Glasgow's Money
Managers. ''There are already managers with strong track records in the
specialist areas the company is now targeting -- like Perpetual and
Morgan Grenfell -- and we will need to see some good performance from
Scottish Amicable before we see any reason to move investors into its
funds.''
Moves by insurance companies to establish separate investment
management teams for PEPs may become more common as they fight for
survival. Concerns over the way both pensions and endowment policies
have been sold in the past and the growing popularity of more flexible
equity-linked investments such as PEPs have led to dramatic falls in the
sales of long-term life and pension products.
And traditional insurance companies may be forced to take drastic
steps if they are to produce the kind of short-term investment
performance the public wants to see.

Allergic reactions are something of a sensitive subject, but as Joe
Donnelly discovers, they were initially designed to protect us.
BRITISH bioscientists have discovered new evidence about what causes
allergies, suffered by 30 per cent of the world's population. Dr Birgit
Helm at Sheffield Uni came up with the new theory into the causes of
allergies when she and her team were investigating a molecular
interaction during an allergic response. Results from the lab show that
allergens, compounds that cause allergies, interact directly with cells
of the immune system in quite a novel way.
The assay system for measuring molecular interaction has the potential
for monitoring a patient's sensitivity to particular substances and
could provide new therapeutic treatments.
Allergies are unwanted immune responses and develop when an initial
exposure to a substance triggers production of antibodies in the immune
system. These bind to the membranes of special cells which makes them
sensitive to the next exposure to the substance. This in turn causes the
release of substances like histamine which produces the sneezes and
streaming eyes of hay-fever.
Apart from hay-fever, common reactions are food allergies or skin
rashes but in severe cases when breathing is obstructed and blood
pressure plummets -- in catastrophic and fortunately rare reactions to
peanuts or bee stings for instance -- death can occur within minutes.
Birgit Helm's group grew their own colony of house dust mites, a
common cause of allergic reactions, and found that the bug's droppings
triggered the sensitivity in the immune cells. This shows that a range
of allergens trigger the response in the immune system.
The Sheffield team believe that the allergic response, which caused
painful misery to millions evolved to protect humans from worms and
parasites. Modern living may have turned that advantage against humans
because the incidence of allergies is increasing.
Dr Helm thinks environmental factors may be important. She has found
that reactive oxides like those found in car exhaust fumes can trigger
immune cells in a similar fashion. The new assay system will allow
closer examination of precisely who is allergic to what and why.
Hopefully the next step is to find a way of preventing the allergic
response altogether, bringing relief to millions, so that when the
wheezing and sneezing ends, we really will say . . . Bless You!
* ONLY a couple of weeks back Frontiers told how scientists had
discovered, about two centuries behind Scots mothers, that fish oil was
good for you. Now we can reveal that the Medical Research Council has
discovered another brand new beneficial substance . . . orange juice.
They believe O J -- the drink and not the trial -- can keep strokes at
bay.
Researchers at the MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit carried out a
study of a large group of elderly folk who had taken part in a
nutritional study more than 20 years ago in the early seventies. The
then DHSS study measured the diet of 700 people for a week.
Two decades later, researchers found that 643 in the group had died,
but analysis of deaths showed that people with higher levels of vitamin
C -- found in citric juices -- had half the risk of dying from strokes
compared to those on low C.
The study had not looked into how vitamin C helps cut stroke risks,
but M R C scientists believe it contains antioxidant properties
important in reducing the tendency of cholestorol and other fats to
block up and cause hardening of the arteries.
Dr Christopher Martyn said: ''Our research suggests that older people
should be eating a diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables. The
discovery of the link offers the possibility of a safe and
straightforward way for the elderly to reduce the risk of stroke.''
Remember what we said about cod liver oil and the orange juice? You
read it here first!
Those who have read this carefully will note that the vast majority of
the elderly folk in the survey didn't actually survive. They just didn't
die of strokes.

Gillies and Billy Mackinnon grew up in Glasgow during the sixties. Bob
Flynn discovers their latest movie, written via fax machine, is full of
memories of a violent era
A FEW weeks ago in May, two Scottish film directors returned home in
dramatically differing circumstances. One was Michael Caton Jones, with
a #1m PR juggernaut of tartantry centred on the Rob Roy party in
Edinburgh, a weekend of Highland Virtual Reality for his $25m
cowboys-in-kilts epic. The other was Gillies Mackinnon, fellow-student
with Caton Jones at the National Film School. But while the fawning
phalanx of international journalists were being bused to Gleneagles for
ceilidhs and even more free whisky, Mackinnon was wrapping the filming
of his long cherished project about late sixties Glasgow on a total
budget which amounted to less than the Edinburgh bash.
More than two years ago I was in Mackinnon's London kitchen, ostenibly
to talk about his latest Irish-based, American-backed film, The
Playboys. But he couldn't stop talking about his idea for a film set in
his home town of Glasgow which had been hatched by him and his brother,
Billy.
Billy Mackinnon was as far flung as it is possible to be, having made
his home in Australia where he worked with Jane Campion, co-producing
her first feature, Sweetie, and was at that point script editing a
strange-sounding thing called The Piano.
I had my unspoken doubts, the long-distance collaboration between
brothers seemed impractical, even though they had been faxing.
''I'm really pleased I'm doing this,'' says Gillies Mackinnon with a
grin. ''I dream about this story every night in a strange obtuse way. I
can't doze off without dreaming of the bloody film. There's no peace.
It's amazing how much it means to you when you spend years getting a
film like this together, especially when it was written by fax.''
The extraordinary process of the long-distance brotherly
script-writing was heightened by the fact that both Mackinnons drew on
their own past to create the world of Easterhouse (to be renamed). When
the summer of love became the exact opposite, a period of their lives
began haunting them since they left Glasgow in the early seventies,
eventually finding themselves involved in film-making at opposite ends
of the world. Gillies took the classic route through art school to the
National Film School where he drew attention with his graduation film,
Passing Glory, one of the best British short films in existence. He then
directed Jimmy (Cracker, Priest) McGovern's first full screenplay,
Needle, moving on to The Conquest of the South Pole, the award-winning
The Grass Arena and The Playboys starring Albert Finney.
Meanwhile, Billy spent 10 years ''drifting on a kind of hippy trail''
before finding Australia and Jane Campion. Both agreed they were ''glad
to leave'' the Glasgow of their youth, but obviously Glasgow did not
leave them .
''The film is set in 1968, when you had the Paris riots, the Czech
spring, the Tet offensive,'' says Billy. ''Globally it was an amazing
time, and I think it caused a restlessness and a tension that was
realised in Glasgow by gang violence, with all the elaborate rituals and
fashions that went with it.
''So the film is about that time, and about kids in a family who want
to find a way out of the violence. It was the background for a lot of
working class kids at that time, it was inescapable.''
The film revolves round the lives of three McGrath brothers with the
youngest, Lex, played by 13-year-old Iain Robertson, the unruly central
character who is precariously balanced between the opposing influences
of his older brothers, budding artist Alan, played by Josepth McFadden,
and temperamental gang member, Bobby, played by Steven Duffy. The choice
is between the creative world of the arts and the destructive world of
the cleaver and the knife.
Although both Mackinnons state that the film is not autobiographical,
the script is full of ''memories'' of their teenage years when they
lived ''on the border of Castlemilk and the Gorbals''.
''Easterhouse is two films really,'' says Gillies. ''We wanted to make
a film about violence and look at it squarely in the face, but we also
wanted to make something light and whimsical about a young boy. The
violence isn't the subject of the film, it's about getting over that
violence that surrounds the family. There are violent scenes but it's
not the ironic, spectacle violence you see a lot of, it hurts and there
are consequences. People bring a lot of assumptions to this type of film
but I hope they will see it is different, it's approached in an unusual
way.''
The filming proved to be a strange experience for the Mackinnon
brothers, using locations around Glasgow housing schemes and moving to
Murrayfield ice rink to film a pivotal gang fight where the blades
flashing across the ice are not skates, they realised their own past was
staring back at them into the lens. Billy says the experience has been
''spooky'' while Gillies had sudden, disconcerting flashbacks where
reality and fiction blurred.
Gillies adds: ''I remember going down Sauchiehall Street on a Saturday
night and it was like a beehive, there was this mad energy, boys had
money in their pockets and were going down town to drink and fight. It's
very laid back now by comparison. We just did this scene outside a dance
hall where we had a group of guys as the Tongs. I had to go and set
things up inside and I pushed my way through them, and they were
apologising and stepping aside and I suddenly felt the hair on the back
of my head standing on end because for one moment I thought, I'm pushing
through the Tongs. That was a very weird moment for me.''
Only Clare Higgins, who plays the exasperated mother of the three
adolescents, is a relatively recognisable film face among the young
unknowns. With the 50 extras acting as the rival gangs alongside the
central triumvirate of brothers, the film is filled with new discoveries
which Gillies Mackinnon has found inspirational.
''We've got two guys playing the gang leaders, Kevin McKidd and Gary
Sweeney, and they are really rising to the parts. That's a very
difficult thing to do, you've got to capture that manic charisma that
made these guys gang leaders. A lot of them weren't idiots. I remember
meeting one of them at the time and having a very intelligent
conversation before he pulled a bayonet out of his pocket and said he
was going down to the Locarno to get the Tongs.''
But the script suggests, thankfully, that Easterhouse is more The
Bicycle Thieves than Just A Boys' Game, with a distinctly European feel
that is closer to Visconti than McDougall.
This is a long way from Hollywood, where Gillies directed Steve
Martin's latest film A Simple Twist Of Fate, and the Oscars where The
Piano scooped the pool, but the brothers seem comfortable in all
situations. ''I don't come back with any horror stories from
Hollywood,'' says Gillies Mackinnon. ''Steve Martin asked me to direct
the film and backed me all the way. I found him to be completely fair
and it was a very positive relationship, and I mean that.'' It was
difficult for this reporter to believe either Mackinnon would be
interested in returning home to Glasgow with a low-budget film set among
the housing schemes of their youth after their respective successes.
I was wrong. I had underestimated the obsessive nature and the
integrity of the Mackinnons. ''Easterhouse is something that has
preoccupied me for a long time and it's equally as important to me as
working in Hollywood. During the filming, I've discovered just how much
it means to me. It has been a very strange and powerful experience to go
back into a time that was my formative years and re-examine it. To bring
that back and recreate it is something that shakes you,'' said Gillies.

* My daughter is due to get married in a month's time and I have just
heard a horror story from a friend about a wedding which was ruined by
the firm organising the reception going bust a day or two before the big
day. I am going to have nightmares about something similar happening to
us. Is there any straightforward insurance I can obtain against
disasters happening? What about the weather?
* You can indeed find insurance cover for wedding day disasters and
for a modest price too. Typically its pays out for a cancelled wedding
reception, the hire of clothes and cars should the whole wedding have to
be postponed, and for official photographs to be retaken should they
turn out to the spoilt. Whether you would be able to re-assemble
everyone is another matter.
A number of insurance companies offer such cover, including Cornhill,
Norwich Union and Ecclesiastical. It is also possible to insure against
wet weather. Don't forget to check that the wedding presents will also
be covered. Cancellation has to be for a genuine reason. What you can't
insure against is the bride or groom or both having second thoughts
about tying the knot.
* On May 1, 1991 I invested #6000, less commission and charges, with
Ivory and Sime's PEP International Income Growth (British Assets Trust).
I then invested an additional #6000, less commission and charges, on
January 20, 1993. Due to a reorganisation of shares in December 1994 I
now hold 12,474 British Assets Trust plc shares and 2223 British Assets
Growth shares. At March 31 the value of these totalled #12,025.30.
I know this should be looked on as a long-term investment, but I still
do not think this has performed very well. I realise there has been a
reorganisation within the company and wondered if I should persevere or
consider reinvesting elsewhere.
* The good news is that your holding of the two classes of British
Assets shares is currently worth around #12,600. The bad news is that
your investment has significantly under-performed financial markets.
This has been recognised by Ivory and Sime. Hence the reorganisation
last year, but it remains to be seen if a superior performance will be
achieved.
Since May 1991 the FTSE-100 share index has increased in value by a
third and since January 1993 by over 20%. Notwithstanding your point
about it being a long-term investment, we think you should give serious
consideration to disposing of part of your holding, say half, and
reinvesting the proceeds elsewhere.
You could hardly be blamed for contemplating more radical action and
disposing of the lot. There are plenty of investment trusts with much
stronger capital performances for you to consider.
But if you sell out completely don't make the same mistake again of
putting all your eggs in one basket. If necessary you should be able to
transfer your investments to another plan manager before disposing of
them so that you can preserve the integrity of your PEPs, even if you do
not like the underlying investment.
* I have eight years of teaching service and approximately three years
in temporary service with the region. Previous to this I raised my five
children until the youngest was school age.
Like many others I am unsure of my position as regards my pension and
the best way to make up for ''lost'' years. I am also in the likely
position in the near future of separating from my husband to whom I have
been married for 21 years. I want nothing more than I am entitled to
once we separate. Three of my children are at university and receive
very little in grants. The other two are still at school. Could you
please advise me how best I can compensate for these lost years?
* There are three ways to improve your pension position: making extra
payments to make up for the missing contribution years, investing
through the scheme's additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme or
through a freestanding AVC.
The latter can be ruled out because its expenses make it
uncompetitive. Investing in an AVC means making contributions out of
gross income, usually to a unit-trust kind of investment or possibly a
with-profits endowment type. The fund grows over the years and is used
to buy an additional pension on retirement. The amount depends on how
well the investment performs so it cannot be predicted in advance.
Buying added years within the pension scheme does appear expensive
when you get the figures from the administrator, but you have to
remember the security the scheme provides. You are sure you will receive
a pension of a certain proportion of final salary and that the pension
in payment will keep pace with inflation. This certainty is worth paying
for.
* I have recently been widowed and am trying hard to understand stocks
and shares. I seem to have bits and pieces of many, not amounting to
much in total. When everything is finally sorted out by the solicitor I
will probably sell the lot -- and go on a cruise.
I would like advice about these Government stocks: #200 of 3[1/2]%
Conversion, #500 2[1/2]% Treasury, 5[1/2]% National Savings bought 1978,
#300 4% Consolidated and #400 3[1/2]% War Loan. They are all in my name.
I must have inherited them, as I certainly would not have purchased
them. I think I would like them to be premium bonds.
My bank has not been at all helpful and I hesitate to ask their
advice. They have omitted to pay my council tax, which is paid by direct
debit, for three months but have charged to my account a Marks &amp; Spencer
direct debit for #647. The excuse was a wrong name.
I have not much capital, not really enough to inquire through your
financial pages on Saturday. If I had that amount I would not need
advice. As you will have guessed I am elderly.
* First of all we welcome questions from everyone, however much
capital they have. With the exception of the National Savings holding,
the investments are all of undated Government stock whose price
fluctuates according to the ups and downs in interest rates.
Not so long ago they stood at little more than half their present
values. They are currently worth about #580. The National Savings
product is presumably a National Savings certificate, on which interest
is still being paid, albeit at a reduced rate. You should cash it in and
invest elsewhere for a better return. The stocks are worth about #580 in
aggregate, unfortunately not enough to pay for even a modest cruise.
There is little point holding on to them.
As for your unhelpful bank, it is not too difficult to change to
another and you should find a rival only too happy to take a disgruntled
customer from a competitor.
* A friend of mine has recently been diagnosed as having Aids. I know
he has a number of life insurance policies and I would like to inquire
if there are any companies prepared to buy such policies from him,
recouping their money from the policies on his inevitable death. He has
no dependants that I know of and it does seem unfortunate that he cannot
use the resources locked up in these policies while he is still able to.
* You do not say what kind of insurance policies. If they include a
with-profits endowment policy there is no difficulty in turning it into
cash. It can be surrendered or sold to one of the specialist buyers of
such policies.
Selling term assurance policies is more unusual, though there is an
non-profit-making organisation, Life Benefit Resources Foundation (0800
451333), which may be able to help. It buys policies where the life
expectancy of the policyholder is two years or less. The proportion of
the sum assured which is payable varies according to the individual
circumstances but is usually well over 50%.
* Please explain the situation where although the amount of my income
is less than the limit of #14,600 for age allowance purposes, I do not
qualify for the extra allowance. It seems to me that in arriving at the
amount of my total income the tax inspector adds tax paid on bank and
building society interest, but if this is the case, surely I am being
penalised twice on my investment income.
* Banks and building societies usually deduct tax at basic rate from
interest before it is paid to you. In working out your total income for
tax purposes, you must calculate it by adding together all your income
before tax is deducted, that is gross income. Age allowance is available
in full if your gross income does not exceed #14,600. If it does, the
allowance is scaled back by half of any excess until the normal
allowances are reached.
This does not mean you are being taxed twice on your investment
income. Full credit for tax deducted at source is given when calculating
your tax liability and you would only suffer further tax if you were due
to pay at the higher rate. Even then, the amount of tax is deducted from
the higher rate charge so that the amount due is the difference only.
* I have been a resident in the UK for many years and most of my
income comes from here. I have, however, a French state pension which is
payed into a bank account in France and I have paid tax there on this
pension and on the bank interest. I have never brought any of this
income into the UK, but I have been told that I should still declare it
on my UK tax return. If this is correct, will I also pay UK tax on it?
* As you are resident in the UK you are liable to tax on both the
French state pension and bank interest, and hence you must declare the
amount taxable on your UK tax return. It is probable that you are not
due to pay French tax on your pension or interest under the terms of the
Double Tax Treaty, and you should consult an international tax adviser
on how to reclaim this from the French authorities.
The amount subject to UK tax depends on whether you are domiciled, as
well as resident, in the UK. If you are, you will be liable to UK tax on
90% of the French pension and the full amount of the bank interest. If
you have retained domicile in France, you will be liable to UK tax on
the amount of the pension brought into the UK.
The question of tax domicile is highly technical and depends on where
your parents were born, where you live and what your future intentions
are. You should again seek professional advice on your current status
and agree it with the Inland Revenue.
If any of your income is taxable in both countries, the UK will give
you relief for French tax suffered.

THE City was on tenterhooks yesterday as it watched the political
drama in the Conservative Party unfolding and key data from Germany and
the US upset bond markets.
The big fear in the Square Mile is that John Major's gamble will
backfire and that he scrapes home, but ends up an emasculated leader.
There is talk that the loyalty of large numbers of backbenchers cannot
be relied upon because they fear losing their seats at the General
Election.
By contrast if the Prime Minister wins a decisive victory or is
replaced by a leader who can unite the Conservative Party behind him,
financial markets will benefit from the ending of internecine strife and
the attendant political uncertainty.
One special worry is that a weakened Government may be tempted to
relax its tight fiscal stance which would hit the gilt-edged market. The
Bank of England is set to auction #2500m of 8.5% Treasury 2005 on
Thursday morning, a couple hours before the deadline for nominations in
the leadership battle.
On Wednesday the Treasury is due to publish its mid-summer economic
update. The betting is that it will cut the growth forecast from 3.25%
to 3% and increase its fourth-quarter inflation forecast from 2.5% to
2.75%.
Markets would be more sensitive to an upward revision to the Budget
forecast of a #21.5bn Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in the current
fiscal year. Slower growth would hit revenues.
Mr Major's announcement on Thursday night came too late to have much
immediate impact on financial markets. An air of calm prevailed for an
hour or two yesterday morning, but disclosure of the long-planned
retirement of Douglas Hurd soon upset the applecart.
It was a reminder of just how fluid and uncertain the political
situation had become. Uncertainty tends to paralyse investors. Yesterday
the big institutions were keeping their powder dry waiting for the
situation to clarify itself.
The pound had a surprisingly good day recovering some ground against
the dollar but dropping back against the German mark. Its trade weighted
index declined just 0.1 to 84.0.
So far this year sterling has lost more than 5% of its international
value, mainly on the back of the sharp drop by the dollar against
safe-haven currencies such as the mark and the Japanese yen.
The pound's fall from grace has been regularly aggravated by the
Government's political difficulties, especially over Europe. Yesterday,
however, there was no bloodbath on the foreign markets. Sterling fell
0.75 pfennigs to DM2.2257, but gained 0.63 cents to $1.6048.
Gilts suffered badly losing about one-and-a-quarter points, but this
was mainly because of poor inflation figures in Germany which put paid
to hopes of a cut in Bundesbank interest rates before the summer recess.
Bunds sustained losses of about a point.
Weakness in bond markets invariably transmits itself to equity
markets. The FTSE-100 share index fell 24.4 points to 3379.4 as it had
to contend with political shockwaves at home and economic ones abroad.
Hopes that it would be able to build on its recent rally and
consolidate above 3400 were frustrated. On Thursday it broke through
3400 for the first time since February 17 last year.
The UK market has been feeding off Wall Street's strength and the less
hostile interest rate environment that has emerged since the Chancellor
of the Exchequer rebuffed the Governor of the Bank of England on May 5.
However, yesterday's setback curtailed the Footsie's advance to just 13
points over the week.
Across the Atlantic, Wall Street was upset by an unexpected rise of
2.5% in durable goods orders. The Dow-Jones index was in negative
territory throughout London trading.
The durable goods orders were in marked contrast to the general run of
US figures which have strongly suggested that the American ecomony has
come off the boil. Indeed on Wednesday Alan Greenspan, the chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, conceded the possibility of a downturn in
activity in the current quarter.
Wall Street has been propelled higher by growing hopes of a cut in US
interest rates, ending a long run of hikes since February of last year.
The Federal Open Market Committee is due to meet on July 5 and 6,
immediately after the first-round voting for the Conservative Party
leadership. Its decision on US interest rates may have a bigger impact
on UK markets than the outcome of the Conservative Party's leadership
contest.
James Capel's Gwyn Hacche thinks that a quarter-point cut in
short-term US rates is on the cards. Nor has he given up hope of lower
German rates. Higher oil prices were the main factor behind the jump in
inflation, but it is likely that these will be reversed after the
summer, leaving the Bundesbank free to trim its rates.

SCOTTISH Ford dealer Alexanders Holdings has dipped into the red after
selling off used car stocks cheaply in a difficult market.
Alexanders made a pre-tax loss of #304,000 during the six months to
March 30, after a profit of #406,000 in the first half of 1994, and its
shares fell 2p to 17p.
''We concentrated on used car sales during the period because it was
necessary for us to manage down our used car stocks,'' said finance
director Michael Porter.
Second-hand car sales soared 37% to 2600 vehicles during the six-month
period despite the poor trading conditions. But sales of new cars fell
5% to 1900 units and turnover on Alexanders' continuing business slipped
9% to #47.8m.
Mr Porter said the de-stocking process was now complete and Alexanders
was in a strong position to take advantage of the summer peak in new car
sales after 1996 registration letters are added to number plates in
August.
He predicted a return to profit in the second half of the financial
year, but acknowledged that full-year pre-tax profits would be well
short of the #935,000 achieved in 1994.
Alexanders, which is 67% owned by Polish-born Aleksandra Clayton, owns
Ford dealerships in Edinburgh, Greenock, Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch.
But expansion into England led the company to transfer its management
headquarters to London three years ago.
Alexanders owns a Ford dealership in Northampton and last year it
diversified away from Ford by purchasing Metheringham Car Sales in
Lincoln, which sells Nissan, Mazda, Jeep and Hyundai.
This new subsidiary contributed #4.4m to group sales in the first half
of the current financial year, but overall turnover was flat at #52.3m,
reflecting a decline in real terms.
As usual, Alexanders paid no interim dividend.
The company's #1.4m purchase of Metheringham in October brought with
it #2.5m of additional debt which boosted gearing to 82% of shareholder
funds at the end of March from 35% a year earlier.
The sale of development land at South Gyle in Edinburgh for just over
#1m on June 20 has since reduced gearing to less than 70%.
But Mr Porter said Alexanders' debts of just under #6m were still too
high for the group to contemplate further acquisitions in the near
future.

<HEADLINE>WPP waters down Sorrell's package</HEADLINE>

ADVERTISING giant WPP is confident its revised incentive package for
chief executive Martin Sorrell will be approved by institutional
shareholders. They had objected to the original plan which could have
netted Mr Sorrell some #31m if various criteria had been met.
The revised proposals could still result in him receiving a maximum of
#28.5m, though the performance targets which have to be achieved have
been made tighter. The minimum he can get is #5.3m.
''We're very confident now, given our own count of the votes and what
we've been told by the institutions,'' declared WPP director of human
resources Brian Brooks who is the only executive member of the
remuneration committee, the other members being non-executive.
A number of major institutional shareholders indicated to WPP that
they would vote against the original plan, including Fleming Investment
Management, Norwich Union and Legal &amp; General.
Yesterday, Mr Brooks said Fleming and the Post Office and BT pension
funds, with about 10% of the votes, had agreed to back the revised plan.
The new proposals eliminate the ''phantom'' options on 2,721,000
shares which were not performance-related. Instead, Mr Sorrell will
qualify for three awards each equivalent to 585,000 shares if WPP shares
exceed 230p, 265p and 304p respectively for a period of at least 60 days
in the next five years and if over this period earnings per share have
increased by the rate of inflation plus one percentage point. These
conditions will also apply to the other 4,700,000 ''performance'' shares
which remain in place. WPP shares currently stand at 121p.
The generous incentive package, though subject to demanding
performance targets, was put in place, according to WPP, in order to be
competitive with remuneration deals in similar American multi-agency
holding companies such as Interpublic and Omnicom.
Other US companies also have similar agreements with top executives
and WPP was not expecting any trouble with its American shareholders who
have over 30% of the equity. At one stage WPP was apparently considering
relocating itself to the US.
WPP's profits are recovering rapidly, reflecting the pick-up in the US
and European economies and tight control over costs which is pushing
margins higher. Analysts reckon the performance targets are tough but
just about achievable if the trading background remains reasonably
favourable.

FOR a moment the hills were alive to the sound of music, as the
cherubic youngster playing St Michael puffed at his toy trumpet in this
performance by Process Ten28, the sixth instalment of director Kenneth
Davidson's ambitious adaptation of James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake.
Apart from that off-tune, not-so-celestial volley, the production was
a silent affair, Davidson and actor Tam Dean Burn eschewing dialogue in
their interpretation of Joyce's verbose text.
It might have been a dumb show but the event wasn't. Castlemilk was
abuzz with wonder, and Tam Dean Burn's mesmeric progress up the Cathkin
Brae, accompanied by a magnificent donkey and St Michael, was
considerably enlivened by packs of snickering children.
Davidson certainly promoted lively discussion. When the procession
reached the stage installation at the top of the hill, Burn parked the
donkey (it showed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for treading the
boards), mounted the bunting-strewn podium, unpacked his suitcase, and
arranged some apples, oysters, and a tiny pair of cymbals on to a
trestle-table. A fascinated tot immediately piped up: ''What's he doing,
dad?''
We were all as bewildered, although his thoughtful father thought it
might be some kind of fertility rite. ''He has a funny face!'' shrieked
the enraptured child. Too true. Burn did little more than drag the
donkey up the hill, but held the crowd enthralled throughout with a
series of grimaces, frowns, scowls and manic grins, exacerbating the
sense of slapstick which Davidson created with the ad hoc, free-wheeling
procession up the brae.
As an event it was a great success; an atmospheric and memorable
midsummer-night's madness.

THE reporting season for the regional electricity companies (RECs) of
England and Wales continues with East Midlands Electricity the latest
company to announce increased profits and plans to buy-back its shares.
In the year to end-March, the company increased its operating profit
by 13.7% to #207.9m. The number of electricity units distributed was
1.4% higher. The annual dividend was raised by 27.8% to 29p after a
final shareholders' payment of 20.4p.
However, the company stressed that customers were also benefiting from
the improved performance of the business with domestic electricity
prices reduced by 12% in real terms during the course of the past three
years.
The principal movements in the balance sheet reflected the impact of
the 85p per share special dividend paid to shareholders last Novemmber.
In total the special dividend involved a cash outflow of #232m.
Year-end net borrowings were #178.2m and gearing was 31.1% compared
with 0.3% a year earlier. Employee numbers fell by nearly 10% during the
year as a result of natural wastage and voluntary severance schemes.
Some RECs are busy diversifying, with varying degrees of success, into
unregulated activities. However, East Midlands intends to stick to its
knitting. Chairman Nigel Rudd said that the company remained committed
to concentrating on its core electricity business. ''It is our firm
belief that this focused approach represents the most effective way to
benefit customers and release shareholder value.''
At its annual general meeting in September the company intends to seek
authority to eliminate the 15% share ownership restriction which was put
in place at privatisation and to renew the authority to buy-back up to
10% of its own shares. In addition, the company intends to pass the
value of its 8.4% stake in the National Grid to shareholders and to
consider making a customer rebate, subject to satisfactory terms being
agreed with the other parties involved.
Following publication of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report
on Scottish Hydro-Electric, some City analysts have become more positive
on the electricity sector. East Midland Electricity, to which it acts as
corporate broker, is one of the preferred regional electricity stocks of
Smith New Court along with London, Norweb, Southern and Yorkshire. In
selecting stocks, Smith New Court has gone for those that are well
placed for the distribution review.
The criteria used for the risk assessment has been the sensitivity to
a uniform tightening and the risk of a differential price cut. Larger
RECs such as East Midlands tend to have higher profit margins, fewer
customers per share and lower prices and costs, making them less at risk
from a differential impact and a uniform tightening.
Shares in East Midlands Electricity dropped 9p to 669p where they
yield 5.4% amid some disappointment with the dividend increase.

DOWN in England, the letters continue to pour in to the Establishment
papers, detailing each ornithological sign of summer's arrival. In
Scotland, we don't use birdsong to suss out then spring's passed: you
know summer's arrived when you see youngsters with the sleeves of their
jumper tied round the waist carrying a half-empty bottle of Irn Bru;
summer's here when you see teachers with a smile on their face, looking
forward to an extended period of being paid for dothing nothing useful
(of course they're happy: now they know how good it feels to be a
lawyer); summer's here when Glasgow Man turns his thoughts to the great
outdoors, ie he drinks on the pavement outside the pub for half an hour.
More generally, another sign among the arts community that summer's
arrived is the day when the Edinburgh Festival Fringe programme flops
through the letter box.
Like news readers, this brochure seems to get thicker each year,
growing testament to the expansion of the Fringe into the
biggest-and-best part of the biggest-and-best arts festivals in the
world. Like the Fringe itself, the brochure is so crowded that, although
it's often quite difficult to find specific shows, you're always
stumbling into ones that will entertain, amuse, and irritate you, often
all at the same time.
There has been much debate in the past few years about the way the
Fringe has evolved. People (and when I say ''people'', I'm referring of
course to arty-farty tossers) have been complaining that there is too
much comedy at the Fringe, Campbell. Being a bit of a crusading type
(not so arty-farty, still a tosser), I was keen to have a closer look at
the composition of the Fringe, to see whether comedy was suffocating or
complementing it.
There is, admittedly, an awful lot of comedy, and a lot of it's awful.
More importantly, however, there's even more of everything else!
In the festival brochure, comedy listings and adverts take up 20
pages. Admittedly there are a lot of adverts for comedy shows throughout
the rest of the programme, but there is still a healthy contribution
from music, musicals, and opera (22 pages) and, more significantly,
theatre (a whopping 40 pages). I don't hear any complaints about
theatrical productions killing the Fringe. I await these stories with
interest. One of the main motivating factors for the rise of comedy can
be found in the accounts of any Fringe venue.
VAT accounts for one sixth of the ticket price. So before a line is
recited or a punchline delivered, the VAT man is guaranteed a
substantial amount of money. Of the other 82.5%, just under half will go
to the venue as rent (assuming you're lucky enough to be taken on by the
Gilded Balloon, or one of the other big venues) while the rest will, in
all probability, only just cover publicity (posters can cost all in
about #3 each, and frankly I've seen a student on a pub crawl stay up
longer than a Fringe poster), accommodation, travel, and subsistence for
three weeks.
Performers don't want to charge #6 for a one-hour show, but with the
people and organisations of Edinburgh lining their pockets, they have no
choice but to combine high-admission prices with low-budget shows.
Companies and individuals now have to go for shows that involve small
casts (preferably of one), no props, and no special effects.
In what kind of art form is such minimalism the norm? Comedy.
Just because there are lots of comedians around, don't go for a second
imagining that they will all be good. The two types of comedian to avoid
are:
The Pretty Boys. These posers, usually boast reviews where they are
described as having ''boyish good looks'', ie they look like students.
Their publicity picture shows them staring dreamily into space, trying
desperately to look young, handsome, and talented, with the world at
their feet. They think Blur will live forever, and their material
concentrates on musical trends and their experience of sex (ie lots of
lingerie-section-in-the-catalogue related humour).
The Pretty Boys detest mainstream comics, but would do a gameshow at
the drop of a hat. With so little to say for himself, he'll be doing one
sooner rather than later.
The Angst Boys. Angst Boy is an English phenomenon, more particularly,
a London one. One glance at his photo reveals all: he's one step up in
the irritation ratings from the Pretty Boy, and he's realised that he's
not very funny, not very smart, and not very nice. In trying hard to
make up for this, he confuses obtuseness for intelligence, sniping for
ribbing, and nit-picking for sensitivity.
This loser aims to be a cross between Earnest Hemingway and Morrissey,
his material a series of painful monologues, about how painful their
childhood was. Angst Boy's biggest error is confusing whinging
self-centredness for critical introspection. All his fragile soul needs
is a good kicking.
Looking at the blurbs of any of the comedy shows, you'd think that
every one of them was, individually, the saviour of British comedy.
Superlatives and exclamation marks are scattered round the pages like
swear words round a routine. Every act is ''the best in Britain this
decade!'', ''The finest comic I've ever witnessed!'', and the world
''genius!'' is used to describe everybody except the truly talented.
To the novice, the Fringe would appear to be a centre of comic
excellence. Don't get too down, because most of them are crap.
The Scottish contingent would never dream of falling into any of these
traps. Kay, Kiernan, MacCauley, Morton, Parrot, et al (in alphabetical
order) know that it's either funny or it's not. These guys always are.
But enough of comedy. What about the rest of the fest?
As far as theatre goes (all 40 pages of it) there's plenty to choose
from, but only three types of play. The ''Shakespeare In Inappropriate
Costume'' (first line in Hamlet done holding a motorbike helmet, etc),
the ''Gritty Working Class Tale'' (''ach, ah've been hittin' the boattle
e'er since Jackie goat TB in the trenches!''), and the Sexual/Political
Allegory dressed up as modern-day fairy story (''unemployment is a
cultural wasting disease, a bureaucratic Aids, you know?'').
In the evolutionary scale of art, revues are somewhere between
bacteria and plankton. To say they're always terrible really understates
how bad they are. The nadir usually involves medical students from
London hospitals. Festival medical revues are like outer space. It's
statistically probable that there is intelligent life there, but we
have, as yet, no direct evidence to support the notion.
Revue shows are what middle-class students do in the summer instead of
getting a real job.
What of the rest? Well, they're not really my bag. The programme has
five pages of dance And physical theatre listings and, as far as I'm
concerned, if a growth-retarded adolescent walking tiptoe on wooden
blocks can tell you anything about the human condition, then you're
welcome to it. The choice of musicals and operas looks OK but, again, if
I wanted to hear someone sing plaintive tosh in a foreign language, I'd
buy myself a Runrig LP.
Anyway, I'm just off to pen a classic play for the 96 Fringe --
they'll love it, it's a story of sexual awakening set in a thirties
Glasgow slum with the hero in Dutch national costume. Hey, it's art,
no-one said it had to be relevant.

THEY may not have expected to be flogged or keelhauled, but some of
the crew of the STS Lord Nelson came aboard at Glasgow's Yorkhill Quay
this week looking decidedly apprehensive.
Perhaps they could be forgiven. The 490-ton square-rigged sail
training ship is not the place where one might expect to find paraplegia
victims, the blind, or otherwise physically impaired.
Every time the Lord Nelson leaves port, as it did on its latest voyage
from the Clyde this week, it sails against the prevailing tide of
prejudice and preconception: that the harsh environment of life before
the mast would be perhaps the last with which the handicapped person can
cope.
But that, of course, is the point. When the vessel hoists its vast
acreage of 18 sails, it blows before a wind of change which forces the
majority to acknowledge that disabilty exists more in their minds than
in the bodies of the afflicted, for whom virtually anything is possible
and achievable, if only they can be given the chance.
''Those apprehensive faces have disappeared by the time the trip is
over,'' assures the master, John Fisher.
For the first time in their lives, many of those aboard are treated as
individuals and made to feel useful, rather than patronised. The aim is
to change the attitudes of other people, rather than operate a nautical
rehabilitation unit.
The Lord Nelson is owned and operated by The Jubilee Trust, a
registered charity established in 1978 with the aim of integrating the
able-bodied and physically handicapped by means of sailing a tall ship.
The 180-foot barque, of metal construction, has a permanent crew of
10, including a nurse, and for each trip takes on an additional crew of
40 who pay, on average, around #75 per day for the privilege.
Half of these are disabled, and up to eight may be confined to
wheelchairs. There are sufficient applications for there normally to be
a doctor on board. For a large number of the volunteers, it is their
first contact with the disabled.
The aim is to show ''that it is possible to walk tall with no legs,
and be very handy with no arms.''
The Lord Nelson is custom-built with flat decks and companionways,
toilets, and showers wide enough to take wheelchairs; powered lifts
between decks; speaking compass to allow those with visual impairment to
helm the ship; power-assisted steering to help those with restricted
movement; an induction loop system for those with hearing difficulties;
and eight specially large cabins to accommodate wheelchair users.
The crew of 40 is divided into four watches, half of each of which is
disabled, each physically handicapped person being paired with a buddy.
Perspectives on disability can shift rapidly when the wheelchair-bound
can function perfectly as a watch leader, but some big physical specimen
discovers that balancing on a thin rope 100 feet above deck in half a
gale can be totally disabling.
More than 10,000 paying crew have sailed on the Lord Nelson since her
launch, and the concept has worked so well that the trust now has a
second, similar ship, but built of wood, at the design stage. It will
cost #6.8m, but supporters can contribute to construction, from #5 for a
four-inch plank to #100 per metre, which carries the donor's name.
The youngest crew permitted is 16, while a man of 91 is, to date, the
oldest volunteer. People regularly give up their holidays, paying to
work long hours, sailing and buddying.
The Lord Nelson is currently on the third of five trips from Scottish
ports on a summer programme of 23 cruises. They are making a voyage
around the Hebrides, finishing on Thursday in Oban.
In winter the ship is based in the Canaries, and cruises from there.
Trips range from four to 11 days. The longest this summer -- already
over-subscribed -- is from Leith, accompanying, though not competing in,
the Tall Ships Race, which begins on July 18.
* IT is a matter of regret to the trust that they cannot accommodate
people with mental handicap or severe learning difficulties.
Coincidentally, however, 101 competitors in that category leave
tomorrow for the sporting contest of a lifetime: the UK team for the
Special Olympics in New Haven, Connecticut, from July 1 to 9.
The participants -- 15 of them from Strathclyde -- in 11 sports have
each had to raise around #1000 towards the cost. This includes the
youngest member of the whole British team, 12-year-old gymnast George
McBride.
The Special Olympics, hosted in Glasgow five years ago, is the world's
largest multi-sport event this year, with 6500 competitors from 139
countries.

BP will take account of public opinion when it comes to disposing of
its offshore oil platforms, chief executive designate John Browne said
yesterday.
The offshore industry is fearful that Shell's decision not to sink the
Brent Spar in the Atlantic has set a precedent which will make disposal
of any platform in this way impossible. It is thought about five
platforms will reach the end of their life by the year 2000.
But BP does not have to worry for another five years. ''For us this
issue does not arise until the next millenium,'' said Mr Browne. ''We're
going to use that time to listen, to talk, to take account of the view
of different parts of society that have a truly legitimate concern.''
He was speaking on publication of BP's annual review of world energy,
which noted that demand for energy outside the former Soviet Union rose
by 2.8% last year. The fastest growth came in Asia, where China is the
second-largest energy consumer behind the US.
World oil demand, excluding the former Soviet Union, increased by
3.2%, well above the trend rate of 2% seen over the last decade owing to
economic recovery and the strong growth seen in the Asian economies. Gas
demand was up 2.9%, being strongest in the more open markets of the US
and UK.
Mr Browne said the overall increase in demand was met without
difficulty, though trade was becoming more important. He considered
there was no cause for alarm even if consumption continued to rise at
1994's pace.
''Open liberal international trade should have no difficulty in
meeting the world's energy requirements,'' he said.

BARCLAYS Bank has halved its overdraft fee to #5 a month, switching it
from the most expensive of the High Street banks to the cheapest.
TSB charges #6 for an authorised overdraft, Midland #7, Lloyds #8 and
NatWest #9, although all but Lloyds charge a lower interest rate than
Barclays on the amount overdrawn.
In Scotland you could pay more for going into the red on an
interest-paying current account, but only if you are overdrawn by more
than #100. No fees or interest are normally levied on overdrafts below
this limit.
The Royal charges a flat fee of #10 per month in addition to interest
on all overdrafts over #100.
The Bank of Scotland levies an administration charge of #15 per month
on all interest-bearing current accounts that go into unauthorised
overdraft.
Clydesdale charges #30 per quarter on authorised overdrafts and #40
per quarter on unauthorised overdrafts above this amount.

TO merit an entry in Burke's Peerage, the blue-blood bible, one need
merely have been born of the right parents, and on the right side of the
blanket. One's name remains enshrined within its covers for life.
Devotees of athletics have only a marginally less weighty book of
worship, produced annually by the Association of Track and Field
Statisticians (ATFS). In addition to exhaustive statistical data on the
world's elite, this international reference tome features superstars'
biographies, country by country.
But entry is more exclusive than to Burke's. Performance is the sole
yardstick. Most nations have not one athlete who rates a mention.
A permanent fixture in the UK section since the 1987 edition has been
the name of Tom McKean . . . until the latest publication. Failure to
reach the 1994 European 800 metres final, and last place in the final at
the Victoria Commonwealth Games, have convinced the editors he is past
his sell-by date.
Nothing more loudly proclaims the Bellshill Bullet to be a spent force
than his silent omission from the Who's Who of his sport. But this week,
as he prepared for the latest seasonal debut of his career, McKean
brushed aside the whispers, and dismissed rumours of his demise as an
international force.
McKean, however, has no interest in what is, or is not, written about
him. ''I gave up worrying about anything like that long ago,'' he says
with the assured calm of a man who knows that his exploits, upon
occasion, overshadow even those of world record-holder Sebastian Coe.
''Yes, some of the media have chosen to concentrate on my failures,
and that is understandable. But the fact is that only at the World and
Olympic championships have I failed to gain medals.
''I have medals from the European Championships, indoor and out, from
the World indoor, Comonwealth Games, European Cup, World Cup -- all of
them gold, except the Commonwealths, where I have two silvers.
''If people like Brian Whittle and I don't support the national
championships, we are criticised for being unpatriotic. If we come out
and do them, as the first event of our season, like this weekend, and
don't win well, we are crucified for not being good enough -- usually in
newspapers, whose writers understand nothing about the sport.''
Yet most UK athletes would relish the status of failure as exemplified
by Tom McKean.
Headlines like ''McFlop'' -- when his debut challenge at the 1987
World Championship fizzled out -- used to worry him, so much so that he
stopped reading newspapers. ''But they upset my friends and family more.
It was they for whom I felt most sorry.''
A niggling calf injury forced McKean to delay the start of this season
until last night's opening session of the Scottish championships at
Meadowbank, where he safely negotiated the heats for a place in today's
final.
Defiantly, he insists: ''I would not be running if I did not believe
that I have yet to achieve my fastest times.''
Yet McKean has failed to improve in each of the last five seasons. In
1989, on a midsummer's eve at Crystal Palace, it seemed as though he had
finally arrived. He clocked 1min 43.88sec, inflicting the first defeat
on Kenya's Olympic champion, Paul Ereng. But that has proved to be one
of many false dawns in McKean's career. That time is still the Scottish
record.
McKean, however, has been more harshly judged than almost any UK
athlete -- a victim of the 800m success of Steve Ovett and Sebastian
Coe. Olympic titles and world records from them placed an unbearable
burden of expectation on the boy from Viewpark.
Yet of those who featured with him in the ATFS class of 87, only the
names of Christie and Jackson have survived the years. Those of Coe,
Ovett, Steve Cram, and Peter Elliot have all gone. So have others like
Daley Thomson and Tim Hutchings.
The man who began his athletics career laying paving slabs for
Motherwell District Council has demolished the credentials of almost all
of the world's greatest two-lap runners. But there is a particular irony
in his presence this weekend at Meadowbank, in Leith, rather than at the
European Cup final in Lille.
For the cup, more than any other event, underlines just how good
McKean has been. Called in as a reserve for Coe in 1985, he went to
Moscow and won a bruising contest which he likened to ''trying to push
your way into a Glasgow bar on a Saturday night.''
It was the first of a unique four cup victories -- two more than Coe
-- but his physical style was to haunt him subsequently. He was
disqualified for barging in the 1988 Olympics. ''Because of the calf
injury, I asked not to be considered for Lille,'' he says.
Just before McKean's initial Europa success, Cram returned to
Tyneside, fresh from victory in Oslo's Dream Mile, in world record time.
It was meant to be an exhibition home-coming for the Geordie, who was
paid #8000 to appear. Instead, a Scottish unknown -- McKean -- took time
off his #60 per week YTS job, was paid meagre expenses, then stuffed
Cram on his home track. It was his thirty-fifth successive win at the
distance since losing the Scottish 800m title to Paul Forbes in 1983.
McKean's initial Europa Cup win clinched sponsorship with Ayrshire
entrepreneur Glen Henderson, and he subsequently enjoyed backing from
Paisley office equipment firm, Giltron.
''I'm grateful, but these deals finished long ago. I'm all right
financially, but running is my job, and like any other job, if it
doesn't pay decent wages, you look elsewhere. Once a real job offers
more money, I'll quit.''
Last year, McKean suffered a catalogue of injuries, and despite
cutting his foot on a razor in Victoria, reached the Commonwealth final.
''But I had too many injuries. My mistake was not having the bottle that
Curtis Robb had, to withdraw for the season.''
With a second child on the way -- Craig, now aged 15 weeks -- McKean
gave serious thought to quitting. ''I'm glad I did not, for I have a
real hunger now. I am desperate to run, and run well. I am not thinking
about the AAAs (the world trials) or World Championships. If I run well,
I will be going. If I don't, I won't.
''I don't kid myself I'm in the higher echelons of the sport, like
Linford Christie or Roger Black, Kris Akabusi or Colin Jackson. But I
will not carry on and do league athletics. Once I'm out, I'm out. I
admire those who become veterans, and still compete. But it's not for
me.
''I enjoy coaching -- there are people whom I help, racing at
Meadowbank this weekend. I will probably try biathlons -- I could not
live without some kind of activity. But I know that once I quit, it will
take a couple of years for me to become 'normal' again.
McKean acknowledges that the sands are running out. ''I know I could
still be No.1 in Scotland three years from now, and go to the 1998
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. But I have to ask whether I would
want to go, and struggle in world terms, perhaps fail to make the semis.
I've asked myself that question, and know I won't be there.
''But I believe I am good enough to run in next year's Olympics,
hopefully good enough for two or three more seasons. I certainly know
where I want it to end.
''My perfect goodbye will be at the Kelvin Hall, where I won the
European indoor title. Some year, that's where I will bow out --
hopefully not next winter.''
Whatever his fate, McKean's status as an aristocrat of Scottish
athletics is assured.

WOMEN'S hour, if you have a sense of the surreal, makes for hilarious
listening. While attempting to work out the maybe-resignation of John
Major, I found myself contemplating plumbing. Now Annabel is a female
plumber, and plummy with it, and she was telling the nation about the
importance of knowing where our valves are. I was awash with guilt,
while she was being interviewed with some reverence.
Did you know, dear reader, that when you called a plumber you were
inviting a stranger to probe into your intimate places? I've never
thought about my bathroom as being an intimate place -- I checked with a
friend and she felt the same . . . but seemingly that is why plumber
choice can be so stressful.
Now I totally understand why a female cab company is a good idea,
especially in London, but I really, with my hand on my 40-something
feminist heart, could not give a damn about the gender of a person
fixing my ballcock. I thought I was in touch with all my areas of guilt,
mother-guilt when I'm working, writer-guilt when I'm watching Power
Rangers with Daniel, but to listen to a programme that suggests there is
a world of house maintenance sensitivity which I have disregarded made
me turn to Radio Scotland.
But then I found a programme about the problems of going on holiday
when you've got a dog. I had this horrendous vision of the Tories
getting in again because Major leaving meant we had Heseltine, hair
flapping like a spaniel's ears, panting for power and making for our
coasts.
But to be fair, the Scottish station redeemed itself with a very funny
piece about Scottish stand-up comics. It managed to sound truthfully
conversational while the accumulated effect was clever: the strange
experience of going out on a limb with only your humour to keep you
company was well conveyed. Also well conveyed to the nation was the news
of the (qualified) resignation by Radio Scotland just after 5pm on
Thursday. Radio Five actually got the news first, but you couldn't
interrupt the rugby for a non-major player, could you? It was announced
about 11 on Friday morning that there would be the statement at half
eleven and there wasn't, was there? We got Douglas Hurd at 12.25pm
instead -- Lord, we must have done something wrong in a former pre-Tory
life.
And then to Jimmy Young on Radio Two. Some lady phoned in to say that
the whole problem was Catholic countries and their animal-uncaring. We
have a derided government making a complete ass of itself; a decimated
health service, and a education system that disallowed pencils, but the
voice of Little England slotted between Don Maclean and Henry Mancini
speaks out. Viva la liberta. Baroness Thatcher wants to hear a ringing
endorsement of Major's leadership. (Until the first ballot). Anthony
Howard was astute and knowledgeable as usual talking to Young about the
ongoing farce: shame about the response.
Would not a Desert Island without Sue Lawley be wonderful? It's a
great old-fashioned successful idea for a programme, but that
fake-accented sincerity grates like media chalk squeaking across a
blackboard. Professor Magdi Yacoub, humanist, heart surgeon and
Mozart-lover -- the civilised voice which you would think would remind
you (I'm sorry my cynicism blipped there) -- you would hope might be the
kind of person to be in government. Like most people in medicine I know,
Professor Yacoub, cannot bear what is happening to the known, Professor
Yacoub, cannot bear what is happening to the NHS, but Lawley's banal
questioning did not draw him out to anything but his love of music. Ah,
James Cameron could have done it, waving the flag of intelligence,
voicing the anthem of articulacy -- Oh Hurds and Majors, please go tend
your gardens and leave us alone to get on with it.

AN absurd prissiness and self-delusion infests the drugs debate. Think
about it. All the happy hacks stub out their fags, give a quick
whisky-belch, turn to their keyboards to arraign the young for being
drawn into substance abuse.
A growth industry of thoroughly sound middle-aged people anguish over
the growth of drug abuse at conferences -- then head for the bar for a G
&amp; T or three before dinner and a bottle or two of chilled Chablis. Just
to unwind you understand.
This week Strathclyde consumer and trading standards officers have
been nipping into stores that sell pipes, books, and all the soft-drug
paraphernalia for rolling joints. Did they light up in the car on the
way back to the office to file a report? Just to unwind you understand.
We grown-ups may get a hit out of booze and nicotine: nobody pretends
any more that Guinness is a health drink or Silk Cut are therapeutic.
But these are the choices we make, rational or not, and we depend on a
culture that allows us the liberty to make them.
The do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do philosophy of child rearing never worked
then and it won't wash the Doc Martens now.
A report published this week in Strathclyde showed a majority of young
people will have tried soft drugs at some point. One in three teenagers
from the age of 16 in Glasgow claims to take drugs while two thirds
drink alcohol. Greater Glasgow Health Board's random sample of 1100 16
to 19-year-olds showed that 20% of males and 13% of females drank more
than the recommended sensible weekly levels. Overall 33% got drunk at
least once a week.
What does this mean? That the drink-and-drugs culture is reaching
lethal proportions? Anyone under 20 should be locked up for fear someone
offers them a swig of Martini Bianco swiped from the cocktail cabinet?
Surely the most telling result from the survey was that young people
know a lot about drugs and perceive them as much more dangerous than
alcohol. Crucially, they expect their use to slacken as they get older.
They thought it was a phase. They thought they would grow out of it.
Young people have never been better informed or more sophisticated
listeners. They have an inbuilt bullshit detection system which
automatically sifts out the static of hypocritical blather. They also
have a tendency to believe they are immortal.
We might recall the two-year study of young men in the North-west of
England, including football hooligans. It found that in their transition
from hooligans to ravers, they stopped drinking and swallowed Ecstasy.
It encouraged a desire for friendship and togetherness, not aggression.
Then, when there was a shortage of their favourite drug on the streets,
they reverted to kicking each other's heads in under the influence of
the perfectly legal drug alcohol.
This is not advocacy for letting it all hang out, man. It's simply to
point out that over-stating the risks does not work.
The hysterical use of the word ''abuse'' has evolved to cover
everything from shouting at your children to the sorry conflation of
youth and drink called, in some circles, date rape. Lumping emotional
maltreatment alongside sexual and physical abuse, or claiming that
drunken teenage fumblings are sexual abuse, dilutes the real message and
serves as a distraction from the difficulties faced by those who know
the difference.
Pretending that one smoke of a joint, one swig of a Moscow Mule, is
substance abuse is equally dangerous. And just as daft. Beyond
reinforcing the youthful belief that anyone over 26 is a numbskull, it
does little to advance any cause. Surely to lose sight of that is to
lose the ability to be able to do anything about it.
Grown-ups use legal drugs because they like the feeling. They enjoy a
''social'' drink at the pub, or in the company of friends. Young people
take drugs, or drink, presumably, for similar reasons. Because it blots
out bad feelings, makes them sociable, and makes them forget the misery
of what's inside their heads or homes.
They are not beings from another planet, it just feels that way
sometimes.  Let's stop the pretence and tell the truth. Offer sound
information about risks instead of trying to scare the designer pants
off them. Let them know the perils. But stop confusing a youthful
inclination to taste the thrill of the forbidden with the sad road to
smack use or Temazapan addiction.   Otherwise the drugs debate will
choke on its own absurdities. Better to be cool than dead.

PROPHECY -- in the biblical sense -- is not about foretelling the
future. Those sects who find spiritual comfort from using the Bible like
an almanac are doing a severe disservice to the Old Testament prophets,
whose role was more like a commentator on current events.
Prophets read back into events rather than forward. Occasionally they
would offer what amounted to a prediction along the lines ''If we go on
like this, it's bound to end in tears.''
Futurologists, on the other hand, deal in prediction, they conjure
what might be, out of what not yet is. The father of twentieth-century
futurology is, arguably, Jules Verne who got a great deal correct in his
stories which at the time of writing seemed fantastic fiction. He began
a movement which has become sci-fi, and its most populist vehicle, Star
Trek, blends futurology, cops and robbers, and methodology which
occasionally has a biblical style.
I am not sure whether to call Aldous Huxley a prophet or a
futurologist. He was a supreme example of that formidable intellectual
-- the literate scientist. The Huxley family have been vastly
influential in British intellectual life for the past century as
scientists and philosophers.
Huxley chose to write novels, and the one by which he is most often
remembered is a brilliant piece of futorology and prophecy combined.
Brave New World was written over 60 years ago but it is not until
recently that the scenario it portrays has become a scientific
possibility.
The book is sometimes compared with George Orwell's 1984, but in my
view Huxley's work is by far the most imaginative and perceptive of the
two. It is set in a highly sophisticated society in which social control
is the norm and pleasures are dispensed to keep everyone happy. Sex is
divorced from reproduction which is provided in factories with test-tube
babies bred and ranked for the various tasks which society demands of
them. The ruling elite of Alphas provide the dictator figure of the
Controller, a title adopted by the BBC for its top people -- I have
never been sure whether from self mockery or imitation of Huxley's
sophist society.
The central character in the book is the Savage, a human who has been
born free outwith the highly controlled regimen of genetic manipulation
and behavourial conditioning. He is a throw back, the equivalent of a
Stone Age caveman arriving in the computer age. But the Savage has
insight, his emotions seem noble compared with the shallow hedonism of
the Controller's world, and the key passage in the book is the dialogue
between the two in which the Controller mocks the Savage's wish to live
a natural life in freedom.
''Free to die from disease?'' sneers the Controller, listing the types
of calamity and suffering which are consequences of freedom. ''Do you
claim these?'' he asks. ''I claim them all,'' says the Savage. In a
moving passage which has echoes of the confrontation between Jesus and
Pontius Pilate.
Huxley's Brave New World was a chamber of horrors. It was written
before the character of the Third Reich became known, 30 years before
the sexual revolution of the sixties, and 60 years before genetic
engineering reached the stage it is at today.
However, in 1937 Huxley wrote another work of non-fiction entitled
Ends and Means. It is an optimistic look at the future, promoting a
religious philosophy which the author calls ''non-attachment'' and which
he finds most fully developed in Buddhism. He argues that most of the
world's troubles spring from humans being too ''attached'' to sensations
and emotions.
In Ends and Means Huxley predicts the spread of nuclear power but this
is the only aspect in which his vision seems mistaken, in that he fails
to anticipate the toxic waste or terrorist threats it poses, envisaging
many nuclear plants heating and lighting our homes.
Huxley's later work included Doors of Perception in which he assesses
the positive effect the hallucinogenic drug mescalin had upon him.
Huxley had moved to California around the time that Timothy Leary was
urging the use of such substances and unfortunately Huxley's image
became tarnished as the decadence of the hippy experiment became clear.
This is particularly ironic since in Brave New World, Huxley satirises
the use of such drugs to subdue the population.
Late in his career (he died in 1963) he attempted to create a
fictional Utopia in his novel Island, but it never achieved the same
appeal as the awful warning of Brave New World.
Aldous Huxley's work (both fiction and non-fiction) is important
because he identified trends in science and human thinking which proved
to be determinative ones in Western society. His work also makes
stimulating reading.
Futurology is neither an art nor a science but it involves both the
art of thinking imaginatively and the ability to apply logic to the
possibilities which technology afford us.
This genre has been neglected in recent years. Perhaps because of
Future Shock -- the extremely rapid pace of change which makes us
incapable of looking ahead. Perhaps because so much of our social and
political planning and our scientific research and industrial
development is dictated by short-term thinking.
Have we become too pessimistic and bewildered to think clearly about
the future and to dream of Utopia?
We read a lot about potential ecological disaster which could befall
the planet. It would be nice to read a vision of the future which
stretches out the positive benefits which science can bring us. For, as
the prophet said, where there is no vision the people perish.

ADRIAN DAVIES, Glasgow Council on Alcohol, cites the Scotch Whisky
Association's complaint that tax increases have led to a fall in sales
to support his call for more, rather than less, control of the
consumption of alcoholic drinks by individuals as a means of controlling
problem drinking (June 20).
There has never been any argument that Government policies can or
cannot control consumption. The trap into which Mr Davies fell is that
of believing that if you lower consumption, ipso facto you lower levels
of misuse.
Unfortunately, all experience where this is tried shows that it is the
sensible drinker who is penalised by increased taxes, or other
restrictions on sales, while the non-sensible continues doing what he
always did: except that he either spends more of his resources to
satisfy his need, perhaps to the detriment of his family, or he trades
down to more dangerous substances.
In the UK, a more balanced approach has been found to work, as the
Scottish Council on Alcohol knows, where educational programmes and
measures work when targeted at those thought most likely to be at risk
of getting their drinking patterns wrong.
Alcohol consumption per head has remained more or less static here for
20 years or more, and we remain among the most sober nations in the
Western world -- ranked 21st, well behind many of our neighbours like
France, Germany, Portugal, and Spain.

MICHAEL FRY is of course perfectly correct to identify the ''one-party
state'' syndrome that is regrettably typical of local government in
west-central Scotland as the true source of the kind of corruption that
has now been incontrovertibly exposed in Professor Black's Monklandgate
report (June 21).
His simultaneous claim that this exclusive one-party domination is
simply a reflection of the (Scottish) electorate's wishes ought
nevertheless to have been qualified by the recognition that even in the
recent elections for the new unitary authorities the Labour Party --
despite the almost unprecedented scale of its victory -- actually failed
to secure a majority of the Scottish popular vote.
As Michael Fry himself ought to be only too well aware, the extent to
which Labour dominates Scottish local government -- and indeed Scottish
representation at Westminster -- is not a simple consequence of
''democratic principle'', as he disingenuously maintains.
It is a consequence, on the contrary, of our blatantly undemocratic
electoral system which could be altered almost at the stroke of his
beloved Tory Government's pen, authorising the adoption of a genuine
system of proportional representation.
To take but one example, it is self-evidently outrageous that the SNP
in Glasgow only managed to secure the election of a single, solitary
councillor, out of a total of 83, to the new authority despite achieving
23% of the votes cast across the city.

WHY all the fuss (June 21)? The situation exposed by the Black Report
has existed in the area to one degree or another since at least 1926.
Anyone who reads the press or keeps abreast of life in Scotland knows
that Monklands is only the tip of the iceberg. No-one who has lived
under the benevolent comrades in Dumbarton will be persuaded that
Monklands differs in anything other than degree from what has been going
on all over Scotland for decades.
It has been general knowledge for ever and a day that Labour councils
were Monklands in miniature (or in camera).
The Black Report certainly raises some interesting questions: Why did
John Smith take no action; why is it that Messrs Robertson and McConnell
took no action until their hand was forced by London; and why did London
take no action for years apart from trying to off-load the
responsibility on to the Scottish Office?
As the Labour Party is so insistent that erring Tory Ministers should
resign, when are we going to see the resignation of Messrs Robertson and
McConnell?
When is Tony Blair going to insist upon -- and follow through -- a
Scotland-wide programme to clean out all the other councils which have
been following in Monklands footsteps? It is great media fodder to
attack the Tories but not so much fun to implement the same ''holier
than thou'' policies in his own back yard.
When are we going to see the resignation of the Monklands councillors?
Or those in Dumbarton? Or anywhere else, for that matter?
If Tony Blair does not publicly take effective action to clean out his
Augean stables, how does he expect us to conclude that his party is any
more qualified to run the country than the Tories he accuses so
enthusiastically of being sleaze-ridden?
Surely there can be no truth in the scurrilous tale that the reason
for such a high Labour vote in Scotland is that Scots have learnt, over
the years, that if they do not vote for the comrades they have no hope
of obtaining services, accommodation or jobs from the local council?

I AM appalled that the international community does not condemn
vociferously the genocide taking place in Sarajevo. The bloody massacre
of innocent citizens is not only terrorism in its most concerted form,
it is a crime against humanity.
The Serbs have no legitimate target in this city and therefore must be
vilified for the indiscriminate slaughter they perpetrate on a daily
basis. That ordinary townspeople are blown apart for daring to seek
bread or water is horrific, and yet it goes on and on.
These poor people have been deserted by a collective community that
quietly watches on, wringing its hands. For a so-called civilised world
this is indeed a cruel reality.
I can understand, though may not agree with, the reluctance to get
involved in (joint) direct action to halt this carnage, but it belittles
our so-called leaders to avoid condemnation which would make it clear
that the people who order this barbarism will ultimately be held
accountable for their actions.

THE Prime Minister's decision to resign the leadership of the
Conservative Party has been hailed in some quarters as an act of a
courageous man.
As Mr Major would appear to have the universal backing of his Cabinet
and the pre-arranged support of the 1922 Committee, it does not seem so
much a courageous move as a cunning diversion.
Rather than seeking the gelded backing of his party, he would achieve
greater credibility if he sought a mandate from the electorate.
W Gardner Young,
32 Rowallan Gardens,

Attack on principles
THE resignation of John Major as leader of the Conservative Party is a
fundamental attack on the principles of our democracy. The country is
now plunged into a situation whereby the democratically elected Prime
Minister may be removed from office by the vote of a number of
Conservative MPs. Not even ordinary members of the Conservative Party
will have the opportunity to have a say in this matter.
Many criticisms have been made over the selection procedures of my
party, the Labour Party, but one thing that can be said is that last
year many more people had the opportunity to have a say in the election.
What is fundamentally important is that the elected Prime Minister of
this country can now be removed from office, no doubt by grey-suited men
plotting in cigar-smoke-filled dark rooms.
Mr Major's reasoning is that there had been whispering campaigns
against him within his party. He must be aware that the electorate at
large are howling with indignation at his policies which have seen
substantial increases in tax and consequent erosion of the living
standards.
If Mr Major is to resign from his party because of whispering
campaigns he should now resign from office and test his position with
the electorate. Simply speaking, he should Put Up To Shut Us Up.

Coast has sneaked in a train without anyone noticing.
On Fridays only from June 30 to August 25, the latest timetable shows
a departure from Glasgow Central at 8.10pm and Edinburgh at 9.15pm,
which eventually arrives in King's Cross at 4.15am.
No doubt this will be a somewhat early arrival for some people, but at

DURING the local government reorganisation of 1975 I was transferred
from employment by Coatbridge Burgh Council to employment by Monklands
District Council. During the process of ''matching in'' of staff,
Monklands District Council required staff to answer a questionnaire. I
recall my trade union, Nalgo, instructing staff not to answer a question
which sought to discover the religious persuasion, if any, of the
individuals now in the council's employ.
I recall a council that paid scant attention to the loyal service and
conscientious work of staff during their employment prior to 1975. I
recall a senior official who openly boasted of ''playing politics'' and
''handpicking'' his staff.
I recall my profession being diluted by an unqualified person being
appointed to a post intended for a person with professional
qualifications. I recall complaining, to no avail, both to the council's
personnel officer, and to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
I recall realising that it would neither have been honourable nor
professional to remain in the employment of that council.
Why has Professor Black only been allowed to inquire into the past
five years of Monklands District Council? Were these the five good
years? What went on during the 15 other years?

TELEVISION reaches its traditional summer hiatus this week with new
shows conspicuously absent and the dreaded words ''another chance to see
. . .'' featuring all too prominently in its schedules. Like a good
curry, programmes tend to repeat on you at this time of year.
Still, every cloud . . . the BBC's Manchester outpost at Pebble Mill
offers a variation on the seasonal theme of repetition with ''a
retrospective look'' at the career of Tony Hancock through the eyes of
disc jockey (and East Cheam fan) John Peel. Essentially a selection of
clips, it is a timely reminder of a comic genius, and a man who, even 27
years after his untimely death, still stands as perhaps the funniest
television actor of them all. Peel has the good sense to let the clips
speak for themselves.
Hancock's World (BBC2, Tuesday) concentrates on the comedian's
brilliant and prolific TV output between 1956 and 1961. Hancock's
Half-Hour, written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, was -- and remains --
the benchmark for television humour. No-one has even approached its
standard since.
Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock, of 23 Railway Cuttings, was the
lugubrious, self-mocking, sage of East Cheam. The greatest misanthrop
since W C Fields. A comic paradox who couldn't tell a joke to save his
life but who was blessed with a perfect sense of timing. His was the
pure humour of situation comedy. Galton and Simpson placed him (and,
more to the point, his aspirations) into real-life situations -- and
then sat back and allowed his misery, his depression, and his pathos to
do the rest. The results were hilarious.
In his homburg hat and astrakhan-collared overcoat, he was a Man for
his Times. The late fifties, that strange interval between the austerity
of the post-war years and the flashy hedonism of the Swinging Sixties.
An entire generation identified with his anal retentive attitudes, his
wild prejudices, his pretentions, and his woefully misplaced ambitions.
He was a true Brit. In the classic The Blood Donor he was ''British,
undiluted for 12 generations, 100% Anglo-Saxon with perhaps just a touch
of Viking''. He was also pompous, sarcastic, and gloriously rude. A snob
of epic proportions.
But in real life his mistake was to be the same -- and then some. He
was an alcoholic, he beat his wife, he was prone to severe depression.
His problem was that he wanted to be more, much more, than his given
talents and his intelligence would permit.
J B Priestley, who based a character in one of his novels on Hancock,
described him as a man ''who overdrew on his intellectual bank
balance''. When the quality Sundays began to write erudite profiles on
him, when he was the subject of a Face To Face interview, he was seduced
by the system. He deluded himself into believing that he was not simply
a comic genius (which he was) but an intellectual genius (which he was
not).
With grandiose and far-fetched plans for his future, he ditched Galton
and Simpson in 1961. Ironically, they were at the height of their
popularity. More than 30% of the adult population had tuned in to watch
The Blood Donor. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was even heard to
complain that affairs of state prevented him from watching.
But Hancock, an obsessive perfectionist, had bigger, far more
pretentious, ideas. He dreamed of a future in Hollywood, of writing a
musical, of becoming a truly great classical actor. It all came to
nothing. And ended abruptly, alone and in despair in Sydney, Australia,
in 1968.
Hancock had gone there in a vain attempt to resurrect his failing
career. On the night of June 25, he killed himself with an overdose of
sleeping pills and vodka. His suicide note stated that things seemed to
be going wrong too many times.
Fellow comedian and contemporary Spike Milligan summed up his late
life thus: ''One by one he shut the door on all the people he knew. Then
he shut the door on himself.''
As Tuesday's programme will show, Hancock left a legacy of brilliant
humour; of comedy which is both universal and timeless. A couple of
years ago when the BBC repeated Hancock's Half-Hour more than 13 million
people -- more than the average audience for EastEnders -- tuned in to
watch.
Now nineties comic Paul Merton is stepping in to Hancock's shoes,
currently working on a re-make for ITV of The Lift, a Hancock's
Half-Hour episode first shown in 1961. If it is a success then he plans
to re-make classics like The Blood Donor and The Radio Ham. Merton is
either brave or foolhardy. What's the point, after all, of doing again
what has already been done perfectly by the master of comedy?
* EVER since the demise of Ready Steady Go! television has had a big
problem with rock music. It just hasn't known how to pitch it. Should it
be light, fluffy, and banal like the anodine Top of the Pops or
too-earnest-by-half like The Old Grey Whistle Test? The answer is, of
course, that it should be neither. Today rock music is a respectable
subject, as worthy of being taken seriously as classical or jazz music.
And, more to the point, it's now enjoyed by more or less everyone under
the age of 50.
In recent months there have been some clear signs that, at last,
television appears to be getting the message. C4's recent Saturday night
live-music show, The White Room, coupled with the same channel's
excellent Jools Holland programme have served to prove that you can take
your rock-and-roll seriously but still make it fun. In addition, BBC2's
documentary series, The Music Biz, which ended last week, was a
constructive attempt to investigate the pop industry.
Now comes Rock Family Trees (BBC2, Saturday), which marks another step
in the right direction. This programme has its roots -- and this
fortysomething reporter remembers them -- in the pages of the old New
Musical Express where they used to publish Pete Frame's lifelines of
your favourite pop group. These diagrams, in effect hand-drawn
genealogical trees, reflected the diverse connections between bands.
The most complex, as I recall, was that of Fairport Convention who
went through about 50 incarnations over the years (and who still get
wheeled out for the occasional folk festival). Almost as complicated was
Fleetwood Mac, the subject of the first in the Rock Family Trees
six-part series.
As Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, the group started off as a straight
blues outfit in 1967. At the time guitarist Green was on a par with
Clapton, his songwriting talent providing hits like Need Your Love So
Bad, Albatross, and Oh Well. But in 1970, as a result of the effects of
drink and drugs, Peter Green lost the place and left the band. Today he
is an eccentric recluse.
Actually, come to think of it, being Fleetwood Mac's guitarist has
proven to be something of a curse. Whatever happened to Jeremy Spencer,
Danny Kirwin, Bob Weston, and Bob Welch?
After several years in relative obscurity, founder members Mick
Fleetwood and John McVie resurfaced in LA with ex-Chicken Shack's
Christine Perfect (McVie's wife) and Californian duo Lindsey Buckingham
and Stevie Nicks. That particular Fleetwood Mac was the most successful
of all. Rumours was one of the most successful AOR albums of the 70s. No
ageing rocker's record collection is complete without it. By the mid
80s, they were one of the biggest stadium bands in the world.
Rock Family Trees charts the group's 28-year history and, through
interviews with some of the major players, examines the personal
relationships on which the band's success depended.
Subsequent programmes in the series will feature the New York punk
scene of the early seventies (Talking Heads, Blondie, The New York
Dolls); Deep Purple (back to which every self-respecting hard-rock band
of the seventies can trace its roots); the Brummie bands of the sixties
(Moody Blues, the Move, ELO, and Wizard); and the British R&amp;B boom
(which started with John Mayall and went on to groups like the
Yardbirds, Manfred Mann, and Cream).
* THE worst psychiatrist in America makes a welcome return in a new
series of Frasier (C4, Friday). In this, the second season for the Emmy
award-winning comedy, look out for guest appearances from some familiar
faces from Frasier's Cheers past -- including his ex-wife Lilith (Bebe
Neuwirth), ex-girlfriend Diane Chambers (Shelley Long), and his old
mucker Sam Malone (Ted Danson).
In the first episode, the Seattle-based Frasier (Kelsey Grammer)
discovers that an old acquaintance has written a steamy novel based on
Frasier's early years. As a callow youth in Boston he was introduced to
the joys of sex by Miss Warner, his piano teacher and a woman more than
twice his age. His initial feelings of anger turn to regret for an
opportunity lost. So he decides to seek out Miss Warner . . . and
unfortunately he finds her.
* THE South Bank Show (ITV, Sunday) profiles Nora Ephron, the most
successful screenwriter and movie director in Hollywood with films like
Silkwood, When Harry Met Sally, and Sleepless in Seattle to her credit.
The daughter of Tinseltown parents (Henry and Pheobe Ephron co-wrote the
scripts for, among others, Carousel and There's No Business Like Show
Business), Nora started out as a Washington-based newspaper reporter and
married Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein.
The marriage collapsed when Nora, pregnant with their second child,
discovered Bernstein was having an affair (with Margaret Jay, wife of
the then British Ambassador and now the BBC's Economics Editor, Peter
Jay). Ephron later wrote Heartburn, a savagely funny novel about the
break-up of her marriage, which she later turned into her first
screenplay. Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep subsequently starred in Mike
Nichol's adaptation.
An entire generation identified with his anal retentive attitudes, his
wild prejudices, his pretentions, and his woefully misplaced ambitions
The sage of East Cheam: Hancock's Half-Hour was -- and remains -- the
benchmark for television humour.

NOT ashamed to state my musical preferences, Rimsky-Korsakov's
Scheherazade sits in the midst of my Top Ten. Played with absolute
passion and commitment, last night's Prom performance from the Royal SNO
can only serve to push Scheherazade nearer to my personal No 1.
Born into a naval family, Rimsky depicts a life on the ocean wave with
astute and convincing observation of his subject matter. Orchestrated
with astonishing attention to detail, the resultant music is wildly
evocative, if not entirely programmatic.
Japanese conductor Takuo Yuasa is no stranger to Scottish audiences,
his regular appearances with the BBC SSO winning him many admirers. His
handling last night of Scheherazade was impeccable.
Leader Edwin Pailing carried off the treacherously exposed solo violin
part with ravishing elegance, supported by a wind section in dazzling
form. All section principals deserve a mention but particularly Julian
Roberts's bassoon and Stephane Rancourt's oboe.
Pianist Martin Jones, making his Royal SNO debut, succeeded in
carrying off a challenging programme of Chopin and Litolff. Chopin's
delicate Andante Spianato was modest and refined, just as the composer
originally intended, while the Grande Polonaise reflected its title
without being overtly exploitative.
After a virtuosic romp through Litolff's Scherzo, Jones surely booked
his return ticket to the Royal SNO with his breathtaking party piece --
Percy Grainger's clever pastiche, Cake Walk Smasher.

WE are fast approaching the 50th anniversary since hostilities with
Japan ceased but as yet, unlike Germany, Japan has refused to apologise
to internees for the appalling treatment they suffered while in
captivity. They state they have nothing to apologise for.
It may come as a surprise to readers that civilian internees fared
worse after the war as a result of their treatment while interned.
The Association of British Civilian Internees Far East Region
(ABCIFER) has recently been formed to put the case again to the Japanese
Government to ask for the following assurances:
Japan formally apologises to the British civilian internees by
expressing profound remorse for the unbearable suffering and sorrow
caused; intends as reconciliation to make prompt and meaningful
financial amends to British victims of Imperial Japanese forces; and
gives an assurance that such acts will never be repeated.
Germany by the year 2000 will have paid out US $66bn to compensate
Polish, Russian, Jewish, and other victims. All that is asked is that
Japan does the same.
ABCIFER requests that Japan be denied a permanent seat on the UN
Security Council until these requirements have been fulfilled.

Q: WHEN we moved into our new house, we dug up the front garden and
then sowed grass seed. Last year, it looked promising enough, but this
year there are bare areas with compacted ground. Despite raking,
re-sowing and dressing the areas with new soil, there are still bare
patches. What do I do now?
A: The best thing would be to see your particular garden. However,
there are three possible causes. One is disease by fungi lurking in the
ground. Your local garden centre may be able to advise on that, if you
give them a sample. Another cause could be pests, like leatherjackets,
which attack new grass. Lay down a wet sack. If the pests come to the
surface, water on a suitable insecticide such as Carbaryl or Sybol.
Lastly, there is the possibility of chemical trouble, a residual
weedkiller, for example. Soil analysis would be the answer here.
Q: I HAVE two lilac bushes. One is white and the other a pleasant
lilac. They were planted four months ago and have grown quite well. They
look sturdy enough, and were put in good soil, but they produce only a
flower or two. So what should I do?
A: Strange as it may seem, you may have been too good to your bushes.
The thing to make a lilac flower is often to plant it in poor soil. Try
a scattering of sulphate of potash around the base of the bushes. This
will tend to restrict growth, and may shock them into rapid flowering
next year.

SURVIVING the onslaught of garden centres, and indeed thriving, is the
old established firm of Thomas Dagg and Sons.
Set up in 1913 by the late Thomas Dagg, one of its major customers was
the Corporation of Glasgow parks department.
Other clients were the landed gentry, visited regularly by the firm's
soberly dressed representatives. The company was bought over by the late
Scott Cochran in 1961 and is now owned by his son, also Scott.
He says: ''We remain totally dedicated to gardening in all its
different facets, despite pressure to do otherwise.
''It is only in the last few years that we stopped packing our own
seed. Our customers tend to be serious gardeners, with specific needs,
rather than hobby gardeners. We are able to track down sources of supply
for specialist items.
''A lot of our customers like to pop in from the office, or on their
way home. Our staff of five are very experienced and able to answer most
of the questions from keen gardeners.
''One thing we pride ourselves on is being able to supply many items
not considered economically viable in most garden centres. We also have
a good delivery service available, and do mail order worldwide.''
He is proud that the company has survived on their horticultural
trade, without the need for tea rooms or other gimmicks. He has no
desire to get into the garden centre business, with its seven-day
opening and long hours.

The woman once dubbed 'Sour Kraut' is showing signs of mellowing,
reports James Traynor.
THE chances are Steffi Graf, who has just won the French Open Tennis
Championship, will be exchanging pleasantries with an old friend, the
Duchess of Kent, at Wimbledon in two weeks' time while collecting the
world's most famous silver tea tray for the sixth time.
Graf went home to Bruhl on Thursday fretting over a sore wrist, but
perhaps worrying more about the chronic back problem which threatens to
force her into retirement earlier than she had anticipated, but she
insists that from Monday she will be stalking the lawns of the All
England Lawn Tennis Club in search of the most coveted championship in
women's tennis. Forget last year's first-round exit. It would be foolish
to believe someone other than a healthy Graf will win the ladies'
singles crown.
Given her fitness concerns and a growing awareness that there is life
after tennis, a sixth championship would probably help her relax perhaps
for the first time in her life. Laid-back, amiable, gregarious,
considerate, charitable. Thus far none of these could be used in
connection with Graf, who continues to treat all factions of the media,
but especially the press, as the enemy.
She never could, probably never will, understand newspapers' fixation
with her exploits. Graf, the reluctant superstar, the arrogant Teuton
who has always been willing to take but slow to give in return.
Although the usual denials are issued constantly with Graf insisting,
but no longer with the same commitment, that she will perform for as
many as five more years, the signs are that her horizons have expanded
dramatically. Having just turned 26 the Garbo of the sporting world has
discovered an existence beyond the white lines of tennis courts and is
anxious to indulge other passions.
She has immense wealth -- her personal fortune is said to be around
$30m -- her family home in Germany and a three-storey penthouse
apartment in Manhattan. Also, she has a boyfriend, Formula 3 racing
driver Michael Bartels, a friendship which up until only a few years ago
would never have been allowed.
Until then Graf's career, indeed much of her life, was dictated by her
father Peter, but revelations a few years ago about his affair with
model Nicole Meissner, which later led to a paternity suit, distanced
daughter from patriarch. Steffi remains respectful and grateful for his
work and guidance in the early years, but the relationship, which was
extremely close, is strained now and she has taken to travelling the
tennis circuit without him when for years she lived within his
protective shadow.
''Papa'' Graf was always there keeping the media, fans, and even the
tennis authorities at a safe distance. Often dismissive and sometimes
rude, he adhered strictly to the advice of the late tennis fashion guru,
Ted Tinling, who told Peter Graf: ''Steffi can have no friends in
tennis. You have to understand a star has to be lonely.'' Relationships
outwith the family unit were discouraged.
As a consequence of the protective barrier thrown around her Steffi
grew distant from her public who could not understand why one German,
Boris Becker, could be so accommodating and willing to talk about any
subject, including his disgust at the upsurge of Neo-Nazis in his home
country, while another appeared aloof emerging from her hotel rooms only
to practice or play. Inevitably she became wary of strangers. Everyone
was treated with suspicion, all callers were intruders.
''I don't find it easy to trust people. It seems there are more people
who want things from you than who want to give,'' she once said. ''I
shall find it difficult to find a husband because I shall want to know
if he loves me or the tennis player.''
Bartels was one of the few allowed close enough to declare intentions
one way or the other and the poor little rich kid continued to live her
life solely within tennis until she took her independence from her
father after his own behaviour had threatened to break the family
circle.
She was in Berlin when news of his affair reached her and she had to
be driven into the countryside and left alone to think. This was the man
on whom she had come to rely. How could he do such a thing? Graf was
confused and had to straighten out her own thoughts and then deal with
the world's press who wanted to know how she felt about the matter.
A blanket of despair fell over her and her play was affected even if
she tried to insist otherwise. However, she emerged stronger and more
resolute than ever and convinced her own ability was the only thing that
could be trusted.
The fact is Graf never really needed anyone else so long as tennis
dominated her life and even in the locker rooms she tended to sit alone
speaking to no-one. Off court she was withdrawn and often curt with
anyone who tried to invade her space. Autograph hunters also were
ignored no matter how long they may have stood in wait and it wasn't
long before her reluctance to play the corporate game irked fellow
professionals and the sport's sponsors.
The Women's Tennis Association tried to make her aware of her
responsibilities to the game, but always her father would step in and
deflect any criticism. Peter Graf did not care what anyone thought of
him or his daughter just so long as she continued to win. Tournament
victories, grand slam titles, and the world's No 1 ranking were all that
mattered.
Although there were offers of companionship from the rich and the
famous -- she counts Princess Diana among her friends, George Michael
once offered to take her out on the town, and Don Johnson wanted her to
have a walk-on part in Miami Vice -- Graf refused to live the life of
the superstar and has been driven by a fierce desire to be the best.
However, the woman who became dubbed ''Sour Kraut'' is definitely
mellowing if her agreement to take part in a rather saucy advert for
deodorants can be taken as a reliable gauge.
The ads will show the recently crowned French open champion, a triumph
which blew away the rumours which said she would have to retire because
of her back injury, playing without working up a sweat, presumably after
having used the deodorants which feature 50% larger heads. ''Big balls
make them easier to use,'' said a spokeswoman for the company.
These days Graf has a man who negotiates such deals and Phil de
Picciotto describes his client as a ''global commodity''.
Time was, and not so very long ago at that, when the Grafs would have
baulked at the very notion of anything remotely risque. ''I play tennis.
I am not a model,'' companies have been told ever since 1987 when Graf,
at 17 years of age, became the youngest winner of the women's singles at
the French open.
In 1987 when it became clear she would dominate women's tennis, an
American marketing agency suggested she should have cosmetic surgery to
soften her long and sharp nose, but she was indignant and dismissed the
idea immediately. Then the WTA, mindful that they exist in a world in
which pretty, not to mention seductive pictures help sell products,
asked her to pose wearing a swimming costume on the beach for their
calendar.
Graf was not at all happy but agreed, although she refused to have the
white sock marks on her ankles covered up by fake tan. ''I am a tennis
player,'' she said. ''I am what I am.''
She was even more annoyed when five years ago Playboy offered her
#500,000 to pose nude. Of course, there was never any chance of her
accepting the offer although were it to be repeated today chances are
she would find the magazine's attempt amusing.
A five-times winner at Wimbledon, the winner of 88 major titles, and a
woman who commands lucrative sponsorship deals involving cars, clothes,
and jewellery, Graf, who is also marketing her own brand of jeans, can
afford to take a different view. Gone now is the fearful child who was
prone to self doubt.
Several years ago while in a period of depression she once asked her
then coach, Pavil Slozil, what she might do when she could no longer
cover a court quicker than anyone else or whack a forehand harder and he
listed a number of potential activities. ''I couldn't do any of those
things,'' she lamented, with tears welling up in her eyes. ''I can only
play tennis.''
By playing only tennis Graf has achieved a heady status and she has
matured enough to appreciate various aspects of life to which she is
taking. They were always there, of course, but she was too busy being a
brilliant player and an unaccommodating standard bearer of women's
tennis.
In interviews she would hang her head so that her long blonde hair
covered much of her face and she usually had a hand in front of her
mouth. She made it obvious she disliked being interviewed while others
in her sport recognised they had a duty to sell the game to the public
as much as possible.
Graf, it seems, is determined to come and go without uttering anything
of any great significance even though her sport has needed her to take a
lead in recent years during which the women's side has lost much of its
appeal. Instead of doing more to create interest in the absence of
Monica Seles, the one player who was capable of challenging her
supremacy, Graf continued to play and take.
Ironically it was a deranged fan of Graf who caused the demise of
Seles when he stabbed her in the back during a change-over in a Citizen
Cup match in Hamburg. That was in April 1992 and Seles, whose wide smile
and fits of giggling tended to disguise her true power as a player, has
not played since and in her absence Graf has often appeared bored
witless.
The thought of spending some of her fortune doesn't excite her either
and in Sue Heady's recently published book, Steffi: Public Power,
Private Pain, the story of Graf's thrifty nature is recounted. She
visited Chicago in 1987 and didn't have with her a heavy coat even
though the temperature was sub-zero.
She called her father asking what she should do and when he told her
to buy a coat she said: ''But the one I like is $200.'' She was ordered
to buy it and also a suitable pair of shoes.
Later she called again to Germany and asked: ''Papa, the shoes are
$70. Should I buy them?''
Like many players whose lives have been devoted to hitting tennis
balls there is no great depth to Graf, but perhaps the lack of genuine
competition in the past couple of years has encouraged her to look
beyond her sport and seek other interests. Now she is beginning to talk
of art -- Monet and Dali are two of her favourites -- and of growing
passions for photography and antiques. It has been said she is sounding
now like someone who has decided it is time to change direction.
Her willingness to play doubles at Wimbledon with Martina Navratilova
is being seen as fulfilling a remaining ambition. There is little left
for Graf to prove in the world of sport and winning the doubles with the
greatest women's player of all time might bring a rare smile to a stern
face.
Injury, too, might be forcing Graf towards her final match because the
back problem -- she suffers from osteophyte, a degenerative joint
disease -- has become chronic and must reduce her effectiveness. She has
had to struggle against various illnesses and injuries throughout her
career but the bone spur which is causing her pain is the most serious
of them all and cannot be cured without surgery. That is not an option
she wishes to contemplate at this stage in her life.
Recently she said that if she could be offered the chance to live in
another time she would have liked to have been a cavewoman. ''I would
have loved to have been the first person in the world,'' she added.
She would have been in her element. No-one to waste words on, no
requests for tedious interviews, no fawning sponsors to appease. Left
alone with her thoughts. That sounds like Graf's idea of heaven.

MR DOUGLAS HURD has also had enough, and who could blame him? Like the
Prime Minister he is tired of the abuse from Euro-sceptics posing as
colleagues. He is disillusioned with the pursuit of a policy on Europe
which would satisfy both sides of what is essentially (on the European
issue) two Conservative parties, and he wishes to help the Prime
Minister he discerns as the best hope of holding the sceptics at bay. To
this end he has laid down his post. He was going to do it anyway, but he
believes sincerely that now is the moment when the ability to dangle
great offices of state as carrots to tempt prime ministerial opponents
would be of the greatest benefit to Mr Major. His judgment on this is
not necessarily sound, and he would not describe his actions in
precisely that way, but we will return to that issue later. For the
moment it is sufficient to say that Mr Hurd has always represented the
best sort of Tory politician. He has viewed the river of sleaze
emanating from some sections of the party with weary contempt and it is
recognised widely that his good-heartedness is as willingly available as
his considerable talents. Undoubtedly he wants to spend more time with
his family, and for once this phrase can be taken at face value.
However, the results of Mr Hurd's decision to resign may not be quite
as beneficial to his cherished policies as he might hope. His departure
means the Prime Minister now has reasonable latitude in reshuffling the
Cabinet, a task long overdue and becoming more pressing by the minute.
The key question is what Mr Major will do with his new freedom to offer
substantial posts to friend or foe. The fact that he has this freedom
has added to the element of uncertainty surrounding Tories this weekend,
for both sides of the European argument are now distinctly uneasy at the
prospect of key posts going to their opponents. Both sides, and in
particular the Euro-sceptic supporters of Mr Portillo, will put pressure
on Mr Major to pass the Foreign and Commonwealth Office their way. The
Prime Minister has a choice: he can promise the office to right-wingers
if he believes the leadership election may not go his way, or he can
wait until the election is over and, if he has done well, award the top
post to whoever he pleases. Neither option is likely to be made public
in advance, but we would be wrong if we thought the issue and the
pressures which surround it will not be a significant part of the
campaign for the leadership election. For Mr Hurd, this raises the
possibility that his cherished post may go to someone of whom he
disapproves heartily, but he clearly believes the possible advantages
outweigh the risks.
The benefits for Scotland in all of this are less obvious. To discuss
these we have to move into the realm of hypothetical politics, an
uncomfortable location which sometimes turns out to be disconcertingly
close to reality. First, we should consider Ian Lang, though for Mr Lang
it is better to read Sisyphus, that mythical Greek condemned forever to
roll a large stone up a hill but destined never to complete the task. Mr
Lang has suffered considerably in Scotland and has had as little success
as Sisyphus in rock rolling. As we discuss elsewhere, he might slip
though the centre of the Rifkind-Portillo scrap to steal the Foreign
Office, especially as a loyal friend of the Prime Minister. As with
everything else in the coming days, it will depend on how the votes are
cast on July 4. If Mr Lang did earn his release from Hades there would
be many instant converts to religion, all of them to be found on their
knees praying, ''please, let it not be Forsyth''. They would be wasting
their time. Fate would be pitiless, for there is nobody else in the
Scottish Conservative Party who has the ability to be Secretary of
State. Mr Forsyth has positioned himself cleverly for just such an
eventuality. He has moderated his language on the subject of devolution,
referring to evolution, though without much trace of Darwinian
enthusiasm. Nevertheless, if Mr Major feels he has to adjust his
Scottish policies in the face of outright hostility to the present
version, Mr Forsyth would be handily placed to accomplish a change. It
is a sobering thought, but there is much politicking to come yet.

* SLUGS can't be ignored for long. I see they have been nibbling away
at my bedding plants - fortunately, I had a few replacements - so it's
essential to get busy with the slug pellets, or with natural control
methods.
Slugs love the moist, warm weather we are (supposed to be) having
around this time of year. Like the rest of us, they must eat to survive,
and they're not fussy what they get their teeth into as long as it is
green and succulent. Also, be on your guard for carrot fly and cabbage
root fly, by using gamma BHC dust.

HERE, you are closer to God, and it's a lovesome thing, God wot. It's
where Adam, Eve, Maud, Capability Brown, Percy Thrower and Mr MacGregor,
not forgetting Peter Rabbit and his friends, spent their happiest hours.
Its contents have inspired Bacon, Shakespeare, Milton, Marvell, Yeats,
Wordsworth and a host of others to wax lyrical and poetical.
Strange then to reflect that, in addition to the Original Sin, the
garden has given us those other seven iniquities of Pride, Gluttony,
Anger, Lust, Sloth, Covetousness and Envy.
PRIDE: Behind every proud gardener there is probably a broken-nailed,
creaky-kneed, grass-stained partner tucked away out of sight, often
working under cover of darkness so as not to spoil the illusion of the
little patch of heaven on earth being all the gardener's own work.
His, or her, conversation will be liberally peppered with the
possessive adjective, as in ''My begonias'', ''My alpine strawberries,''
and ''My marrows''. Note that it is never used in conjunction with the
words ''blisters, hay fever, sciatica, pesticide poisoning''.
GLUTTONY: If there is anything more impressive than a Scotsman on the
make, it surely must be a gardener on the scrounge.
''I'll take a few cuttings, if you don't mind,'' really means: ''I'll
leave your garden looking like a Chernobyl landscape.''
As for, ''I've picked a bowl of your
strawberries/raspberries/blackcurrants,'' you're left wondering whose
bowl was used -- Goliath's, the Giant out of Jack and the Beanstalk,
Luciano Pavarotti's?
ANGER: For a long, peaceful and productive life, avoid the local
flower show like an attack of red spider mites. If located within
50-metre range of the Thwarted Gardener, you are in danger of suffering
from permanent hearing impairment on the announcement that the local
horticultural slob, who believes in a mulch of crisp packets, lager cans
and whatever else spills out of his bin bags, has been awarded Best in
Show, while his other half has scooped first prize in the dried flower
section for her striking arrangement of dockens, marestail, ragwort and
rosebay willow-herb.
LUST: This usually manifests itself when a new neighbour steps out to
do a spot of weeding, dressed in an outfit that would make Madonna look
positively overdressed. On occasion, the new neighbour may appear to be
a Chippendale on his day off. Potting shed conversations will be
littered with allusions to melons, fine pears and other such banalities.
SLOTH: This is where the hi-tech, near-millennium gardener comes into
his own. He's just got rid of his remote-controlled lawnmower on the
installation of astro-turf, while any area not occupied by polyvinyl yew
trees and plastic pot plants is covered with pastel-coloured paving.
Gates, garage doors, flood-lighting and even the barbecue grill can be
activated from the console built into his multi-positional electronic
sun-lounger beside the self-cleaning pool.
COVETOUSNESS: It may not be that he covets his neighbour's house, nor
wife, nor manservant nor even his ox and his ass, but the covetous
gardener is as green as a bunch of moss-curled parsley at the sight of
next door's state-of-the-art Ferrari-like machine that beats as it cuts
as it sweeps as it rakes as it trims as it manicures.
He will strenuously deny this sin on the grounds that everyone knows
that The Experts say that the perfect lawn finish is achieved by the use
of a hand-pushed, cylinder-type mower with no grass-box attached --
quite by coincidence identical to his own model.
ENVY: Probably the most degrading sin of all, especially when directed
at the gardener's own offspring, who is working a 10ft by 8ft corner for
his Cub-Scout gardening badge. The Envious Gardener has spent
approximately the price of two weeks in Barbados - spending money
included - on mail-order plants, exotic seeds, a year's subscription to
four separate gardening publications and a vast range of highly
expensive organic preparations to treat every soil, grass, vegetable,
flower, weed and pest condition known to man.
Our mini Baden-Powell, with two packets of free seed from his mother's
magazine and a liberal application of hope and hamsters' droppings, has
created a garden worthy of the local council's Garden of the Year
Trophy.

John Linklater reports that testosterone, far from fueling male anger,
enhances a sense of wellbeing.
TESTOSTERONE makes you nice. It makes you curl up like a teddy bear,
give a big benign yawn of contentedness and turn over to have your belly
tickled. You got the honey. You're the cat that licked the cream. Don't
let them tell you any different, not that you'd give anything except
your big testosterone smile.
Don't just take it from me. Listen to Dr Christina Wang of the
University of California in Los Angeles. She and her team were observing
a whole pile of ''negative emotions'' in a group of 54 male test cases.
These guys were edgy. They were angry. They were mean. They were all the
things that the usual cliche attributes to ''testosterone poisoning'' or
''testosterone overdose''. And that's what caused Dr Wang and her
researchers surprise. These men were selected because they were low in
testosterone.
The Californian scientists have their own scientific term for their
subjects, mildly insulting it has to be admitted. Their paper to the
recent annual meeting of the Endocrine Society described the test cases
as ''hypogonadal men'', which could be enough to rouse even the most
non-assertive fellow to teeth-grinding aggression. Which is maybe
exactly what happened, but it demonstrates that their behaviour was not
caused directly by testosterone.
History backs up this finding. The last two centuries confirm that it
is always the little guy, let's face it -- the little hypogonadal guy,
that starts all the trouble. He lusts to conquer territories by the
continent and erect thousand-year reichs. Some deficiency, clearly, as
the post-mortems on Napoleon and Hitler confirmed. It wasn't just the
Little General that was little about Napoleon, and if Hitler producing
any hormones at all, he was doing it on only one cylinder. Some
testosterone therapy might have saved millions of innocent lives.
You don't have to be an England-internationalist, rugby prop-forward
to personify a terrible inadequacy, but it helps. All that sneering
malcontentedness, that blatant xenophobia and agreeing with the captain
about getting the freaks out of the game, because they are bigger, and
better, and stronger and more skilful, is not a product of testosterone,
but a severe case of lacking it.
Watch Jonah Lomu calmly walk all over them with serene contempt,
without checking stride, breaking sweat or even muddying his breeks. The
nearest the boy gets to aggression is in the haka before the game, and
it comes with the All-Black jersey. He has no choice. The rest is a
sweet stroll in the park. Nothing to prove, he smiles. He acts nice.
Awesome, but nice. Testosterone on the wing.
This is the point Dr Wang and her team were driving at. When they gave
their 54 hypogonadal angries a two-month course of testosterone
replacement therapy the tension level dropped immediately. The men
observed a sense of heightened optimism and friendliness. All their bad
attitude had evaporated.
What does this prove? It suggests that Ben Johnson was a lot easier to
live with when they took away his gold medal after drugs testing, than
when he was just another scrawny, little sprinter with mediocre times
and a lot of dust getting kicked up the track into his face. No wonder
all these Chinese swimmers and Bulgarian weightlifters risk their
careers by persisting with testosterone cheating. They just want to feel
nicer about themselves, put on a some muscle bulk and grow Desperate Dan
beards to impress the other girls with in the shower.
Nobody is saying that all that negative behavioural stuff doesn't
exist, like territorial aggression, male slavering and posturing,
swaggering, burping and farting, tribal-instinct football hooliganism,
lager loutism or the misanthropic impulse to pick up an electric guitar
and play heavy metal music all over people. All that we are asking is
don't blame it all on testosterone. That's just a case of slandering a
good hormone.
The fact is we all need that much-maligned androgen, men and women.
Females average 40 nanograms per decilitre of blood, males 10 times that
concentration. Yes, applied testosterone means deeper voices, bigger
bodies and hairiness, along with the care and maintenance of male
sex-organs. But pinning a whole series of annoying behavioural patterns
to it just betrays a hormonal antipathy towards anything to with the
idea of male.
Later this year the Gulbenkian Report is expected to support Dr Wang's
case by reiterating the obvious, that violence is not bred in the genes,
nor later by levels of testosterone, but by social and economic factors.
Equally, sexual harassment is all to do with power, not testosterone.
So, give the male hormone a break. Stop using testosterone as a
by-word for putting us down, a cliche that in recent years has taken
over in fashion from the sneering use of macho. Nothing reduces
testosterone more effectively than stress, and there is no stress more
acute than becoming one of Dr Wang's hypogonads. It's not bromide in the
tea we need, but a nice quiet spot out in that weekend sun to sprawl
contentedly, purring with friendliness and stretching out a big paw.

The creator of the Pookie books talks to Aileen Little.
IF ever there was a perfect synthesis between work and play, Ivy
Wallace's garden near Biggar is it. The 28-acre garden, largely
reclaimed from the woodland it nestles in, was the inspiration in the
fifties and sixties for two series of children's books which sold more
than a million copies worldwide.
Now in her 80th year, the author/illustrator is thrilled that her
books -- packed with natural history -- are enjoying a new lease of
life. One series, the Pookie books, is soon to be turned into 26
animated TV films; and Ivy is busy rewriting and illustrating all the
Pookie stories.
A white rabbit with wings, Pookie inhabits a bluebell dell -- the
inspiration for which Ivy planted on the wooded slopes fringing the
lawns. The task of landscaping the hillside was shared by her husband, a
former managing director of Collins publishers, whose offices in all
major Commonwealth countries ensured Pookie stories and merchandise
enjoyed an international following.
The real-life models for Ooly Owl, Squiffytail the red squirrel and
Wigglenose the rabbit all regard this beautiful natural sanctuary as
home. ''The pond as attracted a heron which stalks down the croquet lawn
as if he's reviewing the troops,'' says Ivy.
Of all the books, Pookie Puts The World Right is the most
environmentally right-on -- in it the need for different seasons is
explained. On the new cover (it was reprinted last year) Ivy painted
from nature a selection of plants which span the months.
For Pookie And His Shop, Ivy, who trained at Grimsby School of Art,
reproduced in watercolour one of the mighty tree stumps which experts
say are remnants of Scotland's ancient Caledonian forest.
''The shop is a trunk 50 yards from my porch. Some of the stumps have
roots so huge that my daughters Heather and Cherry used to play house in
them.''
Dominating the garden, the 70 ft Scots fir is featured in Pookie
Believes in Santa Claus, its boughs heavy with snow; and Pookie And The
Swallows (out next spring) recalls the years the girls delighted in
watching the birds nest in the porch.
The Pookie books are about to be translated into eight languages: he
is Sookie in Singapore and Pooshistc in Russian; and Pookie's Big Day
featuring Border hills on the cover is to be published in July. Ivy
Wallace, eloquent and lively as ever, counts herself very lucky.
''Fortunately I've still got fairly good eyesight and a steady hand.''
Luckiest of all was the discovery of a magnificent country house and
garden to fuel her fertile imagination.
''The garden and its position bought the house. I knew at once the
wood was the right place for Pookie and his friends to live in.''

* WITH a fearful crashing of gears, we were on our way. Novice minor
truckies for 48 hours. And the first battle was to persuade the long
wheelbase, two-and-a-half ton van to comply with our desire to shift it
into second gear. Just to confuse the issue further, all the gears were
arranged in opposite order to those of the car. What fun.
This little exercise kept the neighbours discreetly convulsed behind
the curtains, and marked the occasion of our son's elevation to
managerial ranks in the south, and the subsequent purchase of a house.
Unfortunately, the new young executive hadn't thought to try to
negotiate his removal costs, thinking that his few meagre possessions
from the flat he'd shared with some university friends, plus a motley
assortment of this and that from the parents, would take up little
space.
Meanwhile, back on the pavement, listening to the gearbox concerto and
watching the van doing a fair imitation of a kangaroo, our daughter and
son-in-law stood waving us off, trying not to laugh, and, they admitted
later, silently praying we would get there in one piece. If the take-off
was anything to go by, it was a miracle we reached the end of the road,
let alone England. At least by the time we made the first junction, the
van had allowed itself to be shifted into third gear.
Hauling the thing around unexpected little braes which a car wouldn't
even notice, and into tight corners, loaded to the gunnels, was . . .
challenging. By the time we stopped to change drivers, the offside
mirror had worked its way forward, giving an excellent view of the side
of the van and nothing else. Out leapt my husband, and impressed me no
end, delving into a pocket and whisking out first a lightbulb, then a
yellow duster. The bulb returned to his pocket, the duster was
elaborately knotted in place to hold the mirror, flapping merrily
alongside us like a pennant.
The motorways brought realisation of how different driving
characteristics are in a commercial vehicle. Every large truck which
hurled past left us rocking about disconcertingly in its wake, wrestling
with the steering wheel.
Approaching Birmingham, a convoy of breakfast cereal lorries, each
with a trailer sporting Krispies, Kornflakes and the like on their
curtain-sides, had brilliant fun racing each other downhill, leaving us
bobbing like corks. Obviously fully loaded, when they got to a hill,
they died a death, limping along in the slow lane when we were forced to
overtake them, until the descent came and off they went again.
To the car driver, commercial vehicles are often viewed -- sometimes
quite rightly -- as bully boys, and in wet weather thoroughly dangerous,
as they tear along spraying out gallons of surface water, rendering
other drivers almost blind.
But join their ranks and discover their consideration towards one
another, flashing their lights when it's safe to pull back in after
overtaking -- particularly helpful after the yellow duster finally
unknotted itself and took off into the night.
We got to our destination at 2.45am. Alas, we took a wrong turning
into a sleeping cul-de-sac. Suffice to say one doesn't sneak about in
the dead of night in a diesel van. By the time I negotiated something
like a ten-point turn between parked cars, it's unlikely that many of
the residents were still slumbering peacefully.
As we finally located the lad's door, he appeared, beaming: ''I had a
feeling it was you, well done!'' he announced discreetly, nary a word
that he'd been tracking our progress by ear no doubt, for the past ten
minutes.
A truckie's life for me? Never again.

Their names might not be big (yet) but their talents undoubtedly are.
Wendy Jack looks at the fine art students' degree show at Glasgow School
of Art. The works pictured carry no names or prices -- they were being
anonymously assessed when taken -- but could represent real bargains for
buyers.
WHAT do the following have in common? A giant mobile of baby clothes,
hung high, swaying gently in the breeze . . . two young sophisticates in
vibrant clothes, larger than life, staring boldly across a gallery,
confident, challenging . . . mini sculptures, tiny faces hewn from
turnip and embellished with spaghetti, with huge glassy marble eyes . .
. and paintings, abstract, figurative.
The common denominator is the Glasgow School of Art's (GSA) Fine Arts
degree show, where a surfeit of goodies is on offer, often at
bargain-basement prices, from #15 up to perhaps #500 -- and all highly
negotiable.
You could just pick up a masterpiece of the future from the displays
of paintings, sculptures, photography and videos, for example, but
investment should not be the motivating reason for buying, according to
Pavel Buchler, head of the GSA's fine art department.
''I'd like to encourage people to think in terms of buying an artwork,
as opposed to say, buying a picture.''
With work by 101 undergraduates and 23 postgraduates on display, plus
portfolios of drawings, Buchler reckons there are probably well over
1000 pieces, most for sale.
He explains why one student's work, a series of square paintings of
solid colour -- apparently simplistic in the extreme to the layman --
demonstrates ''real achievement. I have a lot of sympathy with students
who make their lives difficult. The difficulty is in the kind of
conviction and consistency of the work.'' But do you really need several
years at art school to paint something in a plain colour?
''Yes, you do. I would very much encourage people to take a good look
at these things, I'm not saying it's everyone's cup of tea. As we all
like different kinds of music, so it is in art.
''What I see in a body of work like this is a real achievement, a
student who started with the same doubts as you might be expressing. I
have been convinced that he or she understands what painting is about.''
Closer inspection reveals that within the block of apparently plain
colour, there is both texture and another colour. The suspended drips,
dried for posterity, are apparently another masterly touch. Touche.
Such shows, Pavel Buchler believes, present an opportunity to ''buy
something that you perhaps doubt a little, because the price is
affordable. Thinking in terms of something being a future good
investment isn't what people should have in mind.''
Once that premise is forgotten, he says, ''it frees the mind; it
should be something you want to live with.''
Amassing a little collection of affordable artworks over the years
''should be one's ambition'', says Buchler. ''Because what you get is a
record of your own kind of growth.''
If, a year later, you still find, as Buchler has done, that the
painting bought from a student for #40 is fresh, rewarding you with
daily delight, you've chosen well. A special magic that works for you.
* The Fine Art Degree Show runs from today until Friday June 30 in
Room 24 of the Mackintosh Building, 167 Renfrew Street, Glasgow.

They could be right. 'Furniture made out of old church items is
architectural in quality and satisfies the spirit,' says the man who
gives the time-served pew new life.
IF YOU like the idea of using reclaimed wood, an enterprising company
called Pew Corner might have something to interest you.
Started eight years ago ''by happy accident'', Pew Corner operates
from a barn in Surrey turning unwanted church furniture into stylish
modern pieces.
''It all began because I wanted a pew for my own home,'' says Mark
Groes, the owner. ''We've come a long way from then. Now we are the
biggest company in the world, so far as we know, dealing exclusively
with reclaimed church furniture.''
Pews, chairs, panelling, screens, balcony fronts and other items come
on to the market when churches are re-ordering, refurbishing or closing
buildings altogether. Mark is often the first to hear about them, having
made quite a reputation in church circles. The contents of every church
must go out to competititve tender and Pew Corner goes to at least two
churches every week.
''Sometimes we are looking at just half-a-dozen pews,'' says Mark,
''sometimes 100 chairs, occasionally the entire contents. Often our
purchases come from thriving churches -- it's simply that the heavy
Gothic look is not felt to be appropriate any longer and many churches
prefer the flexibility of chairs rather than fixed pews.''
Pew Corner has cleared churches in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and
Perth, although it is, as Mark points out, a long way to come. His team
drives to the church, dismantles pieces as required, then takes the
furniture back to their large store in Surrey.
Stock is vital to the business, and as churches are their only source,
they need to buy as often as possible. It can, of course, be quite
upsetting when men move in with chainsaws, and Mark advises parishioners
to stay away.
But like it or loathe it, Mark's work is the answer to many a
clergyman's prayer. ''I have absolutely no regret over dismantling
churches,'' he says. ''We never, ever try to persuade a church to sell
its furniture to us. We find a new use for it to allow churches to
refurbish or fill a new need. If fittings cannot be sold, they are
simply burned. What a waste that would be.''
Back at the workshops, the designers, joiners and cabinetmakers get to
work. Very little of the furniture remains intact. Most of it is
restructured and refinished or dismantled be used in other furniture.
Much of the furniture goes to trade customers for seating and tables
in cafes, for reception areas or for creating cosy corners in pubs.
Boardrooms, doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms and office reception
areas are common sites for Pew Corner furniture, but there are lots of
many domestic customers too. Much of the attraction is the marvellous
patina from the old wood, polished and tended over the years, sometimes
over several centuries; but the other attraction of the reclaimed
furniture is the cost.
It's not that Pew Corner furniture is cheap but, as Mark Groes says,
''it's like selling pound notes for 50p. We may sell a piece of
furniture made from a heavily-carved oak pulpit for something in the
region of #1000, but you would not be able to commission something
similar now for less than #10,000 -- even if you could find a craftsman
with the skills to produce such high-quality work.
''You have to remember that church furniture was the best quality work
that could be produced at the time -- and indeed, that is still true.
Furniture made out of old church items is architectural in quality and
seems to satisfy the spirit.''
The most commonly found woods are oak and pitch pine. Prices start at
around #15 to #25 for chairs (usually beech framed with elm seats) and
with a pocket on the back for hymn books. These chairs are enormously
popular -- Pew Corner sold around 2500 last year.
A pair of matching lattice-carved seven-foot sofas made from a pine
balcony front, complete with heavy feather-filled cushions, sold at only
#1200 each, while a matching 10-foot sideboard would cost in the region
of #2200, depending on the amount of internal work involved.
A plain four-foot pew will cost around #180 to #340, with a
top-of-the-range oak pew with arched back selling at #1500.
Furniture can be custom made. Pew Corner's catalogue shows dressers
and beds designed to fit the most awkward spaces.
If you can't make it down to the Surrey showroom, which is open on
Friday and Saturday from 10-5 or during the week by appointment,
catalogues and price lists are available. As well as larger items they
sell candlesticks, communion rails, fonts, flooring, lecterns,
panelling, screens, statues, umbrella stands and windows.

SHE was on her knees and her hair was in two colours. This was not one
of those erotic homecomings you get in the American sitcoms, with canned
laughter. This was a doom-laden homecoming, for she was colourwashing
the tongue-and-groove panelling, and the colours in her hair were blue
and white. And before we go any further, there's nothing remotely erotic
about tongue-and-groove panelling: the name must have been dreamed up by
a fantasist.
''We're going for the natural look,'' she said. ''I decided this
morning just after you left. I thought I'd start by giving a distressed
effect to the panelling. How d'you feel about it?'' Distressed, I said.
And I was. I'd heard about this natural look before, and it's harder
work and just as expensive as the good, old-fashioned, time-proven
unnatural look. We are liable to end up with rickety old dressers,
complete with authentic if long-vacated woodworm holes, and one of those
stoneware butler sinks designed to smash crockery unforgivingly. Maybe
we should put back the lead plumbing while we were at it?
''Natural,'' I said, pulling the dictionary from my briefcase (I do
the crossword in the train). ''Pertaining to, produced by, or according
to nature: not miraculous: not the work of a man: not interfered with by
man.''
''Look,'' she said, quoting from memory. ''To seem to be: to have an
appearance: to give (a look as a cognate object).'' I started to look up
''cognate'' surreptitiously, but desisted. I could see I was losing the
argument, so I went off to find my paint-spattered boiler suit and
cursed the day when some trendy London decor poseur decided we should
sit around in houses that look as if they've been rented from a miser.
On my knees, distressing gloomily, I thought about the many synonyms
for natural. Crosswords do this to you. We could have:
The Organic Look, in which the house interior is treated to look like
a cave (the Fred Flintstone option).
The Wild Look, in which, as well as house-plants, you have
house-weeds, keep the floor strewn with pine needles and never have to
vacuum.
The Spontaneous Look, in which you change everything around each day
according to your mood, a terrifying prospect.
The Normal Look, which . . . Hey, I thought, that's what we had when I
left for work this morning.
I said: ''Would you like me to explain a logical course of reasoning
that proves we're wasting our time?'' No, she said, but thanks anyway.

Made-to-order cotton lace mixes delicacy with strength, says Joanna
Swanson
THINK of lace curtains and you may well think of greying nets,
unlovely and uninspiring. Yet city living often calls for some form of
screening for windows, either to provide privacy or to mask an
unattractive view.
Real cotton lace curtains and panels are becoming an increasingly
popular solution to the problem, and besides being able to take pleasure
in the fresh, frothy appearance of crunchy cotton lace, owners have the
satisfaction of knowing their purchase is supporting a traditional
Scottish industry.
Newmills, Darvel, and Galston in the Irvine Valley have been a centre
for lace-making in Britain since the late nineteenth century, when power
lace looms revolutionised the Ayrshire textile industry. Many of those
looms are still in use, although designs and fashions have changed
dramatically.
While traditional two-tone lace and the well-loved bell, ribbon, and
rose motifs are still appreciated, the fresh and inspired designs of
companies like Anna French and Laura Ashley have played a major part in
reviving interest in genuine cotton lace.
Anna French became intrigued by the decorative potential of Scottish
cotton lace in 1976, when the industry was in the doldrums and interest
in lace curtains low. She and her husband John moved to Kilmarnock and
set up business in Ayrshire, where she began designing a collection of
original laces unrivalled in the industry.
Anna French Ltd has since relocated to London and built up a
reputation for bright, original, and elegant fabrics and wallpapers, but
the company still works with lacemaking factories in Ayrshire to produce
the designs that made its name.
One of the company's strengths is that, while designs such as Ribbons
and Ascot Bows in cotton lace make delightful use of traditional motifs,
Anna French has not unafraid to produce unconventional, contemporary
designs. The Spot and Diamond cotton madras fabrics are, as their names
suggest, woven in strong, simple geometric patterns -- yet both designs
complement the material's delicacy.
Intricate and gentle on the eye, but no less modern, are the Leaf
design in cotton lace and Daisy in cotton madras. Leaf is a densely
patterned design of vine leaves, complete with grapes and curling
tendrils, while Daisy has minute, stylised flower heads scattered across
a plain background.
At the opposite end of the scale from Daisy's pastoral, very English
feel, the intriguing Bengali Birds design shows a strong Indian
influence. Varied as they are, Anna French's laces and muslins share an
inspired approach to making fresh interpretations of a traditional
fabric. Anna French lace and muslins are available at stockists
throughout Scotland. Prices vary from #25 per metre.
Laura Ashley has a range of Scottish-made pure cotton lace, including
the fresh, simple Daisy Trellis and the more elaborate Ribbons and Bows
designs. Their laces complement a range of pretty voiles and madras
muslin and are available by the yard or as made-to-order curtains and
festoon blinds.
The festoon blinds are supplied fully strung and attached to a rail,
ready to hang. They come with an acorn pull to hold the blind at the
correct height, and they can be made to sit inside or outside the window
recess. Prices range from #139 for a window 91 by 130cm to #182 for a
window 244 by 170cm. The lace curtains can be made in widths from 152 to
195cm and lengths from 50 to 305cm. They cost from #119 to #210 the
pair.
Laura Ashley also makes a ready-made lace panel in Ribbons and Bows
lace, priced at #29.95 to fit a window 150 by 229cm.

* CLEVER use of paints and wall coverings will create a calm, relaxing
look in your home, providing the ideal backdrop for natural furnishings
and fabrics.
The new Naturals range of vinyl matt paints by Dulux is inspired by
natural fibres and fabrics and will give a soft and subtle atmosphere.
These paints have been designed to complement each other as well as
other deeper colours from the Dulux range. The range has six shades:
linen, hessian, calico, bamboo, raffia and wicker. It costs #11.99 for
2.5 litres and is available in three finishes: vinyl matt, vinyl soft
sheen and vinyl silk.
On larger expanses of walls, you may wish to pick out woodwork, dado
rails or cornicing in a slightly different shade. If you are worried
that you are going to end up with a washed-out look, choose a warmer
colour, such as Spice Island by Dulux on alcoves, chimney breasts or
skirting boards. This will make a subtle contrast and give your room
warmth and depth.
To make creating your new natural look even easier, Dulux has
developed a helpful Colour Testers Booklet featuring the full range of
colours. You can also buy a small tester pot which will give you enough
paint to cover an area about A4 size either on a section of your wall or
a piece of white card.

We're not out of the wood yet. In fact, we're happily treading the
boards again with the new Natural Look, writes Helen Brown.
THERE'S a lot to be said in favour of an unadorned wooden floor. It
might cost a bit more than a fitted carpet, but to asthma sufferers or
those bothered by allergies caused by house mites and household dust,
the bare-boarded room could well be the answer.
Also, for those who dislike the idea of breeding cat fleas in the shag
pile, a wooden floor has obvious advantages.
But it's not entirely for those reasons that we are getting back to
trading the boards. It's because the fashionable trend towards natural
products has re-boosted the appeal of wooden floors.
But what about the precious trees? you cry. Today's manufacturers have
been at pains to stress their commitment to the environment, so you need
have no worries about denuding tropical rainforests.
There are only a handful of flooring specialists in Scotland --
outside of trade suppliers -- who sell and fit such floors for the
domestic market. And although the biggest market share still belongs to
the DIY stores selling lay-it-yourself parquet mini blocks, if you want
something that looks truly exceptional and is likely to last longer than
you do, it will pay you to go to the pros.
The Wood Floor Centre at Newcraighall in Edinburgh offers sound advice
and has a well laid out showroom where you have a chance to see what a
reasonably extensive piece of the flooring really looks like.
''It can be hard to visualise what your room might look like with one
of these floors,'' says Martin Smith of the Wood Floor Centre. ''A
carpet can help to give you a new colour scheme, but a wooden floor will
transform the character of your room. You have only to look at the chain
stores who choose wooden floors for their shops -- and ask yourself why
they choose them rather than vinyl or tiles. Not only is wood durable
and practical, it feels good to walk on, looks natural rather than
scruffy when it becomes well trodden, and gives a feeling of warmth and
homeliness.''
If you are worried that a wooden floor will not be as warm as a
carpet, think again. Wood is an insulator and a well fitted floor will
stop all draughts. Many modern floor types are laid on a cushioned
underlay, providing yet another layer of insulation. And they look even
better when you scatter round a few bright rugs of your favourite colour
and style.
Be prepared to ask for professional advice. Every manufacturer
produces floors in a range of width, thicknesses and finishes.
My own Victorian house had suffered considerable wear over the years
and the subfloor was uneven and creaky. The advice given to me was to go
for the thickest quality, nailed down rather than ''floated'' on
underlay to avoid a potentially damaging seesaw effect.
Kitchens and bathrooms will require an extra coat or two of lacquer to
help avoid water damage, and choose one of the harder woods -- maple or
oak, for instance -- for areas which will get heavy wear. You can choose
to be creative and go for stripes or patterns using different colours of
wood, but be very sure that you will not tire of these quickly.
There are more subtle effects to be considered: you can lengthen a
short hallway by running the strips along it rathern than across it or
give an open plan look by continuing the floor through several rooms.
You should use a bigger strip in a big room -- small strips can look
very fussy. It's perfectly possible to lay your own floor, but with such
a high-cost material it's worth spending the extra to get the job done
professionally to ensure an even finish.
These floors are popular with the brave souls who build their own
houses, not least because they are considered ''structural'' and can be
VAT exempt (but, sadly, this will not apply when you are putting one
into an old house).
Take a tip, though, and never install the floor on a ''green screed''
such as wet concrete. Moisture is the biggest enemy of a wooden floor --
and indeed, one of the great joys is that to clean them you need only a
damp cloth, not a sopping mop and messy buckets of water.
''Providing the seal is maintained, the floor will continue to look
good and the hardwood itself will last indefinitely,'' says Colin
Sturgeon, secretary of the Pre-finished Hardwood Manufacturers
Association.
''Hardwood floors are very cost effective over time -- and if
necessary, after many years of service, can be totally rejuvenated by
resanding and sealing.''
The Pre-finished Hardwood Manufacturers Association was formed to
assist UK manufacturers to promote the use of this type of flooring to
all sectors of the building industry.
It provides, through its members, a comprehensive support service to
specifiers and flooring contractors in relation to product selection,
installation and maintenance. It also makes sure that its members supply
products which conform to the highest standards of manufacture and
quality. Members are: Bruce Hardwood Floors (UK) Ltd, Junckers Ltd,
Kahrs (UK) Ltd and Tarkett Ltd.

* WHEN choosing fabrics and accessories from the naturals palette you
have to combine textures and patterns to achieve maximum impact.
Next Interiors stocks a range of natural fabrics and upholstery
inspired by ''warm sand, pebbles on the beach and sun-bleached stones''.
The range includes plain fabrics in linen mix, oatmeal cotton canvas or
patterned materials with checks, stripes and flowers to suit
contemporary and classic tastes alike.
Modern sofas and chairs are big, boxy and comfortable, and complement
the natural look perfectly. Next, Habitat and Ikea all stock an
impressive choice of upholstery fabrics. Team with dhurries and cushions
for ultimate comfort and style.
There are many throws available in the High Street stores at the
moment. The best of the natural bunch include a soft cream chenille
tassle throw from Bhs #40, Next's waffle check throw in natural, #29.99,
and Marks and Spencer's cream throw, #35.
A scattering of cushions completes the look. Next's cord button
cushions in natural and sand, #15.99, and Bhs embroidered cushions,
linen cushions with ties and two-button silk cushions, #17, are good
value for money. Don't be afraid to combine patterns as they add depth
to a very plain room. If you stick to the basic tone, you can't go
wrong.
A hand-woven rug like Ikea's Nasby rag rug in beige looks great on
polished wooden floors. Coir matting is durable and practical. Ikea's
Vasby coir mat starts at #29 and Next's at #29.99. Both come with a
choice of tape edging and are latex backed.
House of Frasers' Kyam collection of dhurries are woven from the
finest Indian wool on a sturdy jute base. The rugs are beautifully soft
yet hard-wearing, and come in pastel geometric patterns. Prices start at
#49.99.
Ikea's Natural Cotton selection is more than just a name -- they are
also environmentally friendly. All the textiles in the range are
produced without chlorine. The range includes a selection of bed linen
and towels. Plain dyes and muted patterns combine to create a light airy
feel.
New from the Dorma bed linen Surpeme range is Linen Leaf, a youthful
contemporary design made from 100% cotton in natural tones. The design
is fully reversible to create two distinct looks. The first features a
patchwork style of loosely drawn squares etched with leaves and daisies.
The reverse is a tossed leaf design with chalky outlined leaves and
flowers. Prices start at #32.50 for a single quilt cover. The entire
range is available from the House of Fraser.
A touch of black will give any natural room a focal point. Wrought
iron candlesticks are perfect. Next's candlestick with candle costs
#15.99 and is an elegant addition to most rooms. Bhs lighting features
the stylish Scala, and for the dining room their Troon 5-light looks
stunning.
Parchment and paper shades are popular at the moment. Paper lantern
shades are now available in all shapes and sizes, and are very
inexpensive at around #3-#5 each. Marks and Spencer's parchment shades
with trim cost #12.
Blinds and curtains should accentuate natural light. Cream curtain
lining is cheap and handy for a simple window treatment, but make sure
it is pre-shrunk. Next's sand canvas curtain is a heavier fabric and
costs just #7.99.
Blinds are the ideal solution for smaller windows which may be swamped
by curtains. Ikea's selection has something for everyone. Their YTA
natural roller blind is 100% acrylic-coated cotton and starts at #18.
Epsilon wooden venetian blinds start at #39 and Bambu roll-up blinds a
mere #3.95.

IT WAS a quintessentially British moment, fully in keeping with the
ancient grandeur, tacky self-regard, and low comedy of our island story.
As is traditional, the news bulletins were each extended. This was
Gesture Television.
Scrap the running order! excited men in bad ties were telling one
another. John Major has decided to run against himself for the
leadership of the Conservative Party! Can he win? Can we care? Can we
squeeze enough asinine nonentities into the studio to pad out all this
extra air-time we've given ourselves?
Television is obliged by acts of Parliament to unite the nation at
times such as these. On Thursday evening it probably united the nation
sufficiently to send it to the pub until Hurricane Baloney had blown
over.
Your reviewer, dutiful to the end, remained at his post and watched
each and every news broadcast. He wouldn't say no to a small medal.
Plainly, the entire panto was staged to catch the TV news. Major may not
have wasted his breath on the print hacks -- and who would? -- but he
allowed the grandees of televisual twaddle all the time they needed to
give him the chance to advertise himself. The fix was in, and none were
to be spared.
Thus it was that barely a moment passed, as Channel 4 News became the
Nine O'Clock, then News at Ten, then Newsnight, without someone saying
how brave and daring Major was being. No-one quite got round to asking
what gives this petulant little man the right to remain Premier while
his party sorts itself out. No-one really asked where bravery came into
it, what with the entire executive of the 1922 Committee squared and the
Cabinet bastards placed under oath.
The point is, I think, is that TV (faithfully mimicked, as usual, by
the papers) didn't really care. Major had staged a clever stunt and
that, for all concerned, was sufficient to the day.
The fact is that each of those extended bulletins amounted to the same
five-minute report repeated ad (and some way beyond) nauseam. Major's
Downing Street garden party became so familiar you could almost smell
the journalists. But no hard questions were asked even of those -- the
Gormans, Taylors, Budgens and the like -- whose very existence seemed to
demand it.
They had wanted this battle: would they stand and fight? Answer came
there none, hour after hour. You knew the barrel was being scraped --
for it is an infallible sign -- when Mellor appeared. Bring on, as David
Niven was wont to say, the empty horses.
Failing that, bring on the shameless reactionaries. Quite the funniest
moment of the week came in the middle of a very serious programme.
''Trust doesn't come into it,'' said the noble Alan Clark describing the
ways of government, for all the world as if some other former Minister
had just been accused of having taken part in a deliberate campaign to
mislead Parliament.
Myths and Memories of World War Two (BBC2, Tuesday) turned on a
premise increasingly popular among the sort of historians who went mad
during the cold war. To wit: Churchill, who cared more about power than
his country, threw away the chance to make peace with Germany in 1941,
squandering half a million lives and the nation's treasure in the
process.
Fantastic?
There were several bits of nonsense involved. One was that Hitler was
sincerely interested in peace. Another was that he would have allowed
little Britain to keep its empire in exchange for Europe. A third was
that the world would have been a better place if he had succeeded in
conquering the USSR.
A fourth was that the freedom of Europe was none of our concern. A
fifth -- and perhaps the most hideous of all -- was that the Final
Solution was not ''properly'' under way in 1941, and therefore our moral
obligation to six million Jews did not then exist.
Watching this squalid little piece you were reminded that in Germany
they lock up people who deny the reality of the Holocaust. Here we put
people like Clark in Government, turn them into ''characters'', and
allow them air-space. Guess who won the war?
Murray Grigor's Fakelore (ITV, Sunday) was a long overdue and slightly
overlong assault on the commodification of history, specifically the
sort of heritage tat with which Scotland is fast becoming infested.
From archaeological sites ploughed under for motorways, to the
''re-authentication'' of Burns's Cottage, to the absurdity of a
restaurant planted on Edinburgh Castle (the centre of the capital being
bereft of places to eat) Grigor picked off, whether they realised it or
not, both a market-driven cultural establishment and the sort of
theorists who question elitism while exhibiting it to the full.
This was a quietly polemical piece, trading both on Grigor's past
essays on architecture and Scotch myths while asserting, or so it seemed
to me, a simple truth: somewhere along the line we have to reclaim the
right to say what is good and true and what is garbage.
There are no definitive historical arguments but the attempt at
definitive statements is what history, that continuing process, is made
of. Fakelore was one: Scotland is being turned into a visitor's centre,
tourists for the use of, and no-one is doing a thing about it. If this
was happening in the Third World we would call it exploitation.
Last week I meant to say some mildly kind things about the last proper
instalment of the Late Show. Due to what we call an ''error in
transmission'' (terror in emission, more like) words of praise for Donny
O'Rourke's piece on the poet Frank O'Hara became lodged half-way up a
wholly unrelated paragraph. Let's try it one more time: even when it was
awful the Late Show was worth having; even when it was maddeningly
pretentious it at least took the arts seriously. I'll miss it.
One final thought: if the show was sufficiently important to merit
three full nights of self-congratulatory flashbacks this week, why are
they killing it off?

ROBERT HERDMAN was born at Rattray on September 17, 1829, the youngest
of the parish minister's four sons. The idea of entering the ministry
was considered and discarded. Painting became Herdman's dominant
interest, and, in June 1847, he began six years' study at the Trustees'
Academy in Edinburgh, latterly under the inspiring direction of Robert
Scott Lauder.
After winning the Keith Prize in 1854, Herdman determined to visit
Italy but he lacked money. Lauder, however, wrote recommending his
ability and enthusiasm with the happy result that the Royal Scottish
Academy agreed to commission him to make copies of Masaccio's frescoes
in Florence. He was able to spend a year abroad.
Soon after his return he married and his life became set in an
attractive pattern of regular visits and long summer holidays to places
of national beauty.
In the summer of 1864 he first visited Arran, returning there year
after year. The Rowan Tree of 1872 was begun there on his first visit.
The rich autumnal colouring and peaceful preoccupation of the two
children, absorbed in the threading of a berry necklace, give it an
engaging and happy atmosphere. The composition is a reworking, with the
more disquieting elements eliminated, of Millais's Pre-Raphaelite
picture The Blind Girl. All of Lauder's pupils seemed to have succumbed
to the influence of Millais. In Herdman's case it was temporary, and did
not lead him to sacrifice his rich colour and painterly effects to the
scarifying brilliance and mosaic of crystalline detail often seen in the
work of Pre-Raphaelite followers.
Herdman was also a very effective portraitist with a range extending
from the charm and beauty of Lady Shand to the highly individualised and
strongly characterised heads of elderly gentlemen.
Artistic life in Scotland revolved round the Scottish Academy. Herdman
became an Associate in 1858 and a full Academician in 1863. He normally
also showed one or two pictures at the Royal Academy in London. These,
together with the Glasgow Institute, were the main shop windows for
Scottish artists.
The exhibitions, where hundreds of paintings competed for public
attention, were not the only possible outlets. Another was the
production of small pictures made specifically for engraving. The Royal
Association for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Scotland issued its
subscribers regularly with volumes of engravings, many of them
illustrations to Scott. Between 1863 and 1878 Herdman contributed
illustrations to 12 RAPFAS volumes. In 1869 he received another major
commission from the Association, for a subject of his own choice
''capable of furnishing a powerful and effective engraving'', to be
issued to subscribers for five guineas. The subject Herdman selected,
After the Battle -- a Scene in Covenanting Times, was not based on any
literary source. It was intended to be, as a story, fully
self-explanatory. Such was the acclaim of the painting that the
Association unanimously decided to buy it for presentation to the newly
created National Gallery of Scotland.

BARBARA BRYAN limbers down after the school's annual flat race by
reliving the ups and downs of her outings on the field of dreams,
upholding the family name, and a few other things besides
MY CHILDREN'S school has just had its annual sports day. I remember
when they first started at the school a friend said ''you'll love the
sports day,'' and I do.
There's lots of participation from the parents and teachers. When I
joined a five-legged race with two other mothers, we had such problems
trying to get into sync with one another, never mind think of a running
rhythm, I laughed so much I wished I had been more diligent about
practising my pelvic-floor exercises!
The gladiator-baiting crowds of the colosseum have nothing on the
lines of parents exhorting their progeny, or the official and unofficial
coaches who berate the laggards.
Although the school is not keen to encourage over-competitiveness, my
middle child was up days before the event at dawn running round the
block several times just to get into training. I know how she feels.
Last year one teacher had been giving my eldest a hard time, so when
it came to the flat race for mothers and teachers (I almost said
''toddlers'') I made sure my new trainers were twitching appropriately
at the starting line.
Halfway through the race though, my concentration was severely
affected. The elastic round the waist of my leggings had obviously
expanded at some point, and they started to slip down. Hoisting them up,
I clutched the elastic, and continued running as if my career depended
on it. As I sprinted over the finishing line, I realised that was my
annual exercise over for the year. I think I won.
Before the races began this year, I felt slightly self-conscious in my
leggings. I had put them on hoping it would give me that little bit of
extra speed. I have put on some weight since giving up smoking and my
legs feel like walking blancmanges most of the time.
(I now go swimming once a week and perhaps the other swimmers wonder
why I immediately dive into the pool as soon as I'm out of the changing
cubicle. I only make such a rapid entrance because my body has developed
the pear-shape I used to laugh about in photographs before I had a
family). But I don't need to be reminded of my appearance.
Once, while journeying to the sports day in the back of a mum's car,
her little girl looked closely at my thighs and pronounced. ''You've got
fat legs.'' I smiled benignly at her. Minutes later she said ''You've
got really fat legs.'' Do I seriously need this for my confidence when
I'm exposing my physique to the whole school in the annual flat race?
Another year they had an obstacle race for parents and teachers. It
involved leaping through hoops, vaulting over the gym horses, sprinting,
and wriggling through rubber tyres. A friend, who was inadvertently
wearing a skirt at the time, got stuck in one of the rubber tyres
(temporarily denting her dignity). And by the end of the race half the
parents looked as though they needed artificial resuscitation, it was a
wonder nobody contacted the local ambulance service. (It was probably
during that unexpected exertion that I first thought of giving up
smoking.)
Like many people, I had led an extremely sedentary existence. A friend
once tried to persuade me to go regularly to the gym, and when I
declined she said ''Well, it's up to you if you want your body to rot!''
But I could never be serious about body-building and, frankly, when I
think of jogging I can only remember that the first person to write a
successful book on the subject died of a heart attack while out jogging
one morning (presumably at dawn). So I don't even feel guilty when I see
these incredibly lean people pacing themselves and swearing profusely on
their daily exertion.
My husband also leads a sedentary existence. His only real exercise is
walking occasionally. Up and down the stairs, walking to the car,
walking out of the car, and into his office seat. Once he did get
serious about it -- just once. He bought some hi-tech skipping ropes and
skipped furiously every morning until he thought he was going to drop.
Thinking he would eventually drop, he changed tack and purchased an
exercise rowing-machine through a catalogue. It arrived and he duly
assembled it. He sat on the seat, which was on roller blades, extend his
arms to the bracket at the front and then pulled as hard as he could.
Clunk. The seat skited off, and his bottom thudded on to the floor. His
buttocks were so firmly wedged into the brackets that, when he tried to
get up, he took the whole thing with him.
So, as the years progress, and they certainly seem to be doing that
rather rapidly recently, I still procrastinate about leading a
physically healthy existence. Still, by the time I reach my three-score
years and 10 maybe they will have motorised the zimmers.

DON'T handle the fruit . . . because you don't have to. This
look-no-hands technology is a fruit picking robot which knows what it's
doing, and has an ever so gentle touch.
Developed at Silsoe Research Institute, the mart robot is capable of
handling uniform components. Robots in horticulture and agriculture face
different challenges. They must recognise the fruit that's ready for
picking and ignore the rest. They have to handle objects with irregular
shapes which can often be delicate, like mushrooms. Also they have to be
tough enough to work in dirty and hostile conditions.
Using image capture and analysis systems the robotic mushroom
harvester uses a specially designed vision system to locate the position
and size of the fungi. It works by distinguishing between the contrast
and shape of mushrooms and the compost on which they grow. A video
camera gives images in 256 levels of grey which is then analysed by
computer. A complex programme then selects the order of picking.
The cute mech-harvester then goes ahead and picks each mushroom
without even disturbing its neighbour, with a touch as light as the
Artful Dodger.
The Silsoe researchers are also using image analysis techniques to
guide a low-cost robot manipulator which has a range of potential
applications including fruit and vegetable harvesting, pruning and
packaging. It has been used experimentally to identify tomatoes on a
bench, select and then pack them in appropriate containers.
Compared with more traditional automatic packers, the robot will offer
much more flexibility. The same arm will be able to handle a variety of
crops like peppers, tomatoes, apples and courgettes. Blemish detection
might also be possible. Eventually robots will probably tackle more
advanced operations like remote harvesting.
With luck, we will soon see the bramble picking robot which will
forever put an end to thorns in the fingers. A robot garden digger and
weeder would be nice, or failing that a touch-sensitive little robot to
massage the aches and pains in the lower back. Maybe that's too big a
step for science, but here on the Frontier, we can still dream of a
better world.

<HEADLINE>Queen to be asked to help save dog</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Queen is to be asked to intervene after a judge ruled yesterday
that a crippled, brain-damaged family pet was an American pitbull
terrier and condemned her to die by lethal injection.
The decision by Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, was met with shouts of
''shame'', ''disgrace'', and ''murderers'' from a packed public gallery.
Immediately after the case -- unofficially estimated to have cost the
taxpayer #25,000 -- top dog psychologist and defence witness Dr Roger
Mugford said he was ''flabbergasted'' at the result of the three-day
appeal hearing at Southwark Crown Court and would be taking the matter
to the monarch.
Eight-year-old Jessie was found by children wandering unmuzzled and
unleashed in central London's Hyde Park 15 months ago, after being
accidentally abandoned by her owner. Dr Mugford had told the court the
dog had been wrongly branded a pitbull by police and the RSPCA.
There was no doubt, he insisted, that she was a Staffordshire bull
terrier, which shares a common ancestry with the American breed.
Outside the court, Dr Mugford, a leading expert on dog aggression,
said: ''This country is not fit for a dog safely to walk in a Royal park
without being set upon by the totally obsessed RSPCA inspectors.''
He said it was the worst case he had come across since the Dangerous
Dogs Act came into force in 1991.
Dr Mugford, who was once called to Buckingham Palace to treat two
corgis, continued: ''Great Britain will be the pariah of the dog world.
''I will be taking the matter up with the Queen. She will be very
disturbed to know what has been done in her name.''
The court heard that Jessie's owner, Mr Mark O'Brien, 33, who was
given the dog some years ago, was convicted last December at Bow Street
Magistrates Court of infringing the act by allowing the dog to stray in
a public place without a muzzle or a leash.
He was fined #150 and heard Jessie receive a mandatory death sentence.
Yesterday, in an emotional reunion, Mr O'Brien, of Beasant Way,
Neasden, north-west London, was able to stroke his dog for the last time
after she was brought to court as part of his fight to save her.
Outside the court, Mr O'Brien said he was ''completely disgusted'' but
not surprised at the court's decision.
''I am also disgusted at the RSPCA's involvement. I always thought the
RSPCA stood for prevention of cruelty to animals but as a result of
their involvement my innocent crippled dog, with no teeth, has been
condemned to die.''
Mr O'Brien, who works for the Retired Greyhound Trust on a voluntary
basis, added: ''I won't get to see Jessie again.''
The judge ordered unemployed Mr O'Brien to pay #250 contribution to
the prosecution costs of #750.
Mr Trevor Cooper, his solicitor, said they would consider the judgment
carefully to see if there was ''any room for manoeuvre'' for appeal.

FEAST your eyes, bikers. Drool if you like. You will not, definitely
not, see this bike parked outside the Carbeth Inn on a summer's night.
This baby ain't for amateurs, tyre kickers or weekend Angels.
It's the Apache Warrior, a prototype of bikes to come, envisaged by
New World Design for the Apache Motorworks Inc in Cleveland Ohio. It's
the result of three years' design and development, a custom concept bike
that is set to take the two-wheeled world by storm.
Researchers in the US believe that the current popularity of
thirties-style bikes will soon wane, Harley Davidson are already working
on a superbike. This is the response from a team who formed Apache last
year and already the notion has fired the imagination of the macho men
in the U S of A.
The ergonomics are the most advanced of any bike yet designed and it
can be tailored to the exact specifications of the owner. The designers
claim the unique suspension -- it dispenses with springs and uses a
series of adjustable air bladders to iron out shocks -- gives the
smoothest ride ever incorporated into a cruiser.
Technical details include state of the art ball and joint steering
system, rim-rider brakes, a 100-plus horsepower vibration damped engine
with as much capacity as that of a family saloon, five-speed box,
composite bodywork etc, etc. But enough of all that. The makers say it's
the most technically advanced motorbike ever. We believe them.
The $64,000 question is how much does it cost? And that's the answer,
give or take a grand. Still, we want one, we really do. Wonder if the
editor would consider . . .?

A TEAM of researchers from Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico,
has found a way to produce aerogels, the world's lightest solids, at
room temperature and pressure, thereby eliminating many of the hazards
and expense associated with conventional processing methods. Until now,
production of the super lightweight materials has required the use of
hazardous solvents and high temperatures and pressures.
Aerogels can be as much as 99.9 per cent air, making them almost as
light as air and nearly transparent. They are a far better insulator
than fibreglass and can support more than a thousand times their own
weight, ideal for use as components in spacecraft, building materials on
a space station, in sensors to detect chemical warefare agents, or as
super-insulation between window panes.
Implanting something in aerogel is as close as you can get to
suspending it in air, the scientists say. But the ''Holy Grail'' of
aerogel applications is developing invisible insulation for use between
window panes. Unfortunately, even the clearest aerogels are still a bit
murky.
* LOS Alamos National Laboratory scientists have devised a new method
for detecting the presence of explosives, one that sweeps up trace,
microscopic particles of an explosive, and spots the mini-flare created
when the particles burn in a heated chamber.
The method could easily be incorporated into portable or hand-held
devices that screen luggage, vehicles or people for explosives residue,
a ubiquitous contaminant of clandestine bomb builders, their workshops
and any objects they handle. The scientists recognised that because the
chemical structure of explosives allows them to burn rapidly, light
flashes from tiny, burning specks of explosives should produce a unique
optical signature.
* MICROBIOLOGISTS in Australia have discovered a bug which can destroy
the poisons in toxic algae. The notorious algae blooms spread in hot
weather and the poisons can cause fatal liver disease in livestock. It
is believed they are responsible for some types of liver cancer.
The Aussie scientists plan to grow the poison-guzzling bacteria in
bulk, freeze dry it and release it into waterways and treatment plants.

Moscow, Friday
RUSSIA'S Parliament lit the fuse for a political time bomb today when
it set July 1 for a confidence vote that could end in early elections.
The decision by the State Duma, the lower house, heightens the stakes
in a power struggle with President Boris Yeltsin. He has threatened to
dissolve Parliament and call early elections unless MPs support Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's Cabinet.
On Wednesday the MPs overwhelmingly passed a no-confidence vote in the
government, but that on its own had no effect under Russia's
constitution. A second vote against the Cabinet would set the sparks
flying.
To win the government would have to collect 226 votes in the largely
hostile house, which some observers see as unlikely.
''I am pretty sure the government will fail to rally enough votes to
win a vote of confidence,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai.
Chernomyrdin said today that he hoped for a peaceful solution to the
political crisis.
''I am sure we will find a way out suitable for all branches of
power,'' he said on a visit to the southern Russian city of Samara.
Defeat for the government on July 1 would set the constitutional
wheels in motion for Yeltsin either to sack Chernomyrdin or dissolve
Parliament and call new elections.
MPs are angry over the way Ministers handled the Chechen guerrilla
hostage crisis in the southern town of Budennovsk, in which at least 120
people were killed.
Yeltsin has made it clear that he will back the government, although
several key Ministers may be axed. That means Parliament may have to go.
Opposition parties, except for well-organised communists, appear
ill-prepared for early elections and an October poll could play into the
hands of Chernomydin's new centre-ground group.
When Chernomyrdin demanded a vote of support within 24 hours of
Wednesday's no-confidence resolution he ''turned the tables on the MPs
by using a mechanism they had not foreseen'', said one Western diplomat.
''They did not think through the consequences of their action and now
they are in a poor situation.''--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Blandford is arrested after being found slumped in car</HEADLINE>

THE Marquis of Blandford was arrested yesterday after a passer-by
found him slumped over the wheel of his car near a roundabout.
Blandford, 39, was taken to Oxford police station on suspicion of
driving under the influence of drink or drugs but refused to give
samples and was later released on police bail.
Inspector Dave Whitaker, of Thames Valley Police, said Blandford was
found near the village of Begbroke on the A44 around 1am. His car had
left the road.
Blandford was released at around 4am. A few hours later, he collected
his black Ford Escort RS Cosworth from Woodstock police station. The car
was undamaged.
It was the latest in a long list of brushes with the law for
Blandford, the son of the 11th Duke of Marlborough and a member of one
of Britain's most illustrious families.
He was sentenced to 30 days in jail in April for forging drug
prescriptions, and has several convictions for driving offences.
He has been stopped on several occasions this year by police concerned
about the way he was driving his Cosworth, capable of 138mph.
After his release from jail in April, Blandford was stopped by police
in London three times within a few hours and eventually charged with
driving without a seat belt.
Earlier this month, a warrant was issued for his arrest after he
failed to appear at City of London magistrates court on scooter riding
charges.
Friends hoped he would find stability after his marriage in 1990 to
Becky Few Brown, a 28-year-old kindergarten teacher and friend of the
Duchess of York. They parted after 18 months.
Two years ago, Blandford's estranged wife -- mother of the couple's
three-year-old son, George -- went to court over #10,000 unpaid
maintenance.
As High Court officials turned up outside his flat in west London,
Blandford fled, only to be arrested four days later.
Charges that he assaulted two officers during the arrest were dropped
after it was found that the warrant was invalid because it sought to
jail him for 112 days, instead of the maximum 42 allowed.
However, he spent three nights in jail before the judge discovered the
error and ordered his release.
He was back behind bars again briefly in April last year after he
failed to appear in court to face charges of deception.
He later spent three weeks in Brixton Prison after he failed to keep
appointments with probation officers.
In June last year, he was put on probation for 18 months and ordered
to attend a clinic for drug addiction.
The following month, his father won a legal action to ensure his
eldest son never gets control of the family seat, the #100m Blenheim
Palace estate.
Blandord remains entitled to live in the Oxfordshire palace until his
son George, the Earl of Sunderland, succeeds him as duke.

Sydney, Friday
THE anti-nuclear storm against France intensified today as Australia
recalled its envoy from Paris and South Pacific nations considered
putting the case against testing directly to the French people.
The Australian Government, under pressure to step up its opposition to
France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific, also
announced it would ban French naval ships and aircraft from Australian
ports.
As Prime Minister Paul Keating outlined the new measures, Australian
waterfront workers delayed the unloading of French ships and protests
were held across the region.
In Paris, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said only of the
Australian move to recall the ambassador: ''We take note of it.''
In the Cook Islands, which lie near the French coral island where the
underground tests are to be held, local women wearing grass skirts and
coconut-shell bras welcomed the arrival of environment group
Greenpeace's protest ship, Rainbow Warrior.
A crowd greeted the crew, who draped a banner reading ''Nuclear Free
Pacific'' from the ship, based in Auckland, New Zealand, and vowed to
try to stop the eight planned tests going ahead from September. A
protest march followed, supported by Cook Islands Premier Sir Geoffrey
Henry.
In New Zealand, which has condemned the French decision as a sign of
arrogant colonialism, protesters presented bags of rubbish and dead fish
to the French Embassy in Wellington. The material was accepted without
comment.
Australian protesters marched in the streets of Sydney and Brisbane,
joining environmental groups in urging their government to send a ship
into the test area and recall Australia's ambassador permanently.
Keating, outlining Australia's new measures, said the ambassador would
be recalled temporarily and that the 15-nation South Pacific Forum may
run an anti-nuclear publicity campaign in France itself. A forum
delegation to Paris this week made no headway.
''We've upped the ante with a significantly tougher range of measures
deliberately designed to send a very clear message to the French
Government and indeed the French people,'' said Australian Foreign
Minister Gareth Evans.
A publicity campaign could be run through staging exhibitions and
taking out advertisements in the media, a government statement said.
Australia also supported a boycott of the next South Pacific Games,
scheduled for the French territory of Tahiti in August, but this met a
mixed response from some South Pacific nations. Fiji wants a boycott,
but Cook Islands and Papua New Guinea have so far declined to back it.
South Pacific Forum Secretary-General Ieremia Tabai, a member of the
forum delegation to Paris, backed Australia's tougher stance.
''It is important because one of the reasons why we went to France is
to show our total opposition to the proposed testing,'' Tabai said.
The Australian Council of Trade Unions stepped up its anti-nuclear
campaign today, declaring its support for protests aimed at interfering
with the servicing of all French ships and aircraft.
French consuls around the country are under tight security after a
firebombing of the country's consulate in the western city of Perth last
Saturday.
Australia said it hoped Paris would not retaliate against its latest
moves, but Evans hinted that further steps could be taken. ''The
response today is not necessarily the final response,'' Evans told
reporters in Canberra.--Reuter.

THIS is the time of year to go north, to go Nordic, when the light
dims only briefly and is bright enough to read by for most of the night.
In the Nordic countries, these endless days compensate for dark winters,
and everyone makes the most of them. As well as the great Scandinavian
midsummer festivities, just past, with vast eating, drinking, and
dancing around the maypole, most Nordic countries have summer
celebrations galore.
A nickname for Copenhagen is the jazz capital of Europe and, over the
years, while jazz popularity has risen and fallen elsewhere, Denmark has
stayed faithful to jazz.
So what better for jazz lovers than the Copenhagen Jazz Festival from
July 7-16. During this packed fortnight, some 450 concerts will draw in
musicians from many lands to join local performers in making music day
and night.
Nowhere is the midnight sun more beautiful than in Tromso, Norway's
northern island city. Six years ago, the city began its Midnight Sun
Marathon (on July 1-2 this year) under the midnight sun.
For 1995, the Marathon Committee expect 5000 competitors from many
countries to run a full marathon, a 10km half-marathon, or a
mini-marathon.
In Stockholm, the four-year-old Water Festival has become amazingly
popular, with 370,000 Swedes and 60,000 overseas visitors taking part
last year. Now Stockholm is ready for the fifth festival from August
11-20, which will cover everything from water-skiing, swimming
competitions, and sailing in Stockholm's vast Lake Malaren, or out in
the archipelago, to rock-climbing and bungee-jumping, and symphony music
to street theatre. The spectacular finale, the World Fireworks
Championships, explodes in brilliant colours high over lake and city.
There is also a serious side to the festival, with an academic
conference and the Stockholm Water Prize, awarded by the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences for outstanding contributions to water conservation.
This year's award comes to Britain. WaterAid, based in London, will
receive US$150,000 from King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden for its work in
bringing water and sanitation to over three million of the world's
poorest people.
In the Faroe Islands, not unlike Shetland but halfway to Iceland, the
National Festival is the two-day Olavsoka in the capital Torshavn, in
honour of St Olav's Day on July 29, the Faroese National Day. The big
formal event is the official opening of the Logting (Parliament) by the
Prime Minister following a service in the Cathedral. But the rest of the
two days, which start on the 28th, Olavsoka Eve, are devoted to serious
celebration, with national costumes to the fore.
In Iceland, still further north, the 16th International Iceland Rally
promises to be the most dramatic, when the 800 horsepower engines of the
off-road vehicles scream along the edge of great crevices, fly through
the air, power up near-vertical hills and test their skill on black lava
ash.
Like most Nordic countries, Finland has a long tradition of summer
folk festivals. Many Finns also have remarkable music talents, from folk
to classical, allied to a stronger tradition of listening to music than
in any other Nordic country. All this has led to some of the best
festivals anywhere. Kaustinen Folk Music Festival attracts 92,000
guests; Kuhmo near the Russian border has chamber music; Ruissalo, near
Turku in the south-west, claims to have the world's oldest rock
festival. In all, 57 festivals belong to the Finland Festivals
organisation.
But it is the Opera Festival at Savonlinna that has a dramatic setting
nothing else can match, in the 500-year-old castle at Savonlinna,
circled by Lake Saimaa. This year's festival from July 8 to August 5
will stage the world premiere of Sallinen's new Finnish opera, The
Palace, the sixth Finnish opera premiere in the last few years. Macbeth
and The Flying Dutchman are also on the programme and, from St
Petersburg, the first visit of the Mariinsky Theatre, with a full
operatic production of Shostakovitch's tragic opera Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk, and Puccini's Tosca.

* AFTER the right royal celebrations in Leith, the Princess Royal will
fire the starting gun on July 18 and the whole Tall Ships flotilla of
three and four-masters, clippers, schooners, the world's largest sailing
ship, the Sedov, and the QE2, will then set sail to Germany and Denmark,
and on to Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The finish of this Cutty Sark
Tall Ships Race will be a special parade on August 10, with the ships
moored for four days in the old part of Amsterdam Harbour. There will
also be a mock battle, with much thundering of cannons.
* Netherlands Tourist Board, 0171 630 0451.
* MODERN technology is entering even more into the relationship
between airlines and their customers. Until July 23, British Midland is
offering its business customers a digital mobile phone, complete with a
line connection, absolutely free. The offer goes to passengers
travelling on British Midland's European three-day Executive and
Eurobudget fares, and domestic three-day and one-day Executive tickets.
There is a choice of Metro World and Business World call tariffs,
whichever is the most appropriate.
Meanwhile, United Airlines has run a successful test launch in America
of ticketless air travel for business passengers. You buy the flight
over the phone or through a travel agent and get an advance seat
reservation. At the airport, a special photo ID card, or the credit card
used to buy the seat, gets the passenger through the check-in, and the
airline claims a single phone call is usually all it needs to change an
itinerary or arrange refunds. United Airlines is now expanding
electronic ticketing throughout the United States and exploring ways to
extend it to the rest of the world.
* FAR AWAY from electronics, the Scottish Wildlife Trust returns today
from a very unusual week's seawatch, on the lookout for basking sharks
(Cetorhinus maximus) off the Mull of Kintyre and the south-west coast of
Scotland. The world's second-largest fish is a harmless plankton-eating
30ft beast but numbers seem to have dropped drastically off the Scottish
coast. But the basking shark is not yet protected and the trust is
preparing sightings for a review of protected species in October.
There are three further week-long trips in July, August, and
September, on the 42ft ocean-going yacht, Kylan, which also has an
engine. As a treat for eager wildlife watchers, the Scottish Wildlife
Trust has two double-berth cabins on offer for each week, in this
fully-equipped vessel, leaving and returning from Inverkip Marina in
Greenock. The cost is #160 per person.

St Nicholas Garden behind Provand's Lordship officially opens next
week. Leslie Duncan explains why Glaswegians will applaud
ONLY two years ago, Glasgow's oldest house had a water-tower, barbed
wire, and temporary office buildings for an incongruous setting. Now the
rehabilitation of the city's historic core continues with the official
opening by the Princess Royal next Friday of the St Nicholas Garden
behind Provand's Lordship.
The old medieval idea of a physic garden is particularly appropriate
for the 1471 building which in pre-Reformation times was the manse of
the St Nicholas Hospital. And of course, further down the High Street,
the original Glasgow University had its own physic garden in the
eighteenth century.
The brief of the architects -- winners of a competition run jointly by
Glasgow Development Agency and the city two years ago -- was to make a
garden evocative of the period of Provand's Lordship without resorting
to pastiche. The plants and building materials -- sandstone and granite
-- would be true to the period, though used in a more modern idiom. The
aim was to create an area of sanctuary in this busy part of town.
How well the concept has succeeded can now be judged. The old house
still sits on the pavement of Castle Street looking through dark window
panes at its giant mock-baronial neighbour, the museum of religion,
across the street. But the former thoroughfare of McLeod Street at its
side is now transformed to a promenade with paving stones rimmed in
granite and dappled by the shadows of young sycamore trees. On the
right, a set of tall black gates -- not of wrought iron but mild steel
-- protect a loggia which in turn leads to cloisters and the physic
garden proper.
Linger at the gates. Stylised detail from the Glasgow coat of arms
decorates them. The bird, with his wings in profile, perches on top.
Leaves from the tree sprout from the vertical stanchions. Gate handles
are wittily cast in the form of the fish. Bells are square (as was the
original St Mungo bell, points out Alan Stewart, head of urban design
for Glasgow city planning, who has been closely involved with the
project).
The gates are being embellished with decorative panels by their
designer, Jack Sloan. Subjects range from Mary Queen of Scot to Joan
Eardley. Two elongated clerics are already in place: St Nicholas, patron
saint of sailors and money-lenders, accompanied by a spray of coins and
a boat; Bishop Muirhead with a model of St Nicholas Hospital, which he
founded.
Pedestrians can approach the garden from Castle Street. Buses and cars
will disgorge their passengers at the other end of McLeod Street,
overlooked by the halls of residence of Strathclyde University. The
sloping site offers a panoramic view of the regenerating heart of old
Glasgow.
The tower of the Barony North church rears behind the red sandstone
walls of the university's Barony Hall. The Necropolis with its statues
on plinths fills the background, though John Knox is out of sight.
Provand's Lordship, its crowstepped gables and slated roof slightly
awry, doesn't quite block the view of the museum of religion. The sooty
tower of the cathedral, set-off by the greenery of the trees in its
concourse, gives way to the Royal Infirmary. Mackintosh's Martyrs'
School is there too, though hidden by a stray tenement.
Visitors may be less interested in vistas than immediate prospects.
They will surely approve of the herbaceous border, where delphiniums,
canterbury bells, and foxgloves are already blooming.
They may tell the time by the new sandstone sundial (''It's five
minutes fast,'' jokes the clerk of works), or consult the circular
view-finder. The varieties of old apple tree planted out in the orchard
are between blossom and fruit at the moment. They will look well in
spring.
Pedestrian and motorised visitors will meet in the loggia which leads
to the gently raked cloisters (enabling access for people in
wheelchairs). These stone cloisters echo the theme of medieval
tranquillity and invite people to stop and rest on the benches of solid
oak. Here they may admire the herb garden itself or view (and be viewed
by) the Tontine Heads.
These historic sculptures were once keystones in the Tontine building
in the Trongate. Some may be caricatures of city officials of the day.
Others look decidedly miffed at the outcome of their financial
speculations (the tontine, it may be remembered, was a somewhat macabre
form of investment in which the survivor took all). Gently lit by spot
lighting, they will glower even more impressively in the dark than on a
sunny afternoon.
Also incorporated in the wall are a seventeenth-century royal coat of
arms with the two unicorns of Scotland and a vigorously carved Glasgow
coat of arms from the Old College in the High Street. The cloisters'
roofing of ''terned'' steel, which will fade to look like lead (but
without the temptation to thieving), is the one incongruous note in this
harmonious concept. Surely traditional slates would have fitted in much
better with Provand's Lordship's own roof?
There can be no carping about the garden itself. Herbs which were the
traditional remedies for ailments connected with different areas of the
body -- stomach, head, lungs -- are planted out in beds marked with
carved decorative granite stones by Tim Pomeroy.
He is also responsible for the central feature, a granite font from
which water spills gently into the curved basin below. This water-lapped
sculpture will have its own therapeutic effect on viewers. One can only
hope that the vulgar habit of throwing coins into fountains for luck is
discouraged here. An embryo knot garden of box-hedging surrounds this
focal point which will also be sheltered by a yew hedge.
Old-fashioned roses will be trained up the cloister pillars and
trellises, adding their blooms and sweet scents to those of the camomile
lawn planted in the midst of granite paving.
The garden brings new grace to an area which until a few years ago
might have seemed to be in unrecoverable decline. Glaswegians and
visitors alike will applaud it. And a prediction -- Strathclyde
graduands will flock here to have their graduation-day pictures taken.
The project, costing about #500,000, has been funded principally by
Glasgow Development Agency with the help of European regional
development funding, Glasgow City Council, and Strathclyde Regional
Council.

THE tomb of Archbishop Makarios, the first President of Cyprus after
independence from British rule, is set high on the top of a mountain
known as the little throne in one of the most remote areas of the
island.
This peak of the ''Throni'', in the heart of the Troodos mountains,
surpasses 1500 metres and commands a magnificent view for miles in every
direction. It overlooks undulating seas of green Aleppo pines and cedar
to Mount Olympus, snow-capped from January to March, down to the fertile
valleys of Solea and Marathassa, and far away to the Mediterranean,
shimmering blue in the distance.
The tomb itself is in a grotto hollowed out of the hillside. The plain
stone sarcophagus is unadorned, except for a couple of vases of flowers
and a photograph of Makarios (who was the third of that name), wearing
the typical black head-dress of the Orthodox prelate. A permanent guard
of honour keeps watch over the monument. When I visited, this consisted
of two young soldiers hanging around, clearly bored, at the chapel
entrance, having a smoke and a chat. Not many visitors come here, and in
the great silence of the surrounding forest -- broken only by the wind
in the branches and the chirping of birds -- time must seem, indeed,
endless.
Mt Throni is out of the way for the Greek Cypriots of the coast, and
the cities of Larnaka, Limassol, Nicosia and Paphos. They come here when
they are making a pilgrimage or a trip to the Monastery of Kykko, the
monastery of the Acorn, which is only 3km away.
The Monastery of Kykko, which has recently been restored to its former
glory, is the richest and most famous monastery of the island. It is a
place of long echoing passageways and vaulted corridors, with walls and
ceilings completely covered in mosaics and frescoes in gold and glowing
pastel colours, of Christ and the Apostles, the Mother of God and John
the Baptist, Archangels, Patriarchs, Biblical scenes and mythical
creatures, like one long, progressive picture book. Black-robed monks
pass discreetly along wooden verandas round the central courtyard with
its medieval well and a little stand selling postcards and tourist
videos -- the only concession made to visitors. The whole effect is
charming, peaceful and otherworldly. However, the Byzantine chapel,
lavishly decorated in gold leaf, the precious icon of the Virgin Mary,
attributed to St Luke, encased in an enormous ornate silver tabernacle,
may prove a little overwhelming for more subdued Protestant tastes.
The true charm of Cyprus, I found, lies not on its beaches -- although
there is an undeniable thrill in rising from the same foam as the
goddess of love, Aphrodite, who emerged from the waves in the rocky cove
of Petra Tou Romiou on the south-east coast of the island -- but in the
mountainous interior. The roads up to the hills lead away from the
souvenir shops and English pubs, Chinese takeaways, pizza houses,
discotheques, clubs, Indian restaurants and touristy tavernas serving
dubious moussaka. The roads take you straight into another world, which
is unhurried, timeless and traditional, where women with black veils
over their heads lead donkeys down stony village streets, flowers sprout
out of pots improvised from discarded olive oil containers, men sit for
hours at pavement bars talking about the world and little Byzantine
churches stand with open doors at corners, ablaze with candles and
adorned with dangling votive silver eyes and strange wax dolls
representing the infant Jesus.
It took me two visits to Cyprus to see the Troodos highlands, which
are much further away than they seem on the map. There is only one
highway on the island -- the Nicosia-Larnaka-Limassol. All other roads
tend to be narrow, twisting, meandering and frequently unsurfaced.
Progress can therefore be much slower than you anticipated -- and it
is easy to be sidetracked. How to resist stopping off at the picturesque
little wine villages of the Krassochoria foothills, when you are coming
from Paphos, for instance? The cobbled main street of Omodhos, leading
down to the Holy Cross Monastery, is draped with lacework and linen for
sale like bunting and lined with stalls displaying wine, local liqueurs
and honey. Beware of lingering lunches under pergolas, in charming
country tavernas, with a nice bottle of Othello, or Fair Lady -- or, if
you are lucky, the famous Commandaria, the Wine of the Kings, much
appreciated by Richard the Lionheart, who married Berengaria of Navarre
in the chapel of Limassol Castle.
It took us more than an hour to negotiate the mountain road from
Prodhromos to Kakopetria. Prodhromos is the highest village in Cyprus
and Kakopetria, a favourite holiday resort for Cypriots, lies a mere
15km away. It is a hair-raising 15km of steeply climbing track, a
veritable obstacle race of fallen rocks and scree in the heart of the
lonely forest. Kakopetria (which can be reached much more easily by
other routes) was well worth the effort. It's a cheerful village with
several interesting old churches, clinging like lichen to the black
rocks of the mountainside we had so perilously descended. An age-old
ritual is still performed around one of these rocks, the Petrou tou
Androginou. After weddings, the bridal couple pass three times round
this sacred stone, with the priest throwing in his blessing for good
measure.
The Monastery of Ayios Nikolaos tis Stegis, or St Nicholas of the
Roof, at Kakopetria, is one of the nine Byzantine churches of the
Troodos accorded World Heritage status by UNESCO. The Old Town of
Kakopetria is also a Cypriot national treasure, with its narrow cobbled
street, overhung with wooden balconies, perched on a spur of rock above
a swift-flowing river. This is one of the places to buy hand-made lace
and crochet work, and to sip a refreshing ouzo on one of these wooden
verandas suspended in space.
From Kakopetria, it is 50km to the capital, Nicosia. This is one of
the most fascinating towns on the Mediterranean, with a 4000-year-old
history, and a double name. The Greeks, in fact, call it Lefkosia
(Lefkosha for the Turks). Here, incense-perfumed, candlelit Byzantine
churches stand next to Muslim mosques with half moons set atop their
minarets and the wailing chant of the muezzin alternates with the
ringing of chapel bells. A vast sweep of green parkland runs around the
outside of the old fortifications, built by the Venetians in the
sixteenth century, and now gracefully draped with climbing plants and
greenery.
The picturesque old town is encompassed within these 5km of city wall.
It was Sunday when I landed there and there was hardly a soul to be seen
in the narrow, shadowy streets. Few people live there nowadays. They
have all migrated to the modern high-rise apartment blocks outside the
walls.
Outside the imposing Archbishop's Palace stands a colossal statue of
Makarios III, garlands of flowers left daily at its base. Near there, we
strolled down Leifte Street, with its souvenir shops, cafes and jeans
boutiques.
It looks more or less like any other high street in any other European
town -- except that half-way down, it abruptly comes to a dead end.
A wall stretches right across the street, reaching up to the level of
the balconies on the first floors of the deserted buildings on either
side. Soldiers, under a Greek flag, patrol the platform built on top of
the wall. Behind the wall, we can see nothing but ruins. Nearby, a sign
in Greek and in English reads: ''The World's Last Divided City''.
Since the Berlin Wall came down, Nicosia holds the dubious honour of
being the only city where its citizens cannot pass freely from one part
to another. A line across the map of the island splits the turtle shape
of Cyprus into two equal parts.
In silence, we walked round the tiny museum set up in an empty house
on the right of the wall, looking at 20-year-old faded photos of the
crowded Famagusta beaches, now in the Turkish section, and the
archaeological and artistic treasures now in Turkish territory, such as
the medieval tower in which Orson Wells filmed Othello, the ancient city
of Salamis, Hilarion Castle, the Monastery of Apostolos Andreas and the
Theatre of Soli.
Much sadder still, the photographs of some of the 1619
''desparecidos'', who have vanished without trace, as a consequence of
the conflict -- and ever-open wound which lacerates the island.
You would never guess such animosity exists down on the beaches, where
the sun always shines and everybody is having such a good time.

IT is a glorious evening in late spring. We stand on the step of the
hotel and survey the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Arran. It is a
sight, as has been said, that should be on a shortbread tin. But all is
not well.
For a start, only two golfers can be seen on the links of Royal Troon,
and closer inspection of the nearby gorse bushes reveals discarded
Irn-Bru cans. Not as many cans, I hasten to add, as litter a public
course. But herein, I'd venture, lies part of the problem of tourism in
Scotland today.
Let's start with the cans. I have nothing but admiration for a company
that can produce a drink spanning generations, so that on the one hand
little children enjoy it, while I have also seen leather and chain-clad
gorillas swagger into bars and say: ''seez a voddie and Irn-Bru.''
The trouble is that Scottish golfers drink the stuff as they play,
then toss the cans into the bushes. My son and I, who are regular
visitors to Scottish golf courses, share the joke that should
geographical deprivation ever afflict us on a golf course we can quickly
tell we're in Scotland just by looking under a bush and finding the
inevitable Irn-Bru can.
But it's not a laughing matter. Scotland is filthy with litter. On my
last visit I saw children throw away sweetie wrappers in Ayr's High
Street, men toss cigarette packets on the ground in Dumfries, and a
young woman grind a cigarette on to the floor of Glasgow Airport.
Whole families do it, such as the awful foursome I once saw on a train
from Glasgow. They got on -- mother, father, and two children -- all
with tins of soft drinks and packets of crisps. The garbage was dropped
on the floor, one tin at a time, one scrunched-up packet after the
other. Nobody said anything. The parents just sat, vacant looks on their
faces, as if they resented the time away from the TV set.
The rest of the world, at least not the civilised bits, don't do that
any more. As a result visitors are appalled, I'm sure, when they see the
mess Scotland is in.
It all gets down to education: at home and in the schools. Vancouver
in Canada, where I live, has clean streets. In America, companies and
celebrities ''adopt'' stretches of highways and pay for litter and
graffiti removal. In Singapore, you could eat lunch off the floor of
Changi Airport.
Back to Royal Troon. Because the Open is played here occasionally
there are legions of golfers who want to have a go as well. This leads
us to the second problem which is golf. Scotland has a limited number of
famous courses which handle demand in different ways.
Royal Troon asks #85 for a day's play (actually two rounds, one of
them on Portland, plus lunch) and restricts visitors to three days a
week. The other side of the coin is that such green fees are four times
what golfers pay for good courses in Canada. As a result, not a lot of
Canadian golfers are inclined to line up for a game at Royal Troon, or
anywhere else in Scotland for that matter, because it is the big name
courses that draw the tourists, who will also play the underrated
secrets of Scotland, such as Belleisle at Ayr.
One private club that does a good job for Scotland is Royal Dornoch.
It has a ''country'' membership that takes in the rest of the world, it
costs less than #200 when I last looked, and I know, in Vancouver alone,
two Air Canada pilots who come over every year.
They stay in local digs, spend money that provides jobs, and over
pints of Belhaven wonder why other private clubs don't copy. Canada,
Australia, the US, et al have oodles of golfers smitten by nostalgia who
would gladly fork out #200 for a few games a year (even at off-peak
times) and the sense of belonging to a classic Scottish club such as
Carnoustie, Muirfield, or Prestwick . . . if it was promoted.
One would think the promotion of Scotland overseas would be easy, what
with the glorious scenery, romantic history, and safety of travel. The
Scottish Tourist Board, led by its able new chief executive Derek Reid,
is making the most of Rob Roy and the other ''kilt movies'' about to hit
world cinemas, but the competition is fierce from other countries.
One thing I gathered at the recent Scottish Travel Fair is that
Americans (a big market) are catching on to bed and breakfast, seeking
out places such as the Galashiels home of Aileen Platt, voted best B&amp;B
landlady in Britain. She charges just #16 a night, which is not only a
bargain -- but with B&amp;B they also get to meet the locals.
Compare this to the small hotel I stayed at in Ayr, where the charge
for B&amp;B was #57 and the only company, other than the poker-faced owner,
was a wealthy couple from England who asked me about other places to
dine out because this place was so expensive.
So here's another problem, one that affects most of Europe in fact,
that quality does not come cheaply. The STB should promote the Aileen
Platts of the nation in America, which has the world's friendliest
people after Scotland.
Contrary to what you might think, Americans are not big spenders, and
unlike the Japanese they don't like groups and would rather hire a car
and explore Scotland staying at B&amp;Bs. They are always interested in
tracing their roots, and here the STB should consider more ways to
appeal to the huge number of Americans whose origins lie in Scotland.
Rip-offs must be stopped and customer service addressed. This hotel in
Ayr charged me almost #5 to launder a shirt and #2 for two brief, local
calls. (A much nicer hotel in nearby Troon charges just #2.20 to do a
shirt.)
I once came across a restaurant in Edinburgh where customers who
ordered steak were billed extra for the sauce. People who can afford to
stay at good places hate being soaked for over-priced extras; it sends
them away with a sour taste.
Which brings me, sadly, to Paisley. This dismal dump is a sorry
send-off for any tourist to Scotland, yet many tourists returning home
via Glasgow Airport have to drive their rented cars through the
crumbling centre where the route is poorly signposted. I must have done
it 50 times and it's always a cliff-hanger of bewildering signs, often
obscured by traffic, lane changes and tortuous turns. Goodness knows how
teachers from Indiana do it.
Maybe the airport car rentals should be moved to the Glasgow city
centre, always a pleasure to visit, in which event tourists could
commute by bus (a bargain at #2) or Glasgow taxi -- and here I have to
say that Glasgow taxis are cheap and cheerful compared to the
over-priced London variety, and the bandits who drive them!
Finally, it's time to state the obvious: There's nowhere like
Scotland. Unfortunately, not all Scots are aware of this. For example,
instead of dashing off to Spain every summer, why don't they make use of
the winter months, when the weather at home is really bad, to go off and
see the world?
Scotland from spring to autumn can be magic, and summer evenings have
up to five hours of daylight after work: time to go for a sail, take
your children for a ramble, or a drive to the seaside to watch a sunset.
You might even find a week here or a weekend there to slip over to
Arran and walk in the hills, play golf amid the wildflowers up at
Durness, or find a little B&amp;B in the Highlands such as the place an
Australian friend came across.
The owner was an old woman, so when she asked him about breakfast, he
said not to bother, as he was starting out early.
''It's no trouble to make some porridge,'' she said. ''I have to make
it for the dog anyway.''

From PATRICK BROGAN Washington, Friday
TWO Navy pilots and their navigator removed all their clothes, their
helmets, and their oxygen masks and mooned at the pilots of another
plane.
Then they all passed out for lack of oxygen, the plane crashed, and
they were killed.
An Air Force transport plane was giving the crew's wives a ''spousal
orientation'' flight. The pilot's wife thought it would be fun to fly
the plane herself, and he let her take the controls. The plane crashed.
These are the two most extraordinary episodes revealed by an Air Force
safety officer who suddenly decided that he had had enough of covering
up for his superiors. Alan Diehl was chief civilian safety office for
the Air Force until he was abruptly transferred last October.
He then handed over a report he had compiled on about 30 crashes of
military planes whose causes he claimed had been covered up by the
services. The Washington Post obtained an extract from the report and
published it today.
The dates and the names of the people involved have not been revealed,
but no doubt we will soon learn them. Some cases of incompetence are too
blatant to be covered up, of course. A very senior officer crashed a
B-52 bomber last year, trying to force it to perform like a fighter.
There is a horrific video of the crash, the huge plane coming in low
over its base, but its wing pointing at the ground.
The inquiry in that case established that most air crews refused to
fly with the man because they thought him dangerous, but he was too
senior to be disciplined. The inquiry ordered a ritual slap on the wrist
to his superiors.
Yesterday the Army published the results of its inquiry into the
shooting down of one of its helicopters over North Korea, in which one
of the two-man crew was killed. It was obliged to admit that neither of
the men was qualified for the mission: they were not competent
navigators, and got lost.
Early this week, the Air Force exonerated the commander of a radar
plane which failed to inform two F-15 pilots in northern Iraq that two
helicopters they proposed to attack were American.
Everyone else involved had already been exonerated.
Among the other incidents mentioned in the Diehl report that were
covered up was one during the Gulf War. An inexperienced pilot crashed
his plane in a panic reaction when another Air Force plane made a
simulated attack on him. He had not been told of the exercise.
The base commander refused to allow the wreckage to be brought to
safety, and investigators had to look at it on the site of the crash
near the Iraqi front. They came under attack from Iraqi missiles.
In another case, two jets, ending a very long-range flight, nearly
crashed into a civilian airliner. That, too was hushed up.

<TEXT>
A FORMER prisoner with a love of the high life stole more than #33,000
from a charity which tried to rehabilitate him, a court heard yesterday.
Frank Eary, 40, stole #1000 a week from the Prison Charity Shops Trust
after being entrusted to look after their accounts. He forged cheques,
depriving good causes of cash raised by selling products made by
inmates.
Southwark Crown Court in London heard that Eary, of Romford, Essex,
had been jailed for five-and-a-half years in 1992 for stealing #411,000
from his previous employers.
Posing as an accountant, he forged company cheques and spent the money
on two Porsches, a swimming pool, a Rolex watch, and luxury holidays.
Two weeks before his release on parole last September, he was given a
job by a charity director and former prison governor.
Mr Timothy Cray, prosecuting, told the court that for about six months
no-one suspected anything was amiss. It was ''a real shock'' to the
charity to find out that thefts on this scale had occurred.
Eary, who admitted eight sample charges of theft, told police he had
spent some of the charity's money on a holiday in Scotland. Only #6000
has been recovered.
Jailing him for three years, Judge Robin Laurie said his crimes were a
''serious breach of trust''.
The judge said the charity, which made a habit of employing prisoners
in clerical jobs, had been ''unwise'' in extending a helping hand to
him.

A PRISON reformer last night called for changes to Scotland's judicial
system after a teenage girl hanged herself in Cornton Vale Prison,
Stirling.
Kelly Holland, 17, was found dead in her cell within the prison's
young offenders' institution early yesterday, less than 24 hours after
being sent there on remand.
On Thursday, she had appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court, where she
denied a number of charges, including assaulting a police constable,
resisting arrest, and breach of the peace, on Wednesday. She was
remanded by Sheriff Lewis Robb and was due to face trial next month.
Miss Holland, of Hillhouse Road, Hamilton, who is thought to have
served a number of previous custodial sentences, apparently left a note
in her cell, saying she could not face more time behind bars.
A fatal accident inquiry is to be held into her death. If it finds
that she took her own life, it will be only the second suicide within
the Cornton Vale complex since it opened in 1973. The other death was in
June 1986.
The jail and associated young offender's institution, which is
Scotland's only women's prison, currently holds 168 people. Its regime
is regarded as relatively relaxed.
However, Mr Drummond Hunter, director of the Howard League for penal
reform in Scotland, said the decision to remand a teenage girl to
custody was ''archaic''.
He added: ''Our system of justice is punitive, instead of restorative:
it's just overkill. We have got to be much more aware, as a community,
of our duties and responsibilities to each other, and find a much more
constructive solution to these problems.''
Miss Holland is the fifth person to have died so far this year in a
Scottish prison. Officials said there were normally about six deaths in
custody each year, although last year saw the unusually high total of
15.
Two separate studies are currently under way into suicide prevention
in Scotland's prisons. One is being led by a forensic psychiatry expert,
Professor John Gunn, from London University, the other by a team from
Stirling University.
A prison service spokesman yesterday declined to discuss the
circumstances of Miss Holland's death in advance of the official inquiry
but it is understood her cell was being checked every 15 minutes and she
was found dead by a prison officer.
New admissions to the jail are normally interviewed by a medical
officer but it was not clear yesterday whether she had been checked.
Police have investigated the death and prepared a report for the
procurator-fiscal at Stirling.
* Mr Gary McCambridge, 24, of Toryglen, Glasgow, was yesterday found
dead in the cells of Gorbals police station. Police said a post-mortem
examination would be carried out but there did not appear to be any
suspicious circumstances.
Meanwhile, a major change in the use of Scottish prisons announced
yesterday is aimed at utilising under-used accommodation to relieve
pressure on the chronically overcrowded system, writes JAMES FREEMAN.
The reshuffle means that the open Young Offenders' Institute at Castle
Huntly, between Dundee and Perth, will become an open prison for
low-risk adult male prisoners serving less than two years.
The displaced young offenders will go to Polmont but, towards the end
of the year, they will be rehoused at Cornton Vale, previously the
female-only prison outside Stirling where much accommodation was under
used. A new fence will segregate the sexes, effectively creating two
prisons from one.
Women prisoners serving short sentences can now also be housed locally
at Inverness, Aberdeen, and Dumfries -- all previously male-only jails
-- allowing them to serve sentences closer to their homes.

SCOTTISH Local Government Minister George Kynoch yesterday urged
leaders of the new unitary councils to pause before rushing into
appointing more officials.
Complaints have been made to the Local Government Staff Commission
over the way some appointments to top jobs in the new councils have been
handled and yesterday the public services union Unison urged its members
to speak out if they were dissatisfied.
The Minister met the 29 chief executives of the new local authorities
in Edinburgh to discuss the progress of reorganisation.
It is understood that the commission chairman, Mr Robert Peggie, who
also attended the meeting, told the chief officials they must try to
ensure that appointments to the new councils were not open to criticism.
Mr Kynoch said after the meeting that some of the problems which were
coming to light were because councils were rushing to get the people
they wanted.
''I have urged this morning that they don't necessarily dramatically
slow down but that they just pause and ensure that they are absolutely
adamant as to what they want to do and how they want to do it before
they go rushing to appoint people.''
However, Mr Kynoch said he believed that, in general, the
reorganisation was proceeding in an orderly fashion.
Unison yesterday sent a memo to all its local government branches
confirming that a number of situations had arisen during the process of
appointing officers which had given cause for concern.
It said that if any members of the union were dissatisfied with the
appointments process a complaint should be made to the chief executive
of the new authority, where possible before interviews got under way.
Mr Mark Irvine, the union's head of local government in Scotland, had
said that, if possible, he would raise any formal complaints with Cosla
or the commission.
Mr Kynoch also said he was disappointed that a number of senior Labour
councillors had refused to serve on the three new water authorities.

Jerusalem, Friday
A FRENCH cook was killed and nine other people injured today when
Muslim guerrillas fired rockets into an Israeli holiday resort.
The attack was part of a guerrilla campaign to damage Israel's key
tourism industry.
The injured included four French tourists, another from Spain, and
three Israelis, including an eight-year-old boy.
Dozens of tourists fled western Galilee, where the summer holiday
season is just beginning, after missiles landed in a Club-Med resort and
a nearby kibbutz.
In response Israeli air force planes bombed suspected Hizbollah
positions across the border in south Lebanon.
The guerrillas fired 13 Katyusha rockets in two salvoes around 6.15am
local time.
In Beirut, Hizbollah said the barrage was unleashed to avenge the
killing of a Lebanese woman in an Israeli bombardment yesterday. She was
the thirteenth civilian killed by Israeli shelling of south Lebanon
villages this year.
Israeli leaders accused Hizbollah of trying to sabotage Israeli-Syrian
peace talks which resume in Washington next week. They also demanded
that Syria, which effectively rules Lebanon, do more to rein in the
fundamentalists.
''We have to start our negotiations with Syria, and we would expect
the Syrians to take stronger steps and show greater involvement in
pacifying the area,'' said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
However Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin urged restraint on all sides and
the US later supported his call.
A spokesman said US Secretary of State Warren Christopher had
telephoned Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and the US ambassador
to Israel, Martin Indyk, called on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
to try to restore calm.
''Violence in southern Lebanon only serves those who wish to create
instability and undermines the search for Middle East peace. Groups such
as Hizbollah have exactly these aims in mind,'' said Nicholas Burns of
the US State Department.
Earlier this year Hizbollah leaders threatened to hit northern Israeli
holiday tourist areas to disrupt the lucrative tourist season.
An official with the Paris-based French tourism group Club
Mediterranee said after the attack that all guests and employes were
evacuated from the 500-bed resort, which had been fully booked.
Western Galilee regional council chief Yehuda Shavit called the
attacks devastating. ''All the vehicles have left. Now there isn't
anyone here,'' he told Israel Radio.
Five days ago Hizbollah killed three Israeli soldiers in an ambush in
south Lebanon, its bloodiest operation this year against Israeli
occupation troops.--Reuter/AP.

I KNOW a chap who boasts an aristocratic name, a modest chateau in
Normandy, and a good job. He has an infuriating tendency to extol the
virtues of Britain's Tories and lives in a spacious council flat in a
nice part of town.
Curiously, each of his numerous children enjoys a similar flat, in
theory reserved for employees of Paris City Council.
The indispensable French knack of piston, the ability to pull strings
accompanied by corresponding absence of shame, lies behind that housing
scam, a phenomenon I naively thought a limited one. It appears to be the
norm.
Paris City Hall rents cheaply around 300,000 apartments, as good or
better than anything available private. Putting such quality housing the
way of political friends with a minimum of delay and the maximum of
discretion, sometimes in exchange for a little cash gratuity, while
those with a real need but no influence can wait for years, is
widespread.
A wave of revelations about sharp practices is causing enormous damage
to the Gaullist-controlled city council; its new mayor, Jean Tiberi; and
by ricochet, the former mayor, President Jacques Chirac and his Prime
Minister Alain Juppe. Both the latter occupy spacious Paris apartments
at a fraction of normal rent and Mr Chirac must have been aware of all
the flagrant favouritism.
Mr Tiberi, who should be sworn in tomorrow as Mayor of Paris, one of
the country's most enviable political jobs after 18 years as Mr Chirac's
deputy, has had a trying week. Last Sunday, after reports of corrupt
management of the city's stable of apartments, six of Paris's 20
districts fell to socialist candidates. The National Front returned more
councillors than ever.
Mr Tiberi's rule over the city, which one paper nicknamed Chiractown,
looks suddenly fragile. In an evident access of fatigue, Mr Tiberi said
last week that he and a couple of top colleagues at city hall were being
slandered in the press because they were all Corsican.
In the mayor's case, however, it was his children, not his
Mediterranean origins which were causing trouble. In 1983 Dominique and
Helene Tiberi, aged 35 and 34, already occupying council property in
desirable areas of the left bank, were given large private flats by
their parents. Since then, it transpired last week, they have stayed
put, paying low council rent and renting out their private property.
Equally embarrassing has been a newspaper investigation which led to a
reporter obtaining a council apartment virtually overnight thanks to an
under-the-counter payment of #4000. The chap who received the tip has
been charged, but attempts to brush off the incident as a regrettable
rarity failed after a former city council employee came clean in
embarrasing detail about Paris's housing department.
He described how it had been turned into a sort of top-secret
political gift shop, pandering to allies and those of whom favours might
be required -- or their children. The unnamed employee said Mr Juppe had
acquired an extra top floor room without paying more rent and accused
former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of having obtained a flat for his
son Pierre, then trying to expel another tenant to acquire that
apartment for him, too. Mr Balladur denied the tale but the tenant
corroborated it.
The weekly paper Le Canard Enchaine last week published a list of
secret codes allegedly used by Paris council officials to designate the
political personalities behind each request for housing. Mr Juppe has
the figure four; Jacques Toubon, Minister of Justice and mayor of the
thirteenth arrondissement, the number 10. Former Prime Minister and
failed presidential candidate Edouard Balladur, who can no longer be
much use to anyone needing a roof over their heads, is 21.
So many leaks obviously mean that some sort of political reckoning is
afoot. The political target appears to be the RPR Gaullist party and its
intimate hold on the administration of Paris, which has evidently been
reinforced by a grace-and-favour method of government. By getting
himself elected to the newly-created post of Mayor of Paris in 1977, Mr
Chirac gave himself an empire which appears to be crumbling only a few
weeks after his departure.

ONE of the key figures in the future of the rail network in Scotland,
the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising, is open to persuasion on the
future of the West Highland sleeper service, a court heard yesterday.
Mr Roger Salmon has reached the provisional view that the Fort William
to London Euston sleeper does not provide value for money because of the
level of subsidy required for the number of passengers who use it.
However, his current consultation exercise on services in the Highland
region after privatisation is not just an empty gesture, Lord MacLean
was assured at the Court of Session.
Last month, the region won an interdict at the Court of Session
preventing the immediate axeing of the sleeper and British Rail has now
agreed to run the service at least until the end of the summer timetable
on September 22.
Yesterday, Highland was back in court with another bid to secure the
sleeper's long-term future. This time it is taking on Mr Salmon, who
under privatisation decides on the minimum level of train services in a
particular area. Only services that he decides to franchise will get a
subsidy and all rail services in the Highlands have to be subsidised
because they lose money.
Mr Salmon has issued a draft passenger service requirement (PSR)
setting out the proposed services in the Highland region. The Fort
William sleeper is not included. Consultation with interested bodies,
such as the region, is due to end on July 12.
Mr Andrew Hajducki QC, representing Highland region, argued yesterday
that the consultation process had been rendered meaningless by Mr
Salmon's failure to explain why he had included some loss-making
services in his ''timetable'' but not others such as the Fort William
sleeper.
Mr Salmon argues that he is proceeding in accordance with instructions
set out by the Transport Secretary and that a distinction must be drawn
between this, the first franchising exercise, and future arrangements.
Mr Robert Reed QC, counsel for Mr Salmon, told the judge that previous
consultations over other proposed franchises had resulted in changes
being made to service requirements, for example the provision of
additional trains.
Meanwhile, Friends of the West Highland Line London are urging members
of the public to write to the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for
Scotland to try to get the Fort William sleeper included in the draft
passenger service requirement for Scotland.
Campaigners have discovered that the office of passenger rail
franchising will not accept representations from individual members of
the public. They have to come through the RUCCS.
Mr Lawrence Kemp, chairman of the RUCCS, told The Herald yesterday:
''Already we have letters coming in from members of the public
supporting the Fort William sleeper. These all help because they are
copied and sent with our submission to Opraf, so we are happy to receive
such letters at 249 West George Street, Glasgow, G2 4QE.''
Labour's transport spokesman Mr Henry McLeish said last night that the
judgment would have implications for the UK rail network, let alone
Scotland's, because all draft PSRs include ''damaging cuts to
services''.
Mr McLeish welcomed Mr Salmon's assurance about being open to
persuasion on Fort William sleepers. He added that all issues
surrounding ''the fiasco of ill-conceived service cuts'' would be raised
at a cross-party MPs' meeting with Mr Salmon next week.

THE medical pioneer who developed the first polio vaccine and tried to
devise a treatment for Aids, Dr Jonas Salk, died yesterday of heart
failure in hospital at La Jolla, California, aged 80.
Dr Salk spent a lifetime stubbornly pursuing his ideas even when they
drew scepticism from other researchers. ''There have to be people who
are ahead of their time,'' he once said. ''And that is my fate.''
Working at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1950s, Dr Salk became a
hero to millions of Americans when he ignored scientific doubters and
used killed virus to develop the first polio vaccine. His injectable
vaccine was declared effective in 1955 and the polio toll plunged.
Dr Albert Sabin's live-virus vaccine -- swallowed on a sugar cube --
was approved in 1961. Many experts believe it is more effective and it
ultimately gained favour although Dr Salk's vaccine is still used.
Dr Salk moved to California and in 1963 established the Salk Institute
for Biological Studies in La Jolla, a San Diego suburb.
He conducted research on multiple sclerosis and cancer before retiring
from his own laboratory in 1984. He continued to maintain offices at the
institute and in 1986 co-founded Immune Response Corporation of
Carlsbad, California, to search for an Aids vaccine.
Dr Salk modelled his Aids vaccine after his polio vaccine, using
killed Aids virus. Early tests seemed to support the approach, although
years of research were expected before its effectiveness could be
established.

JOHN Major faces a numbers game to decide whether his bold gamble has
paid off.
His resignation as party leader has made it easier for his opponents
to force a first ballot. They need only a proposer and a seconder to
sign the nomination papers, instead of the usual 10% of the
parliamentary party -- around 33 MPs.
There are 327 Tory MPs eligible to vote in the contest. Sir Richard
Body, a Euro-rebel, is still whipless and not entitled to vote.
To win outright on any first round, a candidate must obtain an overall
majority and win 15% more votes than the other candidates.
So Mr Major must win half the votes -- some 164 if all MPs take part
in the ballot -- plus 15% more votes than any rivals.
His target figure depends on how many candidates there are, and how
many MPs abstain.
But Mr Major's allies know that merely winning outright is not enough.
He must score a commanding victory over any challengers, enabling him to
stamp his authority on his unruly troops.
Mr Major may expect up to around 30 hardline Euro-sceptics to vote
against him or abstain, and if the rebellion was limited to this figure,
he could count himself lucky that his gamble had paid off.
If his enemies' ranks swelled as high as 50, with other dissidents
joining forces with the Euro-sceptics to help wreak revenge, this would
be unnerving but not fatal.
But if the numbers rose to 75, Mr Major would be wounded and while he
might decide to stay in office, he would have failed to see off his
rivals convincingly and become a lame duck Premier.
Anything above 100 would leave Mr Major so seriously damaged it would
signal the end of his leadership.
A second ballot would take place on Tuesday, July 11, but different
rules would apply. In this round, the winner would need an overall
majority, but not the further 15% on top.
If none of these candidates won an overall majority, the two with the
highest number of votes would go forward to a third ballot on Thursday
July 13.

JOHN Major's courage in confronting his back-bench snipers has won him
respect far beyond the Conservative Party, but the process he has
started is very uncertain and could develop in unpredictable ways.
We do not yet know if anyone will stand but I assume it is very likely
someone will. I certainly hope so, because the objective of clearing the
air will not be achieved if there is no contest. But while we are
waiting to see the next moves there are three big issues we must look
at.
It appears at first sight that this is another argument about Europe.
It has been the so-called Euro-sceptics who have led the attacks on John
Major which have destabilised the Government.
But at this stage that is irrelevant, whatever anyone says. If the
Euro-sceptics want someone to take us out of the European Union they are
not going to get it whatever happens. There is no party that stands for
any move further from Europe than we are now. The vast majority of the
Conservative Party is in favour of our membership as it is now, and the
opposition parties are for much closer integration with Europe.
John Major is by far the best hope for the Euro-sceptics if they
genuinely wish their policies to be advanced. In a logical world they
would long ago have realised this, and put their full weight, whatever
that is, behind him.
What this contest will put on trial is something quite different. It
is the Conservative Party itself that is under test and in particular
the Parliamentary Party.
The issue is simply this. Is the Conservative Party in Parliament
coherent and responsible enough to be fit to sustain a Government. It
has always been superbly good at this through its long history but in
the last two years this reputation has been seriously in doubt.
If a party cannot hold together and make policy compromises to sustain
its leader, it is not worth having and not fit to be given
responsibility of government.
Failure to vote for John Major will indicate a chronic lack of
self-discipline and responsibility. Changing a leader at any time should
be a very unusual act, but to do so while that leader carries the
responsibility of leading our country should be so rare as to be almost
inconceivable.
I sometimes wonder if more than 16 years in government has dulled the
senses of Conservative back-benchers as to what a privilege it is to
provide the Prime Minister of the country, and also how extraordinarily
difficult it is to get him or her there.
To hear some of them talk you would think it was a foregone conclusion
that whoever the Tories choose will be acceptable as a Prime Minister to
everyone. And if they choose to change their leader every year or two,
the country will just have to accept it.
This arrogant attitude will not do, and it raises a big constitutional
issue. The principle is as follows. The people elect Members of
Parliament in a General Eletion. The leader of the largest party is
appointed Prime Minister and puts his programme on which he was elected
to the House of Commons.
Assuming he is supported in this he is confirmed in Government and his
party supports him through his term of office. The question is, is it
acceptable for the party in power to change the leader under whom the
country voted for it?
On the face of it, it must seem doubtful, but it has been done
frequently throughout history by all parties. A leader can die in
office, or he can just get fed up with the job as did Harold Wilson. In
those circumstances, the government party has to provide an alternative
leader, and nobody expects otherwise.
There is a different feeling, however, when a party in government
appeals to want to change its leader voluntarily for tactical advantage
as happened in the case of Mrs Thatcher, and would happen now if a
change were made. I do not think there is a way of preventing this.
The key to the Prime Ministership is whether he or she can carry the
House of Commons with him or not. This is the acid test and the elected
representatives of the people are the right people to judge this. They,
after all, can be thrown out if they get it wrong.
But even if it cannot be prevented, that does not mean it is
acceptable or right. I think it is most unwise to change a leader while
the leader is in the highest office in the land, and is a world
statesman as well.
It diminishes Britain and it treats the electorate of Britain with
contempt.
In this contest therefore I believe it is not John Major, but the
Conservative Party in Parliament that is on trial. Are they mature and
responsible enough to sustain a Prime Minister and a Government through
its term of office or are they not.
If not, they deserve no more confidence from us, but I believe the
next two weeks will show a big, real level of support for John Major,
and this will strengthen him through to the end of his Parliament.
He has shown the sort of courage which we need in a leader of this
country, whatever his Party.

IF the Foreign Office has anything to do with it, the man who will
move there in the reshuffle will be Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
He was one of its Ministers from 1982 until 1986, first as an Under
Secretary then Minister of State, and was highly regarded by his
officials. He is said to want the job and, after a good three years at
defence, is due for a move.
It has to be promotion because, both at defence and in his previous
Cabinet jobs as Scottish Secretary and Transport Secretary, his record
is sound. Mr Rifkind, a Major loyalist, is not for sacking nor demoting.
The drawback to the appointment invariably cited, although possibly
not important now that the Israelis are talking to the Palestinians and
the Middle East process is not stagnant, is that he is Jewish.
He certainly has the intellectual ability and the experience to do the
job and to keep the mandarins on their toes. He is also no pushover for
civil servants, a quality essential in any Foreign Secretary where the
officials try to dazzle the boss with science more ruthlessly than in
any other department.
The job is certainly a glittering prize and the Tory right will want
someone hostile to Europe to get it, rather than Mr Rifkind, even if he
has recently been making slightly grumpy noises on that subject.
The darling of the right, Mr Michael Portillo, is said to be their
favoured nominee. It is the sort of job which would boost his chances to
succeed as party leader.
However, the whole point of the leadership contest, apart from freeing
Mr Major from the ties with which the right are trying to bind him, is
to give him a free hand in the reshuffle and not have to make
appointments to placate the warring factions within the party.
If the contest does not give fresh strength to his arm, it will have
been pointless. That being so, Mr Portillo could well wish for the job
in vain.
If Mr Rifkind does not get it, then Mr Ian Lang could. He is a close
friend of the Prime Minister and has soldiered nobly in Scotland in what
must at times, although he manages to disguise the fact, feel like a
lost cause. He deserves to escape to more amenable pastures.
The problem about either man is that they are perceived as soft on
Europe. Mr Lang's departure would, however, leave the way open for Mr
Major to make a right-wing appointment by giving the job to Mr Michael
Forsyth.
The forces of reaction would have a new friend in the Cabinet and
since, as things can hardly get worse for Scottish Tories, his
appointment, which in some circumstance could do harm, might even do
some good.
The name of Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, also
crops up as a possible Foreign Secretary, but he is, along with the
Prime Minister, one of the chief players in the peace process and it
seems rash to move him just yet.

CONSERVATIVE Party chairman Jeremy Hanley yesterday told Tory
supporters to show some unity by taking a leaf out of the Labour Party's
book.
He spoke in glowing terms of the unity and discipline of the
Opposition during a trip to meet prospective parliamentary candidates in
Inverness, Moray and Gordon.
His comments are likely to be sezied on by Labour as yet another
blunder.
Mr Hanley said: ''The Labour Party is just as split, but it shows a
greater discipline at this moment because even the Dennis Skinners, John
Prescotts, Margaret Becketts, Robin Cooks of this world are saying: we
will let Tony Blair be the leader. We won't change our policies
necessarily; let him say whatever it is that gets us elected.
''Now that is an element of discipline within the party, discipline
which certain people in our party have not shown.''
Mr Hanley added that on Thursday it had been hard to find a Labour MP
who agreed with Mr Blair's stand on grant-maintained schools. He said:
''It was a staggering turnaround but you didn't get many people, apart
from Roy Hattersely, going out on College Green and slagging Mr Blair
off because there is a discipline there.
''It is a hunger for government. Our party, has to share that hunger
to retain government, otherwise we will undo all the good that has been
done over the past 15 years. What I am saying to those who have chosen
to argue in public, to parade on one particular strand of policy such as
Europe, that what they are doing is risking the Labour Party taking over
the government.''
''That would bring in a Europe that is so totally against the
interests of the British people. A Europe that would get rid of the
veto; extend qualified majority voting; would bring us into the social
chapter and the minimum wage; and would lead us to a federal Europe.
''If that's what the Euro-sceptics achieve, I ask them to decide
whether they are serving not only their party but their nation.''
Mr Hanley also reminded them that the Prime Minister was a deal more
popular with the voters than the party was as a whole. ''They should
remember that when they are considering their futures.''
He said the resignation announcement from Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd will help end years of destabilising speculation over the future
party leadership.
He rejected the notion that it gave the impression of a disintegrating
Government, believing it to fit in well with the Prime Minister's own
courageous move to resign and stand for re-election.
He described this week as a ''cathartic moment'' which would bring to
an end all the damaging orgy of speculation. He was totally confident
that John Major would win a resounding victory in the election.
He said: ''I have been talking to ordinary members and every man and
woman is saying: for goodness sake unite behind the Prime Minister and
stop all this bickering.''

LET us pause for a moment to consider Norma and her snaps. It is not
too fanciful to claim that Thursday's declaration marked a certain
turning-point in the Major marriage for, whatever the result on July 4,
life will never be exactly as before.
So, when the Prime Minister's wife joined the phalanx of cameramen in
the summer garden of No. 10 was she simply being playful, or did she
feel impelled to display her own proximity to history-in-the making?
Much of politics is about the difficult, self-centred nature of power,
that hunger to be at the hub of things. The wives of politicians know
this, and the shrewdest among them also understand that they will always
rank second when power's cold set of priorities swing into play. But to
make that awareness tolerable the acceptance acquires a special ambition
of its own.
In fact, the possession of power, by association, is just as addictive
as the real thing, for being close to the momentum of crucial events, --
either as a Cabinet Minister's wife or his paramour, or as a House of
Commons cleaner for that matter -- is a sort of drama in itself.
Such individuals are the extras in the theatre of government. They do
not necessarily seek to sway great events. They may not ever wish to
spill the beans, but in time -- if they survive the ruthlessness of the
party's hierarchical demands -- they become intoxicated by the chance to
watch the full panoply of power from the wings. And when that chance is
threatened these passive players have their own methods of attack.
So, we learn that Norma Major was the catalyst in her husband's
decision to call a Conservative leadership election. ''Take them on,''
she urged privately when he returned from last weekend's G7 Canadian
summit. ''Don't let them get away with it.''
In public, that quietly winning smile never faltered, but then this
woman, once considered dowdy, has bloomed in official life to become a
figure of animated warmth and style, and not for the first time we note
that as her husband's fortune grows more precarious, her social
confidence increases. It may be, though, that Norma Major's covert
dislike of the Witch of the West smoulders at the heart of her
encouragement to fight.
In plugging her book, Lady Thatcher plugged John Major full of holes,
but today with that deed accomplished her tone softens and the manic
reprimand: ''You've not been conservative enough'' changes to silky
dubiety.
By calling this election, says the Baroness, the Prime Minister
''shows he cares''. No partner, emotionally bound, easily forgives such
undermining but Norma has her own particlar score to settle. Last year
Lady Thatcher humiliated her by insisting she had no right to wear a
distinguished diamond necklace at one of London's influential
gatherings, the Lord Mayor's banquet.
The gems, said Lady Thatcher, were given to her by a visiting
dignitary during her premiership. In her anger she had overlooked the
fact that custom dictates such gifts be donated to the state, and are
made available to the Prime Minister and his spouse for official
functions.
Today life in that shrunken fishbowl for both politicians and their
families is more excruciating than ever because it leads to the exposure
of anything which might be remotely embarrassing.
Thus, we know that Elspeth Howe was hugely miffed at the loss of
Chevening, the official residence in Kent, of the Foreign Secretary, her
sense of hurt firing up Sir Geoffrey's own at the withdrawal of a job he
loved in a Thatcher reshuffle.
More than that, there is word that Elspeth, a formidable speech-maker
and independent public figure, master-minded her husband's Commons
finale which, in effect, became his most passionate Westminster
performance, a damning indictment of the policies meted out to the
nation by the woman Prime Minister he had for so long uncomfortably
served.
And now, as the will he? won't he? chant rings in Norman Lamont's
ears, there is also the conspicuous whisper that his bitterness towards
John Major goes beyond the political.
Rosemary, his wife, is said to suspect that the traumas preceding his
removal from office so badly affected their son's academic performance,
he failed to win a place at Oxford. Equally there are those who insist
that the Lamonts' marriage has long been fragile -- some years ago he
gained an infamous black eye during a punch-up concerning a lady. But
should the door of No 10 open wide for Norman, then Rosemary would
certainly want to share that address.
Of course, we still live in a country where politics is very much a
male club. Wives may type the letters, lick the stamps, distribute
pamphlets and get the vote out, but nearly always it is men who get
elected.
How understandable then that when power does beckon, those buttressing
women should want some public recognition. Even so, given the reckless
quality of politicians' lives, their hours, their temptations, the often
squalid deals which interline the fabric of power, it may seem
remarkable that anyone might want them as marriage partners in the first
place.

The modern leadership battle can be traced to the power struggles of
the 1960s. Stuart Trotter examines the history of winners, losers, and
stalking horses.
WHEN Sir Alex Douglas-Home succeeded Harold Macmillan as Tory leader
in 1963, the Conservatives were driven to establish a more democratic
method of finding a new leader.
The rowdy scenes at the Tory Party conference which heard Macmillan's
resignation statement also shocked some of the party.
Iain Macleod and Enoch Powell, the two most brilliant members of
Macmillan's cabinet, refused to serve under Sir Alex and Macleod wrote a
biting article about the ''magic circle'' of the Tory establishment
which had engineered the result against R A Butler, the choice of most
of the Cabinet, including Macleod.
When Sir Alex decided to step down after losing in 1964 to Harold
Wilson the electoral machinery was in place. As seems to have become the
rule in this election, one candidate organised extremely well and one
poorly. Ted Heath's campaign was efficiently masterminded by Peter
Walker and he had some abrasive performances in the Commons to his
credit.
Reginald Maudling was less well served by Lord Lambton and his
''dashful growth'' strategy when Chancellor had been heavily criticised.
Enoch Powell became the first of the ''no hope'' candidates who have
been another feature of the process. He still won comparitively narrowly
with 150 votes to Maudling's 133 and Powell's 15, but the losers stood
down.
Heath's nemesis came in 1975 after he had lost three elections and won
only one. By interesting comparison with today, Cabinet members did not
consider themselves debarred from opposing the leader. Sir Keith Joseph
considered doing so but eventually it was Margaret Thatcher.
Heath seemed to have little idea that most of his MPs saw him as a
loser who would have to go. He was poorly served by his campaign
managers, Mrs Thatcher brilliantly by Airey Neave.
Despite some hesitation in the overwhelmingly masculine parliamentary
party, Mrs Thatcher turned out to be much more than a stalking horse.
She beat Heath 130-119 with another quixotic candidate, Hugh Fraser,
MP for Stafford and Stone, getting 16 votes. No fewer than four members
of the Cabinet entered the lists for the second ballot when Heath
resigned.
Some thought the mainstream MPs would turn to Heath's loyal deputy,
William Whitelaw, but instead they decided that Mrs Thatcher deserved
the reward of her courage. She won an overall majority with 146 out of
271 votes. Whitelaw had 76, Sir Geoffrey Howe and James Prior 19 each,
and John Peyton 11. The first incumbent Tory Leader had been challenged
and beaten.
The next challenge, this time to Mrs Thatcher, appeared derisory. By
1989 she was recording only 25% approval in opinion polls, the Tories
had been hammered in the European elections, coming third behind the SNP
in Scotland, and Tory MPs where chaffing at her autocratic style.
Sir Anthony Mayer, a Welsh MP, former diplomat and keen
Euro-federalist challenged her, an obvious stalking horse.
She appeared to win easily with 314 votes but to Sir Anthony's 33 most
observers added 24 spoilt papers and three abstentions, including
Michael Heseltine. These 60 MPs registered considerable dissatisfaction
and set what the coming election could confirm as a key trend. For a
leader defending his or her position, abstentions are counted against
you.
The Tory party had fired a warning shot at Mrs Thatcher but she
appeared to take no notice. Fearing that the poll tax, very much her
baby, and her general unpopularity would drag them down to defeat at the
next election, the party was ready again to question her continuance in
power.
Sir Geoffrey Howe's memorable resignation speech forced Michael
Heseltine to challenge her.
Once again, a leader's campaign was woefully inadequate. Mrs Thatcher
won the first ballot by 204 to Heseltine's 152, but failed to reach the
208 necessary to avoid a second ballot. There is little doubt that with
a better campaign she could have obtained the additional four votes but
such a narrow victory would still have left her fatally wounded --
something that will apply to Mr Major as well. The Prime Minister needs
to do more than win. He must win well.
The Cabinet convinced Mrs Thatcher she would be humiliated in a second
ballot and she ducked the contest probably for the first time in her
political life.
There was then the friendliest election for the leadership to date.
Michael Heseltine found that he had indeed been only the stalking horse
he feared to become but could not avoid. Major collected 185 votes to
his 131 and Douglas Hurd's 56.
In this comparatively short-lived process this is the only precedent
so far. Two Prime Ministers who have been voted into the leadership have
also been voted out. No Tory leader of the three since 1963 has stood
down voluntarily.

AT FIRST glance, the omens were all wrong. The unlucky number 13 on
the navy blue door and the pot of marguerites on the doorstep did not
signal a message of confidence to the faithful.
Could John Major be displaying some glorious disregard of
superstition, or was his choice of campaign headquarters a further
example of the bad luck that has dogged his premiership?
No 13 Cowley Street, Westminster, is but a stone's throw from the
House of Commons, but it is just around the corner from the one-time
home of Lawrence of Arabia.
''Are the political sands of time running out on John Major?'' they
were asking yesterday.
Any such defeatist notions were being dismissed by the Prime
Minister's campaign team as they set up home. It is from this war bunker
that he has given charge to three musketeers, led by Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang.
Nevertheless, it could not have been far from the Prime Minister's
mind that Margaret Thatcher was deposed after a back-bench revolt.
Were the marguerites on the doorstep of John Major's command centre
just an oversight? Could they be intended as a demonstration of
defiance?
Those who went in and out and answered the door of No 13 could easily
have come from the shires. They and the long-haired gals popping in and
out were not saying, as Major's aides attempted to get their act
together.
Eventually they came out and said, despite the number on the door,
that the Prime Minister was prepared for battle and fate would not come
into it.
As he spoke, some extraordinary scenes were being recorded around the
Prime Minister's command and control centre. A teacher from Westminister
School had brought along half a dozen pupils to see democracy in action.
They saw Sir Robin Day put up two fingers when I asked him if he had any
comment to make about the Prime Minister's current situation.
Schoolmaster Mr Richard Pyatt said: ''We are only impartial observers.
Thus far I am not impressed.''
Most of all yesterday, in this quiet Westminster backwater, people
were going about their day-to-day business. BT employees were in the
street. They said they were only dealing with communication problems for
the road as a whole. However, officials from the Conservative Party
admitted they were placing new phone lines into John Major's
headquarters.
Apart from telephones there were also new fax machines and computers.
''The amazing thing is that, even before we have got off the ground, MPs
and constituency leaders have found out the numbers and they are
pledging full support,'' said one aide.
A woman in a Honda Civic pulled up outside John Major's new HQ. The
hatchback was full to overflowing with food, all carried in supermarket
plastic carrier bags. There were enough supplies to withstand a siege.
Over the road at the Liberal Democrat headquarters a wine merchant's
van pulled up with a much more interesting consignment. The Lib-Dems
were moving out to new premises, somewhere in Mayfair. They said they
were not leaving because the area was rapidly going downhill as a result
of the shenanigans across the road.
Tory grandees came and went. ''We are having a meeting,'' said one,
showing a degree of political astuteness. ''I am only the office boy,''
said Mr Robert Hughes, MP for Harrow West.
By this time it was getting hot in the net-curtained ground floor of
the #1.5m Georgian house, owned by former Tory MP Sir Neil Thorne and
sequestrated by the Prime Minister.
A pin-striped arm appeared and opened a window, either to let in fresh
air or let out hot air. A young girl was despatched to procure a fan.
No 13 was rapidly becoming a hive of activity, but even at this stage
there was still no sign of any opposition to John Major.
''When it does surface, we will be well prepared to deal with it,'' an
aide said. ''We are ready for it whenever it comes.
''The Prime Minister has gathered the same team that won him the
General Election,'' he said. ''He is going to win this battle too.''

A safe pair of hands is a precious gift in a politician. Douglas Hurd
was one of that rare breed, writes WILLIAM RUSSELL
IT is not surprising, in the light of the Prime Minister's decision to
force a leadership election, that Douglas Hurd should choose yesterday
to announce his decision to stand down as Foreign Secretary at next
month's reshuffle.
He has been signalling for over a year that it was his intention to
quit when the time was right, saying yesterday that he had told Mr Major
of his wish in the spring of 1994, and had reaffirmed his intention in
February.
The problem has been that the signals tended to get confused.
Sometimes he was going, sometimes he was staying. Since he was defeated
by Mr Major in the leadership contest, following the fall of Margaret
Thatcher, he has been one of the Prime Minister's most loyal supporters
and one of the few successful Ministers in the Government.
He has safe hands, that rarest and most precious possession any
politician can have. The Eurosceptics may detest him and all his works,
but the deals done over Europe at Maastricht, and in endless meetings of
the Foreign Ministers' Council in Brussels, owe a great deal to him.
But Europe has also provided him with some of his biggest headaches
and earlier this year officials were making clear that he felt it was
time to pay attention to the rest of the world. Europe and the
associated squabbles had just taken up too much time which could have
been better used on other more productive things.
While his part in tackling the Yugoslav crisis may not rank among his
finest hours, it has provided nobody with a finest hour and he is
certainly highly regarded by his peers around the world.
Those contradictory signals about his plans tended to come when a Hurd
departure could have been seen as desertion, causing the Prime Minister
unwanted problems when it came to a replacement. Hurd in place and the
distinctly unseaworthy Major ship, which is why things have come to the
present pass, could sail on a little longer.
In January, when the signals that he would go this summer were loud
and clear, I went on a trip with him to Bangladesh. The week before I
had written about the trip and set out the reasons why he was likely to
retire this summer.
The sources were sound enough, although the one source I did not have
was the ever discreet Mr Hurd himself. I told the Head of News that the
feature, which was partly based on a briefing he had given about the
reasons for the trip, had appeared earlier than I had expected -- the
New Year holiday meant that it had not been noticed at the Foreign
Office -- and the outcome was that it was sent for.
After a day out at aid projects up country, I boarded our helicopter
to find the Foreign Secretary sitting in the front row reading a fax of
the article. ''Just looking at your words of wisdom,'' he said. For the
rest of the trip the article made its way back down from adviser to
adviser. The thing is he did not say it was wrong, which he could easily
have done, although not in so many words -- that is not his style. In
the event it was not incorrect, although, come Easter, the signals that
he was staying on had resumed. They were, however, misleading.
He had been pondering all last month about the right timing for the
announcement of his departure. Had things not taken the unexpected turn
they have, he could have left it until the July reshuffle.
He decided, however, in the light of Mr Major's decision that it was
best to disentangle the issue of his own future from all the events to
come and was said to be relieved at having got it off his chest at last.
He has no firm plans for the future beyond the promise given in his
statement to be an active back bencher and support Mr Major in every way
he can from outside government, although he is known to want to return
to writing books.
So where does he stand in the ranks of post war Foreign Secretaries
now that his six year tenure of the job is about to end? Ask his
officials who they consider to have been the best man and they
invariably reply -- Ernest Bevin. He was there a long time ago, but
Foreign Office memories are long, and Bevin seems to have had everything
they respected -- an enquiring mind, high intellect and broad vision.
After that they tend to hesitate when it comes to second place, the
choice usually being between Geoffrey Howe, respected for the sheer hard
work he put in and his ability to master a brief, and Mr Hurd. The Hurd
qualities they admire are his ability to think a problem through, to
think ahead, and his amazing talent for thinking on his feet.
A Howe statement on an overseas trip would have been the result of
much oil being burned in the wee small hours by his Head of News, whose
task it is to put his master's words -- and the department's words --
into language the world can understand.
A Hurd pronouncement is invariably done without notes. He will have
had extensive briefing, but clear, and concise sentences flow without
the aid of a crib, all the more noticeable when it comes to answering
questions. It is a very considerable talent not all politicians possess.
If his officials have anything against him it is that he is too much
one of their own, too constrained by his departmental past -- he spent
14 years in the diplomatic service before entering politics -- to
challenge some of the perceived views of the Foreign Office.
It was this fresh eye, the unbiased look, the ability not just to ask
why, but to ask -- why not this or that instead? -- which Bevin brought
to the post. Hurd's past means that sometimes he will accept this is how
it has been done and is therefore the right way to proceed.
He is also admired for his unflappability. He has had some bad
moments. There was the visit to Egypt and Israel, where he was to meet
representatives of the PLO, which started well in Cairo and all the
signals were that the meeting in Jerusalem was going to go well. But
once there it went disastrously wrong.
Israeli politicians, playing their own game, leaked distinctly
inaccurate versions of the talks he had been having with them, which
were duly broadcast on Israeli radio and television while he, and pretty
well everyone else from the British embassy, were attending an official
dinner. By the time the British found out what was being put about it
was too late.
The PLO had gone into a monumental huff, and when Hurd turned up for
the planned meeting in the outskirts of Jerusalem it was to discover
they were not coming. The visit had collapsed in ruins. He managed to be
philosophical about it, which took some doing.
He is not a memorable orator, but he is a good public speaker and a
most efficient parliamentary performer. His biggest drawback is a
certain reserve, a tendency to seem aloof and that peculiar upper class
disregard for dress -- his green loden coat became not so much a symbol
of authority, as did Anthony Eden's hat, as a running gag on a par with
Michael Foot's duffle jacket or John Cole's houndstooth horror.
Maybe it is just the natural superiority of the Old Etonian, maybe it
is the tendency of the natural born diplomat, which he is, to be rather
grand and above the mundane. One of the less happy aspects of the
leadership election campaign was the attempt his supporters made to
present the upper class, but not aristocratic, Hurd, a man who does not
suffer fools gladly, as another of the party's Common Men.
A former President of the Cambridge Union, he joined the Foreign
Service in 1952, serving in Peking, Rome, in the British mission to the
United Nations and as private secretary to the Permanant Under
Secretary.
In 1966 he joined the Conservastive Research Department as head of its
Foreign Affairs section, and two years later became Edward Heath's
private secretary. When Mr Heath became Prime Minister he moved with him
as his political secretary. He entered Parliament in 1974 and has
represented first Mid Oxon and then Whitney.
He has risen, if not effortlessly, certainly smoothly from being
Opposition spokesman on Europe through Foreign Office Minister of State,
Home Office Minister of State, Northern Ireland Secretary, and Home
Secretary to his present job.
Married twice, he has three sons by his first marriage, a son and
daughter by his second. He is the author of a number of political
thrillers, including the notorious nationalist Scotch on the Rocks, the
television version of which had to be withdrawn, and likes to write
short stories using his experience gained on his longer overseas trips.
By deciding to go he has opened up the Prime Minister's options in the
reshuffle because it means one of the plum offices of state will be
vacant without requiring a sacking, and if one domino is moved it leads
to many more toppling.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher last night described Mr Hurd
as a giant of the Atlantic alliance who made his mark as a man of
''stature, civility and wit''.
Mr Christopher said he telephoned Mr Hurd and ''conveyed the
appreciation of the United States for his wise counsel and resolute
support over the past six years''.
He added: ''He has made a major contribution to strengthening the
ability of the Atlantic alliance to meet the challenges that have arisen
following the end of the Cold War.''
Murray Ritchie, European Editor, writes: Douglas Hurd presided over
another crisis in Britain's dealings with Europe when the Prime Minister
decided to veto the appointment of Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier
and master-fixer, to the presidency of the European Commission in
succession to Jacques Delors.
Hurd greatly admired Delors, as did all thinking British Cabinet
Ministers, although he disagreed, naturally, with the Frenchman's style.
John Major, seeking credibility at home, decided to block Dehaene's
nomination -- he was the choice of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a
fellow Christian Democrat -- but Hurd knew the damage that killing off
Dehaene would do to relations with pro-British Belgium.
While Major took the credit for being tough -- at least from Tory
Euro-sceptics -- Hurd was left to justify what appeared to be a crass
political gimmick. Major said simply that Dehaene was a force for big
government -- a fairly meaningless phrase -- and that Jacques Santer of
Luxembourg was the ''right man in the right place at the right time.''
Hurd was left to put some intellectual force into this blatant British
bluster. He argued, plausibly, that it was unnecessary at a time of
difficult transition for the European Union to have another
''philosopher king'' in the top job in Brussels. Few outside the UK were
convinced, but Hurd's patient, patrician style helped calm bad feelings.
Yet Hurd will be remembered as the Foreign Secretary who was left
justifying a brutal and sorely-felt insult to Belgium at a time when
plans were being made to celebrate D-Day -- a celebration which the same
Belgians later joined in wholeheartedly after booing British Ministers
arriving for council meetings in Brussels.
So Hurd will go down in the history books as a damage limitation
expert in Europe, never the visionary he might have been if times had
been normal. There is no doubt he had the intellectual clout to do the
job well. His trouble was he was handed the job at exactly the wrong
time in the EU's troubled evolution.
Nothing has done more damage to EU foreign policy than the prolonged
agony of Yugoslavia's disintegration into war. Yet the alternative was
to permit what Hurd called, memorably, the ''level killing field.''
Yugoslavia might yet come to that.
There is an irony in the fact that in the long term the seemingly
greatest failure of EU foreign policy -- ex-Yugoslavia -- might yet show
that Hurd was wiser than most of his colleagues. He will have to wait,
however, for the credit if it ever comes.

''BOOKS are one of the great pleasures of life and are vital in
providing your child with the words to express feelings, ideas, and
thoughts. They explain the world he or she lives in -- describing
relationships, depicting situations, and introducing personalities.
Books provide the impetus for imaginative play, they introduce ideas,
and they are fun.''
Dr Miriam Stoppard.
TO BEGIN at the beginning. Once upon a time babies were meant to be
seen (reclining happily in their coachbuilt prams wearing the
whisper-blue matinee jacket sent by Auntie Isa) and preferably not heard
at all for a year, at least.
Now babies practically emerge from the womb in workmanlike boilersuits
and natty matching caps. The idea is that they're up and at it from day
one. Nowhere is this revolution better reflected than the children's
book market. Thirty years ago baby books went no further than a handful
of board (or was it bored?) books depicting the same over-worked handful
of toys, farm animals, and household objects.
Today there is barely a bigger growth area in the jungle of global
publishing. If you think I'm exaggerating the change, take a look at the
Ladybird ''First Focus'' series. This includes books specifically aimed
at the nought-to-six-months age group. Because new babies see contrasts,
not colours, they are all in starkly symmetrical black and white -- op
art for new-borns. ''Stimulates visual senses. Helps babies learn to
focus,'' screams the blurb. What next? In utero, interactive CD Roms?
Don't laugh. This is just the way things are going. Sooner or later
someone's going to decide that the unborn simply have too much time on
their tiny hands.
With such a crazy explosion in publishing for tinies, bookshops and
libraries are having to be increasingly selective in what they take. How
do they decide? Is there such a thing as a good or bad book for a baby?
First I asked five mums and their toddlers to choose a favourite book
and talk about it. Then I put this question to Lynne James, mother of
three and village librarian who runs a popular storytime for toddlers in
Strathblane, and Barry Fogarty, manager of the children's book
department at the St Vincent Street branch of John Smith's in Glasgow.
We started with what used to be known as ''first books'', aimed at the
six-to-18-months market. ''Once babies can focus,'' says Barry Fogarty,
''they like bold colour schemes and simple direct illustrations.'' Lynne
James says: ''Small babies are particularly fascinated by photographs,
especially of other babies, animals, and anything with wheels.'' Betty
Root's 300 First Words may not sound like Booker short-list material
but, she says, it's probably the most popular book in her library for
the under-ones. The formula couldn't be simpler: exhaustive research
into what figures in a baby's world, plus pin-sharp brightly coloured
photos of each one. The Dorling Kindersley Snapshot range of board books
uses the same formula. Contrast these with the ornate busy illustrations
and pastel shades of some so-called baby books, for example the
Ahlbergs' Baby's Catalogue and Peepo! Could it be that these books are
famous because adults like them rather than babies?
''Once a child can put together even a two-word sentence, they're
ready for simple stories,'' says Fogarty. Colour and simplicity are
still important but strong characters and a good storyline start to
figure. The ever- popular Meg and Mog books (Helen Nicoll and Jan
Pienkowski) exemplify that formula and though some parents hate them,
most babies are drawn to the brash colour schemes and the endearingly
dotty Meg. The same bold use of colour and gentle humour made Eric
Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar an instant classic 25 years ago and
it's still in the top 10. Though none of his many follow-ups quite
achieve the same perfection, every one is a best-seller.
Between 18 months and two years, gradually characters and their antics
start to take on more importance. Perhaps the biggest baby book
phenomenon in recent years has been Mark Inkpen's irresistable Kipper,
the dog with as many insecurities as cuddly toys. Inkpen has just come
up with a character for even younger children. Watch out for Wibbly Pig
Is Upset, a 14-page #2.99 board book which runs through the entire gamut
of the toddler's emotional landscape from cheerfulness to desolation and
back. Apart from being clever and funny, such books help small children
find words to express their feelings.
Few can have understood this better than Shirley Hughes, whose series
about the vulnerable yet resourceful Alfie are still big sellers after
15 years or more.
''People think it's easy to write books for little kids. They say:
'Here's a monster, there's a fairy.' But it's incredibly difficult to
put together something that both relates to their lives and fires their
imaginations,'' says Barry Fogarty.
In a library it's easy to see which books have hit their target, says
Lynne James. There the ones stuck together with jam and Sellotape, the
ones that have been loved to bits. As she speaks she picks up
disintegrating copies of Sarah Garland's All Gone! and Oh No!. The
titles are ingeniously based on the two most common phrases used to
babies and they are brilliant. Lynne challenges any parent or baby not
to recognise the scenes depicted here.
Alongside colour and characterisation, we should consider rhyme and
rhythm. If a baby in the womb can be affected by music or the
undulations of its mother's voice, surely babies can be soothed or
excited by poetry long before they understand all or indeed any of the
words. ''Definitely,'' says Lynne James who swears by the soporific
power of Is There Anyone There? by Una Leavy and the therapeutic power
of When We Were Very Young by A A Milne. Among contemporary writers we
agreed Michael Rosen is the king of baby soothers. Lynne would choose
his We're Going on a Bear Hunt (illustrated by Helen Oxenbury). I would
opt for All Join In with wickedly funny Quentin Blake illustrations.
But the single biggest growth area in baby books lies in the crossover
between books and toys. Some of these gimmicks are not new.
Lift-the-flap books, for example, have been going for decades and, says
Lynne James, make perfect sense for babies. ''What's a baby's favourite
game? Peepo. So a book that plays hide and seek with them is lovely.''
But what about the rapidly expanding choice of other gimmicks: scratch
and sniff, post-its, slide books, books with rude noises, books you can
cuddle, books with teddys, and (the latest) books with Duplo. Some of
the most crass recent examples involve the relentless repackaging of old
favourites such as Rupert and Thomas the Tank Engine.
Predictably perhaps, bookseller and librarian differ on these. Fogarty
of John Smith's says: ''Publishers are trying to make books more like
toys because they know that if children start by playing with books,
they'll get used to reading them later.''
''The problem with that,'' says Lynne James, ''is that they don't get
into the habit of reading as fun. If books are simply other toys,
children are robbed of discovering the simple joy of turning the pages
and following a story.''
We've said a lot here about what is and what isn't a good book for the
under-threes. In a way, I want to finish by advising you to ignore it.
It's impossible to say who will like what. One hundred two-year-olds
would probably pick 100 different books and next week they might pick
another 100. Toddlers with older siblings or lots of adult books around
them will often defy convention by developing passionate attachments to
books they can only dimly understand. My two-year-old son happily joins
family reading sessions of Asterix and Tintin. A friend, now retired,
recalls a babyhood spent poring over a manual of newts and lizards to
the exclusion of all other books.
''I'd never say 'get this' or 'forget that'. You've got to go with
what attracts them,'' says Lynne the librarian. ''I hate Richard Scarry
but my children loved him. I loathed Tootles the Taxi but it is an
enduring favourite to thousands of kids,'' says Lynne.
Perhaps the best answer to my original question lies in those books
which appeal to both child and reader. Lots of baby books work well for
junior but bore mum stiff. In other cases, I fear, the reverse is true.
Says Lynne James: ''The test of a good book is that your child asks
you to read it every night for six weeks and you don't mind.''
Here is a selection of recent publications:
BOOKS FOR BABIES SIX-MONTHS PLUS.
My Clothes, My Food, My Toys, My Home. (Dorling Kindersley #1.99).
A new series of chunky board books of familiar objects and first
words. Bright primary colours and clear photographs. All very squeaky
clean and PC. Healthy food, neat smiley babies, and no mess anywhere.
Good Night Baby, All About Baby, Baby and Friends, Good Morning Baby!
(DK #2.99 each).
Larger format with padded covers, this series explores the everyday
world of babies. Simple one-line text.
Bathtime, Bedtime, Farm Friends, etc. (Campbell Books, now an imprint
of Macmillans #1.99 each).
A stalwart in the baby and toddler market, Rod Campbell has recently
joined forces with Maureen Roffey, another big name in little people's
books to produce a set of nine bold basic board books for babies.
Elmer's Splash. (Andersen Press #2.99).
The ubiquitous patchwork elephant has appeared in just about every
format available. Finally, she's made it into a clever bath book which
appropriately squirts as well as squeaks.
COLOURS AND NUMBERS ETC.
Colours. By Maureen Roffey (Campbell Books #2.99).
Small chunky people like small chunky books -- this one is a cube with
tough board pages and a little slip-in case. Well proofed against tiny
vandals and well laid-out with solid colour on the left facing a simple
object opposite in said colour.
Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See? By Bill Martin Junior (Picture
Puffin #3.99).
A new paperback of this classic illustrated by Eric Carle. The simple
rhyming text introduces tinies to colours and animals and reminds them
that children come in different colours too.
Numbers. By Maureen Roffey (Campbell books #2.99)
Same ultra chunky format as Colours (see above).
The Bean 123. By Richard Fowler (Macmillan #3.99).
New paperback of an old favourite. Beans don't just make you fart.
Here they ski, wash elephants, mine for gold, and hold great parties!
Peter Rabbit's ABC 123. (F Warne and Co #7.99).
Many recent reworkings of the Beatrix Potter tales are so crass that
they completely empty the stories and characters of any charm or
subtlety. This one scores on account of its classic approach.
Reproductions are all taken from the original illustrations.
Rooster's Off To See The World. By Eric Carle (Hamish Hamilton #9.99).
It's hard to believe that Carle has been turning out his colourful
collages for 25 years now. Parents brought up on The Very Hungry
Caterpillar (the wacky classic about a junk food binge) can teach their
toddlers numbers with a new edition of this counting book in which one
rooster meets two cats, who run into three frogs who encounter four
turtles. You get the idea.
Also watch out for Alphabats, due out in September. Backed by a
#250,000 marketing campaign from Transworld, it's an ingenious and fun
new way to teach very young children their letters.
TODDLER NON-FICTION.
This market is dominated by Dorling Kindersley whose worldwide selling
power enables them to do giant print runs (100,000 plus) and price their
goods very keenly. Their clear, clean, colourful photographic images are
carefully selected to be both PC and appeal to a worldwide market.
See How I Grow. By Angela Wilkes (DK #5.99).
This is a delightful photographic record of a baby's first 18 months
from sleepy, splay-footed tiny bundle to coquettish one-and-a-half year
old, trying on mum's shoes and hats.
Baby's Book of Nature. By Roger Priddy (DK #5.99).
The photographs in this introduction to the natural world are so
stunning they seem to start off the page at you. Rain on a flower, a new
duckling learning to swim, peas and blackberries that make you want to
eat them. Includes a section on counting and matching.
Who Says Moo? By Ruth Young (Viking #9.99).
The simple rhyming text and illustrations introduce toddlers to the
animal kingdom: ''Who can tie himself in knots? Who has stripes? Who has
spots?''
FIRST STORIES FOR TODDLERS.
Once children start stringing words together they are ready for simple
stories. These give them words to express their feelings and help with
the socialisation process. And of course they can be enormous fun.
Wibbly Pig is Upset, Wibbly Pig likes Bananas, etc are a brand new
series of six brilliantly simple board book stories from Mark Inkpen.
Toddlers will readily identify with this captivating piglet who loses
his ice-cream but finds a friend or enjoys his wrapping paper more than
his presents (Hodder #2.99 each).
Foxy Loses His Tail. By Colin and Jacqui Hawkins (Collins #3.99).
Foxy's tail isn't in the washing machine or the toy cupboard, it isn't
even down the toilet. The rumbustious earthiness this couple bring to
their books for older children is apparent here too, and there is a nice
twist in the tail, so to speak.
Out And About With Tom And Pippo. By Helen Oxenbury (Walker Books
#3.99).
Oxenbury is one of the biggest names in this field on account of her
funny characterisations, both verbal and visual, of the joys and trials
faced by little people. This new paperback brings together six of the
much-loved stories about the relationship between a boy and his monkey.
Excellent value.
Wheres My Teddy? By Jez Alborough (Walker #4.50).
Losing a favourite cuddly and getting lost in dark woods are both
well-worn themes in books for small children. This tale combines the two
in a way which is both scary and reassuring. This is just the right
formula for toddlers who generally enjoy being frightened, provided they
know everything is going to work out in the end.
LIFT-THE-FLAP AND OTHER GIMMICKS.
Goldilocks and The Three Bears. By Maureen Roffey (Heinemann #7.99).
Last year's gimmick was books with funny noises activated by pressing
different symbols. The latest is books in which the young reader is
invited to use a few bits of Duplo to build bridges and the like and so
help Goldilocks through her adventure. This is one of four on offer.
Longest Book Ever. By Richard Scarry (Collins #7.99).
You either love Scarry or hate him. Our banana-loving two-year-old
loves this 3m long fold-out train with flaps to lift on each carriage in
the quest for Bananas Gorilla's next supply.
Lift-The-Flap Animal Book. By Rod Campbell (Macmillan #4.99).
A paperback version of Campbell's compilation of animal rhymes. Bold,
bright pictures, simple text, and good quality flaps and binding.
All Together Now. By Nick Butterworth (Collins #8.99).
From the creator of Percy the Park Keeper comes a new character for
two and three-year-olds. A little boy wants to go on a picnic but first
we have to find his friends.
All Kinds Of People By Emma Damon (Tango Books #7.99).
What makes you you? Does your hair lie flat or stick up like a loo
brush? Have you got freckles or glasses? A clever and amusing
celebration of human diversity using the lift-the-flap formula.
Are you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin.
Anne Johnstone and Adam, two.
''The first sentence Adam ever put together was 'Read my a book'. They
are completely central to his world and we have hundreds of them. At six
months he had his own library tickets and, because we don't have
television, books are his main way of illuminating his experience and
seeing beyond it. But they are much more than that. As the smallest
member of a large and boisterous household, Adam uses books to get a
spot of peace and a cosy snuggle with me or whoever happens to be in
charge. I suppose books took over where breastfeeding left off. Of
course sharing a story is an intimacy Dad can enjoy too, and fathers
with older sons have admitted to me that they miss the warmth and
closeness of curling up with a boy and a book.
A lot of our books are aimed at older children and Adam often selects
one of these. Provided there's a picture on every page, he'll listen to
just about anything. Just now he's very keen on Mairi Hedderwick's Katie
Morag stories and The Megamogs by Peter Haswell.
After two girls, Adam's apparently innate passion for anything with
wheels took us rather by surprise. At various times The Big Red Bus Ride
by Peter Curry and Tractor Factory by Elinor Bagenal and Steve Augarde
have occupied his number-one slot. Last week, both nursing flu, we spent
a whole day flying jet planes, chugging along in tractors, and operating
giant excavators, all from the comfort of our old armchair. Made to
choose one, he picked Giant Machines (DK Snapshot Series #3.50).''
Lorraine Elliott and Mhairi, three
''Whatever Next! by Jill Murphy (MacMillan #7.99) was one of the first
toddler books I bought for Mhairi when I thought it was time to move on
from word books and nursery rhymes.
She was about 18 months and she loved it straight away. As soon as it
was bedtime, she would run upstairs and grab it off the shelf.
Soon she started joining in with bits, especially 'WHOOSH! Out into
the night' when the baby bear takes off for the moon in his cardboard
box. Within weeks she knew the whole book off by heart. If you say the
first word in the sentence, she'll finish it off. This is very handy for
impressing grandparents and the like. Some think she can read!
Soon Mhairi started using the book for her imaginative play. I'd find
her in the washing basket with a colander on her head. 'I've just been
to the moon,' she'd say. The story is very simple but she could relate
to it. She doesn't like witches or bad things in stories but there's
nothing in this to frighten her.
Now she's a bit older she's looking for longer stories. Things like
Enid Blyton or the Disney books. When I'm breastfeeding her wee sister,
I often put Mhairi on the other side and read to her.
When I was pregnant, books were a real godsend. Mhairi had just given
up her daytime sleep and I needed to read to her to give myself a break
from running around.
We use books to help her deal with new life experiences. A few months
ago, it was new baby books, to prepare her for the new arrival. She
especially liked the Usborne Book The New Baby, by Anne Civardi and
Stephen Cartwright. When I took her to the dentist, it was Topsy and Tim
go to the Dentist.''
Heidi Cameron and Jamie, two
''It could have been the ultimate nightmare: a 23-hour flight from
Australia on my own with Jamie, who was 18 months and very active. Then
I discovered My Quiet Book. It's a cloth book made in the Philippines
with a different activity on every page. For instance, one page has a
big ladybird with a zip pocket containing lots of little ladybirds.
There's an apple tree with lots of red apples fixed on with velcro tabs.
Another page has different shapes and colours to match up. Another has
different sorts of material to feel. It kept him occupied for hours
because there were so many different things to fiddle with and talk
about.
Jamie is a real dynamo, and with number two on the way, I get tired
chasing round after him but fortunately he loves books. It's a great way
to relax together. Initially his concentration span was very short but
now he wants a whole story. He's also moving from word books (like the
Thomas Big Book of Words) to story books. He always seems to know
exactly what he wants and will demand, for example, an Alfie book or a
Thomas book. He often goes through phases of wanting one particular book
for two to three weeks, then goes on to something else.
He loves looking for the moon and we have two books about the moon
which he's especially fond of. They are Goodnight Moon a really old
American book by Margaret Wise Brown, and I Want to See the Moon by
Louis Baum and Niki Daly (a Picture Puffin).''
* To order The Quiet Book, send a cheque for #20.99 (inc. P&amp;P) made
out to ''Taylor's Dolls and Crafts'' at Clayton Square Shopping Centre,
Liverpool L11 QR.
Sally Harnett and Jonathan, two
''I remember sitting and reading to our first child for ages when she
was little. Now, with three of them to look after, I have to make a
point of sitting down to read to Jonathan. If I'm busy, he'll sit and
look at a book by himself, although it takes a bit of persuasion.
Sometimes I'll come into the room and find him reading a book or
magazine. Quite often Katie, our seven year old, will read to the little
ones.
We've got hundreds of children's books in the house and Jonathan
doesn't necessarily choose ones aimed at his age group. But I have
noticed he has a distinct preference for bright colours.
When he was smaller he wanted me to read the same books over and over,
and he still has his favourites. For a long time he's been very fond of
The Bus Stop by Nancy Helen (an ABC book, #5.95). It's very simple.
Passengers arrive at the bus stop one by one. They are all off to do
different things and at the end the bus arrives. This page is cut away
so when you turn it over it looks as if the people have got on. Though
he still asks me to read it, he knows it off by heart. Sometimes I hear
him reading it to himself when he's on the potty.
There are some books that are very special to me. Our first child,
Rachel, died of meningitis and I suppose I try to persuade Jonathan to
listen to the books Rachel particularly loved, especially the Shirley
Hughes ones about colours, numbers etc. He listens OK but he wouldn't
pick them out.''

One Raining Morning, Robert Cray (Mercury)
* WOKE up this morning and diddlode, if I ain't done gone and got me a
bad case of them tasteful, soul-tinged blues again. Post-modern
blues-mama, hear my plea. Of course, Robert Cray is the fellow who
invented this condition, and he is kicking off the British leg of his
European tour in the Gallowgate sector of our city this very evening.
His new album reveals that while there are no hellhounds on Robert's
trail, at least his brand of blues lite is delivered with muscular
commitment.
Post, Bjork (one Little Indian)
* THE long-awaited second instalment of the elfin Ms Gudmundsdottir's
glacial otherworldliness. As before, you get monolithic chunks of looped
dance beats; the occasional florid swathe of fifties-vintage Hollywood
strings and some frail-but-insistent lullabies. But stuff the musicology
and the lit crit, pal -- is it any good? Not as good as it was the last
time. Nevertheless, the view from Mt Bjork remains a haunting one.
Cold Water Flat, Cold Water Flat (MCA)
* AS scuzzy, loud and angst-ridden power trios go, Cold Water Flat
have their volume levels set at 11 on all counts. Their debut album
sports a sense of all-American adolescent alienation, convincingly fiery
guitars, and a heap of sensitive, well-structured songs. Cold Water Flat
are good enough to remind me of the long-lost Dumptruck, in fact. Anyone
else out there remember Dumptruck? Thought not. Until Dumptruck
resurface -- which looks very unlikely -- we can safely let the melodic
Cold Water Flat fly a flag of distress for the post-Nirvana generation.
DAVID BELCHER
Shostakovich String Quartets, Vols 1/3, The Beethoven Quartet
(Consonance)
* GENUINE collectors' items here. This is an authentically historic
series of recordings (volume four has just been released) of the
complete cycle of Shostakovich's 15 string quartets, the most important
example of the genre since Beethoven's. The group -- and this is the
crucial, and not fully appreciated, information -- is the original
Beethoven Quartet. Formed in 1923 by young graduates of the Moscow
Conservatory, the quartet quickly established itself, and became
associated with almost every single new work produced in the country.
The original line-up stayed together for an astonishing 42 years. And it
shows consistently in performances that reflect every laconic turn of
phrase and every moment of blistering intensity. This is a dazzling and
seminal set of performances. Available at mid-price, the discs are an
absolute must. Volume One contains the first, second, and fourth
quartets, and Volume Three the third and sixth.
MICHAEL TUMELTY
Into the Blue, Guy Barker (Verve)
* THE accompanying campaign suggests that Barker is being seen as
British jazz's latest great hope. And splendidly equipped for the task
this trumpeter is too, with a gorgeous tone, great control and
articulation, and a band that is with him every step of the way through
ballads, latin rhythms and some cheeky updates of the New Orleans
tradition. Catch him at Glasgow International Jazz Festival.
Troika, Oregon (Verabra)
* AS the title confirms, since percussionist Trilok Gurtu's departure
Oregon's three surviving original members -- Ralph Towner (guitar, piano
and synth), Paul McCandless (oboe and English horn), and Glen Moore
(bass) -- are continuing with business pretty much as usual. A couple of
aimless free pieces aside, this is mostly acoustic music played with the
geniality and mutual understanding that 25 years together brings.
ROB ADAMS
Live at Brecon Jazz Festival, Scott Hamilton (Concord)
* WONDERFUL recording of tenorman Hamilton in concert last summer with
his preferred British rhythm section: Brian Lemon (piano), Dave Green
(bass) and Allan Ganley (drums). The thoughtful selection includes what
seems to be Hamilton's new signature tune -- Dizzy Gillespie's funky Ow
-- and a swinging version of the little-heard-these-days Way Down Yonder
in New Orleans.
Ec-Stacy, Jess Stacy (Living Era)
* FABULOUS 25-track collection spanning the range of pianist Stacy's
talents -- as a soloist or frontliner on tracks like the classic
Barrelhouse (1935), as an accompanist -- to his wife, the superbly
breathy singer Lee Wiley -- or as the backseat driver of the bands of
Benny Goodman and Eddie Condon. Highlights include the two Wiley numbers
(Paper Moon and Down to Steamboat Tennessee) and the Bob Cats' spicy
Spain.

Ken Gallacher finds pianist Keith Ingham in New York earning his
weekly bread and butter.
One of the jazz world's best-kept secrets can be found playing almost
nightly behind the imposing facade of New York's Regency Hotel.
It's there on fashionable Park Avenue that the London-born pianist
Keith Ingham plies his trade between recording sessions and jazz
festivals and gigs with all star bands around the States.
The cocktail bar of the Regency, one of those posh watering holes on
the upper East Side, is, however, the place where Ingham earns his
weekly bread and butter.
He plays show tunes there. Or present day popular songs. But mostly he
plays the standards and if he recognises a jazz fan in the house then he
will take off into an Ellington medley or a few Fats Waller numbers.
If you get really lucky then there are the nights when Ingham will
play piano duets with Jack Lemmon who, incidentally, has just issued a
CD under his own name on which he plays with some of the better-known
West Coast jazzers.
Lemmon, says Ingham, is an accomplished jazz piano player. ''I love it
when he comes here,''says the 53-year-old Londoner. ''He can play and he
knows the good songs and it's a kinda fun night when he walks in. Some
of the rest of the people who are there on these nights have to do a bit
of a double-take. But it's Jack Lemmon all right and he knows what he is
doing around a piano.''
So does Ingham, of course. And he has done for all the 30 or more
years I have known him. After making a permanent move to New York in
l978, he worked with Benny Goodman, the extravagantly named and
extravagantly gifted World's Greatest Jazz Band, with veterans such as
Max Kaminsky and Bud Freeman and Vic Dickenson, and with singers too.
Ingham's knowledge of the world of American Popular Song is
encyclopaedic. Some years he tracked down a batch of obscure Harold
Arlen tunes, worked out arrangements for a small jazz group and
persuaded Peggy Lee to sing them.
''It all worked,''he said,''until we had a problem with the Arlen
estate and that delayed things. But we had good musicians available and
Peggy Lee was the only possible choice we could make to sing these
songs.
''Eventually we were able to untangle the red tape and the CD was
released and people were able to listen to eight beautiful songs that
had never been recorded, as well as some other neglected gems from one
of the truly great song writers.''
The CD, titled Love Held Lightly, features veteran clarinettist Phil
Bodner who spent too many years lost to the studios, trombonist George
Masso and tenor saxophonist Ken Peplowski among others.
Interspersed with his various vocal and small group projects, Ingham
still finds time for solo piano excursions. One CD on the Canadian
Sackville label displays the breadth of his taste. There are tunes by
Benny Golson and Jimmy Yancey, by Billy Strayhorn and Don Ewell, and by
Alec Wilder and John Lewis.
Just now he has another CD about to be released and is working on
another with singer Barbara Lea.
In the meantime we can enjoy his last offering on the Jump label,
recorded last year. There are two CDs, Keith Ingham's New York Nine is
the name of the band, and there are some fine medleys which will
transport you back to Eddie Condon's Club in the forties and fifties and
some little recorded gems, Save Your Sorrow is one and By the Fireside,
featuring trombonist Dan Barrett, is another.
Meanwhile, as well as combing the musical archives for the unusual,
Ingham will keep up to date with current material for his gig at the
Regency.
He smiles as he remembers one request he had to play a few years back.
''A group of guys came in this night and they were sitting away from
the piano and I couldn't really see them. Anyhow one of them came up and
asked me to play the Bette Midler song The Wind Beneath My Wings. I
finished it and he came back and paid a hundred dollar tip on me. This
happened several times -- it was a nice feeling -- and then, as they
were leaving he returned and told me 'That's Mr Gotti's favourite
song.(It was indeed Mafia bos John Gotti who was in the company.) He
liked that . . .' and I was just glad I had known the damned tune.
That's why I keep my ears open, you never know who might drop in.''

AMNESIA thrillers, apart from the pleasure of joining in on the line
Who am I?, tend to be pretty forgettable affairs. Cult favourite Hal
Hartley's latest, Amateur (rental, cert 15), however, ought to linger
longer in the memory.
The interesting thing about our hero here (Martin Donovan) is that,
unlike the hero of any other amnesia thriller I know, he doesn't really
want his memory back all that much; as the other players gradually drop
hints about the kind of ratfink he used to be -- pornographer,
wife-beater, pimp -- he comes to prefer the caring, sensitive bloke he
is now. Amazing what a bump on the head can do for the personality,
especially when you get it from being pushed out of a New York window by
your wife (Elina Lowensohn) in a defenestration that starts the whole
story rolling.
Thinking that Donovan's dead, Lowensohn runs away from the scene with
plans to make a new life for herself, but then along comes Isabelle
Huppert (an ex-nun and virginal nymphomaniac who writes erotic stories
for a magazine -- yes, it's that doggedly realistic kind of movie) to
take him home and take him in while he tries, not very hard, to work out
who he is and how he got there. Meanwhile, however, some of his old
business associates are more concerned with finding out where he is, so
they can kill both him and Lowensohn and retrieve certain computer disks
-- that's the good old McGuffin -- that could send certain important
parties to jail. With us so far?
From here on in, Amateur becomes a pleasantly offbeat variation on the
standard-issue Hollywood chase-and-conspiracy plot, only scripted and
edited in the leisurely French manner with plenty of stops for
irrelevant digressions, comic turns, and chats about la vie, etc.
Although this makes Amateur rather slow for a thriller, the collision
between style and story turns out to be rather a good idea once you get
accustomed to the pace and the general atmosphere of goofy
inconsequentiality.
Those Royale-with-cheese-style digressions have led to this film
sometimes being mentioned in the same breath as Pulp Fiction, but this
is a much more tender-hearted and gentle piece altogether: there is some
gunplay towards the end, but the big set-piece shoot-out is
cartoonishly, surreally comic rather than disturbing. The gag sequences
too, most of them involving deranged Mob accountant Damian Young and/or
saintly policewoman Pamela Stewart, are deliciously crazy and help to
keep the tone light, while leaving room for a poignant resolution that
strikes some deeper notes about identity and choice. It's a lovely
little movie, as long as you don't expect to burst into fairy lights at
the sheer excitement of it all.
Irish director Joe Comerford follows up his underrated 1990 thriller
Reefer And The Model with the far darker entertainment High Boot Benny
(retail, #12.99, cert 15). It is a Troubles drama centred on the
discovery of a murdered police informer's body in the grounds of an
unconventional private school just inside the Republic. School matron
Frances Tomelty, teacher and ex-priest Alan Devlin, and slightly dopey
teenage handyman Marc O'Shea (Benny), all of them under suspicion, want
no part of either side of the Troubles.
That neutrality soon proves impossible to maintain, however, and the
three are dragged into a vortex of violence and death. Elegiac,
beautifully filmed, and passionately acted, this is a fine though
painfully bleak movie, strongly reminiscent of the Ken Loach style: file
next to Kes in your collection.

An appeal to raise #120,000 has been launched by the trustees of a
remarkable collection of Pre-Raphaelite-style art work, at the Lady
Waterford Hall, Ford, near Berwick-on-Tweed.
The money is needed to preserve and restore a series of wonderful wall
paintings which were done by the ''lady of the manor'' and mistress of
Ford Castle, Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford, between 1862 and 1883.
The pictures, all with religious themes, were completed with
watercolours on paper stretched on wooden frames and painted over with
distemper to tighten it like a canvas. The finished panels were put into
position round the walls of the local school which is now Ford village
hall. It is also a little known place of artistic pilgrimage for people
from across the country and abroad.
Lady Waterford called her 21-year enterprise of painting instructive
murals for the village school ''a great experiment''. She certainly
pulled it off. The north wall of the long schoolroom contains nine
scenes from the Old Testament; the south wall has the Child Jesus in the
centre flanked by various characters from the New Testament. The end
walls are covered with two massive scenes from the life of Jesus. The
pictures are all surrounded by designs of flowers, trees, birds, and
animals, and they would be sure to hold the attention and incite the
imagination of the most slothful pupil.
Lady Waterford's murals are still of interest today because she used
real people as the models for her Biblical scenes.
The curate at Ford, the estate joiner, the head gamekeeper, the wife
of the coachman and her children, the housekeeper, the head gardener's
sons, the lady's maid, the schoolmaster's daughter are only some of her
sitters whose names are remembered in a book kept in the hall. This book
is regularly consulted by Canadian, Australian, and American descendants
of families from Ford who make pilgrimages to the hall in search of a
sight of the likenesses of their ancestors.
Unless the current appeal is successful, they will not be able to do
this for much longer because already groups of angels painted above one
of the end wall scenes have been almost obliterated by a leak from the
roof. At the moment two panels have been removed for repair but much
more needs to be done and the trustees of the hall do not have the
resources to do it.
It would be a pity if the work of a considerable artist like Lady
Waterford was allowed to disappear. One of the fund-raising schemes
organised by the trust is a raffle with the prize being a watercolour by
Lady Waterford. It would be well worth winning.
Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford, was born in Paris in 1818 and her
father was British ambassador at the court of Louis XVIII of France. She
was extremely fond of her elder sister, Charlotte, who married Lord
Canning who became Governor-General of India. India did not agree with
Charlotte and she died there. Her sister was desolate and set up a
memorial to her at Ford.
In 1842 Louisa herself married a notorious rake, Henry, 3rd Marquess
of Waterford. He seemed to have changed his way of life when he married,
for Louisa was extremely devout and a strong supporter of the Temperance
movement. Some of her drawings record their domestic life with the
ex-rake reading peacefully in candlelight. The last drawing she made of
him was in 1859 when he was killed in a fall while hunting. When he was
brought home, she drew him in death.
During her long widowhood, for she survived until 1891, Louisa lived
most of the time at Ford where she built the school and transformed the
village, giving it the attractive appearance that it has today. She was
much loved by the local people who called her ''the good lady'' and she
seems to have involved her life very much with theirs in a way that was
not common among aristocratic ladies at that time. When her housekeeper
completed 50 years of service at Ford Castle, Lady Waterford gave a ball
in her honour. When the old gamekeeper was too lame to get to church,
she supplied him with a pony to ride.
Ford lies on the B6353, off the A697, south of Cornhill. Anyone
interested in viewing the murals can do so every day of the week during
the summer months from 10.30am till 5.30pm (with an hour off between
12.30 and 1.30 when the hall keeper goes for her lunch). During the
winter months -- October to Easter -- murals can be seen by appointment
and the telephone number is 0189 0820524. The same number can be used to
find out how to subscribe to an appeal that deserves support.
MARKET TIP.
AFTER my notice of the magazine Salvo which publishes information
about stolen items, another magazine that will be of interest to owners
of, and dealers in, valuable antiques and paintings has been brought to
my attention. It is Focus, a monthly which contains a comprehensive
survey, with photographs, of items recently stolen.
Focus costs #2.20 a copy, or #25 a year. The address is Trace
Publications Ltd, Mill Court, Furrlongs, Newport, Isle of Wight PO30

THE honourable Mrs Reginald Fellowes (1890-1962) had some original
ideas. Grand-daughter to Mr Singer of sewing machine fame and fortune,
this heiress had plenty of money and the time and inclination to torment
her friends. As far as her guests were concerned her hospitality was
less than entertaining.
Cruising on her yacht in the 1930s, Daisy Fellowes more or less
starved her visitors into submission by serving sparse portions of
tinned food. When ''urgent'' messages inevitably summoned home the
hapless travellers, the hostess with the leastest was unabashed. Another
of her little pranks was to set up dinner parties of people who had good
reason to loathe one another. The seating plan ensured maximum mutual
hostility.
She liked to seduce recent bridegrooms ''because it annoys their
wives''. And in order to inform one of her lovers that he had given her
gonorrhea, Daisy phoned him and kept clapping her hands beside the
mouthpiece.
Mrs Fellowes was recognised as one of the most fashionable women in
American and European high society.
Other American women who in their day hit the headlines were the
Duchess of Windsor and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. They too were
celebrated for their impeccable taste. They knew what suited them and
they suited themselves. The Wallis and Jacquie looks were instantly
recognisable. The decor in their houses, and their attention to such
details as flowers and table settings were endlessly reported.
The Power of Style (Aurum, #18.95) by Annette Tapert and Diana Edkins
is the book of the looks, the lives, works and leisure of 14 women who
cultivated their own image and influenced fashion. Though each was a
legend in her own lifetime, some of them are now largely forgotten.
Since every thread and gem of Chanel, Jacquie and Wallis have been well
documented in the past, it is the lesser figures like Daisy who spring
the surprises.
Many of the pictures in the book would not be out of place in today's
fashion features. Rita Lydig (1879-1929), a high-born Spanish New
Yorker, stares condidently from the pages. Despite her Gibson Girl
hairstyle and fancy clothes she has a modern, liberated air. Gloria
Guinness, posing for Vogue in 1949, looks ready for a posh gathering
today in her late day dress by Schiaparelli. Fifty years on, Slim Keith,
the original California Girl, appears relaxed and up to date in black

It was Slim who told her husband, Hollywood director Howard Hawks, that
she had seen a model in a magazine who would be just right to play
opposite Humphrey Bogart in To Have and to Have Not. So Lauren Bacall
got the part.
The Power of Style tells how the smartest of women could make the most
foolish choice of husbands. For some of the ladies who launched the
looks their elegant clothing was a means of climbing to the top. Or
perhaps it was a reward for having arrived at society's pinnacle and a
good reason to stand by your man. Trophy wives are nothing new.

LACRYMA CHRISTI -- Christ's Tear -- is one of those Italian wines
people advise you to avoid. The fact that it comes from the slopes of
Mount Vesuvius, upon which the Lord once reputedly wept, would be enough
to arouse anyone's suspicions. The first time I drank it was through
ignorance. Lunching many years ago in an Edinburgh restaurant, I ordered
a bottle to accompany a portion of scampi provincale. Its yellowness
should have been a giveaway, but I was too naive to know about that. It
was unctuously sweet, more expensive than it should have been, and
horrendously undrinkable. It was a long time before I tried it again.
In fact, a good Lacryma Christi is today a lot better than its name,
but it comes in so many guises -- red or white, sweet or dry, light or
heavy, fresh or oxidised -- that you can never be quite sure what you
are getting. To sip a cool, dry Lacryma Christi on the terrace of the
Gran Caffe Gambrinus, near the San Carlo Opera House in Naples, should
be enough to convince you that it is something quite special.
It tastes good, too, in the restaurants of Positano and Sorrento,
which is where most British tourists encounter it. The trouble is that
between there and here something tends to go wrong. It's not merely that
the wine does not travel but that it actively goes off. There is,
however, one sure guarantee of quality, and that is the sight of Antonio
Mastroberardino's name, in old-fashioned Gothic script, on the label.
This is the version of Lacryma Christi favoured by Edinburgh's most
comprehensive Italian wine suppliers, Valvona &amp; Crolla, and one taste of
it should be enough to tell you why Lacryma Christi has at last become a
wine to take seriously. Though the Mastroberardino family vineyards date
back to the eighteenth century or even earlier, that is not necessarily
in Italian terms a guarantee of quality. It is only since the Second
World War that there has been a genuine effort to make Christ's tears
truly palatable.
The result of this endeavour is a sensationally bright-tasting,
attractively citric wine, clean and appetising, with just a hint of the
five-fruit drinks sold in supermarkets, but with almondy overtones and
enough steel to hold its range of flavours and aromas together. Wines of
this complexity do not come cheaply, and it is no surprise that the 1993
vintage costs #10.69. But with it, at least, you get the legend of how
the Archangel Lucifer, ejected from Heaven, clung on with his
fingernails and planted his little fragment of Heaven on the shores of
the Bay of Naples. Discovering the loss, Christ wept tears that watered
what have been claimed to be the first vines on earth.
These Vesuvian vineyards produce two white wines even classier. Greco
di Tufo, from a village to the east of the volcano, is based partly on a
grape of Greek origin (said to predate the birth of Christ) and partly
on a grape called Coda di Volpa, or fox tail. The combination yields a
wine more tightly structured than Lacryma Christi, but with the same
delicate edge of almonds. Being in short supply, it is inevitably dearer
than Lacryma Christi (the 1993 vintage costs #13.49) but this is a
stupendous wine, one of the best of all Italian whites.
Even better is Fiano di Avellino, for which you will have to pay even
more, but the experience is said to be worth the extra. Unusually among
Italian white wines, these can be kept for several years, but the 1993
Greco di Tufo is pretty irresistible now.

THE smoked salmon had arrived by post for her birthday, a gift from a
friend but sent by a mail-order company. My elderly neighbour turned up
on the doorstep, distressed. She was sorry to trouble me, but she
thought something was wrong with it. What did I think? No, it wasn't
past its sell-by date. It just tasted lousy.
At the first sensation of greasy-wet slime my reaction was to spit it
out. Then came unpleasant chemical tastes which had nothing to do with
salmon, salt, or smoke. Was it an out-of-condition, under-exercised,
over-fed farmed fish? I didn't know. But she was right. It was smoked
salmon at its worst and she went off to mail it back in disgust.
To be honest, I rarely buy smoked salmon, mistrusting a product with
such a variable quality and feeling that money for food luxuries can be
better spent elsewhere.
Despite disasters like my neighbour's birthday present, Scottish
smoked salmon continues, for the moment at any rate, to hold its
reputation around the world. But will it stay in this prime position if
it continues to have such serious problems for the buyer? When will
something effective be done to save us from dud smoked salmon?
Some argue that wild salmon in season from a long-established
traditional smoker is the best bet. Food columnists go in for ''expert''
tasting sessions to find the best buy, while some rely on mail-order
companies who select (usually with care) from small rural smokehouses.
Several of the larger smoked salmon companies have tried to set a
standard with the Scottish Salmon Smokers Association's quality mark,
but this involves a high-cost membership fee which only large companies
can afford. Policing is done by the Seafish Authority and is a costly
business.
Another problem is bogus Scottish cures (which turned out to be my
neighbour's problem). Hijacking the Scottish tag for its prestige, there
are some labelled Scottish cures which may neither use Scottish fish nor
be smoked in Scotland, says Norman Maclean, secretary of the SSSA. He
knows of at least 13 convictions under the Trade Descriptions Act
against two companies and one individual.
The problem of less than wonderful smoked salmon cures has only
developed in the past couple of decades as salmon, reared commercially
on salmon farms, like chickens in battery cages, has moved into mass
production.
There are currently about 99 smokehouses in Scotland smoking about
14,000 tons of fish from Scottish waters in a year.Scotland has the
advantage of a farming industry which has grown up in the past couple of
decades alongside an old existing smoking industry.
While Norway's salmon must be transported to France or England for
smoking, in Scotland a close relationship has developed between fish
farmers and smokers, some farmers moving into smoking and vice versa.
Ex-salmon farmer, Mike Ross-Brown, who is now a director of Wigton Bay
Salmon Company and also owner of MacGilvray mail-order smoked salmon,
thinks most of the problems come from mass production. Though the major
multiples demand exacting standards from their suppliers and have the
purchasing clout to enforce them, in blind tastings it is frequently the
multiples' smoked salmon which comes out badly.
''Several salmon farmers,'' he says, ''are now rearing their fish at
relatively low stocking densities in fast-flowing water on a naturally
balanced -- not too high energy -- diet. These salmon are almost
indistinguishable from the wild stock and smoke beautifully. They cost a
little more, certainly, but if there was more demand, more would be
produced.''
Smoking is a craft-skill with a hands-on element which, he argues,
cannot be successfully automated on a large scale.
Compare the difference in production between a small and a large
smoker. The small-scale traditional smoker dry-salts for about 15 hours,
dries out the fish for about 10 hours, and smokes for about 16 hours
depending on the weather and size of the fish. At every stage there is a
need to control the process by the ''gut feeling and nose'' of the
smoker.
In a large-scale process there may be fast-injection brining: a system
of injecting the fish with salt through needles which is practised in
France and other countries, though, according to the SSSA, not used in
Scotland. An automatic smoker is set by computer to control the rest of
the process and the personal supervision element is lost.
All smoked salmon, as we may continue to discover to our cost, is not
born equal.
* THE first Scottish early potatoes from Ayrshire have been around in
small quantities now for a couple of weeks but this weekend lifting gets
into full swing.
''Two degrees of extra heat from the Gulf Stream,'' says Alex Kyle of
Girvan Early Growers, ''gives us a crop of early potatoes each year
which beats the East coast earlies by about a couple of weeks.''

YOU may think sandwiches a rather unprepossessing subject for
discussion, but hold on -- they cover a vast area of variety. To lay my
cards on the table before I go any further, I love sandwiches, of most
sorts. I applaud the Earl of Sandwich for supposedly inventing them as a
means of enabling him to eat, and therefore stay alive, while he spent
his every waking moment at the gambling table.
But there are sandwiches and sandwiches. A good sandwich should be
buttered liberally right up to the crusts on each piece of bread. The
filling should be generous, and not consist of a blob of egg mayonnaise,
say, right in the middle of the sandwich with just bread round the
edges.
The fillings should have a contrast of dry and moist foods, by which I
mean that a sandwich made with cold, sliced meat can be an awfully
unpleasant thing to eat because of its dryness, whereas by adding some
greenery in the form of crisp lettuce leaves of varying types, and by a
spreading of mustard -- and mayonnaise too if you like -- the cold meat
sandwich is transformed.
There are some fillings to avoid -- and tomatoes, just sliced, are
one. Packed for any length of time, a tomato sandwich becomes a soggy
mass, with the tomato as one with its encasing bread. To a certain
extent you can avoid the sogginess by insulating the bread with lettuce
leaves, so the tomato slices don't come into direct contact with the
buttered bread. Personally, I like Marmite with a lettuce and tomato
sandwich.
Sandwich fillings are very much a matter of personal preference. With
six in our family I am lucky that we do have one favourite among us all
(apart from smoked salmon, that is, but more about that in a minute)
which consists of hardboiled eggs cut up and mashed with a fork with
softened butter and a small amount of mayonnaise, and with crisply
cooked bacon, broken into bits and mixed through the egg.
This, like any sandwich filling, needs to be well seasoned, and I use
about a teaspoonful of mustard (English) salt and pepper and a dash of
Tabasco. I also line the buttered bread with lettuce to prevent any
potential sogginess from the egg filling. I recommend this filling to
anyone -- and it travels well; this is a very real consideration when
you are thinking what to use for sandwich fillings, because sandwiches
are such convenient and portable food, depending on their filling.
If the filling isn't composed of bite-sized, or smaller, bits, the
slices of whatever must be of a texture that they are easily bitten.
Chicken, for instance, can be bitten easily, whereas some roast ham is
awfully tough to bite, and you feel inelegant, to say the least, with a
trail of sliced ham hanging down your chin because your teeth couldn't
do the job a knife should have done in the sandwich making.
Fish makes delicious sandwich fillings. Sardines seem to have gone out
of fashion but not in this house. Sardines (I think the nicest are
tinned in oil) mashed with a fork and mixed with skinned, de-seeded and
chopped tomatoes, make one of the best sandwich fillings.
The recipe today is for sardines made into a pate with mushrooms --
truly a perfect filling; and don't be put off if you don't like
sardines, because Godfrey loathes them and yet he loves this pate.
Still on the subject of fish-based sandwich fillings, the ultimate in
sandwich luxury is the smoked-salmon sandwich. But the smoked salmon
must be very good, it goes without saying, and I like to make a lemon
and dill butter with which I spread the bread, by chopping dill and very
finely grating lemon rind, and beating them into softened butter with a
good grinding of black pepper.
And then there is the other vital element in these luxurious
sandwiches, and indeed all sandwiches -- the bread. For smoked salmon it
has to be brown bread. Whether you, like me, prefer the malted grain
granary bread or the plain wholemeal depends entirely on your taste.
Some sandwiches need white bread, but this is so much better if it is
cut from a baked loaf as opposed to a sliced, steamed loaf.
Tomato and cucumber sandwiches are, for me, white-bread sandwiches.
Egg-based fillings can be either, but I prefer brown, and granary at
that. Then there are buns. I recommend buns for the pate filling in the
recipe below, but whenever I use buns for sandwiches I split them in
half with a serrated knife and pull out dough from the centre of the bun
-- this lets you put in more filling.
The last type of sandwich isn't portable, and is meant to be a quick
and delicious lunch or supper dish. It is toasted bread sandwiches -- by
this I don't mean those machines in which you toast the whole sandwich
-- I mean sandwiches made with toast.
It must be freshly made, and the most usual filling is buttered toast,
mayonnaise, crisply grilled bacon, white chicken or turkey, lettuce and
tomato. It is usually served in three layers of bread, rather than the
more usual two layers of bread in a sandwich.
Sardine and mushroom Pate buns
This amount fills 8 buns generously
3 oz butter
1 lb mushrooms, wiped, stalks trimmed and chopped
8 oz cream cheese such as Philadelphia
2 tins of sardines, well drained of their oil
Juice of [1/2] lemon, plenty of black pepper, and a dash of Tabasco
* Heat the oil and melt the butter together in a frying pan and cook
the chopped mushrooms over a high heat till they are almost crisp. Cool
them, then put them into a food processor and whiz, adding the sardines,
cream cheese, lemon juice, and seasonings. Split each bun in half, pull
out surplus dough from the centre, butter the buns and put a leaf of
crisp lettuce in each. Divide the pate between the buns and press each
down firmly with the palm of your hand. Cut each in half with a serrated
knife, and wrap in clingfilm.

THE KENNETH WILLIAMS LETTERS. Russell Davies (Harper Collins, #7.99).
* IF Kenneth Williams' friend Joe Orton had ever written a Carry On
script, it might have had something of the flavour of Williams' life as
reflected in these letters. Funny, fearful, vulgar, snobbish, bitchy,
wholly ludicrous but also rather brave, Williams was the leading man in
a lifelong black farce, Carry On Kenny, whose curtain line was a bottle
of pills. Two things stand out: the seriousness with which Williams took
his work, and his wretched inability to have fun. If he could have
enjoyed the world half as much as the world enjoyed him, he might still
have been messing about today.
KARL MARX: A Biography. David McLellan (Papermac, #10).
* TO most readers, even to many Marxists, the man who invented Marxism
is familiar only as a bronze beard in Highgate Cemetery. Which perhaps
is fair enough: Marxism has no truck with the Great Men view of history.
David McLellan's biography, however, reveals a complex and contradictory
man whose life story is worth telling, and he integrates this story well
with a clear and readable exposition of the development of Marx's ideas.
DAN LENO AND THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEM. Peter Ackroyd (Minerva, #6.99).
* CLOAKED Peter Ackroyd's macabre Victorian phantasmagoria is like one
of those lavish West End shows where you come out ''humming the
scenery''. Elegant and fascinatingly readable as it is, it has no
detectable ideas to flesh out its formal brilliance. The way in which
Karl Marx, the novelist George Gissing, and the music-hall genius Dan
Leno are shanghaied into a mystery chiller about a Ripperesque serial
killer is masterly, but in the end this is not a serious novel with
murder as its theme -- just a murder thriller seriously well written.
From the author of Hawksmoor, one expects more.
CAUSE CELEB. Helen Fielding (Picador, #5.99).
* THE trouble with this insider satire on glitterati charity is that
it can sometimes look as guilty as its targets of using Third World
disaster for its own ends. When publishing PR Rosie Richardson -- she's
our heroine, not a target -- becomes an aid worker in Africa, it's to
escape an unhappy affair; and even after she's organised a luvvie-laden
TV special to raise money for food for her refugees, one is left with
the feeling that God made a famine happen just so that she could find
true love with a hunky doctor from a relief agency.
DISPATCHES FROM THE FRONT LINE OF POPULAR CULTURE. Tony Parsons
(Virgin, #7.99).
* BLIMEY, Guv, wot a bleedin' title . . . can't you just see the red
tracer of publishers' contracts flying over Tony Parsons's head as he
crouches in his foxhole at the Groucho Club, spitting streams of
heavy-calibre abuse into what he calls The Tattooed Jungle? This
collection of journalism by The Late Show's blue-collar brainbox, from
his punk years on the New Musical Express to his present incarnation as
Hammer of the Yobs, is biliously provocative in spots but more often
just provoking; he's parlayed automatic political incorrectness and a
punchy line in truculence into a lucrative career as working-class
savant without much need for insight, sympathy, or sincerity. If you
think that sounds chippy and envious, you might be right.

CELESTINE - Voices From a French Village by Gillian Tindall.
Sinclair-Stevenson, #17.99.
SOMETIMES it is possible to believe that the love the French
tirelessly express for their native soil is shot through with more than
a little guilt.
Standing around the barbecue at the maison secondaire they may seem to
prove that the idea of la France profonde remains, as Gillian Tindall
suggests, almost the moral basis of the nation. But the truth is they
have been deserting the countryside in their millions since the Second
World War and before.
Things are improving a little now, belatedly. Patois is no longer
spurned -- though the snobbery attached to ''proper'' French makes any
argument over received pronunciation seem mild -- and the old ways no
longer despised.
Local culture is reviving, albeit patchily, in Provence, Brittany and
elsewhere, along with regional patriotism. It is as if the value all
those things -- houses, traditions and crafts -- which once were of
interest only to rustic-chic foreigners, is at last being recognised.
Nevertheless, Tindall reports that across rural France, so it is
estimated, one in 16 of all habitations is standing empty, not even in
occasional use. This can be explained in part by France's tortuous laws
of succession, in part by the effects of two world wars, in part by
changes in farming methods. But there is more to it than that, and
Celestine, a story so humanly true that Tindall is obliged to insist
that it is no fiction, helps to explain why.
Ironically enough, it is only because of the depopulation of which she
writes that the author was able to embark on this book. Buying a small
house at Chassignolles in the Berry, at the very heart of France, in the
1970s she came across a small bundle of letters in a shuttered room. The
episodic tale they told of an inn-keeper's daughter born in 1844, when
the region was covered in oak trees and wolves still roamed, and dying
in 1933 after wars, railways, education and rural mechanisation had
transformed communities essentially unchanged since the Middle Ages,
became something like an obsession.
Yet Celestine's life, fascinating as it is, is only the canvas for a
larger picture. The letters themselves came from various suitors. Sent
to her, they tell little about her. We hear how her brothers left the
village, how she took over the inn, made a less than satisfactory
marriage, and bore a son whose own married life, to a near-lunatic,
ruined the family business and caused his mother to end her life in
poverty. Alone, none of this might mean much.
But Tindall attaches such a richness of detail to the scraps of
biography that she achieves more than a portrait of a changing
community. All the facts are avowedly ''minor'' yet, taken together, say
something important. Celestine catches the very process of change. It is
imbued with a consciousness of the nature of time, of decay and renewal.
''Great cycles of growth and decay have occurred before,'' she says,
''and settlements have been destroyed and rebuilt hereabouts before,
several times over. This time too is only a stage.''
Thus at the end of the book it is somehow no surprise to read it
suggested that the region may again, and very soon, begin to revert to
wood, marsh and moorland, as though to challenge everything the
twentieth century is supposed to have been about.
It is interesting to compare this work with John Berger's Pig Earth
trilogy, a collection of fictions with a similar interest in the fate of
peasant life in an industrialised age. Berger found his stories -- they
rarely feel invented -- in the Haute Savoie, living and working among
the people. Yet he, like Tindall, seems fascinated by the discontinuity
of time, with how old and new overlap and mingle, of how several eras
can seem to be present simultaneously in the modern world.
Berger seeks, though, to ask what will happen to all of us when
peasant life is gone. Tindall never poses the question directly, as
though to suggest that the tragedy has already happened. Anyone who was
walked in eerie afternoon silence through a perfectly-restored medieval
hill village, as this reviewer has, and found that the owner of every
house has returned, their holidays concluded, to Paris, Lyon, Amsterdam
and London, begins to understand what it means when communities die.
Celestine is a powerful, haunting book that would, in a wiser world,
find its way to the desks of every European bureaucrat. One only hopes,
after their unsatisfactory encounter with Peter Mayle, that the French
themselves are allowed a chance to read it.

* Actress and TV presenter Clare Grogan tells ANN DONALD about the
books she has recently enjoyed.
I'M reading Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh at the moment which is one
of the most genuinely original books I've ever read. It's definitely a
book that you react to. I would be sitting on the tube and having to
stop myself from talking to the book -- I think it is quite incredible
that a writer can make you behave in that way.
The book didn't shock me in any way though he does describe things
that have never been written about before.
The consistency of his writing is brilliant, and it was amazing how
you get used to it because not once does he soften it. It's a book that
I'd actively encourage other people to read.
I also enjoy reading first novels by new authors so I picked up a book
by Kate O'Riordan called Involved. It's about the troubles in Ireland
and how they affect everyone's life even if they are not actively
involved. It's about the relationship between a boy from the Catholic
North and a girl from a wealthy middle-class Protestant family from the
South. If you can get past the horrific first chapter it becomes a
totally different book.
Every so often I make myself read books that I'd never usually read,
so I picked up The Beat Queen by an American author, Louise Erdrich. I
really loved that. It's about a family of orphans in North Dakota in
1932 and the book follows their lives.

DUTCH FLOWER PAINTING 1600-1720 by Paul Taylor. Yale University Press,
New Haven and London #29.95.
TULIPOMANIA? The 1980s speculation boom and bust was as nothing to the
1636-7 Dutch spree, the first great speculation crisis of modern
capitalism when top bulbs were auctioned for more money than the most
expensive houses in Amsterdam.
Crazy spending attracted strong reactions. At the height of the
frenzy, anti-tulip pamphleteers worked out that with 2500 guilders one
could buy 27 tons of wheat, 50 tons of rye, four fat oxen, eight pigs,
12sheep, two hogsheads of wine, four tuns of beer, two tons of butter,
and three of cheese, a bed with linen, a wardrobe of clothes and a
silver beaker. A rare white tulip flamed with red and purple cost up to
13,000 guilders.
At the beginning of Febrary 1637 Holland was awash with estatic paper
millionaires, their lives as weavers and carpenters behind them. Some
ordered horse-drawn carriages; others negotiated contracts on sumptuous
canal houses. But if you couldn't afford bulbs, you could at least
indulge in a painting. It's said that the flower piece was invented in
Antwerp, when a lady who could not aquire some tulips asked Jan Brueghel
to paint them for her.
So flower pictures, remarkable for their realism, were produced all
over Holland and, indeed, bought by Dutch families as lasting
substitutes for the real thing. Thus Dutch flower painting became
popular and has remained so ever since.
Most books on Dutch flowers painting of the Golden Age are satisfied
with presenting beautiful glossy colour illustrations of lavish bouquets
which defy gravity and the seasons: impossibly long stems of narcissi,
fritillaries, tulips, and roses in the same vase despite the fact that
these flowers bloom months apart. This volume has illustrations in
abundance but, in addition, plenty of scholarship. Taylor likes his
research and gives us copious background and context; quotes from
contemporary Dutch writers; details of symbolism; composition; painters;
even prices. (Pictures fetched from 15 guilders up to 1000 guilders, so
buyers were relatively wealthy.)
Surprisingly, it was unlikely that the Dutch would have been so
extravagant as to decorate their homes with bouquets of flowers like the
ones we see in the paintings. The blooms were far too expensive -- and
most growers would want the blooms to remain in the garden so as to last
as long as possible.
Flower painters were not economic outsiders in Golden Age Holland.
Most artists were middle-class. To become an artist at all one had to
come from a reasonably prosperous family. A painter's apprenticeship
took six years, at a cost of around 75 guilders a year. Families on an
average income of 450 guilders could not afford it. By the picture boom
of the 1600s, flower painting was a complex business requiring several
years' training. By the end of the century the only successful flower
painters were full-time professionals.
The four main painters in the early 1600s were de Gheyn, Jan Brueghel,
Bosschaert, and Savery. All of them liked symmetry, placed their
bouquets in the centre of the picture and allowed each flower to stand
out seperately. Spatial legibility became very sophisticated.
Of course all this tulipomania had a huge effect on the way people saw
floral still lifes. Many read a reflection of god's power and goodness
in the marvellous intricacy and beauty of nature -- and flowers were
often singled out as the loveliest examples of the Creator's handiwork.
For instance a lily could be seen as an exhortation to purity of soul.
Floral symbolism also included the more obvious reference to the
''gather ye rosebuds while ye may'' transience of earthly existence,
together with the traditional interpretations of a rose for love, the
violet for modesty and reserve, carnations for betrothal, a columbine as
a symbol of humility and love, the poppy for sleep and death.
Ordinarily gardeners, bulb enthusiasts, painters, and public would
find it difficult to envisage garden flowers as exotic, luxury objects
-- but after reading this book you will surely see spring flowers and
flower pictures through new eyes.

EXPLORING THE SCOTTISH PAST by T M DEVINE: (#12.99. 260pp Tuckwell
Press).
SOME of Professor Tom Devine's finest papers, stretching back over a
quarter of a century, are brought together in this handy volume. A man
so awesomely prolific might almost be thought to have a pact with the
devil, but though the collection casts its net wide it brings out
certain emphases which allow us to see the author's work in general
perspective.
The socal and economic history in which he specialises is very much a
product of western modernity. It is, to a great extent, history of the
masses, and the masses arose with the Industrial Revolution. It will be
interesting to see what happens to this sort of history now that the
masses are being atomised again.
Yet Devine, it seems clear here, has stood somewhat apart form the
mainstream, even though Scotland, an industrial country par excellence,
might have enticed him in that direction. His is rather the Scotland
standing on the threshhold of modernity, or more especially crossing it.
It is the mercantile Scotland, the Scotland of Adam Smith where men of
quite meagre means enriched themselves, and by extension their society,
through reaching out across the water to Irland the countries round the
North Sea, then across the ocean to North America. His full-length study
of The Tobacco Lords remains a classic, and some of the monographs which
went into it are included here.
Secondly his work is, to a surprising extent when one sees it brought
together, preoccupied with rural rather than urban Scotland. Most social
and economic historians concentrate on the growth of industry, the
expansion of cities, the new relations of capital and labour. Devine
seems to prefer looking at the other side of the coin, the dwarfing of
agriculture, the pull on it of extraneous forces, the strains in the
traditional societies it supported. He reminds us in his introduction
that his concern is with total interpretations, and his interest in
topics neglected by others has made a major contribution to them.
It is worth noting, too, that this book is the first from the Tuckwell
Press -- a resurrection, I hope, of the Scottish academic publishing
which has looked in danger of extinction.

MEN WITHOUT TIES by Gianni Versace. John Murray, #57.
IN ITALY'S pantheon of fashion gods, Gianni Versace is the paradox:
the divine heretic of sex. This golden son, from Reggio Calabria in the
smouldering south, both toils and idles in a paradise of flagrant
seduction, his menswear and women's collections rocking the monochrome
reserve of the bourgeoisie. For Versace subtlety is a denial of art, his
clothes defining an insolent narcissism made holy.
Lest the rest of us forget it, he produces extravagantly pagan books
as bibles setting out the doctrine of his mission. Men Without Ties is
the latest, a lavish study filled with lots of psycho-twaddle and Adonis
pictures by celebrated photographers including Richard Avedon, Herb
Ritts, and Bruce Weber.
''The erotic sensuality of the open neckline is the key element in
Versace's imagery,'' writes Richard Martin, curator of the Costume
Institute at the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York. It follows, then,
that Versace sees the tie as the instrument of bondage rather than
bonding, a repressive item, along with the collar, which has
''suppressed the male chest as an erogenous zone''. Throw it away, he
urges, throw it away and expose the male torso re-created as a figure of
freedom and gender beauty.
But pitched beyond the clamour of his fans, this is a futile message.
Throw away a tie, a collar, a suit, and most men believe they're on the
road to ruin. And well they might be: Gianni's lush album of snaps costs
#57.

THE DESTINY OF NATHALIE X and Other Stories by William Boyd. Sinclair
Stevenson #9.99.
THE emotional core of William Boyd's second collection of short
stories is a little more than half-way through. To be exact it is the
first sentence of the second paragraph of the sixth short story, Alpes
Maritimes. And it goes like so: ''I have a girl now -- Ulricke -- and so
everything should be all right. And it is, I suppose, except I want
Anneliese, her twin sister.'' Sexual desire in Boyd's male protagonists
is often unfocused. Drifting from one woman to another it remains the
thong which ties the finer tales together.
In Alpes Maritimes an anonymous narrator describes his amorous
adventure in Nice during the sixties. Involved with one sister, he
desires the second and so will do anything to prevent an older American
from making any moves. Both girls sleep in the same room as the narrator
but he is not content with just standing sentry on their slumber, he
also watches their waking. Like a petty little boy he prevents the Yank
from even walking beside them.
The same emotions are repeated in The Dream Lover when a British
student at a French language school, who cannot compete with his
American friend in terms of wealth, discovers the power of sexual
suggestion. Subtly he does not dismiss the false rumour that he is
involved with the object of the American's desire, who is trapped by the
arrival of his girlfriend.
The whole thing is like a revenge fantasy in retaliation for all the
times Boyd has been screwed over by Hollywood while he pursued his
second, and far less successful, career as a screenwriter.
Hollywood itself is stripped down to a few elequent sayings in the
title story, The Destiny Of Nathalie X, where an acclaimed African
director arrives in Tinseltown and begins shooting his second film at
the first cheap store he sees after leaving the airport. Told from the
points of view of various people it contains wisdom like:
''I have a theory about this town: it operates best when people go
beyond the bounds of acceptable behaviour . . . I have a theory about
this town: there's too much respect for art.'' Yet even the director
cannot edit matters of the heart as the lead actress whom he loves runs
away with the sound-recordist. In truth, Boyd strips Hollywood bare.
I like this book, a lot. It is a book about women, beautiful women who
are desired by men who want more and more, men who are rejected by
lovers, who cannot love, who love their daughters. The emotion of lust
tinged with love is beautifully written, it's smooth and polished and
sits like so much dead weight on the chest. Here it's a lust for the
good-life, for the quiet stylish country hotels, for fine foods and
cheeky wines.
Through the simplest lines Boyd can create an exotic, slightly surreal
atmosphere. He writes of standard things in a fresh manner, which always
conveys a deeper truth.
On sex he writes: ''We made love in the cool afternoon darkness of my
room. There was a strange relaxed confidence about it all, as if it had
been pre-figured in some way, in the unhurried tolerant manner our
bodies moved to accomodate each other.''

ROBERT GRAVES: His Life and Work by Martin Seymour-Smith. Bloomsbury,
#25.
ROBERT GRAVES: Collected Writings on Poetry. Paul O'Prey, editor.
Carcanet Press, Manchester, #35.
ROBERT GRAVES had a lunatic theory of poetry. He believed great, or
Gravesian, poems were produced under the influence of the White Moon
Goddess who is the Muse, the three stages of womanhood (man's mother,
mate, and mourner) and Goddess of the Heavens.
He worshipped the Woman in the Moon, celebrated her in such poems as
''To Juan at the Winter Solstice'', and made her the subject of his
prose work, The White Goddess (1948).
Though the White Moon Goddess was projected as a myth, she was
modelled on a mistress. Laura Riding -- born Laura Reichental in New
York, she divorced Louis Gottschalk in 1925 and took the surname Riding
after the publication of The Close Chaplet (1926), his first collection
of poems -- met Graves in 1926. He was then married to Nancy Nicholson,
a feminist who refused to use her married name, but his idea of domestic
bliss was to have another woman in the house. Shortly after meeting
Riding he took her -- and Nancy and their four children -- to Egypt
where he lectured at Cairo University for a year.
Back in England, Riding ruled over Graves and his wife. She could not,
however, rule over Geoffrey Phibbs who preferred Nancy. Riding decided
to end it all in 1929 and almost died after jumping out of a window, as
T E Lawrence explained in a letter to Mrs Bernard Shaw: ''She has broken
her pelvis and three bones in her spine . . . For love of an Irishman,
Geoffrey Phibbs (who did not love her any more), she had thrown herself
down four storeys into Graves's area of Chiswick''. Phibbs took over
Nancy and the children and Graves took Riding over to the mountain
village of Deya, Mallorca.
Graves wanted to break free from his past as he clearly indicated by
calling his autobiography Goodbye to All That (1929). Alas, his new life
with Riding was as traumatic as the troubles he had endured as a
shell-shocked soldier in the First World War. Riding and Graves parted
in 1939 because she decided to marry another man, Schuyler Jackson.
Graves married Beryl Pritchard in 1950 but never forgot what Martin
Seymour-Smith calls the ''nightmare'' of the Riding years. Even when
suffering from memory-loss in old age (he died of Alzheimer's disease in
1985) he talked about Riding.
When Seymour-Smith's biography first appeared in 1982, Riding was
still alive and kicking. Appalled at the description of herself as
''explosively freakish'' she issued a statement savaging a poet
Seymour-Smith portrayed as ''a good and generous man'' manipulated by a
monster: Graves ''had all the agility of a moral cripple with a talent
for achieving the appearance of a moral normal . . . he could only
function dishonestly; he was more of animal than human nature -- a being
of freakish exceptionality in borrowed human identity''.
Before she died in 1991 Riding regularly denounced those who referred
critically to her relationship with Graves (I was taken to task at least
twice for so doing). Now she is no more Seymour-Smith has revised his
biography and intensified his attack on Riding. She was ''a female
monster'', a ''sadist and bully'', a woman of ''monstrousness and
undoubted cruelty''. And so on.
If Riding was what Seymour-Smith says she was what does that make the
man who thought himself lucky to share 13 years of his life with her? It
makes him a masochist in Seymour-Smith's book: ''Graves felt he needed
pain so that he might, in the phrase his ferocious mother often used to
him and to his brothers and sisters, remain pure''. This interpretation
helps explain Graves's love poetry which is sexually submissive and
stylistically pure. Riding brought out the best, not the beast, in him
and he acknowledged as much in 1946. Riding, he reckoned, was
''possessed for a great many years by a very cruel and beautiful Muse
with which she identified herself . . . I stand still greatly in her
debt''.
Seymour-Smith, who knew Graves well, offers an impressive and
authoritative account of an eccentric who happened to be a fine poet.
Not the finest English-language poet of the century, as Seymour-Smith
claims, but a man who brought lyrical meaning to moonshine (Riding,
Graves observed, always ''glowed with a sort of light''). Graves was an
anachronism -- an astrologer in an age of astronomy, a poet conservative
in a time of revolutionary poetic change -- yet Seymour-Smith rightly
salutes him for soldiering on with a new life after being officially
declared dead when hit by a shell at the Somme in 1916. Seymour-Smith
honours his hero in grand style.
When he was not expressing his creative vitality in poems and novels,
old soldier Graves was a combative critic who looked on the history of
poetry as a metrical march with everyone out of step but Hardy and
himself and Riding, his militant Muse. So much can be gathered from
Collected Writings on Poetry. Burns was banal -- ''an authentic
ploughman and ribald satirist of low life'' who, when he aimed at an
elevated effect, ''could not quite manage it''. Blake was bonkers and
got into a ''poetic muddle'' when taking on ''The Tyger''. Coleridge was
crazy, unable to cope with the pressure of measuring up to the Muse.
As for experimental poets of the twentieth century, Yeats missed out
on the Muse because ''he had nothing to say''. Pound produced
''ignorant, indecent, unmelodious, seldom metrical Cantos''. Eliot was
an ex-banker ''Pound-foolish'' enough to write lines that amounted to
''poetic bankruptcy''. Auden's best lines were borrowed from Riding.
Dylan Thomas had sensuality but no sense.
For Graves, only the Muse mattered and he submits to the White Goddess
in his essays and lectures. He wrote to me in 1972: ''All I am
interested in is whether the poems I write are acceptable to the woman
for whom I wrote them''. He was forever musing about Riding.
Better to think of Graves as a muse-struck poet than to see him as the
sad old man movingly remembered in Wild Olives (Hutchinson, #18.99) by
his son, William, who watched him decline in Deya: ''It was tragic to
see the terror in his eyes as he tried to run away, supported by his
nurse and a walking-stick, from the ghosts of the Somme''. As his
father's literary executor, William Graves has helped organise the
Robert Graves centenary celebrations which take place in Mallorca and
Britain from July to the end of this year and these will do credit to
his creativity.
* A selection of Robert Graves's best poems -- The Centenary Selected
Poems by Robert Graves -- was published last month by Carcanet Press,
Manchester, at #15.95.

BAD WHISKY; Edward Burns; Balvag Books; #9.99
IT WAS but a month or two back that did I not find myself in Ireland
and was there not illicit whisky, spelled nobody quite knows in this
office because I asked them: we think it is poteen. Distilled the once,
it contains natural poisons and is not very good for you first thing in
the morning, but dreadfully nice at night. Poteen is bad whisky but not
really, for it is the barley bree and quite natural.
As Edward Burns's new book, It's a Bad Thing Whisky, Especially BAD
WHISKY -- that's the title -- states, bad whisky can be very bad indeed
and harmless potions from Donegal areney in it.
This book worries you. The adulteration of food and drink in the late
nineteenth century, which is what this scholarly book deals with, was
breathtaking. Arsenical and strychnine preparations were commonplace in
every element of produce in the mid to late Victorian ages. Opiates were
everywhere.
The scale of poison in the nineteenth century knew no bounds, and
whisky was no exception to this element of commerce. For commerce read
profit.
The truth is that the whisky industry is very lucky to have survived,
for Scotch whisky was, in the late days of Victoriana, another word for
early death: it was not aqua vitae at all. Whisky, before it was
regulated in the early 1900s, was often mixed with methyl alcohol and
other chemicals. Sometimes they were relatively harmless (for many years
whisky was adulterated with water from sewers, prune juice, burnt sugar,
sulphuric acid, take your pick); sometimes whisky was capable of
blinding or causing a quick and agonising demise.
Rarely was it the fault of the distillers or brewers, usually the
publicans themselves, squeezed both by temperance-orientated magistrates
and rapacious whisky magnates. Fortunes were made out of publicans and
customers alike, and neither were the better for it. Fortunately whisky
has survived a lot longer than its Victorian customers did.
BAD WHISKY is a hard book to read, but console yourselves. Now, today,
believe me, there is no such thing as a bad Scotch. Read the book and
find out why that is. Slainte mhath.

IN THE improvised variety show that is resembled by Scottie McClue's
Nightline, a new phenomonen in Scottish broadcasting, it is not always
clear who is playing the feed and who the comic. If there is a goat
around, it is unclear whose is being got, or who is acting it. For three
hours every weekday night it produces a patter in which the caller is
the potential victim risking an immediate cut-off, the accessory to a
routine where there is a strong element of collusion and double-bluff,
the confidant seeking advice and sympathy, the family friend phoning up
for a blether, or the latest challenger in a gladiatorial contest of
abuse. All comers are accepted, but who is coming it?
The listening audience can never predict what will trigger Scottie's
ruthlessness or his indulgence, and neither can he. This lends every
exchange its fascinating tension, and a cult following. The only fast
rules are: no surnames or names of businesses, a libel precaution. No
politics, sport or religion. No profanity, though variations are
permitted on Scottie's own derivatives of ''a load of shecht'' and
''taking the pash''. These, along with catchword excavations like
''dinky-doo'', a ''wee chiff-chaff'' and ''the old heave-ho'', lend a
tone that is simultaneously homely, abrasive, and eccentric.
There is ample scope for manoeuvre, but anything deemed unacceptably
offensive is caught by the three-second delay. Receiving his unvetted
calls, Scottie plays a role between the late James Sanderson and Pa
Broon, with paradoxical bits of the avuncular counsellor, the DSS
inspector, and the bar-stool wind-up merchant thrown in. It is quite a
performance, but he admits to being a Gemini with everything that might
imply about personality splits, and he is clearly an accomplished mimic.
Yet a moral framework emerges night after night, if you can separate
Scottie's formulaic provocations against women drivers and single
parents from his arguments for education as an essential part of prison
rehabilitation of violent offenders. He can talk about the ''sanctity of
human values'' and dismiss a caller as ''Mr Plinkety Plonk'',
castigating his ''limited brainpower''. ''Scottie McClue is not against
people,'' he corrects another. ''Scottie McClue's for making people
think.''
He punctures mental complacency, yet he promotes an anodyne world of
good pots of soup and getting into your jammies to say goodnight. He
sometimes seems to be broadcasting for a forgotten era of steam
wirelesses by the firesides. There is nothing said on the programme that
might not be heard round ''your average Scottish family table'', he
likes to think, and it is with familiarity rather than a
presidential-style megalomania that he regularly addresses ''The
Nation''. ''You're letting The Nation down,'' he chastens, like a
scandalised auntie. ''Apologise to The Nation.'' It is a game played
like a chatline revival of windae hingin'.
Ellen!
Hello, Scottie.
Hello, Ellen.
Is that you, Scottie?
It's me, it's Scottie McClue on Scot FM, darling.
Well, Scottie, I was wondering . . . I've got a wee bit of a problem.
Oh, you certainly have.
Aye, know what it is? I've got a very large bust size and see when I'm
walking out, people are slagging me.
You've got a great big top storey wi' a coupla swingers?
But, Scottie, when I'm walking out the street everybody's slagging me.
I don't even want to go out.
What size are your dibblers?
Fifty.
Fifties?
Aye.
And what size is the rest of you? What size is your waist?
About a forty.
A forty?
Aye. And I've got a Black Forest gateau.
You've got a what? A what've you got?
A Black Forest gateau.
Your Man From Uncle badge's on the dark side?
Aye.
Tell me, d'you find yourself leaning forward in a wind?
Aye, so I do.
When you do a press-up, you're maybe going forward only two or three
inches?
Aye.
If you turned round quickly could you get done for assault?
No. I'd get done for murder.
Well, try and keep upright. Cheerie bye.
Cheerie bye, Scottie.
This is the 86th call of a midweek night, and the quick-witted pun on
''upright'' is an almost Shakespearian touch of instinctive genius,
playing to both pit and gallery. The multi-faceted Scottie is working
through the list of callers that scrolls on his screen, like incoming
flights on an airport monitor, at the average rate of less than one a
minute, at least half terminating within three seconds. We have had June
complaining about rude shop assistants, Bert celebrating the Jowett
Javeline and the Austin ''Ruby'', Isobel disclosing her husband's affair
with her best friend, Leslie followed by John launching an attack on
Scottie as a ''parasite in the bosom of society'', David from
Bonnybridge on his experiences of playing golf on Mars, Allie's case for
keeping Sunday ''special'', Mary from Kilmarnock's condemnation of
commercial whaling, and the audition of Kirsty and John. They want an
argument settled. Which one of them is singing out of tune? They take
turns to sing ''Wheels On Fire''. ''You're both as tone deaf as an old
budgerigar, darling,'' Scottie adjudicates, accurately.
Through the the rest of the programme Scottie will advise Chelsea that
her guilt over a sexual experiment with a female friend is unnecessary,
console another Isabel over a relative lost to cancer and offer a cuddle
from ''Uncle Scottie''. He will do impersonations of Parker from
Thunderbirds because Gemmy sounds like Lady Penelope, and asks Meg if
she's tried wearing her partner's Ys when she expresses revulsion over
his cross-dressing. He is a master of deadpan. John complains that he
was out in Sarajevo last February and the ''media's got it out of all
proportion -- it's just like anywhere else''. ''That's very encouraging,
John.''
My interview was scheduled for the next afternoon, and it was a point
of no little curiosity as to which of these multiple-personalities I
would be meeting. I had been making extensive inquiries about a Colin
Lamont, the name under which I had reason to believe Scottie had led
much of his earlier life. I had followed the career into radio at Red
Rose Gold in Preston of a man who had bemused viewers of three
television stations with unscripted asides and leers as a continuity
presenter and newsreader, who had spent four years as Director of
Education Programmes with Scottish Opera and taught at school and
college, who had won the Duncan Macrae Award as a final year student at
the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, but who had reached the
early management stage after a traineeship in a bank, his first job on
leaving school in Partick. Would all of these Scotties be able to turn
up at the same time?
He will be late, I had been warned by Scot FM managing director Tom
Hunter, but he will have a very good excuse. In the event, I was late
and Scottie was reported to be walking the dog down at Leith Docks.
Eventually, he arrived at the car-park outside the radio station in
cloth bonnet, quilted sleeveless bodywarmer, corduroys, and heavy
brogues. This, the ruddy expression, the generous girth and the Range
Rover (behind the wheel of which the dog took up position), more than
suggested the appearance of a Perthshire farmer. Except he grinned too
much, and there were lucky gaps between his teeth.
His voice was a modified version of the one he uses on air. This
Scottie looked and sounded in his early forties. The other one chortles
and rasps into the microphone as though he has anything up to another
three decades as an excuse for an imminent retreat towards gaga. No such
disposition in the presence which confronted me, but not much
recognition of himself either. ''Colin Lamont?'' he shook his head,
having earlier claimed a photographic memory. ''Doesn't ring any bells.
If there is such a character, I'm sure he's not as interesting as
Scottie McClue.'' On the other hand, he talks of Scottie in the third
person.
''There's a great warmth about Scottie,'' he says with affection.
''He's not a cold character. He's very immersed in Scottish character.
There's a lot of harmless stuff comes out of Scottie, not making great
statements, but light entertainment. There's not enough people who
entertain us.
''There's a touch of the strip-the-willow mentality in him. You know,
when your partner spins out of control into a wall and you say 'See you'
and move up the line. I think Scottie does a few strip-the-willows, if
people are fit enough and able enough. If they're not, a mild two-step.
I love that feeling of just letting people go in the middle of a dance
with the mad music going. And off they spin.''
He was suspended for a couple of weeks in Preston, before his
Liverpool cable listeners started to phone up protesting: ''I know he
slags us off, but give's him back.'' Scottie's boss, John Myers, now of
Century Radio in Gateshead, then set his protege a required quota of at
least half a dozen listeners' complaints a day, otherwise the show
wasn't working. He had started Scottie out with the briefing, ''You're
an argumentative bastard, go on air and give them hell.'' It was
Scottie's first radio show, and its audience had increased tenfold. It
was also Myers who gave him the name Scottie McClue, from an ABC
children's compere remembered from his Carlisle boyhood.
The day Scottie McClue phoned up for a job at Scot FM is believed to
be the time the new radio station was saved. It had been struggling
until Scottie's huge following coincided with a weekly reach up from 8%
to 13% of the Scottish Central Belt radio audience. The show finds rave
approval from an unexpectedly wide spectrum of people. They might not be
phoning up, but they are listening. It has been hailed as the first
genuinely open-access airtime in Scottish radio, giving voice to a
constituency usually ignored or patronised by talking down.
The point has been well made that you could learn more about the
preoccupations, fears, and prejudices of the vast majority of Scottish
people by listening to three hours of Scottie McClue's Nightline than
any number of constitutional debates, panel chatterings, or presenters
displaying their erudition on the BBC. Depending on how you hear him,
Scottie McClue is a poultice drawing unhealthy opinion to the surface,
or he is the first People's Jock on Scottish radio.
''My greatest sales medium is the word of mouth,'' reflects Scottie.
''It's the threes syndrome. Two guys in a pub, and one says 'I think
he's a thick, ignorant shite'. The other one says, 'I don't think so at
all. He's very clever, actually'. The third one says, 'Who are you two
talking about?'''

Sgt Alan Perrin is a man on a mission to reach the summit of an
Alaskan mountain. He is also paralysed and partially blind. Julia
Langdon reports on the brave dream.
IT IS called, with graphic simplicity, the ''Unseen Steps''
expedition. The aim, as set out formally in the sponsorship prospectus,
is simply stated. It is: ''To support Sgt Alan Perrin, who is paralysed
throughout the left-hand side of his body and partially sighted, to the
top of Mount McKinley (20,320 ft), Alaska, by the West Buttress route.''
Nothing about the rest of this story is simple, in any way.
We are dealing here with a collection of people who appear to the rest
of us to be extraordinarily brave, probably foolhardy, and absolutely
barmy. They are the sort of people who make those of us struggling along
life's path facing all the ordinary humdrum challenges strewn before us
feel rather small. But they are also immensely cheering, decent people
embarking upon a bizarre project to raise money for two charities and
cast, as they clearly are, in the treasured mould of Great British
eccentricity.
At the centre of events are two young men, Dominic Marshall and Edward
de la Billiere -- who are, sort of incidentally, sitting their final law
exams as solicitors before they set off on this madcap venture -- and a
former Royal Marine who received such devastating injuries in the
accidental blast of a hand-grenade that, as well as being blinded in one
eye and only peripherally sighted in the other, he was told he would
never walk again. That was in September 1992.
And then there is Mount McKinley, the highest peak in North America,
200 miles outside the Arctic Circle and reputedly the coldest mountain
in the world. ''The challenge of the mountain,'' says the prospectus,
''lies in the extreme cold and exaggerated altitude effects.'' The route
they have chosen is 17 miles long, involves an ascent of 13,000ft and
will take an estimated five weeks.
Sergeant Perrin, known affectionately as Reg, had been an Arctic
survival instructor for 14 years before his accident. Over the years he
had done seven three-month tours in Norway, instructing military
personnel in such matters as how to build snow-holes, how to ski, how to
survive, indeed; something that will be very much on all their minds on
the mountain. On September 21, 1992, he was training Naval officers in
grenade throwing and his unit was preparing to deploy to Bosnia. He took
the blast on his head.
He is not only remarkably unembittered, he delights in a rather black
humour about his injuries, joking, for example, about how he cuts a
swathe through crowded pavements with his white stick and how he would
prefer to have a hook to replace his useless arm as it would save money
hiring costumes for fancy-dress parties. It may be defensive, but he is
obviously a man of exceptional courage. ''It was one of those things,''
he says. ''I've no grudge against the Services at all. It could have
happened crossing the road -- but I wouldn't have been so well looked
after.''
This is where one of the charities comes in. Dominic's father, Major
Peter Marshall, works for St Dunstan's, the charity founded in the First
World War to care for those blinded in military action. It now looks
after blinded service people and Major Marshall helped Sgt Perrin, who
is 31, sort out all the problems, practical and bureaucratic, involved
with being medically discharged in his circumstances. ''I was literally
stumbling about life until St Dunstan's found me,'' the wounded marine
said. The expedition will cost #20,000, and the team plans to raise
#100,000 for St Dunstan's and the British Sports Association for the
Disabled.
It was Major Marshall who suggested to Dominic and his friend Edward,
who were planning a mountaineering trip after their finals, that they
might care to include ''Reg''. It was a project they have
enthusiastically accepted. When we met they had all just been on Blue
Peter and are all rather excited. All three of them, the loose-limbed
able-bodied young men and Sgt Perrin, too, have the strong firm
handshakes of bold men.
The two 25-year-old friends have considerable experience in climbing
and exploring and they have recruited a team of 10. The others include
John Barry, a mountaineer and climbing expert; two doctors who will
study the effects of the combination of altitude and physical exertion
on Sgt Perrin -- who has been passed as medically fit for the expedition
by his neurologist -- and will then publish a paper on their findings;
and a mountaineering artist who has climbed Everest. The others are
load-carrying friends.
For most of the past year they have been training -- partly in the
Cairngorms -- preparing and fund-raising. On June 10 they let for
Anchorage to then be flown on to the Kahiltna Glacier to establish base
camp. There will then be ferrying parties to move stores and equipment
to various heights, while ''Reg'' rests, and then they will make their
summit bid.
''It's a true team,'' says Sgt Perrin. ''The whole team is really
designed to put me on the summit. If they're not in the right place at
the right time they won't make it.''
''Every mountaineer has to be prepared for failure,'' says Edward.
''We'll have had a success if we just make two or three camps,'' says
Sgt Perrin. ''For someone who was told he would never walk again . . . I
was told I was going to be a violent vegetable and live in a
wheelchair.''
He calls them, with reciprocal affection to their nickname for him,
''the lads''. It is the lads who will have to help him do everything on
the mountain -- he can't tie laces. It is the lads who will have to feed
him and dress him and keep him warm, who will have his life in their
hands. He is not frightened. He has no fear of personal injury. ''My
only fear is letting the lads down in being unable to make it.''
The outcome, whether they do make it, will be recorded by the BBC.
With the help of the indomitable broadcaster, Kate Adie, a 50-minute
film of their mission is due to be broadcast by the QED programme on
BBC1 on August 17 (at 10pm). A team of seven, of whom three are
mountaineers equipped for the final assault, will be involved in filming
the whole brave venture, those Unseen Steps.
They josh each other, gently, tenderly, bravely. ''It's a walk in the
snow,'' says Sgt Perrin. A walk in the snow up to 20,320 feet, at
temperatures of between minus 40 degrees and minus 60 degrees where
every blast of wind will subtract another degree in temperature.

AT the age of 17 in 1991, Deborah Alexander found herself in the big
industrial city of Semarang on the north coast of Java. With a group
around her, she was about to start teaching conversational English to
students in an Islamic College. ''I was nervous about that first time,''
she said, ''but when you've done it once and it has gone well, you get
your confidence.''
Four years later, after her time in Java and a degree at the
University of East Anglia, Deborah Alexander has now returned to the
Project Trust's Hebridean Centre in Coll, where she first trained for
her Indonesian adventure. On June 29 this year, she will be one of the
people Prince Charles will meet when he arrives for a visit to Coll.
The aim of the trust is to get young people doing things and living in
places they might never have thought of themselves, and, in the
1995-1996 year, the trust expects to send its 3000th volunteer to one of
23 countries as far apart as Chile and Jordan, Uganda and China. Along
with 213 volunteers, he or she could work with various organisations,
tackling tasks as varied as teaching English to all ages, working in
homes for disabled people and in hospitals, or getting down to it in
remote development projects. But in all cases, the year away is deeply
involved in the life and people of the country.
The founder of the trust, Major Nicholas MacLean-Bristol, believes
that, though more young people are travelling overseas than ever before,
a holiday, or simply wandering from one country to another, gives them
no more than a superficial impression of other cultures. Earlier
generations, from a time when Britain was deeply involved in every
continent and many spent most of their working lives overseas, really
understood the world outside Europe.
''My aim is to educate a new generation of Britons in what goes on in
other countries,'' MacLean-Bristol said. ''To do that it is essential to
capture the imagination of that generation.'' At the same time, the
youngsters certainly earn their keep with useful work for the countries.
While he was serving in places such as Borneo, Malaya, and Aden with
the King's Own Scottish Borderers, Major MacLean-Bristol became
interested in overseas development work and sent his first volunteer to
Ethiopia in 1967. Under the influence of Lieutenant-General Sir Derek
Lang, now the trust's patron, the army then gave him two years to set up
Project Trust. He worked from London and planned projects in South
America. That done, MacLean-Bristol left the army early. He flung
himself into the expansion of the trust on Coll, with his wife, Lavinia,
as administrator, first at their home, Breacachadh Castle, Coll, which
they had restored.
As one would expect from a military man, the Project Trust is well
organised , and MacLean-Bristol is adept at keeping the interest, not
just of ''returned volunteers'', as they are called, but of parents and
friends. Many of the 13 staff at the centre are returned volunteers, but
many parents act as trust representatives in areas of Britain, as do
former sponsors, who have helped young volunteers raise the formidable
sum of #2950 for their year away. For the volunteers, this is not just a
contribution over the year but also something of an initiative test to
give confidence to people still in their final year at school.
Their year-out starts with selection courses in Coll in October,
November, and December. They spend a week living with local people, to
help in island life. Some 64% come from local authority education, the
remainder from private schools. Though Scottish numbers are growing,
volunteers are still largely from the rest of Britain and, therefore,
are meeting a very different culture from their own. By learning about
it, MacLean-Bristol hopes that they will gain an insight for the year
away. ''I want them to think not just about what goes on, but why,''
MacLean-Bristol said. ''To get them to use their brains.'' Of the 286
who came for selection this year, 213 have been accepted. As much as
anything else, the assessment is one of fitting people to jobs and
countries.
After that it is a question of going back to school for Highers or
A-levels and, at the same time, a deal of fund-raising. Exams over and
school finished, they return in batches to Coll in July and August for a
10-day training course aimed at fitting each volunteer to a particular
job in a particular country. Then, in September, they're off, usually in
couples for each placement, with a dozen or more in one country.
''We've three new countries this year -- Vietnam, Malaysia, and
Guyana,'' MacLean-Bristol said. ''And Cuba which came in in 1993 is very
exciting, with everything changing.'' It is a popular choice just now.
Jobs vary enormously, and can bring a surprise or two. Moya Simpson,
from Somerset, went to Thailand to work for a non-governmental
organisation in a rural centre, doing everything fron teaching English
to practical farming. But this was 1991, at the height of the
Aids-awareness campaigns, and at one point she found herself dressed up
as a green condom in Bangkok as part of a local campaign. ''What happens
to us in that year! I don't think my parents knew what I was letting
myself in for,'' she laughed. ''But it was a wonderful time and changed
me completely.''
Most parents are strong supporters and continue to help in any way
they can. Yet there must be parental doubts. ''Many of the parents have
not travelled a lot, and they are grateful for the chance for their
children,'' MacLean-Bristol said. ''But we have to be very open about
what can go wrong. ''So far, the worst problems have been a nervous
breakdown in India and overwork in Thailand, and the nightmare of a
couple of car crashes. Though there has been nothing too devastating,
the staff cross their fingers as they say that, and there are always
emergency numbers on the answer-phone.
During their year, all the volunteers are visited by a staff member.
For all, there can never be a rest from fund-raising. Each year, the
Project Trust in all its aspects takes some #750,000 to run, and
receives no government grant. The former Highlands and Islands
Development Board did contribute #50,000 to converting the present
centre from an old farmhouse to a residential centre. Now it houses
volunteers and, to make money for the trust, other groups when it is
free.
Not all trust staff are returned volunteers. Karen Taylor has an
agricultural degree and met her future husband at Sourhope Hill Research
Station in Yetholm in the Borders before they moved to Coll. Ten years
later she joined the trust, to co-ordinate the centre, and to look after
Zimbabwe and Namibia, where a farming background is of great value.
''It's particularly useful in making contact with people in a rural
country such as Namibia,'' she said. ''You've something in common right
away.''
The volunteers come back to Coll for a ''debriefing'' -- Major
MacLean-Bristol's military background can reveal itself in the trust
vocabulary -- to compare notes and discuss their very different
experiences. Included while they are overseas is a commitment to write
an analysis of the country as a whole, its economy, its future, and the
people with whom they have lived and worked. ''Some of them are
remarkable in the way they have analysed their countries and people,''
MacLean-Bristol said.
But the most important thing for him is to see how the volunteers have
matured in confidence and judgment . . . even the final party can be a
fascinating revelation. Each volunteer wears the costume of the country
they have worked in, and many see their beds but briefly in three days.
''I look at some quiet little person we sent out to, say, Brazil, and
I think 'What have we done?' because she's up on her feet at that final
party doing the lambada!''

IT HAS been a relatively quiet week all round and fast approaching the
time of year when most of the spring migrants have passed through or
dispersed. New arrivals included a Pine Bunting in Orkney, Surf Scoter
in Shetland and elsewhere Mediterranean Gulls were reported from several
locations.
Reports are listed in approximate order of rarity or interest of the
species, giving dates seen.
Unfortunately no guarantees can be given that the birds will still be
present at this time.

found on North Ronaldsay, Orkney and was seen at least until the 18th.
GRAMPIAN -- At the RSPB Starnafin Farm reserve a Ruddy Shelduck, three
Black-Tailed Godwits, one Greenshank and a Little Gull were all seen
(17th), and nearby, two Wood Sandpipers near Lossiemouth and the Drake
King Eider and Forsters Tern still on the Ythan Estuary (17th).
SHETLAND -- The two Drake King Eiders remain on Tresta Voe and a
Common Rosefinch along with the Black-Browed Albatross were still on
Unst. Also on Shetland a Red-Backed Shrike, Terek Sandpiper, Beeater and

IF the ringed plover is likely to be your companion on beach picnics,
then the common sandpiper will probably distract you from the egg
sandwiches if you have stopped by water, still or moving, in the
Highlands. Maybe the wavering quadrosyllabic trill would remind you of
those summer minutes at lochside lay-bys or bridges over border burns.
Look for the origin of the sound and you will see a little, dapper
bird, white below and warm brown above, bobbing its head on a stone by
the shore or flicking across the water on tightly bowed wings, a whirr
and a glide just inches from the surface.
Common sandpipers come in from Africa in early May and their breeding
distribution follows precisely the Highland line. You will not see
flocks, just individuals and pairs to tell you summer days are here
again. By early August they are on the move again. It is the insects
they come to us for, not midges, unfortunately but water beetles, caddis
flies, mayflies, and perhaps a few tadpoles and freshwater snails.
The folk names are all to do with that unmistakeable summertime call,
except for ''summer snipe'', widespread and simple definition. In
Aberdeen it is called the ''Heather-peeper'', in Orkney
''Waterypleeps'', in Kirkcudbright ''Kittie Needie'' and in East Lothian
''Killieleepsie''. Then of course it is ''Willy Wicket'' in the north of
England. Take your pick. Common sandpipers all make the same noise; it
is our ears which vary from place to place.

The minimum stipend for Church of Scotland ministers will increase to
#15,348 in January 1996 in line with the rate of inflation.
Forty per cent of the Kirk's 1250 ministers are on the minimum stipend
and will benefit from the increase, agreed by the church's General
Assembly in May. Ministers with five years' service will receive a
supplementary #833, while churchmen with six or more will get #1666. All
ministers are expected to receive an increase of at least #504.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang yesterday called on the insurance industry
to take a greater role in crime prevention.
Despite his absence in London on other business, Mr Lang made a
serious impact on the CBI Crime Risk Management seminar in Glasgow.
His keynote address to Scottish business leaders concerned with
containing the enormous cost of crime was read by Mr Duncan McNiven, the
civil servant heading the police division of the Scottish Office.
''Insurers have the ability, because of the financial levers they can
apply, to persuade businesses to reduce their crime risks,'' Mr Lang's
speech said. ''This gives them more power in this respect than the
police, who frequently conduct surveys and make recommendations which
are not followed up by those to whom they are addressed.
''I would like to encourage the insurance industry to take a more
proactive approach and look at how they can increase their involvement
in criminal research and crime prevention.''
Earlier in the speech, he fired a salvo at local authorities whose
areas could lose out because of high crime.
''Business crime also has a cost to the community. Areas with high
crime rates are less attractive to inward investment,'' Mr Lang warned.
''Progressive companies increasingly examine the crime profile of an
area before deciding to locate and invest.''

A STURDY rope and the strength of a friend saved the life of a climber
who fell 40ft down a mountain in the Cuillins on Skye on Thursday night.
The injured climber, library assistant Michael Guest, 48, of Perton in
Wolverhampton,told police his arms gave out as he attempted his third
climb of the day and he fell, only to have his fall broken by his rope.
He said that he had cracked his head against the rock face but his
helmet prevented any injury.
His companion, Mr David Bradshaw of Lath, Lincolnshire, took over,
hauling Mr Guest to the summit before setting off for help.
Both men were camping in Glenbrittle, using a tent as a base for their
climbing holiday. They were taking advantage of the long summer nights
to get in as much climbing as they could on the Cuillins, a popular
venue for summer climbers.
The accident happened at around 10pm, as the pair were making an
ascent of a 2500ft high rock face called Integrity. They were only 40ft
short of the summit when Mr Guest slipped and fell about 50ft. The fact
that he was roped to his companion prevented him from plunging 1000ft.
Mr Guest injured his back and hip as he banged against the rock face
and his climbing partner had to carry on alone to the top.
After hauling Mr Guest to the summit, Mr Bradshaw made him comfortable
in a bivouac bag and set off to raise the alarm.
However, because of low cloud and mist, he took more than four hours
to reach a phone and alert Skye mountain rescue team.
Skye MRT leader Gerry Ackroyd said: ''They were well-equipped and
experienced climbers. The fact they had followed the rules and were
roped together saved the man's life. Otherwise he could have bounced
down another 1000ft.
''His friend did well to pull his companion to the top, because he was
a big lad. Then he navigated himself off the mountain in very poor
visibility. We called out a helicopter and there was a brief break in
the low cloud which allowed the aircraft to nip in and uplift the
casualty.''
Mr Guest was taken to Broadford hospital but refused permission for a
condition report to be released. It is believed he is not seriously
injured.

A SENIOR Scottish academic warned yesterday that assessment of quality
and standards in higher education teaching was here to stay.
Professor John Arbuthnott, Principal and vice chancellor of
Strathclyde University, told a forum in Edinburgh that while quality and
standards in the profession had been the subject of much controversy,
the system would remain.
He added: ''It is essential to establish what could be reasonably
expected. Quality assessment can assist and help the ethos of good
practice.''
Addressing the first annual forum of the Committee of Scottish Higher
Education Principals, Professor Arbuthnott said there were undoubtedly
challenges ahead on the assessment issue but that bureaucracy had to
respect professionalisation.
''We expect our staff to be independent thinkers but quality
assessment carried out in this way has distinct advantages. I have
little doubt that in five years from now this process will be honed,''
he said.
Referring to the funding system in education in Scotland, he added
that this was now a reality of life.
Government constraints, he suggested, had to be addressed.
He explained: ''The current round of cuts must be a concern for
funding councils. The higher education sector does not expect a blank
cheque but private-sector income is now being sought.
''I think it is time the notion that higher education is a drain on
the Scottish economy was dispelled.''
Professor Maxwell Irvine, Principal and vice chancellor of Aberdeen
University, added that a dynamic recruiting programme was required to
seek new funding to sustain the high level of education.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair has moved swiftly to heal the rift with the
largest Labour affiliate after his preferred candidate failed to oust
Transport and General Workers union general secretary Bill Morris.
Mr Morris's bold move in putting his job on the line a year early paid
handsome dividends yesterday when it was revealed that he had trounced
main challenger Jack Dromey by a decisive 159,000 votes to 100,000 to
retain the general secretaryship. Kent tractor driver Norman Dividson
received 16,000 votes.
It also emerged yesterday that, contrary to earlier indications from
his office, Mr Blair may now accept an invitation to address the TGWU's
biennial conference in two weeks' time.
Previously, Mr Blair has spoken only at the conferences of staunchly
''loyalist'' unions and had appeared unwilling to address the TGWU, his
own sponsoring union, because it was seen as the focus of opposition to
modernising moves, including the introduction of one-member-one-vote and
the ditching of Clause 4.
If he does attend the Blackpool conference, and his office said
yesterday it had still to be confirmed as diaries were still being
studied, Mr Blair is expected to use the opportunity to try to defuse
the simmering row over the proposed introduction of a national minimum
wage which otherwise threatens to come to the boil at the October party
conference. He may also hope to influence forthcoming elections for
TGWU's lay executive committee.
Labour is keen to defer consideration of the level at which a national
minimum should be set, while the TGWU and several other key unions want
a commitment to #4 an hour or more.
Mr Dromey, husband of Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman, said
he had ''no regrets'' about standing and stressed that the 100,000 votes
he received indicated the level of unease within the union.
Congratulating Mr Morris on his victory, he said he hoped the general
secretary would take notice of the ''clear message'' from those who
voted against him in such large numbers.
''There is a mood for change in the T&amp;G just as there is a mood for
change in the country. A new T&amp;G is emerging and this election has
brought a breath of fresh air blowing through the union.''
''Members have said that, from now on, the leadership must listen to
their views, not tell them what they think,'' he said.
Mr Dromey, who at 46 is 10 years younger than Mr Morris, intends to
hang on in at the TGWU with a view to getting the top job eventually.
He said he would be back at his desk on Monday morning continuing in
his job as head of the union's public services section, which he saw as
a vocation not just a job.
Mr Morris, who will not need to face re-election again in his eight
years to retirement, said he regarded the result as an endorsement of
his ''positive plans'' for the future.
He pledged to continue campaigning for a national minimum wage of at
least #4 an hour, even though the Labour leadership wants to delay
setting a figure until after the next election.
Attention will now focus on the forthcoming TGWU biennial conference
followed by the executive elections towards the end of the year which
will decide whether the largest Labour affiliate retains its old Labour
traditions or swings behind Tony Blair's modernising crusade for ''New
Labour''.
The 32-strong lay executive is very much old Labour at present but
with all jobs up for re-election and about a third of the seats vacant,
mainly for reasons of retirement or death, there is clear scope for a
mood of change to present itself if one exists.

EIGHT pupils, a teacher, and a school administrator have been sent
home with breathing difficulties from a Stirlingshire primary school
next to a crop of oil-seed rape.
Experts from the Health and Safety Executive and council environmental
health officials yesterday were investigating the theory that the crop
-- growing in a field up to the playground fence -- is to blame.
Education authority officials may decide on Monday whether the school,
Cornton Vale Primary near Stirling, should close early for the summer
holidays.
At least one pupil was taken to Stirling Royal Infirmary suffering
from breathing difficulties. Others were treated by local doctors.
A Central Regional Council spokeswoman said: ''The children's symptoms
seem to be runny eyes, redness, and spots under the eyes. Some of the
children have breathing difficulties.
''Six children went home on Wednesday, four are still ill, two more
have been sent home since then, and, after the school sports day on
Thursday, a teacher and an administrative member of staff went home
feeling lousy from it.
''The early indications are that its certainly something that's
airborne.
''We're monitoring the situation. Closure of the school is not an
option at the moment but we're listening to the experts and we'll follow
their advice.
''We also want to see if the problem goes away when the weather
changes, which it may do after the weekend.''
Scientists at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, confirmed earlier this week
that exposure to oil-seed rape causes sneezing, coughing, headaches, and
eye irritation in otherwise healthy individuals.
The agricultural industry has dismissed complaints against the crop as
''hysteria''.
Ms Kimberley McPhee, 22, of Lomond Cresent, Cornton, whose
five-year-old son Scott was affected, said: ''His eyes were red and
swollen and he was screaming and wheezing, saying he couldn't breathe. I
took him to the doctor's the next day.''
Her mother, Mrs Mary Petrie, 57, whose home overlooks the oil-seed
rape field, said: ''There was a fine mist over the field, a fine film of
white dust, and my front windows were pure white. I couldn't get them
clean.''
A spokesman for Stirling District Council said: ''Oil-seed rape is a
legitimate crop and there's not much we can do.
''It's a rotational crop and it wasn't in that field last year, which
may be why they didn't notice any problems last year.''
Dr Andrew Riley, Forth Valley Health Board's consultant in public
health medicine, said: ''It's too early to have any information on what
may have caused the children's symptoms but we are investigating and
monitoring the situation closely.''

A SOLICITOR was released uninjured yesterday after police stormed an
interview room at a magistrates' court and seized a man accused of two
murders.
Mr Alistair Harper had been held at Lancaster for 21 hours before he
was released just before 10am when specially trained officers rushed
into the basement room and overpowered Mr Terrence Clifton.
Superintendent Ivan Howarth told a news conference outside the court:
''It was always our strategy to negotiate a peaceful release. That was
the way it was going to go until the situation became very delicate. We
decided it was appropriate to take another form of action. We put in a
specially trained unit of three men to effect Mr Harper's release.
''He has been released and he has no injuries. But he is obviously
very shaken. He has had a horrendous time in there.''
Mr Howarth said the three officers who stormed the interview room were
members of the Operation Support Unit. They had not been armed but were
trained in ''rapid entry'' techniques.
Mr Clifton, of no fixed address, was not believed to have been badly
injured apart from being winded. Mr Howarth said Mr Clifton was believed
to have been armed with three ''weapons'' -- a pen, a radio aerial, and
a sharp metal instrument.
''An inquiry is under way to see how he got hold of them,'' he said.
The drama began shortly after 1pm on Thursday when Mr Clifton, who is
a convert to Islam, was being interviewed by Mr Harper, 42, before a
remand appearance.
He is accused of murdering garage owner Mr Antonio Marrocco, 48, and
his business partner, Mr Paul Sandham, 28, in nearby Morecambe in
January. Mr Marrocco was found battered and stabbed to death in his
garage on January 24. Hours later, Mr Sandham's body was found in a
field. He had been stabbed more than 30 times.
Mr Howarth said Mr Clifton had threatened his solicitor during the
siege but it was not known what had prompted the incident.
Minutes before the drama ended, police said Mr Harper was ''bearing up
very well'', adding: ''He appears to be tired but coherent''.
Trained negotiators had been in touch with Mr Clifton and a Muslim
holy man was called in at Mr Clifton's request.
Mr Clifton, who had been brought from Walton Prison, Liverpool, is
understood to have been searched at the prison and when he arrived at
court. The ''sharp instrument'' is believed to have been the metal
binder from a document file.
Lancashire's assistant chief constable, Mr David Smith, said later
that officers moved into the interview room shortly before 10am.
''They overpowered the prisoner. The successful outcome was that Mr
Harper was released without harm to either of them. Mr Harper was shaken
by his ordeal.''
Later, Mr Harper was interviewed at a nearby police station but
declined to speak to reporters about his experience.
Mr Smith said: ''He does not feel able to speak to you directly. But
he has asked me to express his appreciation of the efforts of the police
and prison service in securing his release. His demeanour during his
ordeal has been exemplary.
''I wish to pay tribute to the calm way he disported himself. This was
a factor in bringing this to a successful resolution.''

HUNDREDS of twitchers were heading for Orkney yesterday after one of

the steppes of central Asia.
''We've warned the police about potential traffic problems because
between 50 and 100 carloads of twitchers could be out looking for it,''
said Orkney RSPB officer Eric Meek. There have been just seven previous

Miss Rhys-Jones, 30, took a day off from her job as a public relations

Lord Ivar Mountbatten.
The prince, currently presenting a series of Channel 4 TV
documentaries on real tennis, was thought to be hard at work with his
company, Ardent Productions.
A royal aide said the prince -- unlike the Queen -- was not a great
racing fan and could bear to be away from Ascot.
Miss Rhys-Jones, who wore a long navy blue and white printed skirt,
short white jacket and wide-brimmed navy hat, went into the Royal Ascot
Enclosure but was not a guest in the Royal Box.

GROUP Captain Peter Townsend, whose love Princess Margaret renounced
for duty, was buried yesterday in a quiet corner of a French cemetery
overlooking his beloved home in exile.
After a simple church service, the Battle of Britain hero's coffin,
draped in a Union Jack and the RAF flag, was lowered into a grave as his
family, local dignitaries, and representatives of the Royal Family
looked on.
In 1955, Princess Margaret's announcement that she would not marry the
group captain stunned the nation. The establishment could not
countenance the marriage of a divorced commoner to the Queen's sister,
third in line of succession to the throne.
Yesterday's service at the tenth century village church at St
Leger-en-Yvelines, south-west of Paris, combined English hymns and
French prayers.
The group captain's widow Marie-Luce led the mourners to the graveside
in the tiny cemetery next to the hillside church.
Standard bearers from the Royal British Legion, the Royal Air Force
Association, and French veterans' associations also attended.
The British Ambassador to France, Sir Christopher Mallaby, represented
the Queen at the service, while Air Commodore Sir Archie Windskill
represented the Queen Mother.
Princess Margaret was not represented and yesterday flew to San
Francisco for a week-long official visit.
She had been said to be ''saddened'' by the group captain's death and
is thought to have sent a private message of sympathy to his widow.
Many of Group Captain Townsend's family attended the service,
including his three children from his second marriage, Marie Francoise,
Isobel, and Pierre.

THE Prince of Wales yesterday met former loyalist prisoners on the
Belfast streets where he was mobbed by thousands of cheering people.
Police struggled to control the huge crowd of mainly women and
children on the Shankill Road.
Yards from where the IRA killed nine Protestants in a bomb attack at a
fishmonger's shop, the prince spoke to some of the key men who were
involved in brokering the loyalist ceasefire.
He was introduced to former paramilitaries Billy Hutchinson and
William Smith of the Progressive Unionist Party while at a business
centre to meet community leaders.
Later on the streets, where he was given a tumultuous reception, he
shook hands with their party colleague David Ervine, another
ex-prisoner.
Politics were not discussed but, according to Mr Hutchinson, the visit
lifted the spirits of a community still trying to come to terms with an
end to 25 years of bloodshed.
Crush barriers were needed to help keep the crowds back. One woman
kissed the prince on the cheek.
Mr Hutchinson, who spent 16 years in jail for his part in the murder
of two Roman Catholics, said: ''The people's confidence has taken a
knock since the ceasefire and a lot of people have been quite negative.
''They think a united Ireland is only around the corner but we don't
believe that for one minute. Our future is in the United Kingdom for the
next 100 years.
''The future king chose to come to the Shankill. There is a feelgood
factor for people and that can't be bad. He has helped restore their
confidence.''
It was in October 1993 that the nine were blown up. One of the IRA men
involved in the attack was also killed.
Yesterday, there were scenes only of joy as the prince went walkabout.
Dr Joe Hendron, SDLP MP for West Belfast and one of the few Catholics
in the crowd, said: ''This doesn't show a return to normality. It proves
normality is here.''

GREENPEACE'S self-styled captain, Jonathan Castle, landed at Lerwick
last night expecting to be arrested. He was greeted not by police
officers but cheering crowds.
Mr Castle faces arrest for failure to obey an order to appear at the
Court of Session and name the other protesters who took part in
Greenpeace's original occupation of Brent Spar.
However, officials at Lerwick Sheriff Court said they understood that
it was entirely up to Shell UK whether officers of the Court of Session
had him arrested.
Mr Castle said: ''I'm no legal mind but it seems very odd to me. I
suppose I'm pleased but, if I had gone to court, I would have used it as
a platform to express my opinion, which is that the courts should be
using their powers to lock up polluters, not to chase people like me.''
Meanwhile, Highland Regional Council's director of development, Mr
Peter Mackintosh, has recommended to Shell that it use the mothballed
Kishorn yard in Wester Ross, which has a dry dock and deep-water
facility, for breaking up the Spar.
He said: ''Reopening Kishorn is extremely feasible and Shell are
considering the offer. We have all the skills in the area to carry out
the work.''
A spokesman for Shell said: ''Kishorn is one of a number of options
which we are looking at -- but it is early days. We are still
negotiating with the Norwegian authorities for Spar to be parked
somewhere and that is our immediate aim -- to get a sheltered spot for
it. We cannot bring it in to the UK because its draught is too great,
even for the west coast.''
He added that Shell had already turned down an offer by a Dutch
company, HeereMac, to decommission the Spar at Kishorn by bringing it in
vertically then reducing its draught to 80 metres by pumping compressed
air into it.
''We examined the proposal very carefully but there are many
environmentally sensitive channels on the west coast which are just 88
metres deep. We felt that an eight metre clearance was insufficient and
we turned down the offer,'' said the spokesman.
''However, Kishorn is very definitely an option once work has been
carried out to reduce the size of the Brent Spar. But that is way down
the line. We have to get a licence from the Government first to bring
the rig ashore,'' he said.
Councillors are eager to support any moves to establish the Highlands
as a rig decommissioning centre.
Rig construction work is drying up for Brown and Root at Nigg, Easter
Ross, and McDermotts at Ardersier, near Inverness, which recently merged
to form Barmac.
Wester Ross's regional councillor, Mr Norman Cameron, said: ''Brent
Spar could be just the thing to bring a much-needed financial
injection.''
Meanwhile, the Shadow Environment Secretary, Mr Frank Dobson, called
for an independent audit to be carried out on the Brent Spar before any
decision was taken about the method of its disposal.
He has asked Environment Secretary John Gummer to establish the
physical, chemical, and biological state of the installation.
''The method of dealing with the Brent Spar cannot be sorted out until
the discrepancies between Shell's views of these characteristics and
those of Greenpeace have been cleared up,'' he said.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>977731846</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A DOG was blamed by a sheriff yesterday for a farm accident which
killed his mistress.
Mrs Bridget MacGillivray, a 50-year-old mother of two, died when her
all-terrain vehicle reversed and crushed her against the wall of a
steading at Davochfin Farm, near Dornoch, on May 2.
A fatal accident inquiry at Dornoch Sheriff Court was told Mrs
MacGillivray's right leg was almost severed and she suffered a major
blow to the face when the vehicle pushed her into the wall.
Moments after the accident, the dog was seen standing motionless near
his mistress as she lay dead on the floor.
Sheriff James Scott ruled at the end of the inquiry that her
10-year-old border collie, Duke, had caused the vehicle to reverse by
sitting on the accelerator.
The inquiry heard the dog had been in the habit of riding in the cab
of the vehicle, a Kawasaki Mule, near the driver's seat.
Mrs MacGillivray's husband, Malcolm, said he was satisified with the
outcome of the inquiry. However, he intended keeping the dog, and added:
''It wasn't his fault.''
The inquiry was also told that the vehicle manufacturers have since
been advised to post warning notices and ''no dogs'' signs in the cabs.
The Sheriff ruled that Mrs MacGillivray had been working alone at the
farm on the day of the accident.
She was using the vehicle to deliver feed to animal pens and had left
the vehicle in reverse gear with the engine running and no hand-brake
on.
Police accident investigator Sergeant William Anderson said the
vehicle had no clutch pedal but when in gear, it would move very quickly
forwards or backwards if pressure was put on the accelerator.
He agreed with fiscal Henry Westwater that a dog sitting or lying on
the pedal could have caused the vehicle to shoot backwards.
When he arrived at the scene, Mr Anderson said the handbrake was on,
the engine was running, and it was in reverse gear. He added that it
would not have moved without the dog or someone putting pressure on the
accelerator.
He added that an inspection of the vehicle showed no mechanical
failures.
Earlier, Mr MacGillivray, 58, who ran the farm with his late wife,
said he had been away on the day of her death, visiting Suisgill Estate,
near Helmsdale, where he is the factor.
He said he earlier used the Mule. It had been bought only 10 days
previously and Mrs MacGillivray had driven it only three times before.
''It was common for our two dogs, Duke and another border collie, Jan,
to accompany us on the farm rounds. When I used the Mule, Jan would
sometimes jump in the back and Duke sat at my feet on the floor of the
cab,'' he said.
The inquiry heard Mrs MacGillivray was found minutes after the
accident by Mrs Irene Drummond, 49, who had come to help her clear out
the steading.
Miss Drummond said she found her friend lying on the steading floor,
obviously badly injured.
She said she ran to fetch help from neighbours and raised the alarm.
She told the inquiry she noticed Mrs MacGillivray's watch, which read
10.10am.
Consultant pathologist, Mrs Rosalind Rankin, examined Mrs MacGillivray
at the scene and also carried out a post-mortem examination.
She said Mrs MacGillivray died of crushing injuries with the main
injury to her right leg, which was almost amputated in the accident and
resulted in severe blood loss.
There was also an injury to the back of her left leg where she was hit
by the vehicle and a blow to the face where she struck the wall, which
hastened her death.
Health and Safety Inspector Raymond Codd said he carried out an
investigation at the farm which concluded that the dog had caused the
accident.
''I could not see what else had happened to be honest,'' he said.
At the end of the evidence, Mr Westwater said: ''This was a tragic
accident and hardly a foreseeable one.''
Sheriff Scott expressed his sympathy to Mr MacGillivray and his
children, Angus, 25, and Claire, 28.

AN INNOCENT game of hide-and-seek ended with a 13-year-old boy having
sex with a six-year-old girl, a court heard yesterday.
The offence came to light when the girl's horrified mother discovered
her daughter under the bedclothes with the boy.
When he was questioned by the police, the emotionally immature
teenager said: ''I didn't really mean to do it. Voices in my head told
me not to do it but I was excited. I was very confused at the time.''
The boy admitted having unlawful sexual intercourse with the girl in a
village in East Lothian in May last year.
The boy's parents were at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday as
Lord Kirkwood was told that the youngsters were neighbours and played
together.
Mr Michael O'Grady, prosecuting, said that when the girl's mother went
into the bedroom and discovered what was happening she yelled at the
boy, who ran away. Gradually, she coaxed her daughter to tell her about
the incident.
The boy told police that he and the girl had been playing
hide-and-seek and ended up hiding under the bedclothes.
Mr O'Grady told the court that the boy's mother felt that her son, now
14, was in need of help rather than punishment.
Mr Neil Murray, QC, defence counsel, said that, at the time of the
incident, his client was emotionally and intellectually very much
younger than his age.
He handed Lord Kirkwood a note written by the boy, which read: ''The
thing I don't like about the court is that it makes me feel like a real
criminal. It is very scary.''
The court was told that the boy had admitted the offence because he
didn't want to put his victim through any more difficulty.
Lord Kirkwood deferred sentence until July 14 to obtain the advice of
the Children's Panel.

POLLUTION threats like the dumping of the Brent Spar and the Braer
spillage also pose large dangers to Scotland's food industry, a
conference was told yesterday.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace, MP for Orkney and
Shetland, said food and drink production was vital to the Scottish
economy, employing 67,000 people and contributing #2000m a year to the
economy.
However, its success was critically dependent on Scotland's reputation
for quality and purity. ''We do identify the pollution of the seas, or
even the perceived pollution of the seas, as a potential threat to the
marketing of quality produce,'' Mr Wallace said.
The theme was taken up by SNP leader Alex Salmond, who said the Brent
Spar decision had also showed the power of consumer action to change
boardroom attitudes. He urged supermarket chains to increase their stock
of Scottish produce.
He said there was a great disparity between the efforts by Government
to bring industry to Scotland compared with efforts to support Scottish
industry.
The Irish Government would be spending #641m over the next five years
to promote its food industry compared with a paltry #30m by the Scottish
Office over the same period.
''We know that the Scottish food industry has enormous growth
potential but we are not providing anything like enough back-up compared
to our major competitors,'' Mr Salmond added.
Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, sponsors of the Edinburgh
conference, said it was committed to buying more from Scottish farmers
and producers.
Despite the economic importance of the food industry, the relative
poverty of the average Scottish diet was highlighted by Professor
Michael Lean, who holds the chair of human nutrition at Glasgow
University.
He said health education programmes often fell short of altering
eating habits conditioned by slick marketing. It was essential that the
food industry adapted to help meet new targets for improving the
Scottish diet.

THE youngest member of the family which a sheriff said had brought
misery to a whole community was granted his freedom yesterday , after
complaining to the Appeal Court about the sheriff's remarks.
Joseph Haney, 20, of Raploch, Stirling, was granted interim liberation
by a judge in chambers in Edinburgh pending a full hearing.
Haney was sentenced to 60 days at Stirling Sheriff Court in May for
loitering with intent.
Before announcing the sentence, Sheriff Norrie Stein had criticised
the whole Haney family.
The sheriff said: ''What troubles me is the misery that his particular
family has inflicted on the Raploch community for many many years.''
Haney's appeal was on the grounds that his sentence had been wrong and
unjust, citing Sheriff Stein's remarks.
It may, however, never be heard in full. By coincidence, Haney reached
the end of his sentence yesterday anyway, having gained full remission.

A TORY MP is to resign as head of a safe driving group after being
fined #140 for speeding at more than 100mph.
Mr Roger Gale, the 51-year-old MP for Thanet North, Kent, was driving
at an average speed of 102.7mph when stopped on the M26 in Kent on
Easter Saturday.
Mr Gale is the East Kent president of the Institute of Advanced
Motorists. His lawyer told the court he now planned to resign.
Sevenoaks magistrates heard yesterday he was driving his Rover 214 to
a constituency meeting soon after 8am and was late after getting caught
in traffic.
He told police he had just returned from a parliamentary trip to South
Africa. ''I knew I was going over 70 but I didn't realise it was that
fast. I have been flying all night so I probably wasn't concentrating.''
He pleaded guilty and had six penalty points added to his licence and
was ordered to pay #35 costs.
Mr Gale had one previous conviction, in 1982, for driving a car while
it was overloaded with bricks for an extension to his home in Preston,
Kent. He was fined #25 and had three penalty points imposed.
In an attempt to prevent a driving ban, the bench was handed Mr Gale's
diary, which showed he had 84 engagements in July alone in London and
Kent.
His wife was prepared to act as a chauffeur but the court was told she
had broken her ankle and would find driving very difficult.

<HEADLINE>Blair's new Labour ditches 'old left' education dogma</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977731851</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday turned his back for good on the
''old left'' vision of education.
In a speech, he questioned a string of sixties shibboleths, from
mixed-ability teaching to the link between poverty and school
performance.
He implicitly ditched the notion that extra spending on its own was
the answer to education problems and declared Labour's mission to
modernise the comprehensive system.
Mr Blair's comments, in a speech at London University's Institute of
Education, were broadly welcomed by the teaching unions.
However, Liberal Democrat education spokesman Don Foster accused him
of stealing his party's ideas.
Mr Blair rejected the ''dogma of the new right'', committing Labour
against selection at age 11.
However, he reserved damning criticism for the dogma of the old left.
It was ''the reason why the left has been losing general elections for
the past 16 years'', he said.
Mr Blair's speech came only 24 hours after infuriating Labour
traditionalists -- including former deputy leader Roy Hattersley -- by
refusing unambiguously to abolish grant-maintained schools.
His sights are set on winning Tory voters and replacing a Government
he said was in ''terminal decline''.
Education policy since the war had failed to find a way of combining
support and pressure as a means of raising standards, Mr Blair said.
Pressure meant pupil testing, teacher appraisal, and school
inspection; support meant more money, teacher development, community
involvement, and national leadership.
Neither, on its own, was adequate. Combined, they could drive up
education standards, vital for Britain's economic future.
Mr Blair condemned ''poverty of aspiration'' in education and said
instead of blaming low performance on ''socio-economic factors'' new
Labour was prepared to blame bad teachers.
For the old left, it had been a ''taboo'' to say that bad teachers had
to go but the people who suffered were ''traditional Labour voters'',
not the well-off and articulate.
Setting out new policy proposals to raise standards, Mr Blair started
with primary schools -- for too long a ''poor relation''.
Children should leave primary school with a firm grasp of the three
Rs. To help guarantee this, they should start with a ''baseline
assessment'' of what they knew.
Tests for five-year-olds were being pioneered in some local
authorities. It was time to develop national guidelines, Mr Blair said.
While rigid streaming within schools was a ''waste of talent'', Labour
should recognise differences of capability between children in different
subjects.
''Streaming, with its rigid distribution of children into bright,
average, and backward camps, is a waste of talent, which is why
mixed-ability teaching was introduced.
''But mixed-ability achievement is not an end in itself. The end is
high achievement.''
Turning to teachers, Mr Blair said Labour wanted to recognise those
who ''sparkled''.
While pointedly saying nothing about pay, he floated the idea of
''teacher professors'' who could be seconded to spread good practice.
Other teachers could be promoted to the new grade of ''expert
teacher'' to help persuade them to stay in the classroom rather than go
into management.
He allied himself with those calling for a reform of 16-19 education,
making it clear that, unlike the Government, Labour did not consider
A-levels sacrosanct.
Labour's aim was a ''system of post-16 study that allows every young
person to combine academic and vocational study according to aptitude
and interest''.

POLICE raided what appeared to be a health food shop and found sex
toys along with videos and magazines.
Shop boss Howell Rees was fined a total of #2300 at Edinburgh Sheriff
Court yesterday. He had earlier been found guilty by Sheriff John
Horsburgh of running a sex shop without a licence and selling or
distributing obscene material.
Police officers first went into the shop -- Private Lines on Elm Row,
Edinburgh -- in May last year, then returned in August to find more
magazines and sex aids. The shop also sold children's videos.
Father-of-three Rees, 39, from Kilmarnock, had denied selling or
distributing obscene material on May 6 and August 24, 1994. He also
denied two charges of running a sex shop without a licence.
During the trial, Constable Matthew Allan told depute-fiscal
Jacqueline Currie that items seized in the May raid included numerous
magazines and videos, various vibrators, and a blow-up doll.
Shop assistant Edward Greenway, 55, said the shop opened from 9.30am
to 6pm and also sold herbal products, vitamins, and things such as
evening primrose oil and cod liver oil.

THE son of former Scotland and Rangers footballer Sandy Jardine was
acquitted last night of drugs charges.
Steven Jardine, 22, had denied being concerned in the supply of
cannabis, possessing it with intent to supply, and growing the drug in a
flat in Edinburgh.
A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh took nearly five hours to return
four not guilty verdicts and one of not proven in the five charges faced
by Mr Jardine.
During the trial, the jury heard that, acting on a tip-off, police
raided a flat in Dalgety Avenue, Edinburgh, on February 16 this year.
They found about 175 cannabis plants and 4.5 kilos of cannabis resin.
The total value of the haul was estimated at #38,000 and the flat was
described as being like a tropical nursery of cannabis plants.
Mr Jardine, a roofer, of Orchardhead Road, Edinburgh, lodged a special
defence incriminating the owner of the flat.
He also alleged that police had ''fitted him up'' on the drugs
charges. When he was asked by Mr Michael O'Grady, prosecuting, why
police would have done that, Mr Jardine replied: ''They must be Celtic
supporters.''
Two co-accused, Calum Slythe, 29, who now lives in Kent, and Kevin
Peters, 24, of Restalrig Road South, Edinburgh, also were cleared of
drugs charges.

FILM actor Liam Neeson and his actress wife Natasha Richardson were
yesterday celebrating the arrival of a baby son.
Their first child, weighing in at more than 8lbs, was born in Dublin
on Thursday. Neeson, 42, was present for the birth.
The boy, who has not yet been named, is a third grandchild for actress
Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha's mother.
''Liam Neeson was there for the birth and mother and baby are both
well. He weighed more than 8lbs and is bouncing around,'' said
Redgrave's agent, Mr James Sharkey.
''The baby doesn't have a name yet. Apparently, the parents are still
looking and saying: 'What shall we call him?'
''Vanessa and her mother, Lady Redgrave, are both absolutely thrilled.
They are in the South of France at the moment but are returning this
weekend to see the baby.''
Ms Richardson gave birth at the National Maternity Hospital in Holles
Street, Dublin, where a spokeswoman said staff had been asked not to
give out information.
Ballymena-born Neeson wed 32-year-old Ms Richardson last July.
Although based in the United States, the couple are currently in Ireland
for Neeson to film the story of Irish republican hero Michael Collins.
They met when they starred in the Broadway production of Eugene
O'Neill's Anna Christie two years ago. They married in the garden of
their farm in upstate New York.
The baby becomes the latest addition to the Redgrave acting dynasty
founded by Sir Michael Redgrave.

THERE was bad news yesterday for textile workers in Scotland. Dawson
International announced further job cuts in the Borders and Dumfries and
Galloway and up to a quarter of the workforce at Hunters Woollen Mill in
Brora, Sutherland, are to be made redundant.
The announcement by Dawson comes only weeks after hundreds of
redundancies from its flagship company, Pringle of Scotland.
The news also comes on the heels of million pound golden handshake
packages awarded to senior management which infuriated workers thrown
into a shrinking jobs market with statutory severance plus one week's
pay for every three years' service.
The latest cuts affect 75 workers. The worst hit centre is Hawick,
where 56 jobs are going on top of more than 80 announced earlier by
Pringle. Another 19 jobs will be lost at Sanquhar.
Dawson says the cuts are part of a continuing programme to improve
performance and reduce costs at a tough time in the textile market. The
latest annual reports show that sales for Dawson United Brands had
dropped 6% in a year and the firm was trading at a loss.
The Hawick-based managing director of United Brands, Mr Douglas
Needham, said yesterday: ''It is sad to have to make redundancies but
our future depends on how we are able to change within the business. It
is a matter of becoming more flexible and faster on our feet in order to
face the competition that comes at us from overseas. We are cutting back
to a core that we hope to progress from.''
Hunters Woollen Mill in Brora, which has been trading for more than
100 years, currently employs around 100 people but chief executive
Raymond Eagleson confirmed yesterday that his company wants 23
redundancies and is consulting the workforce.
Mr Eagleson blamed the cuts on a drop in orders and a huge rise in
fibre prices.
He said: ''There has been a huge drop in future orders, which is very
disturbing. The order book hit a super-peak for June, and now nobody
wants delivery after July. But we are in the same boat as the rest of
the trade.''
He said: ''We are fairly confident that in six months' time, when the
market has settled, business will resume. But it is difficult for the
market to adjust to a large price increase.''
Mr Eagleson also hoped a new #10m mill for Hunters would secure the
future of the company. Outline planning permission was given by Highland
Regional Council last September, with Caithness and Sutherland
Enterprise confirming funding of #6.5m to the project.
Mr Eagleson said: ''A new mill will most definitely ease the problem
and give us a wider product base to operate from.''

<HEADLINE>Council leaders attack suspension decision and PM's 'music hall jokes'. Black report under fire at Monklands</HEADLINE>

LEADERS of Monklands District Council last night criticised Mr Tony
Blair over the decision to suspend the entire ruling Labour group after
the independent inquiry into alleged corruption and impropriety in the
authority.
They also attacked Prime Minister John Major for making ''music hall
jokes'' which they said had insulted the people of Monklands.
The council last night rejected the principal criticisms contained in
the inquiry report published by Professor Robert Black, QC, earlier this
week and agreed to ask him to provide ''clarification'' on a number of
points and ''corrections'' of others.
The council had hoped that the inquiry, which it asked Professor Black
to conduct, would clear the air and disprove allegations which have
hounded the authority for several years. However, the professor found
that the council had operated a ''jobs for the boys'' policy and that
there was a spending imbalance in favour of Coatbridge and against
Airdrie.
National Labour officials immediately ordered the suspension of the
council's ruling group from the party, pending their own investigation
into the allegations.
However, last night, after a special council meeting to discuss the
report, council leader Jim Brooks said he did not feel that the decision
was justified. ''I think the Labour Party has been hasty. They should
have waited until they had interviewed us.''
Deputy leader Jim Smith said: ''As councillors, we feel that the
Labour Party should have given us the chance to go through things as we
did at the council meeting tonight.''
Provost Eric Burns agreed that he felt he had been let down by the
party. ''By suspending me, I feel I have been criminalised. Yes, I feel
hurt. I always thought that in this country you were presumed innocent
until found guilty.'' Nevertheless, he welcomed Labour's decision to
hold a new investigation and said he was sure it would vindicate the
council.
Councillor Brooks declared that there was no corruption in the
Monklands council and blamed the media for spreading allegations which
had damaged the district.
Earlier, during the council meeting, Councillor Brooks attacked the
Prime Minister, who earlier this week in the Commons likened the
council's personnel department to a ''family planning'' agency, a
reference to the number of councillors' relatives employed by the
authority.
Councillor Brooks said: ''This council has been subjected to
horrendous publicity and made to look a circus by the highest authority
in the land, who decides to make a music hall joke out of us. I take
grave exception to that. He has offended people.''
Only 68 employees out of a total workforce of more than 1500 were
related to councillors, and some of those employees had served for as
long as 35 years, he said.
Councillor Brooks also dismissed allegations of a spending imbalance.
He argued that major capital projects such as the Time Capsule, the
Summerlee Heritage centre and Drumpellier Country Park could only have
been sited in the Coatbridge area, and they served the whole district.
He added that spending on housing was higher in Coatbridge because it
had more flats, accommodation which was more costly to maintain than
cottage-type properties.
However, SNP councillor Neil Douglas said: ''We have suffered in
Airdrie as a result of the complacency and arrogance of certain
councillors in this chamber.''
During the meeting, Councillor Brooks and other committee conveners
dismissed one by one the many allegations described in the 32-page
report.
At one stage, at the request of Labour councillor Tony Clarke, the
council instructed chief executive Maurice Hart to ask each councillor
present if they were a member of the Knights of St Columba. This was
because Professor Black had referred in his report to suggestions made
to the inquiry that a number of councillors on important committees were
members of that organisation.
All the Labour councillors present told Mr Hart that they were not
members of the Knights. Members of the SNP group refused to answer,
saying it was a ridiculous exercise.
As proceedings drew to a close, Councillor Douglas attempted, on
behalf of the SNP group, to move a motion of no confidence in the
council's ruling group. He said: ''The Labour Party thought its name
would be cleared by Professor Black's report. It most emphatically was
not.''
Provost Burns, chairing the meeting, ruled the motion incompetent. The
provost said: ''I am not prepared to accept that, because there are
allegations and statements which have been made without proof.''
Among several councillors absent from last night's meeting were the
four so-called ''rebel'' Labour members who have previously criticised
the way the council is run.

KVAERNER Govan has confirmed that three key managerial staff have left
the shipyard, as revealed by The Herald yesterday.
The Norwegian-owned yard said technical director Dirk Dijkstra,
personnel and employee relations director Bobby Gordon, and general
manager Jim Thomson have left the firm.
It refused to give reasons but the move is thought to be linked to the
yard's failure to achieve productivity objectives.
The three managers had many years of service for the yard, under
various owners, with Mr Gordon having worked there at different times
since 1960.
Kvaerner Govan's managing director, Mr Kjell Mikalsen, said: ''I would
like to thank Dirk, Bobby, and Jim for their contribution to the yard
and wish them well for the future.
''Govan has entered a new phase in which we aim to raise productivity
by 30% to ensure that we win future contracts.
''My target is to make Kvaerner Govan's productivity good enough to
win the vital contracts that will secure the 1300 full-time jobs in the
yard to the year 2000 and beyond.''
Although the parent company has invested more than #30m at Govan and
turned around the yard's losses of #30m to #40m per year when Kvaerner
bought it seven years ago to a ''modest profit'', it has struggled to
bring the yard's productivity into line with others in the group in
Norway, Finland, and Germany.
The Govan yard, which is currently finishing the last of four chemical
carriers for a Middle East customer and a helicopter landing ship for
VSEL, is competing against other Kvaerner yards to build a command ship
for a floating platform that would launch satellites from the Pacific
Ocean.

A FORMER health chief emerged from a self-imposed silence yesterday to
lend his weight to a campaign to have a community hospital sited at
Ballochmyle in Ayrshire.
Mr Bill Fyfe, the former chairman of Greater Glasgow Health Board, who
resigned amid political acrimony in 1993, shared a platform with
campaigners who want the new hospital to be at Ballochmyle instead of a
site still to be identified at Cumnock.
He left the board in Glasgow after less than a year, during which he
was never far from controversy. Mr Fyfe clashed on many occasions with
general manager Laurence Peterken and eventually sacked him, a move
which led to a political storm and the end of Mr Fyfe's health board
career.
Mr Peterken was given a senior post in the health service after his
dismissal by Mr Fyfe.
In the Commons, Mr Ian Lang, the Secretary of State for Scotland,
apparently disowned the man viewed by many as spearheading the
Government's unpopular health service reforms when he said: ''I am
satisfied he was the architect of his own downfall.''
While Mr Fyfe stressed that he was acting in an individual capacity,
it appears that he might be ready to step back into the public arena 18
months after a serious car crash on the Eaglesham moor road, shortly
after he had resigned.
He was speaking on the last day for public consultation on a plan to
build a new community hospital serving the health needs of the people of
East Ayrshire.
A wide range of submissions, as well as the results of public meetings
and petitions, will be considered by Ayrshire and Arran Health Board on
July 7 and a decision announced on the site shortly afterwards.
The board wants a hospital which encompasses a GP unit, outpatient and
paramedical services, and short and long-stay accommodation for the
elderly.
The argument has become polarised with the North Ayrshire and
Community Health Care NHS Trusts joining local GPs in supporting the
Cumnock option, and the South Ayrshire Trust winning the support of
other GPs and medical specialists for their plan to redevelop the
Ballochmyle hospital site.
Mr Fyfe expressed his disappointment that the debate had become
''bogged down in a divisive argument that puts Mauchline and Cumnock at
loggerheads'', and called for a broader, more inclusive view of the
arguments.
Mr Fyfe envisages a ''hub hospital'' taking community integrated care
services out to the 33,000 residents of the area from Ballochmyle, which
he stressed is already in public ownership and fully serviced.
He went on to challenge the health board to act swiftly in the best
interests of local people and those who will carry out the development
to set target dates and meet them.

MR Major's chief lieutenant in his leadership battle, Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang, last night predicted the party rules would be
changed to prevent a sitting Prime Minister having to fight for his
survival in this way again.
At the end of the ''absolute pandemonium'' of the first day of running
the Major campaign headquarters, Mr Lang also forecast the Prime
Minister would see off the challenge comfortably without any need to
face more than one ballot.
On the rules issue, he said: ''I think there is a strong feeling in
the party that to have the leader of the party as Prime Minister,
leading the Government of the day, being subject to the pressure of a
potential challenge from within his own ranks is undesirable.
''I would expect the 1922 Committee in due course to look at the rules
and party bureaucracy as they stand.''
Mr Lang gave an account from inside Mr Major's inner circle of how he
had come to the unprecedented decision to resign the party leadership as
a dramatic way of issuing a ''back me or sack me'' challenge to
opponents within his party. It was felt they were undermining his
position and threatening to make his premiership untenable.
Mr Lang revealed: ''He had been consulting with a number of colleagues
privately. He reached a view on Wednesday night and called me at
breakfast on Thursday. We had a meeting in the Cabinet Room and he asked
if I would join the steering group under Lord Cranborne.''
Mr Lang has become, in effect, the Prime Minister's media minder, the
so-called spin doctor. The group took over an office at Cowley Street,
close to Westminster, within hours of the resignation announcement and
spent yesterday installing telephone lines for a campaign team of 10.
The first phase of the campaign is a media blitz to seize the agenda
before Mr Major's opponents on the Euro-sceptic right of the party even
have a candidate to rally round.
''We had a lot of MPs who have been phoning in to offer their support
and calling around finding out where others stand. It is a very
encouraging start but we haven't got into the numbers game yet because
we don't even know if there will be a contest,'' Mr Lang said.
He played down the impact of Mr Douglas Hurd's intended resignation.
''It slightly increases the Prime Minister's room for manoeuvre,'' he
said.
Mr Lang said a certain amount of ''teasing'' was going on by potential
contenders but his message was: ''The Prime Minister is ready for
them.''
This was, he claimed, typical of the man he has been close to ever
since they worked together in the Whips' office. ''We are good
friends,'' he said. ''I like and admire him. He has always been much
more decisive and courageous than he has been given credit for.''
He cited foreign policy, such as the Gulf war and in the Bosnia
hostage crisis, where his firm stances were vindicated.
Now he had shown resolution on the home front. ''This is the first
leadership election to be triggered by an incumbent,'' said Mr Lang.
''He is determined to sort the whole thing out once and for all.''

THE prospect of further political damage to the Tories was savoured at
a food conference, with relish, by leaders of the Scottish opposition
parties.
They were attending the conference in Edinburgh when news of Mr Hurd's
resignation broke.
All three agreed that the Foreign Secretary was probably a sacrifice
to ensure right-wing votes for Mr Major in the leadership contest.
The Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said: ''They have
lost one of the best Ministers in the Government.
''The shambles goes on and I don't think they have the slightest clue.
This is the politics of Bedlam. Clearly they cannot be trusted to run
the country and they should go.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''There is an element of disintegration
in politics and sometimes it takes over. I don't think anyone knows how
far this process will go on. It looks as though were are now on one
resignation a day.''
He said the SNP was preparing for a General Election: ''We cannot rule
this out, although the only thing the Conservative Party is agreed on is
that there should not be a General Election.''
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said: ''It seems
clear that anyone who has a record of being strongly committed to Europe
is now having to pay sacrifices.
''This Government is more led by divisions in its ranks than by any
leadership from people at the top. Clearly it is becoming more and more
unstable and the losers in this are the people of Scotland and the
people of Britain.''
Mr Wallace said he believed the Government would carry on without
calling an election. ''Even the most loopy of them can recongise
annihilation when it stares them in the face.''

THE younger brother of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was fighting for
his life yesterday after being trampled by an animal on his farm last
weekend.
Dairy farmer Stephen Hurd, 62, was knocked to the ground and trampled
by a stampeding cow as he approached her sickly calf.
He suffered serious head and chest injuries in the accident and was
reported ''critical but stable'' on a ventilator in intensive care.
Mr Hurd, three years younger than the Foreign Secretary, was tending
livestock at his farm near Marlborough, Wiltshire, when the cow attacked
him.
The father-of-two crawled 200 yards from his cowshed to the farmhouse,
where he collapsed after the accident last Saturday.
Mr Hurd, who is a magistrate, was taken to Princess Margaret Hospital
in Swindon.
He and his brother Douglas grew up on Rainscombe Park farm at nearby
Oare.

FORMER Chancellor Norman Lamont is on the warpath, Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd has done the decent thing and announced his resignation,
and the hard-right Welsh Secretary John Redwood has shown the first sign
of Cabinet dissent.
All of this, on the first day of the Prime Minister's leadership
campaign, means the preliminary round is likely to be a real contest,
with Mr Lamont a likely champion of the Euro-sceptics.
Mr Hurd's announcement provided at least one boost for Mr Major: but
Mr Redwood, a right-wing hero, was playing hard to get.
The rest of the Cabinet signed up along with Mr Hurd for Mr Major,
some from preference, some to hold a line to see if he can ''sort it out
once and for all'' in the first ballot on July 4.
He requires 190 votes out of 329 to win. To win satisfactorily, he
needs more like 240.
Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave said on BBC Radio 4's PM
programme: ''I don't believe there is any question at all but that the
Cabinet is united behind him.''
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, in a rallying cry for Mr Major's
campaign, told a meeting of Tories in Edinburgh: ''For months party
workers, councillors and hundreds and thousands of ordinary members have
been angry, frustrated and depressed at the disunity, back-stabbing and
rumour-mongering. And now there is an opportunity to put that all behind
us, back John Major and turn our united guns on the Labour enemy.''
Despite the Cabinet backing, Mr Lamont appears poised to challenge Mr
Major for the leadership. Tory Euro-sceptics are regrouping after the
surprise announcement of the leadership election and last night they
were beginning to harden up enough support for him to stand.
One of them, Mr Nick Budgen acknowledged that Mr Major's decision had
taken them by surprise. ''But he has bought himself only 48 hours.''
Mr Lamont, a certain stalking horse candidate before the Prime
Minister brought the whole thing forward from November, had not fully
resolved his dilemma yesterday.
Mr Lamont's main consideration is the extent of the vote that could be
delivered to him by up to 40 Tory Euro-sceptics and others who are
attracted by his insistence that Northern Ireland should remain part of
the UK.
Until he knows his precise possibilities he will not announce his
candidacy, but it is getting very close to decision time for the former
Chancellor who led Mr Major's campaign to succeed Margaret Thatcher in
1990.
Beseiged by reporters at his London home, Mr Lamont yesterday confined
himself to ''no comment''. He needs to speak to his Kingston
constituency party even though it will become defunct.
With it disappearing under boundary changes before the next election,
he is faced with two considerations -- will standing help or hinder his
prospects of another seat? By standing can he encourage about 100
abstentions and damage Mr Major sufficiently to bring him down? Ideally,
Mr Lamont would like a new leader whose gratitude would extend to
bringing him back into the Cabinet.
Mr Ron Gill, his constituency chairman, offered no comfort. ''My
personal view is that John Major did the right thing and it would be
wrong, in the sense of fatal, for Norman Lamont to stand against him.
''If he did not stand, perhaps he could then live to fight another
day.''
Another leading Euro-sceptic, Billericay MP Teresa Gorman told LWT's
Richard Littlejohn -- Live and Uncut show she would be prepared to stand
if asked by enough colleagues. She said if ''we end up with the same
Prime Minister and the same policies we won't have achieved anything.''
She said Mr Lamont knew what went on ''behind the scenes'' in Europe.
Mrs Gorman said Mr Major had ''chosen to precipitate this row'',
adding she believed the winner should be someone who had committed
themselves to holding a referendum over Europe.
At Mr Major's campaign HQ, a beautiful Georgian house close to the
Commons in Cowley Street provided by back-bencher Neil Thorne, they were
already claiming heavy support building up for the Prime Minister.
His political secretary, Mr Howell James, is aware, however, that such
immediate support can be fickle. It has to be double checked and checked
again before nominations close at noon on Thursday -- as Baroness
Thatcher discovered to her cost in her disastrous leadership campaign.
''I'd vote for Major if I was still in the Commons,'' she said yesterday
en route from Paris to the US.
Mr Hurd's decision to retire after the election came as no surprise.
It has been on the cards for months that he wanted to go after 16 years
in Government, six of them as Foreign Secretary. It was the timing of
his announcement which shocked.
He said he wanted to ''disentangle'' himself from the leadership
election. His announcement does much more, as his Labour Shadow Robin
Cook observed. ''The only possible reason for the timing of today's
statement is to allow John Major to signal to his Euro-sceptics that
there is a vacancy at the top of the Cabinet table for one of them.''
It certainly does this. Mr Major's arm-twisters can dangle this
possibility in front of the Euro-sceptics who have caused Mr Hurd's
disenchantment with office and who have targeted the Prime Minister
himself. But Mr Major's supporters insist the Prime Minister will not
allow himself to be blackmailed or attempt blackmail to get votes.
Labour leader Tony Blair said Mr Hurd's announcement was further proof
that the Government was in terminal decline. ''This is a Government that
is now disintegrating by the hour, with these great offices of State
simply being traded about in the leadership election in the Conservative
Party.''
The behaviour of Mr Redwood was baffling. His aides told the BBC that
he would take the weekend to decide whether he could give Mr Major
unqualified support. This was later watered down with an explanation
that because Mr Redwood -- one of the three Cabinet Ministers described
by Mr Major as ''bastards'' in an unguarded moment -- was having a day
off and would make a formal statement on Monday. He had always supported
Mr Major, it was suggested.
This seemed a simplistic explanation to many MPs beginning today a
frantic weekend of consultation with their constituency parties and
political colleagues. Mr Redwood could have killed the speculation that
he was hanging back by bringing forward his Monday statement.
Others think the Welsh Secretary believes he will be sacked next month
anyway if Mr Major wins, so he might as well reserve his position in the
ballots. Some feel he might resign from the Cabinet on Monday and stand
himself as the standard of the right, having taken the weekend to assess
his support.
Mr Hurd's resignation, meanwhile, stunned Mr Arthur Bell, chairman of
the Scottish Tory Reform Group. ''If it is a sacrifice to the right,
then many of us in the party will be very angry,'' he said. ''There is
absolutely no point in the Conservative Party swinging to the right in
that the British people are expressing very loudly, as we have seen in
Perth and Kinross by-election and the local elections, a preference for
moderate government and not for extremism.''
On Mr Major's decision, Mr Bell said: ''I think it is the bravest move
any politician has made.''
It was, however, becoming increasingly likely that Mr Major's dearest
wish to be returned unopposed would not be fulfilled.
Mr Edward Leigh, sacked by Mr Major as Trade Minister, spoke for a
growing number of back benchers, when he told BBC 2's Newsnight Mr
Lamont ''may well stand. I believe there will now be a contest. I
believe it will probably be a heavyweight contest and not just a Micky
Mouse contest.''
Mr Leigh said he wants no more ''back biting'': this has been the
message from the Tory constituencies for months.
