JAMES TRAYNOR reports on a scramble among first gang of ten.
THE pre-occupation with the plight of Aberdeen, who continue to dangle
precariously over the premier-division trapdoor, has caused the real
danger to be overlooked.
Hardly a thought has been spared for the clubs scrambling to end their
exiles in a first division which will exact a heavy toll on ambition
before sanity prevails, if indeed it ever does.
Last year, the Scottish League was committed to four divisions, each
of 10 teams, and clubs pledged to preserve that structure for at least
five seasons. But if their word truly is their bond -- and that would be
a departure in a business in which deceit often abounds -- the Scottish
game could fall into disrepair.
Indeed, a growing number of managers believe the plight of some clubs
could become desperate, and some directors are beginning to ask if
gearing up for the top league is worth the risks and the costs.
In most cases, the strain of remaining full-time in the hope of
winning a place in the premier division either by finishing first or
through succeeding in a play-off with the second-bottom club in the top
league will mean reverting to part-time.
The financial implications of failure to promote themselves in every
sense will be severe. It's simple arithmetic and straightforward logic.
Some chairmen tried to alert others to the inherent dangers in opting
for four divisions of 10, but too few listened. Too many had been
spooked by the threat of a breakaway league -- remember the push by the
bigger clubs to form a Super League? -- and not enough directors were
thinking straight when called to decide the way ahead.
Now, they must live with real fear, and their anxiety should be
widespread because the standard of football, which is already dreadfully
low, will fall in conjunction with any reduction in the number of
full-time clubs. ''There have already been cut-backs and we are still in
the first season of five with four divisions of 10 clubs in each,'' said
Airdire's chairman, George Peat.
''This is a matter which should be of genuine and serious concern for
everyone. I just can't see all of the full-time clubs in the first
division remaining so without premier-division football at some point in
the near future.
''My own club could survive perhaps for two more years, but after
that, it is doubtful if we could remain full-time without the premier
division.''
Peat warned before the current structure was voted into being that it
would have an adverse effect on club finances, and he was particularly
disappointed he didn't win support of other outfits of similar standing.
Currently, there are 16 full-time clubs, although the likes of
Hamilton and St Mirren have a mixture of full and part-time players.
''If I hadn't argued for the need to have a play-off so that two first
division clubs would have the chance of promotion, then we wouldn't even
have been given that facility.
''I was also disappointed that the Scottish Professional Footballers'
Association did not become involved,'' Peat said. ''Surely having as
many full-time clubs as possible was in their interests also.''
Airdrie, of course, hope to be moving into a new 10,000 all-seater
stadium in a year, but they could find themselves in the same position
as St Johnstone, who have a modern ground which would enhance the
premier division, but unfortunately for them, they can't get membership.
The McDiarmid Park club have fallen 10 points behind leaders
Dunfermline, Dundee, and Raith Rovers, and appear unlikely to catch up
in the time left. The Perth club need to be in the premier division
where the real money is to be found.
Dunfermline almost escaped at the end of last season, but Falkirk
edged them out by one point on the last day of the season. Manager Bert
Paton was left stunned and couldn't believe another season in purgatory
beckoned, although his side's win against Stranraer the other night
enhanced the Fifers' chances of getting out.
The East End Park side are in an almost impossible situation because
they need to upgrade their facilities, which, frankly, are abysmal, and
they must always be trying to improve the quality of their team.
Debts can mount very quickly in the first division, as even the most
frugal of clubs have found in the past. Ambition does not come cheap as
Raith Rovers' chairman Alex Penman has discovered.
''I have put quite a lot of money into my club to fund a full time
set-up for two years,'' he said, ''and we are in the first year of that
programme.
''Of course, our success in the Coca Cola Cup has helped to the extent
that we might be able to stretch our commitment to three years, but we
really must get into the top division.
''I'd rather see my team fighting to get into a premier division of 16
clubs because that would give us a better chance of staying up, but as
things stand at the moment, I see little real merit in struggling for
promotion only to be faced with the prospect of falling back down again
almost immediately.''
The Stark's Park chairman knows also that promotion might help him
hold on a little longer to his manager, Jimmy Nicholl, who has been
making a name for himself, and will be enticed away sooner or later.
''There is little point in continuing like this,'' Penman added.
Dundee, who have been leading the way for most of the season so far,
face similar fears, and their manager, Jim Duffy, also said that selling
the best talent always has to be an option.
''Clubs might have to do that just to remain full-time in the first
division,'' added Duffy, who is hardly new to the pressures of promotion
and relegation.
''I've been there,'' he said. ''I missed out on the last day when I
was with Falkirk, and I won promotion on the last day when I was with
Partick Thistle, but the supporters and directors feel it more than
players. As for the manager, he knows he has a short span if there is no
success.
''A manager rarely gets three years unless he can show there has been
considerable improvement.
''There is a risk even for the bigger teams as you can see if you look
at Aberdeen. I believe that if the premier division had more teams, then
Willie Miller would have been able to make his changes and he would
still have been in a job today. But the premier division allows hardly
any room for error.
''A larger top division would help keep more clubs full-time, and that
would be preferable to what we have just now. It is up to the people in
charge of the big clubs to make the changes needed.''
All involved in the struggle to reach the premier division door agree
a larger top division would reduce the fear of failure and provide
greater opportunity for younger players to be introduced, and in reply
to those who say there would too many meaningless matches in a 16-team
top flight, they say that the premier division is already a split
competition.
''Look how far in front Rangers are at the moment,'' Duffy said.

<HEADLINE>Officials as dangerous as the thugs themselves</HEADLINE>

THE authorities continued yesterday to talk of deranged minorities,
and as the hours passed lending greater distance to the violence visited
upon a wonderfully accommodating Irish city, football's administrators
were recovering their composure and trotting out promises based on
nothing other than their own remarkable arrogance. Those people who at
this stage say the European Championship finals can be conducted safely
are as dangerous as the Englishmen who tore up parts of a Lansdowne Road
stand.
They could be encouraging foreign visitors, including Scots, to put
themselves at risk because the only certainty as football stands head
bowed in shame before the outside world is that the primeval people who
prevented a friendly international match between the Republic of Ireland
and England from being played in Dublin will strike again.
In most cases these thugs are driven by a hatred of someone else's
beliefs, the colour of their skin, or the sound of their language. Their
violence is not born on the terracings of football's grounds, rather
they have attached themselves to a sport which is universal.
''Anarchists are at work,'' Jim Farry of the SFA said. He is correct.
It is irresponsible of the FA's chief executive Graham Kelly to say
England should not be denied the championship finals, which are
scheduled for the summer of next year, and it is more utterly
preposterous than usual for FIFA's Joao Havelange to splutter his
platitudes about local difficulties. They may be that to someone who has
never had to cower from bricks and pieces of wood or protect a
frightened child, but to those closer to reality Dublin raises genuine
concerns.
The game's bureaucrats should not be allowed to tell supporters it
will be safe to attend matches during the finals and they must be
prevented from offering UEFA, a self-perpetuating body willing to
off-load responsibilities, assurances that all will be well.
For God's sake, how can the FA, who have an ancient president, Bert
Millichip, who spoke in defence of Eric Cantona, tell anyone that what
happened in Lansdowne Road couldn't happen in Leeds, Manchester,
Newcastle, Nottingham, Liverpool, Birmingham or London next summer?
It will be possible to segregate supporters in the English grounds
which will host matches, but it won't be so easy to keep them apart
outside or in the city centres. ''Ah, not our problem,'' football would
insist while pointing in the direction of the police authorities, and
for once football would be doing the right thing.
The only people who can provide a lead or say whether or not it is
safe to stage the European finals in England are the constabulary.
Unless the police decide they can cope and offer protection to genuine
fans and the citizens of the half dozen venues, the finals should not go
ahead. The FA and UEFA are concerned only with their image and loss of
revenue.
If there are any doubts at all, the finals should be moved.
No doubt the FA took comfort from the words of Detective Chief
Inspector Bryan Drew, who heads up the Football Intelligence Unit, when
he said yesterday that England is better placed than most other
countries to stage the tournament. He should try telling that to the
people who suffered at Stamford Bridge last week.
The resourcefulnes of the thugs should not be underestimated. They are
organised and plan months in advance. It would be an extremely foolish
policeman or a member of the FA who would believe these hooligans are
not planning some kind of demonstration during the finals.
Also, there will be fans of a similar bent in England on the backs of
their own national sides. The Dutch have their hooligans and so, too, do
the Germans, Italians, and Spaniards.
Then, of course, the Scots could be there also and although our people
have been remarkably well behaved over the last decade, complacency
would could be costly.
There is always the feeling that if the Scottish fans blow, it will be
spectacular.
Kelly may insist a minority of thugs shall not win the argument, but
football has to ask if it is all worth the risk?

FORMER SFA secretary Ernie Walker will inspect England's European
venues next week in the aftermath of the Dublin riots, and the
highly-respected legislator will have a major say in the security which
will surround the European Championship in l996.
And on top of that, the FA have been surprised by the amount of
sympathy they have received from the Continent.
Walker is chairman of UEFA's Stadia Committee, and in that role he
also carries responsibility for crowd troubles. It is an important
position, made more so after the Dublin troubles, and the influential
Scot has the ear of UEFA President Lennart Johansson.
The all-powerful Dane believes that fences may have to be built at the
English venues.
Last night he said: ''We will be meeting next week to discuss the
whole affair. Reports will come from the Irish FA, the FA and other
observers. Then we will come to a decision. Security has to be correct.
That is paramount, and if fences have to be built at the grounds, then
that will happen. It is one of the options we will consider.''
Yesterday, Walker maintained: ''It would be absurd if these people who
caused the trouble in Dublin are allowed to dictate our lives.
''It would be wrong to allow the organised hooligans to change the
venue of the European Championship. I do believe that the trouble in
Dublin was organised, and I also believe that the people involved are
not football supporters. I will be visiting the various grounds in
England next week to check that all of them are up to UEFA standards,
and part of my brief is to look at security.
''I do not see UEFA changing the venue of the championships. These
people looked on Dublin as a soft target, and that will not, and cannot
be the case in England in l996.''
England has been given worldwide approval to defy the thugs and stage
the championships. Prime Minister John Major, and Joao Havalange,
president of football's world governing body, FIFA, united yesterday to
back the FA's message of not surrendering to the hooligans.
FIFA chief Havalange said: ''England does not deserve, because of a
local problem, to have a sporting right withdrawn.''
UEFA, however, will not rubber-stamp England's continuance as 1996
hosts until it has received and scrutinised reports on the riot from the
FA and Football Association of Ireland's joint inquiry.
But president Lennart Johannsen and general secretary Gerhard Aigner
have both indicated their sympathy. Chief executive Graham Kelly said:
''We are very heartened by the support we have received right across the
board.''
Meanwhile, Ernie Walker's views will be accepted when UEFA meet next
week. The former SFA supremo said: ''There will be no hysterical
reaction. We won't give in to these people.''
And at Park Gardens, SFA Chief Executive Jim Farry added: ''We want
England to play at the new Hampden in l997. The invitation has gone out,
it has been accepted, and it remains in place.
''We will welcome the footballers of England just as we would hope our
own players would be welcomed in the south.''
The English last night called on genuine supporters to turn in the
thugs and help them to save the 1996 European Championships.
The FA, still reeling from the Dublin riot and abandonment of
England's friendly against the Republic, have set up a free hotline --
0800 515495 -- to help to identify the troublemakers.
FA officials have remained in Dublin to pursue the joint inquiry which
is hoped to reach initial conclusions next week. ''It's urgent that we
know what happened and why it happened,'' said David Davies, the FA,'s
director of public affairs.
Glen Kirton, director of Euro 96, pledged that no-one identified or
convicted as a troublemaker will be able to purchase tickets for the
finals.
He added: ''What happened will add to the store of knowledge we and
the police already have of the way this tiny minority operate. What it
is not going to do is change the overall structure of what we do.''
But first comes the inquiry into how a small core of suspected
politically-motivated thugs infiltrated the England Travel Club Section.
Davies revealed that the FA had sent back around 800 of the 2500
tickets it received from the Irish.
The FA also faces some heartsearching over next October's friendly
against Norway in Oslo, their next senior away game, and -- ironically
-- an under-21 UEFA Championship qualifier against the Republic in Cork
next month.
And the FA are naturally worried about the resumption of European club
competitions, with Arsenal due in France and Chelsea in Belgium.
Graham Kelly added: ''We will be talking to the clubs, but we have had
a very successful record since we went back into Europe and we want to
retain that.''

DREW Docherty will tonight take his newly-found confidence into the
ring at The Tryst in Cumbernauld, and the likeable young man from the
village of Condorrat is convinced he can take the World Boxing
Organisation bantamweight championship from Alfred ''The Cobra'' Kotey.
Docherty freely admits that, despite having an abundance of talent, he
was never the most confident of boxers, but all that has changed since
he won outright ownership of a Lonsdale Belt after successfully
defending his British title against Ady Benton last November.
The Scot is still the most modest of men, but he no longer
underestimates his own capabilities. ''Kotey has lost only once and that
says a lot,'' said Docherty. ''However, you could say the same about me.
''The only time I have lost as a pro was when challenging Vincenzo
Belcastro for the European title. I didn't get the decison that night,
but I know what went wrong -- I used the wrong tactics.
''That was the lowest point in my career and I certainly don't want my
family to have to go through anything similar tomorrow night.''
So how come the new confidence from a man who would rather keep in the
background but realises his responsibility to cooperate fully with the
media? ''When I signed up with Tommy Gilmour, he promised me title
fights and said the rest would be up to me,'' said Docherty.
''He was as good as his word, and when I won the British title by
beating Joe Kelly and was presented with the Lonsdale Belt, I wanted
nothing more than to win it outright. It became a burning ambition.
''I then successfully defended against Donnie Hood, and after that
came the big one against Ady Benton. Now, no matter what happens, I have
that belt as tangible proof that I achieved something worthwhile.
''Mind you, my burning ambition now is to become world champion, and
that means beating Kotey.''
Ghanaian Kotey, who took up the sport at the age of seven -- when a
boxing coach watched him get involved in a punch-up during a football
match -- won the title in London last July by beating Puerto Rico's
Rafael del Valle and has made one successful defence against Armando
Castro.Both were points victories.
It should be a fight for the purists. Both are excellent boxers who
are in top condition -- Docherty was bang on the championship limit of
8st 6lb at last night's weigh-in while Kotey scaled 8st 5lb 4oz -- and I
think the judges will be called on at the end of 12 rounds.
One of the judges is Jean Williams, from Atlantic City in New Jersey,
who will make a little bit of history by becoming the first woman to
officiate at a boxing match in Scotland.
On the undercard, Tranent super-middleweight Willie Quinn should
extend his winning run when he meets Martin Jolly, of Alfreton, while
Cumbernauld's Alan Peacock should give the locals a win when he meets
Hartlepool light-welter Kevin McKenzie.
There will be a lot of interest in Nigerian heavyweight Richard Bango.
The 6ft 5in boxer, who won a silver medal at the Barcelona Olympics,
goes in against Denis Bailey, of Liverpool. Other bouts:
Bantam -- Spencer Oliver (London) v Des Gargano (Manchester). Feather
-- Dean Pithy (Coventry) v Kid McAuley (Doncaster). Super-feather --
Hugh Collins (Stirling) v Paul Wynn (Newcastle).

JOHN Higgins took just 75 minutes to beat Ken Doherty
5-0 in the third round of the Sweater Shop Open at Bournemouth
yesterday.
And then Mark Johnston-Allen beat new Benson &amp; Hedges Masters champion
Ronnie O'Sullivan 5-2 just 48 hours after his shock 5-4 victory over
world champion Stephen Hendry.
The former public schoolboy from Bristol now goes for a hat trick
today against Jimmy White in the quarter-finals of the #325,000 event.
Scot Higgins produced a fine display of potting, starting with two
century breaks, as he inflicted on world No.7 Doherty the heaviest
defeat of his professional career.
Higgins, beaten by O'Sullivan in the final of the Benson and Hedges
Masters at Wembley, said: ''That's the best I've played against a top
player. I'm on a high and feel as if all the luck is going my way.''
The 19-year-old from Wishaw started with a break of 106 in 10 minutes
and followed-up with a 101 in the second frame.
Doherty, 25, said: 0''It's the first time I've been whitewashed in a
ranking tournament, but there was nothing I could do about it.''
Higgins now faces fellow-Scot Euan Henderson, the world No.119 from
Glenrothes, who continued his giant-killing run when he beat 1979 world
champion Terry Griffiths 5-2 to qualify for the quarter-finals of a
major tournament for the first time.
Henderson knocked out another former world champion, Dennis Taylor,
after having beaten world No.3 James Wattana in the first round. He is
now guaranteed at least #9050.
Steve Davis beat Peter Ebdon for the second time in 19 days -- then
tipped him as a future world champion. Davis, six times world and UK
title winner, won 5-2.
Ebdon was shattered by his seventh defeat against Davis in their nine
matches, but he will have been lifted by Davis's words. ''He has the
qualities and heart to win the world title,'' said the 37-year-old.
Davis now meets Nuneaton's Mick Price for the first time in the last
eight. After having notched his third successive
5-1 victory against Welsh left-hander Darren Morgan, Price, 27, said:
''It's a dream draw.''
John Parrott, holder of the title, eased into the quarter-finals by
beating Canadian Alain Robidoux 5-2, and now meets Glasgow's Alan
McManus for a place in the last four.
McManus, the world No.6, also enjoyed an easy passage, beating
Grimsby's Mike Hallett 5-1.

SCOTLAND'S record-breaking sprinter, Melanie Neef, seems fated in her
attempt to find opposition which will fully test her burgeoning 400
metres talents.
Denied a race against Olympic, World, European, and Commonwealth 400m
hurdles champion Sally Gunnell last weekend, when Britain met France in
Glasgow, Neef is now to miss Gunnell's challenge for the second time.
Gunnell has pulled out of the KP invitation meeting in Birmingham a
week tomorrow, because a heel injury is taking longer to clear than she
anticipated, and she will not contest any event during the indoor
season.
Neef says a calf muscle strain is making progress and she is confident
of being fit to face a world-class field which will include Jamaican
Sandie Richards, Commonwealth bronze medallist ahead of her in Victoria.
Brian Whittle won a 400m international race in Moscow on Tuesday with
47.29. His victims included Dmitriy Golovastov, the Russian who blocked,
then beat him, in Glasgow.
* JOHN Regis's time of 20.46sec indoors in Stuttgart a week past
Sunday will not after all be recognised as a UK 200m record, because the
race had just one other person in it.
Under international and UK rules, a minimum of three competitors are
required before a record can be ratified. The race was a heat, from
which a third runner withdrew -- a similar situation to that which cost
Mel Neef a Scottish record at the Kelvin Hall last month. Neef was
fortunate enough to break the record again in the final.
* SELECTION for the World outdoor championships, in Gothenburg in
August, will be guaranteed to all winners of AAA championship titles,
provided they have achieved the required standard. The selectors will
choose up to two more per event.
*THREE Scottish age-group record breakers -- sprinters Allan McBride
and Kris Stewart, and high jumper Scott Kenny -- are included in the
Scottish Schools TSB-backed team for the under-16 international in
Birmingham a week on Sunday. Team (women in italics):
60m hurdles: G Stewart (Tynecastle HS), C Low (Carnoustie HS). 60m: K
Scott (Douglas Ewart HS), A McBride (Notre Dame, Greenock). 200m: P
Thomson (St George's), McBride. 300/400m: L Philp (Webster's HS), K
Stewart (Berwickshire HS). 800m: K Montador (Alloa Acad.), J Hand (St
Thomas of Aquins). 1500m: J Ross (Boclair Acad.), C Menelaws (Uddingston
GS). High jump: G Black (Castlehead HS), S Kenny (King's Park Sec.).
Long jump: L Whigham (Lenzie Acad.), N Ritchie (Morgan Acad). Shot: I
Swan (Selkirk HS), G Allan (Milne's HS). Triple jump: R McDonald (Perth
HS). Pole vault: C Rule (Edinburgh Acad.) 4 x 200m from: L Callan (St

IT needs a big story to deprive Ron Atkinson of the back page lead in
English newspapers, but even he had to give way to the disgraceful
nonsense in Dublin. Otherwise, this remarkable example of survival in
the toughest business of all, football management, would have held
princely court as per habit.
His appointment by Coventry City is the ninth time the man with an
all-year tan, heavyweight jewellery, and the immense self-confidence has
been appointed manager of a club.
That in itself is a testament to his ability to convince the world
that he succeeds even when he apparently fails. This is a special
talent, a gift that is at the core of all survivors in most businesses.
The bearing is much to do with it. Atkinson never actually looks like a
man who has got it wrong, even when he has. This is known as the
chameleon factor.
Just when you think he has gone and done it this time, he pops up
wearing a different shirt, fresh smile, and that self-assured attitude
which instantly erases the lurking thought that, if this is his ninth
attempt, is it not time he got it right?
Yet it would be unfair to apply that kind of rationale to the
impossible challenge of football management. Sometimes, they manage to
get it right and wrong at the same club. Billy McNeill was a conquering
hero when he returned to Celtic and won the double in 1988. When he was
dismissed four years later many of his former admirers believed he had
lost his touch.
Howard Kendall could not seem to do anything right at Everton for
years and then his painstaking planning finally came good, and the club
was off winning the league and the cup.
Alex Ferguson, Atkinson's successor at Old Trafford, was pilloried
mercilessly in the early years with Manchester United, before he sent
the critics scurrying into the trees.
The truth probably is that most of the survivors in the management
game are good at what they do, but are faced by so many unforeseeable
factors in football that it can often be beyond any man's capabilities
to influence its course.
Which is why, by his very presence, Atkinson proves he is good at it.
One of the multitude of diverse talents the job requires is the ability
to stay the trip. Endurance under all kinds of external and internal
pressure is imperative, and many of those who have fallen by the wayside
and re-entered civilisation were not equipped with the kind of
resilience which can withstand abuse of the most vitriolic kind.
''Atko'' has done it again. He deserves congratulations and maybe he
will fulfil the promise that he has managed at other clubs, win a trophy
for Coventry.
The former manager of Manchester United, Aston Villa, and others has
proved once again that, in fooball as in life, last week's losers are
next week's winners.
* NOT that it happens very often but I have made ita policy not to
accept invitaions to play in pro-am golf tournaments. This is not
because of a terror of embarrassing my partners to the point of making
their excuses and leaving - which could happen - but because of an
in-built fear that I might cause serious injury somewhere ariund the
course. Let me point out that when it comes to straight driving I am
better than the next man but when you stand on a tee confronted by a few
celebrity spotters baffled b y a) your presence and b) your swing it can
be extremely intimidating. The normally slow, precise and beautiful
movements can be transformed into something akin to a break dancer on
crack and the ball, if hit at all, can go anywhere.
Which is why I have some sympathy with the ex-president of the US,
whose wayward fairway wood cannoned off a tree and hit a spectator on
the head at Palm Springs this week.(''I look up and see smiling faces
and I wonder how I am going to miss them.'') BUsh is reputedly not bad
at the game, unlike one of his partners this week, another former
president, Gerald Ford, who in his hey day, it was said, could hit
anything bar the fairway from twenty yards.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns revealed yesterday that he has started
contract negotiations with five of his first-team squad -- club captain
Paul McStay, Tony Mowbray, Brian O'Neil, Charlie Nicholas and Jim
Slavin.
All are out of contract in the summer, and Burns said: ''I have
started talks with all of the players and we are relaxed about the
situation, although we don't want any long, drawn out negotiations.''
Burns may be relaxed about the re-signing situation, but he admits to
certain worries over tomorrow's Scottish Cup clash with Meadowbank
Thistle.
''We have had them watched and they will make us work hard,'' said
Burns. ''They will be well organised and it is a game we have to take
very seriously.''
The Celtic manager would not say whether McStay will return after
having been axed from the side which drew with Hibs last weekend. All he
would say was: ''We will be looking at the team selection, but nothing
has been decided. We do have a couple of knocks and also two players who
are suspended.'' The players who are out because of suspension are Tom
Boyd and young centre half Jim Slavin.
Celtic, of course, are looking at the Scottish Cup as the most likely
entry to European football next season, and Dutch striker Pierre van
Hooydonk agrees with that.
''I want to win something here in Scotland and the cup, because of the
number of games involved, is possibly the easiest trophy to win in
Scotland,'' insisted van Hooydonk. ''It is certainly my target.
''It will not be as easy as many people think to win on Saturday, but
we have to do it, and hopefully we will be scoring more goals than
normal. The supporters will want that -- and we have to give them what
they want.''
* ARBROATH have moved quickly to sign former Aberdeen player Ian
Porteous, who scored twice for them as a trialist in Wednesday night's
3-1 win over Queen's Park.
Manager John Brogan revealed that it was one of his former players at
Stirling Albion, Willie Watters, who had alerted him that Elgin City had
freed Porteous. ''Willie is a friend of Ian's and he tipped us off.''

''WHO played the best of the three presidents?'' Scott Hoch was asked
after the holder had partnered Bill Clinton (11-handicap), and George
Bush and Gerald Ford (both 18), in the opening round of the five-day Bob
Hope Chrysler classic at Indian Wells.
''I think it would have to be Mr Bush, although Mr Clinton hit some
good drives and Mr Ford holed a 30-footer for par on the ninth green,''
said the little North Carolinian who failed to hole a two-and-a-half
footer to win the 1989 US Masters and then lost the play-off to Nick
Faldo.
The presidents improved Hoch's 70 by eight strokes for their
better-ball -- 10 behind the top team -- with Bush's card at 92,
Clinton's 94, and Ford's 102. One hundred US Marines were on duty plus
about 40 secret servicemen.
Four spectators were hit by their balls, the worst injured being
71-year-old Nancy Earley who was hit on the forehead when Bush's ball
ricocheted off a tree at the first.
She needed 10 stitches in the wound, but said: ''I told theformer
president I was sorry I had got in the way of his shot.''
Kenny Perry, 34, of Kentucky, led with 63 on his first round at Indian
Ridge.

moderate success on the Australian Tour in recent years.
Tom Watson, Robert Allenby and Peter Senior finished one shot adrift
of the leaders, while former US PGA champion John Daly took 71.
Watson said he was heartened by his form on the greens. ''That's the
best round I've putted this year,'' said the former British and US Open
champion.
Daly, who was disqualified from this event three years ago for failing
to sign his card, dropped two shots over the final three holes. Leading
scores (Australian unless otherwise stated):

ERNIE Els twice claimed line-of-sight relief en route to his US Open
success at Oakmont last June, when he defeated Colin Montgomerie and
Loren Roberts in a play-off.
The talented Springbok used his knowledge of the rule book to claim
relief from a huge TV tower and was able to escape with impunity and go
on to record a memorable success.
Back home in Johannesburg yesterday he again kept his cool in the 90
degree heat when, playing his last hole of the first round of the
Lexington South African PGA Championship, he hooked his approach shot
behind a sponsor's scoreboard. And that's when real trouble could have
overtaken him.
This week's event is the first to be co-sponsored by the PGA European
Tour and the South African PGA, and it is standard procedure on the Euro
Tour when a ball finishes behind a similar obstruction to claim a free
drop. But below the equator they do things differently.
South African professionals first have to play the ball as it lies --
and only then, if they hit the obstruction, are they entitled to claim
relief, without penalty.
But Ernie had done his homework and played the game according to the
European rules, not those of his native country. Had he not done so, he
might well have found himself disqualified, according to tournament
director Andy McFee.
''This problem highlights the debates which have been on-going between
the European Tour and other governing bodies round the world,'' said
McFee. ''Our belief is that a player should know exactly what to do
whether he is in Arizona, Yorkshire, South Africa, or the Northern
Territories of Australia. They should all be playing under the same
rules.''
McFee added he had sent warning letters to all 70-plus of the European
contingent playing this week as well as posting the rule change on every
player's locker door.
Els eventually escaped with a birdie 3 and his 65 put him three behind
Wayne Westner, who shot six birdies and an eagle. His 62 was one short
of Fulton Allem's three-year-old course record, but 10 strokes better
than Dean Robertson's opener yesterday.
Leading British player is young Englishman Van Phillips with 66, eight
better than Scottish champion Andrew Coltart.
Old-timer Bill Longmuir had planned to hang a Gone Fishin' sign on the
door of his Nairobi holiday home this week, but responded to a late call
to Johannesburg with a 72.
(South African unless otherwise stated)
62 -- W Westner.
65 -- E Els.
66 -- Van Phillips (England), T Dodds (Namibia), A Cejka (Germany), R
Whittaker (USA).
67 -- J Townsend (USA).
68 -- J Johnson (USA), W Bradley, M Board (USA), W Schutte, B Lincoln,
T Johnstone (Zimbabwe), M McNulty, J Hodgson (England), R Wessels.
69 -- F Quinn (USA), I Spencer (England), G Reid, N Henning, D Carter
(England) S van Vurren, D Pappas, V van Rensburg, R Stewart, J McHenry
(Ireland).
70 -- M Farry (France), J Mellor (England), M Harwood (Australia), M
Archer (England), R Walker (England), W Riley (Australia), F Nobilo (New
Zealand), D Frost, R Fletcher.
71 -- S van Merwe, M Green, D Edlund (Sweden), C Whitelaw, C Williams
(England), J Hawkes, M James (England), S Dunlap (USA), R Kaplan, M
Wiltshire, O Rohan (Norway), I Leggatt (Canada), M Jonzon (Sweden), J

TOMMY Armour III, the broad-shouldered 35-year-old grandson of the
celebrated Silver Scot who won the US Open at Oakmont in 1927, scored a
67 in sweltering sunshine at Bermuda Dunes to take the early lead on an
11-under-par 133 in the second round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic
yesterday at Indian Wells.
Out on the course, a little-known Tennessee pro Harry Taylor, 40, was
out in 31 at Indian Ridge and was back in 33 for a 64 to lead by three.
But for a moment it was glory for Armour, who has had a chequered
career since winning his only tournament, the Phoenix Open in 1990.
Armour finished a lowly 147th on the money list last season, but
gained entry into this tournament by finishing seventh on the Nike Tour.
He left it to his second nine to make his charge into the lead and
gained it with a wonderful eagle 3 at the 540-yard seventeenth with a
big drive, a No.3 wood and a 20-foot putt. He had a long wait to see if
the little known Taylor could beat him by a stroke or two. Leading
scores:
130 -- H Taylor 66, 64.
133 -- T Armour 66, 67; C Perry 66, 67.
134 -- R Freeman 64, 70; K Perry 63, 71; K Fergus 65, 69; M Wurtz 67,
67; J Acosta 66, 68.
Others included: 136 -- F Zoeller 68, 68; J Leonard 68, 68. 139 -- S
Hoch 70, 69. 148 -- A Palmer 77, 72.

THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry continues to take a positive
view of the outlook for the UK economy and said a further interest rate
rise does not look justified in anti-inflation terms. It said a Cabinet
ceasefire on the single currency would be a better response to market
uncertainty.
Speaking at the Guildhall in London yesterday, director-general Howard
Davies said that despite rising headline inflation, and softening of
retail demand, the recovery remains soundly based.
''The financial markets have clearly been unsettled by this week's
economic news, and perhaps by political uncertainty too, but there is no
cause for alarm,'' said Mr Davies.
He added: ''We had expected that growth in 1995 would not match the
pace of 1994. The second phase of tax increases is bound to have an
effect, as is the rise in interest rates we have seen so far. The
expectations are built into the CBI forecast of around 3% growth this
year.''
On inflation, Mr Davies said that ''while there are undoubtedly
continued pressures in industry, driven largely by rises in raw material
prices, we do not expect inflation to move out of the 1% to 4% band. The
most recent figures show that the rate of increase in raw material
prices is reducing in most areas.''
''Output expectations remain strong, particularly for companies well
established in export markets. And our invisibles performance is
particularly strong with a sizeable surplus emerging at the end of last
year.''
Mr Davies did, though, single out investment as the ''fly in the
ointment.'' Investment intentions remain weak, he said, adding, ''that
is why we hope the authorities will not react to market uncertainty with
another interest rate rise which does not look justified in
anti-inflation terms.''
He said: ''It is hard to avoid the conclusion that political
uncertainty is a contributory factor in the market's nervousness. A
Cabinet ceasefire on the single currency, therefore, would be a better
response than a rise in interest rates.''

SCOTTISH clubs with hopes of doing well in Europe next season will not
be helped by the Scottish League when they prepare for their preliminary
ties in the major competitions.
As was the case last summer, the teams will go into their opening,
often crucial matches without the benefit of a domestic game as a
warm-up.
Next season will open with Coca-Cola Cup, first-round games -- not
involving any of the top sides -- on August 5.
The following week the European tournaments kick-off.
On August 12 the premier-division programme has been abandoned because
Scotland meet Greece in a European Championship qualifier at Hampden a
few days later.
League secretary Peter Donald said yesterday: ''I have no doubt that
the major clubs will prepare for the European games by organising
friendly games or taking part in tournaments.''
* THE fee for Hearts' midfielder Brian Hamilton, who left Easter Road
to cross the city and join up at Tynecastle, will be settled by a
transfer tribunal which will sit on March 2.

KENNY Milne is the boss card in the Scottish pack. The 33-times capped
hooker will be the most senior Scotland forward on duty at Parc des
Princes tomorrow as the Scots seek to exorcise the spectre of 26 years
in the French capital without a win.
The Scottish side arrived in Paris last night confident that they can
confound the critics who say that they stand no chance of beating the
Parc des Princes hoodoo, and laying to rest the grim statistic of not
having won on French soil since 1969.
Captain Gavin Hastings, who wins his fifty-fourth cap, declared that
his side can build on the two victories against Canada and Ireland,
although they were not under-estimating the magnitude of the task which
faces them. Hastings added: ''If we play the kind of rugby which I truly
believe this side is capable of, then a victory is not beyond us.''
Milne, as a senior player, will be expected to give a lead to the
youngsters in the side for whom that first exposure to the often
volcanic atmosphere at the Parc could be an unnerving experience.
He makes his fourth visit to Paris, and plays against the French for
the seventh time. He is no stranger to what euphemistically is described
as the French ''streetwise'' ways.
''They will be up to all of their usual tricks. They'll pull a jersey
when you're chasing the ball, and that kind of thing,'' he says.
''For the guys who have never been there before, it will come as a bit
of a shock. But we have to make sure that those who are new to Paris
know just what to expect.
''But we have no reason to fear them. We have to go out there and play
our own game. We have to take play to the French. We must not let them
get into any kind of rhythm, and we certainly must not allow them to
intimidate us.''
There is a precarious path to be trodden here by the Scots. The
sidelined Gary Armstrong recalls how, in his first encounter with the
French in Paris, the side had allowed themselves to be intimidated and
lost 19-3.
Two years later, in 1991, the side had been well and truly psyched-up
by the time they burst from the Parc's dressing room. The result was an
over-eager Scottish side who gave away too many penalties and, for
Armstrong, it led to an uncharacteristic bout of all-in-wrestling with
French captain, Serge Blanco.
Tomorrow, Milne expects the Frenchmen to play with the usual passion
and commitment that they always display on their own turf.
''You find France a different breed on their own patch. The amazing
support they receive is a major factor. It was the same for us against
England during the Grand Slam match at Murrayfield in 1990. The crowd
that day was tremendous and it made us all go the extra yard,'' he said.
Milne knows little about his opposite number, Jean-Michel Gonzales.
''I don't think I've played against him before, but he looks strong. The
French are usually competent in the scrummage. They play a high grade of
club rugby.''
He reckons, though, that the key men for the French will be their
back-row. Benezzi, Cabbanes, and Benetton. The French like nothing more
than conjuring tries seemingly from thin air, and the back-row men are
the conduits for transforming no-hope broken-play situations into
breathtaking tries.
Milne observed: ''They like to set up those mini-rucks, and if they
are allowed to get into their stride, then they can be quite formidable.
We have to put the first-time tackles in and really make them count.''
The Scotland hooker knows that he is under threat from the Scotland A
captain, Kevin McKenzie, who sits on the bench in Paris. Manager Duncan
Paterson let it be known as the team for Paris was announced that he
reckoned McKenzie's time in the full side would come.
Milne, though, will not give up his place without a fight and as the
senior forward, he will try to give a lead in Paris.
He said: ''Kevin is desperate to get into the side. He has his
strengths and weaknesses as I do, but I still reckon I'm a better
player. I was a bit down ater the South Africa game at the end of last
year, but I think I had a good district championship campaign, and I was
quite satisfied with the way that I played against Canada and Ireland. I
did the basic chores, I was quite satisfied with my performance.''
The Scots, with just one Five Nations' game behind them, are in second
place in the championship behind England, who play their third game
against Wales in Cardiff tomorrow.
Final preparations for the game against France take place today when
the Scots will hold a public training session at the US Maison-Laffittee
ground on the outskirts of Paris.
* SCOTLAND'S Under-21 side take on their French counterparts in a
floodlit game at Evry Stadium, near Paris, tonight.
The Scots have not won a game since the 22-6 encounter with Italy in
1986. Last year, at Inverleith, they went down 21-12 to France, but two
years ago in Dijon, they were swamped 67-9, and manager David Leslie
knows how difficult his young side's task will be tonight.
Scotland Under-21 -- P W B Flockhart (Stewart's-Melville FP); H R
Gilmour (Heriot's FP), R N C Brown (Melrose), M N McGrandles (Stirling
County), C A Murray (Hawick); B R Easson (Boroughmuir), E J W Weston
(Watsonians); M H McCluskie (Edinburgh Academicals), N R B Dickson

WALES skipper Ieuan Evans yesterday uttered the dreaded ''C-word'' --
that's Cardiff to you -- in the latest shot in the psychological battle
before the clash with England.
Evans reckoned England's miserable record at Cardiff Arms Park again
could be a factor, as it was when Wales pulled off an unexpected triumph
two years ago.
Then England were expected to steamroller the Welsh, but slipped to a
10-9 defeat after the Llanelli wing pounced on an error by his opposite
number, Rory Underwood, to score the winning try.
''I certainly hope their record in Cardiff will be a factor,''
admitted Evans, who will lead out Wales and complete his top-flight
comeback after a five-month battle for fitness following a broken ankle.
''The atmosphere in the stadium two years ago was something
special.The crowd feed off us as much as we feed off them.''
Saturday will be the fiftieth time England have played on Welsh soil,
with the first game in 1882. In that time, they have won only 14 and
drawn four.
At the Arms Park, England's record is even worse, with just eight wins
from 33 attempts and only one success since 1963. And England have
managed just one try on their last four visits.
But the Wales management will warn their players to forget the
statistics as they attempt to stop England taking a third step towards
another Grand Slam following the victories over Ireland and France.

THE DEMAND for private nursing home places continues to grow rapidly
with independent estimates of a requirement to build around 100,000 new
and replacement care home beds by the year 2000.
Although the nursing home industry remains highly fragmented,
corporate operators of large numbers of homes are increasing their
market share as they construct purpose-built premises and win Care in
the Community contracts with local authorities.
Westminster Health Care is one such company benefiting from the
commercialisation of private nursing care for the elderly. It operates
at the upper end of the market, offering single en-suite rooms to both
privately and publicly financed residents.
In the six months to 30 November 1994, pre-tax profits rose by 21% to
#6.3m on turnover up by 37% to #32.7m. Earnings per share grew by 18.6%
to 10.2p and the interim dividend per share was raised by 20% to 2.1p.
Overall occupancy levels in its homes remained steady at 92% although
in some areas where local authorities have experienced financing
problems, referrals have slowed down and occupancy levels have fallen to
the mid-1980s level. However, this has been offset by faster occupancy
rates in other areas.
Trading in the second half of the year is said to have started well
and the company has identified good opportunities for further growth.
Chief executive Pat Carter noted that at more than 1400 beds the company
had comfortably exceeded its target of beds in operations since
flotation.
The total number of homes in operation is 65 -- including 12 in
Scotland -- and another 11 homes are under construction in the UK
including a site at Dunfermline. Further sites have been earmarked for
development through to 1997.
The company denied rumours yesterday that it did not announce a rights
issue because of financial problems. Westminster said the timing was not
right even though it had received strong support from institutions.
The company emphasised that it had sufficient existing bank facilities
to finance current expansion plans although it is actively considering
other external forms of financing such as sale and leaseback deals. Its
development programme to date has been financed from existing banking
facilities and net debt at the half year-end was #44m, representing
gearing of 46%.
However, the possibility of a rights issue and a marginal reduction in
the 42% stake held by US shareholder National Medicine Enterprise
overshadowed the strong trading performance and the shares dropped 38p
to 293p.

Council Development and Industry's latest annual trade mission to Japan
-- twice the level secured the previous year.
Figures released this week reveal that 30 Scottish companies did more
than #1.1m of business during the week-long visit in November, with
another #2.95m of completely new business and #6.05m of continuing
business with existing contacts expected in the short to medium-term.
The total for the previous year was nearly #5m.
SCDI mission manager Les Young, who was on the trip, said: ''It is an
excellent achievement in a very difficult market 6000 miles away.''
Compared with the rest of the UK, the level of Scottish exports to
Japan is disproportionately high. Japan is Scotland's sixth largest
market, with exports totalling #453m in 1993/94.
The delegation, including Glasgow engineering firm Begg Cousland and
patent agent Murgitroyd, consisted mainly of small and medium-sized
companies.
Orkney-based Judith Glue, who designs and produces knitwear, was
delighted with her firm's success on its first visit to Japan.
Mr Young, who was pleasantly surprised by the success of the mission,
said: ''Japan is not a market where you tend to go out for the first
time and sell very easily.''
The strength of the yen continues to make it relatively cheap for the
Japanese to buy goods from abroad. The country's recession has also
produced something of a sea change in attitude, with the Japanese now
focusing on value for money.

IAN Jennings, who has helped Scottish side MIM and England's St Albans
qualify for this weekend's finals of hockey's European Indoor Cup, will
not play against MIM in the event, writes Joseph Dillon.
Jennings, player/coach with Gilford, must return south for a league
match and so will miss out on a possible meeting with MIM in the
knock-out stages. St Albans German player Henning Tewes also will make a
swift departure from Edinburgh because of an engagement with Oxford
University.
Jennings claims that St Albans' strategy is ''to win our group in the
course of tonight and tomorrow and so avoid MIM in the semi-final, and
then, hopefully, get an easier tie on Sunday. This means that the boys
will be able to go on and qualify for the final, which will be enough to
let Old Loughtonians win promotion to the A Division of the championship
next year.''
This leaves too much to chance, for if St Albans avoid MIM, the
Slovakian side, Raca, and Olten, from Switzerland, may carry as much a
threat.
MIM begin their campaign tonight against Avoca Mazda, from Ireland,
and with Jonathan Smyth fit after injury, this match should be a mere
stepping stone to top ranking in their group, and eventually the gold
medals come Sunday. Today's games are:
Raca v Olten 4pm, Royal White Star v Jedinstvo 5pm, MIM v Avoca Mazda
6pm, St Albans v Stockholm 7pm.
* THE European Hockey Federation has based the groupings for the
finals of the European nations mens' outdoor cup in Dublin on April 16
to 27 on current ratings, and so Scotland has a fine opportunity of
qualifying for the semi-final stage.
They have been drawn in Group B with Holland, Spain, Belgium, Wales,
and France. Group A is made up of Germany (holders), England, Ireland,
Belarus, Switzerland, and Poland.

EDINBURGH Ladies, in Germany this weekend for the finals of the A
Division in the European club championship, are out to improve on the
bronze medal they won in the event last year, writes Joseph Dillon.
And their prospects look good. Russelsheim are the only German side in
the event this time, which means that the silver-medal position is
available. However, the Edinburgh team have been drawn in the stronger
of the two groups.
Their early target will be to win their group and in that way avoid
Russelsheim in the semi-finals.
''This gives us a better chance of reaching the final,'' said top goal
scorer Sharon Bissett, ''for I feel we can beat any of the three other
sides in the German's group.''
The emergence of Bissett as leading scorer has come against the law of
averages. She has been relegated from the starting six this year,
something which she is ''hacked off about,'' but it has made her even
more determined when she gets on court.
Edinburgh's group opponents are Valdeluz (Spain), Victoria (Holland),
and the English side, Slough. These are three good teams and any one
could provide an upset, with the Spaniards giving Bissett cause for
concern.
''Some of the girls,'' she said, ''are worried about Slough but I fear
Valdeluz, for their national team deprived Scotland of a place in the
1990 finals of the European Nations' Cup.''
Edinburgh get an early opportunity to find out the strengths of the
Spaniards. The teams clash in the opening series of games this evening.
On form, Edinburgh should do well and go on to win their group to put
them into a semi-final meeting with possibly Stade from Frances.

THE sheep industry has been challenged to improve the image of lamb if
it is to gain a greater share of the meat market.
James Warnock, chairman of the British Texel Sheep Society, which is
celebrating its 21st anniversary, says that everyone involved in the
production chain -- breeders, finishers, wholesalers and retailers --
must face up to the need for major improvements.
''It is up to all of us to promote lamb. It has a great reputation as
a natural tasty meat produced from grass, its image unclouded by
concerns over welfare or intensive systems.
''It warrants a concerted campaign to promote lamb's healthy
nutritional attributes to today's cholesterol conscious consumer.
''Perhaps the word lamb, considered by some to be emotive, should be
dropped in favour of brand or breed names.''
Mr Warnock said that vital statistics did not make good reading. Lamb
accounting for only 10% of the total meat and poultry consumed in the UK
and in France, a vital export market, it was only five per cent.
He said farmers must stop producing over-fat lambs with barely visible
eye muscles and should concentrate on the lean, muscular lambs wanted by
supermarkets, exporters and the convenience food sector.
''The saleable yield of meat from a beef carcase is between 70-73%,
from a pork carcase around 70% while the average lamb is just over 50%.
Clearly sheep producers have a lot to do if they are to move their
product up the league table and they need look no further than the
cattle industry for their first lesson.''
He points out that a growing number of beef animals are now
three-quarter bred or more, the result of an infusion of terminal sire
blood in the female, resulting in improved confirmation, muscling and
lean meat yield giving improved margins for both buyer and seller.
''The sheep industry must follow suit to increase the lamb's depth of
flesh, to breed lambs with broad backs, clean middles, wide, deep
hindquarters and a minimum of fat cover.''
Breeders must also eliminate the use of inferior crossing rams.
The Texel Sheep Society anniversary programme includes a weekend
conference and sale at Peebles on November 10-12

DEBBIE Knox was taken to the wire in the Royal Bank of Scotland
Scottish women's championships at Kilmarnock's Galleon Centre yesterday
evening, but after having beaten Kirsty Hay by one shot, Knox was not
complaining.
A fine draw shot gave Knox the one shot she needed for victory in
their second-round game.
But it all could have been different.
It looked as though success had eluded Knox in the tenth end when her
final shot was overswept, but her win by 7-6 followed an earlier defeat
of Carolyn Hutchison by the same score, putting Knox's team at the top
of the rankings.
On the same position is Rhona Martin, who beat Marion Miller by 6-3 in
her opening game, and she followed that win up with a 9-2 victory
against Claire Milne in yesterday evening's play.
Carolyn Hutchison went on to beat Sheila Harvey by 7-6 in the second
round to open her account in the championships, as did Marion Miller,
who beat Margaret Morton by 5-3. Results:
First round -- S Harvey 4, K Hay 11; C Hutchison 6, D Knox 7; R Martin
6, M Miller 3; C Milne 6, M Morton 5.
Second round -- M Miller 5, M Morton 3; R Martin 9, C Milne 2; K Hay
6, D Knox 7; S Harvey 6, C Hutchison 7.
Standings (after two rounds) -- B Knox won 2, lost 0; R Martin, 2-0; K
Hay, 1-1; C Hutchison, 1-1; M Miller, 1-1; C Milne, 1-1; S Harvey, 0-2;
M Morton, 0-2.

IT was a case of ecstasy and agony yesterday for two Scots in the
singles matches at the world indoor championship in Preston, with
Richard Corsie cruising to a world record, straight-sets win over
England's Russell Morgan, while Irvine's Paul Foster was well beaten by
John Price.
Corsie swept Morgan aside 7-0, 7-0, 7-2 in a match that lasted just 49
minutes and 10 ends. That chopped 13 minutes off the previous best time
and trimmed the ends total by two. And for good measure Corsie added a
third world record when he restricted Morgan to just two shots.
The previous best was held by Corsie at three shots after a win over
Welshman Lyn Tanner in 1991.
''I'm not normally too quick a starter,'' said Corsie, ''but I can't
have any complaints today. The problem now is maintaining that sort of
form throughout the championship.''
That win puts Corsie through to a second-round clash on Tuesday with
Australia's Cameron Curtis, also a straight-sets winner over another of
the home contingent, Paul Bennett.
Foster, however, tumbled to a four-set defeat at the hands of 1990
champion Price, who won 7-3, 7-1, 4-7, 7-1. Foster, who claimed his
place in the world championship by coming through the Scottish qualifer,
opted not to avail himself of the practise facilities in the Preston
Guild Hall.
''When I got up this morning I thought about it but I just decided not
to practise,'' said the man from Magnum. Foster got his just rewards
when he was outclassed by the former world champion.
In yesterday' other match, former UK champion Stephen Rees won through
with a 7-2, 7-0, 4-7, 7-5 win over New Zealand's Andrew Curtain.

<HEADLINE>Dairy farms are star performers in Scotland as buyers chase units. Land values surge by 29%</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS, FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>22</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979812493</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
FARMLAND values have risen by 29% in the past 18 months to levels not
seen since ''the heady days of the late 1980's property boom'' and the
tail end of the farm production boom of the 70's and 80's, say Savills
Agricultural Research in their latest briefing.
The figures for Scotland are slightly behind, with a 27.4% increase
over that period. The biggest increase -- 49.8% -- was shown in the East
Midlands of England, followed by the West Midlands at 32%.
Growth has been strongest for good arable land, ranging from 33% to
40% on a Great Britain basis. Dairy land has grown in value by 26% and
poorer grazing by up to 23%.
Farmers buying with the intention of expanding their business have
continued to dominate the market while institutions and companies have
been net sellers.
Jim Ward, head of agricultural research with Savills forecasts that
capital values are likely to be fairly stable this year, perhaps
drifting lower. Towards the end of the decade, he suggests, a fall in
value of between 5% and 17% is in prospect as CAP reforms take effect.
While admitting that predicting long-term changes in the CAP is
''tenuous at best'' he suggests that it seems probable that current
support levels will remain intact for 1996 and 1997. ''By 1998 it is
likely that the pressures for reform will have started to overcome the
inertia of the EU decision-making process. The possibilities are many,
and include capping of area payments and renationalisation of support
payments. In the UK case, this would almost certainly mean lower
payments or higher environmental management requirements and lower net
margins.''
UA Properties, in their review of the Scottish market, say dairy farms
were the star performer in 1994 with large numbers of prospective buyers
chasing a relatively small number of units. Prices in excess of #1600 an
acre -- without quota or milking equipment -- were paid for farms which
could be converted to a dairy unit.
Well equipped grass farms also attracted good levels of interest. One
farm in Fife, without a house, achieved #1400 an acre.
The market for 1995 is said to be showing signs of following last
year's trend with high demand for good quality units. The impending sale
of British Coal holdings to tenants will be seen as an early test.
Non-farming purchasers have already lifted prices in areas which are
''commutable'' -- often beyond the economically viable limit for for
farmers, says UA Properties -- a member of the United Auctions Group.
However, the capital input into the countryside generated by these
purchasers is seen as helping to keep the countryside alive -- by
providing start-up chances for young farmers prepared to rent the land
and job opportunities for grooms and gamekeepers.
''With such a level of genuine interest in the farmland market, the
advice to anyone thinking of selling is to do so now,'' states the
review. ''As the influence of GATT increases and the European CAP is
altered, the future for farming may not be as rosy in the medium term.
However, the longer term outlook is better. As the population and their
appetites grow and the area of land farmed decreases, food production
will become an increasingly prosperous occupation for those competitive
enough to survive free world trade.

THE spring round of pedigree beef cattle sales drew to its conclusion
in Castle Douglas yesterday with the annual Galloway sale. As at so many
other events recently buyers were highly selective but they had good
cause since by general consent the offering was distinctly lacking
quality in depth.
A handful of German enthusiasts were at the ringside and from then
came some prospect of an early resumption of the export trade which a
decade ago put Galloway breeders in clover.
Bertus Johlen, who runs Galloways near Hanover, said: ''It's now
possible that we will be able to get cattle into Germany later this year
especially since the ban on imports of UK beef has been relaxed.'' And
Frau Hanna Mastell, who has bought large numbers in the past at Castle
Douglas bought several heifers yesterday but in the meantime they will
be kept on a farm near Dumfries.
The bull trade was headed at 5500gns for the second prize Adam of
Luchurr by Grange Viceroy from Peter Kennedy Moffat, Lochmailling,
Auldgirth, Dumfries, which sold to Kenneth Lawrie, Snowden Close,
Gillsland, Carlisle, to join his 70 cow herd.
Next best at 4200gns was the reserve overall and senior champion,
Basil of Glenturk by the 9000gns Grange Yeoman from Brian Allan,
Glenturk, Newton Stewart which sold to Gordon Gilligan, High Creoch,
Gatehouse of Fleet, Margaret Gordon, Barfil, Crocketford, Dumfries, and
J G and R Bleazzard, Glenjam, Moniaive.
James Biggar, Grange, Castle Douglas, as ever enjoyed a useful selling
first at 2000gns to George Wilson, Reddings, Moffat, and Neil Manning,
Tweedshaws, Moffat, and then at 2500gns to Robert Brown, Bridgemark,
Dalry, Castle Douglas. M and J Ross, Romesveoch, Dumfries, sold their
reserve junior champion at 2000gns to Tracey Patterson, Kirktonhill,
Lauder, while the supreme champion from Castlemilk Estates, Lockerbie,
was withdrawn at 1200gns.

They had high fresh and dry matter yields, combined with good
emergence, uniformity and vigour. This was despite a dry summer which
depressed yields well below normal levels. Maris Kestrel produced 31.68
tonnes/hectare compared with Bittern at 27.83 t/ha and Hereford at 22.33

LITTLE Jonathan White is trading in his steam train set for the modern
diesel variety after his father discovered that the 60-year-old
locomotive layout is an antique valued at more than #1500.
The four-year-old will wave goodbye for the last time to the Hornby
1930s locomotives, rolling stock, and track when it goes up for sale at
a Perth auctioneer's next week.
The boy's father, Mr Willie White, 39, explained: ''The track used to
belong to me, and my late father Angus before that. But my mother is
moving house and there's no room for it.''
The 60ft of track and its engines, wagons, coaches, and trackside
buildings has been valued at more than #1500.
''It has a lot of sentimental value and I had a lot of fun with the
set when I was a boy. But unfortunately you can't keep things forever.''
Mr White, a restaurateur of Glasgow Road, Perth, said that Jonathan, a
model railway enthusiast, would be getting a modern set to replace the
old line.
He added: ''Jonathan will be sad to part with it, but it was a bit
dated for him. He's very keen on trains and anything mechanical.''
Mr White will attend next week's auction to see how much the train set
realises.

IN sharp contrast to the turmoil at arch rival S G Warburg, Kleinwort
Benson yesterday presented a picture of comparative tranquility with the
securities house reporting a mere #5.5m decline in pre-tax profits to
#97m.
However, the figures were flattered by a #7m clawback on provisions
made the previous year against the fall in values of vacated property
and also a #9.3m writeback of bad debts.
The biggest change was in dealing income which plummeted #60m to #43m
although #36m of the setback took place in the first half.
Chairman Lord Rockley said the favourable market conditions at the
beginning of 1994 were quickly followed by a more testing and uncertain
period across most major markets as the interest rate cycle turned
upwards in the US and the UK.
He added that confidence deteriorated despite improving economic
statistics resulting in unsettled markets worldwide and difficult
trading conditions.
Kleinwort remains prey to recurrent takeover rumours but any predator
would have to pay dearly because the return on capital of 20% is good
going even if it is down on the 24% reported in 1993.
Even if the volatile dealing profits were down, KLeinwort has
benefited from its concentration on specialist areas such as
international privatisations and cross-border mergers and acquisitions.
Funds under management rose 10% to #14.3bn.
Staff increased slightly to 2892 while the average remuneration rose
from #70,950 to #73,500 and probably passing that of Warburg which is
moving in the other direction.
Current year profits should be maintained at around 1994 levels as the
#16.3m of provision writebacks will not recur this time.
Shareholders will be encouraged by the 16% increase in the dividend
total to 21.5p for a 4.25% yield. The shares were 8p easier on the day
at 631p.

STRONG performances from its two newly opened stores in Perth and
Edinburgh has encouraged DIY retailer Wickes to accelerate its expansion
plans in Scotland. Stores are currently under development at Clydebank,
Dundee, and Aberdeen and planning permission is being sought for a
couple of stores in Glasgow.
Chairman Henry Sweetbaum said he believed that ''the Scots are very
receptive to the kind of value we offer''. Wickes has carved a
profitable niche for itself selling good value DIY products at the
structural and necessary end of the market rather than the cosmetic and
decorative end occupied by such companies as Sainsbury's Homebase.
Its focus on offering the lowest prices in the industry is attractive
to cost-conscious consumers and has boosted sales. This is reflected in
the 25% jump in its market share to 6%. Last year, Wickes recorded its
thirteenth consecutive year of record sales and profits.
Its sales jumped by 21% to #733.6m and its pre-tax profits surged by
69% to #30.1m. Earnings per share grew by 33% to 5.6p and the dividend
per share was raised by a generous 80% to 1.8p.
Within the retail business, underlying sales grew by 12%. Sales will
be boosted in the current year by the opening of 25 new stores. Wickes
is now the UK's fourth largest DIY retailer with 95 stores in the UK and
37 on the Continent.
There was good news from the Hunter Timber operation which returned to
profitability with an operating profit of #2.3m compared with a previous
loss of #1.6m. Although Malden Timber remained in loss progress was made
in repositioning the merchanting businesses, which were relaunched last
month under the Builders Mate name.
Wickes and Homebase stand out from the rest of DIY crowd in having a
clear focus on their respective markets and in having remained
profitable throughout the price wars and recession that has affected the
sector. Mr Sweetbaum believes that the proposed Homebase takeover of its
larger rival Texas is ''beneficial to us and beneficial to the market''.
He says that given the different focus of Wickes and Homebase, ''we
trade quite happily next to one another and both of us do well''.
Mr Sweetbaum said the group intended to continue to grow the business
by ''forcing down prices and forcing up value''. Sales in the new
financial year have started well with double digit sales growth
throughout the business in January.
The bumper trading news saw Wickes shares add a penny to 96p.

THE Hong Kong government has so much money it could abolish salary
taxes for the next four years or give each baby born in 1995 a #120,000
start in life, international accounts Price Waterhouse said.
Hong Kong Financial Secretary Hamish Macleod, in his annual budget
speech on March 1, could give each couple getting married in 1995 a
#160,000 wedding present or abolish corporate taxes for two years.
Unfortunately, ''Price Waterhouse confidently predicts that Sir Hamish

NORCROS, the building materials and print and packaging group,
yesterday warned shareholders it expected to report a pre-tax loss for
the year to March 31 after provisions for reorganisation and property
writedowns.
''As a result, the level of the final dividend, if any, will not be
maintained at its previous level,'' added the company, which is based at
Bracknell, Berkshire.
In the previous 12 months it made profits before tax of #17.1m and
paid a final dividend of 3.5p per share.
The reorganisation costs will relate to the building materials
division, where the group said a fundamental review was now taking place
with the aim of restoring its long-term competitiveness.
A provision will also be made in the discontinuing property division
to reduce the book value of its properties to current market value
following recent changes in planning approval relating to the largest
development at Braintree, Essex.
Norcros said the board was also undertaking a major review of the
group's businesses and was in discussions with a number of parties
regarding the potential disposal of some subsidiary companies.

THE current hostile City attitude towards new issues has forced down
the flotation price of chemicals group Albright &amp; Wilson to just 150p
which values the phosphoric acid company at just #470m.
That compares with the #600m expected at the beginning of the year
when a share price of near 200p had been bandied around.
Profits for 1994 amounted to #60.9m or #40.7m after exceptional
rationalisation costs.
At 150p, the shares are being offered at about 10 times current year
earnings which is a 35% discount to the chemicals sector.
Lists close next Friday and dealings begin on March 8.

Ross Finlay tries out the new Ford Escort and finds it to be a vastly
improved and refined car.
BY far the most important thing to bear in mind about the Ford Escort
is that it is the UK's consistent best seller. It has always had its
press critics, who complain that it does not lead the family-car field
in any single aspect of design. This lofty attitude flies in the face of
all the evidence that the Escort package -- including such items as
servicing costs and likely trade-in value -- rings the bell with actual
buyers.
All the same, until now the Escort has seemed to be a lowest common
denominator kind of car. That has changed abruptly with the arrival of
the 1995 model year production. At first glance the latest cars may seem
to be just a revamp, but you can almost see Ford people's eyes bulging
if you use that word. Even a short drive makes it obvious why.
While the body styling remains very much the same, and there are
improvements of various kinds to the interior, Ford has at last let the
real experts loose on the Escort. The same team which, under Richard
Parry-Jones, gave the Mondeo such class-leading standards of handling
and response, has done at least as good a job on the Escort, in terms of
comparison with the models which came before.
I drove a Ghia saloon and estate over a wide variety of terrain in
France, from motorways and city streets to some wiggly and jiggly roads
in the hills. But I had gone only a couple of miles when I realised that
here was a car which, in its general handling, ride quality and noise
suppression, absolutely knocked all previous Escorts into a cocked hat.
Listening to Parry-Jones explaining how his team attacked NVH --
noise, vibration and harshness -- is a mind-boggling experience. It was
by no means just a matter of glueing some extra sound-deadening material
here and sorting out a sealing problem there. This was a really radical
programme, which tracked unnecessary noise and resonance through
suspension units, individual accessory mountings and even the shape of
the sump. The result is a car which is not just the quietest Escort
ever, but is also going to force rival manufacturers to make sure their
own products catch up in this department with the Ford.
The other great improvement is in handling, ride and driveability.
With both cars I tried, I had the impression that there was a lot less
''stiction'' in the steering and suspension. They were lighter to
handle, more responsive and generally just a lot more fun. All the same,
the latest Escort is modified from, but not a ground-up redesign of, a
car which hardly led the class in terms of handling and ride. It is
still not the sportiest-feeling car in its group of natural rivals.
The engines available -- 1.6 and 1.8 petrol, and 1.8 turbo diesel --
are not top of the class either in power, torque or high-rev smoothness.
But the other changes have managed to make the Escort feel far more
refined than it ever did before.
Another major improvement is to the interior. You can see the Mondeo
influence here, and the whole business of fascia design, seats, door
trim and so on has been totally upgraded. Prices run from #9495 for the
basic 1.6 to #17,370 for the RS2000 4x 4. Best interiors, naturally,
come in the Ghia versions from #12,865 in saloon or hatchback form and
#13,620 as an estate.  A straw poll of colleagues who drove the launch
cars showed that the one gripe about the interior appearance concerned
the wood-lookalike material on the Ghia fascia. The majority opinion was
that this was the Escort's only slip back into the realms of naff.
Not all the planned models in the new range will be available right
away, and several variants will come along later in the year. Without
going into great detail, pending a longer drive on local roads, I can
only repeat that the latest Escort is by a long way the best of the
bunch.

CHARLES Saatchi, co-founder with his brother Maurice of the Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi advertising agency, yesterday quit the presidency of the company
-- it was always a question of when rather than whether -- charging
''constructive dismissal'' and asserting his position had been made
''intolerable''. He intends to sue for damages.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi said last night it had accepted the resignation of
Charles Saatchi and totally rejected any suggestion of unfair or
constructive dismissal.
With Maurice Saatchi, fired as chairman in December, already embroiled
in litigation with the group over his founding of a new agency, the
Saatchi saga looks set to run and run, perhaps for years.
First blood was drawn by Maurice Saatchi earlier this week when
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was refused an injunction in the High Court in London
preventing him from competing with his former agency by soliciting
clients and recruiting former Saatchi staff.
On Wednesday, both the Mirror Group and Gallaher Silk Cut cigarettes
moved their accounts to The New Saatchi Agency, the former with
immediate effect and the latter when its current contract with Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi expires mid year.
Most people connected with the Gallaher advertising had moved to the
new company so Gallaher felt it ought to follow suit. The loss of these
two accounts is not particularly large in terms of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's
income but it does not do its already battered image much good.
Maurice and Charles Saatchi and three executives who left Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi after Maurice was fired -- and who are also suing for
constructive dismissal -- plan to be equal partners in the new venture.
But at present Maurice Saatchi is the only one who is able to work for
the company although the High Court upheld the right of the four others
to join when they are free to do so.
Yesterday, Charles Saatchi maintained that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi made his
position as president intolerable by naming him in legal actions. The
company, though, claims it invited him to meetings to discuss the
situation and he has not turned up. He in turn says he has written to
the company seeking clarification and has had no reply.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has taken legal action against Charles on three
counts -- one claiming a share of the profit he and Maurice made on an
investment in sportswear company Adidas in 1993, over his involvement in
The New Saatchi Agency, and a third over any attempt by the new company
to pass itself off as the old company.
Clearly, on the present course, the solicitors and lawyers are going
to have a field day. The company expects to issue a circular to
shareholders by early next week with its favoured proposal for a new
name for the holding company. Shareholders vote in this on March 16.
Until then it is a case of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi versus Saatchi and
Saatchi.

OVER #6000m of corporation tax receipts boosted public revenues last
month, enabling the Government to repay nearly #3000m of debt.
January is the main month of the year when companies settle their tax
liabilities with the Inland Revenue. With company profits on the mend
receipts were over #1100m higher than in January of last year.
Last month's Public Sector Debt Repayment was #1000m higher than a
year ago. Privatisation proceeds conmtributed #88m from the sale of
Welsh assets of British Coal.
With just two months of the fiscal year left the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement totalled #20.1bn, #9500m less than at the same
period of last year.
In the March Budget the Treasury forecast a PSBR of #34.3bn for
1994/95 against #45.4bn last year. There are still hopes in the City
that the Government will undershoot its target by about #2000m, but the
mad March spend by government departments makes this difficult to
predict. Last year the PSBR totalled #15.8bn in the last two months of
the year.
So far this year both Government revenues and spending have been
undershooting Treasury forecasts, mainly because inflation has been less
than expected.
Cash receipts for the first 10 months were 9% higher at #191.4bn than
in the same period in 1993/4. Inland Revenue receipts were 13.5% higher;
Customs and Excise 9.5% higher; and Social Security 11% higher.
By contrast net departmental outlays, excluding on-lending to local
authorities and public corporations, were 2% higher at #203.1bn.
Privatisation proceeds totalled #4600m against #3500m in the first 10
months of last year. Local authorities have repaid #1500m in the first
10 months, much less than the #4100m at the same stage of last year.
Public corporations have made a net repayment of #2500m so far compared
with #1100m by January of last year.
The strong contribution from corporation tax last month revived City
chat about tax cuts in the November Budget. The Treasury has forecast a
PSBR of #21.5bn next year, falling to #13bn in 1996/7, the year when tax
cuts would be likely to take effect.
By then the PSBR would be just 1.75% of gross domestic product, well
below the EU's central target of 3%. Hence the scope for tax cuts.
But the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, has to be sure
that he does not fuel an untimely boom with tax cuts as Lord Lawson did
in the late eighties.
Fiscal relaxation might have to be accompanied by higher interest
rates than would otherwise be necessary.
Minutes of the meeting between the Treasury and the Bank of England on
December 28, the one before it was decided to increase interest rates
for the third time since September, were largely ignored in the City.
The Governor of the Bank, Eddie George, was pleased with the reception
financial markets accorded the December 7 rate hike. The Chancellor
agreed, but pointed out that it had not been so well received by
sections of the business community, suggesting that it was likely to
have a restraining effect on activity.
Mr George was concerned about persistent cost and price pressures at
the early stages of the production and distribution chain. He also
pointed to evidence of pay settlements edging upwards.
Mr Clarke said that there few indications of inflation pressures at
the retail level.

CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke yesterday put the final
touch to the electricity share sale as he fixed the discount to the
institutional price for private investors at 10p per share, the same as
in the BT3 issue of 1993.
So investors who have registered interest with a ''share shop'' will
be paying first instalments of 170p per National Power share and 185p
per PowerGen, 10p less than the institutions.
Mini-prospectuses will start to be mailed to registrants from early
next week, condensed from the 140-page densely printed full prospectus.
But even the mini version remains a tough read and most people will turn
directly to the public application form at the back which follows the
usual pattern.
But investors who do plough through it will find a number of warnings
related to the principle uncertainties facing the companies, which
consist of increasing competition, a possible reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission for failing to meet conditions imposed
by the industry regulator, Offer, and tighter pollution controls.
National Power and PowerGen have been exposed to a significant
increase in competition since 1990 from new combined cycle gas turbine
power stations and rising output from Nuclear Electric. The new power
stations run on natural gas and are cheaper to run. They are also much
less polluting than coal plants which provide most of the generators'
output.
The companies have already surrendered market share, particularly
National Power, which is down from 45% in 1991 to 35%. The decline is
likely to continue for a while yet and further competition will come
from the upgraded interconnector from Scotland once this is up and
running.
As for a monopolies reference, the companies can give no assurance
that this would not impact upon them to a significant extent. The
companies are supposed to ensure that prices in the pool or wholesale
market are on average below a figure agreed with the regulator Professor
Stephen Littlechild and to sell off a number of power stations to help
the development of competition. Whether these conditions will be met is
doubtful.
Certainly there has been no sign of any takers for second-hand power
stations. Failure will not automatically result in a reference, though
Mr Littlechild will not want to be seen giving way to pressure from the
generators. A reference could result in the companies being broken up or
more stringent conditions being imposed on them.
Finally there is a warning that future pollution regulation will be
tightened which may result in ''substantial'' further costs or
liabilities, though the industry has already spent around #3000m on
improvements. Not appearing in the prospectus is the possibility of a
tougher environment for the companies should Labour form the next
government, though this should also be borne in mind.
These factors mean that investors should not buy the shares in
anticipation of another threefold rise in the share prices, as has
happened since the first tranche of shares was sold. But they equally do
not mean the latest sale will not be a roaring success.
A total of 3,100,000 people have registered with share shops and most
of these will follow this up by applying for shares. Institutional
interest is reportedly strong and the international marketing of the
issue is not yet complete -- a roadshow is visiting Scotland on Monday.
Keen demand is almost inevitable and the over-allotment procedure will
ensure a steady after-market in the shares. This involves the
Government's advisers, Kleinwort Benson and BZW, over-issuing shares
with the intention of buying them back later in order to support the
price.
The certain prospect of large dividend increases in coming years will
alone be enough to ensure the shares give a reasonable performance,
though this is partly discounted in their current rating. Further in the
future they are likely to settle down into typical utility stocks
offering a higher than average yield, but no excitement.
Most buyers of privatisation stocks give little thought of selling
them but they ought regularly to dust down their share certificates and
see if the shares are still worth holding on to and this will certainly
be the case for the power generators.
Selling as well as buying shares marks out a real investor and though
Mr Clarke proudly declared that privatisation had raised the number of
shareholders to 10 million, few can be said to have become serious
investors, though they must now expect regular mailshots from their
share shops to persuade them to invest more. It is the first sale to use
share shops exclusively for private investors. There was no direct share
information office this time, and Mr Clarke said this would be the
pattern for the future.
So as the Government has finally got privatisation down to a fine art
-- though the regulatory frameworks leave much to be desired -- it has
run out of easy things to sell, particularly as the Post Office, the
Forestry Commission and Scottish water are to remain in the public
sector. Railtrack looms uncertainly on the horizon but it promises to be
the most difficult of the lot.

ALLIED DOMECQ has sold its Lyons cakes business to Tomkins for #35m
cash subject to approval from the Office of Fair trading. That is
involved because the Tomkins subsidiary RHM is the biggest manufacturer
of ambient cakes in Britain with brands such as Mr Kipling and Cadbury's
Cakes.
The Lyons business include Hales Cakes and Gateaux, based in Dublin.
It is estimated that for the year to March 3 1995, Lyons will achieve
pre-interest profits of #3.4m on sales of #95.1m from net assets of
#29.1m. There appears to be substantial efficiencies to be gained from
putting the two businesses together in an industry with over-capacity.
The acquisition is entirely consistent with the declared strategy of
Tomkins chairmnan Greg Hutchings of making infill acquisitions while it
continues to digest RHM which it bought in 1992.
Unfairly ,the City jury is still out on that deal when it does seem
pretty clear that it was a sound move bringing in a substantial low risk
cash generator.
Allied now has to sell its Tetley tea business to remove one of the
last vestiges of its involvenment in food manufacturing -- it is
currently in talks about the sale of its European baking activities.

MERCHANT bank Quayle Munro suffered a 21% decline in pre-exceptional
revenue before taxation in the six months to December.
The Edinburgh-based group, which reported yesterday, blamed the fall
on lower-than-expected corporate finance fee income. Revenue before
taxation fell from #323,000 in the first-half of its last financial year
to #290,000 but the December 1993 interim figure was distorted by a
#45,000 exceptional charge.
Boosted by a lower tax charge, interim earnings per share actually
increased from 5.5p to 5.8p and Quayle will pay an unchanged interim
dividend of 3p. The merchant bank predicted the tax cost would also be
less in the second-half.
With its listed investments, particularly London-based advertising
agency WMGO Group, on the slide, net asset value fell 5% from 234p to
222p during the six months. Waste management group Shanks &amp; McEwan was
another loser for Quayle.
Company chairman David Ross Stewart said the second-half had started
more satisfactorily, with a higher corporate finance workload.
However, he added that it was difficult to predict whether the
increased activity would result in an improvement in profits in the
second six months and Quayle shares yesterday tumbled 7p to 175p.
The volume of work on the corporate finance side was less than
expected. Chief executive Ian Jones said that, because of the nature of
the business, fee income was ''largely unpredictable'', with the
possibility of transactions falling through.
On the positive side, Quayle's unlisted investments, primarily Selkirk
circuit board manufacturer Exacta Holdings, Montrose-based Eskfood and
Chorley housebuilder Morris Homes, all traded well and further gains
were predicted.
Quayle, which was listed in June 1993, has a string of corporate
clients. However, it is probably best known now for its high-profile
work for the Scottish Office.

JOHN LINKLATER'S article on the bombing of Dresden in the Second World
War perpetuates the myth that up to 250,000 lives were lost during the
raids.
In 1955 the Federal Republic of Germany's official statistical
publication, Deutschland heute, gave the total German loss of civilians
during the war as two million, and of these some 20% to 40% (400,000 to
800,000) can be attributable to strategic bombing.
In other words, if 250,000 lost their lives in Dresden then this
accounts for one-half to one-third of all deaths by strategic bombing in
Germany. I think not; we still have cities such as Berlin, Hamburg,
Cologne, Essen, et al to account for.
Also the destruction of Dresden and other strategic bombing raids
could not have been a war crime. For a crime to be committed there has
to be a law to be broken -- there was no international law regarding
aerial warfare in place.
The last attempt at codifying such a law was the 1923 Hague Air Rules
but these were never ratified or adopted by any nation.
Do not confuse morality with legality; what one can perceive as
immoral is not necessarily illegal.

already proved his spurs as a stand-up and TV comedy writer, part of the
creative team behind The Day Today and Alan Partridge. He also seems the
English equivalent of David Mamet or Sam Shepard.
Like Shepard's Tooth of Crime and True West or Mamet's Glengarry
Glenross, this play is a metaphorical rutting area where the sound of
locking horns is distinctively male and generational. But not around
sexual conquest (nary a female in sight) -- rather the mysterious and
intoxicating allure of poker. Both seducer and destroyer, the weekly
poker game is the ritual by which Stephen, a London restaurant owner
(sharply evoked in Bunny Christie's split-deck metal and chrome set),
exerts control over his various wavering workers and wayward son Carl,
like father a gambling addict.
Bluff and macho counter-bluff, dreams and despair, winning and losing,
Marber introduces these with an extraordinary mastery of humour and rich
observation. Apart from Nicholas Day's crisp Stephen (his floppy
cardigan belies the calculation with which he manipulates all those
around him), Nigel Lindsay's hapless Mugsy (wildly hooked on the idea of
opening his own restaurant from former public conveniences in the Mile
End Road), Ray Wynstone's wonderfully lachrymose chef, Sweeney, and a
typical wide boy wine waiter from Phil Daniels are beguiling creations.
All too inevitably, there's a final showdown over a game -- and
disappointingly, a slightly weak ending. But by then, audience and
players are locked into complicity. The air has crackled with tension
and Marber is home and dry.

WHY this remorse of conscience over Dresden (February 13)?
As a boy I witnessed Coventry's night of baptism by fire.
As for the raid on Clydebank, I have in my possession a Luftwaffe map
of it, dated September 10, 1939.
If we had lost to Germany, would The Herald be questioning Germany's

A festival of new music is to be staged in Glasgow in October. David
Belcher describes the shape of music to come.
HAVING last year enhanced the lives of countless Glaswegian
music-lovers with its many live gigs, workshops, and seminars, Sound
City has now moved on to Bristol. But Glasgow's civic leaders last week
officially backed a new event which is intended to continue what Sound
City 94 began. Buried amid the city's recently announced
multimillion-pound annual budget was a grant of #100,000 for a 10-day
festival of new music to be staged in October.
There is much hard work to be done before then, not least in ensuring
that non-civic bodies stump up a sum which matches that figure. And
there's the troublesome task of finding a name for the forthcoming
event, intended to feature bands from all rungs of the career ladder,
and of all musical hues. Local Glasgow bands; Scottish bands; bands of
global stature; ragga-trance bands; Indo-jazz-fusioneering aggregations;
straightahead rock combos.
If it were to be called Sonic City, would Sega sponsor it? Is Music
City too bland? East 17 have successfully made a trademark out of their
post code, so how about Gee One Gigsville? No Mean Beat City? Does
George Unsquare . . . Rock This Town have a bit too much of the blowhard
Glaswegian about it?
At least the event has received positive backing from every informed
local quarter at a series of meetings staged over the past eight months.
Presided over by the event's prime movers, Bob Palmer, of Glasgow's
Department of Performing Arts, and Musicians' Union Scottish organiser
Ian Smith, these meetings have been attended by representatives from
every leading Scottish promoter and city centre live-music venue; by
native media-wallahs; Glasgow-based music-industry lawyers and
accountants; educationists running specialised rockbiz courses at city
colleges; musicians.
Most crucially, given the importance of Radio 1 last year as an
advertising medium for Sound City in Glasgow, all the major Scottish
radio stations -- Radio Scotland, Clyde, Scot FM -- have given the event
the thumbs up, as well as having indicated their willingness to
co-operate in equitably apportioning broadcasts and thus avoiding
conflicts of interest.
''It was easy last year to dangle the carrot of Radio 1 in front of
big bands,'' says Sound City's co-organiser, Willie Knox. ''This year,
Glasgow's year-round promoters -- King Tut's, the Cathouse, the Garage,
Nice'n'Sleazy -- are going to have to work much harder, with support
from the council taking the form of an overall marketing campaign,
producing programmes, flyers, posters.
''With that form of advertising support, it's easier for promoters to
take risks -- and it's a more proper use of council money, too. The
council shouldn't be directly paying big fees for big names and possibly
bearing a big risk.
''In addition, council money should ideally be used to develop new
audiences by subsidising punters rather than subsidising bands, for the
staging of free gigs or the funding of concessionary tickets.
Ultimately, it's more important for a band to have an extra 100 people
at a show instead of an extra #50 on their fee.''
What's in it for Glasgow's civic fathers?
''Throughout last year Sound City staged 200 gigs, featuring 300
unsigned bands. It gave people an appetite for going out, and during the
main April week a lot of people went out to attend more than one show a
night -- yet we still have a curfew which is intended to restrict
movement and prevent people doing that.
''During New York's New Music Seminar, you can see bands from 8pm till
4am. Not in Glasgow. But if the nature and purpose of the curfew could
be reviewed for our October event, it would surely act as a valuable
experiment in determining the true value of the city's night-time
economy.''
And what has been learnt from Sound City's mistakes -- and mistakes
there were, as Whiteout might attest in the wake of their
less-than-well-received East End community tour. Rowdy teenies
vandalised Whiteout's van as the band played; warring gangs battled to
the plangent strains of Starrclub; Whiteout's vocalist was almost
decapitated by an ungrateful yobbo frisbee'ing his free copy of the
group's single out of the crowd, back towards the stage.
''That was an example of something that was very good, that had
honorable intentions -- and it backfired very badly. We felt we were
giving the communities something . . . and the communities felt they
were having something imposed on them. Occasionally, the community
events we staged were at too advanced a level. What worked best in some
places were basic, practical workshops in which people in bands spoke
about being in bands, answering questions like 'Do you make a living
being a band?'
''Some communities had impractical demands, though. I recall the
Possil Loud'N'Proud Revival Tour, various cover bands playing in pubs.
I'm not being disparaging about anybody, but it might have been better
had Sound City funded basic guitar lessons for local 12-year-olds. After
all, they're the future of the local music economy rather than
semi-established bands doing Simple Minds songs.
''Thankfully, all the community officers now see that and are working
more co-operatively with each other and with Sound City's replacement.''
Whatever it's called, let's hope it follows Sound City's example and
funds some of the more ambitious, elaborate, and artistically
challenging events, like NVA's Soundworks at the Arches and Paul Quinn's
Cheap Flights at the GFT. Not all pop is automatically profit-driven. As
civic funding is regularly extended to theatre, art galleries, and
opera, so it should benefit the more adventurous forms of modern music,
too.
* What's in a name? If you'd like to have a go at naming October's
events, you'll get a Sound City T-shirt. If your chosen name is adopted,
you'll be rewarded with a two-person VIP pass to every event . . . and
if you can stump up five-figure wads of sponsorship cash, you can dance
on the roof of the City Chambers with Bob Palmer, Ian Smith, and me in
City of Glasgow tartan kilts and reversed baseball caps. Entries pronto
to: David Belcher's Name-That-Festival, The Herald, 195 Albion Street,
Glasgow, G1 1QP.

AFTER the success of Craobh Nan Ubhal -- The Apple Tree -- Drama NA
h-Alba, the embryonic Gaelic Theatre Company, might have been expected
to produce another culture-skipping piece.
The Apple Tree -- all scaffolding, lights, noise, and mime -- was
raw-edged expression. It set Gaelic in the modern off-world of North Sea
Oil, language limitations of a wider audience overcome by action and
emotion. Reiteach -- beginning its Scottish tour -- is the complete
opposite. Here the set is bare, the acting subsumed by the words, the
imagery of the language supreme.
To begin the story is a simple boy (bachelor) meets girl (Canadian,
second generation Scot). Just beneath this love tale John Murray has
written an introspection on cultural identity, the Gaelic psyche, that
familiar albatross of bilingual Scots. It is a recurring theme -- sinn
fhein, ourselves -- this time the mirror being held by a woman searching
for a Celtic past. Conflict arises from characters embracing and
rejecting cultural values in increasingly tight spirals.
Away from the complicated text Tony Kearney finds his acting feet in
Reiteach, relishing the maverick character who drives the action to
music. Donna MacLeod and Domhnall Ruadh are confident as the loving
couple backed by singer, actress, and New Yorker Talitha MacKenzie.
This is a demanding play for audience and performers requiring
attention to the subtlety of language as much as the acting. The
script's importance is emphasised by the fact that copies are for sale
in the foyer.
The strong tradition of Gaelic drama is developed with Dan Murray and
Murdo MacLeod joining the professional troup. Nan MacLeod shadowed Irish
director Garvan Macgrath through rehearsals. With Reiteach Gaelic
theatre, like the Gaelic world, is in transition.

I THINK that the Yggdrasil String Quartet, originally of Stockholm,
now adopted by the City of Aberdeen, have the potential to become one of
the great quartets of the day. Launching their inaugural series of
concerts last night -- their official concert debut following their
appointment to Aberdeen in a unique triple partnership between the city,
the university, and the arts council -- they disclosed a catalogue of
credentials.
If those credentials were tarnished at all, then it was probably the
pressure of the occasion -- all the big wheels of the Scottish musical
scene were present.
In two of their pieces -- the Fifth Quartet by Stenhammar and the
first of Beethoven's Rasumovsky quartets -- they took time to settle.
No problems with ensemble: they are phenomenally together. Just an
edginess (and Beethoven's a killer if you're on edge).
By and large, however, this was an outstanding debut. These young lads
are a born string quartet. Their virtuoso playing (and virtuoso dynamic
control) in the Stenhammar was breathtaking.
They found character and wit in the piece. And when the going got
tough they played with massive attack and ferocious bite.
And intelligence, too, as they demonstrated in a performance of Judith
Weir's String Quartet that was marked by clarity and intensity. It was
also, remarked the composer, who was present, the most authoritative
performance that has been given.
More from the Swedish gods soon.

COURTNEY PINE has never been exactly what you might call shy on stage.
Now he's in danger of turning a jazz gig into a good night out. The
showman in him was on display early. He loves eye contact with his
audience and as he skated through a far from slushy Misty the bug eyes
were on us. A ''how does he do that?'' bout of circular breathing had
him on his knees.
This was nothing. Not even the audience countdown to a teasingly brief
version of Eddie Harris's funky Listen Here that finished the first half
(a full version opened the second) gave a hint of how far he was going
to take the fun, so for those of you who weren't there I'll fast forward
and tell you how far.
Sidewinder had him careering around the audience, soloing (and making
perfect sense), quoting Stevie Wonder's Isn't She Lovely at a blonde in
row E. If this isn't your idea of fun, you're probably one of the only
two people who failed to stand up and clap your hands as instructed
before the encore could begin.
Not that it was all showbiz. Pine's past concerts have often featured
a whole lot of empty virtuosity. This one had plenty solid jazz and
rather than simply playing to the gallery, Pine's ''sheets of sound''
outing on Misty impressively interwove about six different themes. It
was occasionally slick, sometimes challenging, and the DJs' scratching
and hip hop loops, once they could be heard, fitted well alongside a
hard-working band.
So if you're going to Pine's gigs in Edinburgh (tonight) or Aberdeen
(tomorrow), leave your jazz baggage behind and don't forget your dancing
shoes.

MAYBE it was last week, maybe it was last year, or as far back as
1988, or it might be tomorrow. You suddenly look up and -- like Forced
Entertainment -- you see the bleakness, the messiness, the stupid silly
wastage of our times. Hidden J -- repeated at the CCA tonight and
tomorrow -- is the company's evocation of that landscape which is at
once familiar and yet increasingly inhospitable.
Subtitled Bad News Bad People Bad Debts, the piece jigsaws together
glimpses of little lives that are relentlessly askew. Party animals
losing themselves in a noisy welter of boos and pranks -- fun for all,
but not so funny for the guy who ends up the outsider, naked and
disoriented. Then there's the worst ever Best Man, fumbling and rambling
through the usual cliched phrases -- his incompetence is hilarious, but
as he battles on through one unfinished banality after another the
balance tilts quite brilliantly. The laughter drains away from his
situation, he becomes a sad, drab emblem of something futile and
hopeless.
Everything about the piece has been carefully crafted to suggest
fragmentation, dislocation, harshness, and yet there is a brilliantly
comic edge to so much of the clever incongruity. All the strengths of
this company -- the ability to combine layers of meaning in one image --
means that one can chortle at some poor soul's litany of failure and
inadequacy even as one begins to hear in it sorry echoes of a
Thatcherite regime which has preached a hollow set of values that have
left too many feeling inadequate. Forced Entertainment is at present
facing its own bad times -- arts council funding is being withheld
because, apparently, it turns in poor work. Would that I could see such
poor work more often. For a resume of how much it has achieved, turn up
tomorrow at 2pm for a special talk/lecture that celebrates a decade of
radical experiment.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke told the Telegraph yesterday: ''I found the
latest figures perfectly balanced and consistent with the healthy
recovery that I think we are delivering.'' His words are subtly
revealing.
Mr Clarke and his colleagues are publicly committed to the primrose
path of economic virtue -- an export-led recovery sustained by stable
prices at home. No tinsel, he promises. No artificial booms. If we can
do that for two more years, the Chancellor argues, all this stuff about
the missing feel-good factor will be seen to have been ''a bit of a
cliche''. By then, presumably, we will all feel good because we will all
be feeling profoundly virtuous.
The Chancellor was speaking as headline inflation edged higher for the
fourth successive month; as dreary retail sales figures for January
punctured some of the post-Christmas sales hype indulged in by leading
retailers; and as the downward trend in the official count of the
unemployed showed signs of tailing off.
Mr Clarke was also talking in the wake of three successive rises in
interest rates, in which he had a hand; a rocky pound; and mounting
evidence that last year's 4% growth is already being squeezed quite
hard.
Whether that amounts to perfect balance is, at best, debatable. But
the most revealing thing about Mr Clarke's comment to the Telegraph is
the tacit admission that neither he, nor anyone else for that matter,
really knows whether the figures add up to a healthy recovery or not.
Look at those words again. The Chancellor thinks he is delivering a
healthy recovery. And he thinks the latest indicators are still
consistent with the fact of that recovery. The trouble is that in the
Treasury, the Bank of England, the City, and everywhere else where
players claim to make sense of what is happening, complex economic
reality, as it is lived and experienced by each and everyone of us, is
reduced to a small set of key monthly indicators.
Changes in these official numbers, and the interpretation placed on
these changes by markets, are the main triggers for action. Each time Mr
Clarke and the Governor of the Bank of England have raised interest
rates in the past five months, that's what they've been responding to. A
signal of inflationary pressures here. A sign of unsustainable growth
there.
The unspeakable question is: how accurate a reflection of economic
reality are these figures? And, if the answer is the equivalent of
putting the height of Ben Nevis somewhere between 2000 and 6000 feet,
does reacting to such slippery evidence with decisive action make things
worse as often as it makes things better?
Of course governments and central bankers try to temper the diet of
official statistics with more empirical evidence of what's going on. The
Bank of England, for example, maintains a network of agents around the
country -- one of them in Scotland -- who carry out a steady programme
of company visits and report back on the mood as they find it.
Achieving that blend of apparently objective evidence and feel for
what is actually happening on the ground is a critical challenge for
modern policy makers, whatever their political hue. You might have
noticed that every time the BBC's Economics Editor Peter Jay wants to
take a poke a current government policy, he takes himself off to the
real world to ram home his point. On Wednesday evening he was reflecting
on the latest inflation and retail sales figures from a shopping centre
in Winchester.
The trouble is that, trapped in the Whitehall birdcage of official
advice, ministerial cars, and the Commons tearoom the hard numbers tend
to win every time over subjective experience. Ministers, central
bankers, and those dawn-to-dusk City analysts simply don't get much time
to go out and soak in what the rest of the world is saying or thinking.
You detect that more and more in the increasingly desperate ''Why are
they not more grateful?'' pleas of ministers, convinced they have
delivered the sweetest confluence of economic circumstances in a
generation. I wonder at their puzzlement.
Take the export-led recovery. Unless you are an exporter, supply an
exporter, own shares in an exporter, or work for an exporter, why would
the export boom that followed sterling's exit from the exchange rate
mechanism make you feel good?
And even if you work for an exporter, booming business may not be
sufficient reason for you to send Ken Clarke a case of his favourite
ale. Ask 600 families at Rolls-Royce in East Kilbride what the group's
latest Indian order means to them.
At the moment, Scotland's computer industry may be shipping boxes as
fast as it can assemble them. But if I worked at IBM in Greenock, say,
my sense of security would be affected as much by the defection, in
quick succession, of the head of IBM Europe, the head of worldwide PC
manufacturing, and the head of IBM UK, as by a bulging, albeit tight
margin, order book. Do they know something I don't?, I would be asking
myself.
It's a similar story in Scotland's other great exporting industry,
whisky, where failure to crack inequitable duties, even at a UK or
European Union level, continues to cast a cloud over the sector's
prospects.
For those untouched by exports or exporting, there are still, it seems
to me, as many reasons for feeling bad as there are for feeling good.
Mortgage rates are edging up again. Council rents and council taxes will
rise substantially in April. Work is becoming increasingly casualised.
The education system is being asked to soak up more and more of the
surplus. Rewards, for most people, are at a virtual standstill in real
terms. We are becoming a more fractious, divided, and cynical society.
Surveying his numbers, resolute in his determination to choke off
inflation, Ken Clarke apparently thinks another two years of the same
will prove all this to have been a cliche. We shall see.

AS one of his onerous duties as a high hedi yin at Guinness, Lord
Macfarlane of Bearsden travelled to Manila in the Philippines to preside
at the Johnnie Walker Classic golf tournament. It must have been the jet
lag when he began a speech: ''I'd like to thank the Philistines, er
Filipinos, for their warm welcome . . .''
Keep it to yourself
SCOTLAND'S Champion was reeling against the ropes yesterday. Forgive
the tabloidese but we are talking about the Daily Record, self-styled
''Scotland's Champion'' which was the subject of complaints yesterday
from furious readers.
The Record chose the headline ''Our Shame'' for its front-page story
about the English soccer hooligans' antics in Dublin. This from a
newspaper with a proud tradition of lambasting other media for confusing
British with English guilt.
Such were the reverberations of the gaffe that the Record's English
bosses at Mirror Group Newspapers in London were demanding explanations
from editor Terry Quinn. And Mr Quinn isn't even English.
A friend indeed
A TOUCHING announcement in the acknowledgements section of the Lennox
Herald newspaper. Among the list of thanks for help following their
bereavement is one to a family friend ''for his uplifting spirit and
cheerfulness, on his many visits his parting words 'Mind your heid on
the lobby lamp' always left us laughing''.
Side effects
THERE's nothing like a hip replacement to get the conversation going,
as our old friend Bill Waddell from Cumbernauld has recently found out.
He is recovering from one such operation, and last week he bumped (but
not literally, we hope) into a wee wumman who set about reassuring him
at great length about the efficacy of a ''hip transplant''. Like
everyone else, she knew someone who had had one and was now enjoying a
new lease of life. And she added: ''It amazes me that these donors can
go on living a normal life wi' just the one hip''.
Home from home
THE director-general of the Swedish Prison Service, Major General
Bertel Osterdahl, revealed that, like his Scottish counterparts, he does
not have his troubles to seek.
The Swedish system has had an influx of Latvian, Lithuanian, and
Estonian criminals. But it's not exactly Mafia stuff. The visitors from
the Baltic states pop across the border with the specific intention of
committing an offence.
Nothing major, just enough to guarantee a short custodial sentence.
They are happy enough, since the conditions in Swedish jails are far
better than conditions outside on the other side of the Baltic. Also,
they can make more in prison wages in Sweden than in most jobs at home.
Lost cause
I POPPED down to Pollok Free State, site of the Glasgow M77 tree wars,
in the role of impartial observer. Then I discovered that they are
building the motorway through my childhood.
When I was a boy in the mid-1950s, the countryside started at my front
door. Across the Brock Burn were some football pitches and then open
ground stretching away up to a magical place we called the Gala Park.
Summer days were spent in the Gala Park. From morning till night.
There was no need to go home for lunch. There was always a campfire with
hot bubbling soup, courtesy of Galloway's the butchers who left their
packets of Knorr on a window ledge which was vulnerable to young
shoplifting fingers. Galbraith's the grocers were also very generous,
albeit unwittingly.
It was a busy life paddling in the burn, watching the soldiers from
the nearby Army camp on manoeuvres with their girlfriends, and being
chased by local farmers and greenkeepers at the Pollok and Cowglen golf
clubs.
It was the beginning of the end in 1957 when they tore up half of the
football pitches to build Bellarmine school. We did our best at sabotage
by putting sand in the fuel tanks of the bulldozer.
But they built the school and took their revenge by incarcerating us
in it. The suburban blight spread rapidly. They built another school
called Craigbank for the Protestants. It is now lying empty as, they
say, Bellarmine will also soon be.
The Army camp was replaced by the National Savings Bank which at least
gave jobs for those who survived Bellarmine and Craigbank. Commerce
arrived in the shape of the Pollok Centre, a dreary monument to the
consumer society which succeeds only in pointing up the poverty of the
area.
I looked in to see the people who populate the campsite they call
Pollok Free State and who still believe they can stop the motorway.
The Pollok Free State campsite is a wee boy's dream. In the very woods
where the polis and the golf course greenkeepers used to chase us for
playing cowboys and indians, there are now totem poles, tepees, tree
houses -- all sorts of esoteric artefacts erected by adults and fully
sanctioned by police and planning department alike.
They have a field kitchen which specialises in great pots of soup made
from mounds of fresh veg. None of your shoplifted Knorr packets.
When I visited, the conversation over cups of tea round the huge
campfire was to a background of fiddle music.
It's the sort of place where you can sit up all night round the fire,
you get to flout authority, your mum doesn't come looking for you to
thrust you into the bath. Even better than the Gala Park days.
And you get to meet interesting people. An American Indian chief,
faith healers from Brighton, New Age protesters from all over the world.
And Alsatian dogs. It wouldn't be Pollok without the Alsatian dogs.
I walked from Pollok Free State over to what is left of the Gala Park.
It is now a blasted heath, a bleak wasteland which can be improved only
by putting a motorway through it.
What I am saying is that the battle to save my particular dear green
place was lost long ago. They are fighting a losing battle, too, in
Pollok Free State.

BY the use of selective statistics and a careful employment of
language, Michael Fry tries to persuade us that the Thatcherite
experiment was a success (February 11).
In 1979 the UK had a national income per head on a par with that of
France and ahead of Italy. We now struggle to keep ahead of Spain.
The crumbs from a rich man's table theory of income distribution works
(if at all) only if there is substantial, real growth. Contrary to
Michael Fry's assertion, the average annual real growth rate in Mrs
Thatcher's time, at 1.9%, was markedly and disastrously less than during
the oft-maligned premierships of Messrs Wilson and Heath (2.8%).
The reality of Mrs Thatcher's squalid rule included record
unemployment, record bankruptcies, and a catastrophic shrinking of the

R A P CALDWELL states that Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda was in general
practice in Renfrew at the same time as my late husband (January 14).
Dr Banda did work with Dr John Todd for a time. In 1941 Dr Banda was
in Liverpool before being directed to Tyneside. He had, as a pacifist,
refused to join the Army.
Gordon Currie graduated in 1944. He was assistant to Dr John Todd for
nine months from the summer of 1945, after which he went to Nyasaland
(Malawi).
The first time he met Dr Banda was at an afternoon tea party at the
start of the Malawi Congress Party's election campaign. This event took
place at Fort Manning. The local MCP candidate introduced us to Dr
Banda. Dr Currie then said, ''I was assistant to Dr Todd in Renfrew'',
whereupon Dr Banda exclaimed with a Scottish accent, ''It's a small
world!'' and warmly shook his hand again.
After the election, Mr M W Kanyama Chiume became Minister of Education
and planned to visit every school in the country. He informed Dr Currie
that he also would address the patients when he came to the leprosarium
school.
On arrival Mr Chiume headed straight for the Protestant church, which
housed the school, omitting the normal formality of seeing the doctor
first. So the doctor had to run after the Minister. This incident may be
the basis of R A P Caldwell's claim that Dr Banda ignored Dr Currie.
Later correspondence between Dr Currie and Dr Banda was entirely
amicable.

JEUX sans Frontieres, jeux avec frontieres. The laager-louts of
British politics -- and they come from both right and left -- are
playing mirthless power games with the nation's status as island
fortress; which has been something of an illusion anyway since the
invention of the smart bomb and the electronic money market.
When the Channel Tunnel opened they worried about rabid rats sneaking
into the country. Now, as M. Santer presses the case for opening the
borders of the European Union, they worry about rabid foreigners.
Borders, frontiers -- they are powerful totems on the landscape of the
human story. They have earned a menacing place in literature and drama:
the long Le Carre walk through the checkpoints of the Berlin Wall, the
furtive figures beneath the watchtowers, the bureaucrats on the Stamboul
Train, the desperate swimmers in the Rio Grande.
In fiction and in fact the border is the emblem of an exquisitely
tormenting ambiguity. It is danger and safety, homecoming and exile,
capture and escape, acceptance and rejection.
Even in the stale ennui of our airport queues we can't quite evade
these resonances. Which of us hasn't felt shifty as we look the
gatekeeper in the eye? At the extreme edge of border nervousness is the
nightmare of the refugee. And it's a mad irony of British resistance to
the freeing of EU frontiers that the nation who most protests is the
nation with the least experience of the trauma of the fugitive. It's
nearly 300 years since the last Englishman fled to safety across the
Scottish Border, and vice versa.
North of the Border, South of the Border. We have lived more or less
comfortably with Britain's internal frontier for three centuries. Its
line is something of an abstraction. Certain laws and institutions
readjust themselves when we cross it. The domestic architecture, the old
designs of towns and villages and the configuration of the countryside
slowly change, but these shifts are scarcely fundamental.
Instead, we turn the ghostly boundary into something which either
satisfies or disappoints our romantic expectations of the frontier
crossing.
At its western end it's a river; no mighty Zambezi or trans-European
waterway like the Danube, but the meagre River Sark, where the interface
between Scotland and England subsides into sullen flatlands, as if
exhausted by old wars. The M74 treats the Sark with contempt. At the
eastern end it is almost-a-river, but the A1 fords the Tweed some few
miles south of the invisible line. For frontier drama we must choose the
high pass of Carter Bar, where the A68 vaults over the Cheviots on a
crest which marks the Border.
The natural obstacles of rivers and ranges have defined many a
nation's edges. ''Climb every mountain,'' sang the mother superior in
The Sound of Music. So the Family Von Trapp packed their rucksacks and
walked over the Tirolean alps into Switzerland, the model bolthole.
Europe has devised double standards for Switzerland, its oldest
multicultural, plurilingual democracy. The country which invented the
cuckoo clock but didn't have the Renaissance (remember Harry Lime's
brutal aphorism?) is both despised and cherished for its long
neutrality.
I've been looking through my passports for the Swiss stamps which
might chronicle several visits to that country, but I can't find any.
And Switzerland isn't even a member of the EU. In fact, the last French
stamp I can find is dated 1981 and the last Spanish one 1978, and I've
been back to France and Spain many times since.
I'm now on my third 10-year passport (its stately British blue will
soon be replaced with EU burgundy) and the only stamps and visas in the
current document are either non-European, or those which pre-date the
dismantling of the Eastern Bloc states.
Anyone who has travelled on the Continent in the past 10 years,
whether in or out of the EU's member states, knows that border controls
have become more and more cursory. Mainland Europeans have long treated
their frontiers more casually than we do. You can board a train in Paris
and get off in Budapest and the border crossings of four countries are
little more distracting than the interruption of a ScotRail ticket-check
between Waverley and Queen Street.
Even at the extremity of Europe, in Istanbul, you can stand in the
Sirkeci station and see transcontinental trains whose destinations read
like chapter headings in twentieth-century European history: Bruxelles,
Munchen, Wien, Zagreb, Beograd, Sofia; as if, for all the hideous crimes
its people have visited on each other, a shared purpose and common
destiny are forged in the steel of Europe's railway network.
If such moments make me sentimental about Europe they don't make me
soft-headed. I'm aware that it's only the traveller of Caucasian aspect
who moves more and more smoothly across its borders. When Fort Britain
lets down the drawbridge to its EU partners, as eventually it must, it
will raise it again on the external frontier of Fort Europe; and on the
other side of the great Mediterranean moat the huddled masses will wait
and dream.
Well, huff the legislators, the bureaucrats, the man and woman in the
street, we must draw the line somewhere. I suppose we must until we find
a working alternative to the nation state and its partisan
conglomerates, but the more I travel the harder it becomes to find the
definitive borderlines of my cultural identity. When I'm in England I
feel Scottish; when I'm in North America I feel European; when I'm in
Asia I feel Western; when I'm in Africa, most troublingly, I feel white.
And when I'm in Europe? There was a time when that was when I felt
most British. These days, whether in or out of the EU, I feel one of the
crowd. ''The idea of national characteristics,'' remarked Stephen
Leacock, long before the idea of European unity, ''has been greatly
overdone.'' There may be some nostalgia when I hand in my last piece of
grave blue cardboard with its totemic crest and old presumptions, but
there will be no regrets.
It will join its partners, with their clipped corners, at the back of
my desk. Every so often I will pull it out and browse through the stamps
and visas of the world outside Fort Europe; with the relaxed mindset and
pleasant recall of the traveller who has always been permitted ''to pass
freely, without let or hindrance'', knowing nothing of the nightmare of
the refugee.

''I coulda been a contender.'' Well I was. Many times. One of the
contentions was for the post of vice-president of the Educational
Institute of Scotland. There were a lot of contentions at that,
especially within the teaching profession, of which I was a somewhat
maverick member, for many on left and right thought I was a wee
foul-mouthed bastard who would cause nothing but trouble. Last week saw
the election of a new general secretary of the major Scottish teaching
union, and saw a somewhat anodyne, though time will tell, candidate win.
All of the candidates for what was not so long ago a horribly
important political position in Scottish life -- after all long-time
general secretary John Pollock had been chairman of the Labour Party in
Scotland twice -- were of course anodyne.
There are three strands to Scottish identity which count: the only
ones that really do. The religious system whereby we are utterly
independent of the State, the unique Scottish legal system, close to
Europe and highly respected world-wide -- and Scottish education. For
many years this has been anglified and transmogrified. For many years
the Scots have felt this should not be so. And it has taken many a
fighter in and out of the world of education to stem the tide.
One of the doughtiest of all has just written a book about his long
and pugnacious life. He is Kenny McLachlan, an ex-president of the EIS
himself, the president in fact of the hardest ever years, the strike of
1983-85, the longest teachers' strike ever, and the only industrial
dispute which Thatcher lost following her victory over the miners. It is
Kenny McLachlan with whom I was the running mate all those years ago.
As it happens both Kenny and myself were ex-Communist Party members. I
have never felt the pain that Kenny clearly did when he was expelled
from The Party. He was expelled simply for being his own man, though a
trumped-up charge was used against him, mainly by West-End Comms who
hadn't seen a single-end in their lives. (I was expelled for ''bourgeois
adventurism '', that is, being pissed at parties and trying to seduce
lassies.)
BUT Kenny, who had not only fought for communism, but also for the
Western democracies during the war -- I may say he made an
extraordinarily handsome squaddie if the war-time photie in his book is
anything to go by -- but he never stopped fighting at all.
I can assure you that Kenny never went for the high positions which he
often reached, for reasons of egotism. I have seldom met anybody with
less pretensions and, believe me, I know all about egotism. Kenny worked
himself into the ground for what he believed. And his faith, sometimes
rather as woolly as his fluffy ring of hair I am afraid, never wavers.
Throughout his book, to be launched tomorrow at midday in,
characteristically, Maryhill Burgh Halls, (Kenny lives in Maryhill), he
never flinches from his belief in the essential goodness of every man,
woman or child, and of the inherent evils of all organisations,
bureaucratic or otherwise. Except of course for the Communist Party.
Nothing can be more sad than listening to ex-party members telling of
such a disillusionment. Even lapsed Catholics cannot express such
despair as that of the ex-faithful of Moscow. And this book is fired
through with that sense of betrayal by what was to be the Great Vision.
It is difficult to explain what The Party meant to those who belonged,
of how the links in the golden chain forged a comradeship which never
quite leaves you, even to sceptics like myself. Kenny comes from a
different age, of course, but even then I suspect he always would have
done.
He is not cynical at all. Despite a hard life, and he blithely
describes some awful things in his book, and many tragedies such as the
early death, from a rare form of cancer, of his son Kenneth, despite all
that, Kenny McLachlan is ever the optimist. Sometimes I don't know how
or why people like Kenny can still think so well of the world: I wish I
did though.
And yet despite all the commitment and the seriousness and the
hardness of his life and all the tragedies I can tell you this: as Para
Handy said of Hurricane Jeck: ''He has the hert of an innocent child.''
I never met a man held in mair affection. I coulda been a contender.
Kenny was. He won many of his battles. Let's hope he wins in the end,
the decent man.

NANNY problems are not something many of us face. Nevertheless it is a
problem for some -- as the recent successful BBC series, Tears Before
Bedtime, revealed. Did you know, for instance, there are more than
100,000 nannies working at any one time in the UK? A recent survey in
Nursery World found that on average a nanny cares for two children under
three years old. Yet, despite the high number of young children cared
for in this way, nannies are the only form of full-time day care for
under eights not required to be registered and, since this January,
nanny agencies are no longer required to be licensed to operate by the
Department of Employment.
Earlier this month saw the launch of Nanny Umbrella, the first attempt
to set standards of care for children looked after in their own home as
well as standards in employment conditions for nannies. The Nanny
Umbrella (whose supporters include training bodies and employment
agencies) wants nannies to be registered under the Children Act like all
other forms of full-time child care.
Nanny Umbrella aims to conduct a feasibility study into this.
Meanwhile it has produced two free leaflets, So You Want To Be A Nanny?
and So You Want To Employ A Nanny? Copies available free (please enclose
sae) from Parents at Work, 77 Holloway Road, London N7 8JZ.
Join the B&amp;B brigade
YOU live in an attractive part of Scotland, better still along one of
the main tourist routes, and you've got a spare bedroom. Maybe you've
toyed with the idea of doing a bit of B&amp;B but hesitated. What are the
snags? Can you turn people away because you don't like the look of them?
These and many more questions will be answered in a two-day training
seminar, Setting Up a Bed and Breakfast Business, on March 6 and 7 in
Callander.
Organised by the Loch Lomond, Stirling and Trossachs Tourist Board, it
costs #20 but could turn out to be a very worthwhile investment. For
those who already run a B&amp;B and want to polish up their skills and
increase their profits there is another two-day seminar, also #20, in
Bridge of Allan (March 20 and 21). Ring Loch Lomond, Stirling and
Trossachs Tourist Board (0786) 470945 for details.
Time-served helpers
WANTED: older people, at least 50-plus, for community work. Well, you
don't often see adverts like that these days do you? So what's the
catch? Yes, you've guessed: it's voluntary work. But that's not to
denigrate it. In fact older people have many skills to offer, and often
an interesting job, along with an opportunity to contribute still to the
community, is more important than financial reward.
Now the RSVP, Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme, is anxious to
recruit community service volunteers in both Strathclyde and Edinburgh.
Organiser Jack Waddell says the projects vary but provide mainly care
and support for disadvantaged people in these areas. ''The demand for
our services is increasing all the time,'' says Mr Waddell. ''We
urgently need more volunteers.''
If you would like to help, contact Jack Waddell, 37 Berwick Drive,
Cardonald, Glasgow (041) 882 7097.
On the badger trail
YOU could spend this Sunday morning lounging in bed with the papers.
Or you could dress up in your winter woollies, walking boots, and join
several dozen others for a brisk walk looking for badger trails, weasels
or winter birds.
Drumpellier Country Park is organising a walk at 10am on Sunday from
the visitor centre. Further information from the Ranger Service,
Townhead Road, Coatbridge (01236) 422257.

One thing is guaranteed to make parents hopping mad -- the cost of
children's shoes. So much so we are buying fewer pairs, and making do
and mending more. Deedee Cuddihy looks at the reasons.
IF YOU want to see a group of parents spring to life, mention
children's shoes. The subject can excite even more comment and
controversy than computer games or junk food.
Most of us have an opinion on them -- and it's often a bad one. ''Too
expensive'', ''trainers are just a con'', and ''they were done within a
fortnight'' are the kinds of expressions you'll hear when children's
footwear is brought up for discussion.
Most of the dissatisfaction stems from the fact that although you can
pay adult prices -- and more -- for kids' shoes, a pair may be outgrown
within a matter of weeks despite assurances from some specialists that,
properly fitted, they should be roomy enough to last at least three
months.
''Well, yes,'' admitted Clive Chance, shoeshop owner and British
chairman of the Children's Foot Health Register. ''You can get a sudden
growth spurt shortly after shoes have been bought and, frankly, there's
nothing that can be done about it.''
In other words, there's no way the retailers -- having previously
boasted that they are experts in their field and that all staff, even
the 16-year-olds, are fully trained and, therefore, know a lot more
about your child's feet than you do -- are going to admit liability.
You'll just have to pass these nearly-new shoes on to a lucky friend and
stump up for another pair.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council's consumer and trading
standards department revealed that shoes, both children's and adults,
were among their top 10 most complained-about items. Disgruntled
shoppers willingly left more than 600 pairs of unsatisfactory shoes with
the department last year to be tested by independent experts.
But retailers like Clive Chance maintain that if consumers stuck to
proper shoe shops such as Clarks and Start-Rite where children's
footwear is fitted by an assistant, rather than relying on the
do-it-yourself method at, for instance, Marks &amp; Spencer and BhS, we
would have less to complain about.
It's an argument that is not borne out by a recent report from the
Consumers' Association which found that there was little difference in
fit between cheaper children's shoes bought off the shelf and more
expensive ones sold by trained staff.
During the investigation, families were sent out to buy shoes from
Clarks or Start-Rite as well as stores like M &amp; S. The children and the
shoes were then examined by a leading foot surgeon and an expert shoe
fitter. They discovered that of nine pairs of Start-Rite shoes, four
were a bad fit, five could have been better, and none was good. Out of
16 pairs of Clarks, two were badly fitted, nine were good, and five
could have been better. Of 16 pairs bought off the shelf, four fitted
badly, seven were good, and five could have been better.
The report concluded that although you will get advice and help from
shops selling Clarks or Start-Rite shoes, you won't necessarily end up
with a better fit.
In addition, the report gave the thumbs-up (or should that be the
toes-up?) to trainers, provided they are leather, because they cushion
the feet and have light, flexible soles.
All of which was bad news for Clarks, which although it came out
slightly ahead of the off-the-shelf product and way ahead of the company
which carries a royal warrant, subsequently announced the closure of one
of its children's footwear factories with the loss of 360 jobs. A
spokesman blamed the closure on a decline in demand in the UK for
children's shoes -- sales have fallen from 69.07 million in 1988 to
55.83 million in 1993.
I talked to another Clarks spokesperson at the company's headquarters
in Somerset who maintained that while overall sales of children's shoes
in the UK were down, the company's own share of the market had remained
the same.
The Clarks empire comprises, as well as factories, 700 shops including
Ravel, Kay Shoes, and Bayne &amp; Duckett. Eighty per cent of the footwear
it sells is still made in the UK, although the company, which celebrates
its 170th birthday this year, admitted it was finding it increasingly
difficult to resist the pressure to have more shoes made abroad, where
overheads were smaller.
''Families have less money to spend now,'' said their spokesman. ''And
they're buying fewer pairs of shoes. Where once a child would have a
pair of school shoes and another pair for parties, many parents are
making do with only one general purpose style which they're more
inclined to repair than in the recent past.''
Even Molly Weir, for whom, famously, ''Shoes Were For Sunday'', had
boots during the week, patent leather lace-ups for best, and a new pair
of gutties at the end of June.
Although it's said that fewer pairs of children's shoes are being
bought in the UK, more companies are fighting for a share of the market.
Hush Puppies has recently introduced a junior range which costs about
the same as Clarks but seems to have the edge in style and colour.
Clarks maintains that its fitting technique is superior -- but will the
customer notice? Certainly the company's heyday, when virtually every
child knew that summer had come because they were fitted with a pair of
Clarks sandals, has long gone.
Increasingly, mums are buying children's shoes in the non-specialist
high street stores where prices are considerably cheaper -- often
because the shoes have been made in Third World countries -- and to the
relief of many, there isn't an interfering assistant hovering around
telling you that your child has ''awfully broad feet, hasn't she''?
Clarks isn't the only British company to have been affected by changes
in the UK children's footwear market. Earlier this month, Chatterbox
Shoes near Leicester announced it was to close its last remaining
factory with the loss of 95 jobs because of ''competition from cheap
imports''. Until five years ago the company, which was set up in 1921,
employed 180 people and made 20,000 pairs of shoes a week.
Of course, what really pulled the rug from under the British shoe
trade was the trainer -- invariably imported from abroad but, during the
''trainer boom'' of the eighties, never cheap.
Parents, already struggling to pay for an ordinary leather lace-up of
the home-grown variety, were aghast when besotted offspring expected
them to fork out #60 and more for a jumped-up gym shoe that had been
manufactured in the Far East for the equivalent, in many cases, of a
bowl of rice.
Alan Cork, editor of the London-based trade magazine Shoe and Leather
News, wryly explained that the big sports shoe companies needed to
charge a lot for their trainers because the cost of promoting them was
so enormous!
He believes, however, that the trainer boom is now over -- and for
evidence of that you need look no further than your nearest sports shop
where the venerable Reebok, child size, can now be purchased for as
little as #16.99.

Will a new cheese please? Lesley Duncan investigates.
ANEW British cheese was launched nationally this week. In spite of the
demise of the last major new British cheese, the unfortunately named
Lymeswold (a victim of success and production problems rather than
public rejection), its makers have high hopes for it. It's called
Churnton. Its logo shows a whiskered milkman and a boy in short trousers
in front of old-fashioned milk churns. Hence, presumably, the name.
We're in Hovis-style country here, with traditional goodness the
subliminal message.
The Cheese Company, which owns the Lockerbie creamery, sees a gap in
the market for non-cheddar Churnton, which it describes as mild and
fresh-tasting with a distinctive flavour. Handmade in the traditional
way, it has been extensively market-tested. A #3m advertising campaign
is backing it.
But will this cheese please? There were mixed reactions from a random
group of Herald tasters.
Willie, an addict of blue cheese of any description, pronounced it
''soapy''. He also didn't like the name. Jack, in contrast, found it
''quite tasty''. Anne, who usually buys mild cheddar, thought it had ''a
very pleasant taste -- creamy, slightly tangy''. Ann without the ''e''
disapproves of full-fat cheeses anyway, said it reminded her of
Wensleydale, but was much nicer than cheddar.
Roy, whose taste runs to goat's cheese or ''good farm cheddar from
Orkney'', found it ''soft and squidgy'', thought its first taste was
quite nice, but that it faded quite quickly. He did add that his
children would like it. The third Anne's favourite cheeses are Stilton
and the Italian Dolcelatte. ''This tastes very much like rubbery EU
cheddar, she pronounced sternly. ''It's the sort of cheese I find
completely characterless but which my children adore.''
Bob thought Churnton ''slightly chewy'' and ''quite acceptable''.
Keith, who likes Jarlsberg, found it ''a little waxy for my taste; none
the less it's not as bland as it initially appears, with the back-of-the
mouth tang of a more mature cheddar.''
As for me, I too have a penchant for stronger fare, but found that a
finger of Churnton with a crisp bread and a carton of fresh fruit salad
made a very satisfactory desktop lunch.

DETECTIVES investigating the murder of convicted child molester
Lawrence Leydon, of Southhouse Medway, Edinburgh, yesterday asked people
who knew him to contact them. Mr Leydon is known to have been at a local

Superintendent Alec Brown, who is leading the investigation, said: ''In
spite of much speculation about Mr Leydon's background, there is still
little factual evidence to suggest this was purely a revenge attack.''

NATIONAL lottery organisers Camelot, which began erecting a new
satellite link on the top of Woolworths in St David's Street, Brechin in

James McKillop uncovers a sinister force.
FRONT-line troops from a neo-fascist organisation known as Combat 18
were being blamed last night for the mayhem in Dublin.
As much as anything else it was believed to be a staged demonstration
against the framework for peace in Ireland to be made public by the
British and Irish governments next week.
Combat 18 is a force thought to be no more than 200-strong, but one
determined to bring the maximum violence at football matches with
limited risk of arrest to members.
Thereby it hopes to gain the greatest possible publicity for its
cause. It has links with organisations with similar neo-fascist aims in
Europe, especially Germany
It is also said to have a close relationship with loyalist
organisations in Northern Ireland.
Combat explains itself. You have to go through the alphabet to explain
18. One equals ''A'' and eight is ''H''. Ergo, AH is short for Adolf
Hitler.
The explanation comes from Tony Robson, a researcher for the
anti-fascist publication Searchlight. His insight into Nazi involvement
in English football is not disputed by the foremost academic experts on
soccer hooliganism in England.
''There is no question about it,'' Robson said last night. ''We knew
well in advance that Combat 18 were out to cause havoc at this game. So
too did the police intelligence unit. We have had undercover agents
reporting back for some time.''
The Garda Siochana, the Irish police, had been warned well in advance,
he said, and they had been provided with pictures of the ringleaders.
''However, while the Garda were watching obvious routes into Dublin,
the ring leaders were coming in via Belfast and Cork.''
According to Searchlight, there were just over 50 Combat 18 troops at
last night's game, but they were supported by fellow travellers from
Northern Ireland. Once the ringleaders set off the rioting they quickly
fled the scene, according to Mr Robson.
Combat 18 has been in existence for just over two years. The
organisation attempts to goad into violence the hooligan element still
commonplace in English football.
It is known there are cells throughout England that have links with
similar groups in Sweden, Germany, and the United States.
Combat 18 comprises former members of the National Front who now
believe the NFhas become too soft. However, according to intelligence
reports, some members still have connections with the British National
Party.
According to Mr Robson, Combat 18 will travel anywhere in Europe to
cause trouble at football matches. They have been at the heart of
violence at matches in Stockholm, Amsterdam, and Prague.
While the NF was last night distancing itself from the trouble in
Dublin, and probably with some justification on this occasion, there is
no doubt it was their members in the 1970s who were first to introduce
right-wing extreme politics into football matches through violence.
''Sieg Heil'' has long been a greeting between supporters at many
English clubs. The Nazi salute was evident at the height of Wednesday
night's violence.
The English football supporter has long been the pariah of the
football world, and it has been difficult for outsiders to keep tabs on
their activities.
However, the football unit of the police National Criminal
Intelligence Unit has always prided itself on staying one step ahead.
They claim it is largely through their expertise that the violent
scenes demonstrated in Dublin are a rare event in English football
grounds nowadays.
They know the troublemakers, who, as a consequence, tend to stay away
from matches. Cameras inside the grounds have also kept violence to a
minimum. But the police admit they cannot prevent trouble outside
stadiums.

THE front page report (English not afraid of devolution, February 10)
says that in England the constitutional change issue appears to be
''neither a vote-winner nor a vote-loser''. This, of course, has been
the history of this issue in Scotland since its inception.
Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, and James Callaghan all espoused Scottish
devolution as a device of political expediency, not in response to
popular demand. In each case their Scottish votes remained absolutely
static after they had done so.
The issue is kept alive in Scotland today by the speciously dishonest
''75% voted for'' argument based on combining the percentages of the
votes for the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, and the SNP in the
1992 General Election.
The Labour and Liberal Democrat component of that vote, the
''pro-devolution'' element, was 52.1% of the total Scottish vote. In
1945, long before the devolution issue had been invented, that combined
vote was 54.4% and it has remained around the 50% mark in every General
Election since then whether devolution has been on the agenda or off the
agenda and whoever has been proposing or opposing it.
To use the 75% argument to imply that there has been electoral swing
to pro-devolution parties is a quite blatant attempt to mislead the
Scottish electorate.
The independence component is easily identified in the vote for the
Scottish National Party. Since 1964, when the Nationalist vote first
showed an increase, the SNP has averaged 15% of the Scottish vote over
nine General Elections with a peak of 30.4% in 1974 and a second, lower
peak of 21.5% in 1992.
It is all there in Scotland's factual electoral tables but in Scotland
today General Election results are regarded as mere aberrations awaiting
correction by the next opinion poll.
If English voters must become embroiled in an issue which comes as low
on their priorities as it does on Scottish priorities, it is to be hoped
for their sakes that the arguments will be conducted with a little more
honesty.

IT is refreshing to read James Scott pouring cold water on the sublime
euphoria of the Nationalists' political dreams and pointing out the
folly of the Labour Party in supporting devolution for Scotland with the
possible additional lunacy of further assemblies in the North of England
(February 11).
Sad it is to see the Labour Party, commanding the greatest polls
advantage over the Tories for decades, handicapping itself with all
sorts of unnecessary devolutionary experiments.
When one adds the unforeseen West Lothian difficulty, and Mr Blair's
coming battle over Clause 4, the hitherto hapless Tories may do better
than even their most staunch supporters could currently envisage a short
while ago.

YOUR recent report featured another episode in the tragi-comedy of
Glasgow's yawning gap site between the Kingston Bridge and the old Govan
Ferry.
The combined efforts of all the quangos, agencies, councils, and
Government to disclaim responsibility ensure that the boast of ''miles
better'' does not apply to this notable stretch of Clydeside.
There is certainly an over-simplification in ascribing the current
problems to storm damage. In fact it resulted from a flooded river,
swollen by heavy rainfall and a high tide (though debatable whether it
coincided with highest potential spring tide), and aggravated by the
crass negligence of the human element in the bureaucratic corridors of
supposed control.
For more than 100 years the Clyde has been conducted down a deep
channel on whose man-made banks the city of Glasgow has confidently
built its bridging buttresses and high-rise edifices.
In allowing the river bed to silt up -- now perhaps half the depth
that it was 50 years ago -- it is a racing certainty that the flood
waters will find somewhere else to go.
The Bell's Bridge, Stobcross Quay, the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre, and the aptly-named Moat House Hotel experienced the
consequences in December and no doubt the rodents inhabiting the
derelict garden festival site were similarly afflicted.
In the meantime the Waverley, the last ambassador abroad of the
Clyde's lost steamship pride, is impounded; the pitiful ''one-off''
dredging proposal (not seen as a priority by the GDA) is stuck in the
mud; chunks of Glasgow Green wash down to augment the silt; and the
Neros of assorted bodies fiddle with the legalities.

I GROANED when I read Ruth Wishart's article (February 13).
If she feels the church is becoming obsessed with sex it is because
the whole nation is obsessed with it to the extent that someone has
surely to say it is wrong.
Certainly the Kirk, as one of the representatives of Christian belief
and practice, has every right to do so, and I for one am glad that it
has a social responsibility convener who is not afraid to speak up.
Of course prostitution has been around almost since time began, but
that doesn't make it OK in the sight of God, and the Kirk would be
failing in its duty if it did not say so.
A big part of the trouble in our country right now is that anything
goes, and to quote from the Bible on how it was when Israel had no-one
to lead them: ''Everyone did what was right in their own eyes'' (Judges
17.6).
When will people realise that while it is necessary to condemn the
sin, the Christian still wants to show God's love to the sinner, if for
no other reason than that we recognise we are sinners ourselves
graciously saved by the grace of God.
Ruth Wishart's final sentence was a disgrace. It was rude, crude, and
extremely distasteful. I sincerely hope she can do better next time.

ON the question of Anglo-Scottish sleeper services, the best defence
of the status quo must be to press for strengthening the economics of
all these services.
The following suggestions readily come to mind: the Channel Tunnel has
been open for nearly a year and yet through services north of London are
still at least a year away.
Cannot the existing sleeper rolling stock be used with minimum
alteration to provide overnight services to Paris and Brussels as well
as London? This must surely increase demand. With slightly earlier
departure times it should not require additional rolling stock.
Given the number of Scots who take self-drive holidays abroad and the
return trade of tourists from the Continent it seems bizarre that we
should have to drive 450 miles each way to use Le Shuttle. The Motorail
option should be available on all services. However, the price must
stand comparison with the alternative of driving it yourself.
Attractive options for budget-conscious travellers need to be devised,
eg reclining seats with blankets. The channel ferries currently provide
similar options.
Sources of revenue must be diversified so that the overheads of the
service are shared, eg collaboration with the Post Office or courier
services to carry small goods requiring next-day delivery to the
Continent.

THE proposed development of the former garden festival site as a
pleasure gardens during the next five years represents one of the best
opportunities in Glasgow to create sustainable employment with positive
environmental impacts in the rapidly developing local leisure and world
tourism markets.
These would be genuinely new, permanent jobs, integrating various
disciplines from the arts and sciences with strong emphasis on
education, business, and commerce.
The main visitor attraction would be a range of opportunities to see,
experience, and interact with science, technology, design, and
manufacturing on site -- a walk through the past, present, and into the
future of Glasgow and Scotland.
The design specification must include a sufficiently large structure
to accommodate very large numbers of visitors in inclement weather, also
act as a focus for marketing of the city and be of outstanding
architectural merit.
The site would be made ready for December 31, 1999, when Glasgow, with
these new gardens and this innovative building, would host the largest
Hogmanay celebration ever, not only attracting UK media coverage but
almost certainly worldwide attention.
With a launch of this magnitude, attracting local and international
visitor numbers in excess of 1,500,000 per year would not be difficult.
What other proposed project could offer this opportunity to the commerce
and people of its host city and the Millennium Commission?

GEORGE ORWELL'S theory in 1984 that the public can be manipulated by
subtle changes in vocabulary is coming true today.
''Joyriders'' are in reality homicidal car thieves, ''moles'' are
dishonest, disloyal employees, ''sleaze'' (not used as a noun in my
dictionary) appears to be moral decadence.
Phrases such as ''the Government must pay for . . .'' are substituted
for the taxpayer must pay. Politicians are described contemptuously as
making U-turns when they have had the courage to try to rectify a
mistake.
The media appears to have taken on the role of Big Brother in
controlling the minds of the public.

NOW that the salaries of company directors are public property it will
be interesting to see if they create a new social hierarchy. It would be
unnatural if money made no difference at all. One has only to think of
Jane Austen, writing in the days when private wealth was also public
knowledge, to recall that characters with #50,000 in the Funds are
treated quite differently from those scraping by on #100 a year. It made
a great difference, however, where the money came from. She may have
been the first novelist to write about the middle class, but she was
snobbish about trade.
These days it is difficult to know where the middle class begins or
ends. A curious dispute has arisen between Miss Rebecca Nicolson and the
College of Heralds over whether her own claim to be middle class is
justified. Of Miss Nicholson's blood-line there is no doubt. ''Two
great-grandfathers were hereditary peers, and her father is heir
presumptive to Lord Carnock, which will give her a shelf in the Hons'
cupboard,'' said a college spokeman. ''She's thoroughly 'U'.'' But even
her father, Nigel Nicolson, son of Sir Harold Nicolson and Vita
Sackville-West, conceded that while he is upper class himself, living at
Sissinghurst Castle, his daughter may have slipped. ''She is three
generations down, and that dissipates things, like with sweet peas,'' he
said.
As a writer, Miss Nicolson could perhaps claim to be classless,
although like auctioneering, estate agenting, and show business, it is a
trade increasingly popular with scions of great families, who use their
connections to write gossip columns. In the old days journalists were
firmly on the bottom rung of society -- grocer's assistants, as one
proprietor put it, writing for other grocer's assistants. They were
badly paid, even on middle-class socialist magazines. One recalls a
young New Statesman sub-editor, being praised for his work by Kingsley
Martin, murmuring that it was hard to survive on #20 a week. ''Good
God!'' Martin replied. ''You mean you haven't got a private income?''

THE resignation of Chris Green, the head of ScotRail, is a big blow to
the business he was managing so well and a blow to its speedy
privatisation. Mr Green was the most able and dynamic force in
Scotland's railways over the past 10 to 15 years. A railwayman through
and through, his commitment was to the most modern and efficient
exploitation and development of the existing systems. He had experience
of the vital but immensely complex commuter traffic in the south-east of
England as well as the mainline InterCity business, which he turned into
a profitable enterprise. In both his drive and success he did much for
the morale of other railway workers. It is impossible to identify any
group in or outside the Scottish railways which will be heartened by his
going, which is some quick measure of his achievement given the way the
business was rarely in the forefront of new investment or expansion: in
fact some expansion in the shape of new stations in central Scotland did
take place under his leadership, a rare development.
Mr Green was a forthright, even bold, exponent of his own ideas and
enthusiasms for ScotRail. He was not ill-disposed to its privatisation
but he disagreed strongly with Government proposals on the best
structures and operating principles for the company assuming that event.
It must be hoped that his strong expression of his opinions, in
particular as expressed to this newspaper, did not contribute to his
going, though it is no secret that some of those involved in the process
of privatisation felt that he was rocking the boat. The privatisation
programme for the railways will go ahead, but it is the most difficult
of all the privatisations (which is why it has lagged so long in the
queue).
So far as Scotland is concerned, the loss of Chris Green will make the
Government's task yet more difficult, though it is unlikely that our
railway will have seen the last of Mr Green.

A DEVASTATING critique was carried in Monday's Herald in advance of
that night's Great Debate on BBC television. Seldom have the divisions
between our two nations been spelt out in starker or more challenging
detail.
I refer of course to the article by Dr Harry Burns, director of public
health for Greater Glasgow Health Board, who wrote in advance of the
Panorama programme about the life prospects of those who are born into
Drumchapel and their counterparts who grow up a few hundred yards away
in Bearsden.
Two nations indeed, and the ultimate challenge in politics is to merge
them into one by breaking down the prison gates of poverty and creating
decent levels of opportunity for all.
There is nothing trite about aspiration, any more than there is a
magic formula to achieve it. What I believe the overwhelming majority of
society expects is that there should be a steady journey towards it. The
tragedy which this week's coverage exposed is that we are now actually
moving in the other direction.
As the programme made clear, the two nations are to be found -- pink
cheek by hollow jowl -- throughout Britain. The statistics from Teesside
were similar to those from Glasgow, and could be repeated throughout the
land. For the first time since public health was recognised as a
responsibility of the State, life expectancy for many poor people
actually decreased during the 1980s.
Harry Burns pointed out that a new-born baby leaving hospital today to
go home to Drumchapel might expect to die seven or 10 years sooner than
the baby in the next cot who is going home to Bearsden.
I thought about that statistic a lot this week, since I was going in
and out of Yorkhill, where our own little boy was having an operation.
Each time I was required to pass the benign countenance of Mrs Joan
Cameron, chairwoman of the Yorkhill NHS Trust on #25,000 a year by sole
dint of being a Bearsden Tory. That's what's called rubbing salt in the
wound.
It is not difficult to observe the evidence of what Harry Burns is
talking about in an NHS children's hospital which draws its clientele
from such a varied catchment area. The strain and struggle of living on
next to nothing shows through in some very young faces; more so in their
parents.
Denial of reality is almost as offensive as the reality itself. On
Panorama we had Gerry Malone mouthing the platitudes and denials on
behalf of Government. Mr Malone has spent most of his life in Glasgow.
His wife is a GP. Yet here he was, babbling obfuscations about the
complex reasons for poor health and low life expectancy.
Look in the mirror, Gerry, and ask what state of health you would be
in if you were required to live for a week and bring up a couple of kids
on the cost of an average West End meal.
Bang on cue he was followed into the ring by the space cadet who
masquerades as Secretary of State for Wales, John Redwood. It was all
the fault of left-wing media types who make programmes like Panorama.
With all the credibility of a man disputing the invention of the wheel,
Mr Redwood sturdily denied a link between poverty and ill health.
The indictment of the Tory years is not that they have failed to
bridge the wealth gap but that they have consciously set out to widen
and consolidate it. That is not the rhetoric of politics but the
inescapable evidence of the chnages which have been made in the taxation
system.
Boardroom greed is a mere addendum to the means by which the rich have
become richer; although recent revelations confirm that the more these
people are given the more they will seek to take to themselves. The
major redistribution of wealth has been achieved through abolition of
upper tax rates while those at the bottom have seen benefits squeezed.
Between 1979 and the early nineties, the bottom 20% of the population
saw their incomes drop by 12% in real terms after housing costs, while
the incomes of the top 20% increased by 49%; much more as you go further
up the scale. Even these percentages do not begin to explain the
disparity in cash terms.
Every sinew of government should be committed to creating employment
and getting people out of the benefit stranglehold. But if
representatives of government deny that there is even a link between
poverty and either health or crime -- as they equally do -- then how on
earth can they be expected to make that fundamental commitment? To do so
would be to deny their own denials.
This is the great debate of British/Scottish/Glasgow/ Teesside
politics, and it is high time that it was given its proper place. People
without jobs, money, or hope do not only die younger. Many of them also
take such measures as are at their disposal to alleviate their position
while they are alive. That is one more reason why there can be no real
border of awareness between Drumchapel and Bearsden.
Immediately after Panorama had given some rare exposure to the Great
Debate, two politicians argued with passion and conviction about matters
relating to the constitution. Perhaps their argument could be boiled
down to two questions, for socialists at least: Were the statistics from
Teesside any less distressing than the ones from Greater Glasgow, and
would it not be better to channel our political energies, together, to
transform both?

WEDNESDAY'S ugly scenes in Dublin may have damaged England's chances
of hosting the European football championships next year. But the yobs
whose conduct aborted the friendly international are not representative
of English football fans. Indeed, an apposite question is how far
football is their game at all. Their behaviour seemed premeditated and
organised rather than spontaneous and random. It had an unmistakable
political flavour though it might be too much to see in it any conscious
involvement in the affairs of Ulster -- a demonstration of solidarity
with the Unionists or a considered display of contempt for the Irish.
Its very right-wing content (the Nazi style salutes, for example) may
locate the participants in, or on the fringes of, the National Front.
Their hatred may be more generalised than focused, though its English
nationalist element cannot be denied even if it stems less from
confidence, which needs no shrill or savage expression, than a sense of
insecurity.
The Irish police were caught off guard, but they reacted firmly and
took the right decision to call off the game. No-one here will condemn
them: the record of spectator sport in Ireland is remarkably devoid of
violence. And the warnings they had received were not ignored -- there
was a substantial police presence at the game, which was just as well.
Even though the yobs were relatively few in number, crowd behaviour is
seldom predictable. Something even worse could have developed had there
been retaliatory or copy-cat responses. What transpired was utterly
disgraceful, but it was contained before it claimed many casualties,
never mind lives.
Recent events in Italy and France, and even here in Scotland, should
qualify the notion that football hooliganism is an English monopoly. The
political dimension is peculiar to the English version but the
composition of the yobs, affluent and often intelligent young men, is
similar in various parts of Europe. This sociological identity demands a
more complex explanation than that of frustrated political expression,
though that is a phenomenon with a disturbing potential. Meanwhile
football has become far more competitively intense than it was even a
generation ago. ''The game's the thing'' has given way to the assumption
of victory at all costs. The age composition of the crowd may have
changed as well, with the moderating influence of older men being lost
to the television screens.

THE Graham family of Glenrothes yesterday lost their appeal against an
eviction order from their home.
A ruling that Glenrothes Development Corporation could repossess the
home in Alexander Road was upheld.
The decision was conveyed to Mrs Anne Graham, 35, and her husband,
Gordon, 39, by Sheriff Principal John J. Maguire of Tayside, Central,
and Fife, after a brief hearing at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court.
It came in a morning of bizarre events which saw Mrs Graham's lawyer,
Mr James Bauld, departing from the case after stating he had given her
advice, but received no clear instructions.
The couple were then left with no legal representation, as Mr Graham's
lawyers had written to the court earlier this month stating they were
withdrawing and pointing out he had no legal aid.
Sheriff Principal Maguire was asked by the Grahams to continue the
case, allowing them time to prepare their own defence, but this was
opposed by counsel for the corporation, Mr James Peoples, QC, who stated
that they had already been given ample time and the matter had been
affected by delays and legal walk-outs.
The Sheriff Principal refused the couple's plea.
Following a brief adjournment, during which Mr and Mrs Graham were
huddled in conversation in the court foyer, Mrs Graham failed to return
to court -- and her husband told the Sheriff Principal he had no
instructions on her behalf.
While he was not abandoning his own appeal, he then said he had no
submissions to make.
Mr Peoples was told by Sheriff Principal Maguire he did not require to
make any submissions other than to move for the appeal to be refused.
Ruling that Mrs Graham had seen fit to depart, she could be deemed to
have abandoned her appeal, he said.
The Sheriff Principal then rejected her husband's appeal and awarded
expenses, still to be determined, against the couple.
He told the court: ''Lest it be thought that the appropriate image in
this case is of a little man defending his rights against a faceless and
amorphous corporation, it has to be borne in mind that justice is a
two-edged sword and while the corporation may be large, it is entitled
to justice as much as the little man.''
He added that having read Sheriff Gail Patrick's lengthy stated case
on last year's eviction hearing ''it would seem to me to be difficult
for anyone to argue that the sheriff was unreasonable to come to the
view she did''.
In any case, no submissions to that effect had been made to him, and
he would therefore refuse the appeal.
No eviction attempt is likely to be made for at least a month until
expenses in the case have been finalised. However, Mr Graham could
appeal to the Court of Session if granted permission to do so by the
Sheriff Principal.
He left the court refusing to comment, joining his wife in the
family's van before driving off.
During last year's eviction action, raised by the corporation on the
grounds that the Grahams had breached their tenancy agreement and were
involved in persistent anti-social behaviour, it was claimed residents
of Alexander Road had suffered years of misery at the hands of some of
the family.
It was told that sheriff officers who attempted to carry out a
previous eviction for rent arrears had been pelted by metal objects and
excrement, and the door handle of the barricaded house had been
electrified.
Ruling that the couple could be evicted, Sheriff Patrick found the
family had shown a total disregard of the conditions of tenancy.
In her judgment, she added that the evidence disclosed a lengthy
history of persistent and serious anti-social conduct by Mr Graham and
his sons over a period of many years, adding that she had taken account
of the fact that this conduct was deliberate, resulting in considerable
distress to many people from tiny children to the elderly, all of whom
had done nothing to attract the unwelcome attentions of the Graham
family.
A spokesman for the corporation said: ''As this case has not yet been
finalised we are making no official comment.''

With help from the experts, Kirsty Scott examines the mind of the
English thug and how it differs from his Scottish counterpart.
BEHIND the deadened eyes, curled fists, and flailing feet, the English
football hooligan is driven by a deeply ingrained racial hatred and a
culture of violence surrounding the game, according to behavioural
experts.
Psychological profiles of the typical thug generally come up with the
same print-out: male, working class, low achiever, right-wing,
pack-minded, and dependent on the support of others for social status.
Rogan Taylor of Liverpool University's Football Research Unit has
studied the culture of football violence for a number of years.
He believes the kind of behaviour that erupted on Wednesday night at
Lansdowne Road is part of a wider malaise of xenophobia and violence
that affects England as a country and is being exploited in the stadiums
by the far-right.
Taylor said: ''This kind of thing runs very deeply in English society;
not British, but English society. We saw in Dublin what was a rather big
eruption, but it's something that goes on every day in every town and
city in the country.
''It's not about the way people behave at football matches; it's about
the way people behave, full stop.
''At Lansdowne Road I think we saw a game hijacked for political
reasons by a reasonably well-organised group of 40 or 50 people. It's
like dry tinder. You flash a spark and off it goes. It's an awful cycle
and a vicious cycle.
''When it goes off, children get hurt and upset and the police get
very, very angry. That drives on the English fans, who may have fascists
whispering in their ears.''
Taylor said that in general the English, from MPs through to ordinary
members of the public, could be ''very disparaging about Johnny
foreigner.''
Standing back from the Dublin incident, he said, the behaviour of some
of the fans mirrored that which might have been seen as positive during
the days of the British Empire.
''If you were up the Khyber Pass in the nineteenth century you would
want these people with you because they fight shoulder to shoulder . . .
these are the qualities that built the British Empire in a different
context and in different circumstances.
''When you stand among people like this you realise you are witnessing
something that in other circumstances and other contexts would be seen
as the bulldog spirit, the Briton standing alone. Here, it is on the
playing field; anarchic, destructive, but nonetheless attracting the
attention of the world.''
However, Professor James Mangan, director for the International Centre
for Socialisation and Sport at Strathclyde University, does not believe
that xenophobia was the root for the problem.
The professor, who staged a conference on football violence in
conjunction with the World Cup last year, said hooliganism was a
phenomenon of Western Europe and happened at all levels of the game.
''I would have thought we should look to expressions of misguided
masculinity and demonstrations of perverted self-esteem . . . in
situations that bring maximum visibility.
''I think that's more significant. I don't know how much nationalism
has to do with it. Remember this takes place within nations as well as
at local football grounds.''
According to Glasgow University sociologist Bert Moorhouse, Scotland
has not suffered from football hooliganism to the same extent as England
because Scots do not consider themselves to be superior to the rest of
the world.
He said: ''I don't think the Scots have ever had the same relation to
right-wing ideology or to that kind of English superiority.
''Scots are more inclined to think of themselves as one of the
oppressed races, rather than a superior race. I think there is something
in English culture in particular that sets itself up as superior.''
Moorhouse said people should not be too surprised at the outbreak of
violence at the Irish match, because it had become part of the game.
''I think violence around English football games has become part of
the tradition of football. It's become kind of accepted. There is
nothing unusual in it.
''There is violence all through the game of football; managers
screaming on the sidelines, refereees being questioned at every
decision, Eric Cantona jumping at people with double-foot tackles. There
is violence at all levels of football -- I think it's probably endemic
now. It is part of the tradition.''
Looking ahead to next year's European Championships, Moorhouse said he
had always thought staging the event in England would be dangerous.
''What happened last night will be a calling card. It will send a
message out to various groups on the Continent . . . I always thought
there was likely to be violence and I see no reason to change that
opinion now . . . where England go, violence will follow.''

New image could easily slip back, as Ken Smith found out from players'
chief.
WHILE Scots wallowed in the schadenfreude of watching English football
yobs embarrass their country yet again, Tony Higgins, secretary of the
Scottish Professional Footballers Association, warned: ''We cannot rest
on our laurels in Scotland.''
Football hooliganism has been curbed considerably in Scotland since
1980, when the Criminal Justice Act halted the taking of alcohol into
grounds and also stopped overtly drunk people from being admitted. Then
came the Taylor Report, which is turning premier league grounds into
all-seated stadiums, thus diminishing the mob instinct of thousands of
fans all standing and swaying together.
Better stewarding and policing of grounds, and the attraction of more
women and children to matches, has also helped. But there are concerns
that the extra security measures may be moving some of the violence out
into the streets.
The cosy assumption that all was well in Scottish football was shaken
earlier this month when there were 44 arrests in Glasgow's Gallowgate
after Dundee United supporters clashed with Rangers fans. It is believed
a busload of supporters from Dundee arrived too late for the match at
Ibrox and went drinking instead. Fights broke out, with witnesses
claiming knives, sticks, and coshes were brandished.
The previous month, 41 people were arrested in Auchterarder when
supporters of junior club Lochee United, returning from a cup-tie,
confronted Motherwell supporters on their way home from a match in
Dundee. The rival fans clashed in a pub car park in the small town.
Higgins says we must be ''very vigilant'' in Scotland. Although the
image of the game has been cleaned up to a great degree, it is something
that has to be constantly worked at, he says, otherwise it could easily
slip back.
Perhaps the biggest difference between Scotland and England has been
the rise of extremist right-wing groups in England who use football
grounds as recruiting areas and places to plan the occasional ruckus.
They play on fears of unemployment among the largely white, working
class supporters, and try to convince them that immigration is to blame
for their situation.
Although the British National Party, and before that the National
Front, made attempts to recruit at Ibrox, they appeared to have little
effect. No doubt Scots still blame the Tory Government for most of their
ills, rather than persecuting minorities.
But as Higgins points out, the level of racial incidents is rising in
Scotland, so it cannot be assumed that it will not find a home at
Scottish football grounds. His own association has worked closely with
the Campaign for Racial Equality to campaign against racism in football.
At Ibrox, operations executive Alistair Hood said groups such as the
NF had had little effect, and were kept as far as possible from the
environs of the ground.
It is inside Ibrox where the reduction in violence is most marked.
Having fans seated has greatly reduced the sheer pack mentality of
people who may have embraced trouble in the past. But Hood also praises
the responsible attitude of the fans themselves, and his new weapon of
advanced technology.
''The vast majority of fans are not prepared to tolerate misbehaviour.
I will get at least half a dozen phone calls after a match from people
who report their fellow supporters for behaviour that is not
acceptable,'' he explained.
''With 34,000 of the 47,000 attending holding season tickets, it is
easy to identify the seat they were sitting in. I can key it up in the
computer, get their address, and tell them to come in and see me.''
In his eight years at Ibrox, Hood has had about 300 such ''chats.''
Most are for very minor misdemeanours, and a warning suffices. In more
serious cases, Rangers as a club are willing to take a holder's season
ticket away.
''No fan wants to lose his season ticket,'' Hood said. ''Some have
told me they would rather go to prison than lose their season ticket
book.''
It is outside the ground that Rangers have no jurisdiction. Hood said,
however, that some isolated incidents of violence are caused by
''hardened criminals'' who may wear a football top or scarf, but have no
intention of even going to a game. He cited trouble at Slateford in
Edinburgh when there was a battle between youths with Rangers colours
and those with the green of Hibernian. ''It had nothing to do with
football,'' he said. ''None of them had tickets for the game.''
At international level, Scotland basks in the glow of winning awards
for the friendliness of its fans abroad. This may be due to what could
be called the Andy Roxburgh Effect, and now the Craig Brown Effect.
Recent Scotland managers have done little to light the passions of the
fans, who now travel more to enjoy themselves than expecting a win.
SFA security adviser David McLaren explained that they are the only
source for tickets in Scotland and sell only to members of the Scotland
Travel Club -- although they cannot stop fans buying tickets locally.
Each foreign game involves a fair amount of pre-planning, with
officials going out six weeks earlier to discuss security with local
police and stadium officials. Even the places where buses can park are
worked out so that fans have the shortest distance to walk to get to
their seats.
''The Scots fans, like the Irish, want to enjoy themselves, maybe have
a drink with their pals. It's perhaps just a cultural thing,'' McLaren
said.
''They don't seem to have any political affiliation, which can happen
in England. If there's any trouble, it usually emanates from too much
drink. But there are very few arrests. There were 18,000 Scots fans in
Italy for the World Cup in 1990 and there was only one arrest.''
At a police level, there is no Scottish equivalent of the National
Football Intelligence Unit in England. Instead, the Scottish forces
exchange information on known troublemakers, but there is no need
identified for a central register of such people.
The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland does have a
football sub-committee which discusses the policing of football grounds,
and it intends to liaise with the National Football Intelligence Unit if
Scotland qualifies for the European Championships in England.
It seems that Scots can take some pride in their behaviour. But all
the authorities are aware that it can take only one incident to drag
Scotland down to the level of England.

<TEXT>
A MAN who attempted to rob a Fife branch of the Clydesdale Bank using
an imitation gun was jailed for 30 months yesterday when he appeared at
Cupar Sheriff Court.
The court heard that Robert Allen, 29, was arrested by police after
his girlfriend, who worked for another branch of the bank, tipped off
officers as to his whereabouts.
Allen, of Dalmuir, Glasgow, admitted attempting to rob the Newport
branch of the bank in March last year and producing an imitation
firearm. He also pled guilty to being in possession of the replica
weapon with intent to commit a robbery.
Mr Edward Russell, prosecuting, said that the accused had earlier told
his girlfriend he thought it would be ''easy'' to rob a bank and had
shown her the replica gun.
He added that on March 28 last year Allen entered the bank and
approached a woman teller. He handed over a paper bag and ordered her to
fill it with money.
However, despite repeated demands from the accused, the teller refused
and activated an alarm before Allen left.
During the robbery attempt, Allen was filmed by a remote control
camera.
The fiscal told the court that Allen informed his girlfriend of the
robbery attempt but she failed to report it to bank officials or to the
police.
However, acting on information two weeks later, the police searched
his home and following other inquiries managed to track down his
girlfriend, who confirmed his involvement.
She later told officers she was due to meet Allen in a bar on a
particular date. The officers turned up instead to arrest him.
A defence advocate described Allen's actions as ''a pretty pathetic
and poor attempt at armed robbery''.
He said his client had suffered several ''personal disasters''
including the death of his father and his wife leaving him for another
man.
He was also experiencing severe financial difficulties at the time of
the offence.
At the same hearing, Allen's brother, Peter, 30, of the same address,
admitted committing a breach of the peace in a police vehicle in Fife on
April 15 last year. He was fined #150.

Error of judgment blamed for circus acrobat's death
AN acrobat told an inquest yesterday how he had watched his partner
plunge to his death before a horrified audience.
Wheel of Death performer Neville Campbell, 20, died after breaking his
wrists, blacking out, and falling 15ft head first to the ground at
Blackpool Tower Circus.
An inquest jury in Blackpool, Lancashire, returned an accident
verdict.
''The accident occurred purely as a result of an error of judgment by
Neville, despite his vast amount of experience on the apparatus,'' his
partner, New Zealander Bryan Donaldson, told the hearing.
The two men were performing on the equipment before a 600-strong
Boxing Day audience.
Both were doing tricks inside and outside two stainless steel
cylinders revolving around a central axle supported by stanchions.
''Neville lost his footing. It is imperative that the artiste
maintains his position in the centre of the wheel but he was slightly
too far forward,'' Mr Donaldson told the jury of three women and five
men.
''As he stumbled, he went to grab hold of the central stanchions and
he must have struck both his wrists on the stanchions.
''I saw his wrists go limp. I slowed the wheels the best I could.
Neville retained his balance. He went forward as if to get off the
wheel.
''His chest went against the wheel. He went to get hold of the
stanchions but as he did so his wrists seemed to give way.''
A doctor in the audience found Mr Campbell still breathing but
unconscious. He died shortly afterwards despite resuscitation attempts.
Dr Karen Carr, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, told the inquest she
had been watching the show with her family when the accident happened.
''My impression was that he was either unconscious when he fell or in
the process of fainting.''
Ringmaster Harvey Sagar told how the two acrobats had moments earlier
gone faultlessly through their routines.
A pathologist established that Mr Campbell died from multiple
injuries, including a broken neck.
Coroner Samuel Lee said Mr Campbell, of Trentham, Stoke-on-Trent,
Staffordshire, had lost consciousness: ''That is why he could not put
his hands forward to break his fall.''

A NEW #7m ferry service between Scotland and Northern Ireland moved a
step closer yesterday with Argyll and Bute District Council giving
planning permission for harbour developments at Campbeltown.
The service, which will run to Ballycastle, could now be operational
by next spring.
Mr David McIntyre, chief executive of Argyll and the Islands
Enterprise, said yesterday that the scheme was the agency's most
important project over the next 12 months and would present be of great
help to the depressed Kintyre economy.
He said: ''A new ferry service between Campbeltown and Northern
Ireland has the potential to unlock major opportunities to create jobs
and prosperity in Kintyre, which has been hard-hit by the mothballing of
the Machrihanish airbase. I believe other areas of Scotland will also
gain from the establishment of a new alternative trading route.
''The co-operation between the Northern Irish and Scots has been
excellent and, while there are still a considerable number of hurdles to
be cleared, I am optimistic that we will see the first passengers and
vehicles rolling off a ferry next spring.''

Scot-FM promised a Scottish view of Britain; it produced Scotty
McClue. Tony Currie argues Scots are the losers.
SCOT-FM, about to launch its fifth new breakfast presenter in seven
months on the air, is a bad joke. Its share of the available audience in
Glasgow is less than that of Ayrshire station West Sound in a city it
doesn't even target, and out of the 157 British radio stations whose
audiences were measured between September and December 1994, it came
151st with a 2.1% share -- the only stations below it were niche London
stations, ill-named Manchester station ''Fortune'', and Radio 3.
Scot-FM has lost all the leading Scots it has paid dearly for -- Haig
Gordon, Kaye Adams, Margo MacDonald, Donnie Munro, Steve Hamilton -- and
appears to have placed all its faith in a character who seems to be have
been contrived from the music hall. Cheap, two-dimensional programming.
An insult to Scotland and no sense of being Scottish at all.
It's 15 months since my company, Radio Six -- like five other
applicant groups -- received a call from the Radio Authority with the
news that our application for the central Scotland regional radio
licence had failed.
The authority had decided instead to award it to a consortium made up
of Grampian and Border Television.
I had no doubts then that their choice was ill-judged. Indeed as Andy
Park -- former programming genius at Radio Clyde and front man for one
of my competitors -- said at the time, ''It was a sad day for
Scotland.''
Prior to that fateful December 1993, the Radio Authority had a wide
choice of propositions to consider. Ours offered a 24-hour news and
speech station. The others' formats were Celtic/rock music, easy
listening music and information, contemporary rock, country music, and
Christian-biased programming.
The authority's duty under the 1990 Broadcasting Act was to award the
contract to the group which -- in its opinion -- would extend listeners'
choice in our areas and which could demonstrate financial stability and
professional qualifications appropriate to launching and maintaining the
service throughout its eight-year licence period.
Yet when the award was made to Scot-FM, its postal address was the
home of its front man, Art Sutter (where did HE go?); not a single
executive was named in its proposals, and not even one of the 13
broadcasters it named in its application schedule ever made it to day
one.
It promised between 51% and 65% of speech content during peak times,
yet its Breakfast Show relies on music as its staple diet. And although
chairman Sir David Steel promised: ''A unique Scottish view of Britain,
the world and central Scotland's place in it at the core of our
programming,'' many of the news bulletins are now mere re-broadcasts of
those originating at local station London News Radio, complete with the
inevitable Home Counties accents and news bias. A bulletin last week for
example referred to a climbing accident ''in the Scottish Highlands''
but could not be any more precise.
But then the Radio Authority is unlikely ever to hold Scot-FM to any
of its promises. Like all quango regulatory bodies its primary role is
to protect and preserve itself. It cannot ever be seen to admit a major
mistake since that would bring into question all of its secretly-made
decisions.
Membership of the authority is bestowed as a gift from the Government
and at the time of the award only one member was Scottish and none had
any professional broadcasting experience. They are, of course, advised
by a professional staff, but unlike its predecessor body, the IBA, the
Radio Authority has no offices, staff or presence outside central
London. The sum total of our interrogation by authority officers was a
half hour -- on the telephone with one of them.
Thus the potential of a powerful new voice in Scotland has been wasted
by a London-based body which could only have selected Scot-FM because it
had some vague idea that Grampian and Border Television were ''safe''
players. The fact that experience and success in television cannot
guarantee similar success in radio appears to have been overlooked by
the Radio Authority. Or was it impressed by the glossy paper and its
''People's Friend'' prose? There certainly wasn't anything of substance
in it, was there, chaps?
As Scot-FM took shape in its headquarters in Leith, chosen perhaps for
their ease of access from Aberdeen, Grampian appointed Tom Hunter to run
the operation for them. Hunter had been successful as managing director
of Oxford-based FOX FM. But although its 229,000 weekly reach looks good
on paper, it's the only local commercial station in its market and
Hunter could hardly have failed.
This bluff, hearty man who claims Scottish roots -- his father was in
the Army and his parents now live in Ayrshire -- has in fact never, in
his adult life, lived or worked in Scotland.
The first programme controller he appointed left ''owing to ill
health'', and Hunter then brought Justin Bryant to Scotland. He had been
a producer at the speech station in London -- prior to its closedown
after failing to secure licence renewal.
None of this should have prevented Scot-FM from achieving its avowed
aim of being what Sir David Steel described as ''a very Scottish
station''. But neither Hunter nor Bryant seems to have been capable of
finding the feel and flow of Scotland and identifying what the central
belt is all about.
They have resorted -- or been forced into -- persistent crisis
management. First equipment failures, then audience failures left no
time for such luxuries as reflection or assessment. Kaye Adams's Sunday
morning show attracted not a single caller one week, and the late night
phone-ins fared little better on many occasions.
Now Scot-FM cites 58,000 callers to ''Scotty McClue'' in a week. Jimmy
Gordon, managing director of Radio Clyde, questions whether there are
that many listeners even tuning in at that time of night, let alone
calling the station. But BT's call measuring system only records number
dialled, not calls answered, so failed calls and hoax calls get rounded
into the total.
Meanwhile, as more of the original team of stars pack their bags and
leave the Number One Shed at Leith Docks, Hunter persists in his
attempts to assure all and sundry that things have never been better.
''It's official -- Fastest-growing station in Scotland'' proclaims an
anonymous voice at regular intervals. Not a difficult state to achieve
when you've started with no listeners and risen to 234,000 in eight
months. Scottish Radio Holdings reaches 1,435,000 in Edinburgh and
Glasgow alone every week, by the way.
Given the opportunity to offer his wisdom to the assembled UK
commercial radio elite at the recent Dublin conference, Hunter chose to
lampoon his rival Jimmy Gordon instead. The most successful man in UK
commercial radio, by the way.
Inevitably, Hunter and his team will go when the shareholders have had
enough. Waiting in the wings is Reuters, which now owns London's speech
radio and provides Sky and GMTV with its news and whose expansive
ambitions are hardly secret. Don't be surprised if, after a decent
interval, control of the station passes south and a few discreet words
in the right places allow it to tear up its original ''Promise of
Performance''.
Yet again Scotland loses out.

Scotland Radio Licence.

LABOUR last night comfortably retained the rock solid seat of Islwyn
in South Wales -- with the Tories losing their deposit in a humiliating
fourth place.
Mr Don Touhig romped home ahead of the Plaid Cymru candidate, Ms
Jocelyn Davies, in the by-election caused by the decision of former
party leader Neil Kinnock to stand down to become a European
Commissioner.
The Liberal Democrat, Mr John Bushell, was third and the Conservative,
Mr Robert Buckland, trailed in a poor fourth, dropping from second place
at the General Election.
Labour's margin of victory was 11,631 down on its majority of 24,728
at the last General Election.
However, with a low turnout of just over 45% -- caused by appalling
weather and a widespread feeling that the result was a foregone
conclusion -- Labour is unlikely to be too concerned.
Reslts: Don Touhig (Lab) 16,030 (69.20%, -5.06%), Ms Jocelyn Davies
(PC) 2933 (12.66%, +8.73%), John Bushell (Lib Dem) 2448 (10.57%,
+4.92%), Robert Buckland (Con) 913 (3.94%, -10.91%). Labour majority

<HEADLINE>Error of judgment blamed for circus acrobat's death</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979812570</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN acrobat told an inquest yesterday how he had watched his partner
plunge to his death before a horrified audience.
Wheel of Death performer Neville Campbell, 20, died after breaking his
wrists, blacking out, and falling 15ft head first to the ground at
Blackpool Tower Circus.
An inquest jury in Blackpool, Lancashire, returned an accident
verdict.
''The accident occurred purely as a result of an error of judgment by
Neville, despite his vast amount of experience on the apparatus,'' his
partner, New Zealander Bryan Donaldson, told the hearing.
The two men were performing on the equipment before a 600-strong
Boxing Day audience.
Both were doing tricks inside and outside two stainless steel
cylinders revolving around a central axle supported by stanchions.
''Neville lost his footing. It is imperative that the artiste
maintains his position in the centre of the wheel but he was slightly
too far forward,'' Mr Donaldson told the jury of three women and five
men.
''As he stumbled, he went to grab hold of the central stanchions and
he must have struck both his wrists on the stanchions.
''I saw his wrists go limp. I slowed the wheels the best I could.
Neville retained his balance. He went forward as if to get off the
wheel.
''His chest went against the wheel. He went to get hold of the
stanchions but as he did so his wrists seemed to give way.''
A doctor in the audience found Mr Campbell still breathing but
unconscious. He died shortly afterwards despite resuscitation attempts.
Dr Karen Carr, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, told the inquest she
had been watching the show with her family when the accident happened.
''My impression was that he was either unconscious when he fell or in
the process of fainting.''
Ringmaster Harvey Sagar told how the two acrobats had moments earlier
gone faultlessly through their routines.
A pathologist established that Mr Campbell died from multiple
injuries, including a broken neck.
Coroner Samuel Lee said Mr Campbell, of Trentham, Stoke-on-Trent,
Staffordshire, had lost consciousness: ''That is why he could not put
his hands forward to break his fall.''

<RECORDNO>979812571</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A POWER struggle between a chief executive and some of her top medical
consultants has been blamed for an unprecedented spate of departures
which has plunged an NHS trust into crisis.
The Moray MP, Mrs Margaret Ewing, is demanding an inquiry into the
conflict which has led to the resignation of the chief executive and two
non-executive directors from Moray Health Services Trust.
Yesterday afternoon, trust chairman Jim Snedden was summoned to a
meeting in Edinburgh with the NHS chief executive in Scotland, Mr Geoff
Scaife, to explain the situation.
Chief executive Elizabeth Hogg quit her #45,000-a-year post 10 days
ago, and was followed by non-executive directors Willie Phillips and Mrs
Marjory Adams.
A source at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin alleged yesterday that a rift
between Mrs Hogg and the senior medical team at the hospital was behind
the row. The source claimed that the issue had come to a head after a
series of disagreements culminated in Mrs Hogg asking for the
resignation of her medical director, Dr Brian Heap.
In the flurry of meetings which followed, Mrs Hogg allegedly offered
to go. But the six non-executive directors of the NHS board unanimously
agreed to ask her to stay.
Mr Snedden and his deputy, Jim Royan, are then said to have met
hospital consultants and ''were left in no doubt'' of their feelings.
''It was not the first meeting the consultants had had with the
chairman to express their concerns,'' the source said.
Mrs Hogg later asked Mr Snedden if she could withdraw her resignation,
but he is alleged to have refused, then recommended it to the next board
meeting, at which only three non-executive directors supported Mrs Hogg.
Dr Heap, who remains as medical director, joined the trust last April
-- taking over from GP Ron Stewart, who quit after only a year in the
job.
When it was put to Dr Stewart that the clash between the medics and
Mrs Hogg was either one of policy or management, he said: ''The policy
has been in place for a long time. You can make your own deductions
about the rest.''
Mrs Hogg was the first woman to be appointed chief executive of a NHS
trust in Scotland and took up the post two years ago. Since resigning,
she has refused to speak publicly.
Mr Phillips, managing director of the Macallan Distillery on Speyside,
has also declined to comment.
But Mrs Lydia King, of Dunbar Street, Lossiemouth, a non-executive
director who supported Mrs Hogg at the board meeting, said she was
scared the affair might damage the trust's reputation.
''A damage limitation exercise is going on at the moment and the time
might come when we have to put our cards on the table -- if only to
protect one person,'' she added.
Conal Smith, chairman of Moray Trades Council, said he was perturbed
by the wall of silence the trust had put up.

Michael Fry turns the pages of a new history of Glasgow
AGLASWEGIAN who takes a dim view of his birthplace may be a
contradiction in terms. But one clergyman preaching in 1757 had no doubt
that the city, so far from flourishing, ''seems to be fast ripening for
a stroak''. He saw signs in the rise of swearing, sabbath-breaking,
public drunkenness, and general irreligion -- in other words, of the
Glasgow we know and love.
His sermon harked back to another Glasgow. This was a city famed for
its prettiness, for the cleanly elegant lines of its towers which rose
amid verdant gardens and orchards by the sparkling Clyde, set off
against the sombre Highlands. It was also famed for its Presbyterianism,
standing as it did in the heart of Covenanting country, its people given
to religion of ''a gloomy, enthusiastical cast'', doubting not that the
dogmas for which their fathers suffered were true.
If hardly a cheerful picture, it must have seemed to the minister's
congregation a fortunate one, because it was blessed with prosperity.
But he did well to point out that it was darkening. By the time this
volume* brings its portion of the city's story to a close, eight decades
later, the prosperity was prodigious, but it also fed on a human
degradation which would have shocked Glaswegians of the previous age.
The most enthralling chapters are the ones which chart this transition
from the brisk and bracing Glasgow of the eighteenth century to what was
already in potential a Victorian city of dreadful night, though much
gold gleamed through the gloom.
There is an especially elegant and persuasive essay from Roy Campbell
on how commerce led to industry, and how a city became a region, in a
unique formula for success which combined a vast manufacturing nexus in
the hinterland with a still vaster trading network in the world beyond.
If the economic analysis is the book's central thread, other aspects
are not neglected. Irene Maver performs sterling work in rescuing the
political history of the city, which has otherwise been almost entirely
ignored. It is essentially a story of how the sort of people in charge
as Glasgow's ascent started, a rich merchant clique, stayed in charge
through the resulting changes. Even the liberal reforms of the 1830s did
not dislodge them: they just swopped party rather than personnel, let
alone principle.
Richard Sher's fine article does two things. It defines the Glaswegian
Enlightenment, both its intrinsic nature and its relation to the wider
movement of ideas in Scotland. Thus, for example, we find much more
stress on the classics in Glasgow than in Edinburgh, which tended to cut
them down to size as merely one stage among several in intellectual
history. We also find unusual emphasis on the fine arts, as in the
Foulis brothers' beautiful editions of the ancient authors.
Sher brings out better than most of his fellow contributors the
resilience into the industrial age of that older Glasgow, and of its
blunt, Presbyterian plain-speaking.
The merchants, if rolling in money, bothered little with politeness,
in either our or their sense. They greeted a speech at a public meeting
by Professor John Millar, today revered as the father of sociology,
''with snipes and vulgar laughs of contempt''. One was so philistine as
to suggest that the university's endowment should be transferred to the
chamber of commerce.
And they found, as would never have happened in Edinburgh,
intellectual soul-mates, such as the crabbit professor of natural
philosophy, John Anderson. He so despised his precious academic
colleagues that he set up what he called ''anti-toga classes'' to teach
the students something useful.
His desire for vengeance stretched beyond the grave. He left his
estate to establish a rival institution, specifying that ''no person
connected with the college or university of Glasgow can be connected
with Anderson's University'' -- which has today become Strathclyde
University.
How far all this reflected what might be called the Glaswegian spirit
is something the volume as a whole could have explored more fully. One
outburst of truly popular feeling came in 1778 when Glaswegians rioted
against, and forced withdrawal of, a parliamentary Bill for mild relief
of the penal laws against Roman Catholics.
In the 1790s they remained studiously unimpressed by the fancy French
ideas behind the democratic agitation in other Scottish cities, but
proclaimed their loyalty to king and country.
It is surprising, in the history of a city which habitually glorifies
the proletariat, to find so little attention paid to the mind of the
people except, in Christopher Whatley's piece, in their role primarily
as economic agents. It would have been especially interesting because
the mind of the people seems to have remained rather bigoted and
reactionary.
But that is in line with the general tone of the work, which is
somewhat austere, stressing the impersonal historical forces at work,
and so lacking a little in colour, even when there are kenspeckle
figures such as Kirkman Finlay and Thomas Chalmers available. Still,
with 230,000 words of text, one cannot complain at the richness of the
material, nor at the high standard of production, though this is matched
by the price. Perhaps the next volume in the series of three, with the
heights and depths of Victorian society to range over, will give us a
more pungent flavour of the city.

<HEADLINE>Praise for Scots police who caught shotgun killer</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979812573</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTS police were praised yesterday for their role in capturing
shotgun killer Colin Middleton, who was jailed for life yesterday.
Toolmaker Middleton -- who killed his former manager Terry Maidens,
34, as he watched television with his family -- smiled yesterday as he
was found guilty of murder at Birmingham Crown Court.
After the trial, the officer who helped lead the hunt for Middleton
praised the work of Central and Tayside Police.
Detective Chief Inspector Steve Hussey, of Warwickshire Police, said
three Scots officers had shown great courage in apprehending Middleton,
41, in the Craigvrack Hotel in Pitlochry in January 1994.
He said particular credit should go to the Perth police officers who
ended the manhunt by tackling the fugitive after a tip from a lorry
driver who had driven Middleton from Stirling to Pitlochry.
The court heard Middleton had called at Mr Maidens's home and was let
in by his wife, Katherine, 27, who thought he was a pizza delivery man.
He then shot Mr Maidens at point blank range. He died instantly.
During the week-long trial Mr Timothy Raggatt, QC, prosecuting, had
described how Middleton had become obsessed with Mr Maidens. He claimed
Middleton planned Mr Maidens's death after they clashed while working at
Linpac Mouldings in Witton, Birmingham.
Middleton was particularly enraged when he was moved to day shifts,
and suffered a small loss of wages.
The clash came to a head when Mr Maidens reported Middleton for
kicking a factory door on November 9, 1993.
Middleton went off sick -- severing all connection with the firm until
he arrived at Mr Maidens's home on January 26 last year.
After the murder Middleton fled to Cheshire and then north to
Scotland. After a tip-off, three detective constables based at Perth,
Shonagh Boyle, 28, Colin Lorimer, 35, and Greig Steele, 28, managed to
overpower Middleton in the Pitlochry hotel.

A PEST-CONTROL surveyor who claimed she was sacked after she rejected
her employer's amorous advances has lost her claim of unfair dismissal.
Miss Jane Vigurs, 37, from Stonehaven, claimed she was dismissed
because she spurned Mr Iain Lawson, a partner with Aberpest of Aberdeen
and a member of the SNP's national executive committee.
Mr Lawson denied he had made any amorous advances.
The Aberdeen tribunal was told Miss Vigurs was dismissed because of
her poor sales record and her attitude towards colleagues. The firm
claimed she had become unreliable and abusive.
Miss Vigurs claimed that eight months before her dismissal Mr Lawson
-- also of Pest Protection Services in Paisley -- had asked her if she
was interested in a sales job. She was interviewed by Mr Lawson's
business partner, Mr Peter Stewart, and it was agreed she'd work from
home.
Several months later sales declined and she stopped earning
commission. She was then off work for hospital treatment and when she
returned told Mr Stewart she was unable to call on customers because she
had no money for petrol.
The tribunal heard Miss Vigurs was paid a monthly float for expenses
and, it was claimed, had been sent money a few days earlier. She later
phoned demanding commission for a sale which, the tribunal heard, had
not been completed, and was sacked after she became abusive towards Mr
Lawson.
Miss Vigurs, of Provost Barclay Drive, Stonehaven, denied she had been
abusive. She admitted calling Mr Lawson ''a bastard'' after she was
dismissed.
She alleged the real reason for her sacking was because she rejected
his advances.
The tribunal said there was ample evidence to suggest the reason for
Miss Vigurs's dismissal was not the conduct she alleged against Mr
Lawson and there was no evidence to suggest it was.

HOLLYWOOD stars are supporting Scotland in a way that could be worth
millions of pounds to the tourist industry, it was claimed yesterday.
The Scottish Tourist Board said Scotland had never been promoted
worldwide on such a scale as a result of four films, shot in the
country, being marketed and released.
The STB, which has just published its overseas guide in seven
languages, says it is standing by for an influx of visitors in the wake
of the country's scenery and imagery being seen by millions of
cinema-goers around the world.
Rob Roy, starring Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange, opens around the
world this spring. It will be followed by Braveheart with Mel Gibson,
Mary Reilly starring Julia Roberts, and Loch Ness with Ted Danson.
The STB's chief executive, Mr Derek Reid, said the marketing budget
for Rob Roy alone was more than $20m.
''We are doing what we can to convert the interest in Scotland that
will follow into tourism trips,'' said Mr Reid.
The industry is worth #2000m annually and provides 170,000 jobs in
Scotland.

EMPLOYEES of the newly formed Scottish Coal Company Ltd were invited
yesterday to dig deep into their pockets and invest in their future.
About 1000 staff based at the Longannet deep mine, nine open-cast
sites, and the company headquarters in Edinburgh, have been given the
chance to take part in a share-purchase scheme.
Backed by all unions, it allows workers to buy a 12% stake in their
company. Employees can buy a minimum of 1000 #1 shares. The maximum per
employee is 20,000 shares. Staff will also receive a number of free
shares, thought to be around 200.
To encourage the workforce to participate in the venture, an unnamed
Scottish bank will offer personal loans at substantially reduced rates.
Throughout the coming month, senior company personnel, including Dr
Ian Preston, chairman-designate, trade union representatives, bank
staff, and Unity Corporate Advisers Ltd, an independent company brought
in to assist with the scheme, will outline the share-purchase proposal.
Speaking yesterday during a visit to an open cast mine at Shotts, Dr
Preston explained that the company was keeping its promise to offer
staff a stake in the new venture.
''I hope as many employees as possible decide to take advantage of
this opportunity to invest in their futures, and the future of this
company,'' he said.
''We have shown our determination to make this company a success by
committing ourselves to investing up to #15m in developing the
Kincardine reserves to ensure we will be producing coal to the year
2020.''
Dr Preston described the venture as a ''tremendous opportunity'' for
employees.

<TEXT>
TWO 19-year-old former pupils of a leading public school yesterday
were fined for possessing cannabis but cleared of dealing in the drug.
John Aitken, of Castlebrae Lodge, Huntingtower, Perth, and Alan Milne,
of Drummond Road, Inverness, both admitted being found in unlawful
possession of cannabis resin at Strathallan School, Perthshire, on
November 13, 1993.
Aitken, now receiving income support of #36 a week, was fined #120 at
Perth Sheriff Court. Milne, also unemployed but not yet in receipt of
benefit, was fined #100.
The pair also were accused of being concerned in the supply of
cannabis at the school. But all charges relating to alleged supply were
dropped when the Crown accepted their pleas of not guilty to these
counts.
This late development, which followed pre-trial negotiations between
defence and Crown, meant that 11 witnesses who had turned up for the
case were not called to give evidence.
Depute fiscal Ann Orr said that police were called to Strathallan
after staff had learned that cannabis had been brought into the school.
It was then established that the two accused possessed the drug, the
total amount involved being worth about #40.
Defence lawyer David Holmes said that Aitken was a former pupil who
committed the offence while revisiting the school.
He was embarrassed and ashamed at behaviour which had caused a great
deal of concern to his family.
Mr John McLaughlin, representing Milne, said that his client was a
pupil at the time of the offence and was expelled as a result.
The lawyer added: ''The effect on my client's family, his parents in
particular, was quite devastating and this had a salutary effect on him.

TWO senior officials from Strathclyde region's roads department were
criticised yesterday over the evidence they gave at a fatal accident
inquiry.
Mr Ronald Small and Mr Archibald Sexton showed a ''reluctance,
reticence, and avoidance'' in answering questions at the inquiry,
according to depute fiscal Jim Robertson.
Mr Robertson was summing up on the final day of the inquiry at
Hamilton Sheriff Court into the death of Mr Callum Chisholm, 27, a
police officer whose car hit black ice and collided with a lorry.
He said both witnesses had made harder than it should have been the
job of finding out why roads officials had failed to grit the A73 in
Lanarkshire despite two weather warnings.
Earlier in the inquiry, Mr Small, a Roads Direct manager for Lanark
North and Central, had claimed that surface water did not always freeze
at zero degrees.
The inquiry heard how the A73 was known as a problem spot because of
water seepage from nearby bings.
Thermal maps available to roads department staff highlighted the road
as generally colder than the norm.
Weather forecasts alerted roads officials to sleet and snow showers
and freezing temperatures, leading to patchy icing ''chiefly in
Lanarkshire'', the day before the crash which crumpled Mr Chisholm's car
to a width of only six inches.
Although the forecast amounted to a ''marginal'' situation, roads
chiefs chose not to seek clarification from the Glasgow Weather Centre
despite having a 24-hour hotline facility.
They decided against precautionary gritting.
Mr Roberston said: ''This road should have been gritted, though I
would not even attempt to summarise the evidence of Mr Small or Mr
Sexton.''
Mr Chisholm, of Biggar, died early on March 15 last year as he
travelled to work at Stewart Street police station in Glasgow.
Mr Peter Watson, representing his widow Elizabeth, said Mr Chisholm's
death would go down as a ''day of shame for Strathclyde region's roads
department''.
Gillian Johnstone, for Strathclyde region, said that very difficult
decisions had been taken by experienced personnel, and that reasonable
precautions were in place.
Sheriff Lewis Cameron will return a written determination later.

PLANS to spend #30m extending Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre in Glasgow to meet international conference standards
were condemned by a Conservative yesterday as ''financial nonsense''.
In a complicated sale-and-lease-back arrangement soon to be banned by
the Government, Strathclyde region and Glasgow district intend to borrow
#30m jointly so that the project, estimated to create 900 jobs, can go
ahead.
There is apparently an urgent need to have the facility completed in
time for the international Rotary conference in 1997, which is expected
to generate #20m of income.
But Councillor Iain Drysdale, leader of the council's Conservative
group, warned that extensive destabilisation could have occurred on the
SECC site as a result of December's unprecedented floods.
Councillor Drysdale also expressed doubts about Glasgow being able to
make a significant impact in the highly specialised field of
international conferences for more than 3000 people.
He also felt that hotel and and service industries in the Glasgow
area, which would be the main beneficiaries of the conference, should be
prepared to held fund the SECC development.
''I'm not sure this is a job for local government,'' he said.
But the Liberal Democrat leader, Dr Christopher Mason, commented:
''It's that kind of attitude that has de-industrialised Scotland.''
Councillor Gerald McGrath, deputy leader of the Labour administration,
said the recent Government decision to proscribe buy-and-ease-back
arrangements meant that the council had to act now.
Under the arrangement, Strathclyde region and Glasgow district will
buy the land necessary for the conference centre from SECC Ltd for #5m
amd lease the land back to SECC Ltd for 21 years.
Such an arrangement will enable both councils to create a notional
capital receipt, resulting in a #30m enhancement of their borrowing
consent from the Scottish Office which will pay for the new conference
centre.

CONVICTED murderer George Beattie is to be released on parole next
month.
The parole board's decision was endorsed by Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang after consultations with the Lord Justice General, Lord Hope.
Beattie, who has always protested his innocence, will walk free from
Saughton Prison in Edinburgh on March 16.
His solicitor, Mr Joe Beltrami, said yesterday: ''I am very pleased.
He should never have been jailed in the first place.''
Beattie, 40, was convicted in 1973 of the murder of 23-year-old
Margaret McLaughlin near Carluke railway station in Lanarkshire.
He was released in 1986 but recalled to prison in 1992 after an
incident with his supervising officer which led to an admonition from a
sheriff.
He was released again to mount an appeal, but this was rejected last
November at a hearing in Edinburgh.
Mr Beltrami said he had not yet decided on what course of action to
take, although the options include seeking a fresh hearing at the Appeal
Court or a pardon.
''Some entirely new evidence has come to light since the last appeal
which we are exploring at the moment,'' he said.
''Several ex-police officers have come forward with fresh information.
''Once we have looked at various lines of inquiry we will decide on
what to do.''

Islamabad, Thursday
A MOB of militant Muslims stormed the courthouse where a 14-year-old
Christian boy is appealing against his death sentence for allegedly
insulting Islam.
About 500 chanting protesters wearing green turbans, the colour
associated with Islam, hurled abuse at defence lawyer Asma Jehangir,
threatened violence against the two justices hearing the appeal, and
rioted outside the Lahore High Court.
''They smashed my car. I escaped with my life,'' said Ms Jehangir in a
telephone interview. She later left Pakistan for Britain to undergo
medical treatment for a heart ailment.
At one point in the hearing Ms Jehangir, the most outspoken human
rights advocate in Pakistan, broke down in tears, according to
witnesses. Turbaned hecklers jeered and abused her relentlessly until
she asked to have the courtroom cleared, they said.
The trouble began earlier as Ms Jehangir rose to address the court,
when fundamentalists rose and moved towards her, shouting ''US bitch''
and ''agent of the US and Britain''.
Outside the court, they pelted her car with stones and smashed the
windows with sticks. They dragged her driver from the car and tried to
strangle him, said Hina Jilani, a second defence lawyer.
Muslim extremists have been closely watching the case against Salamat
Masih, 14, who is a Roman Catholic, and his uncle, Rehmat Masih, who are
both charged with writing anti-Islamic slogans on a mosque wall.
Their appeal continues on Monday.
Several small pieces of paper with anti-Islamic jottings on them were
entered as evidence but no-one, not even those who laid the blasphemy
charge, are saying that Salamat or his uncle wrote these jottings, said
Jilani.
''The pieces of paper have nothing to do with this case, even the
complainants say they were written a year before the writing on the
mosque wall,'' he said.
A third accused in the case, the boy's cousin Manzoor Masih, died in a
hail of bullets on the steps of the court in April last year, gunned
down by Islamic vigilantes.
Fears also exist for John Joseph, a British human rights worker who
was injured in an earlier attack on the co-defendants.
Mr Joseph is the key witness in the case against the alleged
attackers, who include the complainant in the blasphemy case, Muslim
leader Fazul Haq, which is next due to be heard on March 16.
Human rights groups, including the British Amnesty International and
the Jubilee Campaign, which has worked for the release of the defendants
since the case was first brought in 1993, have criticised Pakistan's
blasphemy laws as vague and easily invoked by extremists to attack the
country's minority religions.
The laws were introduced in the 1980s by the military dictator,
General Muhammed Zia-ul Haq. However successive governments have refused
to repeal the laws, including Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who has
tried to avoid an open confrontation with Pakistan's Muslim extremists,
a small but vocal group.
So far she has shied away from introducing even minor amendments, but
earlier this week she called for change in the laws and she too was a
target of abuse by the mob today.
Yesterday Muslim clerics filed contempt of court charges against Ms
Bhutto for criticising the lower court for sentencing a juvenile to
hang.
She said she was ''surprised, shocked, and saddened'' by the ruling.
However, she has also said that she will not interfere in the legal
proceedings.
The blasphemy case has created a furore both at home and abroad and
has underscored the government's awkward position.
Ms Bhutto has been trying to improve her country's human rights
record, but if her government speaks out against the verdict, it risks a
backlash from Muslim extremists.--AP/Reuter.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang has criticised a campaign urging Britain
to withdraw from the EU Common Fisheries Policy as using fallacious
arguments and misrepresenting the facts.
The accusations are made in a letter to the Scottish Fishermen's
Federation on the eve of a crucial meeting at which it is to discuss
whether it will support the Save Britain's Fish Campaign, to which Mr
Lang is referring.
So far the SFF has been opposed to the campaign but its English
counterpart, the National Association of Fishermen's Federations, has
joined and the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association, the most
powerful group within the SFF, has been a long-term supporter.
Mr Lang said the campaign was based entirely on an appeal to the
emotions of fishermen and failed to recognise the economic, legal, and
political constraints which make the objective of withdrawing from the
CFP both completely unrealistic and damaging to the fishing industry.
''I do understand that fishermen's anxieties have been heightened by
the prolonged negotiations to integrate Spain and Portugal into the
CFP,'' he said.
''I believe, however, that they have been unjustifiably exaggerated
and exploited by the organisers of this campaign to the detriment of
fishermen.''
He said the UK had accepted by treaty that fisheries lay within the
competence of the European Union, and could not pick and choose which
parts of those treaties it wished to observe.
There was no prospect of an unanimous agreement among the 15 member
states to amend the treaties which provide the legal basis of the CFP.
''Even in that case, fisheries would remain subject to all the rest of
EU legislation, including, for example, the single market regulations
which provide the freedom to establish fishing businesses in other
member states.
''The cost of a unilateral withdrawal from the CFP would be quite
unacceptable to this country, but the costs to the industry itself
should also be recognised as unacceptable.''

EXCLUSIVE
THE ruling Labour group on Renfrew District Council last night
withdrew plans to propose a party member for co-option to a seat vacated
by a former SNP councillor after the Scottish Labour Party warned that
the move breached Cosla and Labour Party rules and could have ''severe
repercussions''.
The group, which has 21 members, had agreed on Wednesday to propose Mr
Danny Farren, secretary of Labour's Paisley Central branch, for
co-option to the Brediland ward in Paisley at a meeting of the full
council last night.
The ward was vacated following the resignation of Councillor George
McIntyre, who was elected as an SNP councillor in 1992 but later served
as an independent member after being ousted from the SNP group when his
colleagues decided they were ''unhappy with his mode of conduct''.
Mr Gerald O'Brien, assistant general secretary of the Scottish Labour
Party, wrote to the group leader, Councillor Owen Taylor, earlier
yesterday, stating that an agreement had been reached within Cosla that,
where a vacancy arises which has to be filled by co-option, the party
the councillor represented would fill the vacancy.
His letter added: ''It is therefore imperative that the decision of
the Labour group be withdrawn and not proposed to the full council and
that the co-option is left to the party that the councillor represented.
Refusal to carry out the policy of the Scottish Party (Labour) could
have severe repercussions for the Labour group.''
Following Mr O'Brien's intervention, a motion was proposed by Mr
Taylor on behalf of the Labour group that the matter should be continued
until the next full council meeting in six weeks and was passed by a
majority.
A move by the SNP to have co-opted Mr Alex Kerr, who is to contest the
Brediland seat at the council elections in April, was defeated.

<HEADLINE>Killer appeals against 25-year jail sentence New legal move over payroll robbery</HEADLINE>

A CONVICTED killer jailed for life for his role in a notorious murder
and payroll robbery in Glasgow 21 years ago is now appealing against the
trial judge's recommendation that he serve at least 25 years.
Londoner Sydney Draper, 46, was one of seven men jailed in 1974 for
murdering gateman James Kennedy during an armed robbery at the British
Rail depot at Springburn the previous December.
Mr Kennedy, 42, intercepted the raiders' getaway van and was clubbed
to the ground with shotgun butts as they escaped with #9854.
As he staggered to his feet, a gun in the van went off accidentally,
creating a panic. As Mr Kennedy came out of the gate at the depot, one
of the raiders leaned out of the van window and shot him dead.
After an 18-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow in April 1974, at
that time the longest in Scottish criminal history, Lord Kissen
recommended that Draper, then 25 and the possessor of an extensive
criminal record, should serve a minimum of 25 years.
The judge also recommended a 25-year sentence for Alan Brown, 28, the
man who fired the fatal shot.
He said that John Murphy, 35, James Aitken 27, and Stephen Doran, 24,
each should serve at least 18 years and Robert Marley, 30, who had pled
guilty at the end of the Crown case, 15 years.
At a subsequent trial, a seventh man, William Murray, 28, was jailed
for life and Lord Dunpark recommended that he should serve at least 16
years. Murray, also from London, was not arrested until a week after his
six accomplices were jailed and pled guilty on the second day of his
trial in July 1974.
In December 1987, there was a nationwide police hunt after he staged a
spectacular helicopter escape from Gartree Prison, Leicestershire.
He was recaptured after 15 months on the run and in June 1989 pled
guilty to offences of hijacking, escaping, and possessing a firearm. He
was jailed for four years at Leicester Crown Court.
At the Court of Criminal Appeal yesterday, Mr William Taylor, QC, for
Draper, said that of the six men, only Brown and Draper were still in
custody.
At the time of Draper's conviction, it was not possible to appeal
against a recommendation by a trial judge in a murder case. This only
became possible under the 1980 Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act and the
legal position did not become clear until the first appeal against a
recommendation in 1993.
In March 1994, Draper went to the High Court in England to ask for a
judicial review of the 25-year recommendation, but Mr Justice Owen
decided the court case was premature since Draper already was pursuing
an appeal at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Scotland.
If that failed, he could always make a fresh application for judicial
review in England.
Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, sitting with Lords McCluskey and
Morison, asked Mr Taylor whether Draper's appeal was competent since the
25-year recommendation was made before the 1980 Act came into force.
The court adjourned the case so that the question of competency can be
argued at a later date.

THE Government last night confirmed it is transferring the operational
headquarters of the Flag Officer Scotland, Northern England, and
Northern Ireland (FOSNNI) from Pitreavie in Fife to Faslane on the
Clyde, with the loss more than 120 jobs.
In a Commons written answer, Defence Minister Roger Freeman said the
move, due to take place by April 1996, would result in the closure of
the maritime headquarters at Pitreavie.
As part of the announcement, Mr Freeman said the Ministry of Defence
would make available to local development company Fife Enterprise a 5.5
acre site to the south of the Pitreavie estate. The rest of the base
will be sold to Fife Enterprise when the MoD finally withdraws from
Pitreavie in 1996.
A spokesman for Fife Enterprise said: ''We are disappointed at the job
losses to Fife but the new site will enable us to develop the
high-quality business park at Carnegie Campus and will allow us to
continue to attract inward investment from companies such as BSkyB and
the Dunfermline building society.''
The MOD claims the switch from Pitreavie to Faslane will save about
#22m over the next 10 years. Mr Freeman said 70 military and 52 civilian
posts would no longer be required as a result. ''We will continue to
consult with staff and the Trades Unions about the detailed
implementation of the measure and its implications,'' he said.
* IN a Commons debate on the Royal Navy last night, Dunfermline West
Labour MP Rachel Squire protested that workers at the Rosyth naval base
felt they had been betrayed by the Government.
She said it had been ''blow after blow'' for the workforce and added:
''They feel that their loyalty has been repaid with betrayal and broken
promises.''
Workers believed public money had been wasted, with #63m spent on
improvements before the decision effectively to close the base. 10,000
defence-related jobs now were likely to be lost in Fife between 1991 and
1996.
Ms Squire said: ''Rosyth workers have felt themselves to be dangling
on a Treasury rope without any firm deck of security underneath them.
The strain and stress has had many effects, not least on people's
health.''

THE WIDOW of murdered security guard James Kennedy last night declared
that Sydney Draper should serve all of the 25 years' minimum sentence
recommended by the trial judge.
One of her daughters spoke of her wish to meet Draper and ask him how
he felt about what he and the other gang members had done to the family.
The murder left Mrs Ellen Kennedy with three young daughters -- Shona,
Elspeth and Leila -- to bring up alone.
Mr Kennedy's bravery was recognised in several tributes. In 1975, he
was posthumously awarded the George Cross, the highest civilian honour
for gallantry.
In the same year, he was honoured with the Glasgow Corporation Medal
for Bravery. Six years later, British Rail had his widow name a
locomotive after him.
The awards gave the family pride, a little comfort and something the
girls could remember their father by. But nothing could make up for his
loss, and more than 21 years later, the pain is still evident.
Speaking at her home in Bearsden, near Glasgow, last night, Mrs
Kennedy said: ''We got the medals, but that can not make up for what
happened.''
Told about Draper's appeal attempt, she said: ''As far as I am
concerned, it will not make any difference to me how much longer he
stays in prison. But he was given a minimum of 25 years and I do not see
why he should serve less than that.
''What those men did deprived my girls of a father --and the girls
have suffered for it.
''I do not know what technicality he is trying to use in his appeal,
but he should serve the 25 years.''
One of her daughters, Elspeth, 27, said: ''I think I would like to
meet him, just to find out how he feels. I would like to know whether or
not he feels sorry for what he has done.''
She spoke of the financial hardship her mother has had to endure over
the years, and the lack of state support for the families of victims of
crime.
Her mother added: ''At least he (Draper) has not had bills to worry
about while he has been in prison.''
The family are Jehovah's Witnesses and say they have derived a lot of
comfort and strength from this.

THE top brass goes to the top brass, according to a Labour Party study
into military salaries since 1979.
Generals and admirals have made a genuine 12.3% gain in salary deals
since the Conservatives took power 16 years ago, while the average
squaddie and naval rating have lost 15.4% in wages.
Dr John Reid, Labour's armed forces spokesman and MP for Motherwell
North, said last night: ''Once again, the poor bloody infantry and their
naval and air force equivalents have borne the economic brunt of
Government policy.
''According to the Defence Ministry's own figures, there has been a
25% cut in budget over the last 10 years in real spending terms. Recent
cuts in support services go even deeper.
''But it is scandalous that the men and women at the sharp end of the
business, the lowest ranks on the rung, have actually lost money while
their bosses have been given a cash bonus.
''The people who fought the Falklands and Gulf wars are poorer now
than they were in the 1970s. The veterans behind the bayonets have been
treated shabbily, but entirely in keeping with the Tory concept of
society.''

to a gospel choir from Los Angeles in a personal royal command
performance at St James's Palace.
The choir from Crenshaw Elite High School, in the violent and deprived
South Central district of Los Angeles, belted out gospel songs in the
Queen Anne state-room -- normally the scene of sedate royal dinners and
presentations.
The Prince had invited the 70-strong choir to sing for him after he
heard it was coming to Europe this month.
He had heard the choir sing during a visit to Los Angeles last
November.
For many pupils this trip was their first outside California, let
alone America.
To applause, choir mistress Iris Stevenson again brushed off royal
protocol to give the Prince a hug, as she had done on their last
meeting.
The choir, made up of pupils, ex-pupils, parents, and others connected
with the school, gave another rendition of its gospel version of God
Bless the Prince of Wales.
Afterwards, the Prince said he would remember the song always.''It was
wonderful. You must teach the Welsh how to sing it,'' he joked.
Miss Stevenson said afterwards: ''The kids think of the Prince as a
friend.''
One soloist, Leland Julian, 16, could barely contain his pride at
meeting the Prince.
''I will be able to tell my grandchildren that I have met royalty,''
he said.
The choir was to sing at Covent Garden and Spitalfields before leaving
for Paris tomorrow.

INDIAN WELLS: Three spectators were hit when President Bill Clinton,
former presidents George Bush and Gerald Ford played a charity golf
match with comedian Bob Hope.
Bush's second shot bounced off a tree and hit a woman on the nose,
causing a heavy nosebleed and a wound which needed 10 stitches. His
drive off the 14th tee hit a man on the leg, but did not draw blood.
Ford's low drive on the 17th hit a woman on the finger.
After the game, Clinton, who lost to Bush by one stroke, said he liked
golf ''because it's a peaceful, beautiful thing''.

GREENPEACE has condemned a plan by Shell to dump in the Atlantic a
redundant 14,500-tonne installation which contains radioactive material.
Government approval was granted yesterday for Shell's plans -- which
would set a precedent -- to consign the 450ft high Brent Spar storage
and tanker loading facility to a watery grave at 2000 metres.
Shell says that balancing safety, environment, and cost, deep-sea
disposal is the best practicable method, but Greenpeace, which questions
Shell's research, says that the main reason is the #34m saving by
dumping over dismantling.
The installation, at which six men died in 1990 after a helicopter hit
a crane and plunged into the sea, was decommissioned in 1991.
The precise site has still be selected by the Government, but it is
planned to sink the Brent Spar this summer.
''One possible option which was investigated closely was onshore
scrapping,'' Shell said. ''However it was concluded that this approach,
involving reversing the installation process, would be technically
complex, involving a high number of offshore operations, and would give
no environmental benefit.''
The company said that a ''detailed environmental impact analysis'' for
the deep-sea option identified the effect of regulated substances on
board and showed the effect to be negligible.
However this was not accepted by Mr Simon Roddy, an independent
environmental consultant who has just completed a study for Greenpeace
on the decommissioning of North Sea installations.
''Out of sight out of mind is not necessarily out of the
environment,'' he said. ''The Brent Spar has about 30 tonnes of
radioactive waste on board known as LSA scale. In the bottom of Brent
Spar is about 100 tonnes of sludge and this contains heavy metal, PCBs,
oil residues and further radioactive waste.
''What guarantees have Shell got that the structure will not hit the
bottom in pieces or will break up on the way down?''
He said there were more than 200 North Sea installations and he was
extremely concerned that others might now argue that they should be
allowed to follow and that all Britain's oil and gas installations would
be dumped at sea.
''The Government and the oil companies made promises when they put
these things in place that they would remove them. US Federal Law
requires the complete removal of all rigs and platforms. More than 900
have been removed from the Gulf of Mexico in depths of up to 150 metres
of water.
''Some of the companies removing them in America are the same
companies arguing that it cannot be done here.''
Giving the go-ahead to the dumping, Energy Minister Tim Eggar said
yesterday that the abandonment of offshore installations and pipelines
represented a large and costly exercise both for the operator and the
Exchequer, and it was vitally important to get it right.
In the first ministerial speech on abandonment since the Petroleum Act
was enacted 18 years ago, he said cost savings by the industry had
played a significant part in postponing inevitable decisions to abandon
installations, but the day had to come.
The Brent Spar was a good example of where, having considered all the
options, it was concluded the best environmental option was deep-sea
disposal.
He said that the Government had to take into account the concerns of
the environment and other users of the sea when approaching abandonment,
but the guidelines also recognised that cost had to be weighed in the
balance.
The announcement of the approval of the Atlantic option will infuriate
fisherman, who have been adamant from the birth of the North Sea oil
industry that all installations should be removed.

HUNDREDS of volunteers will search Scotland's coastline for dead sea
birds when a nationwide survey is launched later this month to assess
the extent of oil spills and illegal discharges.
The survey -- on February 25 and 26 -- is being mounted by the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds which will call on an army of
helpers to walk along the shores counting the numbers of dead birds
washed up.
Carcasses found will be taken to laboratories for analysis in a bid to
identify causes of death and oil sources.
Oil pollution is known to kill thousands of birds around Britain's
coastline each year.
The RSPB says most of the oil comes from deliberate waste discharges
at sea rather than accidental spillages.
Chief executive Barbara Young said: ''These surveys are invaluable in
helping to highlight the continuing regular discharges of oil from ships
at sea.
''The UK Government must press for measures to address this
international problem at the forthcoming North Sea conference in
Denmark.''

VICTIMS of head injury are to have the services of volunteer
assistants, trained to help them cope with the long-term effects of
their trauma.
The volunteers are to be recruited by the Head Injuries Trust for
Scotland, which said yesterday that 5700 Scots sustained head injuries
every year, 800 of them severe.
After their immediate clinical needs are taken care of by
neuro-surgical and rehabilitaion teams about 5000 will be left with some
physical or psychological disability for the rest of their lives.
HITS has received a grant of #30,000 a year for three years from
Strathclyde Regional Council to mount the scheme in the Greater Glasgow
area.
Sir Michael Bond, chairman of the trust, said yesterday: ''Helping
with the problems of head-injured people may sound formidable, but we
can assure those who wish to come forward that they will be well trained
and supervised to cope with the work.''
Under the supervision of a co-ordinator, Penny Keith, the volunteers
will learn to offer friendship -- accompanying clients to social outings
which might otherwise be denied them, respite for full-time carers, help
with travel, assisting with exercise activities, or helping clients to
relearn and improve the basic skills they need for independent living.
Sir Michael emphasised they were looking for men and women.
''Women seem to be more likely to get involved in this kind of thing,
but the nature of head injury is such that most of our clients are men
and they tend to prefer to have men looking after them.''
The scheme's launch coincided with a report by the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation which said that families of young people with head injuries
were being failed by health and social services.
Parents struggling to cope on their child's release from hospital said
they received little or no long-term support, according to the study by
psychologist Jane Hubert.

THE former chief executive of Lochaber District Council, who was
sacked last month, is demanding all 15 council members hear his appeal
against dismissal.
A four-member committee is due to hear Mr David Blair's case next
month. However, Mr Blair maintains this committee is ''tainted by
personal interest'' as all belong to a group of eight councillors who
voted to suspend him last September.
Mr Blair is being defended by the GMB Scotland union, whose Highlands
and Islands organiser Bruce Crabtree said yesterday: ''The charges
against David Blair are totally without foundation and Mr Blair's
refutation of all seven of them will be made publicly available.
''We have called for an independent inquiry into this affair and for
the good government of Lochaber that investigation must still be held.
As far as Lochaber District Council's conduct of this affair is
concerned, the council's decision to suspend Mr Blair contravened the
Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, was without proper legal
foundation, and should not be allowed to stand.
''That decision and the setting up of an investigation sub-committee
was also in breach of Lochaber District Council's standing orders. In
addition, council chairman Neil Clark, who made a personal complaint
against Mr Blair, was a member of that sub-committee.''
Mr Clark, however, said yesterday: ''In the first place I never made a
complaint against Mr Blair. Two councillors who voted against his
suspension were nominated to serve on the investigating committee, but
refused to attend; we tried to get two others to serve on the appeals
committee and they refused.
''We have conducted this whole affair in as fair a manner as possible
and have received top level independent advice throughout.''

Nicosia, Thursday
CYPRUS Supreme Court today announced that the trial of three British
soldiers accused of killing a Danish woman tour guide will resume next
week after ruling that a legal complication had no bearing on the
process.
The trial was interrupted in December after one of the three judges of
the lower court was promoted to attorney general.
The case was then referred to the 11-member Supreme Court, which after
several sessions ruled today that the technicality would not affect the
trial.
The Assize Court will convene on Monday to hear legal arguments by the
defence for the release of the three defendants.
In a pre-trial objection, the defence claimed that a prison guard took
confidential notes the defendants had prepared for their lawyers, and
demanded that the case be dismissed.
The men were arrested on September 13 and charged with killing Louise
Jensen, 23, after kidnapping her in the tourist resort of Ayia Napa.
The soldiers are Privates Alan Ford, 26, of Birmingham, Justin Fowler,
26, of Falmouth, Cornwall, and Jeff Parnell, 23, of Oldbury, West
Midlands.
They have yet to enter pleas to charges of manslaughter and abduction
with intent to rape.
Police have said the three admitted kidnapping and killing Miss
Jensen, whose battered body was found in a shallow grave two days after
her abduction.
When arrested at a police road block several hours after Miss Jensen's
Cypriot boyfriend reported her abduction, the soldiers had bloodstains
on their clothes. A blood-covered shovel was found in their car.
All three serve with the Royal Greenjackets Regiment at the Sovereign
Base Area of Dhekelia in southern Cyprus.--AP.

<HEADLINE>Kinnock backs code of safety for ferries</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979812600</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Brussels, Thursday
ROLL-ON, roll-off passenger ferries will be banned from European ports
unless they sign up to a strict safety code if Transport Commissioner
Neil Kinnock has his way.
The plan is the European Commission's answer to a demand for tougher
shipping safety rules after the ferry Estonia sank in the Baltic Sea
last September, drowning more than 900 people.
The plan will take immediate effect if agreed by EU Transport
Ministers.
''Tragedies such as that of the Estonia and the Herald of Free
Enterprise cannot be allowed to happen again,'' said Mr Kinnock.
''Everyone who travels on ferries has the right to expect them to be
safe and efficient.''
The Estonia sinking, the worst ferry disaster in Europe this century,
came seven-and-a-half years after the Herald of Free Enterprise capsized
as it sailed from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.
The EU executive said it had made today's proposal because too many
companies operating public ferry services did not have sufficient safety
codes.
The Commission proposal would mean that the 15 EU countries would sign
up to the International Safety Management Code -- drawn up by the
International Maritime Organisation -- two years earlier than other
countries.
A Commission spokeswoman said there would be no technical changes to
ships. but the idea was to make sure crews were equipped to prevent and
deal with accidents.
''It's more on how you manage your crews to ensure that safety is
their top priority,'' she said.
The Commission has not considered the issue fitting extra bulkheads on
car decks. That is being studied by the IMO in response to the Estonia
tragedy.
Under the IMO code, management boards would be obliged to have a
person responsible for safety, crews would have to undergo medical tests
and training to ensure that they could deal with an emergency, and
safety rules would have to be clearly established.
''The shipping industry has never had a common set of detailed safety
management procedures covering everything from shore-based management
practices and communications to emergency procedures,'' the Commission
said today.
''The adoption of this regulation would mark a major breakthrough in
ensuring that safety considerations are made an integral part of
shipping business.''
The EU's shipping industry has consistently opposed EU moves to set
its own shipping safety standards over and above IMO rules on the
grounds that they could hinder competitiveness.--Reuter.

Pine Bluff, Thursday
FLAMES were melting a mobile home around him when Steven Hines ran
inside to see if anyone was trapped. Five families are eternally
grateful that for once, the 17-year-old with a delinquency record did
the right thing.
He saved a dozen children aged four to 13 and their two adult
babysitters, both in their 70s, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, by rousing them
and singlehandedly carrying them outside.
Not until hours later did he realise what he had done. ''I got scared
then,'' he said.
Steven said he was riding his bicycle home from a grocery shop when he
spotted flames from the mobile home's chimney.
He called but there was no answer.
The door was unlocked so he went inside, and immediately noticed the
ceiling.
''Flames were moving across like waves on the ocean,'' he said.
''Stuff was melting. It was like a marshmallow.''
One nine-year-old boy died in the blaze, and when authorities removed
the body Steven said he had to turn away: ''I didn't sleep that night.''
At Pine Bluff High School this week, principal Andrew Tolbert wanted
to salute Steven at assembly. However, Steven gave school a miss.
''His attendance has not been consistent, at best,'' the headmaster
said, but added that the boy's truancy should not overshadow his
heroism.
Steven acknowledged that he has twice been sent to state juvenile
rehabilitation centres.
''I was young. I was doing things my brothers do and hanging with the
wrong crowd,'' he said.
More optimistic now, he added: ''I have to leave that alone -- I have
better things to do than that.''--AP.

Ms Nasrin, 32, who fled to Sweden in August, said she missed her

dreaded an attack by Islamic extremists.
The doctor turned poet, columnist, and novelist said: ''My writing is
more important than a normal life, so I have sacrificed my normal life.
I have given up all my happiness only for that reason, that one day
society and women will wake up.''
She denies calling for changes in the Koran, Islam's holy book, in

changes in Islamic law to give women more rights.
Ms Nasrin said she stood by her 1993 novella Shame, about Muslim

Moscow, Thursday
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin today pledged to shake up the armed
forces because of their failures in Chechnya, and told his people Russia
had been too kind for too long to the breakaway Chechen leadership.
He called the Chechen regime so criminal that it could be compared
with Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
In an annual State of the Nation address to Parliament, the
64-year-old Kremlin leader set out to halt the dramatic slide in his
popularity and authority since he launched the campaign in bring the
rebel region to heel.
He did not single out any individuals for criticism, despite
speculation that Defence Minister Pavel Grachev's job could be on the
line over a venture that has hit problems at almost every turn.
Instead he used his hour-long speech to pledge to strengthen the
rouble and stabilise Russia's shaky economy -- but he did not say how.
He also demanded improvements in crime fighting, legal reforms, and more
responsibility from the media.
On the economy, Yeltsin steered clear of any pledges of radical
reform.
Foreign policy also remained unchanged, although he denounced Nato
plans to expand into east European states.
Defending the bloody Chechen adventure which he launched on December
11, Yeltsin said: ''The state can, and must, use the force of authority
to preserve its sovereignty, independence, and integrity.''
However in his toughest criticism of the army since the start of the
war, he said Russian military leaders had been caught unprepared.
''Their failures, setbacks, and mistakes in command are a painful blow
to patriotic and civic feelings,'' he said. ''Decisive measures must be
taken to reorganise the armed forces.''
He said Russia must step up its combat readiness and improve
co-ordination between sections of its armed forces, apparently opening
the way to remove top officers.
Russia is now in the tenth week of the war. Chechnya's capital Grozny
is in ruins. Thousands of Chechen civilians and hundreds of Russian
conscripts have been killed.
''We kept ourselves happy for too long with the hope that the
situation would solve itself and that compromise was possible. That was
a fatal mistake,'' Yeltsin told Parliament.
''But abcesses like the Medellin cartel in Colombia, the 'golden
triangle' of South-East Asia, and the criminal dictatorship of Chechnya
do not heal themselves,'' he added.
He said he was delighted Russians had not been swept by ''chauvinistic
and military hysteria'' while their leaders rid them of the ''Grozny
tumour''.
The war has, in fact, proved highly unpopular with the Russian public,
reluctant for their sons to be used as cannon fodder in a war most
people find unnecessary and incomprehensible.
With presidential elections due next year, Yeltsin's already low
personal popularity has nosedived.
Many foreign and Russian observers were watching Yeltsin's performance
to judge whether he still has a firm grip on power and is fit to govern
the world's largest country.
He read his speech without problems and walked on and off the podium
firmly, looking much fitter than when he stumbled and slurred his words
at a CIS summit last week.
In its first formal response to the address, the White House said
Yeltsin's speech ''confirms our view that Boris Yeltsin is in charge of
Russian policy and is committed to reform''.
However President Bill Clinton has delayed a decision on whether to
attend a summit in Moscow in May, and celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany, as domestic pressure grew to
forgo the trip because of the Chechnya crisis.
* The European Parliament protested over a Russian decision to prevent
an EU delegation from visiting Chechnya next week by denying them visas.
The Parliament also urged ''an immediate humanitarian ceasefire'' in the
Chechen conflict to permit the retrieval of the dead and
wounded.--Reuter.

Washington, Thursday
A KEY defence witness in the O J Simpson trial has fled the country,
and the judge is contemplating dismissing two of the remaining jurors.
The missing witness, Ms Rosa Lopez, was maid in the house next door to
Mr Simpson's, and the defence claimed that she would testify that she
saw his car, a white Bronco, outside the house at the time of the
murders.
Since the prosecution says that Mr Simpson used the car to drive to
his ex-wife's house, and there murdered her and a friend, Ms Lopez's
testimony would be a solid alibi. She is Salvadoran and has apparently
gone to El Salvador, without telling anyone.
Perhaps she will return (Mr Simpson would certainly pay her air fare),
or perhaps make an affidavit in San Salvador.
Meanwhile, one of the jurors is reported to have bet a friend a week's
wages that Mr Simpson would be acquitted. The alleged wager was made
before he was chosen for the jury. He told the judge that he had no
views on Mr Simpson's guilt.
The other questionable juror was found to have a map of Chicago in his
room in the motel where the jury is sequestered. He may have been trying
to study where Mr Simpson spent the night after the murder (he flew to
Chicago), and that would be against the rules.
There are 12 jurors and 12 alternates were ready to replace any who
left. Now there are nine alternates left, and the loss of two more
appears imminent.
The trial will probably last until the summer and will cost the city
of Los Angeles at least #2.6m. Mr Simpson's costs are no doubt even
greater.

<HEADLINE>Major claims manufacturing 'renaissance' for Britain</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979812605</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister claimed yesterday that Britain was enjoying a
manufacturing ''renaissance''.
Exports were doing well and so were jobs in the sector, he told the
Commons at question time.
''Manufacturing employment has risen by 37,000 in the quarter to
December. That is the fastest quarterly growth in employment in
manufacturing that we have seen at any stage since records began, and
shows clearly the extent to which manufacturing industry is now
undergoing a renaissance.''
He was answering Mr Anthony Coombs (Con - Wyre Forest), who
highlighted falls in unemployment and said a recent survey by the
Confederation of British Industry showed exports from small
manufacturing companies in Britain were at their best level for 10
years.
Later, in question time, Mr Major claimed Britain was on course to
have the lowest unemployment in western Europe.
He said: ''Long-term unemployment, whether you define that as six
months, one year or longer, is falling and has been falling for a long
time.
''I look to see it falling a good deal further.''
He went on: ''Unemployment, whether long-term or short-term, has
dropped by something over 400,000 in the last 12 months.
''We are well on the way to being the country with the lowest level of
unemployment in Western Europe.
''Our unemployment rate is already substantially below that of other
countries similar to ours.''
In France, for example, which was the most comparable country in
population, unemployment was just under 13% and static, while the UK's
was 8.5% and falling.
He was answering Labour backbencher John Heppell (Nottingham E) who
said: ''Even with the small and welcome fall in unemployment, in the
Greater Nottingham area there are still 20,000 long-term unemployed.''
The Prime Minister told Mr Heppell of his hopes for future job
creation: ''I hope that will include your constituency, though you
neglected to mention that unemployment in your constituency has already
fallen by 11%.''

FOR a Minister not to answer a direct Commons question is not unusual.
Normally, evasion produces some jeering from the Opposition and a few
knowing looks among Government back benchers and Parliamentary scribes.
Occasionally, a non answer can be spectacularly damaging and Mr Major
produced one of those yesterday. As all the Westminster world and Mr
Tony Blair knew, he had come from reading the riot act to his Cabinet
who, as again we all know, are famously divided on whether or not
Britain should ultimately sign up to a single European currency. Some of
them, moreover, we have heard airing their differences in public. This
had to stop, Mr Major told them.
Unfortunately, Mr Kenneth Clarke had just that morning delivered
himself in a newspaper interview of the view that he had a positive duty
to speak out on the longer term aspects of this vexed question. He is,
after all, Chancellor of the Exchequer.
With all this in mind, Mr Blair had prepared a simple question which
this column insists is the best kind. The Chancellor had denied that a
single currency was a threat to the nation state. Did the Prime Minister
agree?
Mr Major, like the girl in the old song, ''didn't say Yes and didn't
say No'', but: ''I think you would be wise not to misunderstand what the
Chancellor has said.''
The absence of a Yes or a No, or indeed of any positive statement, was
uncomfortably palpable. One could sympathise, though only up to a point.
A simple Yes would have had the Eurosceptics reaching for their guns; a
No would have distressed the Europhiles and also demonstrated that the
Cabinet was split.
Mr Major's reply also took the form of asking Mr Blair a question,
which he did last week as well. As it is Prime Ministers who answer
questions, this becomes akin to a pyschological transfer of power.
Mr Blair said he was ''delighted'' at this new habit and was perfectly
willing to move over to the Government's side of the chamber and answer
them once a week. Labour were delighted, the Tories appalled. Mr Major
made things worse by snappishly observing: ''You seem very keen to
answer questions. I wish some day you'd try it.'' Labour howled
delightedly: ''Now, Now.''
The Prime Minister meant, of course, that Mr Blair should answer his
rather ancient charge that the Labour leader had once been anti-EU but
it came out like an offer of the Treasury bench.
By the time Mr Major uttered the claim that the Cabinet was ''utterly
united'' he was sunk. Stymied, in fact, by his Chancellor sitting one
place away from him. For, in his interview, Mr Clarke had not minced his
words. The idea that a single currency was ''in itself'' some threat to
the nation state was ''wrong'' he said bluntly.
In an academic debate, Mr Major might have seized the words ''in
itself'' and argued that the circumstances in which one entered a single
currency were what counted and that, until you know the circumstances,
you cannot form a sensible view.
However, in a noisy chamber with the opposing factions in your party
and your Cabinet ready to fall on every word, Mr Major, even with
probably the best briefing staff in the Western World to help him, had
been unable to come up with a convincing form of words.
To have put the Prime Minister in that position Mr Clarke must reckon,
probably rightly, that his own position is ''unassailable''. Mr Major,
for his part, has made what must be a final effort to control his
Cabinet. If he fails, he is likely to be regarded in future as an
impotent spectator of a civil war he is powerless to stop.

Gaza City, Thursday
ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin today agreed in talks with PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat to ease his three-week-old closure of the Gaza
Strip and West Bank.
''We agreed that, starting next week, we will allow 10,000 workers
from Gaza to enter Israel and 5000 from Judea and Samaria (the West
Bank),'' Rabin said after the two-hour meeting in the Gaza Strip.
He said Israel was gradually lifting the ban on Palestinians because
Arafat's self-rule authority had acted against Islamic extremists, and
in the hope that such action would increase.
Rabin imposed the closure, barring 60,000 Palestinians from jobs in
Israel, on January 22 after two Islamic suicide bombers from Gaza killed
21 Israelis at a bus stop. Palestinians see the measure as collective
punishment.
Rabin said Israel and the PLO would also enter into ''intensive
talks'' to implement the next stage of their troubled peace deal --
Palestinian elections and an Israeli troop redeployment in the West
Bank.
The Prime Minister said the Palestinians had shown little enthusiasm
for his proposal to grant them immediate municipal and economic control
of the West Bank town of Jenin, without an Israeli pull-out or
stationing of Palestininan police.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres described the talks as ''a good
working session''.
He said Arafat had told them that Palestinian security forces had
prevented six attacks against Israel.
Only last week Arafat and Rabin failed to reach an agreement on any of
the topics discussed. Arafat left that meeting without talking to the
press.
Asked if today's session had broken last week's deadlock, a
Palestinian spokesman said: ''Yes, they did.''--Reuter.

San Francisco, Thursday
THE first successful treatment for osteoporosis has been found in a
naturally occurring hormone which was found to reverse bone damage in a
laboratory study, researchers said on Thursday.
Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become thin and vulnerable
to fracture.
A University of California at San Francisco study found that
laboratory animals treated with parathyroid hormone completely regained
bone mass lost as a result of osteoporosis and may be less likely to
suffer bone fractures in the future.
The treatment with the hormone, found naturally in humans, is the
first found to be successful in reversing the damage caused by
osteoporosis, said Nancy Lane, UCSF assistant professor of medicine and
lead author of the study.
''We see this therapy as a real jump forward in its ability to
increase bone mass and significantly reduce the fragility of bones in
osteoporosis,'' Lane said.
An estimated 1.5 million fractures each year in the United States are
linked to osteoporosis, including 250,000 hip fractures, according to
published studies.
The fractures can lead to complications and death, with more than 20%
of elderly men and women dying within a year of a hip fracture, Lane
said.
Current methods for treating osteoporosis, such as oestrogen
replacement or the drug calcitonin, may help prevent further loss of
bone, but none can reverse the bone loss once it has occurred, Lane
said.
Lane and colleagues at UCSF are to begin two clinical trials with the
drug.--Reuter.

THE Church of Scotland has called on the Scottish public to help put
pressure on the Pakistan Government in a bid to save the lives of the
two Christians condemned to death for blasphemy.
The Rev Dr John Munro, the Kirk's Asia secretary, has faxed a message
of ''strongest disapproval'' of the sentence to Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, calling for the immediate and unconditional release of
14-year-old Salamit Masih and his uncle.
Yesterday the Rev Dr Chris Wrigglesworth, general secretary of the
Kirk's World Mission Department, said: ''Of course we are worried
because the boy is a Christian, but we would be equally concerned if he
were a non-Christian child.''
Dr Wrigglesworth, who visited Pakistan last November, said the Church
of Scotland was not interfering in the country's internal affairs.
However, he said, the decision to execute Salamit was in direct breach
of the United Nations position on civil and political rights.
From tomorrow his department is including a plea for support and
prayers for the boy and his family in its regular ''Update'' phone
information line.

THE British and Irish Prime Ministers are expected to meet at a summit
in Belfast next week to reveal their joint proposals for the future of
Northern Ireland.
However, as the deadline nears, it has become clear that Ulster
Unionists are gearing up to oppose the historic proposals, now awaiting
final Cabinet approval.
One Ulster Unionist MP, Roy Beggs, bitterly attacked the Government at
Westminster yesterday, calling into question the political integrity of
Prime Minister John Major, the Ulster Secretary of State Sir Patrick
Mayhew, and Northern Ireland Office Minister Michael Ancram.
Three other Unionist MPs revealed the contents yesterday of a letter
which they had sent to Mr Major earlier this week after what they claim
was a vain attempt to change the Government's position on the Ulster
plan.
The MPs, David Trimble, the Rev Martin Smyth, and William Ross said in
the letter that their discussion with Mr Major had ''done nothing to
dispel our concerns''.
They stated that they had heard nothing at that meeting which would be
welcomed by Unionists and repeated their ultimatum that they would, if
necessary, boycott the talks.
''We would not be able to enter into talks on the basis of an agenda
which we regard to be a one-sided nationalist agenda,'' they stated.
The letter ended: ''It is a matter of profound regret to us that what
might be a good chance of resolving our troubles is being destroyed by
Nationalist greed and intransigence.''
Despite the mounting criticism of Unionists, Mr Major appears
determined to forge ahead with his summit in Belfast and Sir Patrick
Mayhew will meet the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Dick Spring this
weekend to put the final seal of approval on what has been called the
''framework document'' after two years of political negotiations between
parties in Ulster.
The document, running to about 50 paragraphs, will be sent to every
home in Northern Ireland in an abbreviated form. The Government is
banking on the attitude of Unionist MPs being out of step with the
ordinary public.
However, with the Ulster Unionist bloc of nine MPs, led by Mr James
Molyneaux, already sounding their opposition, Mr Major seems prepared to
take one of the biggest political gambles of his time in office. At
worst, the Unionists threaten to bring down the Government. At best,
they seem set to adopt a negative boycotting attitude to what the
document, agreed by London and Dublin, proposes in the way of
all-Ireland links.
Mr Molyneaux, who enjoyed a special political relationship with Mr
Major, has distanced himself from the Prime Minister in the past month
and is even coming under criticism from some of his own supporters who
claim that he was ''duped'' by the Government into accepting the Downing
Street peace declaration in December 1993.
Meanwhile, the Rev Ian Paisley and his Democratic Unionist Party are
absolutely certain to oppose next week's document and to mount a
campaign against it.
Observers in Belfast see the role of the Loyalist paramilitaries as
being a key factor. To date, their political spokesmen have adopted ''a
wait and see'' approach to the London-Dublin proposals, if anything,
taking a more moderate line than Mr Paisley. Their reaction to the
framework document is seen as crucial to its acceptance or rejection
within the Loyalist community.
Government officials are now putting the final touches to the
document, along with their counterparts from Dublin. Mr Major and the
Irish Taoiseach John Bruton are expected to meet in Belfast, possibly
next Wednesday, to announce their long-awaited plan. At the same time,
the Government will also publish a paper setting out proposals for a new
Northern Ireland Assembly which will be given devolved powers from
Westminster.

<TEXT>
DAIRY owner Robert Haston told a trial at Linlithgow Sheriff Court
yesterday that a council health expert may have infected his premises
with a killer bacteria.
Mr Haston, 42, said that the Redhouse Dairy in Blackburn, West
Lothian, was visited by Mrs Rosemary Barrett on May 20 last year to take
samples for analysis and to close down the premises during a food
poisoning epidemic.
The court had already heard that the deadly E-coli 0157 bacteria was
found in a pipe and a rubber seal from the dairy.
Mr Haston said: ''The only places that this appeared was on the two
items that Rosemary handled. I have to ask: had Rosemary been somewhere
to get contaminated?''
He claimed that neither Mrs Barrett nor her superior, Mr Crawford
Morgan, had washed their hands before taking the samples.
Mr Haston also denied that he had failed to keep proper records of the
operation of the pasteurisation plant at the dairy.
He claimed that temperature charts for a period of nearly six months
mysteriously disappeared after he had handed them to Mrs Barrett and Mr
Morgan last May.
He was required by law to keep the records for a period of three
months.
A total of 69 people were infected by the bacteria in West Lothian in
May and June last year.
Mr Haston and his wife Margaret deny three charges alleging that they
supplied milk which was unfit for human consumption by being
contaminated with the bacteria.
The trial continues.

A UNIVERSITY researcher was yesterday cleared of attempting to drug
his wife after a sheriff described police evidence as ''wholly
unreliable''.
Abdul Rahim Elmegirab, 39, of Sunnyside Gardens, Aberdeen, was found
not guilty of attempting to administer to Mrs Linda Elmegirab the drugs
Temazepam and Nitremazepam with intent to induce stupification last
September.
During the four-day trial, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard that Mrs
Elmegirab gave detectives a bottle of Coke and a yoghurt carton and told
them she suspected they had been interfered with.
An analysis revealed the drugs in the bottle and carton. Both drugs --
which cause drowsiness -- had been prescribed to Mr Elmegirab.
Giving evidence earlier, Mr Elmegirab denied the suggestion he had
tried to drug his wife to have sexual relations with her.
Returning the verdict Sheriff Alexander Jessop noted discrepancies in
evidence given by two detectives and said he had to disregard it.
Noting the ''background of animosity'' between the couple, the sheriff
said he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a crime had been
committed.

Many Clydesdale Bank
branches will have to shut today, union officials have predicted, as
employees stage a one-day strike over pay.
But the bank has declared that neither it nor the union can possibly
say what effect the action will have until the strike actually begins.
Members of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union -- which
represents about two-thirds of Clydesdale's 6000 employees -- have voted
in favour of a series of 24-hour walkouts. Today's action is the first
strike in the bank's history.
''We are confident that lots of branches will be forced to close,''
said Mr Hugh Roberts, Bifu negotiating officer, last night.
He was not prepared to say how many of the bank's 325 branches, nearly
all of which are in Scotland, might be closed by the strike. But he
added: ''We are confident that there will be a strong response from our
members.''
Mr Pat Lennon, the bank's head of human resources, said: ''Tomorrow
morning, people will make an individual choice. That is their right and
we respect that right. We will run the business as effectively as we can
with the people who choose to exercise their right to work. We do not
know how many people will come in, and neither does anybody else.''
Bifu leaders yesterday claimed that developments earlier this week had
done nothing to lessen the staff's determination.
They said that in six hours of talks at the Acas conciliation service
on Wednesday, the bank's management had refused to budge on its offer of
average performance-linked rises of 3%, only to raise the offer to 3.5%
in a later statement to the media.
Mr Keith Brookes, Bifu's assistant secretary, said: ''Members are more
angry now than when this dispute began. This bribe will make no
difference to the strike tomorrow, and we are getting the clear message
that the stoppage will bite.''
The union says many members will get nothing or very little out of the
performance-linked scheme. It is seeking a 4% rise for all staff, plus
2.75% available for performance pay.
Last week, the bank decided to go ahead and impose its proposed pay
package which allows increases of between 3% and 7% for employees whose
performance is ''satisfactory'' or above -- more than 90% of the staff
according to the bank.
The 0.5% increase announced on Wednesday means the rises for
satisfactory performers will now range from 3.5% to 7.5%. The bank says
the extra increase is intended to reflect rising inflation and has
denied that it is an attempt to weaken the resolve of staff as the
strike approaches.
The union already has plans for a second strike on Monday, February
27.

A NORTH Sea diver who claims he suffered nightmares and began
sleepwalking after witnessing the Piper Alpha disaster -- in which 167
people died -- has been told he can sue the owners and operators of the
platform for #250,000.
Mr Paul Heathfield feared that the blazing oil-platform would collapse
on him as he worked on the nearby support vessel MSV Tharos tending the
victims, Lord Milligan was told at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
From the time of the initial explosion about 10pm on July 6, 1988,
until 5am the following morning, Mr Heathfield was involved in rescue
operations, which included putting 18 corpses in body-bags. At one point
the Tharos was partly engulfed by a fireball from the blazing oil
platform.
The court heard that Mr Heathfield had not felt disturbed immediately
after the disaster. His feelings were of disbelief that such a
catastrophe had happened.
He continued to work as a diver offshore until mid-1992, but since
then has worked only inshore.
He did not raise his legal action until August 1993, well after the
normal three-year time limit, and decided to sue only after seeing
another disaster victim being interviewed on TV earlier that year.
Mr Heathfield, of Dereham, Norfolk, is claiming damages from Elf
Enterprise Caledonia Ltd, Union Texas Petroleum, LASMO (TNS) Ltd, and
Texaco Britain Ltd, owners of the Piper Alpha platform at the time.
The companies asked the judge to dismiss the action because it had
been raised too late.
Lord Milligan said the issue for the court was whether Mr Heathfield
should have become aware at an earlier stage that his injuries were
serious enough to justify an action of damages.
Mr Heathfield had told the court that after the disaster he gradually
began to experience nightmares of an increasingly alarming and vivid
nature.
He was sent home from the North Sea in 1991 and sought medical advice.
He was eventually diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorder.
The platform-owners argued that although the consequences of Mr
Heathfield's injury might have increased over time, the injury existed
from the time of the disaster, or at least very shortly after it.
Lord Milligan said that he regarded Mr Heathfield as an honest witness
who had succeeded in showing that at the crucial time he had not been
aware of the serious nature of his injuries and that it was not
reasonably practicable for him to have been aware.
The judge decided to allow evidence to be heard in the case at a later
date.

AN alleged murderer claimed to police that he was absent without leave
from the French Foreign Legion when he was detained following a
shooting, the High Court in Edinburgh was told yesterday.
But Robert Smith, 33, later admitted to detectives that he was a
soldier who, during his 14 years in the forces, has served in Northern
Ireland and the Gulf.
Mr Smith is one of three men charged with the murder of retired mining
engineer Mr David Dunn, 63, after a bank robbery in Bonnyrigg,
Midlothian.
The court heard that Mr Smith allegedly told a policeman: ''The job
was only bungled because of the duff gen I got and the amateurs I was
working with.''
The court also heard that, during a taped statement to detectives, Mr
Smith had allegedly admitted being in possession of a gun, but claimed
it was not cocked.
Mr Smith, Gerald McQuade, 40, and Paul Bootland, 25, have all denied
murdering Mr Dunn on October 19 last year.
The three have also denied attempting to murder Detective Constable
John Duffy and two other men, Mr John Girdler and Mr Duncan Milliken.
They also deny robbing a branch of the Bank of Scotland in the High
Street of #185,000.
Police Constable Michael Stark told the court that he had summoned
help while searching gardens after the alleged murder and robbery and,
when another officer arrived on the scene, he had spotted movement in
bushes.
He said that Mr Smith had emerged from the bushes with his hands up
and a smile on his face. Constable Stark said that a gun was found
hidden among leaves on the ground when they searched the bush from where
he had emerged.
PC David Shilton said he was called out to Dalkeith police station
that evening and told to sit in a cell with a colleague and a detained
man he identified in court as Mr Smith.
PC Shilton said he had told the detainee that any conversation that
took place would have to be reported to investigating officers.
The man twice went out the cell to see detectives and also saw a duty
solicitor.
PC Shilton said he had asked him if he felt happier after speaking to
the CID.
''He said that he had felt better, but the job had only been bungled
because of the duff gen that he had got and the amateurs he was working
with,'' said the constable.
PC Shilton said he had not noted the statement, but did report it to a
sergeant immediately.
He added: ''He was telling us about his past life, allegedly in the
SAS, and service he had seen in various parts of the world.''
Detective Sergeant Robert Jack said that Mr Smith had admitted going
into the bank and being in possession of a weapon, but made it clear
that the weapon was not even cocked.
The trial continues.

THE children's crusade against the M77 rumbled on yesterday when
pupils from a local secondary school threatened to stage daily strikes
if teachers did not allow them to join the Pollok Estate protest camp
for two hours a day.
''If we don't get permission we'll start the strike at 1.30 every day
so we can join the other protesters,'' said 15-year-old Amanda Lang, a
fourth-year pupil at Bellarmine Secondary School.
Amanda, together with classmate Michelle McGaughy, raised a petition
signed by over 100 pupils demanding that headmaster Frank Corrigan let
them join the protest against the road, which will pass near the school.
The children intervened decisively on Tuesday when a small army of
between 60 and 100 marched on the motorway link site in what one
observer described as ''like something out of Zulu Dawn''.
Clambering on to mechanical diggers, they quickly brought work to a
halt.
Last night, speaking at her home in South Nitshill, Amanda said they
had decided to act to express their fears over the safety and health of
future pupils at the school, which she will leave in May.
''The road will go straight past our school giving off fumes and all
that and I don't want my wee cousin to end up with asthma or get knocked
over,'' she said.
School staff refused to comment, but a spokeswoman for Strathclyde
region said: 'The school is monitoring the situation and pupils are
being asked to remain in school.
''Their parents have been asked for their co-operation while the
children are supposed to be there.''
But Amanda's guardian, Mrs Margaret Lang, said last night that her
grand-daughter was nearly 16, knew her own mind, and was entitled to her
own opinion.
Amanda and the rest of the fourth year denied that anyone had
encouraged them to take strike action.
Councillor Tommy Sheridan, of Scottish Militant Labour, said the
teenagers were ''more than welcome'' in the campaign.
''There's no way anybody in their right minds should be condemning
youngsters for taking a positive part in their own lives. We should be
applauding them for coming down here and defending something that is
precious to them.''
However Wimpey expressed concern at the presence of children at the
protest.
Its director of roads, Mr Dan Pollard, said yesterday had been another
satisfactory day in the #53.6m contract.
The company completed work at the Pollok Castle woodlands after
treefellers moved in at 6am, then moved on to Patterton where they
worked for an hour before finishing for the day at 3pm.
Strathclyde Police said their presence was much reduced yesterday in
comparison to Tuesday, when 200 officers were deployed.

Strasbourg
MRS Winnie Ewing, SNP Euro-MP for Highlands and Islands, last night
failed to win an exemption for Scotch whisky in a new European directive
which treats it as a dangerous substance.
It is the second time in six months that Scotch has been affected by
proposed European law.
Last year, the industry successfully beat off plans to include Scotch
as a dangerous substance for the purpose of transport.
If the European Parliament had not come to the industry's aid,
distillers would have been crippled by additional costs, Mrs Ewing said.
The latest proposed law foresees whisky being included in measures
aimed at toughening fire and accident prevention.
If it is passed, whisky distillers and bonded warehouse operators
would have to install additional, expensive new equipment to prevent
fires. Most of the goods subjected to the new law are chemicals.
Mrs Ewing said she had the backing of the Scotch whisky industry and
the Confederation of European Producers of Spirits.
She said distillers and bonded warehouse operators had already
co-operated with other EU directives. ''But now they all agree this is
getting ridiculous,'' she said.
She argued that stocks of Scotch were worth millions of pounds in
government tax and were, therefore, already kept in conditions of high
security. ''This directive is simply not necessary for whisky,'' she
said.
Mrs Ewing said the cost to each bond would be #50,000 if the new
proposals were made law.
But the European Parliament, sitting in plenary session, did not
support an amendment put forward by Mrs Ewing.
The problem is now likely to come before the Council of Ministers.

THE family of a 94-year-old woman, who fell to her death in a lift
shaft in a home for the elderly, yesterday criticised a sheriff for
failing to impose the maximum fine on the owners of the home and a lift
installer.
Earlier, Sheriff Norrie Stein fined Mr Robert Carroll, 46, trading as
Quick Lift Services, of Thornliebank, Glasgow, and CDH (Homes) Ltd, the
owners of Leysmill Residential Home for the Elderly, #2000 each for
contravening health and safety at work regulations.
Mrs Mary Blair, who hadlived at Leysmill Home near Arbroath for seven
years, died on February 3 last year after she fell eight feet down an
unguarded lift shaft.
Arbroath Sheriff Court was told that a door to the shaft was roped off
and that a bolt had been placed on the inside of the door leading to the
shaft. But on the night of the accident, the bolt on the door was not
fastened.
The procurator-fiscal, Mrs Betty Bott, said that Mrs Blair was a
popular resident and reasonably active for her age. She was frail but
did not require a walking stick. Her main handicap was her declining
mental condition.
On the night of the accident, Mrs Blair had been unsettled and
received medication from Mr Thomas Dailly, the manager of the home, in
her first floor room.
Later, he was aware that something was wrong in the lift shaft area
and discovered Mrs Blair at the bottom of the shaft.
The elderly woman died in his arms.
The owners of the home and Mr Carroll had previously admitted that
they failed to co-operate with each other to comply with statutory
provisions.
They also admitted failing to take reasonable steps to protect people
from falling down the incomplete lift shaft, and that Mrs Blair gained
access to the shaft, where she fell and died.
Passing sentence, the sheriff said that there was ''no doubt'' that
the lift shaft required to be properly secured and blocked off, and the
obligation to see that it was done rested with both the owners of the
home and the lift installer.
He added that the death of Mrs Blair ''would not have occurred'' but
for their failure to co-operate and co-ordinate to comply with
requirements.
Outside the court, Mrs Blair's grandson Alan Gavin, 31, said: ''I am
disappointed.''
He added that his grandmother's death was ''due to something which, I
reckon, was incompetence on both parties . . . the penalty ought to have
been the maximum''.
Mr Carroll refused to comment as he left the court, but Mr Dailly, who
is also a director of CDH (Homes) Ltd, said: ''We will be appealing. I
am not at all happy about the outcome of the case.''
Last night, Mr John McAllion MP, Scottish Labour Health spokesman,
said: ''Here we have yet another case involving a residential home for
the elderly which highlights the need for closer supervision and
increased power of inspection of these homes.''
The maximum fine under the Health and Safety At Work act which could
be applied in such a case is #5000.

NURSES' leaders yesterday rejected the 1% national pay award made by
the Government in line with Pay Review Body recommendations and took the
first step towards possible industrial action.
Delegates from Unison, which represents about 240,000 of the 500,000
NHS nurses, met in emergency session at the TUC's Congress House in
London to discuss the award .
Mr Malcolm Wing, Unison deputy head of health, left the meeting
saying: ''It is a long, long time since anyone can remember nurses being
so angry -- angry about 1%, angry about the fact they feel betrayed by
the Pay Review Body and the Government.
''They are very, very angry indeed.''
Mr Wing said delegates had decided to mount a campaign involving
rallies, demonstrations, and marches in a bid to harnesss the public
support they knew existed.
He said they instructed their officers to make arrangements in
preparation for an industrial action ballot should that be necessary.
Everybody knew, he said, that the Pay Review Body was increasingly a
creature of Government and there was no doubt it had been nobbled.
Unison's NHS group executive meets next Tuesday and is expected to
endorse the recommendations of the nursing sector and seek a combined
strategy for pressing substantial pay demands for 300,000 NHS clerical
staff, ambulance workers, and hospital ancilliaries.
Branches would be urged to campaign and prepare members for an
industrial action ballot.
The officers meanwhile would prepare the internal machinery to allow a
ballot to take place should the campaign prove unsuccessful in getting
the Government to abandon its plans for local pay bargaining with all
the available 3% used for a national settlement.
With the fragmentation of negotiations within the NHS, it could take
several months to prepare for a ballot and that was why preparations
would begin immediately.
The rival non-TUC Royal College of Nursing is staging a conference on
pay tomorrow when delegates are expected to discuss lifting their ban on
industrial action.

LABOUR was asked yesterday if a pledge to ban all NHS trusts made
earlier this week by Mr Jim Devine, chairman of the Scottish party, is
official policy.
The Health Minister, Lord Fraser of Carmylie, wrote to Mr John
McAllion, Labour's Scottish health spokesman in the Commons, saying he
had read Mr Devine's comments in The Herald and wondered if Mr Devine
had his authority and if what he said was settled Labour policy.
He asked: ''Are we to take it, for example, that the people of Angus
or Perthshire would see their communities stripped of local health
trusts with control being centralised in Dundee.
''However wrong I may consider it to be, it is refreshing to have one
Labour policy stated so unequivocally. I look forward to your
confirmation.''
Mr Devine's remarks at a party meeting at Cupar promised to integrate
all opted-out hospitals into the NHS health board structure.
The Scottish party will be launching a major health document at next
month's conference in Inverness. There have been suggestions that under
Mr Blair the party, at least in England, may revise its policy towards
trusts before the next election.

MPS with islands in their constituencies claimed victory last night in
their battle to obtain Government concessions on Vehicle Excise Duty for
island-based hauliers.
In a meeting with Treasury Minister David Heathcote-Amory, a
delegation of MPs were told the Government would introduce an amendment
to the Finance Bill, currently under debate in the House, to preserve
the islands' exemption from plating and weighting facilities.
Two weeks ago, the MPs challenged Mr Heathcote-Amory in a Commons
debate to explain why the exemption had been removed, leaving lorries
which never leave the island having to pay hundreds of pounds in excise
tax.
In the delegation were Liberal Democrat MPs Mr Jim Wallace (Orkney and
Shetland) and Mrs Ray Michie (Argyll and Bute), and Labour MPs Mr Calum
Macdonald (Western Isles) and Mr Brian Wilson (Cunninghame North).

A SECOND attempt by Labour Left-wingers to embarrass the party
leadership is being made today as Mr Tony Blair's roadshow campaign to
abolish Clause 4 of the party constitution moves to Scotland.
Euro MP Alex Falconer, who was accused last month of sabotaging Mr
Blair's visit to Brussels to launch an anti-Tory offensive on Europe,
has placed an advertisement in today's issue of The Herald claiming
Labour is attempting to abandon a ''powerful weapon'' for social and
economic progress.
It was Mr Falconer's advertisement in The Guardian last month --
supported by more than half of Britain's Labour MEPs -- which infuriated
Mr Blair and the party modernisers. Several Euro-MPs recanted after Mr
Blair denounced their ''infantile'' tactics.
Today's advertisement, on page three of The Herald, was placed by Mr
Falconer, one of the party's most staunch traditionalists, on behalf of
the Campaign for Socialism, a Scottish body which was set up early on in
the debate about Clause 4.
Its Scottish supporters include Mr Alex Smith, MEP for South of
Scotland; Westminster MPs Mr Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West), Mr Ian
Davidson (Govan), Mr Jimmy Wray (Provan), Mr Jimmy Hood (Clydesdale),
and Mr David Marshall (Shettleston).
Other prominent Labour activists behind Mr Falconer, a former Rosyth
shop steward, are Scottish executive members Ms Rosina McCrae, Mr Johann
Lamont, and Mr Archie Graham. Mr Bill Spiers, deputy general secretary
of the STUC, is also associated with the campaign, which is run by Mr
Canavan and the STUC's arts officer, Ms Mary Picken, who is also
chairwoman of Glasgow district Labour Party.
Mr Falconer says this spread of support indicates that most Scots in
the Labour Party want to retain Clause 4. He has accused the senior
Scots on the national executive in London of ignoring opinion at home.
In Strasbourg yesterday, he was unrepentant about his latest attempt
to embarrass the leadership. The advertisement is timed to coincide with
Shadow Social Security Minister Donald Dewar's attendance at a roadshow
meeting tonight in Maryhill, Glasgow.
The meeting is part of Labour's charm offensive to win over activists
angered by Mr Blair's modernisation moves in advance of a special
conference on April 29 to decide on the new aims and objectives of the
party.
Mr Falconer said: ''It was an act of deliberate embarrassment by Mr
Blair to announce major constitutional change of this kind to conference
without any consultation. That would never have been done by John
Smith.''
He said Mr Blair was using Labour members' money to push his message,
and so others were entitled to raise the level of debate by placing
advertisements in newspapers.
Mr Wayne David, EPLP group leader, condemned Mr Falconer's tactics.
''This is no way to conduct sensible politics or a sensible debate,'' he
said.
Mr Jim Devine, Scottish Labour Party chairman, said yesterday that
Cunninghame North MP Brian Wilson's amendment, which will ask the
conference to give its support to an alternative to Clause 4, also
mentioned common ownership ''so it may be that we are getting a meeting
of minds''.
He declined to say whether he thought the advertisement was a
constructive tactic but believed its wording suggested a positive change
in the nature of the debate with a substantial move towards common
ownership.
Commenting on the advertisement, Mr Devine, who is not a member of the
CFS, said: ''People have the right to campaign in whatever way they feel
appropriate and it is up to the individual members to decide whether the
advert is placed on the day of a conference and if this is the correct
use of resources and the correct tactics.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday declined to
comment on the advertisement but a spokesperson said he fully supported
Mr Tony Blair's position and was confident in his prospects of winning
the debate on Clause 4.
A spokesperson said Mr Jack McConnell, secretary of the Scottish
Labour Party, had declined to comment because he is a party official and
''it is not for him to comment''.

A NEW Bill governing the care of the mentally ill in the community in
Scotland received a mixed welcome yesterday.
It is intended to create a legal framework for the care of patients
who no longer require to be detained in hospital but still require
supervision -- a matter of growing concern as long-stay psychiatry beds
are reduced in number.
The proposals are aimed at minimising the risk of patients losing
touch with their clinical carers, and possibly failing to keep taking
the medicine that keeps them well.
The Bill parallels similar measures being introduced in England in
response to recent tragedies, including mentally ill patients who have
killed others or harmed themselves, for example by climbing into the
lions' enclosure at London Zoo.
The most contentious measure in the Mental Health (Patients in the
Community) Bill will put a one-year time limit on Leave of Absence, the
status -- currently open-ended -- attached to patients who come out of
hospital but still need supervision.
After a year, such patients -- there are currently thought to be about
100 in Scotland -- will have to be the subject of an application to a
sheriff for a community care order, if supervision is to be continued.
The Government fears that, in its present form, indefinite leave of
absence could be open to legal challenge.
However, the Mental Welfare Commission believes the existing
legislation could have been amended without limiting Leave of Absence,
and that the new Bill would make matters worse. It fears community
orders will not have enough teeth.
Patients on Leave of Absence were subject to powers to insist on
treatment which were necessary in a small, but important, group of
patients who might lack insight into their illness, remained well on
medication, but relapsed on stopping it, posing a risk to themselves or
others.
''Psychiatric disability does not magically change at the end of one
year,'' said the commission's director, Dr James Dyer.
''There are currently more than a hundred people in Scotland who have
been on Leave of Absence for more than a year, and they are monitored by
us. Under the new proposals such people, who are currently able to get
on with their lives in the community, might be left at one extreme or
the other -- having to be kept in hospital, or left in the community
with inadequate powers to insist on treatment.''
The Scottish Division of the Royal College of Psychiatrists also
regrets the replacement of the current system. ''It offered arrangements
which were not possible in England and Wales,'' said honorary secretary
Dr Ian Pullen.
''Having said that, the proposed Bill is a reasonable attempt to
strike a balance between the needs of patients to receive care and
supervision when they lose insight into their illness, and their basic
human rights,'' he said.
''Some Scottish psychiatrists are concerned that there is not a
provision for treatment in the community -- only supervision -- but the
fact is it isn't really possible to treat someone by force in their own
home. If it comes down to that, they have to be taken back into
hospital.
''The Bill also means that if you want to continue supervision you
have to make out a case to a sheriff, so that you are having a review by
someone from the outside,'' he said.

SENIOR police officers in Scotland are under as much pressure as their
English counterparts to manipulate crime figures downwards, a leading
researcher for the Home Office claimed yesterday.
Professor John Benyon, director of the Centre for the Study of Public
Order, estimates that as many as 43% of reported crimes in England and
Wales are not now recorded.
He alleges that crimes are vanishing from official statistics because
of Whitehall's demands to reduce crime rates and meet performance
targets.
Mr Benyon, of Leicester University, said he had no doubts that
Scotland's eight police forces were now under similar pressure from the
Scottish Office to cut recorded crimes.
He added: ''The Government of law and order, which has presided over
the largest-ever crime rise, is in effect asking the forces of law and
order: 'Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?'
''The same danger must apply in Scotland, for obvious reasons. Police
must be under under pressure to improve crime statistics at a time when
there is talk of performance-related pay.''
Mr Benyon, whose Government researches include how different forces'
process cases, alleged ''a subtle manipulation'' of crime figures had
become prevalent in England and Wales over the past year.
He said Home Office figures for last year showed only 57% of nearly
eight million reported crimes were recorded, with at least 220,000 --
including burglaries, assaults, and car offences -- disappearing from
official statistics in 1993 because of changes to recording procedures.
Mr Benyon cited 10 separate offences -- including theft, criminal
damage, and malicious damage arising from a housebreaking -- being
reduced at a stroke to one recorded crime, breaking and entering.
His example is similar to that given by Grampian Chief Constable Ian
Oliver earlier this week. He said some Scottish forces might record five
car break-ins in a street as one crime while others might record all
five.
A spokesman for Mr Oliver yesterday denied any suggestion of massaged
figures in Scotland, and added: ''That would challenge the integrity of
officers.''
Mr Benyon insisted that political pressure ''to be seen to be doing
something about law and order'' was now a nationwide phenomenon, and
added: ''There is no doubt police are under pressure to reduce recorded
crimes and improve clear-up rates.''
His central allegation -- that recent falls in UK crime levels claimed
by the Government are due to police not recording offences as previously
-- follows criticisms by Opposition MPs about initial crime figures for
1994 released by the Scottish Office.
These show a fall in recorded crime of 3%, the third annual drop in a
row. Mr John McFall, Labour's Scottish Home Affairs spokesman, yesterday
declared the figures ''do not accurately depict the reality of the
situation''. He estimated only one-in-two crimes were reported, and
officers only record 38% of them.
He has trawled Government crime statistics since The Herald report on
Tuesday that violence, vandalism, and car offences are on the rise
despite the overall drop in crime.
The fall is due almost entirely to a 7% reduction in recorded crimes
of dishonesty, including housebreakings, shoplifting, and fraud.
Mr McFall said his research revealed ''a frightening picture'' about
Scottish crime rates. Between 1989 and 1993, robberies rose 26% and car
thefts 47%, and he declared: ''The Government is losing the battle
against drugs.''
Drugs offences have increased by 1056% since the Tories came to power:
1655 were recorded in 1979, but the figure for 1993, the latest
available, was 17,986. The problem was most acute in Lothian and
Borders, up 2184% during the same period.
The Home Office insisted it had not asked any police force to change
the way crimes were recorded, and added: ''There has been no pressure
from us to do so.''
The Scottish Office questioned how it could be accused of trying to
force crime rates down when increases in 1994 were reported in five out
of seven categories. A spokesman said of alleged political pressure to
massage figures: ''We would reject out of hand any suggestion of that
kind.''
The Scottish Police Federation, which represents officers to Chief
Inspector level, said it had no knowledge of figures being manipulated.
If it had, it would be ''saying something about it.''

FOOTBALLER Vinnie Jones last night looked certain to face action from
the Football Association over an alleged attack on a newspaper reporter
just hours after the mayhem of England's abandoned international match
in Dublin.
The Wales and Wimbledon defender, who arrived in Dublin on Tuesday
afternoon with a group of friends, is alleged to have bitten the nose of
a Daily Mirror news reporter, causing it to bleed.
Mr Mike Parry, FA press officer, who has already made a report of the
matter, said he saw an incident in a bar in Jury's Hotel a few hundred
yards from the city's Lansdowne Road ground.
''I did witness an incident between Vinnie Jones and Ted Oliver, a
reporter on the Mirror,'' said Mr Parry.
''I have compiled a report, which I have sent to my colleagues and
senior executives of the FA at Lancaster Gate.''
An association spokesman said reports of the incident would be
investigated.
Later, the Daily Mirror said in a statement that it had filed a
complaint to the Gardai in Dublin ''following an assault on its reporter
Ted Oliver by footballer Vinnie Jones''.
It said: ''The unprovoked attack against Mr Oliver occurred in a hotel
on Wednesday night while he was talking with an FA official, having just
arrived in Dublin to cover the night's disturbing events.''

<HEADLINE>Nitric acid discharged at Dounreay for 10 years</HEADLINE>

FOR the past 10 years radioactive nitric acid has been discharged into
the Pentland Firth by the operators of Dounreay, the Atomic Energy
Authority.
This is in direct contravention of the Control of Pollution Act which
carries a maximum penalty of a #20,000 fine and three months in prison.
The sole public mention of the discharges is a small extract which
appears in the 1993/94 annual report of the Highland River Purification
Board which has just been published.
This considers the plant's other failures to meet consents and then
continues: ''Of a more serious nature is the discovery that AEA is
disposing of large quantities of acid through their main radioactive
outfall. The authority has been advised that neutralisation of the
discharge is required in order to prevent a report being made to the
procurator-fiscal.''
The discharges are highly acidic and capable of dissolving any marine
lifeforms coming into contact with them before they are neutralised by
seawater.
Dounreay uses the acid to dissolve spent nuclear fuel rods containing
uranium and plutonium in its reprocessing complex and has been making
the discharges since reprocessing began over 35 years ago.
The practice only became illegal, however, in 1985 when the Control of
Pollution Act came into force.
This Act required the industry to apply for consents for discharges.
Whoever applied for consents on behalf of Dounreay made no mention of
acids. As a result the plant has been discharging it illegally every day
since.
Dounreay now seems to have only two courses: either to stop
reprocessing; or construct a multi-million pound plant to neutralise the
acid.
Mr Philip Wright, the purification board's divisional inspector in
Thurso, confirmed yesterday that the discarging had only come to the
board's attention in 1993. Discussions were now taking place between the
board, the AEA, and HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate.
''When application for consent was made there was no mention of acids
or nitrates, only of metals. If they had asked to discharge acids we
would have told them to neutralise them first.
''These discharges are highly acidic with a pH as low as one. You
don't get any lower. The seawater will eventually bring it up to seven,
neutralising it, but if a shellfish, for example, was to come into
contact with the discharge in its raw form, it would just dissolve in a
fizz and disappear.
''If this was in fresh river water it could cause an enormous amount
of damage to the environment. It is illegal and something will have to
be done to resolve it. The penalties are quite serious.''
Mr Wright thought the most likely course was that AEA would install a
neutralising plant but that could bring other problems. Other solids
would be produced, settlement tanks would be required, and then
facilities for the removal of the sludges and their disposal.
He said: ''It is an expensive operation.''
Mr Ian Shepherd, AEA's spokesman at Dounreay, told The Herald
yesterday he could not comment on why permission had not be sought for
the disposal of acid 10 years ago.
''What I can say is that we have been in discussion with the HRPB over
the acidity of our discharges for several years. During these
discussions the HRPB has been kept informed of the discharges and the
programme of action that is designed to produce a neutral discharge.''

Scottish Homes tenants could have their homes sold over their heads to
''predator'' companies, Labour claimed during a debate on the Finance
Bill in a Commons committee yesterday.
Mrs Helen Liddell, Labour MP for Monklands East, said: ''The scandal
of the sale of Scottish Homes houses opens the way to the exploitation
both of tenants and the public purse.''
Mr Andrew Smith, shadow Chief Secretary, said companies benefiting
from the sales could take advantage of new tax subsidies introduced by
the Bill. He said ''This could make peoples' homes the playthings of the
tax avoidance industry.''
Later, he said Treasury Minister Sir George Young had refused to rule
out the possibility of the subsidies going to property management or
maintenance companies, although he claimed that companies directly
receiving rents would not be able to take advantage of the schemes.

<RECORDNO>979812629</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS about British Gas have nearly doubled over the past year
and are now at record levels, a watchdog's report showed yesterday.
The Gas Consumers Council said that between last November and this
month its 12 regional offices dealt with nearly 10,960 complaints -- a
94% increase on the same period last year.
Last month there were 5246 complaints -- a 172% increase on January
1994.
That was the highest monthly figure since British Gas was privatised,
a GCC spokeswoman said. The previous record was 3670 in November 1988.
She said all complaints were ''substantial'' and merited
investigation.
British Gas said it was concerned about the figures but felt
complaints would soon start to fall again.
''This is a temporary reversal of a downward trend in customer
complaints, as we switch people and systems from the old world of
British Gas to the new structure which will be better able to cope with
the demands of business in the future,'' said executive director Norman
Blacker.
British Gas has recently been criticised for the 75% pay increase
given to its chief executive, Mr Cedric Brown.
It also came under fire for cutting showroom services, reducing
spending on safety checks, and shedding around 25,000 jobs.
During last month, GCC staff dealt with 13,737 queries from customers
who could not get an answer when they called British Gas -- an 83%
increase on January last year.
Earlier this year, the GCC said the Government should consider
withdrawing British Gas's Citizen's Charter mark because standards had
slipped so much.
Council officials said the rise in complaints came after British Gas
was reorganised in readiness for the opening up of the domestic gas
market.
Labour's consumer spokesman, Mr Nigel Griffiths, said Mr Brown should
meet Clare Spottiswoode, head of industry regulator, the Office of Gas
Supply, and look at ways of restoring services.
''These figures justify all the concerns Labour has raised in recent
months,'' he said. ''This situation must be addressed immediately.''

THOUSANDS of local government jobs could be lost if the Government
continues its present squeeze on council finances, Professor Arthur
Midwinter, a leading sociology academic, told a meeting of finance
officials in Glasgow yesterday.
He warned that councils would have to resort more and more to offering
early retirement and redundancy packages to help balance their books.
If there were more cash cutbacks next year, they could be forced to
shed more than the 1800 maximum number of staff forecast to go as a
result of reorganisation.
The professor also told the Scottish Audit Group that, as the move to
a single-tier structure got closer, the flaws in the original diagnosis
became clearer.
He said that reform was more likely to fragment specialist services in
areas such as education than to produce more coherent local government,
and that services by contract would be a poor substitute for direct
local authority provision.
The professor is Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at
Strathclyde University.

THE Government came under renewed pressure yesterday to prevent the

recent television documentary.
However, Trade and Industry Minister of State Earl Ferrers stressed
there were controls in place and accused the makers of the recent
Channel 4 Dispatches programme of having tried ''to entrap people into
saying things''.
The company concerned was the Glasgow firm ICL Plastics, based in
Maryhill. They were the subject of an investigation into the sale of
electro-shock batons.
The issue was raised in the Lords at question time by Labour's Lord
Dubs, the former MP Alf Dubs, who said the programme had found that leg
shackles and electric-shock weapons were being exported.
He quoted a businessman featured in the programme as saying his
company had sold electric-shock weapons ''with the Government's
blessing''.
Earl Ferrers insisted that export licences would not be granted for
leg shackles but he acknowledged it was impossible to control the
possible misuse of some exported goods in other countries. Five-amp
flex, bicycle chains, and cigarettes could all be used as weapons of
torture.
Condemning the Dispatches programme, the Minister said its makers had
gone to three companies to try to entrap them into saying they would be
prepared to make instruments of torture for export -- but all three had
refused.

A NEW ocean survey vessel for the Royal Navy is to be named after the
Antarctic explorer Captain Scott, Defence Procurement Minister Roger
Freeman announced yesterday. He told MPs: ''We recognise the importance
of specialist hydrographic vessels and personnel.
''We continue to plan for the upgrading of the capability of the
hydrographic service by procuring four new vessels, including a
new-build ocean survey vessel, an order for which was placed last
month.''
He added: ''We have decided to name the new OSV after the great
Antarctic explorer Scott and of course that vessel will do valuable work
for the hydrographic service.''

A MAN who murdered a pensioner for his bank cash card was jailed for
life at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday.
The court heard than John Docherty, 22, subjected his victim to
horrific violence to get him to divulge his PIN number.
Grandfather John Boyd, 69, was battered with a pair of pruning shears,
stabbed in the chest with a screwdriver, and had his throat knelt on as
he lay on the ground.
Despite his age the retired coal industry manager grappled with his
masked attacker in a fight for his life.
Within a few hours of killing Mr Boyd at his isolated cottage in
Waterside, near Patna, Ayrshire, Docherty was using his cash card to try
to get money from an auto teller in Ayr.
But he could not remember the PIN number given to him by his victim
and after three unsuccessful tries left without a penny.
Docherty, from a caravan site at Dalrymple, Ayrshire, admitted the
murder on October 21 last year.
Lord Kirkwood jailed him for life.
Earlier, Mr Colin Boyd, prosecuting, told how Mr Boyd's body was
discovered after his son could not get in touch with him and alerted
neighbours.
They found him in a kitchen/washhouse area lying on his back.
When Docherty was arrested six days later he at first denied being in
Patna at the time of the murder but eventually admitted the killing.
He told police that when the Mr Boyd ran towards him he stuck the
screwdriver in his ribs, and told him he wanted money.
Docherty said after he got Mr Boyd's cash card and asked him for the
number he did not remember very much except for attacking him with
shears.
Police found Mr Boyd's cash card in four pieces in a communal bin at
the caravan site where Docherty lived.
Yesterday Mr Boyd's son Allan, 36, sat in court with his wife Kathryn
to watch Docherty being jailed.
As he walked from court he said: ''The way my father died was
horrific. He must have been tortured for his bank card PIN number.''

SNP leader Alex Salmond yesterday accused John Major and Tony Blair of
scoring an own goal by using the term British instead of English when
referring to the football hooligans who forced the abandonment of the
friendly in Dublin.
In a letter to the Irish Taoiseach, Mr John Burton, Mr Major said the
actions of those who had caused the trouble did ''not reflect the true
face of Britain or of British football'' while Mr Blair had talked about
idiots who had brought ''shame on Britain and contempt on themselves''.
Mr Salmond said the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition
should apologise to the Scottish football authorities for their misuse
of the term British.
He said: ''Like all of Scotland I have the utmost sympathy with the
people of Dublin for the ordeal which they were forced to suffer at the
hands of a band of neo-Nazi thugs.
''And -- to paraphrase John Major -- while those thugs are in no way a
true reflection of the people of England or English sports fans, they
are certainly not representative of Scottish fans, or indeed the Welsh
or Northern Irish.''

<TEXT>
A BANK manager's wife told the High Court in Glasgow yesterday how
#11,000 in old notes were allegedly found in a wardrobe after her
father-in-law died.
Mrs Ann MacGillivray, 40, claimed she heard her husband gasp from
another room: ''Oh, Ann. Come here.''
She said: ''I thought he had found medals his master-baker father had
won for his black bun.''
However, she told the court it was ''more than #10,000'' in used
notes.
Her husband, Hector, 54, denies embezzling #163,000 of soiled notes
over 20 years at the Clydesdale Bank in Glasgow instead of incinerating
them.
Mrs MacGillivray claimed her husband found the money as they cleared
out his father's house in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute in l979.
She told Lord Prosser: ''I told him, 'Take this away from me'. I had
never seen so much money since I worked in the bank.
''He said there must have been at least #10,000 and I told him to deal
with it as it was a lot of money.
''We took it home to Bearsden and I thought he may have put in in a
building society.''
Mr MacGillivray has claimed he kept the money, #11,000, for 13 years
in the back of his own wardrobe before depositing various amounts in
society accounts from Glasgow to the Channel Isles.
Mrs MacGillivray, who met her husband in the bank after he divorced
his first wife, claimed her late father-in-law told her he would leave
money to her children. She claimed: ''He left it, but not in the normal
way.''
She also claimed she kept money left over from her weekly housekeeping
allowance from her husband's #11,000-a-year job in a bedroom drawer.
They both used this money, she claimed, for running expenses and her
husband rarely used a cash dispenser.
She said: ''If he needed cash for a weekly rail ticket to get to work
or for his bowling club, he took it from the drawer.''
Mrs MacGillivray said her husband ''loved his job'' until three years
ago when his health broke down under the strain of an extra work-load.
He became unhappy and she sometimes found him sitting crying.
After #43,000 vanished from the bank he was worried about the way
staff were being questioned, she said.
She added: ''Even some of the men were in tears. I told him not be be
bullied by them.''
Her husband ''shocked'' police with his sudden confession to stealing
up to #600 a week in old notes, the court heard.
However, Mrs MacGillivray claimed: ''He was mentally ill. He would
have confessed to being Jack the Ripper if they had asked him.''
She told the court he later felt he had ruined his family by making a
false confession, but she added: ''I told him we should fight it.''
Days after being charged with embezzlement and ordered out of the
bank, her husband returned home from a pub. She told the court: ''He
crawled under the dining room table and lay crying for his mummy and
said she would tell them he had not taken any money.''
A doctor was summoned and her husband was strapped into a chair by
ambulancemen and carried out of their bungalow.
He lost his memory and spent three months in a psychiatric ward of
Gartnavel Royal Hospital.
His first memory to return, she claimed, was of a fish-and-chip shop
at Bearsden.
She said: ''He did not know me and I took photographs of our wedding
and of our two sons. I know he never took any money from the bank.''
She said her husband sometimes travelled between Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Aberdeen, and the Royal Mint in London.
She told the court: ''He dealt with the Mint and he saved the bank
millions of pounds.''
Bank staff claimed Mr MacGillivray was seen pocketing money and that
notes marked for burning re-appeared back in circulation.
When they complained, they were told there was ''nothing sinister''
and to get on with their work.
When bundles of bank notes which had been weighed before burning
showed up short Mr MacGillivray ordered his staff to ignore it.
The trial continues.

<HEADLINE>Face cream withdrawn from sale after eye scare</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979812636</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TENS of thousands of pots of face cream were last night being taken
off shelves after an eye scare.
Sales of Oil of Ulay New Skin Discovery and Max Factor Active Response
Cream were suspended after dozens of women reported problems.
A few had suffered blurred vision, others complained that the creams
were making their eyes tingle and water, said maker Procter &amp; Gamble.
Around two million women use the creams, which were launched last
year, said the American soap and cosmetics giant.
A Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman said no-one had suffered ''serious or
lasting damage''.
She said the creams were safe if women did not use them near their
eyes. Sales were being suspended as a precaution.
Company scientists think the problem is being caused by the mixture of
chemicals in the creams. They are now looking at ways of changing the
formula.
Procter &amp; Gamble said the problem arose before Christmas and the firm
had attempted to solve it by sticking a label on pots, warning women not
to rub the cream near their eyes.
''We thought a warning label would prevent such problems, but it
hasn't,'' said Ceil Kuzma, vice president of research and development
for skincare products.
''So we're withdrawing these two products until we can invent milder
versions that can be used near the eyes.''
She added: ''We regret any discomfort these products may have caused
for any of our users.''
The spokeswoman would not say how much the withdrawal would cost P &amp;
G, although she said it would not be a huge amount because the creams
were ''niche'' products aimed at women ''over 30''.
P &amp; G said it was also withdrawing similar creams in the US and
Canada.
The creams are hydroxy acid-based products. Their main ingredient is
salicylic acid, which comes from willow bark.

<TEXT>
HEALTH officials in Grampian are looking for the source of an
animal-based infection which could be running through the public water
supply, and has so far affected 32 people.
The symptoms are severe vomiting and diarrhoea. One woman in her
thirties had to be taken to hospital yesterday with acute dehydration.
It is not known how many children are affected, although Moray
District Council's director of environmental health, Mr Gilbert
Robertson, has revealed that there are now 10 cases outside Elgin town
centre, where the bulk of sufferers live.
All victims live or work in the town, and environmental health
officials confirmed yesterday that the problem had been around for two
weeks. But Mr Robertson said: ''There is no cause for alarm.
''We have identified all the cases, and isolated one supply source.
All others have proved negative in testing.''
Mr Robertson admitted, however, that they did not know where the
bacteria ''crypto sporidium'' was coming from. ''It is from animal
faeces and very difficult to trace,'' he added.
The director said everything that could be done was being done by his
own authority, Grampian Health Board, and Grampian water services
department.
The bacteria has an incubation period of between 12-14 days.
He said tests were continuing, but admitted that there could be more
victims.
''We do not want to cause a public scare by advising people to boil
water before drinking. This kind of infection does not automatically
attack everyone. It depends upon the health of the individual and his or
her immune system. Admittedly though, children could be at greater
risk,'' Mr Robertson said.
Dr John Curnow, consultant in communicable diseases at Grampian Health
Board, said: ''Anyone suffering from prolonged sickness should contact
their GP.''

THREE prisoners were on the run last night after escaping from a
police van on the M80 on their way from court in Falkirk to Glasgow's
Barlinnie Prison.
Chief Inspector Mike Morrow, at Stenhousemuir, said the three men made
their escape at about 5pm near Bankhead interchange, Denny.
He said the three apparently burst open the rear door of the police
van in slow-moving rush-hour traffic after one prisoner slipped his
handcuffs.
Five other prisoners in the van made no moves to escape, and were
taken on to Barlinnie.
Mr Morrow said search teams were looking for the three, two of whom
might still be handcuffed together.
One man is described as 6ft 1in tall, with a skinhead haircut, light
brown hair, and wearing a maroon top under a black overtop, jeans and
black boots.
The second is 5ft 10in, with short dark hair and was wearing a blue
check shirt, black jumper and jeans.
The third is around 6ft, slim, with short black hair in a crewcut with
long sideboards. He was wearing a denim shirt, dark bomber jacket and
white trousers.

THANKS to a public address system chewing up speech like a demented
station Tannoy, the words spoken at Tuesday night's formal ScotRail
farewell to Sir Bob Reid were largely lost on me.
As the main hall in Kelvingrove Art Gallery echoed incoherently, I did
make out the departing British Rail chairman telling us that this had
been the best job, bar none, he had ever had. The words of the other
main speaker, ScotRail director Chris Green, had all meaning sucked from
them.
The man himself looked grey and seemed distracted. Even Sir Bob's
affectionate praise drew scarce a smile. No surprise, perhaps. Green's
at-times outspoken criticisms of rail privatisation, from someone who
has devoted his entire professional life to the industry, must have
placed him under intense personal pressure.
When he warned, in a Herald interview on January 12, of a rundown
Scottish railway if proposed budget cuts went through, he was ordered to
London by air the next day to face the music. Iain Wilson's article was,
I am told, minutely dissected, every direct quote examined to see just
how far over the mark Green might have stepped.
He emerged, apparently, on a last warning not to rock the boat. And
now he's going. Has he had a better offer? Or is this a professional
railwayman of impeccable credentials quitting because he can no longer
stomach the butchery of an industry he loves, for ideological ends?
He is turning his back, remember, on the opportunity to bid to lead a
sizeable Scottish business into the private sector. ScotRail operates
more than 95% of all rail services in Scotland, has a turnover of some
#300m (half of it from fares, half from grant support), and employs 4100
people.
It runs 1900 services a day, carrys 170,000 passengers daily, and
through its franchised on-train catering operation sells more than a
million cups of tea and coffee a year.
Green who, after his earlier period as general manager of ScotRail
between 1984 and 1986, went on to run Network SouthEast and InterCity,
could probably have had his pick of bigger plums on the rail
privatisation menu. He choose to come back north.
The plan to break the monolithic British Rail into nearly 100 pieces,
25 of them train operating companies, turns the likes of ScotRail into
businesses which need a much stronger customer focus. That attracted
Green. As he told a conference last November: ''The dynamics of this
relationship make railways one of the most complex and challenging
service providers to manage with excellence.''
That was precisely the kind of challenge which ignited the man.
ScotRail brought him back to a territory where, thanks to nearly 50 new
station openings in 10 years, much of it in collaboration with the
Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, rail was arguably enjoying
something of a renaissance.
But increasingly, as the implications of the 1993 Railways Act spilled
out, he could not hide his frustration. Rooms filled up with the new
legal contracts needed to govern relationships between the myriad
operating companies. As the lawyers grew fat on fee notes, Green and his
colleagues had to cope with the consequences.
His going leaves ScotRail rudderless. It also pokes an enormous hole
in the credibility of a policy which has few friends outwith Government
and its City advisers, including those lawyers piling contract upon
contract. If the privatisation timetable survives, Green's departure may
increase the likelihood of ScotRail going to a commercial bidder. But
even there enthusiasm is cooling.
Chris Green became a thorn in the side of successive Transport
Ministers. The current incumbent, Dr Mawhinney, seems a reasonable man.
He should reflect long and hard on a privatisation plan which prompts as
committed and professional a railman as Chris Green to quit the scene.

CHRIS Green's 10-year, on-off love affair with ScotRail is over. The
departure is bitter-sweet, coming after the five most torrid weeks of
his lifetime in the railways, both north and south of the Border.
The disenchantment was signalled in a recent exclusive interview in
The Herald about ScotRail's fate leading up to privatisation. It turned
out to be his swansong.
Mr Green's position as director was probably untenable after
extraordinary attacks on Government cost-cutting targets in the run-up
to privatisation.
He was summoned to London by the British Rail board to explain the
outburst in print which, in reality, was a calm but bleak assessment of
ScotRail's fate leading up to privatisation.
Mr Green was then told not to comment unless it would benefit the
railways and the sell-off process. That was never his way, which makes
his sudden departure all the more poignant -- and odd.
Perhaps he has realised that his promise to renew pride in the network
could not be met. Instead of expansion, he faced cuts of at least 5%
from April -- with more to follow.
The Government has ignored at its peril his warnings that a compromise
on financial support for the railways had to be reached. Mr Green
clearly wants no part of a future in which the money to keep ScotRail in
business at current levels is not forthcoming.
He wanted a future of expansion and quality services. His departure
suggests the rearguard action against cost-cutting targets has been
lost. It also suggests cuts loom on a scale not seen since Beeching --
and that his battles to preserve Scottish sleepers and Motorail are
doomed.
In the earlier interview, Mr Green said he was expected to get through
1995 with ''a near impossible target''.
He said the Government would get ''the cheapest railway, not the
best'', if the financial crisis were not relieved -- and if ScotRail had
to run services ''at minimum cost and without investment''.
However, his message on behalf of ScotRail, the preferred bidder for
the train operating franchise, went much further -- and probably sealed
his fate.
He said there was no escaping the harsh reality that ''a better
railway can be achieved only by higher levels of subsidy'', and went on:
''We have to make more savage cuts than anticipated. We are willing and
able to fund productivity, but not in a position to do so. That cannot
possibly sit with the policy of developing and expanding the railway.''
His statements were pored over by his London-based bosses, who face
pressure from the Government to talk up the privatisation process.
Mr Green, 52, the former general manager of ScotRail, returned north
in January last year to lead the network through the perils of
privatisation into a bright future of expansion.
But his support for privatisation has always been lukewarm.
That support turned to ice as the grim realities behind the break-up
of railways became clear.
He had little or no control, and the lack of power was hard for the
man who had launched Network SouthEast and headed InterCity.
Born in 1943, educated at Oxford, and a BR management trainee in 1965,
he has been a railway man all his life.
In 1980 he came to Scotland as chief operating manager, rising to be
general manager from 1984 to 1986.
His supporters look back on these years with ill-concealed nostalgia.
He pioneered customer innovations and took pleasure in using his
distance from headquarters in London to push through initiatives.
His enthusiasm for one of Scotland's largest businesses is undeniable.
But his frustration at running trains on a network over which he had no
control -- and no real hope of making a profit -- was also plain to see.

VISCOUNT Whitelaw -- a deputy Prime Minister under Mrs Thatcher -- has
joined the protests over the loss of Motorail and sleeper services.
He has written to the Rail Users Consultative Committee to complain at
the decision, announced in December, not to include Motorail and the
Fort William and Carlisle sleeper services in minimum requirements under
privatisation.
Lord Whitelaw was also said to be ''extremely angry'' after Transport
Minister John Watt cancelled a meeting with MPs and peers on the west
coast main line upgrade.
Yesterday a delegation of Liberal Democrat MPs met with the users
committee chairman, Major General Lennox Napier, to discuss the campaign
to save the services. He told them the committee had written to the Rail
Regulator, John Swift QC, demanding full consultation on the services.
Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, said: ''As and
when we secure consultation it will enable us to move on to the next
stage of the campaign -- preparing as powerful a case as possible for
retention and development of these services.''

SCOTRAIL has forced the newly elected Scottish official of the
locomen's union Aslef to resign from the industry, breaking railway
tradition and endangering relationships with the rail unions.
Traditionally, locomen who take up union office have been seconded to
the union and BR has guaranteed them a job and protected their seniority
should they want or need to return to rail work.
In practice few did, and most loco drivers who took up full-time union
office tended to stay with the union, although union posts have become
more precarious since Tory labour laws have demanded they submit
themselves for re-election every five years.
But with privatisation looming, ScotRail clearly does not see
guaranteeing jobs for union officials as a very attractive proposition
for prospective buyers, and has taken the opportunity of Mr Pat
O'Connor's elevation, from driver at Yoker depot to Scottish district
secretary, to break the traditional commitment.
ScotRail confirmed that Mr O'Connor, who this week succeeded retiring
Mr Willie Wilkie for an initial three-year term of office, was obliged
to sever his connections with the industry in line with a policy change
decided at BR board level last April, as part of the pre-privatisation
moves which reflect the ''new environment''.
Aslef, which has nine other full-time officials, including general
secretary Mr Lew Adams, fears this move will be followed by other shadow
franchises as Aslef officials on their ''books'' come up for
re-election.
The union is also worried that members might be discouraged from
taking up union office.
Officials of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union already quit their
rail jobs on assuming union office.

MR CHRIS Green has resigned as director of ScotRail, less than a year
after agreeing to lead the privatisation of the railways in Scotland.
His departure, effective at the end of the month, will be announced
today.
Rumours about it have been circulating for several weeks. Last month
Mr Green made clear his frustrations, as he warned that ScotRail faced
being run down because of Government demands for budget cuts.
His decision is a devastating blow for the Government, which had
counted on him to make privatisation north of the Border a success. The
news has also shocked his many supporters in the railways.
It is understood that Mr Green, who is on holiday, is leaving the
railway industry altogether to take up a post in England. The decision,
said to have been a difficult one, was taken for personal reasons.
ScotRail, however, neither confirmed nor denied that Mr Green is to
resign. A spokesman said last night: ''There seems to be a rumour
circulating that Chris Green will leave ScotRail at the end of the
month. If that is true it must be an absolutely marvellous job to induce
Mr Green away from an industry in which he has had such an outstanding
career for the last 30 years.''
News of his departure has stunned the Department of Transport. When Mr
Green was appointed to ScotRail in 1993, Ministers were at pains to
highlight ScotRail as one of privatisation's flagship franchises, which
would be the first to be sold off.
Last night the Government's disappointment was barely concealed. A
source said: ''If he is going to make any change, that is a matter for
him. If he has chosen to leave then good luck to him.''
When he took up the post in April last year Mr Green put in place a
high-powered team to prepare a management buy-out bid. As recently as
last week, with growing signs that the sell-off of ScotRail has
encountered severe difficulties, directors were still insisting that a
management bid would be submitted.
Last night Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's acting transport spokesman,
expressed shock at the loss of a ''man of integrity''. He said: ''This
is the ultimate indictement of the pure folly of what the Treasury are
doing to our railway network.
''Chris Green turned InterCity into a profitable and respected
business. Then he had to watch as the whole thing was dismembered for no
reason other than political spite.
''He is a man of integrity who is walking away from an industry he has
given his life to and which desperately needs people of his calibre in
its darkest hour.''
At 52 Mr Green, an Oxford graduate, is one of the railway's
high-fliers. After leaving Scotland as general manager of the Scottish
region in 1986, he was subsequently director of Network Southeast and
InterCity.
When the Government decided, against his wishes, to split up InterCity
prior to privatisation, Mr Green faced losing his job. His appointment
to head ScotRail was interpreted as a vote of confidence in ScotRail's
chances under privatisation.
But the optimism of eighteen months ago has been replaced with
confusion, amid evidence that the sale of ScotRail is going ''seriously
wrong''. The network was due to pass into private hands a year ago, but
the timetable, which few believe will be met, has since been put back,
with the earliest possible sale date in 1996.

A THUNDERING letter from Ulster Unionists to the Prime Minister
stalled a Cabinet decision on the future of Northern Ireland yesterday.
The next London/Dublin peace initiative is now being rethought, writes
Geoffrey Parkhouse.
The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, arranged for
another meeting with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring tomorrow to try
again to iron out the difficulties of a joint document designed to point
the way for negotiations between the Ulster Unionists, Sinn Fein, and
the SDLP.
The Unionists' letter warns the Cabinet of bleak consequences for this
initiative if there is any suggestion of cross-border joint authorities.
Signed by three of Mr Jim Molyneaux's colleagues, it also complains
that the Irish nationalists are being kept better informed by the
British Government than they are.
There was hope that London and Dublin could produce their joint
document next Wednesday, but after the Unionists' stance the Cabinet is
expected to need another discussion next Thursday.
The Irish Prime Minister, Mr John Bruton, in an attempt to calm the
situation, told the Senate in Dublin yesterday: ''The document should be
viewed as a facilitator to dialogue and not a political settlement in
itself.
''The final outcome of the dialogue will be put to referendum and the
principles of political agreement and popular consent will apply.''
He claimed that agreement on the document was very close.

<HEADLINE>Gays in push to lower age of consent to 16</HEADLINE>

A GAY rights' group, Stonewall, is planning a campaign to lower the
homosexual age of consent in Scotland to 16. It sees the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Bill as a perfect opportunity to try to change the
law, and is actively lobbying MPs for the change.
The move by Stonewall coincides almost exactly with the anniversary of
last year's change to the law, which saw the age of consent equalised at
18. Previously, Scotland had an age of consent of 18, while in the rest
of the country the age threshold was 21.
Stonewall's point is that if Scotland was out of line before, there is
no reason why it should not be so again, and that a move to 16 in
Scotland may force the Government to lower the age of consent in the
rest of the country.
The Scottish Criminal Justice Bill already has been through the Lords,
and comes to the Commons for its second reading on February 27. It will
go through second reading without any problems, but the moves on gay
rights are set to come to the fore when the Bill enters its committee
stage, probably early next month.
The gay rights' lobby still is trying to find a form of words which
will cover what it is seeking to do, and needs sympathetic MPs to argue
its corner.
A Stonewall spokesman said yesterday: ''We will be tabling an
amendment but we have not done it yet. Sixteen is fair and workable.
When you criminalise a small section of society they do not get the help
and support they need.''
The attempt to reduce the age of consent to 16 was defeated last year
by 307 votes to 280, a majority of 27, but the reduction to 18 went
through by a huge majority of 427 to 162, a majority of 265.
The vote was marked by furious demonstrations by gay rights' activists
outside the Commons, and a similar protest to mark the anniversary of
the occasion is planned for next week.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats are broadly sympathetic to the gay
activists' cause, but are taking a ''wait-and-see approach''. Labour's
spokesman, Dumbarton MP John McFall, said last night: ''Obviously we
will consider any representations made to us and try to formulate an
opinion. Given the different provisions that would exist in England and
Wales it could present certain problems, and it is important to achieve
the right balance.''
For the Liberal Democrats, the Roxburgh and Berwickshire MP, Mr Archy
Kirkwood, said: ''We would not discourage them, but we would have to
look at anything they came up with in that direction. We would be
willing to discuss this further with them, but let's wait and see.''
The Government took a hard line. A Scottish Office spokesman said:
''When the law was changed the last time it brought everyone into line,
but Ministers are not very keen on an amendment that separates us
again.''
While the last vote had been a free vote, it was made clear that this
may not be the case if the gay activists brought forward their proposals
under the current Bill.

THE Prime Minister claimed in the Commons yesterday he had
''reinforced'' Cabinet unity on Europe, after a 15-minute discussion in
which he told his colleagues to keep their doubts to themselves.
Mr Major told Ministers during yesterday's Cabinet meeting that if
they wanted to disagree with the policy he had set out they should do so
in the privacy of Cabinet committee meetings. In public comments they
should stick closely to settled policy -- and Ministers should not be
drawn into other speculative debate.
A series of Ministers then supported this view -- but some of them
made it clear that their doubts about a single currency and further
political union will not go away.
This was agreed as vital to avoiding further public embarrassments
over the clash of opinion among Cabinet Ministers over Britain's future
direction in Europe.
If a Cabinet Minister now breaks ranks after the Prime Minister's
stern move yesterday a resignation may have to be called for. Mr Major's
authority has been severely undermined by public squabbling.
Afterwards No 10 claimed that nobody demurred at the meeting and that
the Prime Minister had the fullest confidence in his Chancellor, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, and his other colleagues.
But profound divisions continue, particularly over the crucial issue
of whether a European single currency and central bank has serious
constitutional implications for the UK. The Chancellor said last week in
a public speech that it did not. He was immediately contradicted by
Welsh Secretary John Redwood who said that it did.
In the Commons the Labour leader, Mr Tony Blair, mocked the Prime
Minister: ''This is your Chancellor -- he has said in clear terms that a
single currency is not a threat to the nation state. Do you agree or
not?'' The Prime Minister dodged the question, pointing to divisions
within the Labour Party on this issue.
Tory back benchers are in a state of despair about the position which
many, on both sides of the argument about a single currency, believe is
being handled badly. The Prime Minister's ''gagging'' attempt yesterday
may be too late to repair his position.

AN inquiry is getting under way into how a small group of thugs
managed to wreck England's friendly football international against
Ireland.
Last night, politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea were demanding
to know how the ringleaders -- apparently right-wing extremists -- were
able to get tickets for Wednesday's match.
Despite universal condemnation of the scenes, which forced the Dutch
referee to abandon the game and led to dozens of arrests and injuries,
there was also widespread determination that the hooligans should not be
allowed to wreck England's plans to hold the 1996 European Championship
finals.
The Football Association received international support to remain as
host of the event, which is set to attract thousands of European fans to
the UK.
Prime Minister John Major and Mr Joao Havalange, president of
football's world governing body FIFA, united in backing the FA message
of no surrender to the troublemakers.
Nearly 30 English fans appeared before Dublin District Court yesterday
on charges connected with Wednesday's violence.
They all faced charges brought under Ireland's public order law,
including assault and breach of the peace.
Six were remanded in custody, the rest released and ordered to leave
the country.
The key question to be answered by the inquiry into the disturbances
at the Lansdowne Road stadium is: how did so many hooligans get tickets
in the first place?
Former Irish Cabinet Minister Bertie Ahern, leader of the Fianna Fail
opposition party, said it was ''clearly known'' that about 50 English
Nazi sympathisers were in the ground.
Mr Pat Smith, deputy chief executive of the English FA and the woman
in charge of ticketing, said the FA would examine whether there was a
failure in its own checks when distributing tickets to travelling fans.
Irish police admitted yesterday that they had received advance
intelligence about troublemakers attending the game.
But the Garda Siochana said the ''regrettable events'' had taken place
despite extensive preparatory work on their part.
The FA appealed for help from ''genuine'' fans to reveal the identity
of those responsible for the outrage.
MrDavid Davies, the FA's director of public affairs, said the FA was
heartened by the backing it received yesterday for continuing with plans
for next year's tournament.
''We've been in touch with UEFA (European football's governing body)
and FIFA and have been gratified by the widespread support for our view
that Euro '96 should and must go ahead.
''We understand the view of those who say the championships should not
go ahead, but who would have won then -- a tiny percentage of mindless
thugs, or more than a million genuine fans who want to have the
footballing experience of a lifetime?''
Although Mr Havalange backed England to retain the championships, UEFA
will not make a final decision until it has received reports from both
the FA and the Football Association of Ireland.
Mr Davies said: ''We are making a major effort to identify those at
the heart of the trouble. Many of them were recognisable from newspaper
photographs or television stills.''
The FA set up a freephone number, and Mr Davies said: ''We urge true
football supporters to ring 0800-515495 if they can help.
''We will be asking every club involved in the FA Cup fifth round to
repeat this appeal, and we trust the law will be used to its limits to
punish those involved last night.''
In the Commons yesterday, Mr Major condemned those involved in the
trouble.
