Hands of friendship: Dick McTaggart and Liz McColgan, two of Scotland
greatest sporting heroes, yesterday were rewarded with special T-shirts,
depicting the hands of great champions from around the Commonwealth.
Before last year's Games, former lightweight boxing champion McTaggart
-- now Scotland's director of coaching -- and double 10,000 metres
champion McColgan, sent outlines of their hands which were embroidered
into two Friendship Quilts, a tradition begun in Edinburgh in 1986. One
of the quilts is in Victoria, and the other in Kuala Lumpur where the
1998 Games will be held.

GREGG Hood, the Scotland under-21 player, is recovering in hospital
after a neck operation which will sideline him until September. But it
was not all bad news for the Ayr United man because he has been offered
a new full-time contract with the Somerset Park club.
''Gregg has had a problem with a displaced disc in his neck,'' said
Ayr manager Simon Stainrod, ''but we have been told that the successs
rate is very high.''
* TERRY Yorath, the former Wales manager, has signed an 18-month
contract to train the Lebanese national side.

PAUL Gascoigne's agent said yesterday that the Englishman is
interested in joining Rangers -- but that Walter Smith must wait.
Ibrox manager Smith has agreed a fee of around #4.5m with Italian
Serie A club Lazio for Gascoigne. But the player's agent, Len Lazarus,
says negotiations with the Scottish champions are on hold until talks
have taken place with Lazio.
Lazarus said: ''Paul has not yet agreed his situation with Lazio. We
need to talk to them first. Rangers may have agreed something with the
club but that is as far as it goes.
''We will talk to Lazio -- probably some time next week -- and then
Rangers and other clubs who are interested in signing Paul.''
Asked Gascoigne's initial feelings on possibly joining Rangers,
Lazarus said: ''He is certainly interested in Rangers -- but not to the
exclusion of everybody else. There are some clubs that would be excluded
almost immediately but Rangers are not one of them.
''Paul is happy for us to take it a stage further with them after
we've spoken to Lazio.''
Gascoigne, 28 later this month, has two years to run on his contract
with Lazio. But it already seems certain that his stay in Rome is over
with him out of favour with Lazio coach Zdenek Zeman, while chief
shareholder Sergio Cragnotti has offered him to British clubs.

A DOUBLE from Tony Yeboah in a 3-1 win helped Leeds take a stride
towards Europe and send outclassed Crystal Palace closer to the drop.
The Ghanaian has now scored 13 times since his #3.4m move from Eintracht
Frankfurt.
His goals sandwiched a close-range header from David Wetherall, while
Chris Armstrong found the target late on for the visitors.
Palace now need to win at Newcastle -- which would ensure Leeds of a
UEFA Cup spot -- and hope West Ham, Aston Villa or Sheffield Wednesday
slip up in their remaining games.
At Ipswich, Paul Rideout saved Everton from a last-day decider with
the only goal of the game in 50 minutes. Palace now annot catch them.
* PROBLEMS continue to mount for Dundee United, with under-21 player
Christian Dailly the latest to be hit by suspension as the Tannadice

<HEADLINE>Board recommends accepting #4.2m    Wool co-op faces takeover</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>20</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978468980</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A TAKEOVER bid being mounted by the British Wool Marketing Board's
wool handling and merchanting subsidiary will, if successful, give it
direct control of 70% of the country's #60m wool crop.
The #4.2m offer for Scottish English and Welsh Wool Growers Ltd, a
co-operative going back nearly 70 years, is on the basis of #4.10 for
each #1 of capital currently held by the co-op's 1400 members, most of
whom farm in Scotland and Wales.
Wool Growers (GB) Ltd claim the proposed acquisition should benefit
all 90,000 registered UK wool producers through greater efficiencies and
a reduction in the handling charge part of the board's total marketing
costs.
Despite the loss of its independent co-op status -- and the possible
disappearance of the name -- the board of SEWWG is recommending
acceptance by shareholders by June 14 at the latest.
The chairman, Jim Brown, from Biggar, Lanarkshire, said: ''The
approach took us by surprise, but we realised our priorities must be the
interests of shareholders, our 50 full-time employees, and wool
producers as a whole. Once we were satisfied on these counts, we were
able to recommend acceptance.''
If the deal for SEWWG -- which has a turnover of almost #3.5m -- goes
through, it will give Wool Growers (GB) 100% control of the ''A''
merchanting businesses in Scotland, including the three wool depots at
Hillington, Glasgow; Evanton, Ross-shire; and Galashiels in the Borders.
At present, the co-op handles about 9 million kilos of wool annually
under contract to the board. That represents 20% of the 47,000,000 kilos
produced in the UK and handled by 19 merchanting depots nationwide.
However, Mr Alun Evans, chairman of the BWMB and its subsidiary, Wool
Growers (GB), said there was no question of creating a monopoly. All UK
wool was sold by public auction, open to buyers from all over the world.
The proposed takeover would make no difference to producers in terms
of the board's obligation to try to market their wool at the lowest
possible cost.
''Our intention is to do the job more cheaply and efficiently than
anyone else, so making it very difficult for others to oppose us,'' he
added.
Welcoming the move, north of Scotland producer Mr George Murray, of
Rogart, Sutherland -- a member of SEWWG since 1956 -- said: ''I will
definitely be recommending acceptance of the offer, which I feel is in
the interests of wool producers, particularly those in remote areas.''
Turning to the Wool Board's newly- published price schedule for 1995,
which shows an average payment for wool of 120p a kg -- the highest in
the 45 years history of the board -- Mr Evans declared: ''The message
for producers is that they are better off sticking with the board.
''Although currently under review by the Government, I am confident we
will be allowed to continue as a statutory organisation. We have the
support of all the major buyers of wool, as well as the UK farmers'
unions.
''Wool is an industrial product which is totally subject to market
forces and doesn't come under the Common Agricultural Policy. It
operates in a world market, without any tariff barriers, which is ideal
in terms of the GATT agreement.''

LIFE is tough at Sidlaw at present with the packaging and oil services
company only partially in control of its own destiny because of the
escalation in raw material prices and the delays in recovering these
from customers.
In the most unpleasant half year in the company's history, there was a
swing from #6.85m profit into a #1.15m loss albeit that includes a book
loss on the disposal of the textile activities of #5.24m with the
on-going activities still turning in a fairly respectable #4.01m
surplus.
Market reaction was to slice 13p off the shares to 146p which compares
with the 275p of the 1993 rights issue and the 180p of last year's #23m
funding.
In the six months to March, the cost of packaging raw materials rose
#9.8m to almost #55m of which just #8m could be recovered from
customers. That coincided with competition in the market place and a
change in mix amounting to a revenue downturn of #7.3m which combined
with only a modest overall rise in volume resulted in packaging profits
falling #3m to #2.5m and operating margins from 6.6% to 3.4%.
Admittedly, the downward pressure was increased by Sidlaw at the same
time disrupting its UK production by moving 11 printing presses around
the country to provide a more efficient production layout to serve
specific customers. This affected UK volume by around 5%. That is part
of the programme to reduce costs by #3m annually by 1997.
Fortunately Sidlaw has an excellent portfolio of international clients
which are being serviced by the Transflex development system and which
promises to increase west European volume by 5% in the current half
year. But that is by pricing at market levels so margins will not show
that much of a recovery with profit advance to come from increasing
volume and market share.
After rising by 80% year on year, polymer prices appear to be
flattening and there will be some benefit from the UK efficiency
programme which has added 20% to capacity in the current half year.
Oil services presented a somewhat happier picture with a 10% rise to
#33.3m. Better efficiencies resulted in incentivisation payments from
the oil major customers which offset lower exploration activity and so
reduced quayside and vessel movements.
While profits this year could hit #10m (#14.7m) and recover much of
the lost ground in 1996, it is going to be a tough battle to see much
overall improvement in the share price with natural caps at the rights
issue level. The dividend has been effectively held at 4.5p and on the
basis of a maintained total, the yield would be over 9.1% which should
be sufficient to put a floor under the shares.

UNILEVER disappointed the City with its first quarter results showing
a rise of just 5% in pre-tax profits to #460m. Earnings per share rose
by 2% to 16.04p. Although overall sales and operating profit improved by
7%, there was a drop in European profitability. It fell by 19% to #239m
despite 7% higher turnover. Trading was notably difficult in Germany and
Italy.
The company continued to suffer from the after effects of its Persil
and OMO Power debacle where as well as getting rid of the dirt these
concentrated fabrics detergents also dissolved clothing after repeated
use. This was because the original formulation contained a problem which
was not detected before the launch. Although this was subsequently
rectified consumers remain, not surprisingly, reluctant to use the new
product.
While the performance of the European consumer businesses was
disappointing, there was a further increase in profits from the
speciality chemical operations. This reflected a recovery in demand and
prices. Higher edible oil prices and packaging costs also adversely
affected European profitability. However Unilever believes that European
margins can recover to recent levels and fairly quickly.
Unilever has a wide geographic spread which worked to its advantage in
the first quarter. In North America there was a significant increase in
profit compared with the corresponding period last year. Detergents
results improved and there continued to be good performances from
personal products such as Pond's skin care, speciality chemicals and ice
cream.
In the rest of the world sales and profits remained strong,
particularly in personal products and detergents. Demand in the emerging
markets of India and South Africa was notably strong.
Although it is one of the world's largest consumer products groups,
Unilever continues to add to its operations. So far this year, it has
completed or agreed 13 acquisitions and five disposals for a net
investment of #260m. The effect of acquisitions made in the quarter was
to boost turnover by #50m and operating profit by #3m. Last week,
Unilever agreed to pay Reckitt &amp; Colman #250m cash for its UK-based food
and drink business. It subsequently sold on the Robinsons soft drinks
business to Britannia Soft Drinks, a subsidiary of Bass.
Unilever's net debt at the end of March stood at #1800m, about #400m
below the level of March 1994. This was largely due to the strength of
sterling and Dutch guilder in relation to the predominantly
dollar-denominated debt. Gearing at the end of the period was #24m.
The dramatic slide in European profitability leading to profits at the
bottom end of analysts expectations coupled with the company's cautious
comments following an analysts meeting saw Unilever's shares drop 24p to
1212p.

SCOTTISH men's senior team manager Pat Nicol, who set his son, Peter,
on the road to a current standing of No.4 in the world, has been handed
an additional task of improving Scottish junior standards.
He replaces Egyptian Ahmed Safwat, whose failure to find a permanent
post in Scotland, and the heavy expense for the Scottish association of
bringing him north from Surrey, resulted in the ending of his contract
after just one year.
The juniors also are to have an exciting new programme, with regular
trips to England and the European circuit, which will be a boost for the
leading players.
''The new tournament schedule will replace many of the weekend squad
sessions, and I am sure it will greatly benefit the players,'' said
Nicol. ''Sometimes it becomes too easy when they are just playing
against each other in home tournaments.''
Drastic changes were called for following Scotland's disappointing
eleventh place in the World Junior Men's Championships in New Zealand
last summer, and the hope is that Lisa McKenna, Pam Nimmo, Laura
Hamilton, and Karen Emerson will produce better results at the Junior
Women's event in Sydney next month.

CAIRN Energy has signed a preliminary agreement with Midlands
Electricity to jointly develop an onshore gas field in Bangladesh and
operate an electricity power station fuelled by it.
The memorandum of understanding between Cairn, an independent oil and
gas group based in Edinburgh, and Midlands Power International (MPI) a
subsidiary of the English regional electricty firm, gives MPI a 30%
stake in Cairn's Semutang gas field in the Chittagong hills in eastern
Bangladesh.
The field forms part of Block 15, for which Cairn has negotiated a
production sharing agreement that is due to receive final approval from
the Bangladeshi authorities within two weeks.
Mr Tracy said Cairn and MPI would jointly evaluate Semutang over the
next nine months, carrying out a seismic survey and sinking between one
and three exploration wells.
If sufficient reserves are found, they will put the field into
production and negotiate with the Bangladeshi government the
construction of a 40 megawatt power station to absorb its production.
Mr Tracy said Cairn has an option to take a 30% stake in the power
station if the government allows MPI to build and operate it, but he
warned that Bangladesh had not yet spelt out clearly its position on the
privatisation of power supply.
If all goes well, gas production from the Semutang field could start
within 18 months, Mr Tracy said.
Cairn gained 100% control of block 15 when it purchased the Dutch gas
production and exploration company Holland Sea Search Holding (HSSH)
last month.

THE victim of a rugby assault expressed satisfaction last night after
an opponent who was found guilty of smashing his jaw was banned until
the end of the century.
Leith Accies hooker Ian Jeffery was taken to hospital after an
incident involving Billy Blyth. The Scottish Rugby Union yesterday found
the Murrayfield prop guilty of foul play and suspended him until the end
of the 1999-2000 season.
Jeffrey, 35, who is also club coach, said: ''The SRU have my full
backing. It was the most violent incident I have ever seen in senior
rugby.
''The punishment certainly fits the crime and it will go out as a
clear warning to any other player who has the thought of foul play in
their minds.''
Jeffery revealed that he still has trouble eating properly following
the injury, which was suffered in an off-the-ball flare-up. He said:
''My jaw was broken at the front and the side, and I needed an operation
to have two metal plates inserted. I also had to spend a few weeks
wearing a type of gumshield to help the bones knit together properly.''
He refused to say if he was considering legal action over the assault,
while ex-Boroughmuir man Blyth was not available for comment.
However, his Murrayfield club president Fred Ainslie was unhappy at
the length of the ban. He said: ''Our committee will discuss the issue
before we make any official statement. But I'm sure we will be lodging
an appeal.''

MIKE Evans, the man who stands between Frank Bruno and a fourth shot
at the world heavyweight boxing championship, flew into Glasgow from
America yesterday and announced: ''I'm no bum. I've never lay down to
any fighter, and I'm not about to do that against Frank Bruno.''
Evans, brought up in Chicago, but who now lives in Santa Ana,
California, with his five children, was only too well aware of the
feeling in certain quarters that he is just another body being brought
in to make Bruno look good, but he resents that and is determined to
make a fight of it when the pair meet at the Kelvin Hall on Saturday
night.
Bruno has been told that victory will clinch a shot at the World
Boxing Council title, held by Oliver McCall, but Evans' trainer, Craig
Johnson, said yesterday: ''Mike has a real chance against Bruno and he
knows that if he wins, he can step in to fight McCall or Bruce Seldon,
who recently won the World Boxing Association title.''
When it was pointed out that Bruno's last two opponents, Jesse
Ferguson and Rodolfo Marin, had lasted just three minutes and 27
seconds, Evans shook his head and said: ''It happens and it's a shame.
You find guys who travel just to fall over and take the money. It's bad
for the sport -- in fact it's a disgrace.
''Ferguson came to Britain not to get hurt. He didn't care about
winning and I can't understand that kind of attitude. If a guy does his
work and throws a lot of leather then gets stopped, that's okay, but not
to give of your best is cheating the public and that's wrong.''
Evans, who will go into the ring on Saturday carrying around 19
stones, has been stopped only once in a career spanning 41 contests, and
went the distance with former world champions Tony Tucker, Michael
Moorer, Tyrell Biggs, and Tony Tubbs. He makes no rash predictions about
Saturday's outcome, but says: ''I can hit and I'll be looking for the
openings. I'm not saying I will beat Bruno, but I know I can beat him.
''I've never avoided anybody -- you name him and I have either fought
him or worked him. That include's Mike Tyson and Tim Witherspoon, who
beat Bruno in his first challenge for a world title.
''I've watched Bruno over the last 10 years, and while he's no spring
chicken, he's a pretty good fighter. He's the type of opponent I like --
I thrive on a challenge. You've got to fight the best in this business.
Then you know where you stand.
''Now, this fight on Saturday is between two big, strong guys who can
punch. It could go any way. This is a gladiator sport and if I get
knocked out or stopped, then Bruno will have deserved to win -- but I'm
certainly not lying down for him. Would a singer or actor go out on
stage and deliberately perform below his best? I don't think so, and
that is my attitude to the work I do.''
Only Saturday night will tell if the amiable Evans is the real thing,
but having watched a video of him losing on points to Ray Anis, he looks
as if he can fight. ''I took the Anis fight at short notice, and there
were several things that were not right on the night,'' he said.
Evans, however, prefers to talk about his last outing, in March, when
he travelled to Brazil to fight the highly rated Adilson Rodriguez. He
said: ''Just like some people are saying here at the moment, the
Brazilians thought I was being brought in to provide Rodriguez with an
easy victory -- they thought I would lie down. Rodriguez now knows how
hard I can hit, for I knocked him out in the seventh. Could happen
again, you know.''
* BILLY Schwer will start to rebuild his world title credentials on
Friday against a man with a fledgling professional career -- and a vivid
imagination.
Zambian champion Steven Chungu, who bids for Schwer's Commonwealth
lightweight crown at Bethnal Green, has had only nine paid fights. But
he has claimed an amateur record of more than 200 bouts with just seven
defeats -- one of them in the Barcelona Olympics quarter-finals by Oscar
De La Hoya, who is now the IBF and WBO champion.
''I had him down twice,'' said Chungu, ''but they still gave him the
decision.''
In fact, the two never met, with Chungu losing in the second series at
featherweight to a boxer from the Dominican Republic and De La Hoya
taking the lightweight gold.
The American claimed the IBF title at the weekend with a second-round
win over Rafael Ruelas, who cut up Schwer in eight in Las Vegas in
January. Schwer, who has lost two of 28 contests, insists his ambitions
have not been dulled by that setback.
''It was a good experience for me,'' he said. ''I learned from it and
I feel I'll be a better fighter.''
* UNBEATEN Johnny Armour, the European and Commonwealth bantamweight
champion, meets Matthew Harris in a non-title bout at the Elephant and
Castle in London on May 19.
* BILLY Hardy, from Sunderland, managed by Tommy Gilmour, has been
nominated as the next official challenger for Frenchman Mehdi Labdouni's
European featherweight title.

IT was in 1984 that Benglass Ltd came into being. Richy Wilson already
had a background in double-glazing manufacturing and marketing and had
identified PVCu as the high-security and performance material of the
future.
He had been to Germany, where its benefits were already starting to be
appreciated, and had seen how this rigid and colour-fast material,
requiring only occasional cleaning with soapy water and offering
tremendous strength and security, was going to revolutionise a market
which was itself entering a high-growth period.
The company was originally established in a 2500sqft unit just off
Broad Street, but moved five years later to its present 4500sqft
premises at No 110.
Its workforce of six grew to 11 and it soon began supplying and
installing high-quality conservatories and porches in addition to its
other products.
It is now a company with a #700,000 turnover and clients all the UK,
but one which has retained the personal touch. It is highly regarded in
the trade and most of its work, says Richy Wilson, comes from referrals.
''Our aim,'' he says, ''is simple. To get it right, and to get it
right first time.''
The company's drive towards BS5750 accreditation has been greatly
helped by the East End Initiative, which arranged training by
consultants Ian Scott and Tom Hughes of Hawkes Enterprises, Hamilton.
The procedures necessary have been fully understood by the workforce
and Richy Wilson considers that his company, already efficient, has
benefited greatly from the process.
His main supplier, W H Smith &amp; Sons (Extrusions) Ltd of Birmingham, is
one of the leading names in the business and its System 10 products are
the result of a simply-stated company philosophy: zero defects.
''A lot of firms these days buy cheaply,'' says Wilson. ''We don't.
All our suppliers are accredited with BS5750 quality standards. We have
a reputation to maintain and we aim at high quality at a decent price.''
The Benglass factory has the latest in equipment and technology, with
a smooth operation that guarantees a quality job from start to finish.
''Anyone can come in and see the standard of our work,'' says Richy
Wilson.
Benglass also supplies a range of external cladding, and
maintenance-free external finishes to houses, and can offer a highly
attractive range of finishes for internal walls and ceilings. These are
on view at its Broad Street premises and the marbled-effect panels for
walls are particularly eye-catching.
''They are something different,'' says Richy Wilson. ''They have
already drawn favourable comments from people visiting the showroom and
I think we shall be seeing them grow in popularity.''

refreshing to come across a company which not only avoids the predatory
approach but also concentrates absolutely on quality.
Such claims are easy to make but Benglass Ltd of Glasgow is happy to
prove them.
It is in the final stages of the BS5750 accreditation process and this
will set the seal on the reputation it already enjoys in the trade.
For this is no fly-by-night concern, trumpeting special offers and
specialising in hard sell. It is one of the few in the Glasgow area
which have, as managing director Richy Wilson puts it, seen out their
10-year guarantees.
It is a family concern which has used the highest-specification
materials from the start, introduced computer design nine years ago, and
welcomes customers and potential customers to its East End showroom and
office with open arms.
''We are looking forward to getting BS5750/ISO9002 accreditation,''
says Mr Wilson. ''We hope this will happen in July and the process has
been in operation since early last September.
''The workforce has been closely involved at all stages and has
co-operated right down the line. We are emerging from this an even
better company than before, and it is our customers and potential
customers who will benefit.''
Those approaching Benglass will find that Wilson and his team are not
only highly knowledgeable about their trade but are also happy to
discuss what the visitor might have in mind, with a noticeable absence
of sales pressure.
Windows, doors, patio doors, porches and conservatories are all
available to any dimensions and in any style -- clear, leaded,
stained-glass, Georgian, etc. Finishes are available in mahogany, cherry
and walnut, or in conventional white.
All products are made of top-of-the-range System 10 PVCu double
glazing, which offer high performance in severe weather resistance.
Thermal conductivity windows have triple-chamber section frames,
reinforced with galvanised steel to ensure absence of expansion or
contraction and they and the doors feature high-security three-bolt
locking systems. Anti-jemmy features ensure that the glass cannot be
removed from outside.
The windows are of all types -- tilt-and-turn, casement, top swing,
and vertical sliders -- with high-security shoot-bolt locking
manufactured on the premises. Everything offered by Benglass is made
there: there are no off-the-shelf offers and no gimmicks.
''The workforce who originally started with us are still here,'' says
Richy Wilson. ''They and the staff who have since joined us are highly
skilled and motivated and our customers could not wish for a better team
to manufacture and install their orders.''
He and his co-director, wife Irene, have found increasing interest in
conservatories in recent years. Again, these can be computer designed to
fit requirements and to ensure that they blend in with the rest of the
building concerned.
Conservatories come in all sizes and shapes, from small lean-to
structures costing perhaps #3000 to large ones costing anything up to
#30,000. One of these, measuring 13m by 5m, was recently completed in
Pollokshields and Benglass has built a variety of conservatories up and
down the country, mainly for domestic customers but also for hotels.
The attraction here is that they are virtually extensions to one's
existing home, without undue expense or disruption. Benglass attends to
the entire job, from foundation to completion, and can take care of
planning permission, building warrants, and other local-authority
requirements.
Once the foundations and brickwork are in place, the conservatory
itself can be in place within a few days.
Installations carry a full 10-year insurance-backed guarantee and the
company's customers range from as far south as Birmingham to as far
north as Inverness.
Soon Richy Wilson will be casting his eyes even further afield when
all Benglass's products are featured in an exhibition at Johannesburg,
South Africa early next month.
This is the forerunner to the establishment of a new company over
there called ECO System 10 in which he will partner his brother Sandy,
who has been in South Africa for 28 years and now has a number of
companies specialising in construction and electrical work.
Benglass's doors, windows and conservatories have been specially
modified to suit the South African climate and have already been passed
by South African Bureau Standards and the new company will have a
manufacturing headquarters in Johannesburg with sub-offices in Durban
and Cape Town.
''South Africa is a wide-open market now that sanctions are a thing of
the past,'' says Wilson. ''The people there are very environmentally
conscious and we are adopting the slogan: Save A Tree -- Use PVC.
''There are so many beautiful houses there whose appearance is spoiled
by bars on windows, or steel frames. There is an emphasis on security
and our products are going to offer this, along with a great appearance
and environmental friendliness.''

CLYDEPORT is joining forces with the management and employees of
Dundee Port Authority to bid for the north-east trust port.
Yesterday's announcement of their alliance came on the day the port
authority advertised its successor company, Port of Dundee, for sale. It
is expected to fetch between #12m and #20m.
Meanwhile, Leith-based Forth Ports, which like Glasgow-based Clydeport
is listed on the Stock Exchange, is looking at the possibility of adding
Dundee to its existing east coast operations.
Forth Ports certainly has time to launch a rival bid, with indicative
offers to be submitted to Dundee Port Authority's financial advisor, BDO
Binder Hamlyn, by June 13.
A shortlist of bidders would then receive more detailed commercial
information, with completion envisaged in the early autumn.
Clydeport executive chairman John Mather said the combination of two
major ports on the west and east coasts was an extremely exciting and
powerful one, which would enhance their ability to attract both
transatlantic and European traffic.
Adding that Clydeport had been delighted to accept Dundee's invitation
to back its bid, Mr Mather added: ''The partnership between ourselves
and the management and employees of Dundee Port Authority will, if
successful in its bid, lead to the creation of a truly national ports
group in Scotland, offering tremendous advantages to both ports.''
Inquiries about the Clydeport-backed management and employee bid,
which will be made through Caledonian Ports, a new joint venture
company, were yesterday being referred to Robin Pilcher, a public
relations consultant acting for Caledonian.
The respective stakes of Clydeport and of the management and employees
of Dundee Port Authority in the new company were being kept under wraps.
Mr Pilcher, who stressed the importance of keeping such financial
details from rivals, said: ''To talk about the financial status of the
company at this time might compromise the whole bid situation.''
He added that the ultimate split in ownership between Clydeport and
Dundee management and employees, assuming the bid was successful, would
depend on the price which had to be paid.
Each of Dundee Port Authority's 95 employees is being invited to
subscribe conditionally for shares in Caledonian Ports, putting up money
only if the bid is successful.
Dundee Ports Authority chief executive Captain John Watson, who will
chair Caledonian, said Clydeport had been chosen because of the
complementary nature of its existing operations and the solid financial
base it would provide for the continued expansion of the port of Dundee.
The decision to privatise the trust port, by way of the competitive
tendering process outlined in the Ports Act 1991, was taken in November.
Captain Watson said: ''Dundee Port Authority has always agreed with
the principle of privatisation but waited until it felt the port was
ready for the move.''
Clydeport managing director, David Hunt, and Euan Davidson, director
and company secretary of the Glasgow-based ports operator, will be among
Caledonian's directors.
The port of Dundee, which made pre-tax profits of more than #800,000
on turnover of #5m last year, handles one million tonnes annually, split
equally between bulk and liquid cargoes.
As well as handling jute in manufactured form, the port is also
central to the transport of agricultural products, newsprint, wood pulp,
forestry, and oil.
A spokesman for Forth Ports said: ''Forth Ports will be finding out
more details of the sale before considering its course of action.
''It will certainly be investigating the matter further.''

THE wrangle between Celtic and Kilmarnock over compensation for the
management duo of Tommy Burns and Billy Stark will end a week on Monday
when the arbitration panel appointed to settle the dispute meets for the
final time. It is likely the Rugby Park club will be awarded substantial
damages, writes James Traynor.
Celtic's managing director Fergus McCann has always maintained his
innocence against the Scottish League ruling that Burns and Stark, who
were Kilmarnock's management team, were enticed away from Rugby Park
illegally, but Celtic still had to pay a #100,000 fine.
Now they are arguing against Kilmarnock's claim that they should also
have to pay compensation, and the Rugby Park side are seeking
approximately #350,000. The SFA directed the case towards a three-man
arbitration panel headed by Lord Ranald McLean and although Celtic
initially indicated they might be unwilling to be bound by the ruling
they eventually agreed to enter into the process. The panel were
supposed to meet last month, but one member could not make it and so the
serious business was delayed until Sunday and Monday. The panel and the
two groups at odds with one another met in the Westerwood Hotel in
Cumbernauld and they will reconvene there on May 22 when a final
decision will be made.
It is likely Celtic will be ordered to pay damages, but Kilmarnock are
unlikely to get the full amount they want, although the award could
still be substantial.
It is the SFA's intention to avoid the likelihood of anyone in the
future going against the panel's rulings or threatening to take cases
into the courts by amending article 180 of the official handbook to give
such panels automatic powers to assess and award damages and preclude
interested parties from going to a higher authority. The change will be
made at an extraordinary meeting of the SFA next Monday immediately
before the annual meeting.

THEY may be on a high after their 3-0 win against Rangers on Sunday,
but the Celtic players perhaps should be careful about making
presumptions about the cup final to come.
The assistant manager, Billy Stark, who has a deceptively quiet way of
putting forward his views, revealed management thinking when he
delivered a throwaway line as he discussed the team's prospects for
their penultimate premier-division game against Hibs this evening.
''Obviously the cup final has to be a motivating factor,'' he said,
''and the players should know that if they don't show the right appetite
they won't be involved in the final.''
In keeping with his style, Stark makes the remark sound like mundane
chit-chat, but it might be just the type the reminder of the Parkhead
players require to get their minds concentrated on matters in hand,
beginning at Easter Road tonight.
There has to be a real danger that the peak climbed on Sunday will
satisfy demands among players and fans until the next and far more
important test, against Airdrie in the Tennents Scottish Cup final on
May 27, yet Stark and manager Tommy Burns are well aware of the risks of
letting standards fall as they approach the grand finale.
''We have not been able to come off big games well this season,'' said
Stark. ''If you remember the semi-final of the Coca-Cola Cup against
Aberdeen which we won, we then lost our next game, and the same thing
happened after our win over Hibs in the Scottish Cup semi.''
Celtic lost to Rangers following their Coaca-Cola win and to Aberdeen
after their later cup success. ''This will be another test for them to
see if they can maintain the standard of Sunday.''
The side looks sure to be changed a little. Simon Donnelly, who had
his first start for months against Rangers, has a slight hamstring
problem which may keep him on the sidelines, while John Collins, who has
a chest infection, was sent home to bed yesterday and may not be feeling
100% today.
Collins, who has been in excellent form for much of the season, is the
subject of some speculation as to his future, not for the first time,
but Stark dismissed the suggestions that he would be heading for
Middlesbrough. ''We haven't heard anything from them and, anyway, John
has a year of his contract still to run,'' said Stark. ''The fact that
he is our top scorer and Scotland's, too, is bound to attract talk.''
Collins' agent, Raymond Sparkes, was equally unimpressed. ''You can't
prevent them from watching, but John would far rather concentrate on the
cup final against Airdrie and the remaining two league games.
''Middlesbrough are just the latest club to be linked with him.''
Whatever else happens to him, Hibs will be hoping that their former
player is absent tonight. Collins has scored in four of the five games
between the teams this season, and might just keep that record going.
Celtic will add players to the squad after the reactions to last
night's Reserve League Cup final at Pittodrie are assessed. Players like
Charlie Nicholas, Mark McNally, and Stuart Gray will have chances of
top-team consideration.
Andy Walker, who has an ankle injury, may be missing today and
Saturday. If Donnelly also is out that would allow Willie Falconer in to
stake a claim for that place alongside Pierre van Hooydonk.
Celtic intend to go away for a few days after the league season
finishes on Saturday to have a working break in advance of the final,
and then complete their preparations at Seamill.
Hibs, who will again be without Gordon Hunter and Darren Jackson,
suspended for the rest of the season, are likely to field the same team
as beat Hearts 3-1 at Easter Road. When they last played Celtic, they
lost in a cup semi-final replay, a game that Mickey Weir missed after
having been sent off in a reserve match.
''I couldn't even go to watch it,'' he said, ''I was so disappointed.
At least I get a chance to make up for it a bit.''
Weir and his team-mates are desperate to get the opportunity to play
in Europe next season, but they have to overtake Motherwell this week so
to do. Weir is not pessimistic about their chances: ''I still think we
can catch them but we have to make their last game meaningful by beating
Celtic, and then that would put pressure on their match with Hearts.''

Paris,
TONY Adams, the Arsenal captain, last night gave his caretaker-manager
Stewart Houston a double boost as the London side arrived here for their
European Cup-winners' Cup final against Real Zaragoza in the Parc des
Princes.
For Adams, whose future with the club has been shrouded in doubt and
speculation, declared that he wanted to finish his career at Highbury.
''Stewart Houston has done really well for this club in a difficult
situation,'' said Adams. ''Why should he not be given the job. Certainly
the players and myself would like him to be confirmed as the new
manager.''
Arsenal go into the game in the unexpected role of favourites to take
the trophy for the second year in succession -- and possibly become the
first team so to do.
Until now the Londoners have been underdogs in their two previous
major matches, against Auxerre, of France, and the Italians from
Sampdoria.
It was the same when they played the Italian Cup winners Parma in last
season's final.
Now, though, the continentals seem to realise that the British game as
typified by Adams and his team can still be a potent force in the major
tournaments.
Yesterday the Arsenal skipper said: ''There's no way that I want to
leave this club because there are still trophies to be won -- and we can
start winning them again this week. I have a contract until 1999 but I
have been offered a fresh deal to remain with the club. I know there was
a lot of talk about a possible move -- but I am Arsenal through and
through.
''I came here as a kid in 1983 when I could have chosen other teams,
including Manchester United. But I picked Arsenal then and I have no
regrets. I don't think I will have any regrets about staying here.
''I have been involved with the club in one of the most successful
periods in their history and I see no reason why the success run should
not continue.''
This has been a turbulent season for the London side. They have been
hit by scandal with Paul Merson admitting to drugs addiction, and George
Graham being fired as manager over allegations of illegal payments.
Somehow, though, they have marched on to reach this final, and Adams
points out: ''British grit, real British determination, has taken us
through and that is what will help us against the Spaniards.''
Houston, a Scot, has not named a team. He watched Zaragoza win 3-1 at
the weekend and maintains: ''They have some very dangerous players. They
are very attack-minded, more so than Sampdoria. People will say that we
are going to win, which is fine, but I don't see it as simply as that.
''There are too many quality players in their side to allow us to
relax.''
The Spaniards, too, seem confident that they may be able to pull off a
shock in a tournament where Arsenal have provided most of the surprises
this season.
The former Spurs midfielder, Nayim, says: ''We will win. We know the
strengths of Arsenal but we also know their weaknesses. We will be able
to find a way past their defenders even though we realise how
influential and important Tony Adams will be.''
Houston, of course, still waits to find out whether or not he will be
appointed manager on a permanent basis if he can push himself into the
history books by winning this cup.
The Arsenal board will not make a decision on the job until after the
team has made a short tour of China later this month. But they did say
yesterday that Houston's future will not be decided on this one game.
The man knows the pitfalls that favourites can experience. He played
in an English Cup final for Manchester United when they were odds-on to
win against Southampton.
They lost that day at Wembley and Houston still bears the scars.
''It's what happens on the day,'' he said, ''and that is what I will be
impressing on my players. Cup finals, whether domestic or European, are
only won if you can reach a performance peak for the one game.
''It doesn't matter now what we did against Auxerre or Sampdoria. We
simply have to do it again and do it our way. Zaragoza won't like
that.''

SPORTS fans here are trying to draw some conclusions from the recent
experience of 12-year-old Aaron Desmond, a baseball fan from
Minneapolis.
Like any child, big-name autographs are a possession to be prized.
With that in mind, Aaron sent out nice letters to 10 current and former
baseball stars asking for their autographs.
One letter was sent to Roy Campanella, a renowned catcher who has been
inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame. Unfortunately, and unbeknown to
Aaron, Campanella died in 1993.
None the less, from all the letters he sent out, Aaron received just
one response: a photograph of Campanella accompanied by a note of
explanation from his widow, Roxie.
* IN last week's NFL draft, the first pick of the Cincinnati Bengals
was a player by the name of Ki-Jana Carter. Some have suggested that,
given Carter's playing history, the Bengals are the only team for which
he could possibly play. Further examination reveals a distinct tendency
towards teams with feline related names.
Back in his home town of Westerville, Ohio, Carter played in a youth
league for the Westerville Bengals. After that, at Blendon Middle
School, his team were known as the Bobcats. Next came a spell with the
Westerville South High Wildcats, and then the Nittany Lions.
Ironically, the only reason the Cincinnati Bengals got a pick at
Carter was because he was passed over by the Carolina Panthers.
* THE Webb Institute of Naval Architecture is hardly a college
renowned for its sporting prowess. In fact, it is not renowned for much
of anything, particularly not basketball.
The team has not won a match in more than seven years. But basketball
coach, Richard Harris, is forever hopeful. When asked what he is looking
for in a player, he said: ''A 6ft 7in guy with a messiah complex.''
* USA Today was only trying to be helpful in a recent article
outlining tactics for securing tickets for next year's Olympic Games,
but sometimes the newspaper was just a little too caustic.
In addition to explaining how much tickets cost and how to go about
ordering them, other key questions were answered as follows.
Q. When will I know if I got the seats I wanted?
A. When you get your tickets next spring.
Q. What if the dog eats my tickets or I change my mind about going?
A. Tough, no refunds.
Q. How can I be assured of getting exactly the seats I want?
A. Be the chief of a sponsoring company that has paid $40m for the
privilege.
Q. Any other tips?
A. Chant your lucky mantra.
* OFTEN lost in the now resolved dispute between baseball's players
and team owners was the fact that the umpires also were on strike. And
when the players retook the field a few weeks back, it was largely
overlooked that the umpires still were involved in industrial action,
and that the ones in charge of the major league games were second-level
replacements.
Finally, though, the real referees are back on the job with a signed,
five-year contract that guarantees them salaries of between $100,000 and
$282,000 per year.
''We have a lot to be happy with and a lot to be unhappy with,''
commented Leonard Coleman, president of the National League, ''but we
are feeling celebratory.''
Jay Bell, a short-stop for the Pittsburg Pirates, observed: ''These
guys take so many years to get where they are. They are best of the
best.''
But Marty Springstead, the American League supervisor of umpires, was
philosophical. ''I think at first they will be appreciated, but before
long it will be 'kill the ump' all over again.''
* AS inevitable as another comeback was the fact that world
heavyweight boxing champion George Forman would write a book about his
long, colourful life in the ring.
Among the most intriguing sections is one in which Forman relates the
tale of his Rumble in the Jungle, his title clash with Muhammad Ali in
Zaire in 1974.
Forman has a litany of excuses for his losses, including, one, that
his water was drugged, two, that his manager dehydrated him, three, that
the referee gave a quick count, and four, that his manager gave him poor
instructions.
The manager in question, Dick Sadler, now is 80. He simply responded:
''Ali whupped his ass because of his stupidity.
''That's the one reason George forgot.''

DITCHED Scotland batsman Bruce Patterson last night confessed: ''I'd
love to play for my country again.''
The opener was left out of the national side after he failed to turn
up for a pre-season training session. Since then the Scots have slumped
to three humiliating defeats in the B&amp;H Cup.
Patterson insists it was all the result of a misunderstanding. He
said: ''I didn't turn up for one of the squad sessions after failing to
read a letter from the SCU properly.
''As a result I was training with my district side when I should have
been with the Scotland squad. I phoned the coach to explain when I
realised my error. But, I couldn't believe it when Jim Love questioned
my commitment.''
The selectors will name a squad today for the final B&amp;H game against
Northamptonshire, and the batsman with 51 caps gave them food for
thought with a knock of 91 in Strathclyde West's win over Central on
Sunday.
West's selection convener Jim Connell has demanded a re-think from SCU
chiefs, but Love would say only: ''There could be changes.''
That could mean a recall for Patterson's long-time opening partner,
Iain Philip, who may be asked to resolve Scotland's top-order batting
crisis. The  Stenhousemuir veteran also was in prime form as the
selectors scoured the country at the weekend.

A MAJOR international race on foot, by bike, and in canoe over 190
miles of scenic and historic Scottish countryside is to take place in
September.
The Scottish Coast to Coast will start at Ballachulish in the west and
finish at Aberdeen's Girdleness lighthouse on the shores of the North
Sea. Some of the world's finest multi-sports athletes will lead the
challenge, but all ages and abilities are being encouraged to compete.
The event was the dream of Robin Judkins, whose Coast to Coast has
attracted worldwide competitors to his native New Zealand for 13 years.
In 1993 he travelled to Scotland to plan the event and sought the help
of the Scottish Triathlon Association through the then secretary Jim
Stark, of Stonehaven.
Stark, general manager of an off-shore oilfield service company,
travelled to New Zealand in February to gain experience of the Speight's
Coast to Coast and this week he sent out the entry forms for the first
Scottish event.
''I have still not found a principal sponsor,'' he said, ''but thanks
to the support of various local authorities and enterprise companies, it
will definitely go ahead.''
About 250 competitors are expected to line up on the beach at
Ballachulish at 6.30am on Friday, September 8, for a three-mile run
before mounting their bikes on the outskirts of Glencoe Village. From
there it's a 96-mile cycle through Glencoe, across Rannoch Moor, through
Killin, along Loch Tay to Tummel Bridge, and finally Blair Castle, where
they camp overnight.
The next day starts with a gruelling 28-mile run up Glen Tilt and
through the mountains to the Linn of Dee and on to Braemar, where they
have been given permission to camp in the historic Highland Games arena.
The final day begins with a 36-mile cycle to Potarch, where they will
board kayaks for a 25-mile paddle down the River Dee before the final
stretch, a two-mile run to Girdleness.
Competitors can enter individually or in teams, with one participant
doing the run and cycle on day one, and the kayak and run on day three,
and the other doing the mountain run and the final day's cycle.
''Earlier this year, a veteran team of two with a combined age of 145
took part in the Speights Coast to Coast,'' explained Stark. ''There was
also a man running with his new false leg -- but with his old one
strapped over his back because he wasn't sure how good it would be!
''There is a Scottish canoeist with only one leg, whose wife runs and
cycles, and they plan to enter.
''Obviously, people have to be properly prepared because it is an
arduous event, but it really is open to everyone over 18.''
Considerable attention has been paid to safety and, before their entry
is accepted, competitors will have to provide evidence that they are
capable of paddling a grade 2 river by kayak. Coaches are available
through Stark.
Further details about the event are available from:
Jim Stark, Race Director, The Scottish Coast to Coast, 13 Riverside
Drive, Stonehaven, Kincardineshire AB3 2GP.

' In the very act of accepting the captaincy, Carling disenfranchised
himself from taking part in the perhaps justified public condemnation of
the people who had put him there. '
IT WOULD be easy to dismiss English rugby's Fartgate as just so much
hot air. The England rugby captain Will Carling still leads the
lilywhites to the World Cup in South Africa and RFU president Dennis
Easby -- the Old Fart in chief -- remains in office. God -- that great
referee in the sky -- is in his heaven and all, once again, is right
with the rugby world. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Will Carling is the most successful captain in the history of English
rugby. By the lights of his performance on Thursday night's Channel 4 TV
documentary in which he referred to the committee men who run English
rugby as ''57 old farts,'' he is also a prize prat.
And within hours of the programme being screened, the ''old farts'' --
or at least the six of them who took the decision to sack Carling -- had
proved that he was right in his verdict on their ability to manage a
multi-million-pound sporting enterprise.
The affair has implications for the worldwide game but let us examine
first the repercussions for rugby union in England. Carling was just 22
when he was named England's youngest-ever captain in 1988. Since then he
has led the English side to three Grand Slams and to a runner-up spot in
the 1991 World Cup. However, in the very act of accepting the captaincy,
Carling disenfranchised himself from taking part in the perhaps
justified public condemnation of the people who had put him there.
It is, of course, a nonsense that a game which has been transformed
from a recreation into a global business turning over millions of pounds
a year should be run by a handful of paid administrators and a 57-strong
committee of amateurs. But if Carling feels -- as he did, and presumably
still does -- that they are a bunch of old farts, then the honourable
thing to have done would have been to resign the captaincy with the
declaration that he was doing so because he could no longer work with,
or be the high-profile spokesman for, such a terminally moribund
organisation.
Despite the support of the 25 other members of the England RWC squad,
all of whom refused to entertain the notion that another captain could
be elevated from within their ranks, Carling is a major loser from this
affair. His entire life revolves around the fact that he is a sportsman
known the world over and that he is captain of the England rugby side.
He runs his own management training and personal development company
called Insight. In the aftermath of Fartgate one wonders how many
potential customers will have second thoughts about consulting him on
matters such as, in the jargon of the trade, inter-personal
communication skills and effective line-management.
In the Old Farts' camp, the outlook is no better. Dennis Easby and co
have been made to look, at best, foolish and, at worst, futile. Rule
No.1 of management decision-making is to determine whether or not the
chosen strategy can be made to work. They decided to sack Carling and
then found that they could not. There is no doubt that if a willing
captaincy candidate had emerged from the ranks of the England World Cup
squad, then Carling would have remained sacked.
And this is the issue which may, even yet, have repercussions for the
worldwide game. The players have flexed their muscles and they have won.
The balance of power has shifted and the players may decide that they
rather like their new-found status.
The administrators will argue that the players are merely ships that
pass in the night. The alickadoos, however, consider that they are the
true custodians of the game's ethos and that they will be around, if not
forever, then, by process of time-warp reincarnation, that their ideals
will be carried on by the next generation.
But it is the game's administrators -- not the players -- who have set
the agenda whereby it is now virtually impossible for an international
rugby player to serve the needs of his country, his employer, and his
family. It is Carling's Old Farts who have turned the elite players into
money-making machines for rugby unions and federations all over the
world. Need we wonder, then, that the players -- and this is at the
heart of Carling's criticism -- stop every now and again and wonder
whether or not they, too, should be in receipt of a slice of the
financial action.
Nevertheless, as England captain, Carling was wrong and naive to give
voice to these sentiments in the manner that he did.
In Scotland the game is run by a small core of paid administrators and
an 18-strong committee. The committee, as in England, represent the
clubs and the districts which are, to all intents and purposes, the
Scottish Rugby Union. There are those who believe that even an 18-strong
committee is too unwieldly to cope with the demands of a
multi-million-pound business and I understand that, currently, moves are
afoot to streamline the system.
There is an image of the committee as a bunch of blazer-bedecked
freeloaders who are in it for what they can get. However, these men give
freely of their time to serve the needs of the game in Scotland and if
the quid pro quo is that they get gratis trips abroad with the team,
then so be it. Nevertheless, if -- as many believe -- 18 is too many,
then compare this to the 57 who turn up when the England team is on
parade.
One will not be surprised when an announcement is made from
Murrayfield that the structure which has served the game for a century
and more is changing to meet the increasingly onerous demands of a game
which has changed more in the past decade than in the 172 years since
William Webb Ellis first ran with the ball on the playing fields of
Rugby School.
The relationship between players and officialdom has always been an
uneasy one. At a time when the game is moving inexorably towards full
professional status -- at least for the international elite -- that
relationship is becoming more tense than ever. The mental somersaults
which the administrators have to perform in order to justify the cash
which now goes the way of players -- no cash for playing but as much as
you like for off-the-park activities -- are painful to behold. It is a
nonsense and it is hypocritical.
Nevertheless, for those of us who love a game which has not yet been
tainted by commercial considerations, there is still a place for those
who are not blinded by the sight of the marketing men waving fistfuls of
pound notes on the touchline.
The challenge for those who run the sport is to steer a middle course
which meets the demands of the players but which, at the same time,
preserves the very thing which makes the game attractive to the
money-men in the first place. It would seem that, in England at least,
Carling's Old Farts are not up to that challenge.

LANCASHIRE smashed two records in a 77-run victory over
Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford to seal their place in next week's
Benson &amp; Hedges Cup quarter-final draw.
In yesterday's penultimate series of group matches, they slammed 353
for seven in their 55 overs, beating the previous competition-best total
in matches between two first-class counties.
After England captain Mike Atherton had been dismissed for nought,
Test prospects Jason Gallian (134) and John Crawley (114) produced a
Lancashire one-day record stand of 250 in 41 overs.
Graeme Archer led the Notts reply with a competition-best 74, but they
were held to 276 for seven.
Dominic Ostler defied a painful knee to keep alive Warwickshire's
chances of successfully defending their trophy. Ostler cruised to 52 off
55 balls before leaving gold award-winner Andy Moles (78) and Roger
Twose (62 not out) to beat Leicestershire's total of 224 for eight.
Graham Gooch's 69 was in vain as Essex crashed out of the competition
in a last-ball finish to Gloucestershire by two wickets at Chelmsford.
Jack Russell cut Darren Cousins' final delivery to the third-man
boundary to maintain Gloucestershire's 100% record in the competition.
Graeme Hick hit an unbeaten 127 off 124 balls -- his second century in
the Cup this season -- to lead Worcestershire to a 132-run win over
Derbyshire at New Road.
Wayne Larkins cracked a 105-ball century to set up a seven-run win for
Durham against Minor Counties. Minor Counties, who beat Leicestershire
in their previous match, reached 133 for one but Alan Walker's four for
42 haul proved decisive.
Combined Universities also were out of luck. They achieved the same
total as Hampshire at The Parks but the visitors took the spoils after
losing one fewer wicket.

ANNE Gibson will face British No.1 Julia Mann in the final of the
Friends Provident Grand Slam series at Gateshead on Saturday, following
her performance at last weekend's Lancaster Open, where she reached the
final only to be defeated by Kelly Morgan of Wales.
But the news was not all good for the Scottish team, scheduled to fly
out to Lausanne in Switzerland in a week's time for the World
Championships.
While Gibson was booking her place in the final, Scottish champion
Bruce Flockhart was withdrawing from the quarter-finals of the same
event with an Achilles injury.
However, after some physiotherapy, the 22-year-old Stirling University
scholarship student will be fit for Lausanne.
The International Badminton Federation have announced the draw for the
Sudirman Cup, the mixed team event at the World Championships. Following
the withdrawal of Malaysia from Scotland's group, they will instead face
the rapidly improving Chinese-Taipei in their first match.
''Scotland will have their work cut out,'' warned Anne Smillie, chief
executive of the Scottish Badminton Union.
A total of 50 countries -- an increase of 25% on the 1993 entry,
underlining the growing interest in badminton world-wide -- will take
part in the event, which Scotland will host in 1997.

FLEMING Far Eastern Investment Trust boosted its dividend to 1.6p per
share for the year to March 31 from 1.5p previously after a slight
increase in gross revenue from its equity investments in Asia.
Gross revenue rose to #12.4m from #11.8m and this boosted earnings per
share to 1.62p from 1.57p previously.
But the net asset value per share dipped to 342.1p from 394.0p at the
end of the 1994 financial year as Far Eastern markets tumbled.
The trust, managed by Fleming Investment Trust Management, had total
assets of #596m at the end of March of which 21% were invested in Japan,
18% in Malaysia, 16% in Thailand and 14% in Hong Kong.

SELKIRK-based printed circuit board manufacturer Exacta Circuits, the
subject of what was Scotland's largest management buyout back in 1986,
is being taken over by a quoted Staffordshire-based company half its
size.
Synergy was cited as the rationale for Exacta's #16m takeover by
Forward Group, which provides an exit route for venture capitalists who
financed the original buyout from STC.
With the initial consideration of #13.5m being satisfied by a mixture
of shares and cash, investors have the opportunity to remain with the
company, which will constitute the greatest part of the enlarged Forward
Group.
A further #2.5m in cash will be paid if Exacta's pre-tax profits for
1995 -- which the company said were looking very good -- exceed #5.5m.
Exacta, which has fully recovered from the blow dealt to it by the
recession a few years ago, made 1994 profits of #3.4m on turnover of
#44m.
Investment capital group 3i, which led the buyout nine years ago and
owns nearly one-quarter of the Borders company, yesterday said it would
continue to back Exacta managing director Derrick Bumpsteed and his
team.
3i, which will be one of the beneficiaries of a proposed #500,000
special dividend from Exacta, plans to roll over a large part of its
entitlement into shares.
More than #10m was raised for the Exacta buyout back in 1986, with
about #8.5m of this going into the pockets of STC.
Mr Bumpsteed will become chief executive of the enlarged Forward
Group. He will remain managing director of Exacta, which will operate as
a stand-alone subsidiary.
Although it secures large volumes of printed circuit boards from
overseas manufacturers for clients, underwriting their quality, Forward
Group's operations are focused on prototyping and low-volume work.
The Tamworth-based company is strong in the aerospace, instrumentation
and military markets.
Exacta, which is twice the size of Forward in turnover terms, is a
medium to large-volume business, heavily involved in mobile
telecommunications. Both companies are at the high technology end of the
market. They therefore fit well and no redundancies are expected among
Exacta's 820 employees at Selkirk and Galashiels. Savings are envisaged
through a range of group purchasing strategies.
Mr Bumpsteed said the alliance would make the enlarged group number
one or two in the UK and put it in the top five in Europe.
He added: ''We have been a buyout for nine years. It has always been
at the back of our minds that we had to find an exit route at some time.
''The two companies together are stronger than they are apart, both in
terms of financial strength and market position.''
Because of the size of the proposed transaction, shares in Forward
Group were suspended at 268p prior to yesterday's announcement, pending
full details.
Completion of the deal, which was lined up by Exacta's Edinburgh-based
advisor British Linen Bank, is anticipated in the second half of July.

THE pound has continued to pay the price for Kenneth Clarke's refusal
to raise interest rates on Friday. So far a massacre has been avoided,
but sterling still posted fresh lows against the Deutschmark and its
trade weighted index.
In the City the point was being made that credibility is built slowly,
but lost at a stroke. Two years of fiscal and monetary rectitude have
gone by the board as the Chancellor of the Exchequer chose to ignore
signals that the economy was continuing to grow at over 3% per annum,
above its trend rate of around 2.25%, and to turn a blind eye to the
pound's fall from grace this year.
The fear is that Clarke also rejected advice from the Governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George, in favour of raising interest rates.
Worse still it is suspected that Clarke was motivated by political
considerations in abandoning the sound financial stance that had
previously characterised his tenure of Number 11 Downing Street.
Minutes of Friday's meeting between the Chancellor and the Governor
will be published six weeks after the event, but the first big hurdle
will come tomorrow morning when the Bank of England releases its
quarterly inflation report.
This is expected to give the game away, no matter how delicate a
balancing act is performed by the economists and scribes of Threadneedle
Street.
Britain just passed its inflation test and no more in February after
increases in rates earlier that month and in December. The Bank forecast
that underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments,
two years ahead would be 2.5%, bang in the middle of its target range.
The Government is committed to inflation in the bottom half of the range
by the end of the current Parliament.
The fall in sterling has subsequently upset the applecart. Yesterday
the pound shed another 1.07 cents to $1.5876 and 1.36 pfennigs to
DM2.1797 after dropping below its previous record low of DM2.1790 to
DM2.1770. It also had to cope with a resurgence in the French franc
following Chirac's victory in the French presidential elections.
The trade weighted index closed an an all-time low of 82.7, down from
Friday's 83.6, itself just a touch above its previous low. As a result
sterling has lost 6.5% of its international value this year. This is
bound to have an adverse effect on the inflation outlook.
A lower exchange rate adds to inflationary pressures in two ways.
First and most obviously it increases import costs. Second
manufacturers' goods become more competitive in world markets. To the
extent that this boosts exports it aggravates constraints that may be
operating in the manufacturing sector to the detriment of factory gate
prices.
In the circumstances it is difficult to see how the Bank can avoid
concluding that the Government is in danger of missing its inflation
target. In an effort to avoid wreaking havoc on the foreign exchange
markets it may well make a feature of saying that the 4% upper limit of
the target range is not in danger yet.
In the City economists now fear that rates will peak at a higher level
than need have been the case because the Chancellor took cold feet on
Friday. In any event Clarke is likely to find that he has bought very
little time.
If the pound continues in the doldrums the pressure for higher rates
will be even greater when the two men meet again in June. The prospect
of an emergency hike in rates between now and then cannot be ruled out,
though it is difficult to see how Clarke's credibility could survive
such an outcome.

SPECIALIST engineering company Clyde Blowers showed a healthy #855,000
pre-tax profit in the six months to March, because of an exceptional
#1.4m gain from the sale of its former factory in Clydebank.
Profits from the sale to Wickes for a DIY store offset a #500,000
charge for the closure of Clyde Blowers' loss-making factory in Belgium
and the #423,000 cost of moving its Scottish factory to new premises in
Glasgow over the past month.
Clyde Blowers, which produces specialist equipment for cleaning
boilers and pneumatic conveying equipment, reported a #515,000 loss in
the first half of 1994, but turned this into a #521,000 pre-tax profit
for the year as a whole.
Company chairman and chief executive Jim McColl expressed
disappointment at the low level of sales in Western Europe during the
first half of this year. But he said the streamlining of operations in
Belgium should restore business there to profit.
''We have cut down to a level at which we can make a profit even with
the existing level of sales,'' Mr McColl said, noting that Clyde Blowers
took a first half loss of #600,000 on operations there.
''If Belgium had at least broken even we would had been looking at a
#1m plus profit in the first half of the year.''
Clyde Blowers announced last month that it was shutting down the
manufacture of boiler cleaning equipment in Belgium to concentrate
production at its new factory in Glasgow, where the firm's head office
is also located.
The company announced an interim dividend of 2.0p, up from 1.5p in
1994.

THE untimely death of Lord Morton of Shuna robbed the Scottish Bench
of one of its most formidable voices. But as Lord Coulsfield reminded
everyone in a beautifully-delivered tribute at the funeral service at St
Columba's Church in Blackhall, Edinburgh, the law took second place to
Lord Morton's first love -- his family. He had a particular soft spot
for his grandchildren.
Lord Coulsfield recalled the day that he and Hugh Morton set off for a
game of golf at Bruntsfield, but instead ended up buying a doll's house
in Kincardine.
Name game
* OVER the years, journalists covering the courts have been thankful
to the vivid imagination of the parents of the criminal classes for
endowing their offspring with such wonderful names. For example, Appollo
Backjones, Leroy Drumgoole and Ivor Novello Muirhead.
The latest in a distinguished line appeared on the list for the
Justiciary Appeal Court last week. Zoltan Varga Anderson obviously
sprang from the loins of a football fan besotted by the skills of the
legendary Hungarian footballer who graced the Scottish game during his
spell at Pittodrie in the early 70s.
Sometimes, of course, the clever names don't quite work. One advocate
recalled the case of a client whose first name was given as Gooey.
It was put to the client that this was an unusual name and he
explained that his mother had liked it when she came across it in a
book. ''How do you spell it?'' queried the lawyer. ''G-U-Y'', was the
reply.
No publicity
* ON a more serious note, the way we announce the appointment of new
judges and law officers who are, after all, supposed to be performing
some of the most important jobs in the country, can only be described as
dismal.
The manner in which they carry out their jobs can have a tremendous
impact -- for good or ill -- on people's lives.
Yet the public is given the absolute minimum of information on who
these people are, and their qualifications for the job. Last week, for
example, all that was provided for the media on appointment of a
Solicitor General for Scotland was a note saying that the new man, Mr
Donald Mackay QC, would be available for a picture. No age, no career or
family details. Nothing. As far as the outside world world was
concerned, Mr Mackay might just have dropped in from the planet Zanussi.
This is one area where we could learn a valuable lesson from the
American system which, despite all its faults, provides a detailed and
open scrutiny of senior legal appointments.
To be fair, the minimalist way these posts are announced does match
the obscurity of the methods by which the incumbents are appointed.
Pedal power
* EXPECTATION is rising over the epic Land's End to John o'Groats bike
ride by the Fife Forensic Flyer, Sheriff Charles Palmer, in aid of the
British Heart Foundation, which actor Tony Roper is launching at
Dunfermline on Friday. Meanwhile, his lordship has been in training on
the bike and shifting the contents of a flat: ''I reckon I'm in good
shape. I was 16 times up and down two flights of stairs, and that's
about 500ft.''
Pulpit Prais
* WHAT does Mr Edgar Prais have against the Church of Scotland? We
pose the question following a recent jury speech by the esteemed QC, a
former winner of the diary's most colourful jumper of the vacation
(sorry, recess) award. Mr Prais apologised to the ladies and gentleman
jurors thus: ''I'm sorry if I appear to be haranguing you. I don't want
to appear to be sermonising like a Church of Scotland minister.''
With all due respect to the clergy, jury speeches by Mr Prais are, on
the whole, rather more entertaining than the average sermon.

Robert Dickson warns that unless an effort is made to simplify issues
for jurors the legal system may be unable to cope with certain complex
cases.
THE recent decision by Judge Thomas Crowther to stop a criminal trial
because it had become ''oppressive and unmanageable'' for the jury
raises the question of how far it is appropriate to leave major
decisions affecting liberty and reputation in the hands of 12 or 15 lay
people.
The trial at Newport, Gwent, which concerned allegations of fraud on a
building society, had already run for six months when the defence lawyer
successfully pled with the judge to terminate proceedings.
The case was undoubtedly a complex one with a mass of figures, bank
transfers, and legal documents for the jury to consider. A series of
computer screens had been installed in the court to assist. It was
however alleged that while counsel were quoting from the volumes of
productions (said to be capable of creating a pile 40ft in height), two
jury members were indulging in a game of noughts and crosses!
Trials nowadays seem to take longer and longer and there is a
corresponding increase in pressure on jurors. When in 1958 Peter Manuel
was convicted at Glasgow High Court of seven murders the trial, which
lasted for three weeks, was one of the longest ever in Scotland. Major
cases often took no longer than two days and a sheriff and jury trial
which continued overnight was a comparative rarity. Even in England
where the need for opening speeches lengthen proceedings considerably
the extent of ''a long jury trial'' was measured in days and not months.
When in 1922 Horatio Bottomley was convicted of fraud and the
embezzlement of the then considerable sum of #150,000, his trial at the
Old Bailey lasted for only 10 days. The details required to convict him
were considerable as he had swindled thousands of people who had each
contributed sums of money to his Victory Bond Club.
He had promised subscribers an opportunity to partake in what would
have been a premium-bond type venture with prizes and a guaranteed right
to repayment of any sums invested. Instead, in the course of 10 months
he frittered the money away in lavish spending, gambling, and excessive
drinking.
As many of those who had lost money were small investors, the task
facing the prosecution was an immense one. There was a real danger that
amid the mass of details and documents that the central point of the
case, namely that Bottomley had received money which had disappeared,
would be lost.
The problem was overcome by the skill of the prosecuting counsel, Mr
Travers Humphreys, who reduced the figures and issues to comprehensible
proportions. A qualified chartered accountant, he realised that while
he, with his professional training, might understand what had happened,
it was his duty to ensure that he unravelled the tangle so that
everybody else followed it as well. Every time Bottomley (who defended
himself) tried to cloud the issue with irrelevances the prosecuting
counsel brought the jury's attention back to the facts of the case.
So clearly and simply had the prosecution been laid out that the 10
men and two women of the jury only took 28 minutes to convict the
Liberal MP for South Hackney. After he was sentenced to seven years'
penal servitude the House of Commons voted to expel one of its most
extraordinary and colourful Members.
On his release from prison Bottomley tried to make a comeback into
public life by returning to his original occupation as a journalist and
newspaper owner. His reputation and the memory of the many who had lost
their savings by being duped by him ensured that he was never able to
resume his lifestyle of champagne and luxury. In 1933 he died in
poverty.
Travers Humphreys became one of England's leading judges remaining on
the Bench for 23 years before retiring in 1954 at the age of 84. His
ability to make even the most complicated case comprehensible for any
jury was one of his greatest qualities.
The Bottomley case illustrates how a complicated swindle could be
dealt with before a lay jury. The speed with which it was concluded may
be due partly to the determinaton of the judge, Mr Justice Salter, and
of prosecutor to ensure that the jury were neither deceived nor
hoodwinked. Nowadays, at least in America, there appears to be a need
for a similar determined approach. Two of O J Simpson's attorneys have
already been fined by the presiding judge for making a statement ''with
reckless disregard for the truth if not a deliberate attempt to
mislead''; their conduct is said to have protracted the trial by four
days.
Unless the example shown by the Bottomley case is followed by modern
lawyers there remains a very real danger that the legal system both in
Scotland and in England may be unable to cope with certain cases.
Jurors may become so bored by the length and complexities of a case
that they fail to follow proceedings. By doing so they would be
emulating Barnie, a 12-year-old springer spaniel who attends court daily
with his master -- a judge at Colchester County Court.
Last month, however, the dog's snores so disrupted the hearing that
one defendant is now claiming a retrial. Unless an effort is made to
ensure that irrelevance is eliminated and issues simplified to a
comprehensible level then it cannot be long before a juror follows the
canine example.

RECOVERY in chemicals is continuing to drive BP's profits forward at a
hot pace, with the first quarter showing a 41% rise in net income to
#464m on a replacement cost basis which takes out the effect of stock
movements.
A quarterly dividend of 3p is declared. This is the same as for the
previous quarter but is 20% above the corresponding quarter last year.
Shareholders electing to take new shares instead will receive the
equivalent of 25% more than the cash payout.
Also helping the results was an upturn in the oil price which averaged
20% more than a year earlier at $16.72 a barrel. It has since
strengthened further and currently stands at $19. The upturn reflects
the recent ban on US imports from Iran, increased buying from European
refiners and an improvememt in the US gasoline market. BP says that
prices are likely to remain exposed to short-term volatility.
Higher crude values have lifted exploration and production's
contribution by 44% to #543m. Further efficiency inprovements also came
through and there were lower exploration write-offs. BP is aiming to
increase its average hydrocarbon production by 2% a year from the 1993
base, spearheaded by gas which it expects to rise by 6%. Last year saw a
3% increase in hydrocarbon output but 1995 looks like being flatter.
In the opening quarter oil production was maintained with new fields
offsetting declines in more mature ones. In 1995 new oil production will
be limited to the Cusiana Field in Colombia, Pedernales in Venezuela and
start-up in Wanaea and Cossack in Australia. Next year should see
stronger growth with the Harding, Foinaven and Andrew Fields in the UK
and Mars in the Gulf of Mexico coming on stream. Gas output was down
because the mild winter reduced British Gas offtake while the market
became more competitive.
Chemicals' dramatic recovery continued apace with the first quarter
operating profits of #244m double the 1994 final quarter and almost 10
times the comparable period. Better margins are the main driving force,
reflecting inproved demand which has raised plant loadings on a reduced
cost base. The uptrend could have some way to go as prices and margins
are still below the peak levels seen in the last cycle.
''The cycle in continental Europe will not peak until later this year,
if then,'' said chief executive David Simon.
Higher crude prices work against refining and marketing by increasing
feedstock costs and profits collapsed from #214m to #43m, despite
continuing cost reductions. Refining margins dropped 58% to their lower
level in 10 years as a result of excess industry capacity and a mild
winter. In addition uncertainty about the level of participation in the
US reformulated gasoline programme which is designed to reduce
emissions, put downward pressure on refining margins. Marketing margins
were also lower.
However BP sees the division's depressed margins to be temporary. Mr
Simon commented: ''In the last six months of the year we will probably
see reasonable margins again.''
Mr Simon confirmed that the group was on track to achieve its goals of
earnings of $3000m by 1996, capital spending of $4000m-$4500m in 1995
and a reduction in debt from $10bn now to $8000m.
BP shares gained 8[1/2]p to 464p on the figures which prompted some
analysts to raise their full year estimates. Jurjen Lunshof of Credit
Lyonnais Laing lifted his from #1900m to #2000m and indicated he would
remain ''an aggressive buyer'' of the shares, which yield a prospective
3.2%.

LITTLE more than a month ago Hearts were cruising in the top half of
the premier division. Tommy McLean was voted manager of the month, his
team were within reach of a European place and were preparing for a
Scottish Cup semi-final. Life above the scramble for survival was sweet
and the club were probably already looking ahead to a bright future.
However, the fates were gathering and conspiring against the
Tynecastle club who are approaching the final day of the league season
with trepidation.
McLean will be working frantically trying to reinforce belief within
his camp, but a dark cloud hangs over Gorgie. The harsh reality is that
Hearts are a team in a decline and there must be doubts about their
ability to cling on to premier division status. They are perched over
the trapdoor to the place below and Motherwell will travel to Edinburgh
on Saturday like executioners prepared to pull on the lever.
That it should be Motherwell who may inflict lasting damage carries an
irony which has not been lost on McLean, who chose to leave the Fir Park
club at the end of last season to continue his career with Hearts. He
would be a peculiar man indeed if, in his quieter moments between now
and Saturday, he doesn't once doubt his judgment, but publicly he
remains adamant he made the correct decision.
''My time with Motherwell was finished,'' he said yesterday, ''and
when you make your decision to move on that's exactly what you should do
and not look back.
''I know people will want to make something out of the ironic position
in which I now find myself, but I have no regrets. I am Hearts' manager
and you have to remember whether or not we remain in the premier
division is entirely up to us.''
The position is clear so far as Hearts are concerned even though
Aberdeen, whose 2-1 defeat of Dundee United last Saturday carried them
two points above the Tannadice side, have been demonstrating that if
they are to leave the top flight they won't go quietly or without a
fight. The rediscovery of their zest for life has taken them to within
two points of Hearts and their final game of the season is at
Brockville, where they just might find that mentally Falkirk have
already gone on holiday.
Depending on the outcome of tonight's game between Hibernian and
Celtic at Easter Road, Motherwell might still have some playing to do to
secure their European place. If they should require a point at
Tynecastle, Hearts' task would become even tougher, although McLean
accentuated the positive.
''It is straightforward,'' he said. ''If we win it doesn't matter what
Aberdeen do because we will be safe. My players have got to approach
this match determined to settle for nothing less than a draw.''
It is the manager's belief that Hearts wouldn't be in such a perilous
situation had they not been hit by injuries to key players like Stephen
Frail, whose running power and attacking play from deep positions is
vital to Hearts, John Robertson, Kevin Thomas, and John Millar, who are
goalscorers.
''It disturbs me when I hear it said we have fallen apart because the
reason we are not performing the way we were up until just more than a
month ago is we have lost key players,'' McLean said. ''No-one can
legislate for injuries, but I still had players who should have provided
more positive results. Perhaps in a more ideal world I would have been
able to have done something to ease the problems we face now.''
By that he means he would have made signings for the club, but he
might have little opportunity to do that should Hearts fail to escape
relegation via a play-off with either Raith Rovers, Dunfermline, or
Dundee, who are disputing the first division title and the play-off
spot. If Hearts drop a division, McLean would find it even harder to
entice money from his directors.
Perhaps they would have felt more confident about providing finances
if the side had been able to maintain the form which saw them as serious
contenders as recently as March. ''Then I don't think anyone would have
said we would be in danger of relegation, but you never say never in
football,'' McLean added.
''In April we were above Falkirk, Kilmarnock, Partick Thistle, and
Aberdeen and the players were put on increased bonuses to avoid what is
happening to them now. Football does that to you sometimes. Everything
looks good one minute and the next it all changes and you find yourself
on a downward trend.
''Now it comes down to one final game, although I wouldn't say
Motherwell would be responsible for putting us in trouble if we lose.
This has happened over 36 matches and not one.''

YOU know the month of bank holidays is well and truly upon us when the
local supermarket finally stops trying to shift its stockpiled
sculptures of mince pies and instead packs the space with barbecue
paraphernalia.
It's a safe bet that, despite all the publicity, few spam fritters
will have been consumed during the recent VE commemoration festivities
but doubtless a number of mixed-grill packs will have been munched. This
May rash of Monday holidays kickstarts an annual burst of spontaneous
(sloshed) Sunday night invitations to barbecue parties, which in the
pantheon of suburban farces easily triumph over the nearest contender,
the car-boot sale.
The barbecue party is much worse, the most heinous cultural invasion
since Skol sandals. The image of the family or friends laughing around
the barbecue is a staple of American films and Australian soap operas
and, dopes that we are, we've bought it wholesale.
We paid scant regard to climactic differentials or genetic limitations
-- because, let's face it, Brad from Neighbours might be able to rustle
up a barbie in less time than it takes to say ''make mine a Castlemaine
XXXX'' -- but the average Brit simply doesn't have the necessary
barbecue chromosome. We've never quite got to grips with it. We're
talking major fiasco here. We're talking the whole street's laundry
reeking of burnt steak here.
However, even as I write, and despite the omnipresent threat of spring
showers, barbecue sets are being dragged out of the garage or shed,
cleaned up and put into action.
And parallel to this a strange metamorphosis is taking place, as
mild-mannered urbane chaps turn into barbie butches. Men . . . okay, as
a grudging concession to the spiteful accusations of sexism which are
dogging this column I'll hold fire on such sweeping generic statements .
. . most men are not turned on by tagliatelle, they are not switched on
to salads, but when it comes to barbecues their eyes light up, they
slide off the sofa and, get this, even offer to do the shopping.
Picnics are for prats but barbecues are manly; everything about them
is butch, it's all big bags of briquettes and bumper bags of bangers.
The kind of man who normally regards the threshold of the kitchen as the
gateway to hell and everlasting damnation, who is confused by the
cooker, and mystified by the microwave, is suddenly seized by the
conviction that he is Marco Pierre White. Well, make that a cross
between Marco and Crocodile Dundee.
A cluster of guys will instantly gather around the barbecue and make a
stockage which will admit no females. This is far too much fun for the
girlies. Let them make salad. Let them make coleslaw. Charcoal and
tapers at the ready, the men huddle together and prepare for the
ultimate male bonding ritual, forming a magic circle, as if what they
are about to do is deadly secret, clearly believing that the act they
are about to perform is the very essence of man -- the making of fire.
Barbecues officially sanctify the little-boy urge to play with matches
and are even more macho than bonfire night. Look out; this is primal
emotions stuff. Man makes fire. Man slaps down meat on table for family.
They start to look almost wistful as they turn the bacon. They are
probably fantasising about going the whole hog; instead of popping along
to Safeway they should have hunted, slaughtered, and skinned the beast
themselves.
A barbecue certainly polarises the sexes and reinforces stereotypes.
While the chaps pretend to be manly we chicks suddenly come over all
Jane Austen and start fainting all over the place. This is from hunger.
Thank God for the coleslaw and salad and 24 boxes of crisps. Having
decided to be in charge of the cooking the guys have to make an
elaborate ritual out of it, concocting diverse procedures like the
Coaxing of the Coals and the Marinating of the Meat.
Guys who couldn't even pass the Taste Challenge between mayonnaise and
salad cream start arguing vehemently over the exact quantity of Tobasco
to be used before settling for simply dousing the lot with half a can of
heavy.
Already the party is pretty pooped, there's little mingling going down
as the men have to stay static, the Guardians of the Barbecue. They
stand legs akimbo, clutching 2ft-long skewers and tongs in the same way
Italian waiters yield those long, thick peppermills, but the hoped-for
macho effect is somewhat offset by the ludicrously floppy chef's hat and
the obligatory full-length plastic apron.
The latter comes in two varieties -- a man-sized bottle of HP or the
saucier scantily clad female in sussies. They both look stupid.
Emphasising that tending the barbie is real hard work the guys, poor
diddums, will periodically wipe their sweaty brows, although their faces
are actually flushed due to the vast amounts of lager they're consuming
rather than any heat from the coals. Which, come to mention it, are
cooling down rather than glowing red.
At this stage of the proceedings someone breaks into the next-door
neighbour's garage and procures a bottle of white spirit, and everyone's
too sozzled to notice or care that two paintbrushes have been steeping
in it. This is furtively tossed over the coals, resulting in some
satisfying angry looking flames -- and some very dodgy flavoured
burgers.
And finally the Magic Circle expels some sausages from its midst --
crisp on the outside and red raw in the middle. The chaps turn round
triumphant but we girls have long since decamped to the nearest Pizza
Hut. See ya boys. And as the embers start to dull, the puffed-out chests
will deflate, the shoulders-back stance will crumble and the barbie
butches will disappear, revealing a typical specimen of the British
male; one who never does the clearing up.

FOR gloomy Scottish Conservatives gathering at their conference this
week, there might be consolation in the victory of Jacques Chirac and
his Gaullists in the French presidential poll. It shows how a party can
rise from the grave.
Not since 1974, the death of President Pompidou, have the Gaullists
really ruled France. After that came Valery Giscard d'Estaing, but he
belonged to their coalition rather than their party, and they always
thought him a bit of a turncoat and ratbag. Worse, he lost in 1981 to
the left, which has stayed in office ever since, the very thing that
General De Gaulle's Fifth Republic was designed to avoid.
Now, after 20 years, Gaullism is back. It is a strange movement, but I
once had the chance to probe it a little when, briefly, I acted as an
adviser to it. Or perhaps that is too grand a term for the invitation I
got in the autumn of 1985 to join a Mediterranean cruise with some top
Gaullists and their party stalwarts, plotting a return to parliamentary
power in the elections then imminent.
The right duly won, and ushered in the period of cohabitation, with
Chirac as Prime Minister under Mitterrand. That government seemed full
of bright ideas, none of which came to much. As I remember, they anyway
did not include financial deregulation on the British model, the subject
of the lecture I was asked to deliver to the bigwigs.
When we embarked on our luxurious liner at Nice, I found myself one of
several foreigners called on for the benefit of our national experience:
a Canadian expert on welfare, the director of the Swiss health service,
two fat Belgian senators, and so on.
These had French as their mother tongue, which did not stop them being
treated with a suspicion bordering on contempt as hailing from inferior
imitations of France. That could not apply in my case, though one of our
hosts did snarl at me: ''America is your colony; you are our colony''.
My standing was not helped by the fact that the only other Brits on
board were a troupe of ''jeunes danseuses anglaises'' who performed
floorshows in the evenings and then, presumably, further services for
the hot-blooded Gaullists.
As we sailed for Naples, it became clear that, apart from sex, food
was the real business. At the first dinner, waiters came straightaway to
take our orders. We foreigners, corraled together below the salt, looked
around in confusion, for there was no menu. Of course not, we were told,
we could have what we wanted.
I thought of something unlikely and said: ''Partridge''. My waiter did
not bat an eyelid: ''And what sauce do you desire, Monsieur?'' The only
compulsory item was caviare, of which a portion was placed at each
setting, every night. You can actually get bored with it, and some
Gaullists did. I saw one bulk his out with scrambled eggs, and another
with potatoes, mashing the caviare into them.
Lunch was less formal, and as we approached Palermo I wangled myself
on to the table of Jacques Medecin, the famously shady mayor of Nice,
accompanied by his security men, squat, silent Corsicans with stubbly
jowls and bulging oxters. I ventured a question about Graham Greene, who
in his book J'Accuse let the world know how Nice had been run by
Medecin's family for 50 years. ''Qui?'' said the mayor, ''I do not know
this name.''
By the time we reached Tunis I was growing more ambitious and trying
to strike up conversation with Francois Leotard, who as mayor of Frejus
got embroiled in some murky little affairs of his own. It did not
afterwards stop him becoming Minister of Culture, for which if nothing
else his name well suited him. In the latest government he has been
Minister of Defence, but seems due for a swift fall because he supported
Edouard Balladur against Chirac. He was singularly uncommunicative
anyway.
The only one of these panjandrums at all matey was Alain Madelin. For
a Frenchman he had an uncommon interest in free markets, and the most
picturesquely broken nose I ever saw. Somebody told me he had got it
playing rugby, somebody else that it was the legacy of leading a
street-gang of Gaullists in punch-ups with the students in 1968. In any
event, during the election he has hitched his colours very firmly to
Chirac's mast, and can expect a sizeable reward. He is a man to watch.
My own moment of glory came as we ploughed the waves back towards
Corsica. It could have been a disaster. The night before my lecture I
had repaired after dinner to the bar, whisky being unavailable at the
table, to have a dram or two before bed. A wild-eyed man lurched in,
looked at me tragically and asked: ''Do you wish to know why I resigned
my prefecture?''
There was only one answer to this, but I am afraid I did not give it.
A long session followed, during which I got as drunk as he had been at
the outset, and he turned comatose. I think he wanted to show me that
Mitterrand was a puppet of the communists.
The next morning, the Big Bang I had to talk about seemed to be mostly
in my head. But the alcohol still coursing through my veins let me read
my text with what I considered a certain Gallic panache. Not that it
mattered: they had no idea what I was on about. What, however, did I
learn from them? I found that Gaullists are not interested in policies,
only in power, a good start for any Conservative party.
They are rooted in their localities, adept at back-scratching and
glad-handing. They just love being French, making love, and guzzling
away to prove it, and they think France the greatest country in the
world. Perhaps in all this there is indeed a lesson for Scots Tories.

Ross Finlay examines the benefits of a new concept in car sales
AFTER a long and entertaining promotional campaign, the revolutionary
retailing methods of the Korean Daewoo company are up and running in the
UK -- although at low revs in Scotland. Down south, Daewoo cars can be
bought at the company's motor shows and car centres, located in retail
parks, but for a while longer, and probably till the end of the year,
the only way to buy one here will be via the Halfords garage servicing
network.
Although the UK sales launch of the two-model range of Nexias and
Esperos was at the beginning of last month, it is only round about now
that all the relevant Halfords outlets should have full information on
sales and servicing of the new cars. I have the impression that there
was a pretty big rush on the Koreans' part to get any kind of toehold on
the UK market.
In doing away with a traditional dealer network -- in effect, Halfords
simply takes customers' orders -- Daewoo has gone against all
conventional wisdom in the British motor trade, except in the case of
some very low-volume specialist manufacturers. Although the board
directors of the wholly-owned British subsidiary are all Koreans, they
have taken on marketing executives with experience of many different
home-built makes, and it is these people who came up with the sales
system inspired by GM's Saturn operation in the US.
Daewoo publicity makes great play of the fact that this group, with
interests not just in vehicles but also in ships, aerospace, earthmoving
machinery, electronics and hotels -- and with assembly plants in exotic
locations like Uzbekistan -- is ranked number 33 in the Fortune 500 list
of the world's biggest companies. But it is by no means the biggest of
the South Korean conglomerates.
Nevertheless, it has a vast amount of money invested, and planned for
future investment, in the motor industry. That Daewoo means business in
Europe is shown by its actions in recruiting its technical director from
Porsche, and taking over the well thought-of IAD design centre at
Worthing.
At the moment, and this is very much the Korean way of working, the
cars it is marketing here are not new designs. The Nexia is a fairly
mild development of the one-generation-back Astra, and the Espero is a
further modification of a previous Cavalier.
I think the best Daewoo for a value-conscious customer is probably the
entry-level 1.5 litre three-door Nexia at #8,295.
Anybody who owned a similar Astra will recognise the Nexia both in its
exterior lines, although there is a new and neatly designed rear end
treatment, and in the interior layout. But there are many detail
changes, in features like the front bumper and the design of the wipers.
And the five-speed transmission is new.
A short introductory test run suggested that in performance, economy,
ride and handling the Nexia is very similar to the car on which it is
based. The 0-60mph sprint takes about 12.5 seconds, the test track
maximum is around 100mph, and fuel consumption returns range from 53mpg
at 56mph to 43 at 75 and 32mpg in city traffic.
The remarkable thing is just how much comes for that #8,295
non-negotiable showroom price. Anti-lock brakes are standard on all
Daewoos. Delivery to the buyer's home or office is included. So are
number plates, a tankful of petrol, 30 days' exchange or return
facilities, free collection and delivery for regular servicing, a mobile
phone and, perhaps most significant of all, three years' servicing
including the cost of both parts and labour.
Taking all that into account, the #8,295 price tag looks more and more
competitive. There is nothing wrong with the Nexia as a slightly
outdated design.
I agree with those industry figures who reckon that the whole Daewoo
operation in the UK will be either a howling success or impossible to
sustain, with no middle ground. With first month sales of 1503 from a
partial network, the figns are promising.

THE first division title race maybe exciting -- three clubs have a
chance of winning the championship -- but it has given the Scottish
League a headache for Saturday.
League officials would like to present the trophy to the champions
after the final whistle, but the problem is who, and where.
Raith Rovers, Dunfermline, and Dundee all are in with a chance. Raith
are at Firhill to meet Hamilton, Dunfermline are at home to Clydebank,
while Dundee visit Stranraer.
Jim Kilpatrick, a league official, said: ''We are having talks with
all three clubs and drawing up plans to keep in close touch with all
three games.''
Meanwhile, Hamilton have arranged that the Jackie Husband Stand at
Firhill, not normally opened for their games, will be available.
Secretary Scott Struthers said: ''That should hold the Raith support
while our fans will be in the main stand.''
* CELTIC defender Tony Mowbray has been the subject of scrutiny by
Manchester City.
The Maine Road side dispatched their chief scout, Jimmy Frizzell, to
watch the central defender at Brockville when Celtic beat Falkirk 2-1.
But City could have some competition in the race to fix up Mowbray,
with Bolton also interested in the #500,000-rated man.

YVONNE Murray, Scotland's Commonwealth 10,000 metres champion, will
have a testing start to her 1995 campaign -- one which may give a
significant pointer to the chances of her fulfilling her ambition for
the year, the world 10,000m track title in Gothenburg.
Murray will have her debut outing of the season on the road, in
Portsmouth a fortnight on Saturday, and yesterday her principal opponent
was identified as Olympic 10,000m champion Derartu Tulu, of Ethiopia.
Scotland's Liz McColgan, who took the 1991 world 10,000m title ahead
of Tulu, also hopes to run in the BUPA Portsmouth International 5000m
road event, but has yet to be confirmed, following a recurrence of an
iron deficiency.
Tulu, whose career, ironically, had been threatened by a knee injury,
just like former world and Commonwealth champion McColgan, demonstrated
her return to form earlier this year by winning the world cross-country
title.
That re-established her as the principal rival whom the two Scots will
face later this year when both intend to challenge for the world 10,000m
track title.
Their first meeting, however, will be on the road -- but it will be
later this week before Murray learns whether she also will be meeting
McColgan. ''I've made a good recovery from the London Marathon,'' said
Liz. ''But I'm waiting for the result of iron tests. I believe an iron
deficiency cost me Olympic gold in Barcelona.
''I was told then that the problem could have been life-threatening,
so I am careful now -- I have my iron level checked regularly. Recently
we spotted a problem, and it should soon be back up. If I am not right
in time for Portsmouth, I will not be going. The world championships are
my next target, and I'm not going to jeopardise that.''
Murray said that she had no qualms about facing Tulu so early in the
year: ''It will be great to get back racing again. I have worked hard
all winter, and this gives me something to focus on.
''I have not gone abroad to train -- I preferred training at home with
my clubmates. At the moment I feel I am holding myself back. Gothenburg
in August is what matters.''

PREDICTING what will happen in the dairy markets is worse than betting
on horses, Mr James Murphy, president of the Scottish Dairy Association,
said yesterday.
Speaking at the Scottish Dairy Conference in Peebles, he said there
was an argument that prices were currently overheated -- but the acid
test would be what the supermarkets and consumers were prepared to pay.
''They are the only people who put money into the system,'' he added.
At the end of the day, he said, people did not have to eat dairy
products. There were alternatives.
''I think all of us involved in dairy products are struggling to get
higher prices from our customers -- especially the supermarkets,'' he
told the opening session of the conference. The issue would be
compounded by the dangers of import penetration as a result of GATT
agreements. ''It is extremely easy to lose markets, but very difficult
to regain them,'' he warned.
The secretary general of the European Dairy Association, Mr Antoon van
de Ven, suggested that things were finely balanced on the price front at
European level. Supply was not exactly meeting increased demand, so
there was a tendency to high prices. One factor which had to be faced
was the emergence of the USA as a major player on the world market for
dairy products.
The fact that the Americans had little experience in that field did
not mean they should not be taken seriously. ''Experience and know-how
can be bought and a lot of people are willing to help them in the world
market,'' he said.
Despite growing competition from America, New Zealand and Australia,
he stood by the view that the European dairy industry was one of the
strongest in the world. The New Zealand industry as a whole was equal to
about two or three large dairy co-operatives in Europe, he said. ''If we
can stop thinking nationally and think instead on a European basis, we
have every possibility of staying as world market leaders.''
At the Scottish level, there was a general view that in the future
scale of operation would be of critical importance. The small producer
or processor would be unable to stay in business if they were
inefficient, said Mr Jim Brown, deputy chairman of Scottish Milk.
Mr Murphy supported that view, with a vision of the future lying in
bigger operating plants processing at least 200 million litres of milk.
''We may end up with multi-product plants because that is an efficient
way of balancing out the fluctuations of the week,'' he said.
Mr Brown adopted a bullish stance on prices. ''There is no indication
that prices will come down or need to come down,'' he told a news
conference at the end of the formal business. His forecast was that
prices could increase marginally.
Mr Richard Upson, assistant director of competition policy at the
Office of Fair Trading, said that their current stance was to give the
dairy industry a chance to settle in the wake of de-regulation. ''We are
not looking to make an early intervention,'' he said. ''Clearly there is
a lot of adaptation to take place still. It behoves us to give the many
players time to make changes before we consider intervention.''
The sheer size of Milk Marque south of the Border meant that it was a
major player in the UK scene and the sort of prices it fixed could have
a knock-on effect in Scotland. That was the sort of situation they would
want to look at, he said.

DECORATIVE painting effects like marbling, stencils and sponging are
very much a part of today's interior decor schemes, along with wood
staining which has got up off the floor to cover skirtings, doors,
walls, stairs, banisters and furniture.
The doyenne of paint effects is Jocasta Innes, who has written several
extremely popular books on the subject, and provides some guidelines on
how to combine these techniques effectively in an interior design.
Style is the key to a successful design, but it is also a concept
which is notoriously difficult to define. Sometimes style is linked to
exclusive and conformist connotations of ''good taste'' and
''elegance'', and while style can be both tasteful and elegant, it can
ignore these criteria -- as punk styles cheerfully demonstrate. The rich
can order good taste from a fashionable interior designer, but that's
not quite the same thing as style. ''I think we need to distinguish
between style and styles,'' Jocasta Innes says. ''The latter are
transitory and often a bit extreme, fun, sparky, stimulating, and while
they are worth trying out when one is young and a bit undefined, they
have the disadvantage of all exaggerated styles, they soon date and
ossify, while you are forever moving on.''
The best interior designs are created with the help of the spirit of
imaginative commonsense, and stylish rooms tend to be changing a little
all the time -- they are never static, sterile or unlived in. Pictures
get swapped round, new finds take pride of place, and sudden inspiration
might mean a radical change of the colour for the walls, or some light,
floating curtains for summer, completely altering the atmosphere in the
room.
Atmosphere in a place is like charm in a person, instantly felt and
recognised, but hard to pin down with words. Like charm, it exerts a
spell. A good atmosphere can be as reassuring as a friendly hug, and the
good feelings about a place will remain in the mind long after the
details of decor and furnishings are forgotten. There are some aids to
creating atmosphere, and a good firm of professional decorators will
have the skills to use to superb effect the rag-rolling, marbling and
staining paint and colour effects which help infuse a home with that
mysterious combination of atmosphere and style.
Jocasta Innes suggests that atmosphere can be created by using any, or
indeed all, of the following techiniques. Poetic colours, what
decorators call ''dirty'' colours -- raw umber mixed into almost any
colour dirties it appealingly -- and colours mixed in this way give a
gentle, moody look to a place.
''Any distressed paint finish helps inject atmosphere because it looks
softer, more suggestive, opened-out rather than walled-in,'' Jocasta
Innes explains. ''Painting everything one colour in a room (except the
ceiling) walls, woodwork, shelves, as I have done in my own blue study,
makes a place look and feel peaceful and nurturing.''
Bare floors are aids to atmosphere. Wooden floors, bare but not
shabby, and stained green or red and waxed over, with a few rugs to
soften the effect, give surprising character to a room. They also look
good and a touch historical, painted, then stencilled or chequered and
varnished.
Of all the many ways of introducing colour to your home, one of the
best is with paint. The beauty of paint, whether on walls, ceilings,
floors, woodwork or furniture, is that if things don't turn out quite as
expected, the results can be modified or corrected relatively easily.
Transparent glazes used in one of the fashionable stippled, ragged or
sponged finishes are easy to apply and can be used to soften,
strengthen, warm or cool the ground colour. Playing about with coloured
glazes and decorative finishes will help you develop a sound colour
sense.
Before calling in a professional decorating firm, buy yourself some
scumble glaze and tubes of artists' oil paints and try different
combinations of these over a favourite base colour. The basic range of
universe stainers are cheaper than artists' quality colours, and a good
way to develop some skill is to try mixing them to match paper or fabric
which you like. Mix unexpected colours, and brush, rag or sponge your
glaze over a sizable patch of wall behind furniture, and stand back,
move around and move pieces of furniture or cushions against it to gauge
the effect.
Don't forget to make notes of what you are doing, so that when you've
got the formula right, you know what you'll need to tell the decorator
to recreate it. Most professional designers create a colour scheme
slowly, leaving as many options as possible open for as long as
possible.
One of the paradoxes of personal style which Jocasta Innes has
observed is that while it changes superficially over the years,
recording passing enthusiasms and influences, it usually maintains an
inner consistency, the fingerprints of its author coming through
everything like the lettering in a stick of rock.
In the homes of people who have a strong sense of colour, the colours
everywhere will intermingle like old friends, and the continuity of
rooms gives the sense of a house as an organism.

REGULATOR Stephen Littlechild's comments earlier this year about
tighter control of regional electricity companies sent a negative
current through Glasgow Income Trust.
The investment trust's underperformance in the six months to end-March
was yesterday laid at the door of Professor Littlechild, who triggered a
decline in the value of the #14m fund's electrical holdings.
Glasgow Income, which is managed by Glasgow Investment Managers, made
a total return on net assets of 2.8%, compared with one of 4.0% on its
benchmark All-Share index.
Its 0.5% setback in net asset value, to 45.08p, also compared poorly
with the All-Share's performance in capital terms.
Although first-half earnings per share of 1.53p were up 30% on the
equivalent period of the previous financial year, Glasgow Income made it
clear this was the result of special dividends from electricity
companies.
It announced a second interim dividend of 0.6p, making a total of 1.2p
for the year to date. These payouts are in line with the previous year.
On a more positive note, Glasgow Income believes there could soon be a
rise in the prices of higher-yielding stocks.

THE Norwegian owners of Kvaerner Govan shipyard said yesterday that
its 1300 workers must improve productivity if they hope to land a major
new contract this summer. Company bosses were quick to say that no more
layoffs were planned, following the dismissal of 300 temporary workers
at the Clyde shipyard earlier this year.
But Kvaerner singled Govan out for criticism in its quarterly
statement and company vice-president Diderik Schnitler warned that an
expected new order worth #40m to #80m might go to Kvaerner's more
efficient Rostock yard in Germany instead.
Kvaerner, the biggest shipbuilding group in Europe, announced a 42%
rise in pre-tax profits to 587m Norwegian kroner during the first
quarter of this year, to which a good performance by its shipbuilding
division contributed 307m.
But the company said: ''earnings at Kvaerner Govan in Britain...remain
unsatisfactory.''
''Productivity is not good enough,'' Mr Schnitler said.
Workers at Govan had a poor record for finishing jobs well before
passing them on to a colleague for the next stage of the production
process, he said.
''You have to be sure that what you give over to the next man in line
is as good as possible. Figures for the re-doing of welding for example
are too high,'' Mr Schnitler said.
The glittering prize being dangled before Govan's nose is a contract
to build a command ship for a floating platform that would launch
satellites from the Pacific Ocean.
Kvaerner has formed a joint venture with US planemaker Boeing and
space technology companies from Russia and the Ukraine to launch up to
20 communications satellites per year from a floating platform at more
than $75m a shot.
Mr Schnitler said there was ''more than a 50-50 chance'' that this
project would go ahead in the Summer.
He recognised that Govan, which was making losses of #30m to #40m per
year when Kvaerner bought it seven years ago, had dramatically improved
productivity was now making a small profit, but he said it was not big
enough.
''It is in the black, but not to the right magnitude,'' he said.
The Kvaerner vice-president said an internal drive was under way at
Govan to try to remedy the situation, but the yard was not yet
performing as well as its in-house German competitors.
''The German yards are even better on productivity. They pay higher
wages and they have higher productivity too, but they have some problems
on cost,'' Mr Schnitler said.
A decisive factor in awarding the Sea Launch contract could be the
financing scheme that goes with it, he added, hinting that the UK and
German governments may offer sweeteners.
Mr Schnitler dismissed any suggestion of further layoffs at Govan,
which is currently completing work on a chemicals carrier and has
another year of work to go on a helicopter assault ship. The yard is due
to start building a #12m offshore supply vessel in the autumn.

I MET a former German soldier once (he was driving a coal truck for
the British Army Of the Rhine) who had been to Moscow in November, 1941.
His unit took lunch in a tram, sitting on its rail line: someone could
read Cyrillic and discerned that the sign on the front announced that
the tram ran to the Kremlin.
They never made it any further, of course. My acquaintance saw many
other battles during those dreadful years. The one that most impressed
us teenage British soldiers was in Berlin. At the height of an Allied
air-raid, as every building burned and the very air was sucked up and
consumed, the soldier and hundreds of others lay head to foot down the
centre of a wide boulevard. It was the safest place to be, and the
flames from either side met above their heads.
That man's personal odyssey was the history of the Germans in the
twentieth century. They almost conquered the world. At their furthest
advance, they could see the domes and spires of the Kremlin in the
distance -- and they ended in the most frightful conflagration any
European country has ever suffered.
One of the points of all the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary
is that the ''short twentieth century'' as historians call it, which ran
from 1914 to 1989, from the beginning of all the disasters in Sarajevo
to the collapse of the Soviet empire, can now be formally buried. It's
all over, and we won't have to note any more anniversaries.
Instead, we are back where our grandfathers were in 1914, with trouble
in the Balkans and the perennial question of how to integrate the
Russians into the rest of the continent.
Then, as now, the country was moving from tyranny to democracy. The
difference is that things looked brighter for Russia then than they do
now: if it had continued on its pre-war path, undisturbed by war and
revolution, Russia would now be a real super-power, in economic terms as
well as in military force.
As it is, that much-diminished shell of a country may yet recover the
hopes of 1914, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. The latest
American-Russian summit opens today after the parades and banquets, and
President Clinton is faced with the difficult task of putting maximum
pressure on the Russians to fall into line without so irritating them
that they reject everything Western in one spasm of xenophobia.
The timing is not propitious, just because of the memory of the
Germans reaching the suburbs 54 years ago, and the desperate battles
across the width of the country and on to Berlin. Like the British (but
not the Americans), the Russians have been heavily engaged in one last
exercise of nostalgia, with memories of the glorious and terrible days
when they saved themselves and Europe.
Now comes Bill Clinton and tells them that they must allow Poland and
the others to join Nato, must stop selling nuclear technology to Iran,
must stop destroying Chechnya, must adopt Western ways more quickly, and
so on. We are told that things are going better for the Russians now
that the economy is on the mend. But tell that to anyone surviving on
#30 a month, and go on to tell him that Russia must do as it's told.
They will refuse to listen, of course. Russo-American relations have
deteriorated sharply in the past year, and it will be most astonishing
if this summit does anything to reverse the decline.
The Americans (and perhaps even the British) have come around to the
view that Nato will have to be enlarged, that whatever the Russians say
it is more important to establish stable, democratic governments tied to
the West in eastern Europe than it is to placate Moscow.
Then there is the matter of nuclear disarmament. The Americans may, or
may not, be right in suspecting that Iran intends to build nuclear
weapons, using technology acquired from Russia. What is quite clear is
that the bad blood between America and Russia has been much exacerbated
by the latest row, and means that the Start II treaty has had to be
shelved.
Perhaps Mr Clinton might have won over the Russians by going to their
parades and memorials -- but with the Russian Army pulverising Chechnya,
he could hardly do that.
He had to go to Moscow. These fiftieth anniversaries are serious
matters, and he would have given mortal offence by skipping the show. He
tried to get out of it, but the force of history was against him.
It did not help that he launched the latest attack on Russia, over its
sale of nuclear technology to Iran, a week ago.
But let's look on the bright side: we have been through far worse than
this. Just think of those Germans in their blazing city.

A FORMER prominent Clyde Coast cafe is now offering a menu of 31
apartments. Admiral's Court is a development at Gourock by Carvill
(Scotland) Ltd on a site where the cafe, once a famous landmark in the
town, had fallen into disrepair.
The design of the apartments has been planned to incorporate
traditional Scottish features such as parapet roofs and bay windows in a
bid to ensure that the new building complements its surroundings. Prices
are expected to range from approximately #44,000 to #70,000.
In keeping with the seafaring traditions of the local area, the
individual apartments have been named after paddle steamers which once
journeyed up and down the Clyde - the Waverley, the Caledonia, the
Lorne, the Fyfe, the Graham, the Columbia and the Montrose
Carvill properties carry a 10-year NHBC warranty and are fitted with
hard-wired smoke alarms, window locks and security door entrance
systems.
The first of the apartments at Admiral's Court should be ready for
occupation by the end of this year.
Isobel Cochrane, sales negotiator for Admiral's Court, says: ''This is
an exciting development. Visitors can experience the advantages of views
across the water when they visit our on-site sales cabin, which is open
daily.''
Carvill is building a range of properties at its Westlake development
in Cumbernauld, and Ardenwood in Alexandria.

NOW that Will Carling has taken the wind, or whatever, out of their
sails, the English rugby selectors must be desperate to find new ways to
tame their truculent captain. The Diary is keen to help, not because it
much likes buffoons in blazers but because it likes smug English rugby
captains even less.
Here's a thought. Given that the RFU was unable to find any member of
the team prepared to take over Carling's job, why does it not adopt the
same approach as the Geelong Australian Rules side, whose skipper, Gary
Hocking, has just resigned? Rather than mess around, the club has
appointed three ''co-captains'' after discovering that the Los Angeles
Lakers basketball side has two, that the San Francisco 49ers American
football side gets by with four skippers, and that the Oakland Athletics
Baseball Company has no captain but ''an informal leadership system''.
Scotland's only hope, needless to say, might be to name everyone
captain. At least then we'd know who to blame.
Flights of fancy
CAMPAIGNERS seeking to defend threatened languages and dialects --
Gaelic, Glaswegian, Perth Conservatism and the like -- will be thrilled
to hear from Papua New Guinea that Pidgin, or Tok Pisin, is alive and
well. More than that, it is by all accounts busily developing new words
to meet the challenge of the modern world.
Thus, though the Queen is still Misis Kwin, and Prince Charles
remains, as he doubtless always will, Pikinini bilong Misis Kwin, an
armed hold-up is now ''hansupim''; something broken or ruined is
entirely ''bagarap'', and the act of deliberately deceiving another is
known, naturally enough, as ''bulsitim''. But of course.

SPEAKING of Pikinini bilong Misis Kwin, we were childishly delighted
yesterday to note that the kiss exchanged by the boy and his wife (Misis
Frocks no bilong Pikinini?) which caused so much excitement among the
tabloids has just been reported to the good folk of America. It came to
them via the Reuters news agency's Variety/Entertainment wire service.
Barely believable
ANOTHER tale coming our way from the southern hemisphere tends to
suggest, perhaps, that Australia's macho image might be under a little
pressure.
Lawyers acting for former Bondi police constable and part-time model
Sue Miller, forced to resign from the force recently after she was named
Penthouse Pet of the Year, claim she is a victim of sexism.
In 1992, it has been pointed out, a male officer posed nude for
Australia's Women Forum magazine, and no-one held a thing against him.
But what makes matters worse, according to Sue's supporters, is that
other male officers have been allowed to work in their spare time -- as
dancers. The flying squad, obviously.
Behind the scenes
THE first rule of film criticism is that film critics watch too many
films.
Were it otherwise, they wouldn't try to kid the rest of us that more
than one in every 200 movies is worth seeing.
Roger Ebert happens to be an American reviewer, and a famous one at
that. He can be forgiven, we feel, if only because he compiled a little
volume entitled Ebert's Little Movie Glossary, possibly the first
sociological study to explain why most audiences of most films know
exactly what's about to happen next. Herewith a few of Mr Ebert's
explanations.
Ali MacGraw's Disease: ''Movie illness in which the only symptom is
that the sufferer grows more beautiful as death approaches''.
Back Seat Inviso-Syndrome: ''Film characters are invariably unable to
see a person crouched in the back seat of a car when, in the real world,
it is an impossible place for a person to hide''.
The Bad Smoker Rule: ''In any cop movie since the mid-70s, the bad
guys smoke, while the good guy is trying to quit''.
The Fallacy of Elaborate Death Techniques: ''Any method of attempting
to kill someone in a movie that is more complicated than shooting,
beating, strangling, etc.''
The Mid-Wife Crisis: ''Any character whose wife and/or kids are
introduced more than an hour into the movie and who hugs and kisses any
or all of them will be dead within the next 20 minutes.''
The Odds on Edge Rule: ''The odds that a car in real life will be able
to travel any appreciable distance balanced on two wheels: one in seven
million. The odds that this will happen in a car chase in a movie: one
in 43.''
The Rising Sidewalk Rule: ''No female character in an action film can
flee more than 50ft before falling flat on her face.''
The Sex-Specific Disintegrating Outfit: ''When the male and female
characters in a trashy action movie go to hell and back, only the
woman's clothing begins to disintegrate''.
The Wunza Movie: ''Any film using a plot which can be summarised by
saying ''One's a . . .' For example, ''One's a cop. One's an actor.''
Plainly, Mr Ebert knows his business. In his glossary he also reproduces
Sturgeon's Law, attributed to the science-fiction writer Theodore
Sturgeon: ''90% of everything is crap''.
Bottom line
STILL with movies, we read that the British production house Working
Title has had another hit in the US, this time with a piece entitled
French Kiss and starring Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline.
True to its name, the picture was shot in Paris, and to pass the time
during its making Kline attempted to teach his co-star a bit of the
local lingo. Ryan almost cracked it, spending three weeks saying ''Merci
beau cul'' to everyone she met.
Translated into Californian that's ''Thanks, nice ass''.
Civil defence
FINALLY, a less-than-tasteful item that happens to be perfectly true.
After Oklahoma City, and amid growing unease around the world that the
Internet's cherished anarchy is providing a refuge for militarist nuts,
pornographers, and assorted terrorist networks, the FBI and CIA have
stepped up their electronic surveillance of the data highway.
Fair enough, were it not for the fact that Net users are keen on their
civil liberties and ready to defend them. Hence the increasing tendency
of those using USENET (loosely a vast discussion area within the system)
to include the words ''bomb'' or ''terrorist'' in their messages.
Nothing to do with violent intent, you understand, and everything to
do with overloading the CIA's hugely expensive computer scanning
equipment.

ON the day that official figures revealed that 20% of Strathclyde's
population needed the help of Income Support to survive, it was more
than a little ironic that Gordon Brown should be proclaiming that new
Labour will be the ''consumers' champion''.
Mr Brown's words can have brought very little comfort or hope to the
many thousands of people throughout the West of Scotland who are forced
through no fault of their own to live a hand-to-mouth existence.
Mr Brown's statement, like many of those recently issued by his party
leader, is clearly aimed at the middle classes of England who have to be
won over to ensure a Labour victory at the next election. While this
policy may be innately sensible and smack of realpolitik, the reality
for many of the impoverished people of Scotland is that it is not going
to make a great deal of difference to their lot.
The past 16 years under the Tories have been all about consumerism and
looking after the South-east of England. It seems that little is going
to change under Labour.
Having dispatched the left into oblivion along with Clause 4, Mr Blair
and Mr Brown have indeed created a new Labour Party which according to
their words will champion ''competition and consumerism''. One wag has
dubbed new Labour as ''the political wing of Which magazine''.
While the prospect of power may be adequate compensation for many in
the Labour Party to accept such ridicule, those on the Scottish left
must now be wondering whether or not their spiritual values have moved
to another party.

I WAS a little comforted to learn from your municipal corrspondent
that the Labour interim Convener of the new East Renfrewshire Shadow
Council intends to pursue a Conservative agenda (May 1).
This will be executed, apparently, with a Labour minority group not
experienced in the full breadth of local government matters, a leader
who seems to have determined Eastwood's needs on a brief acquaintance,
and a track record that denies Labour's smart newspeak.
It was Labour who raised parents' fears for education, it was Labour
who, for 20 years, failed to bring Strathclyde's police force up to
establishment, it was Labour who directed resources for major services,
such as nursery education, out of areas like Eastwood, and it was Labour
who gave council tax payers no choice but to pay 14% more this year for
Strathclyde's services.
In Renfrew district, Labour offer pensioners a trip to Dunoon or a
gift voucher for which they and everyone else will have to pay whether
they would choose to do so or not. Pensioners' preference may be for #20
off their council tax rather than a #10 voucher and a lot of unnecessary
council administration.
Nothing would please the East Renfrewshire Conservative Group more
than to have consensus support for their fair manifesto policies, but
New Labour does not in fact exist. Old Labour still expects to pursue
its traditional policies when it thinks it cannot be challenged.
Together with the difficulty Labour will encounter when trying to
implement policies for which it has not planned and expressed no
commitment at the election, Labour's present caution in East
Renfrewshire arises mainly out of the knowledge that nine experienced
Conservative councillors won't miss them if they step out of line and
their party would never forgive them if they rock the boat by acting
naturally.

SCOT FM chairman, Sir David Steel, is quoted in your paper as being
pleased with the success Scot FM has enjoyed with good audience figures
(May 2).
He states: ''These are wonderful figures and are testament to all the
hard work and dedication shown by the team at Scot FM against fierce
opposition.''
Sir David seems to claim that quality in radio broadcasting means
having the most listeners. I would suggest that attitude is being
basically flawed. Quality and quantity are not the same thing.
I don't believe for a moment that Sir David or Jimmy Gordon tune in to
their respective commercial stations, either at home or in their cars.
Do they never tune to Radio 4, Radio 3, or Classic FM? I'd bet they
do, but they'd never admit it, would they?
Finally, I note that Scot FM claims better listening figures than
Classic FM. Me? Sad but glad!

YOU report that there was a furious response to the reference by
Richard Ottaway, MP, to Scotland as a region of England (May 1).
This sort of thing is humiliating and happens frequently, but why
should resentment be directed towards Mr Ottaway? He is only recognising
a fact; a fact which has been in existence since 1707, and which will
remain so until we regain our independence.
In the whole wide world, the only people who do not accept this fact
are those anglophile Scots who try to pretend that our country has some
sort of status and that we have some sort of national identity.
Only when we have earned the respect due to a free nation state,
taking its rightful place in the international community, will such
humiliation cease.

THE Scottish Tory hierarchy and Mr Godfrey's vain attempt to equate
the SNP with Hitler and Nazi Germany sound like the death throes of a
party that has lost all contact with the people of Scotland it would
claim to represent.
Hitler was a supreme Unionist who centrlaised all the state powers in
himself. He attempted to use racism to achieve his own imperialistic
goals. As I understand it, we went to war with him because he was
ruthlessly overrunning the smaller independent countries in Europe in a
determined attempt to get rid of the Jews, blacks, gipsies, and other
ethnic minorities and dissidents in order to establish the Third Reich
over all Europe and eventually the whole world.

THE ''ghost train'', to run from Maryhill to Bishopbriggs to keep the
line technically open, recalls the Parliamentary train of last century
run similarly at any old hour, with long stops in sidings to get out of
the way, but technically satisfying the requirement in the Act of
Parliament to stop at certain unimportant stations, which was a
condition of having the line laid over that land.
One of the Mikado's punishments to fit the crime was to ride on a
buffer in Parliamentary trains; the ticket price was nominal but was all
poor Eric or Little by Little could afford when he went home to die
after slipping gradually into evil ways and running away from school.
Retribution was stern last century. I am sure we could all think of
people we would like to condemn to ride for ever, like the Flying
Dutchman, from Maryhill to Bishopbriggs and back.

AS a regular user of trains and maps I was amused when the desirable
error on the comprehensive Scottish transport map (Largs-Wemyss Bay rail
link) was pointed out on your letters page recently.
The map with Iain Wilson's article excels this manyfold (May 3). I
always thought that the Cowlairs chord line ran from Springburn into
Queen Street and thus the diverted Inverness to Glasgow train will run
via the chord line.
Perhaps someone can also explain the asterisks which would appear to
represent both the south curve at the Cowlairs triangle used by Maryhill
and West Highland services, and the main line to Edinburgh and Stirling.
Maybe Cowlairs is Glasgow's equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle -- where
all the trains disappear.
Still I am excited by the prospect of a service running from Stirling
via Cumbernauld, but suggest that this is also the mysterious 23.48, aka
the 20.08 from Inverness. Are they perhaps related?
If this can be done for one service why don't we have all the services
between Inverness and Glasgow via this route and make a stab at a decent
service paralleling the M80/A80 corridor, or perhaps ScotRail and SPTE
can extend the current Cumbernauld/Queen Street service by way of an
alternative.

I HEARTILY agree with Brian Meek about air travel (May 4).
However, having recently returned from a tripo to Australia and the
Far East on which we were on no fewer than six flights, all with
Singapore Airlines, I have to say they were all superb.
Every flight left and arrived on time. The courtesy of the cabin staff
was exemplary, comfort came first and they could not do enough for the
passengers, even giving little shades through the night if you couldn't
sleep.
Socks, blankets, pillows, eyeshields, toothbrushes and paste were all
supplied. The loos were checked every hour to make sure they were clean.
This wasn't cabin class, it was economy, and we had reasonable
leg-room. Of course Singapore Airlines are top of the list in the league
table; British Airways about eighth.
BA should take a leaf out of SA's book.

SCOTLAND'S largest governing body confesses (May 1) that the vast sums
it has spent on social engineering have been in vain, though its report
comprises enigmatic statistics without the leavening of insights from
its highly critical, blighted recipients.
This allows Strathclyde Regional Council's leaders to pass the buck on
to the Edinburgh and Whitehall administrations whose only major crime
has been inadequately to monitor and question their spends.
Arguing the merits of whether the town clerk or a regional depute
should lead the city's unitary authority beggars belief; the Year of
Architecture campaign was last-gaspingly life-saved by a Liverpudlian
outsider and the irrepressible Pat Lally in unaccustomed saintly mode.
Both these pompous bureaucracies which operated in a cold war of their
own have been grossly out-performed by the now defunct New Towns and a
certain Highland authority run by competent youngsters who focused on
extracting the maximum benefit from the public purse for the public
good.
Congratulations should go to those who selected them and then allowed
them to get on with their job.

I READ with interest the article by Raymond Duncan, Kirk in bid to
interest young people (April 26).
Over the last 25 years the numbers attending Sunday Schools, Bible
Classes and Youth Fellowships have been decreasing and it is not
surprising that the report from the Board of Parish Education to the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is showing that the Sunday
School movement is in a state of chronic decline.
As a former Sunday School superintendent I find it amazing that the
Church of Scotland is only now thinking of involving young adults to
take a more active part in the courts of the Church.
I would suggest that, not only young adults take a more positive part,
but older children become more involved in the running of their Sunday
School and leave the adults to adopt the role of advisers when
requested. This may possibly stop the decline in the numbers attending.

WHAT on earth is the Scottish police force coming to? A good natured
cocker spaniel -- confronted by a policeman making his presence known at
an unearthly hour of the night -- gives the apparent intruder a nip on
the ankles and a tug at his coat; and for that reason this family pet
(which didn't even bite the constable) is deemed dangerous in protecting
its mistress; and consequently three judges must decide whether or not
the gentle spaniel is to be destroyed.
If, in this age of police impotence against rising crime, the force
had nothing better to do than condemn a pet nervously guarding its
mistress then Heaven help us!
As for the constable who kicked this dumb animal, and then made a
charge against it, the fierce beast that should be charged should surely
be himself.
Good PR efforts by a police force can take years to build; but
regrettably, they can be shattered in a day.

IN my experience most people who actually fought in the war don't care
to talk about it all that much.
That is certainly the case with my father despite some merciless
family ribbing that the sinking of his ship was the sole Italian success
in the entire hostilities.
In point of fact this turns out to be wrong on two counts. First the
Italian air force inflicted some real damage in the Mediterranean
campaign and secondly faither's fleet carrier actually limped back to
Gibraltar.
I can't recall my grandad ever talking about his time in the Army. I
always suspected that this might be something to do with his own
brother's name on the war memorial in St Ninian's kirk. He may have seen
it as somehow disrespectful to the fallen to talk with any bombast about
the experience of the lucky ones -- the act of remembrance was
sufficient.
I've no doubt that this reticence is shared by many people from many
families. It stands in stark contrast to the blundering activities of
the Conservative candidate in Perth and Kinross.
As far as I am aware Mr John Godfrey has never heard a shot fired in
anger. The nearest he comes to real fear in his banking career may be a
few bad moments when the pound or the stock market or both have been on
the slide.
As we found out in spectacular fashion yesterday he doesn't even know
the name of a single surviving Scottish infantry regiment never mind
where and how they won their battle colours and at what cost in blood.
This hasn't stopped him, however, placing the Second World War at the
centre of his campaign. Apparently the political struggle in which
''Private Godfrey'' is now engaged somehow stands direct comparison with
the battle against fascism won 50 years ago.
He isn't the only politician to attempt to exploit national sacrifice
for political interest. The Prime Minister's ''backs to the wall''
declaration from Downing Street after the English local election results
on Friday was only saved from being totally tasteless by the comic
effect of him then saying that he was going to turn and face his
difficulties -- presumably bumping into the wall in the process!
Even the truly great aren't above the occasional low blow. Churchill
came famously unstuck in suggesting that Attlee's Government might need
a ''Gestapo'' while it was once said of Lloyd George that if you showed
him a belt he would hit below it.
However, if Godfrey is not the first to try it on he is certainly by
far the most incompetent. To attempt to run a Nazi smear on the SNP is a
tad foolish when tens of thousands of SNP supporters, in common with
supporters of all other parties, actually did the fighting which allows
Godfrey the freedom of speech which he so carelessly abuses.
Much worse is the attempt to incorporate VE Day into the Tory
by-election campaign. This is not even done subtly but in a weekend
leaflet headed up ''John Godfrey Says -- VE Day''.
Has the Tory Party become so boiled down to a few zealots that they
think this sort of material is remotely acceptable? Are they so seized
with panic on the state of their crumbling parliamentary majority that
they think what's left of their political reputation is of no importance
in a by-election?
Douglas Robson of the ''Save Our Infantry'' campaign described the
Tory material as ''the delirium of a dying party''. Other responses from
the constituency are equally effective if somewhat less printable.
We are told that the candidate wrote his own leaflets sitting in the
Tory bunker at Almondbank with portraits of the lost leaderine and
Winston Churchill bearing down upon him.
Perhaps he should recall that it was Churchill who once said something
about despising the Tory Party, detesting their men, and deploring their
methods.
The late MP for Perth and Kinross had a famously low opinion of his
prospective Tory replacement. In the space of one week of the campaign
the rest of us have discovered why.
But, and the Tory Party should mark these words, even Nicky's damning
indictment will be as of nothing compared to the judgment about to be
visited upon Godfrey by the people of the constituency.

SCOTRAIL stamped its tiny foot yesterday; in a huff, you see, but one
with dark implications for the travelling public. Lord Kirkwood, one of
the growing numbers of heroes of the British justiciary (a subject to
which we will return) had put a stop to a nefarious plan to dodge round
ScotRail's legal duties. The subject was, as it has been so often in
recent weeks, the Fort William to London sleeper service. Faced with the
chaos of privatisation and the need to prettify its books at Government
urging before the sell-off can proceed, ScotRail tried to short-circuit
the procedure for closing down the line. Worse, it indulged in the
shabby trick of attempting to circumvent the requirement for public
consultation by running empty trains on a section of the line. In a
sense these ''ghost trains'' and the subterfuge which accompanied them
can be seen as an image of the whole shoddy, cack-handed mess which has
been made of rail privatisation. The entire privatisation policy appears
to have been conceived in a madhouse and its chances of ever providing
the nation with the modern, efficient and integrated system which we so
desperately need (as the CBI points out) is virtually nil.
This is not an eccentric or lonely position: Viscount Whitelaw holds
it; British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid is in agreement. Even Government
ministers in their innermost hearts know that rail privatisation shows
every chance of being one of the greatest industrial disasters this
country has ever seen. Nevertheless they press ahead. ScotRail can be
excused some of the opprobrium because it has been told by the
Government what it must do. Nevertheless, there was no need to try such
a dirty trick on the travelling public as the assassination by ghost of
the Fort William sleeper service. That was a home-grown abuse and the
directors of ScotRail should be ashamed of it.
Rebuffed by the courts yesterday, ScotRail regrouped quickly and
turned to what can only be described as threats. Its finance director
expressed his own sadness that the survival of the sleeper does not
remove the substantial financial implications which are implicit in it.
He believes that other services must bear the burden of finding the
financial savings which could have been secured by axeing the sleeper
service. This suggests that several thousand rail passengers will face
cuts in their services in the near future, possibly in the Edinburgh and
Fife areas and in rural districts. These can be avoided by the provision
of proper Government funding for rail services. But this Government,
driven by its need to absolve the state from responsibility for
virtually everything, is unlikely to respond positively. Where can we
turn? Highland Regional Council turned to the law in their attempt to
save the sleeper service. It is becoming an increasing function of the
justiciary in England and Scotland that it is a refuge for citizens
against the effects of the state. The Nolan Inquiry will tell the
Government how it should set standards for public life, the Scott
Inquiry will peel the dubious layer from the state's arms transactions
with Iraq, and Lord Kirkwood was preceded by the Scottish bench's
sensible refusal to let the BBC broadcast the Prime Minister immediately
before the Scottish local elections. There are dangers in all of this.
The judges may increasingly intervene to hinder the excesses of the
executive, but they are not elected officials. Thus a new can of worms
is opened; yet, in the meantime, we must simply be glad that they are
there.

MR IAN LANG has done his best: he has wriggled and fought, manoeuvred
and talked and won concessions for the Scottish interest in nuclear
power generation in the face of the Government's unseemly proposals for
hasty privatisation. He has forced a deal which is better than could
have been expected a few short weeks ago when privatisation was suddenly
sprung on us. Nevertheless he has lost the core argument. After a
statement by Mr Heseltine with more holes in in than a piece of Brussels
lace, and a counter-statement and questions of great length from Dr
Cunningham (notable principally for their rubbery quality), the defining
moment came. It was provided by an English back bencher who teased from
the President of the Board of Trade the admission that the decision to
subsume Scottish Nuclear into a holding company with the English Nuclear
Electric Company had been made in the national interest. The nation in
question is, of course, the United Kingdom. It is perfectly reasonable
to argue in some circumstances that the national interest can be defined
in this manner. To deny that possibility is to argue exclusively for
political nationalism and this we will not do. Nevertheless, the nuclear
argument is not one of these circumstances. Look no further than a
significant proportion of the Scottish business community for the firm
belief that the control of Scotland's existing nuclear electric
generating capacity should be retained in Scotland, that it should not
be merged with Nuclear Electric and, furthermore, that it could usefully
and logically acquire a couple of generating stations from England for
its own independent use.
Mr Lang and the Tories will argue that the required independence of
Scottish Nuclear has been established by the promises to create a
Scottish headquarters for the nuclear company, and that high-class job
benefits will flow into Scotland because of the subsidiary engineering
and international marketing companies. The acquisition of a ''golden
share'' by the Scottish Secretary which is intended to guarantee a veto
over the activities of the privatised company is further proof, Mr Lang
will insist, of the good intentions which lie behind the deal. Yet the
holding company will be an unwieldy monster and the prospects for
genuine competition will be diminished by the size of the privatised
company which will result. Electricity prices may well be cut, but the
Government will only gain around #3 billion for the sale of the nuclear
generators (if it is extremely lucky). This sum will equal that paid by
the taxpayer for just one modern nuclear generating station, which
hardly makes the package deal seem much of a bargain.
The sad truth of this affair is that it is driven, not by commonsense,
neither by a desire to achieve excellence, nor by the need to establish
competition: it is a political exercise in which the real interest is
not that of the nation but that of the Conservative Party. There are few
students of nuclear affairs, even among Government supporters, who doubt
that this hasty and ill-conceived privatisation has been rushed to the
top of the political agenda because of the Government's need to gather
revenue to finance pre-election tax cuts. This is not cynicism; it is a
self-evident truth, and in the process of accomplishing it any number of
important interests have been cast to the wind. The staff of Scottish
Nuclear, who appear bound, gagged, and shackled, may doubt whether even
the current deal could have been achieved without their principled
opposition. They may want to take that opposition further but they
should not be seduced by the lure and the promises of the golden share.
If past experience is a guide it will be found to consist of the
cheapest tin.

AMONG the items which go to make up style, the dress is fashion's
truest piece of artistry, and so, its sternest test. Balenciaga could
create such a masterpiece using no more than half a dozen seams, and the
great Spanish designer knew that the best dress is one which can stand
alone, a faultless silhouette free of any accessory distraction.
This spring the dress is at its most elemental, a slip of a thing born
of the cult for bringing lingerie into the open, but sometimes so purely
simple there is an innocence about it. We should not be fooled, however,
for here is often a cool frock with a sensuous edge; a dress that pays
slip service to the camisole and the corset and all the other underworld
affiliates.
Roll-necked perhaps and sleeveless, or hanging by a halter or two
spaghetti straps, this slip arrives as a slender memory of the heyday
chic of Jackie O. In pale, plain fabrics and the slitheriest of satin it
might seem destined only for the dancing hours, but many designers
encourage its daytime presence, although there are hazards in this.
Caught in a rainstorm at the bus stop, the silky slip looks sluttish,
one of Liz Taylor's cast-offs from Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, or the crushed
mantle of Blanche Dubois. Yet sprouting meadow flowers and garden
blossoms and flaring out slightly from the hip to flutter on the shins,
the slip dress evokes a different picture; one of almost maidenly
wholesomeness, underpinned with a pastel T-shirt, sandshoes and prim
white ankle socks.
But on the wider scene the mood for dresses is no timid revival, no
prissy return to the quiet little numbers once worn by Pinewood
starlets. This dress age is one of curvaceous glory and independent
spirit, just the thing for a generation who grew up in the toxic
sameness of sweatshirts and jeans.
For many it offers a first opportunity to wear a garment of
undisguised femininity because in its idle way the leisure ethos killed
off graceful clothes by proclaiming the shellsuit as a stylistic role
model of the time. That hapless condition wasn't helped either by the
alternative, the business suit which when worn at night merely created a
never-off-duty sort of look, and in good weather appeared incongruous,
heavy as an ungainly filing cabinet.
So the pull towards the slip dress arrives at a time when women are
bored by the throw-on ease of denim, the tedium of blazers with matching
skirts, and the lurid schlock of nylon. Instead, the designs which are
luring them towards the cash desks are inspired by the seductive dress
visions of some of the hottest talents in international fashion: Miuccia
Prada , Jil Sander, Calvin Klein, Issey Miyake, John Galliano, and Donna
Karan.
While other designers might have despaired of ever again being able to
prise women free of baggy sweaters and leggings, these are the stars
triumphantly leading the dress movement which now dominates the high
street.
And as a result, more of us are discovering that to buy a significant
dress is to become involved in a memorable relationship. A woman may
never remember the style and colour of her first set of separates but
she will never forget the cut and shade of her first dress. A dress then
is like a flag, signalling an important occasion and, before buying, it
needs to be contemplated from every angle. After all, in a dress a woman
is obviously going places, and this year it is nearly always the slip
which points her in the right direction.

* WORLD Wars and subsequent conflicts have resulted in a high and
increasing waiting list for injured soldiers needing long-term care. So
much so that a group of 11 students at Langside College, Glasgow, have
organised ''An Evening of Fashion'' which will take place at The Central
Hotel tomorrow night. The event is in aid of Erskine Hospital to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of VE Day.
Since Erskine was founded in 1916, over 50,000 men and women,
including ex-National Servicemen have been cared for.
The HND students will be acting as models, parading clothes which
include casual and menswear, Asian and bridal wear and a sneak preview
of fashions from the new Pepe range. They chose all the clothes
themselves.
The Langside College Fashion Show will take place in The Logie Baird
Suite at Central Hotel. It starts at 7.30pm. Ticket price: #5. For

FANCY a night at the movies next week? A night with several
differences? There is a strong argument that the screening of
large-scale, classic, silent films with live orchestral accompaniment
has been one of the grand successes of the current season at Glasgow's
Royal Concert Hall.
First there was the biblical epic Ben Hur from 1925, with a scale of
casting and effects that was genuinely staggering. Then came Flesh and
the Devil, the 1926 melodrama in which John Gilbert and Greta Garbo
positively smouldered.
And -- coming soon to a concert hall near you -- next week Douglas
Fairbanks Snr will buckle his swash, mount his magic carpet, and fly
into action in the stunning 1924 marathon version of The Thief of
Bagdad. And all to the opulent accompaniment of the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra at the foot of the screen. Who needs SurroundSound?
When I call the events a grand success, I don't mean simply success in
box-office terms: the two to date have not been sell-outs, though they
have both been well-attended -- 1200 for Ben Hur, 1600 for Flesh and the
Devil. But they have been genuine artistic successes demonstrating that,
whatever else is staged there -- from conference to pop concert --
Glasgow's big hall transforms itself appropriately and atmospherically
into a huge movie house.
And the key to that success -- the intrinsic value of the films apart
-- has been the scrupulously crafted and stylish music created for them
by American-born Carl Davis, the doyen of film composers. Generating
music for silent films seems to be in vogue -- there have been numerous
other projects this season throughout Scotland. But Davis has fashioned
an art and an industry all his own to Hollywood epics.
It's 15 years since he got started, in a big way, on that side of the
business. And that was with the legendary screening -- with Davis's
orchestral music all the way -- of Abel Gance's five-hour epic,
Napoleon, commissioned from Thames Television by Channel 4. On the night
of that premiere, Jeremy Isaacs, then still with Thames, went backstage
immediately after the screening and commissioned from Davis a whole
series of scores for films that became known as the Thames Silents, and
which have subsequently been seen (and heard) all over the world.
Davis's scores, which demonstrate an extraordinary expertise at
pastiche -- his brilliant stylistic borrowings go way beyond mere
imitative art -- don't always come off in a concert hall context, but,
allied to the film for which they were conceived, they have a stunning
and unforgettable impact.
His hugely effective score for The Thief of Bagdad is striking in that
it uses, liberally and often exactly, the score of Rimsky-Korsakov's
Scheherazade (along with other music by the master colourist and Davis's
own original composition). Rimsky's glittering symphonic poem is the
composition that remains, to this day, the quintessential Romantic
musical image of orientalism and exoticism. It's also a highly
appropriate choice in that some of the design elements in the film
itself -- including Fairbanks Snr's costume -- were influenced by the
Bakst designs for Diaghilev's ballet of Rimsky's orchestral masterpiece.
Davis has said that his intention was ''to create a score as close as
possible to that which Rimsky-Korsakov might have written''. He said
that, in sitting down to create that score, he had tried to imagine
''not only that Rimsky-Korsakov was still composing, but that he was
also writing music for the movies''.
The film itself is a stunner. Rumoured to be the most expensive movie
of the period, it was very much a Douglas Fairbanks Snr enterprise. Not
only did he star in it, he wrote it, produced it, and was his own stunt
man. He also hired the director and did the casting (which included
dancers from Java, China and Japan, and 2500 Mexican extras, bussed out
each day of the shoot from Los Angeles).
And he hired William Cameron Menzies as art director. Some of Menzies'
spectacular designs and his solutions to technical problems --
underwater scenes, a city suspended in space, the flying carpet, and a
dragon (for which he eschewed papier mache and used a real crocodile)
became standard techniques in Hollywood.
The opening night of The Thief of Bagdad, at New York's Liberty
Theatre in 1924, was itself a spectacular occasion, with the hall decked
out with oriental paintings, tapestries, rugs and silks, incense wafting
through the auditorium, and ushers, dressed in Arabian garb, serving
Turkish coffee.
Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall perhaps won't rise to those heights for
next week's screening; but then the Liberty Theatre didn't have Carl
Davis, his music, and the Royal SNO, did it?

7.30pm

THE dramatic fruits of a Scottish-Singaporean collaboration will be on
display tonight at 7.30pm at Strathclyde Arts Centre in Washington
Street. The centre's own Icon Theatre Company have jointly devised a
show with the Necessary Stage Company of Singapore, under the authorship
of Haresh Sharma.
The finished product will be an embodiment of the shared cultural
links which unite peoples around the world.
Theatre Cryptic's Child Lover is a play exploring the life of Annie
and Daniel at the Tramway at 9pm. After 15 happy years together, they
yearn in vain for the patter of tiny feet around their marital abode.
Annie decides to embark upon a course of action which will result in a
desperate, frightening and unforeseen outcome. What price an end to her
childless state?
Also at the Tramway, at 9.45pm, you can experience the experimental,
mixed-media collaborative work which is Nation. It's billed as a
performance, an installation, and a sound-piece, and of course it
features the mandatory live Internet hook-up with some wild-eyed piper
or other at the gates of the information superhighway.
The pre-publicity material which we journos have been given is
distinguished by its inventive use of swearie-words. Furthermore, we are
assured that Nation rejects such bourgeois conceits as narrative,
instead opting to present each collaborator as ''an autonomous system
exploring personalised rituals and the general human condition.''
To which statement one can only cock an eyebrow and say, in
time-honoured Glaswegian fashion: Is that right, pal?

DETERMINED to blur the boundaries twixt the arts -- and probably
mindful of Glasgow's City of Architecture and Design status in 1999 --
the ever-resourceful Transmission Gallery has mounted a convivial,
social compilation of art and design, music and video, wall drawings,
magazines, architectural models and hi-tech sculpture.
You can sit on Susie Hunter's delicious fluorescent, Lycra-covered
styrene stools to read magazines, or get coffee at Andrew Miler's
Breakfast Bar. DJs Wilkes &amp; McChlery have compiled and pressed a one-off
CD of ambient dance as soundtrack for the show, while Eva Grubinger
shows an ambiguous piece called Coffee Break.
The show's title is taken from a short story by William Gibson, on
sale with Paul Maguire's clever computer-generated virtual sculpture
video, Iain Sinclair's Flashcard torches, (#4.99 and nominated for
1994's British Design Awards), plus Andrea Zittel's Transcript at 3.
Doubtless Ron Arad's amazing mirror-laminate stainless steel Cartier
Foundation table, or Linn's hi-fi cost a bit more, but the notion of
accessibility is established nonetheless.
I especially like the wall drawings. Martin Boyce catches fifties
Ideal Home aesthetics to a T, while Andrew Megaw gives us a linear
cassette. Vicky Morton uses traditional oil for her painting, Ned, while
Transmission mixes top names with locals and post-graduates.
Excellent stuff.

THE Royal SNO and Scottish Chamber Orchestra yesterday announced a
two-week festival of American music that will be staged as a unique
collaborative project.
The festival -- dubbed ''I Like to be in America'' -- will be held in
Glasgow in February next year. The core of the festival will be six
orchestral concerts -- three from each orchestra -- staged in Glasgow
Royal Concert Hall.
American conductor and pianist Andrew Litton -- music director of the
Dallas Symphony Orchestra -- has been appointed music director of the
festival and will conduct both orchestras in three of the six concerts.
All the other conductors and most of the soloists will be American.
The range of repertoire suggests a comprehensive survey of American
music, basically in four categories. There will be established American
classics, from Barber's Adagio to Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man
and Appalachian Spring.
There will be popular and populist music: Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue
(in the original jazz band version), Porgy and Bess Suite, dances from
Bernstein's On the Town and West Side Story. There will be music from
Broadway: a night of music by Jerome Kern and Cole Porter, with
conductor John McGlinn and soprano Kim Criswell, both figures associated
with Broadway performance.
And there will be contemporary American orchestral music, with
European premieres of works by Caltabiano and the United States' leading
female composer, Ellen Zwilich.
A fully detailed launch of the festival will be held in the autumn, by
which time it will have been expanded to embrace additional associated
events. These are likely to include an American musical at the King's
Theatre, a concert by the Paragon Ensemble, an exhibition of the designs
of architect Frank Lloyd Wright (to be staged at the royal concert hall)
and a film season -- possibly of American musicals -- at the GFT.

THE afternoon sun encourages us to be laid back. So we loll, and
half-joke about the cost of keeping art -- though not necessarily
artists -- alive. Did I know there's no cultural embargo on work coming
from the former Yugoslavia? The sun beams. There is, however, an
economic embargo. A cloud appears on the horizon. The artists, it seems,
are truly free -- they can't be paid for appearing over here. So why
have the three people before me made this trip to Glasgow? The answer is
-- to be part of the emerging Nation.
A few yards away, inside the chillier reaches of Tramway's vast
workshop space, a steady trickle of equipment is mounting up. Bits and
pieces of a sophisticated sound system. Projectors. Monitors. Something
that looks like a small, domestic crane trundles past. It will take
hours, maybe days, to rig the space for Nation, an experimental
collaboration that spans different methods of communication and
different languages.
Sonja expresses herself through dance. Along with members of Groupe
SKART -- whose on-going art attack employs poster design, radio
broadcasting and gallery performances -- she has travelled from Belgrade
to join forces with a carefully recruited team of Glasgow practitioners
whose artistic skills range from composing music to computer images.
What they all share is a kind of driven curiosity: they all want to push
barriers aside, whether between forms or cultures.
The flesh-and-blood interface -- he who connects the various
contributors -- is Marc J. Hawker. Some months back Hawker came into
contact with the underground art movement in Belgrade.
Essentially, what he witnessed was art in a state of attrition. With
the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the fragmentation of so many
commonplace structures, artists were forced to question their existence
in very specific ways. To stay or go was, for many, the crucial
question. Not merely in terms of staying alive, but in terms of staying
creative. When Hawker returned to Glasgow 0 he decided to import some of
the resourcefulness, energy and subversive grit of that Belgrade
community. En masse, they would imagine a non-terrestrial territory
where different points of artistic view, different cultural backgrounds,
different technologies could meet and co-exist. And wherever the
collaborators were gathered that would be Nation.
For audiences entering the Nation zone during Mayfest, the main
requirement is an open mind. The space itself has become a melting pot
for various forms of thought and expression. There will be live input
from Internet conversations, video projections, text-based material,
dance, sound-scapes and simultaneous performance. The air will be thick
with clustered images of territory: possession, oppression, surrender,
and guilt. Choose what you see, choose what you think, but make an
effort to choose -- because that is your ultimate freedom.
* Studio Map presents Nation at The Tramway from tonight until Sunday
May 14. Performances start 9.45pm.

EIGHTY-five years to the day after the Great Lafayette burned to death
on the stage of the old Empire, Soft Bodies Hard Metal Physical Theatre
Company tempts fate by getting the whole audience up there with it.
In a weird reversal, the curtain comes down on an empty auditorium and
the show begins. It says something about the dimensions of this venue
when its stage alone can accommodate the equivalent of a sizeable studio
theatre, and all praise for doing it. Large-scale performance is nothing
without the pulse of the intimate and experimental feeding into it.
Selling point for tonight's show, a three-strong dance piece based on
a John Keats poem, is the Rotosphere, a cross between a gyroscope and a
funfair ride that allows performers with and without disabilities to
move with equal fluidity. This 6ft-high structure has the mesmerising
fascination of an executive toy, its controlled turns and loops giving
it a placating equilibrium, though its passengers are both liberated and
ensnared.
But the Rotosphere is not the real star of Stephen Hooper's show. Nor
is the story, the subtleties of which passed me by. No, it's the tightly
defined concentration of the performers, the precision of the
choreography, and Barry Ganberg's abrasive soundtrack that makes it
something special.
In the first half especially it is as though Evelyn Neave, Peter
Titus, and Craig McKnight are stepping their way through a series of
still-photographic images, Neave adding to the effect with the
impenetrable look of a long-exposure portrait. Her command of a
conventional wheelchair is as graceful as it is razor-sharp, while the
choreography goes briskly from confrontation to comedy to tenderness.
Well worth catching when it transfers to Glasgow's RSAMD this weekend.

NEVER judge by appearances. That admitted, last night's crowd looked
the type to which Robyn Hitchcock has become accustomed during his
stop-go 15-year solo career.
Impoverished students eking out one pint of Guinness over three hours.
Close-cropped criminal recidivists with prison tans. An elderly and
professorial type tamping Golden Old Navy Shag into his Meerschaum and
puffing reflectively.
When Robyn ambled out, he resembled Paul Merton's elder brother, ie
blokeish and quotidian. Deceptive, that. Even if you were to judge him
solely by his intros to his songs, and not his songs themselves, Robyn
Hitchcock is surpassing strange. Elliptical, his intros are. And
oblique.
How did Robyn tee up one song? By saying it was about the tiny
marshmallows that reproduce inside your TV set, and whenever you ring
the police to complain, it's always a marshmallow that answers the
phone.
He said another song was about being menaced by solid objects like
wardrobes. This may have been a metaphor. For something. Or not.
My favourite intro -- a long, detailed one -- introduced a song about
an artist who lived in a white tower with no downstairs, and he was
stung by a wasp-woman, but then Robyn admitted that none of this was
actually mentioned in the song.
And the songs? Unlike the intros, they're compact and pithy. Funnily
brilliant, too, sporting dry lines like: ''I remember everything as if
it happened years ago.'' Deadlines forced me to leave early, during My
Wife And My Dead Wife.
A couple at the back sang along, word-perfect. She looked 18. He could
have been 70. Apt; surreal; Hitchcockian.

A CAST-IRON guarantee for Scotland was Michael Heseltine's description
in the House of Commons yesterday. He was announcing the Government's
decisions on the arrangements for privatising Britain's modern nuclear
electricity generating stations.
The privatisation, which will take place next year, is a really good
deal for Scotland. Readers of this and other newspapers over the past
couple of weeks could be forgiven for fearing that the opposite would be
true. But nothing could be more stark than the contrast between the
fears and rumours reported in the media and the facts on the matter.
Far from leading to the decline and disappearance of an important
industry in Scotland, it secures for it a bright long-term future, freed
from control from Whitehall and freed from the financial constraints of
the public sector.
Far from leading to a loss of control in Scotland, it brings a major
new company headquarters to Scotland.
Far from leading to a reduction on jobs, it increases Scottish
employment, and it will bring over 100 high-quality jobs to Scotland.
Far from losing its identity by merging with its larger English
counterpart, Scottish Nuclear's existence as a separate entity will be
wholly preserved and guaranteed in the long term. It will continue to
have the same functions as it now has.
''Paper promises'' is the immediate charge. But three mechanisms will
ensure that the benefit to Scotland will be long-term. First, the new
headquarters operations, including key group functions, will be
established well before privatisation. Second, its structure and
functions will be clearly written in to its Memorandum and Articles of
Assocation. Third, I will hold a special share in the holding company,
unlimited in its duration, linked to the key provisions in the
Memorandum of Articles, along with the President of the Board of Trade.
I will also hold a special share in SNL. The way in which these three
mechanisms interlock will provide assurance that the new arrangements
are not temporary. This will be a triple lock on the cast-iron
guarantee.
Once our critics tire of suggesting that Scotland somehow cannot hold
on merit the headquarters of one of the UK's largest companies, you will
hear them try to raise fears about safety. But the nuclear generators in
this country have an excellent safety record. Safety will always be of
paramount importance to the Government and the industry.
That is why the independent, public regulatory system will apply with
equal rigour to the privatised industry. The Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate has been fully consulted about the options and timetable
for privatisation to ensure that our decisions do not conflict with the
need to maintain the highest safety standards.
Of course we looked at privatising SNL on its own. But the clear and
unequivocal advice we received from our advisers was that this might not
be achievable and would produce a very vulnerable company. We have also
received firm assurances from our advisers that the structure we are now
proceeding with is sound and commercially based and will secure a
successful privatised industry.
We also announced yesterday that the same improved efficiency in the
nuclear industry which makes privatisation possible will allow us to
reduce electricity prices next year. Electricity prices are already
falling in real terms in Scotland, and prices to domestic consumers will
fall faster as a result of our announcement.
Scottish franchise consumers will end up with an overall fall of 8% in
real terms when we bring forward the end of the nuclear premium which
they pay at present. This is the same order of benefit as consumers in
England and Wales will receive next year when the separate nuclear levy
is ended there. But Scottish domestic consumers will be ahead because
they have already started to receive part of the benefit of a reduced
nuclear premium. And anyway our prices are lower.
A good deal for Scotland, a good deal for Scottish Nuclear, a good
deal for Scottish consumers. A lasting deal for everyone, as befits an
industry used to looking 10 or 20 years ahead.

YOU might call it the Bactrian solution. Scottish Nuclear fought a
shrewdly energetic campaign to be privatised as an independent company.
Nuclear Electric, even more of an enthusiast for pastures private,
argued for a pre-privatisation merger, which it expected to dominate.
When President of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine stood up in the
Commons yesterday to announce the much-leaked final solution, it was to
confirm that the nuclear camel which goes to public auction next year
will have two distinct humps -- one consisting of Scottish Nuclear's AGR
operations, the other made up of Nuclear Electric's five AGRs plus the
new Sizewell B pressurised water reactor.
Both humps and the camel's principal place of residence in future --
Scotland -- are insured in perpetuity (or at least for 10 years) through
a web of golden shares, letters of intent, and the beast's own written
pedigree. Additional keepers, an estimated 125 of them, are to be moved
north to look after it. Perhaps the most pleasing outcome for the
ministers who hammered it out is that, being a camel, albeit a nuclear
one, the merged creature will no longer require any sustenance from any
publicly-owned oasis.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang regards the outcome as a personal triumph,
involving not one, but three inward investments to Scotland. Not only is
Scotland to get the corporate group headquarters of the new merged
(British Nuclear?) company, involving up to 40 jobs. We are also to get
the headquarters of that merged company's overseas marketing arm. And an
engineering support unit for Scottish Nuclear's Hunterston B and Torness
stations, and for their sister plants in England, Hinkley Point B and
Heysham 2.
Lang's officials confess private amazement at how many concessions the
boss managed to wring out of the Department of Trade and Industry and
Nuclear Electric, when he went to the table with so few cards to play in
the first place. ''I can't remember Willie Ross getting a better deal
when he had a lot more cards up his sleeve,'' said one.
''Guarded welcome'' is perhaps the best way to sum up feelings on the
executive floor at Scottish Nuclear's Peel Park headquarters in East
Kilbride. The team there, led by chairman James Hann and chief executive
Dr Robin Jeffrey, believed they could make privatisation work on their
own. But they have bowed to the politically inevitable. Their position
was neatly summed up in the heading to their main press release:
''Scottish Nuclear welcomes decision if it secures future jobs in
Scotland.''
That if remains a big if. The solution struck by Lang, Heseltine, and
the rest of the Cabinet appears to square some pressing political
circles. It allows the Scottish Secretary to claim a prime role for
Scotland in the future of the nuclear industry. And it allows the
Government to minimise regulatory delays and sell the modern part of the
civil nuclear power in one piece, for the fattest price it is likely to
get, in time for pre-election tax cuts in 1996.
It also carries the bonus of reduced electricity prices for consumers,
through the early ending of the nuclear levy in England and Wales and
the accelerated phasing out of the nuclear energy price subsidy in
Scotland -- another useful pre-election ploy to try and wipe out the
electorate's resentment at paying 8% VAT on domestic fuel bills.
But, no matter how politically adroit, the chosen solution still looks
commercially clumsy. Scottish Nuclear's ongoing operations are to be
ring-fenced through a special share in the hands of the Scottish
Secretary and a subsidiary SN board. The Nuclear Electric operating
subsidiary is to have its identity reinforced by an equivalent special
share in the hands of the Board of Trade President.
The location of the new holding company headquarters in Scotland is to
be similarly nailed down by a third golden share, jointly held by Lang
and Heseltine or their successors, which means their approval is
required when the chairmanship of the merged company changes hands. The
new group board will also be required to underline the Scottish location
for the HQ in the privatisation prospectus and through a letter of
intent to shareholders.
Such devices -- designed to stop any rats getting at the guarantees,
was one insider's graphic description -- have failed to cut any ice with
the opposition parties, already chorusing the familiar list of past
broken pledges of that sort -- Guinness/Distillers; TSB; Britoil; and
the like. But the guarantees raise three other pressing issues.
First, signs of recent tensions between Scottish Nuclear and its
would-be predator, Nuclear Electric, were still erupting yesterday. In
its press release welcoming the Government's announcement, Nuclear
Electric confidently asserted the new group headquarters would be based
in Edinburgh. Both the Scottish Office and Scottish Nuclear would only
specify Scotland and sources close to Mr Lang said the precise location
should be a matter for the new group board.
In fact, Scottish Nuclear is determined to fight for the group
headquarters to be located in the same handsome offices in East Kilbride
currently occupied by Scottish Nuclear. ''A twenty-first century office
for a twenty-first century company,'' said one executive. I doubt
Nuclear Electric will have anything to do with that kind of thinking.
Second, the new holding company is to have an outside chairman --
''Scottish based'' or ''with strong Scottish links'' depending on whose
version of the outcome you listened to yesterday. And it is almost
certain that the new group chief executive will be recruited from
outwith the two existing companies too. But that could mean trying to
float a company in a sector which just six years ago proved unsellable,
with two nuclear novices at the helm.
And that raises the third pressing issue. They will be running a group
with two ring-fenced operating subsidiaries, which will incorporate
duplication of functions and excess cost. If they want to merge the
marketing department or the press and PR departments, they will
presumably have to ask ministers to wave their golden shares in
approval.
Although the Government claims it has from its City advisers, BZW, a
letter of comfort on that point, claiming that the chosen structure is
both ''credible and workable'' I doubt every potential investor will
agree. And it is precisely in that area of administrative cost saving,
in which both SN and NE have been heavily involved up till now, that
jobs could eventually be lost which could take the shine of Ian Lang's
inward investment coup in years to come.
After all, those bits of yesterday's White Paper which did not centre
on the privatisation proposals hardly made pleasing reading for those,
like the British Nuclear Industry Forum, who have been campaigning to
rehabilitate nuclear's public profile and position the fuel source as a
key ingredient in a balanced energy policy of the future, capable of
reducing the gas emissions which contribute to global warming.
In these passages of the White Paper, the Government says that, in
current market conditions, a new nuclear station is unlikely to provide
the rate of return of a gas-fired station. It explicitly rejects the
argument that new nuclear capacity is needed to reduce the UK's CO2
emissions. And it poo-poos the suggestion that new nuclear investment is
needed to create jobs and add to Britain's export strength. ''There
appears to be no clear commercial case for new nuclear power stations in
the UK in current circumstances,'' it concludes.
That tone has angered some senior nuclear industry figures. ''The
White Paper could have been written by Greenpeace,'' said one.
If ministers are saying they can see no case for new investment in
nuclear capacity in the next 20 years, that implies they are selling a
shrinking industry. If it is shrinking it will have to look to its cost
base. And the first thing it will look at is the cumbersome
superstructure it was kitted out with yesterday. If you believe the
golden shares will survive that kind of scrutiny, you have more faith in
political integrity than I have.

THE nuclear privatisation political battle in Scotland will centre on
the golden share powers of the Scottish Secretary.
During the Cabinet committee discussions on the nuclear review,
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang reminded his colleagues that assurances to
Scotland in previous industrial mergers which were not then kept was a
sore point which could be politically damaging.
One option of adding the two northern reactors at Heysham to Scottish
Nuclear's two in order to create a couple of medium-sized companies for
privatisation was stymied by the length of time a reinspection of what
would be two new companies would take -- too long, probably, to enable
privatisation to take place next summer.
The ministerial committee also appears to have felt that Scottish
Nuclear, though considerably improving its performance, was in not quite
a brilliant state as its pre-audit profit appeared to demonstrate. Some
four-fifths of the #150m came from premiums payable under the nuclear
levy agreement.
The possible decommissioning costs of its older reactor at Hunterston
and the fact that its contract to supply energy to Scottish Power and
Hydro Electric under controlled terms ends in 2005, together with the
smaller size of its operation which would leave it open to predatory
bids, seem to have been factors influencing Ministers to go for a single
company solution.
It was then up to Mr Lang to argue against a simple merger in which
Scottish Nuclear would have been swallowed up by the larger Nuclear
Electric.
Successful in this, he secured a golden share in perpetuity which, he
will argue, will enable him to veto any attempt by a private owner to
move all of the Scottish-based holding company but the brass plate on
the door out of Scotland.
The Opposition parties feel that it will still be possible for the
private owners to so manage their affairs or take advantage of
circumstances that it would be difficult for Ministers to exercise the
power the share gives them. That debate will be fought out over the next
year.
Over the UK as a whole, the Opposition will claim that the vital
safety record of the industry under public control could be at risk.
Ministers will reply that safety regulations will be just as stringent
for the private owners. Staffing has been reviewed by both subsidiary
companies and, even if further job losses are not directly related to
this privatisation, the Opposition are not likely to make the
distinction.
Whether Labour can repeat the success of its campaign against the
proposed sell-off of Royal Mail looks doubtful. Fears about safety would
seem to offer the best chance of building the public support which might
frighten enough Tory MPs into telling Ministers that nuclear
privatisation could be a political liability.
That the taxpayer will ultimately be footing the bill for eventual
decommissionings without the help of profits from the current industry
is a sound enough point but the timescale appears rather too long for it
to have an urgent impact on the electors.
Presentationally, Mr Lang can be reckoned to have done a good job,
which has at least helped in bringing along some of his back-bench
colleagues who were making unhappy noises at the prospect of Scottish
Nuclear being simply absorbed by Nuclear Electric. The power or
otherwise of the golden share is unlikely to be demonstrated in the very
short period likely to elapse between privatisation and the next General
Election.
Ministers appear confident that the necessary inspection procedures
can be completed within a year to 14 months, although any slippage of
that estimate would cast doubts on a sale in time to put #3 billion or
so into the Chancellor's coffers for the positively last Budget before
the election.

THE 93-page White Paper The Prospects for Nuclear Power in the UK
devotes only one short chapter to the Government's privatisation
proposals and another, even shorter one, to the plan to phase out the
fossil fuel (nuclear) levy and the equivalent Scottish price subsidy
arrangements two years earlier than planned.
Much of the White Paper is devoted to analysing the commercial case
for new nuclear power station capacity in the UK. The Government's
principal conclusion is that providing public sector support for a new
nuclear power station ''would constitute a significant intervention in
the electricity market and that current and forseeable circumstances do
not warrant such an intervention''.
The Government reviews the case for such investment in terms of
environmental benefits (lower CO2 emissions, contributing to global
warming); diversity and security of supply; and industrial
considerations, including the preservation of key engineering skills and
the export potential of the technology.
But it emerges from the White Paper, it is unconvinced on any of these
grounds that it should intervene in the market. Instead it encourages
private sector operators to investigate the construction of new nuclear
power stations on a fully commercial basis.
It is hard to see where they will get the confidence to do that from,
given the comparative analysis of future gas-fired and nuclear
investment contained in the White Paper. The best nuclear option, it
concedes, is Sizewell C, Nuclear Electric's plan for twin pressurised
water reactors to sit alongside the recently operational Sizewell B on
the Suffolk coast.
But when the Government's advisers, BZW, compared another PWR with a
combined cycle gas turbine station, the staple generating plant of the
recent dash-for-gas in the UK electricity market, the numbers appear to
favour gas.
''On the basis of the evidence presented to the review, the Government
concludes that it is unlikely in current market conditions and at
current gas prices that Sizewell C can provide a rate of return
competitive with the main alternative, a CCGT station,'' it says.
On creating a diversity of generating sources through a sustainable
integrated energy policy -- a favourite theme of Scottish Nuclear
chairman James Hann -- the White Paper is again dismissive. ''The
nuclear review has revealed no compelling reasons for supposing that the
market will not of its own accord provide an appropriate level of
diversity,'' it states.
The Government concedes that no new build in current circumstances may
lead to ''first-of-a-kind'' costs if new nuclear capacity is required
later. But it insists the technology will not be lost in the meantime.
It says it is not clear that new build now ''would do anything to
enhance export opportunities''. And it dismissed arguments that a hiatus
in the station-building programme will undermine technology spin-off.
''There is little technology that the nuclear industry is uniquely
qualified to provide to other markets,'' it argues.
''The Government believes the long-term interests of the UK energy
sector are best served by the development of free markets for energy
within the EU,'' it goes on. ''To support the construction of new
nuclear power plant on grounds of a possible boost to economic activity
and the generation of higher overall employment would not be in the best
interests of either electricity consumers or the taxpayer.''

New Delhi, Tuesday
IRATE Indian MPs called for a broadcast ban on Rupert Murdoch's Star
TV today as the furore mounted over a disparaging reference to Mahatma
Gandhi on a saucy television talk show.
Parliament erupted over a remark made on the Hong Kong-based
television network's new chat show Nikki Tonight beamed to dozens of
Asian countries.
Well-known provocateur and homosexual-rights activist Ashok Row-Kavi
triggered the row when he told the show's host, Nikki Bedi, that he once
lost a job for calling Mahatma Gandhi a ''bastard''.
Gandhi is called Father of the Nation for the crucial role he played
in helping India win independence in 1947 and still enjoys god-like
respect.
The apostle of non-violence was shot by a Hindu fanatic 5[1/2] months
after independence.
Mahatma Gandhi's great grandson, Tushar Gandhi, said he would sue Star
TV, the show's producer TV 18, Bedi and Row-Kavi for #10m for
defamation.
Tushar Gandhi heard Row-Kavi's quip, which apparently amused Bedi, as
he was switching channels.
A Star TV spokeswoman in Hong Kong denied an Indian newspaper report
that Nikki Tonight had been axed but said the broadcaster was
investigating the incident.
''We very much regret any offence that was caused,'' the spokeswoman
said.
''Mr Row-Kavi's comments have been a matter of public record for 15
years,'' she said. ''They don't reflect the views of the programme host
Nikki or the views of Star.''
Nikki Bedi, who was raised in Britain and moved to India seven years
ago, makes no bones about her aims. ''We are here to have fun and not
hammer people on their beliefs or politics,'' she said.
She is the second rising woman personality to face wrath for
overstepping the mark in India's male-driven society.

The Hague, Tuesday
ROBOT milkmaids are making it possible for clever Dutch cows to choose
when they are milked.
Bovine brain and computer brain work together to let a cow who feels
the urge take the initiative in the milking shed, said the system's
inventors today.
''For most cows, after training them several times they are used to
the system,'' said a spokesman for the Prolion company. ''There are, of
course, some limits. Some cows just don't get it.''
Those who do have computer chips affixed to collars which record their
last milking.
The cows are trained to approach a milking pen when their udders are
full.
To make the milking pen even more attractive they are given a
sweetened feed that they just cannot resist. A computer reads the chip
and decides if it's indeed that time again.
If it is the gate opens, the cow enters the stall and a robot
approaches using ultrasound to locate the teats, wash them and attach
vacuum milking hoses to the udder.
The Dutch Prolion firm claims its Liberty system can cut labour costs
and increase milk production by 15%, allowing for round-the-clock
milking.
The robot tries five times to connect the cow to the vacuum hoses. If
it fails, the cow is let out of the milking pen, and the farmer beeped.
But the robot milker does not come cheap, even in a land with five
million cows, one for every three people.
Prices begin at #100,000 for a one-stall set-up and climb to #260,000
for the maximum three-stall unit.
The reception down on the farm has been mixed.
''Some farmers are very reluctant to buy the machine because there are
still many technical problems,'' admitted Atze Schaap of the Dutch
Agriculture Board.--AP.

Manila, Tuesday
PHILIPPINE President Fidel Ramos claimed a fresh mandate today as his
ruling coalition headed for a near clean-sweep of senatorial elections,
but bitter fights for local posts kept the death toll mounting.
The bloodiest incident occurred in Talipao on southern Jolo Island
where 17 people have died in two days of fighting between marines and
200 followers of Muslim mayor Khan Tulawi who have barricaded roads
leading to the town, police said.
They said six marines were killed in a mortar attack yesterday and 11
supporters of Tulawi died today in air strikes by five government
gunships and a bomber.
The casualties brought to more than 80 the death toll in political
violence since campaigning began in January. More than 50 of the deaths
occurred in the past three days.
In northern Cagayan province, gunmen killed seven followers of a vice
mayor in an ambush and one civilian was killed and scores wounded when a
grenade exploded at a school in southern Buluan town while votes were
being counted.
In nearby Batangas province, a female schoolteacher was shot dead by a
man trying to snatch a ballot box in her care.
Ramos, who won the 1992 presidential elections with only 23.5% of the
popular vote, has said yesterday's vote was a referendum on his
three-year-old administration.
''This is a fresh mandate. This now broadens our base of popular
support,'' Ramos said as partial returns from yesterday's polls gave his
coalition a 10-2 edge in the fight for the 12 seats being contested in
the 24-member Senate.
''We have a message for our investor friends. Stay with us, the
Philippines. The best is yet to come,'' he told supporters.
If the trend holds in the laborious manual vote-counting, which could
take weeks, Ramos would have a powerful hold on both houses of the
Congress.
Ramos said he expected the coalition to win 156 of the 204 House of
Representatives seats being contested and 56 of the 76 gubernatorial
races.
''President Ramos has passed the referendum with flying colours,''
Herman Montenegro, former president of the Philippine Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, told Reuters.
''It is a significant boost for him and the perception that he is
doing a good job,'' he said.
''A 9-3 result is acceptable for the government. A 10-2 result would
be most impressive for Ramos,'' Alex Magno, a political-science
professor at the University of the Philippines, said in an interview.
With more than one million of the estimated 27 million votes counted,
the only opposition candidate with a firm hold on her seat in the Senate
is Miriam Defensor-Santiago, an anti-graft crusader who lost to Ramos in
the 1992 presidential race.
Ferdinand Marcos, Jnr, the son of the late Philippine dictator,
appeared in danger of losing his bid for a place in the Senate.
Cashiered army colonel Gregorio Honasan, who led bloody coup attempts
in 1987 and 1989 that plunged the Philippines into a savage economic
recession, was also struggling to win.
But former first lady Imelda Marcos, widow of the ousted president,
appears headed for a political comeback as partial returns show her
winning in the congressional race in her home province of Leyte.
She won a legal battle today when the Philippines' poll body lifted
its previous order disqualifying her from the race.
The Commission on Election (Comelec), reversing itself, said there
were not enough grounds to block her proclamation if the current voting
trend showing her as winning the race for the congressional seat of her
home province of Leyte was maintained.
Partial, unofficial returns showed the widow of the late president
Ferdinand Marcos leading incumbent Cirilo Montejo by 44,160 votes to
19,114.
Comelec had used a technicality to disqualify Marcos before the polls,
saying she failed to meet the requirement of one-year residence in
Leyte, 370 miles south of Manila.
Marcos, 65, listed seven months' residence in her candidacy papers.
She later said it was an ''honest mistake'' by her secretary.
She is also fighting an appeal against an 18-year jail sentence for
corruption imposed on her by an anti-graft court in 1993.
She also faces dozens of other criminal cases for allegedly helping
her husband loot the economy during his 20-year rule.
Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in a 1986 popular revolt and died three
years later in exile in Hawaii.--Reuter.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
UNITED Nations peacekeepers said today they could not protect Sarajevo
from Bosnian Serb shelling after their commanders forbade punitive Nato
air strikes.
UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko said UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and
General Bertrand Janvier, the chief UN commander, ruled out Nato
intervention in retaliation for a Serb attack which killed 11 people in
Butmir, a Sarajevo suburb, on Sunday.
''They (Bosnian Serbs) got away with murder,'' Ivanko added. ''We
realised we were not in a position to defend a UN 'safe area'.''
The UN commander in Bosnia, General Rupert Smith, asked for air
strikes. He was overruled because the UN feared reprisals and that Nato
action could upset a ceasefire between government troops and rebel Serbs
in Croatia.
Akashi justified his decision, telling reporters in Belgrade: ''For
the time being, because of the extremely delicate tense situation the
force commander and I do not feel the use of air power is the best
solution.''
The lack of response caused dismay at UN headquarters in Sarajevo and
anger in the city whose population know the Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) is
tightening its three-year siege.
At Tesanj in central Bosnia, Serb soldiers forced more than 100
elderly Muslim men and women to walk across a front line today after
expelling them from their homes.
The civilians, carrying a few belongings in bags, were escorted by
Serb soldiers through rugged hills to Bosnian government territory,
where they were met by Tesanj town authorities, a Reuters journalist
reported.
Mourners at funerals in Sarajevo for some of victims of Sunday's
shelling, the worst since the end of a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia,
shook their fists at overflying Nato jets.
''This is slaughter with the blessing of the UN,'' an elderly man
said.
Ivanko disclosed the UN did not pass on to the Bosnia government a
warning from the Serbs that they were preparing to attack Butmir.
Although there has been no outbreak of wider war in Bosnia since the
truce ended, the Serbs have steadily escalated their defiance of the UN
and the Muslim-led government
The town of Bihac has been shelled daily, with loss of civilian life,
and the government said four people died when northern Tuzla was shelled
yesterday.
The UN said the Serbs were now stoking confrontation by threatening
traffic on the only road to Sarajevo not under their control.
They could be even more stubborn over the reopening of Sarajevo
airport which they closed to aid flights a month ago by shooting at
aircraft.
Western envoys said the UN was appeasing Serbs at the prompting of
European governments who fear for the safety of their peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia.
Akashi met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today to discuss the
fighting in Croatia and possible next peace moves in Bosnia where both
sides refused to extend the truce.
Milosevic is at the centre of peace mediation by the Big Power Contact
Group -- the United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany -- whose
officials meet in London on Friday.--Reuter.

Antigua, Tuesday
A BRITISH tourist shot twice by robbers on the Caribbean holiday
island of Antigua was named by the Foreign Office today as Mr Robert
Perry, 41, a taxi driver from Liverpool.
He underwent emergency surgery to remove his ruptured spleen after he
was shot in the chest and groin. Other British tourists queued up to
give blood to help save him.
Mr Perry's girlfriend Karen Burns, 27, from Huyton, Merseyside, needed
three stitches to her scalp after she was pistol-whipped by the robbers
as they fled.
Antigua police have arrested one suspect and are continuing their
hunt, Minister of Tourism Bernard Percival said.
The couple were attacked yesterday, the last day of their holiday on
the island.
They had checked out of the Yepton Beach Resort in Deep Bay, but had
returned to their room to make sure they had not forgotten anything.
Two robbers made off with a bag containing personal documents,
passports and credit cards.
Another guest, Paul Franklin, 40, from London, said: ''I heard two
shots and ran round the corner and saw two hysterical maids.
''There was blood around and then the word came back that they needed
donors, so 25 of us got in cabs and went down. Only six actually had to
give blood.''
Mr Perry, from Thatto Heath, St Helens, was said to be critical but
stable in hospital today.
A keen diver and former lifeguard, it is thought he chose Antigua as a
holiday destination for its coral reefs.
It is the second time this year that a tourist has been shot by
robbers on the island which -- together with neighbouring Barbuda --
attracts around 50,000 British tourists each year.
Mr Percival said the shooting had prompted a special cabinet meeting
tomorrow to discuss tourist safety.--PA.

Jerusalem, Tuesday
A spokesman for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat expressed regret and
astonishment today over calls by US congressional leaders to move the
American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
An Israeli government official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, was also cool to the idea, saying it could backfire on
Israel and harm peace talks.
''We regret the position of the members of Congress who want to move
the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem at a time when the peace
process is facing great dangers,'' said Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman
for Arafat in Palestinian-ruled Gaza.
''We are astonished at the timing, when Israel is confiscating land in
Jerusalem,'' Rdainah told Reuters, referring to an Israeli plan to seize
131 acres in the Arab eastern sector that has caused an uproar in the
Arab world.
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed
it. Israel vows never to cede any part of the city. Palestinians want
the east side as capital of a future state.
US Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said yesterday he would introduce
legislation today to require work to start on a Jerusalem embassy by the
end of 1996.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich will announce an identical bill today,
Dole said in a speech to the annual conference of the American-Israel
Political Action Committee.
Only two countries, Costa Rica and El Salvador, have embassies within
Jerusalem's municipal boundaries -- testimony to the holy city's
disputed status as Israel's declared capital.
The PLO and Israel agreed in a 1993 peace deal to defer for up to
three years discussions on Jerusalem's future. Palestinians say changes
in the city's status before a final settlement violate the interim peace
accord.
''I want to make clear that Jerusalem will remain united under Israeli
sovereignty,'' Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal told a parliamentary
debate on a range of peace issues.
An Israeli government official said if the embassy was built on a
US-owned plot in Jewish West Jerusalem, the move could be tantamount to
declaring Israel has a right only to the west side of the city and not
the east.
''If they move to West Jerusalem, they will make clear from their deed
that there are two Jerusalems,'' the official said.
Moreover, he said, the United States ''will lose in the short term its
credibility as an honest mediator in the Middle East''.--Reuter.

Hamburg, Wednesday,
THE British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Talent got a smearing of
graffiti today when it docked in Hamburg accompanied by a swarm of
Greenpeace protesters in rubber boats.
The Talent's dull gray hull sported patches of fluorescent green paint
and anti-nuclear slogans after the environmental activists finished
their work.
The 115-member crew of the British submarine has a week of events in
the North Sea port city, including a breakfast hosted by the city's
government as a sign of friendship and alliance between Germany and
Britain.
But Greenpeace regards the 4700-ton subarine as a ''ticking nuclear
bomb'' and a relic of the Cold War.
''The presence of an atomic submarine in the heart of Hamburg puts the
population in danger of an atomic catastrophe,'' Greenpeace said in a
statement. Hamburg has a population of 1.7 million.
* A global treaty designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons is
likely to be made permanent tomorrw, under a compromise deal to resolve
tensions between developing countries and nuclear powers.
A senior diplomat who chairs the UN conference on the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) said today he hoped problems could be
resolved by then, avoiding a divisive vote that would deal a ''fatal
blow'' to the landmark agreement.
The lynchpin of disarmament, the NPT sanctions five nuclear powers and
provides for peaceful nuclear cooperation. It must be renewed now that
it has run for 25 years.
Most of the 178 nations that signed the treaty want to extend it
indefinitely to head off dangers in the post-Cold War world, shown by
the discovery of Iraq's nuclear programme and the current crisis over
North Korea.

Barclay McBain offers advice to students who are in the process of
choosing a course, university or college
SO you're interested in going on to higher education next year.
Whether you gain a place at university or college in September or
October 1996 with a clutch of Highers or a mix of the non-traditional
qualifications which now secure entry to the sector, one thing is
certain -- the choice facing you as you begin the process of matching
your personal and career ambitions with a course is bewildering.
Our Choices guides are of fundamental importance for candidates
seeking to find out about what courses are available and the
qualifications they are likely to need to take the degree they want at
the university or college of their choice.
The guides have full details of courses and the likely ''going rates''
at 23 Scottish higher education institutions. The Universities and
Colleges Admission Service processes application forms on behalf of 19
institutions in Scotland, 225 throughout the UK. With few exceptions,
candidates for admission to courses in the Scottish universities and
Queen Margaret College -- a university-sector institution in Edinburgh
-- apply through Ucas, the admissions body and clearing house.
Although the Choices guides also give the likely requirements for
courses offered by HE institutions specialising in such areas as
postgraduate teacher training, art, drama, and agriculture, these have
separate application systems.
Roddy Livingston, the Scottish Ucas board member and assistant
registrar at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, said: ''In Scotland
there is a rich range of courses available, and it is most important
that candidates are fully aware of what is available to them.''
In terms of candidates making themselves familiar with what is on
offer throughout the UK, Mr Livingston also singled out the Ucas
handbook and the University and College Entrance Guide. But focusing
north of the Border, the Choices guides, with their tables taken from
the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals (Coshep) entrance
guide to higher education in Scotland 1996, are an essential starting
point.
Mr Livingston pointed out: ''The Coshep guide gives a good indication
of the background to institutions and, very important, the courses which
they offer and the type of entry qualifications that are expected.
''But candidates should recognise that not all courses are the same in
different institutions. Just because they have the same title does not
mean they are offering exactly the same type of course or, indeed,
opportunities.
''Candidates should go to individual institutional prospectuses to get
more information about the structure of courses, their methods of
presentation, and the teaching and learning environment.
''Only then will they discover which courses are suited to their
needs. In making their choice they should not be backward in coming
forward to institutions themselves, attending open days and information
sessions, where they can speak to staff and seek further information and
advice if they need. And they should do all this in consultation with
their advisers, school guidance teachers, careers staff, parents and
friends. They should seek information from as wide an area as
possible.''
So what selection deadlines are looming ahead of you? For admission
next year, you'll need to return your Ucas form by December 15 (October
15 for Oxford and Cambridge). Between now and then the important thing
is to make the correct choice about what you want to do, taking advice
from as many people as you can. When you have an idea of the kind of
course you might be interested in you should look at the guides and
discuss with your teachers the qualifications you are likely to get.
When you have whittled down your choices, you should collect the
prospectuses from institutions on your short list and attend open days,
which tend to be held in August and September for the next year's
intake. All these sources of information will help when it comes to
filling in your form, which consists of three parts on top of your
course preferences:
* Factual information such as personal details about exams passed and
to be taken, and date of birth. According to Mr Livingston, 8% of
candidates get their date of birth wrong, which unnecessarily slows down
the application process.
* Your personal statement.
* A confidential reference from the school.
Said Mr Livingston: ''The personal statement is important because it
gives a flavour of the person, their interests, background, and the way
in which they might contribute to the course, socially as well as
academically. But with as many as 50 staff in each institution selecting
candidates we have to recognise that its importance will vary. Increased
space is being made available for the personal statement, and that is a
measure of the way in which we think it is important, because people are
coming from such a wide range of backgrounds and with a similar range of
entry qualifications.''
Institutions view the personal statement as very important. Mr
Livingston explained: ''The important thing is being able to look
forward. There is some criticism of taking decisions on the basis of
past achievement such as exam results. But they do not necessarily give
a good indication of future promise, and are not always a good predictor
of degree performance. The personal statement and the confidential
reference provide a look forward, which is very important when
institutions give the benefit of doubt to candidates who might not have
matched up exactly to entrance requirements. It is very important for
institutions to get as much relevant information as they can about a
candidate to help them make take a decision in the best interests of the
candidate.''
When you're filling in your Ucas form you'll be able to apply to a
maximum of six institutions, two fewer than those taking up places this
autumn. Everyone involved in this year's selection process agreed that
there's just too many applications swilling around the system -- about
2,800,000 in fact, given that there were about 400,000 candidates who
made on average nearly seven choices each.
Ucas will forward your choices to institutions, which will make you an
offer -- either conditional or unconditional -- or reject your
application. Institutions will make offers through to May and you will
be expected to make a reply to Ucas after you have received your last
offer. You will, of course, be able to reply before then if you are made
an unconditional, or no strings, offer which appeals to you.
When you reply, you have to make one firm and one insurance acceptance
from the six -- leaving aside outright rejections, of course. Your firm
acceptance might be conditional, but if your results match the
requirements, the institution must offer you a place.
Concern continues to be expressed about the insurance acceptance. What
if your insurance choice is the one which demands the least
qualifications but you find when you get your results that, although you
didn't get enough for your firm choice, you got more than was needed for
the insurance option? Well, you won't be able to shop around because
you're tied into the two.
Ucas has found that about 50% of candidates go for the course with the
lowest requirements as their insurance acceptance. But Mr Livingston's
advice on the matter is unequivocal: ''It is important for them to
realise that while they are entering firm commitments with their firm
and insurance choices, they should not choose as an insurance a course
they would not be happy with.'' Candidates should make sure that the
course they nominate as their insurance should genuinely be the one in
which they have the second highest interest, he said. ''They have to do
their homework a little better and focus their attention a little more
on the course.''
But it's not something you should worry about, because only about 8%
of candidates who secure places do so with their ''insurance''
institution. About 63% go on to their firm, or first choice institution.
For those candidates who do not secure a place after publication of
their results, clearing is available in August. Clearing seeks to place
them on courses where there are still places. It accounts for about 29%
of those placed.
For a variety of reasons about 10% of candidates offered places each
year do not take them up. But remember Mr Livingston's words:
''Providing candidates make a realistic and informed choice, they stand
a very good chance of being placed.''
Candidates should go to individual institutional prospectuses to get
more information about the structure of courses
Eight per cent of candidates get their date of birth wrong, which
slows down the application process

Round-the-clock homework. Overcrowded classrooms. All-night drinking
sessions. A constant diet of beans and super noodles. The myths
surrounding student life are endless. Stuart Millar helps you sort out
fact from fiction
1. University is about new experiences (True)
Remember how weird moving to secondary school felt? Multiply that by
10 and you begin to understand just how different university is. But
that is the challenge. The people who make the most of university are
usually the ones who throw themselves into every new experience, from
standing for election to waking up without a hangover. In the space of
four years, students learn more about themselves than at any other time.
Never again will they have the opportunity to discover so many new
interests and hidden talents.
2. University can be a lonely place (True)
The sheer size of a university can be very daunting. Most campuses
have a population equivalent to that of a small town. Many new students
-- or ''freshers'' in student-speak -- lose a lot of sleep about whether
they will fit in. It's easy to imagine that everybody else in your class
will be more intelligent/wittier/better looking/more popular than you.
But once term starts, there is so much going on that these fears quickly
disappear. The trick is to remember that even the loudest people are
having the same doubts.
3. All freshers are straight out of school (Bluff)
One of the beauties of university life is the diversity of its people.
The days when all students were 18 years old, white, middle class and
Scottish are long gone. Around half of those who start university in
October will be mature students -- people over 21 years old. And with
the massive growth in exchange programmes, campuses are increasingly
international. Nowadays, it is just as likely the student next to you is
from Sweden or Singapore as from Bellshill or Bathgate. The only trouble
is the mature and international students always seem to get the books
from the library first.
4. Once I choose a course or institution, I'm stuck with it (Bluff)
A quick glance through this guide will show the vast range of courses
and institutions now available in Scotland. Although most of you have a
clear idea what you want to do and where you want to do it, many are not
quite so sure. But nowadays, universities are prepared for this. The new
buzzword is flexibility, as more institutions introduce modular course
structures so students can sample a bit of everything before
specialising. So, if after two years of applied linguistics you decide
that metallurgy is more your thing, hope is not lost.
5. Help is always at hand (True)
It's unlikely that you'll make it through four years of university
without at least a minor hiccup, no matter how clever, organised or
unflappable you are. But most universities are bristling with people who
can help with anything ranging from money worries to sexual harassment.
The student union welfare office, which provides a confidential, drop-in
service run by students because they understand the problems best, is
always a good place to start looking for help. It's up to you, however,
to use these services.
6. The workload is enormous (True)
That students are skiving, lazy, good-for-nothings is a popular
misconception. They may only spend 15 hours a week at most in a lecture
theatre or laboratory, but at least another 20 hours will be spent
studying for exams, preparing tutorial presentations, writing essays or
generally trying to keep up with the course. And most students are
juggling college work with other commitments such as family or a
part-time job. Except English Lit students. They claim it's just as hard
work swanning about the library, drinking coffee and deconstructing
Sesame Street.
7. The workload is impossible (Bluff)
Developing sound study skills at university can mean the difference
between passing and failing. Some students try complicated techniques
like ''mind-mapping'', but more basic skills are just as effective.
Turning up at lectures fairly regularly, especially at 9am is always a
good move, although you will undoubtedly be the only person in the room
(including the lecturer). Speaking up in tutorials or seminars is
equally important, but just as uncommon. Despite their intellectual
image, most students will shrink into their polo neck when asked a
straight question by a tutor.
8. Academics are boring, unapproachable and wear flares (Bluff)
Only on those late night Open University programmes. One of the
biggest differences between school and university is the relationship
between staff and students. Because you are expected to behave like a
grown-up, you are treated as such. Freshers are as much a part of
departmental life as the staff. This means you no longer have to hide
under a table when a teacher appears in the pub because the chances are
you'll be drinking with the teacher. And on Friday mornings, it's always
the academics who look the worse for wear.
9. University libraries are hopelessly inadequate (True)
University libraries may have five floors and thousands of books, but
the simple truth is they never have the one you need. The first rule of
using the university library is never rely on it. The extra expense of
buying core textbooks is always worth it, especially come exam time when
300 students are fighting over that dog-eared first edition from 1937.
Libraries remain one of the social centres of university life, however,
as the noisy buzz of constant chatter suggests. It's amazing the kind of
people you can meet in there.
10. Students are virtually penniless (True)
Coping with money worries is a key skill for any student. Recent
National Union of Students figures suggest that students can expect to
have run up around #6000 of debt by the time they graduate. Most
students are forced to have at least one part-time job, often in a
low-paid position. Academics complain about the effect this pressure has
on the quality of work, but hardship is a recognised part of student
life in the 1990s. And, as the Government continues to cut grants and
squeeze money out of students' pockets, things look set to become
harder. If you do run into serious problems, the advisory service or the
welfare office can help.
11. University accommodation is the lap of luxury (Bluff)
Don't expect the Hilton. Don't even expect it to look like the
pictures in the university's glossy brochure. But university
accommodation has come a long way in recent years. The majority of
residences will be self-catering either in the form of flats shared with
other students or the more traditional ''room-off-corridors'' style.
Some even have en-suite bathrooms and hair dryers. But universities
struggle to keep up with demand so apply in plenty of time to avoid
missing out. And pray that your new room-mate is not a paranoid,
psychotic Whitney Houston maniac.
12. Private sector landlords are all saints (Bluff)
Remember Mr Rigby from Rising Damp? A frighteningly accurate portrayal
of a private sector landlord, many of whom have little understanding of
the law in general and their obligations in particular. Unfortunately,
neither do students, making them sitting targets for this lowly section
of society. From letting themselves in while you're in the bath or in
bed, to selling the place from underneath you, there is no end to the
tricks these people know. In some cases, students have been killed by
faulty appliances. It's little wonder that welfare offices deal with
more accommodation-related cases than almost any other problem.
13. Only sad people live at home (Bluff)
After reading 11 and 12 above the answer to this is obvious. OK, so
you may always have to run for the last train when your mates are going
to a club. Yes, you will inevitably become desperate for the toilet the
minute the train doors close. And it's true that taking the new-found
object of your desire home will be a strategic nightmare, but consider
the advantages. No rent. No bills. No dodgy landlords. Home cooking. Hot
and cold running water. A toilet that flushes. Need I go on?
14. Students eat rubbish (True)
It's often been said that the diet of the average student makes school
dinners look positively nutritional. At university, their consumption of
fat and calories soars. If they're not living off smoked sausage
suppers, it's only because Shoprite was doing a special offer on super
noodles. Students fall out of the library or bar late at night and are
forced to eat take-away or buy groceries from an over-priced convenience
store. Learning to cook before going to university may not only save you
from kwashiorkor, it will also seriously impress your starving
classmates.
15. Getting involved is a waste of time (Bluff)
Student politics gets a very bad press. Those who get involved are
labelled careerists or do-gooders. But working in the student union is
one of the best moves a student can make. Aside from the people you will
meet and the satisfaction of working for other students, union positions
also offer the best possible chance to develop skills that will be
useful long after university. A degree no longer guarantees a good job.
Employers want graduates who have shown that they can handle
responsibility and who already have a range of skills.
16. Students spend all their time clubbing (True)
Scottish student unions run hundreds of clubs and societies. From
Strathclyde's Big Fishue surreal society to Glasgow's Apple and
Pineapple Tango appreciation society, every taste can be catered for. As
well as these more bizarre groups, course and nationality-based
societies are among the most popular. The clubs are run by students on a
budget provided by the student union. Inevitably the cash is spent on
anything that provides an excuse to get drunk. Sports clubs give
students the chance to sample sports they would never otherwise have
tried, like paragliding or scuba-diving.
17. Campuses are awash with alcohol (True)
Student unions are among the largest alcohol suppliers in the country.
From the first day of Freshers Week (miss it at your peril), through the
Christmas all-nighters to the big end-of-term extravaganza, alcohol is
thrust upon students at a price -- although not a quality -- they would
have to be very stupid or very rich to refuse. A large part of
university life, therefore, is spent either at the bar or upside-down
under a table. Most students take this in their stride. But there are
always a few who can't shake the habit and finish up as MPs or
lecturers.
18. Students can dance (Bluff)
Students spend a lot of time in clubs. Student unions spend vast
amounts of money running discos. Yet students remain the saddest dancers
in Britain. Even the ones who were really cool at school discos suddenly
have this irresistible urge to shake their heads about and dance with
their shoulders. But the most desperate cases of all have to be the
students who will happily get up from a comfy seat at a table to go and
sit in beer and puke on the dance floor when ''Sit Down'' by James is
played. Get a life.
19. Students are knee-deep in contraceptives (True)
HIV and Aids are spreading most rapidly between the young and
heterosexual so students are a high risk group. Unwanted pregnancies
have destroyed many a promising academic career. Now, universities and
student unions are tackling these problems head-on by drowning new
students in a sea of safe sex leaflets and latex prophylactics. These
days it is easier to get a condom than a pint of Snakebite. There is
evidence, however, that students haven't quite grasped the message.
Although 98% believe condoms are effective, only one-third feel there is
any need to actually wear them.
20. All work and no play makes for a dull life (True)
The most successful students work hard and play hard. The pressure to
spend 12 hours a day under the library's buzzing fluorescent lights is
enormous. And financial hardship often means relaxing comes second to
surviving. But students also have unrivalled opportunities to enjoy
themselves. They can see films and plays on the cheap, and can spend the
long summer holidays travelling the world on a shoestring. And even if
it means just leaving the books alone for one day every week, balancing
hard work with good fun is the key to a happy, successful four years.

University of Aberdeen
Founded in 1495, the University of Aberdeen combines 500 years of
tradition and distinguished scholarship with the latest technological
advances in teaching and research. Aberdeen has as the oil capital of
Europe absorbed rapid technical developments without losing any of its
charms. It is a friendly city, small enough, with only 250,000
inhabitants, to maintain its personality yet large enough to offer a
wide range of activities to satisfy all tastes. There are magnificent
golden beaches, fine coastal scenery, and beautiful countryside.
The university has 10,000 students, representing about 80
nationalities. It offers university accommodation for about half its
students. Halls of residence are on campus or within walking distance. A
place in hall is guaranteed to all first-year students whose homes are
not within commuting distance. There is also a wide range of university
properties and private housing.
Admission to the university is to a degree programme, not to a
department. Some such as medicine are vocational. Others offer
flexibility to construct a BSc or MA. Students on an MA programme may,
for instance, take a law or science subject, and those doing a BSc may
include a language, economics or another non-science course. Students
who wish to study in North America for a year have access to a range of
exchange studentships; there are also many Erasmus opportunities for
studying in Europe.
The University of Abertay Dundee
The three faculties of Science, Management, and Engineering &amp;
Construction offer a broad range of stimulating undergraduate and
postgraduate degree and diploma courses, most of which form part of a
modular system which gives added flexibility and helps students to
tailor their courses to suit their own career interests. Many innovative
courses have recently been introduced, including degree courses in
European business law, forest products technology, and mechatronics.
The university works closely with employers to ensure new and existing
courses meet the demands of today's business environment. Responding to
the need for graduates with personal skills, the university offers
valuable courses in such areas as chemistry with business studies and
mathematics with business methods. Numerous courses offer work
experience. The university also offers several degrees which incorporate
European languages and the opportunity to study in another European
university.
A programme of HND courses provides successful students with direct
access to the final stages of degree courses. In the past, graduates
have entered employment with companies such as General Accident, Rolls
Royce, Balfour Beatty, KPMG and British Gas.
Dundee is a real student city. Our facilities are in a city centre
campus. Students have access to modern, well-equipped halls and
self-catering accommodation. All applicants are invited to attend open
days.
The University of Dundee
Now incorporating the former Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, it
is on the banks of the Tay estuary, five-minutes from the city centre.
The community comes from throughout the UK: 53% Scots, 24% English and
Welsh: 13% Northern Irish: plus 4% from the rest of the European Union,
and 6% overseas, offering a rich blend of backgrounds, cultures and
attitudes. It offers a network of exchanges and, for some courses,
placements in the EU, North America, and throughout the world. Open
learning language programmes allow you to develop communication skills
in at least one other EU language.
sporting activities derive in part from most of accommodation being on
or near our campus. Accommodation is guaranteed to all new students
living outside Dundee district. and about 7000 full-time undergraduates
are offered an extremely wide range of courses. A large number of
subjects and degrees are grouped in two faculties: Arts and Social
Sciences, and Science and Engineering. These faculties offer a flexible
course structure.
In the remaining faculties, vocational degrees such as accountancy,
art, design, and dentistry have a more structured curriculum. A number
of courses recognised by professional bodies are housed on the campus in
Duncan of Jordanstone College, which has first-class custom-built
facilities. Student-staff committees are one of the ways in which the
success of courses is evaluated.
Edinburgh College of Art
The college offers an exceptional variety of degree courses in Art and
Design and Environmental Studies, intended to develop students'
creativity and analytical skills. In 1986 Heriot-Watt University
recognised the Schools of Art and Design as a joint faculty of the
college and university. The number of full-time students now exceeds
1500.
Teaching at the college is primarily studio or workshop-based,
supported by lectures, seminars, tutorials and study visits. The Faculty
of Environmental Studies contains the schools of architecture, landscape
architecture, and planning and housing; while the schools of drawing and
painting, sculpture, design and crafts and department of humanities form
the Faculty of Art and Design. The school of drawing and painting has
specialist sections in printmaking and tapestry and the school of design
and crafts offers about 15 specialist subject areas in applied arts,
applied design, visual communications.
The National Galleries of Scotland with important collections of old
master paintings, Scottish portraiture and modern art, are to be found
in the city centre, within walking distance of the College of Art
campus.
Admission to the Faculty of Environmental Studies is to a particular
school. Admission to the common first-year course in art and design is
by direct application to the College through the Scottish Art Schools
Joint Application Scheme. Open days are organised each year by
particular schools or faculties.
University of Edinburgh:
The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1583, has a strong innovative
tradition in the arts, medicine and the sciences. It is at the forefront
of development in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, languages,
microelectronics, and Scottish studies. Edinburgh is also a major
international research centre, and offers a wealth of library material
and computer resources.
There are more than 13,000 undergraduates in eight faculties: Arts,
Divinity, Law, Medicine, Music, Science and Engineering, Social Sciences
and Veterinary Medicine. It offers a wide range of courses -- from
traditional academic disciplines to ''hi-tech'' degrees. Much of the
university is located around George Square, near the city centre, with
the Faculty of Science and Engineering on its own campus.
More than 5500 students live in halls of residence, offering mainly
full board in single study-bedrooms, or in student houses or university
flats. First-year students from outside Edinburgh who apply early are
offered a place in university accommodation. Most other students live in
flats or lodgings in the city. Pollock Halls of Residence are within
easy walking distance of both campuses. First-class welfare, social and
sports facilities are provided by the university and the active Students
Association. The university has a sports centre and playing fields, plus
an outdoor centre on the shores of Loch Tay.
Glasgow Caledonian University:
The university offers quality in its teaching, learning and working
environments and its responsiveness to employer and market needs.
The City Campus, in the city centre, houses the main administrative
centres and the Faculty of Science and Technology, plus much of the
Faculty of Business. In the West End, Park Campus houses the rest of the
Business Faculty, while the Southbrae Campus, in Jordanhill, is home to
the Faculty of Health.
The university promotes real-life problem-solving and a commitment to
European culture and language. Links exist with almost every European
nation and staff and student exchanges and joint research and teaching
have been developed across the world.
The university has restructured the academic year into two 15-week
semesters. By 1996, new undergraduate degree programmes will be
available in Consumer and Trading Standards, Business Economics,
European Business Studies, Technology, Architectural Technology,
Interior Design, Property Management and Development, Environment and
Building Services Engineering.
Spacious landscaped areas and grassy sites share space with lecture
halls, custom-built facilities for science and technology,
top-of-the-range computer facilities, a gymnasium and Students Union
Building. The university is discussing plans to add to its existing
student accommodation at Gibson Hall, Red Road Court and David Naismith
Court.
Glasgow School of Art:
The School of Art is one of the biggest in the UK, with 100 academic
staff and a student population of 1300. The campus, incorporating the
magnificent Mackintosh Building, offers easy access to Glasgow's many
amenities, including art galleries and museums.
Undergraduate courses, validated by the University of Glasgow, are
offered in Design, Fine Art, Product Design Engineering and
Architecture. All Art and Design students follow a joint first-year
programme. Thereafter, they enter one of the specialist departments of
the School of Design and Craft such as ceramics, textiles and product
design or the School of Fine Art where options include environmental
art, painting, and photography.
The Mackintosh School of Architecture offers degrees and diplomas in
architecture. From September the school will offer accommodation in
purpose-built, self-catering flats on campus. Priority will be given to
new entrants who cannot commute.
Applications to courses leading to BA degrees in Design and Fine Art
must be made directly to the school. Selection is normally based on
academic qualifications and a portfolio of work. Selected candidates for
architecture courses will be asked to attend for interview and to bring
a portfolio of their work; applicants are expected to show evidence of
an interest in architecture, and to exhibit skill in drawing and a
general interest in the arts.
University of Glasgow:
Founded in 1451, Glasgow is one of the oldest and biggest universities
in the UK with more than 14,000 full-time undergraduates, about 11% from
overseas. It has around 1200 academic and administrative and nearly 2000
support staff. It is situated one and a half miles from the city centre.
Not on campus are the Dental Hospital and School, and the School of
Veterinary Medicine, although pre-clinical teaching is on campus.
There are more than 120 teaching departments. Glasgow University
trains almost half the new doctors, dentists and veterinary surgeons in
Scotland. These represent, however, only a small proportion of the
annual graduate output of about 2500. In the recent review of teaching
quality, all departments so far inspected have been awarded one of the
top two rankings.
There are two mixed student unions offering social amenities and
organising debates, meetings and discos. Glasgow University Union has
won the World Student Debating Championship twice and the Observer Mace
several times.
Indoor facilities include sauna, steam room, weight-training room,
squash courts and cardiovascular conditioning area. Students have access
to the Kelvin Hall International Sports Arena (close to the campus),
offering some of the most modern facilities available in the UK. Other
sports are available at nearby athletic grounds, and a new outdoor
sports complex will be completed in the next two years.
Heriot-Watt University
The university, in Edinburgh, is an innovative, technologically based
institution, forward-looking and committed to the highest academic
standards in topics of direct industrial, commercial and social
relevance. Its students enjoy graduate employment prospects which are
consistently among the best.
The university's biggest faculties -- Science, Engineering and
Economic and Social Studies -- are on a single campus at Riccarton, west
Edinburgh. As well as the academic and amenity buildings and student
residences there are excellent facilities for most sports.
A vital aspect of Heriot-Watt is the rich mix of complementary
subjects and cultures in the associated colleges. The faculties of
Environmental Studies and Art and Design are based at the Edinburgh
College of Art campus. The Institute of Education at Moray House covers
teacher training and other professions. The Scottish College of Textiles
in nearby Galashiels constitutes the Faculty of Textiles, a national
centre of excellence.
Heriot-Watt values its exceptionally strong links with industry,
commerce and the public sector. The industrial research park which is
part of Riccarton campus exemplifies this approach. The university
places a strong emphasis on information technology. Information
technology is a specific feature of a number of courses. Heriot-Watt
promotes a flexible and constructive approach to admission on the basis
of a wide variety of qualifications, experience, and the ability to
learn.
Moray House College of Education
From an original commitment to the training of teachers the institute
has expanded its activities and now offers a wide range of pre-service
and in-service courses several related professions: teaching, community
education, social work, recreation management, sports coaching and arts
administration.
The Holyrood campus, in the heart of Edinburgh's ''Old Town'',
consists of a number of buildings, old and new. Old Moray House dates
from the early 17th century. The Cramond campus (formerly Dunfermline
College of Physical Education) has playing fields along with the other
specialist facilities and is situated six miles west of Edinburgh.
Each campus has halls of residence and each provides excellent
facilities. The institute also has an outdoor centre at Kingussie in the
Highlands. The atmosphere of the institute is enriched by the presence
of the Scottish Centre for International Education, with students from
many parts of the world.
For most courses applicants have a professional interview and, in the
case of the Physical Education course, there are also tests of
performance in physical activities. Interview procedures involve
appropriate field professionals in addition to Moray House staff.
Applicants to undergraduate courses should be made to UCAS; an exception
is the BA (Social Work) where the application is to SWAS.
Napier University
The university has more than 9000 students and its degree and diploma
courses are strongly geared towards the world of work. Napier works
closely with industry and commerce in course and student development.
Many courses include a period of supervised work experience, or
''sandwich'', in the industrial and commercial environment.
Napier graduates have a high success rate in finding jobs and going on
to further courses. Students learn communication, leadership, and
team-building skills. The university's four faculties -- Applied Arts,
Engineering, the Business School, and Science -- offer a range of
mainly-vocational courses. Undergraduate degree courses are modular so
that students can choose from a wide range of topics for parts of their
courses. A mathematics student may also study Music or a foreign
language, for example.
Lectures and tutorials are complemented by student-centred methods of
teaching and learning such as guided independent study and group work.
These, allied to the modular scheme, enable students to plan and
structure their work in flexible and individual ways. Libraries on each
campus support academic activities.
Advisory and counselling services are available and sport and
recreation are catered for on campus. Napier has a flexible admissions
policy, and aims to offer a place to any applicant with ability to
benefit from the education available at the university.
Northern College of Education
The college has two campuses, at Aberdeen and Dundee.
Aberdeen: The campus, two miles from the city centre, has two halls of
residence, providing accommodation for 120 mainly first-year students,
plus two blocks of purpose-built catering flats for 120 students. The
grounds of the campus contain a range of facilities for academic and
social interests. The research, library and information facilities are
excellent. Many of the oil companies are keen to involve student groups
in collaborative exercises.
Dundee: Set on the River Tay three miles from Dundee city centre, the
college offers first-class facilities for all courses, and has a variety
of academic and leisure facilities on campus. These include: library,
resource centre, and theatre and drama studio. College accommodation is
available for about 300 students, and there are many independently
leased flats.

WELCOME to Choices, the essential guide to higher education in
Scotland.
Today and next Wednesday, May 17, The Herald is exclusively publishing
the qualifications and grades likely to be needed to get into each
degree and diploma course offered by Scotland's 23 higher education
institutions next year.
The two supplements build up to an indispensable bank of information
for pupils and parents; adults seeking to go into, or return to,
university or higher education college; careers and guidance teachers;
and the careers service generally.
The Herald is also sponsoring the information in paperback form, which
appears as the Scottish Higher Education Guide, produced by the
Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals. For information about
obtaining a copy of the guide, see Page 10.
Our Choices supplements and the Coshep guide give the likely ''going
rates'' for courses, and where they are offered. The information applies
to courses beginning in the autumn of 1996, although the deadline for
applying is December 15 this year.
On these two pages you will find a guide to using the supplements. We
start on this page, going on to Page 3, with an alphabetical index of
degree and diploma courses. It will also be published next week. It
tells you which tables have details about which courses -- where they
are offered and the qualifications you are likely to need to secure a
place on them.
Today you will find essential information about courses from
accountancy to engineering. Next week there will be details about the
remaining ones, from English to veterinary science. In both cases we
start with the Scottish Certificate of Education ''going rates''
followed by the GCE requirements.
The panel on Page 3 gives you the table and guide number for each
subject area, beginning with accountancy (table one, guide one) and
ending with veterinary medicine (guide two, table 51) It will also be
published next week.
By collecting both supplements you will build up not only a complete
guide to each course at each institution but also a ''user-friendly''
reference system which makes it easy to find out about the courses that
interest you.
The table for each course gives the probable number of Highers and the
grades needed, the Higher subjects needed and/or recommended, and the
Standard Grades necessary or recommended.
Useful notes are also provided -- for example, to tell applicants that
they will be interviewed; that they may spend a part of their course
abroad; or that they may take a course offered in collaboration with a
further education college if they do not attain the HE institution's
''going rate.''
Coshep has again decided to include general information about the Open
University in Scotland, although its courses do not appear in the tables
because it has such a distinctive admissions' system.
In addition to information about Scotland's 14 universities and Queen
Margaret College, a university-sector institution in Edinburgh, our
supplements and the Coshep guide also give the likely ''going rates''
for courses offered by higher education colleges specialising in such
areas as education, art, music, drama, agriculture, and textiles. They
have all merged or formed less formal links with the universities.
Publication of the Choices supplements and the Coshep guide has been
welcomed by representatives of the higher education sector who are
involved in the recruitment of students.
Jennifer Foulds, head of Strathclyde University's schools and college
liason service, said: ''For people like me in different institutions the
guide encapsulates Scottish higher education in very readable form. It
is a very pragmatic document. Parents need that pragmatism. If they have
had no involvement in higher education they could get lost in jargon.
The guide avoids that risk.''

Brussels,
BRITAIN should sign the social chapter of Maastricht and stop taking
such a negative attitude to Europe, the TUC general secretary, Mr John
Monks, said in Brussels yesterday.
He was speaking on the day the TUC published an opinion poll
suggesting that 66% of British people believed Britain should drop its
opt-out to the chapter.
The poll, conducted by NOP, was commissioned by the TUC and showed
that only 23% of those questioned supported the opt-out. There were 11%
with no opinion.
Mr Monks said the poll showed a clear national consensus for European
minimum rights at work. ''It will come as a blow to those Conservative
politicians who believe that hostility to Europe is the key to their
salvation,'' he said. Labour is committed to signing the chapter if it
wins the next General Election.
Later, in a speech to the European TUC's annual congress, he
criticised the Government's ''pick-and-choose'' approach to Europe and
called for an end to hesitancy on the question of a European single
currency. ''We should say yes to Emu (economic and monetary union) on
the right terms,'' he said.
Mr Monks said the terms included a commitment to full employment at
the heart of the integration process in Europe. ''That means investment,
finance and equalisation policies must be arranged if Emu is not to be a
deflationary lead weight on large parts of the EU,'' he warned.
He backed his criticisms of the Government's ''untenable'' position on
the social chapter of Maastricht by arguing that at least 109
multi-national companies qualified under the terms of the European works
council directive, despite the Government's attempts to escape its
obligations through the opt-out.
He also condemned wholesale deregulation, saying: ''Over 50 million of
our fellow citizens live below the poverty line in the EU. It is an
absolute scandal that a quarter of these are British citizens. This is
the fruit of the British Government's policies of deregulation.''
Mr Monks yesterday wrote to the Employment Secretary, Mr Michael
Portillo, urging him to bring together the trade unions and
Confederation of British Industry for talks on a joint approach to
tackling unemployment.

<HEADLINE>Gamekeepers turn poachers as accountancy firms snap up redundant tax specialists.  VAT officers find a private haven</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAIN WILSON, CHIEF REPORTER</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978469077</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SWINGEING job cuts in Customs and Excise have led to an upsurge in
staff turning from gamekeeper to poacher.
A number of specialists in VAT controls have been snapped up by
accountancy firms in Scotland after taking voluntary redundancy. Their
expertise in revenue collection is of value to accountants, especially
at independent tribunals into disputed VAT assessments.
A Customs and Excise spokesman stressed that former staff would not
pass on any inside information about any investigations into firms that
were represented by their new employers. They had signed the Official
Secrets Act.
He said of the growing transfers from public to private sector: ''We
like to think that accountants and Customs and Excise are working
together. We do not see them as the enemy but in the same business of
getting things right.''
Chartered accountants Ernst and Young, among the firms recruiting
former Customs and Excise officers, said business was buoyant in such
areas as VAT, where there was a shortage of skills in the profession.
A spokesman stressed that recruits, who would be ''trained in the ways
of the private sector'', were not allowed to work with firms they had
known when in Customs and Excise.
A larger than expected rush for voluntary redundancy or early
retirement has followed the Government's announcement of 4000 job
losses, a near 25% cut over the next five years.
More than 730 applications have already been approved -- causing Mr
Mike Rickwood, of the Customs and Excise Change Management Unit, to warn
in a confidential memorandum of an ''alarming'' collapse in staff
morale.
He also told Mrs Valerie Strachan, chairman of Customs and Excise,
that concern about the future is spreading to operational staff,
possibly resulting in a loss of productivity.
Mr Michael McCann, Scottish secretary of the Civil and Public Services
Association, said he was not surprised that so many staff were applying
to leave. He added: ''People want to get out because they feel that the
cuts mean there are no career prospects, the future does not look good,
and they are no longer able to provide a public service.''
However, the rush for voluntary redundancy in Scotland, where the
workforce of 1650 will fall by 400, has been far slower than in England.
Mr Andy Geelan, CPSA branch secretary, whose Customs and Excise
members cover the Scottish west coast, confirmed some staff have joined
accountancy firms but stressed: ''Many are staying because they have
nowhere else to go. Jobs are few and far between.''
Mr Geelan added that Scottish staff wanted compulsory redundancy
because it offered better terms -- despite union threats of industrial
action if job losses were imposed.
He said revenue collection sub-offices at Linwood and Newton Stewart
would close, with other likely candidates beingGalashiels, Kirkcaldy,
Peterhead, and Stirling.
Meanwhile, on the Customs side, officials confirmed the 24-hour
anti-smuggling and anti-drugs intelligence-gathering unit at Sighthill,
Edinburgh, was now working only office hours.
It is expected only the Paisley intelligence unit will remain as a
round-the-clock operation after a review is completed soon.
A spokesman said the rationalisation would make sense because new
technology and improved intelligence, including a European network,
could identify likely targets.
However, insiders said it was ''pathetic'' to expect fewer front-line
officers to cover the 7000-mile Scottish coastline.
They were demoralised, they said, and questioned how the Government
could reconcile its tough stance on law and order with the cuts,
including 2000 VAT inspectors and 550 front-line anti-smuggling
officers.

Gentle Sergeant, was set and in which she appeared. She will join the
staff and children in their 50th anniversary celebrations and hopes to
be reunited with the American sergeant of the title, her hero and
friend, Hugh O'Reilly.
Blantyre-born Sister Genevieve, who spent 17 years in Japan and now
lives in retirement in a small convent in Dumfries, said yesterday:
''The invitation came as a complete surprise.''
It was just after the Second World War when she was sent on her first
overseas posting -- as kindergarten nurse at a poverty-stricken
orphanage in Osaka. She and the seven other Sisters of Charity had to
look after 200 children with practically no money, food, clothes or
proper accommodation. Some of the children suffered frostbite and were
bitten by rats in their huts.
Into this dismal scene marched Hugh O'Reilly, of the 27th US Infantry
Regiment -- The Wolfhounds. Born in the Bronx, he had fought through the
war in the Far East and hated the Japanese.
Howeevr, when ordered to help with the Christmas party at the
orphanage, he took along food and gifts for the youngsters. Sergeant
O'Reilly was so impressed by the work Sister Genevieve was doing and the
plight of the youngsters that he launched a fund-raising campaign in his
unit.
The Wolfhounds raised 1m yen -- enough to build a new orphanage. Even
when posted to Korea in 1950, the soldiers still sent a generous monthly
sum to the sisters.
In 1955, Columbia Pictures turned the story into a feature film, with
Aldo Ray as the sergeant. Sister Genevieve, who by this time was in
charge of the orphanage, played one of the sisters and Mr O'Reilly was
on location as an adviser.
In 1988, Cilla Black's Surprise, Surprise programme flew Mr O'Reilly,
a father of six, from his home in Hawaii for a reunion with Sister
Genevieve in London. She said yesterday: ''He's a wonderful man, with a
heart of gold. I hope I'll meet him again in Japan.''
Sister Genevieve will be accompanied on her month-long trip -- in July
-- by her niece, Sister Anna McBride, who is a member of the same order
of nuns and is based in Newcastle upon Tyne.
Next month, Sister Genevieve and her small community will hold a
coffee morning to raise cash for the orphanage and she is planning to
sell some of her Japanese souvenirs -- parasols and fans -- which she
brought back all these years ago.

ANTI-ROADS campaigner, Ms Emma Must, from London, has won a Goldman
Environmental Foundation Prize, and immediately donated the #47,000
award to the fight against road building.
Ms Must is giving the cash to Alarm UK (The Alliance Against Road
Building), of which she is a founder member. The organisation is
supporting the opposition in Glasgow to the M77 extension.
The American-based Goldman prize is regarded as the Green Oscar and is
given to individuals who have played a significant role in bringing
about environmental change. This is the first time the award has been
won by Britain against stiff opposition from the rest of Europe.
Ms Must said: ''I feel that the award should go to the organisation as
we have all contributed to try and stop the Government's motorway
strategies. The recognition of winning the award shows that we have been
successful in highlighting the efforts of road protesters up and down
the country.''

SIR MICHAEL HERRIES, OBE, former chairman of the Royal Bank of
Scotland and one of the best-known characters in the Scottish business
community, has died suddenly at the age of 72.
He was knighted for services to the community and commerce in Hong
Kong, where he was Chief Executive (Taipan) of international traders
Jardine Matheson.
However, Sir Michael will be best remembered in Scotland for helping
to steer the Royal Bank through a complex bid situation and on to a
highly successful growth strategy.
Prior to his retirement five years ago, he presided over some of the
bank's most tumultuous times, notably in 1981 during an intense
international battle for control.
A proposed merger with English-based Standard Chartered provoked less
welcome attention in the form of another bid from the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank, headed by Mr Michael Sandberg who promised a European
headquarters for Edinburgh.
This move was resisted by the Royal's board, headed by Sir Michael,
and the Bank of England.
Despite the Royal's future being secured by the intervention of the
Monopolies Commission, which blocked both bids, Sir Michael was later to
remark that the Hongkong Shanghai bid was the worst moment in his 14
years as chairman.
His business activities also included the chairmanship of Dumfries and
Galloway Enterprise, while he headed Scottish Mortgage &amp; Trust Company
and was a member of other boards, including Scottish Widows.
Lord Younger of Prestwick, the present chairman of the Royal Bank of
Scotland Group, yesterday said Sir Michael, his predecessor, had had a
most distinguished career and had also been a great friend for many
years.
''His chairmanship of the Royal Bank of Scotland from 1978 to 1991
produced many changes in bringing together the various different banks
to make the single UK clearing bank under The Royal Bank of Scotland
brand name,'' said Lord Younger.
''He made a great contribution and the directors have sent condolences
to Lady Herries and her family.''
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said he was greatly saddened to learn of
Sir Michael's death and described him as one of Galloway's most
distinguished sons.
''He was deservedly well known and respected throughout the country
and beyond from his sucessful business career, culminating in the
chairmanship of the Royal Bank of Scotland.
''Locally, however, he was better known as a dedicated and friendly
Lord Lieutenant of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and as an enthusiastic
and committed chairman of Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise.''
Mr Lang added: ''He took an enormous interest in local affairs and had
a genuine desire to help all manner of folk. To me, he was a good friend
and a valued source of sound advice.''
Sir Michael is survived by Lady Elizabeth Herries, two sons and a
daughter.

THE chief constable of Strathclyde, Mr Leslie Sharp, Scotland's most
charismatic policeman, is to retire at the end of the year.
His decision to quit has been known to senior officers in other forces
and to senior Labour figures at Strathclyde region, the police
authority, for some days.
However, it came as a surprise to his force, Britain's second largest.
He has emerged as a major public figure in the past four years of
headline-grabbing police work, shaking entrenched Scottish perceptions
and playing an important role in first halting and then reversing the
seemingly inevitable rise in recorded crime figures.
Normally staid police officers who have worked with him describe him
unhesitatingly as an inspiring leader of men. Senior figures outwith the
force are openly impressed by his ability to think strategically,
identifying major crime problems and deploying the human resources
necessary to tackle them.
At times, his tactics were controversial, even risky, as when he
denuded some major towns of police cover for periods of days and weeks
in order to run campaigns such as Operation Blade, which policed
youthful knifemen out of the city centre in Glasgow.
There was a high potential for disaster in some areas during that
operation and others, such as the purge in the East End, which curbed
violence in the wake of the gangland murder of Mr Arthur Thompson Jr.
These high-profile operations relied heavily on the co-operation of
the media and the catchy names attracted column inches -- Blade, Bud,
Spur, Dove, Hawk, Turnkey, or Dragon. There were photo calls aplenty
with Kalashnikovs and the swords and bayonets going into the furnace.
By last year, Mr Sharp had hoped to turn the crime-figures clock
backby 10 years. He came within a spit of succeeding. The fall in
recorded crime figures continues, with a greater concentration on
intelligence-based policing, including the surveillance and targeting of
specific criminals and the use of high-technology techniques such as
automatic fingerprint recognition.
Mr Sharp yesterday refused to confirm his retirement yet it is an open
secret that he will tell the police authority in June that he will leave
the force at the end of December.
His timing -- immediately before local government reorganisation for
which his force has had to prepare very hard -- may seem strange but his
view is that there is probably never going to be a good time to call a
halt.
Mr Sharp, who is 59 this week, emerged from a short leet four and a
half years ago after being chief constable of Cumbria. He has retained
his house near Penrith, preferring to live ''over the shop'' in the
well-appointed flat above Strathclyde Police Headquarters in Pitt
Street, Glasgow, during his tenure. He is married with four daughters
and five grandchildren.
The force spokesman, Superintendent Louis Munn, said yesterday that Mr
Sharp wanted to make it known that before he could retire he required to
give formal notice to the police authority and that no such written
notice had been given.
The question of succession will loom large in coming weeks but of the
three obvious Scottish candidates, Mr John Orr and Mr William Wilson are
the front runners. The feeling is that Mr Ian Oliver of Grampian,
despite his outstanding credentials, has made too many powerful
political enemies. Mr Orr has the advantage of having had a Strathclyde
career, ending at the top of the CID.
From England, the candidate on everyone's lips is Bill Taylor, chief
constable of City of London Police and a high flyer for whom great
things are predicted. He might see Strathclyde as an ideal
stepping-stone to higher office.
Meanwhile, envious eyes will be cast on the job from across the North
Channel. The RUC is widely predicted to be slimming down from its
present 13,000 officers policing around one million people. That force
has two deputy chief constables and nine assistants, some of whose names
are already being canvassed.

<HEADLINE>'Accidents' at sea cause false alarms</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978469082</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Almost every sea rescue operation last year in response to a special
satellite signalling system on yachts and powerboats turned out to be a
false alarm, according to the coastguard.
They were caused by the accidental triggering of the system and are
costing millions of pounds a year.
Last year, 96% of the 493 alarms raised by vessels equipped with
EPIRB, Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio Beacon, equipment were
false. They can be caused by a variey of reasons, from hard bumps to
salt-water spray.
The coastguard says these false alarms have been rising over the
years. Apart from the expense of the call-outs, helicopters and lifeboat
crews are perhaps being diverted from real emergencies.
Last week, a major air and sea rescue was mounted in the Clyde: an
emergency distress beacon aboard a yacht moored in the Kyles of Bute had
been set off accidentally.
A Sea King helicopter from HMS Gannet in Prestwick joined RNLI crew
from Troon and Tighnabruaich and a police launch in a fruitless
three-hour search and rescue mission.
With the advent of satellite communications, these false alerts are
becoming a worldwide problem for the rescue services, as every alarm
signal has to be investigated thoroughly.
A Sea King helicopter alone costs #7000 an hour to operate.
Experts in the Marine Safety Agency say many could be avoided if
boatowners would ensure their emergency equipment is properly mounted so
that it could not be set off accidentally.
An MSA spokesman in Southampton said: ''A hard knock, poor maintenance
of batteries, and salt-water spray can accidentally activate these
systems. We recently issued a special 'Notice to Mariners' pointing up
the problems associated with this and other types of equipment such as
the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS), all of which use
satellite communications.''
The MSA is working with manufacturers of such safety equipment to
ensure defects are identified.
Mr Peter Dymond, chief operations officer of H M Coastguard in
Southampton said it had become an international problem.
''H M Coastguard always responds to EPIRB alerts and treats every one
in the same way as emergency calls through the 999 network.''
* During the VE Day holiday weekend, the coastguard emergency Channel
16, to which all vessels tune, was blocked twice by boatowners on the
Clyde who had left their radio transmitter buttons switched on. One
yacht's crew was listening to a BBC Radio Scotland football match and
this was being broadcast over the emergency frequency, blocking contact
with the Clyde coastguard in Greenock.

POLICE in Glasgow are concerned about the safety of an eight-year-old
boy.
It is believed he was taken from his mother's home by her estranged
husband after the couple had a violent argument, during which the woman
suffered a broken wrist.
The boy, Thomas Rogers, has not been seen since Sunday night and
police inquiries at the homes of friends and relatives have failed to
discover the youngster or his father, also named Thomas.
Ms Donna Murphy, 28, of Ardnahoe Avenue, Toryglen, Glasgow, said last
night: ''I'm really worried. I just want to know where Thomas is.''
The boy has fair hair, blue eyes, pale complexion, and was wearing a
black Puma tracksuit top, grey tracksuit bottoms and black training
shoes.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Aitkenhead Road Police
Station.

Robbie Dinwoodie reports on the question of the day at the Perth and
Kinross hustings.
THE party of strong defence was holed below the water-line during the
Perth and Kinross hustings yesterday, when Tory candidate John Godfrey
was unable to name the Scottish regiments -- not even the pride of
Perthshire, the Black Watch.
The monarchy, VE Day and defence had been the weekend themes of the
Tories, a line which began to unravel when the Save Our Infantry
Campaign turned on Conservative tactics as ''the delirium of a dying
party.''
Mr Godfrey fielded this comfortably enough, saying of campaign leader
Douglas Robson -- an ex-Tory councillor close to former Defence Minister
Archie Hamilton -- that he was not convinced that Mr Robson represented
the campaign. ''I take it very much with a pinch of salt,'' said Mr
Godfrey.
However, asked then as a ''starter for ten, no conferring'' whether he
could name the Scottish regiments the Tory candidate began to flounder.
''I am not going to get into a listing process,'' he said, but his
campaign was already listing to starboard.
''What about the number of regiments?'' asked another reporter, in a
vain attempt to elicit a response.
Even Mr Godfrey's minder, Aberdeen South MP Raymond Robertson, was
vague on the details of the controversial merger of the Gordons on his
own doorstep but at least he mentioned the Black Watch.
All of this could have been shrugged off as just another of the
tripwires which have dogged the Tory campaign so far, but when the SNP
candidate was hit with the same question, her response was rather
better.
''Seven,'' said Ms Roseanna Cunningham, citing the Black Watch, the
Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the New Highland Regiment, The King's
Own Scottish Borders, The Royal Highland Fusiliers, The Royal Scots and
the Scots Guards. In fact, she was one out, since the Scots Guards are
not technically a part of the Scottish Division, but it was a decent
effort all the same.
It was now the question of the day, and Labour candidate Douglas
Alexander, whose homework had been faultless hitherto, was forced into
some unaccustomed waffle. He mentioned the Highland Division, presumably
the merged regiment, the Argylls and the long defunct Highland Light
Infantry, and then came back to the Gordons, before conceding that he
was ''not sure how many regiments there were.''
The Liberal Democrats did extremely well in the test, but the
invigilators are still checking this out. Mrs Veronica Linklater's
response was excellent -- identical in fact to that of Ms Cunningham,
even down to her error.
It transpired that the SLD had an observer at the SNP press conference
-- spy would be putting it too strongly since she signed her name and
party on the guest list. However, the party said later that its
candidate would have got ''at least four or five right'' without
assistance.
Mr Godfrey has the look of the class swot about him, but the next time
he is caught not doing his homework he is going to have someone to crib
from.
* Tayside North Tory MP Bill Walker sounded a note of exasperation
about the Tory candidate's latest gaffe. While still criticising the SNP
candidate and citing her Australian background and republicanism, he
said: ''We have got a situation where we have two candidates, from the
Conservative Party and SNP, who do not have deep local roots, either of
them. There is no minus or plus for either in my view.''

YESTERDAY, with Mr Major in Moscow for the Russian end of the VE Day
commemorations, the Commons turned up for what should be called Not
Prime Minister's Questions, an occasional event that has become one of
the great yawn-inducing rituals of British politics.
In the absence of the Prime Minister, Mr Tony Newton, the Leader of
the Commons, is sent in to defend the Government. His performances are
what they should be: safe, worthy, uneventful. Why anyone bothers to
turn up is a mystery.
Tony Blair takes his lead from Mr Major and sends in his deputy, John
Prescott, to front for Labour. Yesterday he arrived to cheers from his
side, clutching his script in a see-through red platic folder.
Mr Prescott has been known to stray when he speaks, a charming
characteristic now strictly forbidden under New Labour.
With three minutes to spare, he had plenty of time to ease his
statesman suit -- dark, single-breasted, near-tasteful tie -- into the
green leather of the Front Bench, with a hip waggle to clear his
colleagues and make some room.
When he last appeared on behalf of Mr Blair, Mr Prescott was
congratulated by the critics for his skill in delivering his prepared
questions complete with verbs and laboured emphasis all in the right
place.
This time, he proved he has mastered Lesson Two in political
stagecraft: the carefully-timed gesture. The question: ''Does he accept
that Thursday's local election results were a disaster for the Tories
and a triumph for Labour?'' was accompanied by dramatic pointing
gestures fore and aft: speech and movement in one telegenic package.
Mr Newton tried to hit back with an equally prepared but completely
garbled example of Labour duplicity involving quotes from two newspaper
articles. It didn't work. The few cheers from his side sounded
distinctly puzzled.
Mr Prescott returned by asking if Mr Newton agreed with Tory MP Sir
Rhodes Boyson, the north London MP who is threatening to oppose the
Government in today's debate on London hospital services, that the
Government should stop lecturing and start listening to the British
people?
The point about Tory disunity made, Mr Prescott then read out his
version of New Labour's foolproof, multi-purpose soundbite: ''(insert
example of Government policy) proves you can never trust the Tories on
(insert issue) again.''
After that, Mr Newton was in no mood for olive branches.
Mr David Steel, for the Liberal Democrats, tried to enlist his support
for the West Highland sleeper by appealing to him as ''a regular visitor
to Scotland''. Would he ensure the Government finds money to keep the
service running?
Mr Newton, an English MP after all, was not having it. He was clearly
not prepared to take any suggestion that he might harbour sympathies for
Scotland. He was just passing through. ''He is rather exaggerating my
activities as a tourist in Scotland. I do recall meeting him at a fete
in his own constituency a couple of years ago.''
The rest of the soporific quarter-of-an-hour faded into day-dreams.
References were made to how wonderful the Queen was for waving to her
subjects, to how wonderful the French were for not electing another
socialist, to how wonderful Swindon is for Tory businessmen.
In the ebb and flow of predictable questions and answers, the mind
wandered and the gaze was drawn to the Government Front Bench to watch
Ministers pass the time.
Tory chairman Jeremy Hanley picked his fingers. Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang and his Minister George Kynoch whispered behind the Speaker's chair
while waiting to hear the announcement on the future of Scottish
Nuclear.
Somewhere in the distance the same phrases came up again and again:
''does my Right Honourable Friend not agree'', ''export volumes up'',
''discredited Government'', ''will cost us jobs'', ''that lot
opposite'', ''deceit''. Who said what is difficult to say.

SCOTTISH Opposition MPs reacted angrily yesterday to the plans for the
future of Scottish Nuclear, with fresh claims that paper guarantees were
being given to the workforce north of the Border.
However the Tories, including former Scottish Office Minister Allan
Stewart and Ayr MP Phil Gallie, reacted positively to the statement, in
which Trade President Michael Heseltine underlined the promise of price
cuts.
Supporting the Government, Mr Stewart, MP for Eastwood, ''warmly
welcomed'' the proposals, accusing Scottish Labour MPs of displaying a
''neanderthal, knee-jerk reaction'' to them. Mr Gallie welcomed the
prospect that the privatisation would bring new jobs to Scotland,
possibly with more to come.
In his statement, Mr Heseltine concentrated heavily on the abolition
of the fossil fuel levy in England and Wales, which would mean that
electricity prices there would fall by up to 8% in a full year.
He claimed that comparable arrangements would be put in hand in
Scotland, where the nuclear premium would be ended and the savings
passed through to franchise customers in Scotland.
Due to these and other savings already in train, domestic electricity
prices in Scotland would fall by about 8% in real terms between 1994 and
1996. The Trade Secretary also drew attention to the apparent job
guarantees to Scotland, expected to bring at least 100 jobs.
He claimed: ''The proposals I have announced today will make for a
more competitive nuclear generation sector operating to continuing,
rigorous safety standards. They will strengthen the ability of British
companies to market nuclear services abroad.
''This is the right way forward for this key industry. At the same
time, the changes in the fossil fuel levy and the equivalent step in
Scotland will bring significant benefits to consumers.''
Opposition spokesmen took a different view. Shadow Trade Secretary
Jack Cunningham told Mr Heseltine: ''Your statement could be succinctly
summed up as: the private sector gets a cut-price bargain, the taxpayer
gets the bill.''
He continued: ''Does not your statement make clear that the short-term
political objectives of a discredited Cabinet lie behind the
Government's decision to privatise the nuclear industry, not the
interests of taxpayers or consumers, let alone the employees of the
industries themselves?
''The statement has nothing to do with long-term energy policy or how
best to introduce competition, but seeks to maximise revenue to the
Treasury before the next election.''
On the future for Scotland, he warned: ''Is not the likelihood, indeed
the certainty, that this company will maintain a London office going to
undermine any pretence that it is going to be managed from Edinburgh?
''Isn't that the reality and the experience of people in Scotland in
respect of BritOil and Guiness, just to take two recent examples? Is it
not clear from the rout of the Tories in the local elections in Scotland
and England that nuclear industry communities have no confidence in Tory
Party policies, whether in this industry or any other aspect of
Government policy?''
Mr Heseltine replied that Labour had no agreed policy on nuclear
energy and, on Scotland, and insisted that Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
had won a range of safeguards and conditions.
''The headquarters will be in Scotland. It will be enshrined for a
minimum of 10 years, and after that without any repeal unless somebody
does something about it.
''So there is built into the proposals a cast-iron undertaking to the
Scottish people about the intentions of this Government.''
As Scots tempers began to fray, Labour's Adam Ingram (East Kilbride)
said the announcement had borne out speculation last week which had
''united all political parties in Scotland and provoked a furious
reaction from the business community.
''The people who work at Scottish Nuclear headquarters in my
constituency will not believe any of the assurances given by you
today,'' he said.
Mr Heseltine said Labour allegations about what people did and did not
believe lacked intellectual credibility. Labour had warned wrongly that
previous privatisations would be unpopular and destroy jobs, and it had
now been forced to ''tear the party apart'' by rewriting Clause 4 on
nationalisation.
Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian -- Lab.) said his constituents at
Torness did not want to be privatised, and certainly did not want to be
''shunted into a sham holding company which would inevitably be
dominated by its larger partner.''
He said the #20 cut in electricity bills promised in England was a
''bribe,'' and demanded if consumers in Scotland would get the same
deal.
Mr Heseltine said similar ''significant'' reductions would take place,
but electricity prices in Scotland were already some 10% below English
prices.
From the SNP benches, party leader Alex Salmond said the Government's
proposals were a ''madcap privatisation.'' He warned: ''Given the
experience of companies such as Guinness, which made commitments which
were broken, of British Gas and British Steel, where commitments were
made as part of a privatisation and then broken, and of BritOil, where
there was a golden share, why should anyone in Scotland have any
confidence in Tory promises, paper guarantees or golden shares that turn
to base metal?''
Mr Heseltine emphasised that Mr Lang would have a share jointly with
him in respect of the holding company and individually in respect of the
Scottish division to ensure proper safeguards.'' He insisted the
Scottish Secretary had ''persuasively argued to achieve a range of
safeguards.

LABOUR left-winger Dennis Skinner was ordered out of the Commons
yesterday after accusing Ministers of a ''crooked deal'' over the coal
industry sell-off.
Speaker Betty Boothroyd said he would not be allowed to return for the
rest of the day.
She told him: ''I think you have used parliamentary language and
accusations which are unacceptable.''
Miss Boothroyd first asked him to rephrase his comments to President
of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine, during exchanges on the
Minister's announcement of the privatisation of much of the nuclear
power industry.
However, the MP for Bolsover referred to a recent BBC TV Panorama
programme claiming that Richard Budge, the man involved in buying most
of Britain's working mines during the sell-off, had been under
investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Panorama reported on May 1 that accountants Coopers and Lybrand had
considered some dealings by Mr Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining,
while he was a director of his brother's firm A F Budge to be ''in
contravention of the Companies Act''.
The programme said Mr Heseltine did not take action as Mr Budge had
been named the ''preferred bidder'' in the race to buy three English
regions of British Coal.
Panorama suggested that with no reserve bidder, privatisation could
have been jeopardised if Mr Budge had faced disqualification as a
director.
Mr Skinner, raising the issue yesterday, said: ''This Government that
has privatised rain is now privatising radiation.
''What guarantee have we got that you won't do the same trick you
pulled with the coal industry and organise a shabby deal with one of
your Tory friends to sell off that industry to R J Budge.''
He challenged Mr Heseltine: ''Will you give a guarantee that on this
occasion you won't engage in a crooked deal ...
''What guarantees have we got that the same thing won't apply again?''
Miss Boothroyd said: ''I think you have used parliamentary language
and accusations which are unacceptable in this House.
''We are not on Panorama in this House thank goodness! I would be
grateful if you would rephrase what you have just said.''
Miss Boothroyd added: ''I cannot accept what you are saying. If you
would wish to rephrase it of course I will accept what you are saying
and call on the Secretary of State to make some response.''
Mr Skinner: ''I have no intention of withdrawing the fact that this
Government engaged in a crooked deal in order to sell off the English
part of the coal industry to R J Budge, one of their Tory friends, a
director who had been discredited before that sale took place.''
Miss Boothroyd: ''If that is the case I think I must ask if you will
withdraw yourself from this House for the remainder of this day's
sitting ...
''I order you to withdraw immediately from the House for the remainder
of this day's sitting.''
As Mr Skinner left a shout was heard from the Tory benches ''New
Labour!''.

<HEADLINE>Labour faces union row on minimum wage</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

LABOUR was on a collision course with the unions yesterday as the
party leadership backed off from setting a level for its proposed
minimum wage before the next General Election.
Union leaders want a guaranteed low of about #4-an-hour written into
the party manifesto, based on average earnings.
However, Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman yesterday
signalled that no decision would be taken until Labour was in government
-- and even then the figure might be determined by prices rather than
earnings.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, said a further suggestion of allowing employers a say in
setting the figure would be ''like asking Dracula to take charge of the
blood bank''.
Employment Minister Phillip Oppenheim accused Labour of wanting to
''have their cake and eat it'' by offering an attractive policy but
refusing to set out its consequences.
The issue currently is being studied by the party's economic
commission chaired by shadow chancellor Gordon Brown, which is expected
to report next month.
Ms Harman yesterday said Labour remained committed to tackling the
scandal of low pay -- but refused to put a figure on it.
''We are considering how best in government we actually fix the level
of minimum wage,'' she said on BBC Radio 4.
''We are looking at how other countries do it. It's a matter of
consensus in other countries. Unions are tied into the process of fixing
it as are employers, together with Government.''
Mr Morris said it was the firm view of TGWU members that the only way
to relieve poverty in work was to set the minimum wage at #4.
''It seems to me that if we are to go around asking employers as to
exactly what the minimum wage should be, it would be like asking Dracula
to take charge of the blood bank,'' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at
One.
However, TGWU leadership challenger Jack Dromey, Ms Harman's husband
and a close ally of Labour leader Tony Blair, said the party would not
be in a position to deliver a firm target figure until after the
election.
''We should be clear what we want. We should get on with the trade
union job in the short term of achieving an end to poverty pay and then
get a commitment from the Labour Party as to what they should do in
Government,'' he said.
The Labour left signalled its opposition to the party going into an
election without setting out its plans in detail.
Nottingham South MP Alan Simpson warned: ''It is a no win situation.
If we don't set a figure it leaves it open to all the worst forms of
speculation and Tory scaremongering.''
The Government remains convinced that the policy could turn into an
electoral millstone for Labour. It insists a minimum wage would force up
employers' costs and cut jobs.
In the Commons, Employment Secretary Michael Portillo yesterday
reiterated warnings that joblessness would rise if a future Labour
government imposed a national minimum wage.
Speaking at Question Time, he said: ''The countries where the levels
of unemployment are highest are those where they have adopted and
applied the national minimum wage.
''This is the policy the Labour Party wants to impose upon this
country and it would have the same result of destroying jobs, in
particular for our young people.''

THE Lords last night backed Government plans to toughen the rules
under which children in Scotland can be taken into care and to redefine
the duties of parents and children, following the Orkney and Fife child
care inquiries.
The Children (Scotland) Bill, which has already cleared the Commons,
gained its second reading without a vote, according to the custom of the
Upper House.
Opening the debate earlier, Scottish Office Minister of State Lord
Fraser of Carmyllie said the Bill was a ''major milestone in Scottish
children's legislation''.
He told peers: ''It defines the responsibilities and rights of
parents.
''It promotes the welfare of children, improves the protection of
children and brings the adoption law up to date.''
Lord Fraser said the Bill reflected the Government's ''central belief
that children are best looked after by their parents''.
Lord Macaulay of Bragar, for the Opposition, offered Labour's general
support for the Bill.
However, he warned that fresh attempts might be made to outlaw
parental use of the cane, belt or whip against children in Scotland,
following the defeat of such a move in the Commons.
Social worker the Earl of Mar and Kellie, for the Liberal Democrats,
commended the measure as ''much heralded and welcomed''.
Lord Hope of Craighead, who is Lord Justice-General of Scotland and
Lord President of the Court of Session, said he ''warmly supported'' the
Bill, despite having minor reservations about its detail.
Lord Hope, in a maiden speech, told peers: ''Scotland can look forward
into the next century with confidence that it has a system of family law
which is in keeping with the needs of modern society.
''The cases which have caused concern have resulted in personal
tragedy for many people who are particularly vulnerable.
''But the clock cannot be turned back in these cases . . .
''What we can and must do is to learn from the mistakes and, by all
means possible, strive to avoid anything like that happening in the
future.''

If you ever yearned to get away from most of it, this could be your
chance...
POP stars love them because of their seclusion; millionaires like
Richard Branson like to collect them. Islands have a magic all of their
own, although the locals who live on them are often less than impressed
by the comic singers and financial conjurers who buy the ground from
under their feet.
The sale of the island of Scarp in the Outer Hebrides is expected to
generate international interest, especially since the price is very low.
But it is a difficult place to get to. Its location off the west coast
of Harris means that it is remote even from Stornoway airport.
Access to the 2,488-acre island is by boat from the Harris to the
island's private landing pier. Scarp provides a variety of landscape,
ranging from the rugged coastline to the fertile land around the
derelict former school house which sits at the south east end of the
island.
Landowners often like to earn an income from their investment, but the
opportunities on Scarp are strictly limited.
About 127 acres of the land is under the tenure of 16 crofts,
producing an annual income of #47.35 - although no crofter now actually
lives on the island. The remainder of Scarp is subject to common
grazings and there are two lochs which, if stocked, could provide
fishing.
The title to the island specifically excludes its use for the
accommodation of holiday visitors or tourists.
Around 1900 there were 32 families on Scarp, and the population was
120. Today it is uninhabited, the last of the resident crofters having
left in December 1971.
Scarp was the site of an ill-fated experiment to deliver mail by
rocket. In a homespun version of Rockets Galore, the inventor Gerhardt
Zucher tried to fire the mail at the mainland in July 1934.
According to Derek Cooper's The Road to Mingulay (Routledge &amp; Kegan
Paul, 1985), ''the hollow rocket was loaded with letters and parcels.
There were four addressed to King George V, a keen philatelist, and one
from the Harris branch of the British Legion to the Prince of Wales.
''To test the inventor's claim that medicine could be carried if
securely wrapped,'' reported the Stornoway Gazette, ''it was decided to
send a bottle of cod liver oil to the twins at Scarp, whose fame has
gone abroad in many lands. There was also an envelope with a 1[1/2]d
rocket stamp, addressed to Sir Godfrey Collins, which carried two prime
Scalpay herring and a note exhorting the Secretary of State to eat more
herring and persuade the rest of Britain to do the same...
''The crowd watched closely, eager to see the mail shoot forward on
its journey to the mainland of Harris. The button was touched, there was
a dull explosion and a flash of fire.
''For a second, smoke obscured everything but, when it cleared the
firing apparatus was seen in ruins on the beach; the steel rocket in the
midst torn and twisted and the letters strewn about the sand, many of
them charred and burnt. Someone in the crowd laughed.''
To the delight of the philatelists, the experiment was not repeated.
The twins, for whom the cod liver oil was intended, were born in
January of 1934 to Mrs Christina Maclennan. The first child was born on
Saturday 14th in her home on Scarp, the second two days later, in Lewis
Hospital. Thus the twins were born on different islands, in different
counties and different weeks!
Savills are asking for offers in excess of #75,000 and expect
worldwide interest. Applications by first-class post, rather than by
rocket mail, are recommended.

THE Northern Ireland peace process takes another historic step today
with the first official meeting between a Government Minister and Sinn
Fein.
More than eight months after the IRA declared its ceasefire, Mr
Michael Ancram, the Minister in charge of political development in
Northern Ireland, will meet a delegation led by Sinn Fein's Martin
McGuinness at Stormont.
Mr Ancram said yesterday that early movement by Sinn Fein on the
question of the IRA's arms would be a significant gesture but there are
no signs that this is likely to be the case.
The Government claims the ''decommissioning'' of terrorist weapons
will be at the top of the agenda, while Sinn Fein places the issue as
only one of many to be discussed.
Today's meeting was placed in doubt after street violence in
Londonderry last week during the Prime Minister's visit to the city.
Mr Major, attending the VE ceremony in Moscow yesterday, held talks
with the Irish Prime Minister, Mr John Bruton, and confirmed that Mr
Ancram would meet Mr McGuinness today.
In Londonderry last night, Sinn Fein staged another protest rally
despite calls from more moderate nationalists for restraint, amid fears
that recent street disturbances could risk Ulster's new-found peace.
Sinn Fein is pressing for full political recognition by which it means
its inclusion in talks with other political parties on a future
settlement. However, this seems a long way off and the Government is set
to demand concessions on the question of IRA weapons, in return for more
recognition of Sinn Fein's position.
Mr Ancram said yesterday that he and Sinn Fein had much to learn from
one another but he required ''substantial progress'' on the
decommissioning of weapons.
He accepted that Sinn Fein would wish to raise other issues such as
the release of prisoners.
The atmosphere at today's meeting is expected to be cool with no overt
signs of cordiality, since the two sides are extremely far apart. The
Government is also annoyed at Sinn Fein's increasing street militancy
and its warnings of protest marches over the coming summer.
This issue was also raised by the deputy Irish Premier, Mr Dick
Spring, who called for a halt to all parades and protests in Northern
Ireland during the so-called ''marching season'' in an attempt to
encourage the peace process.
Mr Spring said only the British and Irish Governments could direct
signposts pointing the way forward but only the two traditions in
Northern Ireland, Protestant and Catholic, free of coercion or pressure,
could agree on the solution.
Mr Spring, referring to imminent planned marches by both the loyalist
and nationalists in Ulster, said: ''I have often thought how significant
a step it would be if both traditions, just for a year, called a
voluntary moratorium on all forms of protest during this period in order
to encourage further a spirit of reconciliation.''
However, the reconciliation may still be a step away. Mr McGuinness
will argue at today's talks that Sinn Fein is being treated like a
second-class party and should be afforded full negotiating status.
A sign of the difficulties ahead came after a meeting between an
Ulster Unionist delegation and the Secretary of State Sir Patrick
Mayhew. The Unionists say they will no longer meet Mr Ancram as a result
of today's talks with Sinn Fein and are warily watching the outcome for
any sign of Government concessions, while the IRA arms issue remains
unresolved.
The Prime Minister last night urged Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams to
ensure that the talks succeed. He said last week's violence in
Londonderry had been organised. It was silly and he hoped that Sinn Fein
would learn that.
''Mr Adams has been saying for a long time that he would like to make
progress and see the peace talks proceed. Now he has the opportunity to
face the issues.''
Mr Major was speaking at the British Embassy in Moscow, after his
meeting with Mr Bruton.
The Irish Premier said that serious progress had to be made in the
talks about getting guns out of commission in Northern Ireland.
Decommissioning was not just a request of the two governments, but of
all the other political parties before they could sit down to all-party
talks.

MORE than seven million viewers tuned in to BBC1 as the Queen Mother,
the Queen, and Princess Margaret appeared on the Buckingham Palace
balcony yesterday, according to early figures.
However, an EastEnders special showing how Albert Square celebrated
the anniversary attracted nearly 12 million, while the BBC's coverage of
the Queen lighting a beacon at Hyde Park, The Nation Celebrates, was
watched by almost 11 million.
Call Up The Stars, a concert featuring contemporary performers
including Maureen Lipman and Max Bygraves paying tribute to their
wartime heroes, had an audience of more than eight million.
''The nation joined in with VE Day celebrations on TV even if they
couldn't go to Hyde Park or Pall Mall,'' said a BBC spokeswoman.
The 40% audience share for VE Day programmes meant that entire
families had tuned in, not just the older generation, she added.
Almost 13 million viewers watched the first of ITV's new series of
Prime Suspect on April 30. Scotland's Hamish Macbeth, on BBC1, was
watched by more than 8.5 million on the same evening.

<HEADLINE>Show of military might in Moscow after veterans of the Great Patriotic War parade to mark VE Day.  Russia marches, lest the world forgets</HEADLINE>

IT was a day when old men and women marched to cleberate VE Day . . .
and when young men marched to remind the world that the Russian bear
still has teeth even if its claws have been clipped.
The Soviet Union may be no more, but you would not have known it in
Red Square, as the veterans of the Great Patriotic War paraded to mark
VE Day, let alone at the unveiling of the stunning new war memorial
outside the city.
President Boris Yeltsin, having saluted the past in Red Square, staged
a military parade of which the Communist regime would have been proud to
mark the unveiling of the memorial.
It was a day when the Red Flag still flew.
Neither the Prime Minister nor President Clinton attended the military
parade, although they were present for the unveiling of the memorial and
the tour of the new war museum.
However, they would have had to be blind and deaf not to have seen
what had been going on. Mr Yeltsin had arranged the parade in which
10,000 troops, 253 tanks and a vast assortment of missiles and fighter
aircraft took part. At the climax, more fighters fired star shells high
over Moscow.
Earlier, the two Western leaders and their wives had stood at the side
of Lenin's tomb in Red Square to watch the parade of 5000 war veterans.
It was a very moving occasion, as the old men and women, some in
uniform, some in plain clothes, but all wearing a vast collection of
campaign medals, marched around the square past the President.
He reviewed them from the highest level of the granite tomb, the very
spot from which the old Communist leaders used to take the salute at the
traditional May Day Parade when they showed the world the might of the
Soviet army.
The army could not resist doing so yesterday.
After the veterans had marched slowly round the square, from the wings
squadrons of young crack troops came marching on.
The Defence Ministry later denied that any of them came from units
serving in Chechnya, but both Mr Major and President Clinton were at
least taken by surprise.
They had agreed to attend the parade under the impression that what
they would see would be old soldiers remembering the war.
In his speech, President Yeltsin said that Hitler's outrageous plans
had been to destroy Russia, its people, to demolish Moscow and put the
inhabitants into concentration camps.
''We defeated them and our country and Moscow is still here and will
be for ever,'' he added. ''Let us not forget Hitler's plans and what a
great price we had to pay to stop them.''
He said May 9 was a day of sacred remembrance for Russia.
''Let the memory of this war unite us again now,'' he said. ''My
advice to the Russian people and those of other countries is we must not
let the seed of Nazism grow again.''
It was a powerful speech, delivered in ringing tones, and it had an
impact. Some of the veterans in the crowd, too infirm to march, were in
tears.
However, Mr Yeltsin did not have it all his own way. After the
ceremony in Red Square had ended and the last troops marched off to the
1812 Overture, his enemies were assembling for a rival parade.
As the world leaders were taking it in turn to lay wreaths at the Tomb
Of The Unknown Soldier, a mile and a half away at the Belorussky
Station, at the far end of what used to be Gorky Street, 10,000
protesters were assembling for a march.
It was a strange mixture of Russian dissidents. There were old-style
Communists, Royalists, Fascists, anti-Semites and people who just
believe that Yeltsin has been bad for Russia.
Placards of Stalin, a non-person in Red Square, were on display, there
were red flags with the hammer and sickle, the flag of the Romanovs and
banners saying that Mr Yeltsin was Hitler's heir.
The parade proved peaceful and it ended outside the Lubyanka prison.
The organisers had hoped to get into Red Square but the authorities had
mounted a massive police presence and sealed it off.
But it was not just parades. Around the city, stages had been set up
and people were singing patriotic songs from them.
There were balloons and, in the evening, a display of decorated
floats. It all ended at 10 o'clock, with a fireworks display set off
from 33 sites ringing Moscow.
Mr Major, speaking at the war memorial complex, said that the Soviet
losses in the last war had been on a scale it was still hard to grasp
today. Civilian losses in Leningrad alone had exceeded the total British
military losses for the whole war.
Political leadership had passed to a generation too young to have
fought in that war and it faced, instead, the responsibility of peace.
''Having banished the divisions of the past, we must let not even the
shadow of a new division fall across Europe,'' he said. ''We need to
forge a chain of new relationships binding us together in a durable
peace.''
He did not mention the war in Chechnya but he did remind the Russians
that they shared a responsibility to spare people the suffering of
conflict within, as well as beyond, national borders.
It was about as far as he could go on a day in which Britain like the
United States and the other leaders here were merely bit players. This
was a Russian celebration and they staged proceedings in the most lavish
manner possible.
Earlier, the Prime Minister had a 40-minute meeting with President
Yeltsin in the Kremlin, at which they discussed the future expansion of
Nato. Mr Major reassured Mr Yeltsin there will be no rush to enrol the
Eastern European countries.
They also discussed the situation in Chechnya and Mr Major made clear
the concern held in Britain at the way Russia has handled the war.
Mr Yeltsin said they were now focusing on restoration and
reconstruction, security was being placed in the hands of the police,
and that there would be no escalation of military action.
The two leaders exchanged gifts of swords. President Yeltsin gave Mr
Major one to commemorate the wartime alliance with Britain, and received
in return a replica of the sword Mr Churchill gave to Stalin on behalf
of King George VI in 1943.

A WAR veteran who was one of the first to step ashore during the
liberation of Jersey turned the clock back yesterday to re-enact the
historic scene.
The first person who greeted him with a handshake 50 years ago was
there again.
To cheers and a spontaneous rendition of Land of Hope and Glory from
the watching crowd, 76-year-old Surgeon Captain Ron MacDonald, stepped
on to the jetty at the Channel island's capital St Helier to be met by
islander Mr Jack Le Gresley.
Recalling their first meeting, Mr Le Gresley said: ''With me there was
a farmer who spoke hardly any English. He took them by the hand and
said: 'How do you do' and then said 'You've been a bloody long time
getting here'.''
Mr MacDonald had come ashore with Sub Lieutenant David Milne from the
destroyer HMS Beagle, which was commanded by Lieutenant Commander
Douglas Williams.
Yesterday, Mr Williams, 81, was on board her modern counterpart when
it anchored at the same spot.
Mr MacDonald, who lives on the Isle of Wight, carried a Union Flag up
the steps as the crowd cheered.
Two officers, Lieutenant Rupert Forester-Bennett and Lieutenant Doug
Calkin, who helped renact the liberation scene, then draped the flag
from the window of the Harbour Master's office as happened 50 years ago
to ecstatic cheering from the islanders.
Mr MacDonald said: ''I was a bit immature then. I think I made a
simple remark like hello, and smiled and waved at the people.''
The Prince of Wales was in Guernsey for the 50th anniversary
celebrations of the liberation of the Channel Islands yesterday morning
and flew to Jersey in the afternoon.
Others attending the Jersey celebrations were members of Force 135 --
the task force which arrived to liberate the islands -- residents who
lived through the occupation, and prisoners who were detained on the
island.
Later, thousands of people crowded into Liberation Square and lined
the route from the airport for the Prince's arrival.
Prince Charles read a message from the Queen which said the islands'
day of liberation had been one of the most significant events in their
history.
''These oldest possessions of the Crown had endured five long dark
years before the Liberation restored the freedom we continue to cherish
and enjoy,'' continued the message.
The Queen said that, during visits to the island, she had been proud
to see that islanders had put ''those sad times'' behind them.
''With your traditional courage, loyalty, and devotion, you have
worked hard to build a better and happier future whilst maintaining your
ancient privileges and unique institutions,'' she said.
She urged that the contribution of the islanders who had volunteered
for military service and fought for the Allied victory should never be
forgotten, and concluded: ''It is right that we should remember past
events but it is my earnest desire that we continue to work towards a
time when all nations may live in peace and harmony.''
In Liberation Square, the Prince watched a re-enactment of the raising
of the Union flag at the Pomme d'Or Hotel, which during the war had been
taken over by the Germans as the headquarters for their naval forces.
He then unveiled a 17ft-high bronze sculpture by Philip Jackson, which
shows seven figures and a billowing flag to commemorate the end of the
Occupation.
The Prince walked through the crowd, stopping to shake hands with
well-wishers, before visiting a museum to see a tapestry which depicts
scenes from the Occupation.
Later, he attended a children's street party and unveiled a memorial
to residents who escaped from Jersey during the Occupation.
The Queen Mother was yesterday starting a well-earned spell of rest
and recuperation after her starring role in VE Day anniversary
celebrations.
She has no official engagements this week and, apart from any private
commitments, was expected to take it easy over the next few days.
Her appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony in front of a cheering
crowd of half a million was one of the crowning moments of the weekend
commemorations.
The Queen Mother, 94, stood unaided alongside the Queen and Princess
Margaret for nearly half-an-hour as she soaked up the atmosphere in The
Mall. She watched a flypast and reminisced as Dame Vera Lynn sang a
medley of wartime favourites.
Yesterday's appearance -- a moving flashback to the famous moment 50
years ago when, as the Queen, she joined King George VI on the balcony
on VE Day -- followed official engagements on each of the previous two
days of her hectic weekend of remembrance and thanksgiving.

THERE was a problem. When the Solicitors Estate Agency were getting
inquiries six years ago on suitable lettings they weren't sure about the
best people to recommend.
''So we set up things ourselves, as a back-up to our estate agency
service, and things have gone from there,'' says Jan Gorrie, rental
manager in Burnside of SEAL.
''Mostly, we are dealing with independent private landlords, and most
of the properties are on a six-month minimum lease,'' she adds. ''There
is quite a strong demand these days for a relatively short-term lease.''
Looking back, she finds important changes over the years. For one
thing, there is simply no suggestion today of any stigma in going for a
rented property. In fact, there is a clear trend towards rental by many
in the professional field.
''This is a market which meets lots of needs,'' Jan says. ''It is a
sensible move, when you haven't decided exactly where you want to stay.
Or you will be in an area for a relatively short time.
''People want to live in good property. And if they are letting, they
want their house to stay in good shape. That is where people like
ourselves come in. We provide the service that meets both needs.''
It might be, for example, a main door conversion in the West End,
providing comfortable family accommodation on three levels. There is a
large lounge, and a formal dining room, both on the main floor. Above
are two double-size bedrooms and a bathroom, and the ground floor has a
double bedroom, a nice large Victorian kitchen, bathroom and shower.
This is the kind of place that has the attractive features of ornate
plaster ceilings, stained glass windows and wood panelling, as well as
gas-fired central heating, double garage, and a pleasant garden. It's
going at #1100 a month, with entry from early July.
Also in the West End, there's another main door conversion, in a
detached stone-built villa. It has a large lounge, with a sitting/dining
room, three bedrooms, bathroom, shower room, large split-level dining
kitchen and utility room off.
It has gas-fired central heating and the use of a private garden area.
This particular property comes unfurnished, but the kitchen has all the
electrical goodies built in. Going price -- #750 a month.
Move out to Killearn, if you prefer the country life, of course. This
time a detached farmhouse is on offer. Renovated and refurbished
throughout, to a high-spec inventory. You get a formal lounge, a dining
room, a family room, three double bedrooms, and a single. A breakfasting
kitchen -- with Aga -- and a family bathroom, plus separate shower room
and a cloakroom.
There is gas-fired central heating, a garage and a large garden to
wander around. The sort of place that makes you think you've given up
the struggle in the city and gone back to proper civilisation. Say, #895
a month.

A DRUGS dealer caught with four illegal shotguns was jailed for a
total of 17 years at the High Court in Aberdeen yesterday.
Ronald Cormack, 38, a father of three, of The Square, Rosehearty,
Aberdeenshire, was found guilty of being concerned in the supplying of
ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, and cannabis between April 1993 and December
last year.
The jury also convicted Cormack of assaulting Essex builder Mr
Dharamjit Sahota last May at Hillhead of Potterton, by repeatedly
kicking and punching him on the head and body, compressing his throat,
placing a pistol against his head, forcing a bullet into his mouth, and
threatening to kill him.
Cormack was further convicted of illegally possessing three sawn-off
shotguns, a pump-action shotgun, a stun gun, and 148 rounds of
ammunition of various calibres.
A charge alleging he possessed a sub-machine gun had earlier been
dropped by the Crown.
The jury's majority verdicts followed a trial lasting nearly four
weeks, during which Mr Sahota told how Cormack made him chew a bullet
after putting a gun into his mouth following a dispute over money
allegedly owed to a third party.
Jailing Cormack, Lord Marnoch told him: ''I am satisfied that you were
heavily involved in all the drugs specified.'' The Judge noted that the
firearms and ammunition involved had been ''numerous and dangerous''.
The Crown yesterday made a motion for a drugs profits investigation
hearing on Cormack. This was fixed for July 7.

PRESTO, part of the Argyll Group which includes Safeway, is to close
27 stores, 18 of them in Scotland. A total of 400 jobs will go, around
250 of them in Scotland, although the company hopes that some staff
members will find jobs in new Presto and Safeway stores.
A spokeswoman for the company said the closure of the smaller, older
Presto stores was being carried out because they were no longer viable.
She added: ''The average number of staff employed in each of the 27
stores is 20 and the company hopes to relocate as many as possible,
although some compulsory redundancies may be necessary.''
Some of the Scottish stores set for closure employ as few as three
people, she said, although the store at Wester Hailes employs 59 staff.
''Scotland is a real stronghold for us and we will continue to build
new stores there. There is a new Safeway store opening in Airdrie in
July and another four Presto stores opening in the North of England and
Scotland. The chairman is Scottish and he is very much committed to our
business in Scotland,'' said the spokeswoman.
''We are hoping to transfer people where we can to their nearest store
but not everyone will choose to do that. We are also selling the leases
of the stores we are closing and want to sell them to other foodstores
and we will try to make sure that staff transfer with the leases,'' she
added.
Safeway is undertaking a major restructuring of its middle management
and has not discounted possible redundancies in that sector.
0   The Scottish stores which will close are: Alexandra Parade,
Glasgow; Baillieston, Glasgow; Barrhead, near Glasgow; Bearsden;
Bridgeton Cross, Glasgow; Campbeltown; Cumbernauld Road, Glasgow; Dalry,
Ayrshire; Dumbarton Road, Glasgow; Lairg, near Inverness; Lanark; Leith,
Edinburgh; Milngavie; Royston Road, Glasgow; Skye Crescent, Paisley;
Stevenston, Ayrshire; Tranent, Lothian; Wester Hailes, Edinburgh.

THERE are record numbers of students in Scottish higher education but
the graduate unemployment rate has fallen only slightly to nearly 10%,
the latest figures revealed yesterday .
There were more than 132,000 students in full-time higher education in
Scotland, according to 1993-4 undergraduate data from the Scottish
Office Education Department.
All but 15% are at HE institutions. The most popular subjects are
business and administration, followed by engineering and technology. The
proportion of female undergraduates has risen to 48%.
According to separate 1993 data covering what graduates and
below-degree diploma holders do after graduating, 9.9% were unemployed,
compared with 10.7% for 1992.
Graduates in the creative arts had the highest unemployment rate,
20.5%, while medicine and dentistry had the lowest, 0.5%.
Fewer went into industry but more secured employment in commerce and
become self-employed.
Perhaps reflecting employment prospects, the proportion of graduates
continuing in full-time study has risen to the highest level yet, nearly
30%. In the nine years to 1993, there has been a 144% increase in the
number of postgraduates.
However, of those gaining permanent employment, 73% remain in
Scotland, an increase of nearly 10% in four years. Fewer are leaving
Scotland to find work in the rest of the UK.

A LEADING council official yesterday accused a campaign group of
hi-jacking a publicity event which celebrated the opening of a new cycle
route.
Strathclyde roads director Donald Carruthers criticised cycling
activists for handing out literature critical of the path -- the first
phase of the Clydebank to Glasgow green commuter cycleway.
The embarrassing row broke out as comedians Rikki Fulton and Jack
Milroy were helping to launch the event at the Museum of Transport in
Glasgow.
Having to share the route with pedestrians was not what cyclists
wanted, said Mr Neil McDonald, full-time activist and Glasgow Cycling
Campaign spokesman.
Instead, the group is demanding that Strathclyde officials reduce road
space for vehicles by building on-road cycle routes, similar to those in
Holland and Belgium.
However, Mr Carruthers was not amused by the group's actions,
representatives of whom had been formally invited to the launch.
He said: ''I'm pretty disgusted. They don't seem to realise when
people are trying to help them.
''We are the only department within the regional council trying to
change the ethos of transport. And they are distracting from what we are
trying to do here today.''
Campaign group vice-chairman Mr McDonald hit back: ''If the region
does not want criticism, then they should get it right in the first
place. This pathway is on the pavement, it is bitty and doesn't bring us
up to Euro standards.
''In Edinburgh, you can find cycle routes only a stone's throw from
where you are standing in the city. But in Glasgow, Strathclyde roads
department have been spending the past 30 years trying everything
possible to make traffic move quicker. In 1965, they even proposed
putting up a double-deck expressway along Great Western Road.''
Glasgow's millennium plan includes 12 kilometres of designated cycle
routes within the city centre. A two-way cycle route has been marked out
for Sauchiehall Street, with kerbing to separate it from the road.
Strathclyde cycling officer Errol Wilkie was stunned at the actions of
the campaigners, claiming they were familiar with the region's proposals
prior to the press launch.
He said: ''The pathway came as no surprise to them. They've never
voiced disagreement before. This is a bit like biting the hand that
feeds you.''

<HEADLINE>Security van cash 'set on fire by cutting equipment'.  #1m up in smoke in robbery, court told</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978469100</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MASKED gang set fire to more than #1m as they tried to pull off what
would have been Britain's biggest cash robbery, a court heard yesterday.
Coughing and spluttering, they were forced to flee empty-handed as
bundles of bank notes turned into ''a horrendously expensive bonfire''
after they allegedly burned a hole in the side of an armoured van.
The court heard that a member of the gang had earlier forced the
17-tonne Securicor van -- en route to the Midlands from the TSB bank in
Southampton, Hampshire -- to drive down a country lane.
When the #80,000 truck, carrying more than #11m in notes, arrived at
the hamlet of Crawley, near Winchester, it was met by men wearing
balaclavas.
Guy Boney, QC, prosecuting, told Winchester Crown Court: ''That day
six men took part in an attempt to pull off the biggest cash robbery in
British criminal history.
''Their target was a Securicor van that one can say was bulging with
money.
''It was a large, heavily-armoured vehicle which looked like something
from another age -- a motoring version of Jurassic Park. As these men
found out to their cost, it was not very easy to get into.
''The van contained a prize worth taking a risk for -- bank notes to
the value of #11,389,500.''
Mr Boney said that a gang member had called the van on a mobile phone
as it drove along the A34 north of Winchester.
''The two occupants, Securicor employees, were told that there was a
bomb under their van,'' he added.
''They were told that unless they turned off the next sliproad that
they, the van and the money would be blown sky-high.''
''You won't be surprised to hear that they did turn off. At this stage
there were cars in front of and behind them, so in effect they were the
meat in the middle of a car sandwich.''
The convoy drove down a country road to a wooded clearing a mile east
of Crawley.
Mr Boney added: ''As soon as they arrived sheets of lead were thrown
over the top of the van to prevent any emergency signal being
transmitted.
''The men then used very high-powered cutting equipment to cut a
rectangular hole.
''High-powered it certainly was. The temperature reached several
thousand degrees Centigrade.
''They managed to open up the van like a can of pilchards -- but they
also produced an expensive bonfire.
''Between #1 million and #1.5 million worth of notes were reduced to
ashes or badly damaged by the fire.
''The van was on fire and things were going badly wrong. By this time
the whole operation was slipping out of control.
''A fortune in money was burning merrily away, sending smoke rising
into the air. The gang panicked and ran away.''
Some members drove cross-country in a getaway car, which was
discovered four hours later after it had been set alight at an
industrial estate.
Mr Boney added: ''The six men in the dock are not accused of robbery
because they were not successful in pulling it off.''
The men are accused of conspiracy to rob #11.4 million on March 1 last
year.
They are: Unemployed Wolfgang Schmelz, 44, of Bishopstoke, co-driver
of the Securicor van John Clapperton, 56, of Shirley, Southampton, and
car trader Gary Davis, 35, of Totton, all Hampshire.
Also accused are electrician Edgar Duell, 33, of Dibden, unemployed
Dalbir Rathor, 26, of Portswood, both in Southampton, and diver Glen
Cooke, 35, of Southsea, Hampshire.
All deny the charges.
Mr Boney said the gang had included the Securicor van driver John
Clapperton in the deal to buy themselves more time.
Mr Clapperton did not press a panic button in the Securicor truck
until it had been driven to the wooded clearing and was stationary, 12
minutes after the hijack began, the jury was told.
Mr Boney said: ''It was very important to the gang that the van's
panic button was not pressed until the last possible moment. The only
way of doing that is by cutting the driver in on the deal.''
The trial continues.

BARRIERS which stop people believing in the Christian faith are many
and varied, it has been found by a Church of Scotland committee which
will report to the General Assembly in Edinburgh this month.
The Mission and Evangelism Resources Committee says in its report,
published today that much depends on factors such as age and previous
experience of Christians and Christianity.
''It seems that in an increasing number of cases, people have had
little exposure to Christianity at all and have only the vaguest ideas
about it.''
The committee says its findings challenge all members of the Kirk to
consider how they can stimulate people's interest, challenge their
apathy and indifference, answer their questions, expose the bankruptcy
of modern secularism, and give a reason for the hope Christians have.
''Together we must seek God's help in presenting His message in a way
that is culturally relevant today.''
The committee received comments from 33 of the Kirk's 46 Scottish
presbyteries in a survey. Barriers to belief fell into four categories:
* Lack of any sense of need of what Christianity claims to offer.
* The secular climate of our time.
* ''Intellectual'' problems.
* The Church's life -- its representatives, service, history, and
building.
One of the main barriers is that many people feel no need.
''Ignorance, apathy, and self-sufficiency form powerful barriers.''
Several presbyteries mentioned a lack of knowledge, especially among
young people: ''Increasing numbers of people are very ignorant about
even the basic story of Jesus's life, teaching, death, and
resurrection.''
This ignorance factor was one of the significant findings of the
survey and was one the Church needed to take seriously. ''Perhaps some
of the Church's traditional reaction to this ignorance has been to
criticise people but it would be better if we were to take it seriously
and seek to find new ways of telling the story again -- without jargon
or in-talk.''
West Lothian Presbytery identified self-sufficiency as a general
attitude in society today, ''where people feel they can get by very well
on their own without any need for religious faith''.
Edinburgh Presbytery found ''a climate of opinion hostile or
indifferent to Christian belief and ethics'' and ''a fairly widespread
assumption that science has disproved the Christian faith''.
Ardrossan Presbytery said people's aims were material and religion
came in only when hopes were dashed. It blamed the media for subtly
undermining Christian beliefs and values.
Perth Presbytery said that many replies, especially among the teens
and twenties, indicated ''the confused message of the Church of Scotland
re statements on the virgin birth and homosexuality''.
The Church's services were described in many replies as ''boring'',
and also old-fashioned and irrelevant. Others said the teaching was
dogmatic and the atmosphere was ''stuffy, pompous, and out of touch with
the young''.
Several presbyteries gave the cost of commitment as another
significant barrier to belief.
Glasgow Presbytery found that 44 out of 208 people said nothing would
encourage them to be Christians.

A SHARP rise in cot deaths in Scotland over the first three months of
this year has reversed the steady downward trend over the past five
years.
The Scottish Cot Death Trust, which announced the figures yesterday,
said there was no obvious explanation for the upturn but the biggest
single factor in cot death continues to be smoking by parents.
The corresponding January-March figures had fallen from 34 in 1991 to
26 in 1992, to 18 in 1993, and 10 last year; this year, 16 babies died.
The figures were announced at the beginning of the trust's National
Cot Death Appeal, aimed at raising public support for research into the
syndrome.
Director Hazel Brooke said: ''We don't want to be alarmist but the
sharp drop in previous years may have fuelled the perception that the
problem is disappearing and we want to remind people that it is still
there.''
Time will tell if the upturn is simply a statistical blip on the steep
downward trend, or if in fact the underlying trend is levelling off.
''It wasn't a particularly hard winter and there is no evidence to
link cot death with other illnesses that are on the increase, such as
asthma,'' said Mrs Brooke.
Deaths during the winter months tend to be double those for the summer
and this proportion has remained more or less constant in Scotland, even
as the overall figures have fallen.
The drop to date has been attributed to a Government campaign
encouraging parents to put their babies to sleep on their back or side,
rather than face down, not to expose them to cigarette smoke, and not
let them get too warm.
Recent research supported by the trust tends to refute suggestions
that antimony vapour from fireproofed cot mattresses is to blame.
''Few parents are now putting their babies face down but smoking is
certainly a risk factor -- the risk increases seven-fold when the mother
smokes, and nine-fold when both parents smoke,'' said Mrs Brooke.

THE alleged victim of a head-butt by former Rangers football player
Duncan Ferguson told Glasgow Sheriff Court yesterday that he thought the
incident was ''just a clash of heads'' after a challenge for the ball.
Mr John McStay, 29, who at the time was playing for Raith Rovers, was
warned from the bench and by the prosecutor on the dangers of
prevarication and perjury and reminded he had taken an oath.
Mr Ferguson, who now plays for Everton, denies assaulting Mr McStay
during a match at Ibrox in Glasgow on April 16 last year.
Mr McStay told how he and Mr Ferguson had tussled and pulled at each
other as they both went for the same ball about 35 minutes into the
game. The referee's whistle had blown for a foul and, as Mr McStay
turned around, his head clashed with the Ranger's player's, cutting his
upper lip.
When asked by depute fiscal Mr Alasdair Youngson whether he thought
the clash of heads was an accident at the time, Mr McStay replied:
''No.'' he then added: ''We were going to square up to each other and we
just clashed.''
It was at this point that Mr McStay received the first of a number of
warnings. Sheriff Alexander Eccles reminded him that he had taken an
oath. The Sheriff added: ''Do you know what prevarication is? Avoiding
an answer in court. It is a contempt of court and is a serious offence.
Bear that in mind.''
Mr McStay was again warned by Sheriff Eccles, this time on the
consequences of perjury, just before the fiscal Mr Youngson read out a
statement Mr McStay was said to have made to a senior police officer in
May last year.
The statement said: ''The game was fairly uneventful until midway
through the first half. At this time I got involved in a tussle for the
ball with Duncan Ferguson of Rangers. There was a pull on me by Duncan
Ferguson and then a bit of arm wrestling and tussling.
''I heard the referee blow the whistle and realised he had decided to
stop the game. A small gap emerged between Duncan Ferguson and me. I
knew the referee had given a free kick to Raith Rovers.
''Before I could do anything further Duncan Ferguson, who by this time
was in front of me, suddenly lunged at me and head-butted me on the
mouth.
''He never said anything as he butted me. I fell to the ground
clutching my head. The blow was a fair old blow and I felt severe pain
in my lip.
''As I lay on the ground I felt my mouth and saw it was bleeding. I
was completely shocked by what Duncan Ferguson did.''
McStay agreed with Mr Youngson that the statement was true. Mr
Youngson then asked him: ''Were you describing to that police officer an
accident or a deliberate action? How would you define it?'' Said Mr
McStay: ''I have already said, a clash.''
McStay was asked why, if it was accidental, he had said to the police
he was completely shocked by what Ferguson did. He replied: ''Because of
what happened.'' Mr Youngson then asked: ''What is your evidence
today?'' To which Mr Mr McStay replied: ''We clashed on the field.''
Mr McStay was then shown TV video film of the incident and asked to
describe it. He said: ''A game of football, a tussle for the ball and a
clash of heads.''
Mr Youngson asked him if he now thought it was accidental and was
told: 'I don't know if it was accidental. It's hard to say. Contact was
made.''
Cross-examined by Mr Ferguson's defence counsel, Mr John Baird, Mr
McStay agreed that a newspaper photograph looked as if the Ibrox striker
was actually pushing him away. He also agreed that sometimes players
deliberately took a dive or feigned an incident to get another player
into trouble.
Referring to an earlier statement Mr McStay had made to the Sheriff,
Mr Baird said: ''The suggestion is that some people might be going
around saying that there was no contact and you throw yourself onto the
ground.
''All you were saying is that you will not have anyone going around
saying there wasn't contact between you. If you went down to the ground
it was as a result of contact that was made.''
Mr Baird then asked: ''In the whole circumstances of the constantly
changing movement between the two players, the actual incident of
contact between your head and Ferguson's head might have been
accidental?'' Mr McStay replied: ''Possible.''
Earlier, Raith Rover's physiotherapist, Mr Gerard Docherty, 33,
claimed that Mr McStay had told him as he tended the player: ''He has
done me.''
Under cross-examination, Mr Docherty was asked if the contact between
the two players might have been accidental. He replied: ''I suppose it
is possible.'' Under re-examination by Mr Youngson, he was asked, after
looking at a photograph, what he thought of the incident and replied:
''It looks like he is holding him and it is deliberate.''
Referees' supervisor Mr Michael Delaney, 56, said he had watched the
match from the main stand at Ibrox and witnessed the incident. ''The
players separated and the Ranger's number 10 head butted the Raith
Rovers' number two, Mr McStay, in the face.''
Mr Delaney said that in his opinion, Mr Ferguson should have been sent
off: ''I would have expected the referee to order Mr Ferguson from the
field of play for violent conduct.''
The match referee, Mr Kenneth Clark, 33, said he had blown his whistle
for a foul, turned to indicate which side had been awarded the free
kick, and did not see the alleged incident.
After watching the video recording in court, Mr Clark said that if he
had seen it at the time, he would have ordered Ferguson off for violent
conduct.
The trial continues.

THE driver of a bus whichcrashed into a bridge in Glasgow, killing
three Guides and two of their leaders, was yesterday sacked by his
employers.
Coach firm Clydeside 2000 said in a brief statement that Campbell
Devlin had been dismissed for gross misconduct ''in connection with the
accident in West Street''.
The company said it could not comment further, since Devlin, 30, of
Rannoch Street, Cathcart, had the right to appeal under its disciplinary
procedure.
In March, he was convicted of careless driving at the time of the
accident in September last year. Sheriff Archibald Bell fined him #750
and added nine penalty points to his driving licence.
However, Devlin may yet face the threat of civil action by relatives
of the crash victims, who were aggrieved that a jury cleared him of a
charge of dangerous driving, which carries a maximum jail sentence of
five years.
The court had heard that the Guides, from the Drumchapel area of
Glasgow, were on their way back from a Sunday outing to Butlin's
Wonderwest World at Ayr when the accident happened.
Devlin failed to see two warning signs and misjudged the height of the
rail bridge over West Street, which had been the scene of many previous
collisions. The roof of his bus was ripped off by the force of the
impact.
Sheriff Bell said Devlin had since suffered mental anguish and was
receiving counselling. At his trial, the jury heard how, after viewing
the carnage of the upper deck, he had held his head and said: ''Oh no .
. . Oh God.''
The dead and dying were Guide leaders Mrs Robina Dougall, 47, of Boon
Drive; Mrs Mary McGreskin, 39, of Drummore Road; and Guides Catherine
McKnight, 10, of Pitmilly Road; Margaret-Ann Riddick, 11, of Bankglen
Road; and Laura Cullen, 10, of Belsyde Avenue; all Drumchapel. Fifteen
other Guides were injured, six of them seriously.
A fatal accident inquiry into the collision is to be held later this
year.

A WOMAN who sits on industrial tribunal panels is to have her own race
discrimination case heard by an industrial tribunal in Edinburgh today.
Ms Neelam Bakshi, a Labour councillor representing the Glasgow
Summerston ward of Strathclyde Regional Council, is to fight a case of
alleged racial discrimination against Falkirk District Council along
with another Glasgow woman. It is believed their complaint relates to a
job application with the council.
Ms Bakshi is part of a pool of members who are called upon to sit on
industrial tribunal panels.
As a labour councillor, she failed to win selection for a ward under
the new council reforms. She will continue as councillor for Summerston
in Glasgow until March 31 next year.
Ms Bakshi, a champion of women's rights and ethnic issues, is also one
of 12 finalists in the Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year competition.
The winner is to be announced next month.
The hearing is due to take place at the industrial tribunal office in
Edinburgh today at 10am.

A NINETEENTH-CENTURY ironmaster has unwittingly donated a secret
golden legacy to Glasgow. And the two young architects who accidently
discovered his treasure trove now have a pearl beyond price. They are
living and working in a building which is, quite simply, one of the
city's architectural jewels.
Everyone who buys an old house has the same secret dream. They hope
that when they rip out the more recent interior decor they will unveil
an incredible mural or artifact from the past, hidden behind those
chipboard units...
Architects Lucy Parr and Graeme Shearer discovered that such a
revelation can cause the world to beat a path to your door - and up your
stairs, through your drawing room, and into your kitchen. On last year's
Open Doors day some 2400 people trooped through their home and workplace
within six hours.
Yet, when they bought the first floor flat in the conversion at No.3
Park Terrace, they were simply looking for a place which would give them
living space as well as a big room in which to base their small
architectural practice.
Designed by the architect Charles Wilson, Park Terrace was built in
1855 as part of his wonderful Park District scheme which dominates the
skyline above Kelvingrove Park.
When Lucy and Graeme were knocking down a partition shortly after
buying the house, a remarkable discovery was made. Under many layers of
wallpaper and paint lay the original decor of the drawing room -
astonishing gilded walls, painted in 24-carat gold.
Ornamental cherubs were found wrapped in newspapers. Exuberant
cornicing flowed across the ceiling and an impressive console table
dominated a previously unregarded part of the apartment. Everything that
glistered was painted, literally, in gold.
''We were astonished,'' says Graeme Shearer. ''As architects we felt a
strong sense of responsibility to at least try to restore the room to
its original grandeur.'' Yet they had bought the run-down house because
it was all they could afford and it had a good view across the city!
Historical research revealed that the building had been owned by Sir
James Bain of Crofthead (1817-1898), a Victorian ironmaster who became
Lord Provost of Glasgow in 1874.
The house was more than a home. He used it as a place in which to
entertain visiting dignitaries such as the Prince and Princesss of Wales
in 1876. General Ulysses Grant, former President of the USA, dined at
Number 3 when he was given the Freedom of Glasgow the following year.
When on his foreign travels, Sir James sent regular despatches back to
the Glasgow Herald of the day. His suggestions for the creation of an
Indian railway became the basis of one of the world's most famous
railway networks.
But financial research revealed that two youg architects could not
possibly afford to pay all of the costs of restoration.
They turned to public sector agencies like Historic Scotland, the
Glasgow Development Agency, and Glasgow District Council for help. ''We
were pleasantly surprised by how keen they were to assist us. They were
extremely helpful and we could not have resto red the drawing room
without them,'' says Graeme Shearer.
It took three long years and many thousands of pounds of public money
to restore the Victorian Drawing Room to its former glory. Expert
restorers were able to retrace the design of the original stencils,
which have now been copied in sumptuous golden hue s matching the
originals.
''We were able to do so much because so many of the features from 150
years ago were still here. The mirrors, the cornicing, the servants'
bells, the door escutcheons. It was all here,'' says Graeme Shearer.
As part of the deal, Lucy Parr and Graeme Shearer had to agree to open
the house to the public several times a year. During the last 12 months
no less than 47 groups and tours have visited their combined home and
architectural practice. ''Nobody gets turn ed away - but you have to
make an appointment!,'' says Lucy Parr. The 5,000 pamphlets published
last year to explain the background tothe discovery have al been snapped
up and a new print run ordered.
What visitors now see is a copy of the walls as they were commissioned
by Sir James Bain, but the original gold patterns are preserved
underneath, although much faded. ''If anyone in the future wants to
carry out a full restoration, then the original wor k is still there.
That's a very important principle,'' says Graeme Shearer.
But when they leave the Provost's drawing room, a further surprise
awaits the thousands of visitors who are expected to tramp up the stairs
at No.3 Park Terrace this year. With the support of the planning
department, the back of the house has been turned into a very modern
living and working space.
A large room with a very high ceiling serves three functions - kitchen
and living space below, while a workspace with drawing boards,
computers, filing cabinets, desks has been created on a new mezzanine
area above.
''We had worried that the planners would be rather precious about us
wanting to change the look of the back rooms, but they were incredibly
helpful. They realise that if people are to move back into this area,
then many of the buildings will h ave to go through some changes,'' says
Lucy Parr.
And that poses a dilemma which conservationists, planners, and
purchasers of important period buildings will have to ponder. Glasgow
claims, rightly, that the historic Park District is an architectural
asset of international importance. But those elegant townhouses will
only return to residential use if people can carry out alterations which
make them easier to live in.
And why not? Those buildings were designed to live and work in. The
people who bought into Charles Wilson's vision 150 years ago were the
new merchant classes - brokers, lawyers, investors, and the occasional
Lord Provost - who spent part of their week working from home. Deals
(sometimes douce, sometimes dastardly) were done in those dramatically
decorated drawing rooms.
We must conserve the vast public rooms as best we can, but we need not
be too twee about some of the other parts of the townhouses. The
Victorians ploughed cash into elaborately decorating just three spaces -
the hall, the drawing room, and the dining room. Visitors were to be
impressed at all costs.
Other parts of the house tended to be simpler. After all, they were
designed for living in.

GLASGOW'S Lord Provost has warned regional councillors they will face
a ''backlash'' from district councillors and the public if any attempt
is made to relegate the City Chambers to a ceremonial cum museum
function.
Commenting on the possible scenario of the new unitary city council
being run from regional headquarters at Strathclyde House, an angry Lord
Provost Thomas Dingwall declared: ''I think this is an attempt to break
the Glasgow tradition and ethos centred on the City Chambers.
''It seems the regional councillors see themselves as something bigger
than Glasgow.''
His outburst came after Strathclyde's depute Labour leader, Councillor
Gerald McGrath, said consideration might be given to moving all
officials out of the City Chambers so as to allow more room for elected
members' facilities when the new ''shadow'' City of Glasgow Council
assumes full powers next April.
Councillor McGrath's remark had the effect of fanning the weekend row
over the future of the City Chambers when it emerged that some of the
new members of the ''shadow'' authority had been given a tour of
Strathclyde House and had shown a preference for the facilities
available to councillors there.
On top of that, there were indications that the magnificent City
Chambers might be utilised as a city centre museum, with the members'
dining room being converted into a cafeteria for the public.
Yesterday, there was further speculation that the chief executive's
department of the new authority might be located at Strathclyde House
instead of the City Chambers.
Lord Provost Dingwall warned: ''What we have to be careful of is an
on-going exercise by the regional councillors who are members of the new
authority to move influence away from the City Chambers slice by slice.
''If either councillors or officials moved out, I think that would be
a down-grading of the City Chambers. I really don't see it happening and
I think there would be a terrible outcry if it did. The people of
Glasgow see the City Chambers as the hub, the centre of the city.''
Councillor McGrath emphasised that no decision had been taken,
although some of the new councillors had expressed a preference for
being being based at regional headquarters in India Street.
He explained: ''It may well be the case that, with the importance of
the new unitary authority and the need to establish civilised office
accommodation and services for councillors, the City Chambers might have
to lose the majority of its officials should it be decided the City
Chambers is to remain as the headquarters.''
However, he acknowledged there was ''major sentimental attachment'' to
the building, which he thought perfectly understandable.
Senior Glasgow councillor James Mutter, protested: ''The City Chambers
was built in 1888 and it will still be here in the year 2088, long after
Strathclyde House has been demolished.
''This is THE place. You get a feeling when you come in here that you
don't get anywhere else.''
Treasurer Gordon Macdiarmid, depute Labour leader of both Glasgow
district and the new ''shadow'' authority, claimed that current
Strathclyde councillors were trying to protect the structures and ethos
they were used to. In his view, the the agenda was Strathclyde Mark II,
in reduced form in Glasgow.
Against this backdrop he felt the visit by new members to Strathclyde
House had been ''hijacked'' by people who wanted to push the regional
facilities and ethos.

A leading estage agent condemns the GSPC's report that house prices
are falling as ''dismal and alarmist'' and produces his own figures
which show an altogether different picture
A LEADING west of Scotland estate agent has slammed lawyers as being
''dismal and alarmist'' about the state of the property market.
Scotland's Homes last week reported that the 146 member firms of the
Glasgow Solicitors Property Centre had revealed a 3% fall in average
house prices sold by them during the first quarter of this year.
John Hinshelwood, of estate agents Allen &amp; Harris, said: ''Though
everyone is agreed that the housing market is difficult, we and other
agents have shown solid gains this year.
''Allen &amp; Harris's business is at record levels, and I would be deeply
concerned if the public were needlessly frightened by these figures.
Good prices can still be achieved, however you need an effective
organisation.''
He dismissed the GSPC's Weekly List of properties as being similar to
The Big Issue, ''but with less visible street presence''.
His firm's 19 branches sold #27m of property in the first quarter of
this year, almost identical to the total achieved by GSPC's 146 members.
In contrast to the GSPC, Allen &amp; Harris's five Glasgow offices reported
an average price rise of 9% in the first quarter of 1995 against the
same period last year.
Referring to The Herald's calculation that GSPC members are selling,
on average, just over one house each per month, John Hinshelwood said:
''If this is so, there is a fundamental question to be asked - how can
solicitors hope to compete on service with full-time, professional
estate agents when most firms appear to be doing next to no business and
estate agency is barely a sideline?
''Solicitors maintain that they give independent, best advice to their
clients. On their own figures, best advice is clear - avoid them and use
a good agent.''
A spokesman for the GSPC said that it was ''academic'' to break down
the solicitors' figures into average sales per month, since some member
firms sold many more properties than the average.
''And the Weekly List is doing its job. It goes into solicitors
offices, banks and building societies. It has a huge reach, and we are
very pleased with its selling power.''

SCOTLAND'S leading councillors have recommended that the country's
council leaders should receive payments ranging from #17,000 to #24,000
for running the single-tier authorities.
Under the scheme, Councillor Keith Geddes, leader of the Labour
administration in Lothian Regional Council and who will be leader of the
administration in the new City of Edinburgh Council, would be paid
#23,000.
At present, he receives a basic allowance of #5750, a responsibility
payment of #4700, and about #1500 for subsistence, a total of #11,950.
Councillor Geddes said yesterday he was responsible for a budget of
#7m in Lothian and was a full-time councillor. Politicians in all
parties had welcomed the Scottish Secretary's decision to increase the
amount of money available for responsibility, he said.
On top of the basic allowances of between #5000 and #6000 for all
councillors, the leaders would receive special responsiblity payments.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities yesterday issued advice,
which it is asking the new councils to adopt.
Deputy leaders and chairmen of committees, it says, should be paid
allowances totalling from #14,000 in the smallest councils to #18,750 in
Edinburgh and #19,500 in Glasgow. Other councillors with
responsibilities, such as vice-chairmen, should be paid from #11,000 in
the smallest councils to #14,500 in Edinburgh and #15,000 in Glasgow.
Opposition leaders should be paid between 30% and 50% of the majority
leader's allowance. Decisions on the allowances to be paid to the
convener (or lord provost) and depute convener of the councils should be
delayed until the advice on the special responsibility allowances is
available.
Councillor Rosemary McKenna, Cosla president, said yesterday that it
was the first time there had been an opportunity to pay councillors, who
carried out a difficult job, at an appropriate level.

THE transfer of up to 50 engineering jobs from England to Scotland
under the merger of Nuclear Electric with Scottish Nuclear is unlikely
to go smoothly.
Last night, the English reaction to any jobs being sent north was
equivalent to that when Scots are forced south: expect a fight.
Tory MP Mr Douglas French was especially scathing that his Gloucester
constituency will lose most of the engineering jobs -- and perhaps 50
more in financial services.
He also dismissed the creation of a holding company based in East
Kilbride as a sop to Scotland.
Mr French, whose constituency contains Nuclear Electric's
headquarters, said he was ''dismayed'' by Mr Hesltine's announcement on
jobs. He will be pressing him for more precise information on what is
involved.
It would appear the plan involves bringing the engineering support
work for the English power stations Hinkley B and Heysham 2 -- and their
Scottish ''twins'' Hunterson B and Torness -- under one roof at East
Kilbride.
Mr French, who also suspects 50 financial jobs at Nuclear Electric's
headquarters will move north, said: ''It would appear Scotland is
gaining 100 jobs at our expense in Barnwood.''
He described the proposed new holding company in Scotland as ''simply
an umbrella'' because Nuclear Electric in Barnwood would continue to
operate as an independent company, and added: ''It appears to be a sop
to the Scots.''
The MP said it would have been far better to have retained the
headquarters in Gloucester and pointed out that Scots had not given the
privatisation any better reception after learning that the holding
company would be based in Scotland.
In Lancashire, county council leader Louise Ellman stressed that any
transfer of jobs from Heysham would be opposed. She said: ''We will
fight. We are determined to retain the maximum number of skilled jobs in
our area.''
Heysham, a village close to Morecambe, came under overall Labour
control for the first time in its history at the recent local elections.
Councillor Ellman warned that Tory MPs would be wiped out in
Lancashire if the Government pursued privatisation of the nuclear
industry.
She said Labour-controlled Lancashire County Council would call a
meeting of all interested parties if jobs were transferred from Heysham
to East Kilbride.

THE music of the leading Scottish composer, James MacMillan, featured
in two major awards presented in London last night by the Royal
Philharmonic Society.
The awards went to Hunter Productions, a Glasgow-based independent
film production company, for seven short films featuring a work of
MacMillan's, and to the Philharmonia Orchestra for a series of
contemporary music concerts directed by MacMillan, the orchestra's
visiting composer.
The series of films, The Seven Last Words from the Cross, was
commissioned by the BBC's religious broadcasting unit and was broadcast
on BBC2 and Radio Three during Easter 1994. It won the Radio, Television
and Video category of the Royal Philharmonic Society awards.
The Philharmonia Orchestra won the award in the Large Ensemble
category for a number of projects, including a set of early evening
concerts devised and directed by James MacMillan, entitled Music of
Today, and devoted to championing new British music.
The judges of the society described the television series as ''an
original combination of contemporary devotional music and contemplative
visual images conceived especially for television.''
The Seven Last Words was performed by two Scottish musical
organisations, the choir Cappella Nova and the string orchestra, the BT
Scottish Ensemble. It was recorded in the disused St Francis RC Church
in the Gorbals.
The Royal Philharmonic Society award -- a trophy in the form of a lyre
-- was collected last night from the Duchess of Kent at a ceremony in
the Dorchester Hotel by James Hunter, director of Hunter Productions and
a former head of television at BBC Scotland.
Mr Hunter said that the news of the award had come ''out of the
blue''. It was, he said, ''a big surprise -- but it's always nice to
beat the London mob''.

WORK began yesterday on cleaning up hundreds of teddy bears damaged by
smoke when fire broke out in their Georgian-house home in
Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Around 400 teddy bears were rescued by a human chain formed by
firefighters and neighbours.
The bears, thought to be worth a total of #250,000, were ferried to
safety from the blaze at the home of Mr Peter Fagan and his wife
Frances, owners of a company, Colour Box Miniatures, inspired by the
collection.
When the outbreak happened in the house at The Avenue, firefighters
stationed themselves between an upstairs bedroom and the front door and
with the help of family members and neighbours passed the bears down the
line.
The rescuers were not able to save the entire collection of teddies
and toys owned by seven-year-old Lucy Fagan, which were destroyed along
with most of her other possessions.

A REPORT in The Herald last month was instrumental in saving the West
Highland sleeper.
The Herald's disclosure that ScotRail planned to run so-called ''ghost
trains'' as a new late-night service, in effect as a ruse to avoid
detailed consultation, gave Highland Regional Council the legal argument
it needed to persuade the Court of Session that ScotRail was trying to
circumvent statutory closure procedures required by the 1993 Railways
Act.
However, the fight to protect these services has been a tough and at
times acrimonious one, attracting support from Opposition parties and
even some Conservative MPs.
Matters reached a head when even the editors of Hansard were found to
have missed out key words uttered by the Scottish Office Minister Sir
Hector Monro when the Scottish Grand Committee was discussing the
Government's commitment to full, public consultation on rail services.
The timetable:
* August 31, 1994: British Rail chairman Sir Bob Reid admits that the
future of London-Scotland sleepers is under review because of the
effects of signal workers' strike.
* December 11, 1994: Mr Roger Salmon, BR's director of passenger rail
franchising, admits he cannot guarantee future of sleeper service for
budgetary reasons.
* December 14: Mr Salmon confirms he is excluding the Fort William and
West Country cross-border sleeper services from the minimum service
levels required of train operators under rail privatisation, but does
guarantee sleeper services between London and Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Aberdeen, and Inverness.
* January 1, 1995: British Rail confirms that Edinburgh-based Motorail
services will cease from end of May; service operates ''piggy-back'' on
sleeper services.
* January 11, 1995: ScotRail director Chris Green warns that
Government demands for budget cuts are threatening the quality of
ScotRail services.
* January 27: Mr Green claims there is little chance of retaining Fort
William sleeper service because it is one of the most heavily subsidised
trains in Britain and would need more than #3m subsidy a year.
* February 2: Liberal Democrat MPs call on the rail regulator to step
in and save the sleeper and Motorail services and claim their future was
decided without consultation; Rail Users' Consultative Committee says it
was not consulted.
* February 6: Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney claims public
subsidy on West Highland sleeper is #540 per passenger, including #360
in infrastructure costs.
* February 8: Sir Hector Monro gives commitment to Scottish Grand
Committee of full and formal consultation -- or does he? Confusion
reigns.
* February 9: Scottish Office gives its interpretation -- that after
publication of proposed passenger service requirement in May there will
be a formal process of consultation with the RUCC and local authorities.
* February 10: The Herald reveals that Hansard missed out key words
uttered by Sir Hector Monro while discussing consultation before
Scottish Grand Committee.
* March 16: Mr Green resigns in protest at attempts by BR to ''gag''
him after he has criticised cuts to ScotRail services.
* March 14: Formal announcement of withdrawal of West Highland sleeper
and Motorail services.
* March 15: Convention of Scottish Local Authorities prepares to take
Government to court over withdrawal of services. It emerges that
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang was not notified of announcement, despite
BR's claims it had consulted Scottish Office.
* March 22: ScotRail director John Ellis warns that if legal action to
prevent withdrawal of services without full public consultation is
successful, and he is forced to run services without additional
financial support, ''it would mean serious difficulties for other
Scottish services''.
* April 1: The Herald discloses ScotRail plans to run so-called
''ghost trains'' late at night and list them as passenger services to
avoid legal action that could save the West Highland sleeper. The new
service, run after 11pm between Maryhill and Bishopbriggs, would save
ScotRail from potential embarrassment in court by ensuring that a short
link known as the Cowlairs chord remained in use legally. The sleeper
from Fort William to London is the only passenger service currently
using the Cowlairs chord, and under the terms of the Railways Act 1993,
removing passenger services from a line amounts to closure, which by law
must be subjected to detailed, lengthy, and far tougher consultation.
Legal opinion had suggested that the West Highland sleeper could be
saved by judicial review.
* April 11: Highland Regional Council seeks legal opinion following
The Herald's ''ghost train'' report.
* April 25: Highland Regional Council launches its legal challenge in
the Court of Session, alleging that closure decision is illegal,
irrational, and unreasonable, and accusing BR of perpetrating a ''sham''
by planning to run late-night, one-way ''ghost trains'' on short
stretches of line near Glasgow.
* May 1: The Herald discloses report by Edinburgh-based rail
consultants Pieda which contradicts Government claims that each West
Highland sleeper passenger is subsidised by #453, stating instead that
in reality it is #70, a figure similar to subsidies paid to many rural
lines in England and Wales.
* May 5: The Herald discloses that ScotRail has had to put on an extra
carriage on the threatened Fort William service to cope with increased
demand.
* May 9: Lord Kirkwood in the Court of Session upholds Highland
Regional Council's legal challenge and grants an interim interdict on
closure. He holds that the withdrawal of the sleeper would amount to a
proposal to discontinue all the railway passenger services on three
sections of line in Strathclyde under the terms of the Railways Act
1993.

WORLD leaders ended VE Day celebrations yesterday with ringing calls
for reconciliation.
However, Moscow -- hosting the final day of commemorations -- followed
a parade of veterans across Red Square by rolling out an awesome display
of military might.
Mr John Major and President Bill Clinton stayed away from the military
show because of fresh battles in Chechnya.
But -- out of respect for Russia's decisive Second World War role and
its 26.6 million war dead -- they avoided any direct criticism of
Moscow.
* The people of St Petersburg marked VE Day yesterday by mourning more
than a million of their relatives and friends who died in the Nazi siege
of Russia's second city, formerly called Leningrad.
There were emotional ceremonies in cemeteries where the remains of
siege victims lie in mass graves.

DAWN Homes has earned a formidable reputation in Scotland, thanks to
its vision in choosing attractive sites and its individual approach to
quality and style. For the company believes in creating bright new house
styles with the emphasis on open space.
And nowhere is the success of the company's strategy more obvious than
at Monkton Court, a prestigious flatted development in the heart of
Prestwick, the company's home territory. With Ayr just five minutes by
car, Glasgow under an hour away, and two railway stations close by, the
development makes the ideal commuter retreat.
The beach, sea, and bustling shops of Prestwick town centre are only a
short walk, while golfers can enjoy the ultimate luxury of a course --
and not just any old course -- on their doorstep. It was at Prestwick
Old in 1860 that competitive golf began with the first Open
Championship.
Dawn Homes was set up in 1991, following the restructuring of Dawn
Construction, the major building company which has been in business for
more than 22 years. Managing director Andrew Reid said: ''We consider
the quality of the location to be the first essential in choosing a
site, and we think we know what our clients are looking for.''
His confidence is borne out by the success of the first phase of
Monkton Court, where the 39 flats were quickly snapped up. Not content
to sit on its laurels, Dawn Homes has consulted the residents of phase
one and further improved the specification of the second phase.
The standard specification includes full gas central heating, double
glazing, fully fitted continental-style kitchen, door entry telephone
system (Dawn Homes places much emphasis on security), and car parking.
In the two-bedroom and three-bedroom styles, an en-suite shower room
supplements the family bathroom.
The kitchens -- which come supplied with quality units including
integrated dishwasher, fridge/freezer, oven hob, hood, and washer/drier
-- have been extended to make space for dining; vanity units have been
fitted in the bathrooms for which there is an extensive choice of
quality tiles; and mirrored wardrobes have been replaced with a wider
choice of fitted bedroom furniture.
The sense of space has been enhanced by re-designing and cutting out
the corner of the L-shaped hallway.
''We build larger flats than many other builders,'' explained Andrew
Reid. ''We get the architects to design around what people want rather
than what we think they should have. We have found that people want
larger rooms, and more cupboard space.''
So, unlike most modern flats, which tend to regard storage space as an
afterthought, there are plenty of well-thought out cupboards at Monkton
Court.
The quality feel is enhanced by the high standard of finish -- with
the woodwork, for example, this results from using Dawn Group joiners as
opposed to sub-contractors.
Externally, Monkton Court takes its design cue from the established
Victorian housing on neighbouring Monkton Road, with generous bay
windows and attractive roof finals.
The foyer, stairs, and hallways are wallpapered and carpeted
throughout, with wall lighting. Each landing features a reflective
glazed screen which mirrors the large glass areas which are a striking
design feature at the rear of the building.
There are 24 luxury flats available at Monkton Court: three
three-bedroomed ''Vardon'' apartments, six one-bedroomed ''Park''
apartments, and 15 two-bedroomed ''Lyle'' or ''Braid'' apartments, with
prices ranging from #52,000 to #84,000. All the apartments have large
lounge with feature bay and glorious views over Prestwick Academy
playing fields to the rear and a garden centre and playing fields to the
front -- and over the professionally landscaped grounds which emphasise
the feeling of space within the development.
''Anyone who sees the landscaping and how the project has been
finished knows immediately that they are looking at an up-market
development,'' said Andrew Reid.
So in all respects, Dawn Homes guarantees a commitment to quality,
size, and to serving the individual needs of its clients.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Nuclear to retain identity</HEADLINE>

HARD bargaining by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has secured Scottish
Nuclear an independent identity within a new national company which will
be sold to private buyers next year for an estimated #3000m.
There will also be widespread cuts in bills. One of 8% in England and
Wales with the early ending of a nuclear levy, and a promise in the
Commons of similar ''significant'' reductions in Scotland by the
President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine. He added that
electricity prices in Scotland were already some 10% below English
prices.
However, the Government's White Paper on Prospects for Nuclear Power
which accompanied the merger deal appeared to cast doubt on future
expansion by a privatised nuclear industry. It said private finance for
new nuclear power stations ''is unlikely to be forthcoming in current
conditions without a transfer of risks away from private investors to
another party''.
Hailing the privatisation plan as ''a really good deal for Scotland,''
Mr Lang said: ''Far from leading to the decline and disappearance of an
important industry in Scotland, it secures for it a bright long-term
future.
''It brings a major new company headquarters to Scotland and it
increases Scottish employment. Scottish Nuclear's existence as a
separate entity will be wholly preserved and guaranteed in the long
term.''
SN management welcomed the plans as the best compromise attainable by
the Scottish Secretary after earlier fears the East Kilbride company
would be swallowed up in a merger with the larger Cheltenham-based
Nuclear Electric.
However, Labour condemned it as an ''ill-conceived attempt to fund tax
cuts prior to the next General Election''. Scottish Nuclear workers
warned of job losses and promised to continue their fight against the
privatisation.
Mr Heseltine, meanwhile, promised that the early removal of Fossil
Fuel Levy in the south would lead to an 8% cut in electricity prices,
and under the new company Scottish consumers would also benefit from
similar reductions.
His announcement of detailed plans for the merger of Scottish Nuclear
and Nuclear Electric included:
* The creation of a holding company, based in Scotland, with the two
nuclear generators as subsidiaries, to preserve the identity of both
companies and create more than 100 new jobs.
* Special shares will be held in the holding company and separately in
Scottish Nuclear -- by the Scottish Secretary -- and Nuclear Electric
for a minimum of 10 years to protect both companies status.
* Scottish Nuclear to continue to meet about half of Scottish
electricity needs until at least 2005, while the company will maintain
its own board of directors and identity.
* The decommissioning of the old Magnox reactors held by both
companies would be undertaken within the public sector, with activities
eventually transferred to British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
Mr Heseltine said the scheme offered the scope for competition while
promising that safety remained paramount.
SN board's preferred option had been a privately owned Scottish
company based in East Kilbride running the AGR plants at Torness and
Hunterston.
Last night SN chairman Mr James Hann thanked the media and the
workforce for forcing the Government to think again and adopt new merger
plans. He also praised Mr Lang for cutting the best deal possible for SN
against an uncompromising option by Nuclear Electric and Mr Heseltine.
Mr Hann said: ''We are disappointed that our arguments for remaining
an independent company did not prevail, but we recognise that the
Government have responded to our concerns for the jobs of our people at
Scottish Nuclear and in Scotland in forming their decision and this is
so much better than we originally thought may happen.''
Labour's Shadow Industry Secretary, Dr John Cunningham, said the
planned sell-off reeked of an ill-conceived scheme to fund pre-General
Election tax cuts.
The Scottish Nuclear Workers Campaign, which represents the interests
of workers at Hunterston, Torness and East Kilbride, said it would fight
the plans along with workers from Nuclear Electric. It did not trust
Government promises of 100 new jobs and warned many of these could be
duplicating work already carried out by Scottish Nuclear and would
inevitably lead to job cuts in other areas.
An SNP spokesman said it would campaign with the workers to oppose
''this nuclear merger madness which will jeopardise jobs and safety.''
The Government has pressed ahead with its privatisation plans in the
teeth of widespread misgivings among Tory party members, some of whom
called the move ''political suicide''.
In the Commons, Mr Heseltine came under heavy fire from Opposition
MPs, though the Tories, including Scots, were broadly supportive.
Pledges that Scotland would benefit from arrangements ''comparable'' to
the 8% cut in bills were greeted on the opposition benches with the same
scepticism as Mr Heseltine's claim that an extra 100 jobs are destined
for Scotland as a result of the reorganisation.
In the Perth and Kinross by-election campaign Labour used a leaked
copy of an internal Tory straw poll to launch an onslaught on the
sell-off plans. Candidate Mr Douglas Alexander said the six-page report
drawn up by the Conservative Political Centre had canvassed the views of
945 Tories across 144 parts of the UK, including four in Scotland, and
revealed that 41% of the party's own activists were opposed to
privatisation.

A FINANCIAL package hammered out last night is likely to secure the
future of the cash-strapped Edinburgh Festival Theatre. The theatre,
which has a deficit of #3.1m, had only a few weeks to clear its debts or
face bankruptcy.
However, at a three-hour meeting last night, Edinburgh District
Council's ruling Labour group agreed to a complex financial package to
ease the cash crisis.
Council leader Lesley Hinds said that, if the rescue package received
support from other public bodies, the future of the theatre would be
secure.
Under the scheme, the district council would contribute #1m and give a
guarantee to the bank about the theatre's overdraft.
However, the #1m cash contribution would be released only if either
Lothian Regional Council or Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Limited
matched the donation. The council would also consider, if need be, a #1m
interest-free loan.
The spotlight will now be put on Lothian Regional Council and the
local enterprise trust to contribute to the funding package.
The theatre, formerly the Empire and latterly used as a bingo hall,
re-opened only eight months ago with financial aid from the district
council.
Regional council leader Eric Milligan was not available last night for
comment on the district council decision. Earlier, he said: ''If the
district approve the package, clearly they will be requesting the
regional council to look at it with some sympathy.''
The district's ruling Labour group also agreed last night to find
extra cash to allow the capital's theatres Lyceum and The Traverse the
same budget as last year. Theatre bosses were worried it might be cut by
as much as 7%.

JOB movers are among the main people to benefit from part-exchange,
according to Iain Stewart, director of Tay Homes.
He said: ''Job movers who do not have the time or inclination to be
involved in the sale of their present home while starting a new job some
distance away, are one of the main groups who benefit from our
part-exchange scheme. Another group are potential purchasers who find it
provides confidence for that move.''
The basics of the Tay scheme begin with the criteria that the
purchaser must be trading up by at least #20,000 in value, that a
reservation must be placed on the new property and that it must be
complete or within three to four months of completion.
''The purchaser's present property is valued by both a building
society valuer and an estate agent,'' said Iain Stewart. ''Based on the
resulting average valuation, an offer is made to the purchaser --
usually at valuation less costs which average around #2000.''
If the customer accepts, missives are concluded. If not, then either a
revised offer is negotiated or the customer can cancel.
Tay Homes also operate an alternative to full part-exchange, their
''Backstop'' plan.
The same principles apply but the new property is one which will not
be completed for around six months or more.
''The purchase is given a valuation, usually #1000 to #2000 below a
full part-exchange offer. They have until four weeks before the new
house is ready to indicate whether they wish to accept our offer or have
sold themselves.
''The benefits include a guaranteed sale, a negotiation tool against
other potential purchasers of the old home, and that all-important
confidence.''

TWENTY per cent of Wimpey Homes' business in Scotland last year was
linked to their Keychange part-exchange scheme.
Wimpey has offered this scheme to customers for the last 12 years. It
was primarily introduced to combat the difficult market conditions of
the time, but today Wimpey see it as here to stay.
Under the scheme the customer is able to purchase a Wimpey home
without incurring the expense of bridging loans, estate agents' fees,
advertising costs and the worry of selling existing property. Wimpey
describe it as providing a situation which brings the enjoyment back to
moving house.
The scheme has proved so popular that Wimpey Homes (Scotland West) has
recently opened an office in Renfrew to cope specifically with the
demand. The office operates from 1b Paisley Road, Renfrew and marks the
first time that Wimpey has invested in a high street shop front. Four
Wimpey Homes' employees are on hand to deal with Keychange inquiries.
Ian Brown, regional sales and marketing director at Wimpey Homes
(Scotland West) said: ''The Keychange part-exchange scheme is now very
much regarded by Wimpey as an ongoing part of the housing business.
Instead of it being a separate area, Wimpey regards the scheme as an
integral part of the house building business. We have responded to the
demand and provide a one-stop shop where potential customers can discuss
the possibilities of entering into an agreement. It is certainly an area
which the company takes very seriously and responds to the demand
accordingly.''
The criteria under which the scheme operates varies and the offer made
depends upon the property involved. Wimpey Homes will consider buying a
customer's property provided that its value is not more than 70% of the
price of the new Wimpey home. As an example, if the asking price of the
new home was #100,000 then Wimpey would expect the value of the
customer's existing home to be around #70,000 or less.
But each case is examined on an individual basis. This includes taking
into account the type of home, the area in which it is situated, and its
condition.
As a national company, Wimpey can also take properties across Britain
into consideration when customers are looking to relocate in Scotland.

THE Prime Minister today faces a two-pronged problem -- the state of
the pound sterling and the state of his party at Westminster. Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke is expected to tell the Tory conference in Glasgow that
he will cut taxes but sterling was plunging on the markets yesterday.
It closed 1.07 cents lower against the dollar and 1.36 pfennigs down
on the German mark.
Tonight in the Commons, Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley is
challenged by a Labour motion to defend her NHS policy, against Tory
back-bench criticism. Mrs Bottomley may survive the vote -- but the
Chancellor's performance in Glasgow today is more critical to Government
economic strategy, which held down interest rates last week.
The Chancellor is expected to tell the party conference that he is on
track to reduce direct taxes in the autumn, despite the pressure on the
pound from the markets yesterday because he refused to increase interest
rates last Friday. At Westminster, the Tory party was divided on the
wisdom of this decision, despite the fact the Governor of the Bank of
England, Mr Eddie George, went along with it.
Tonight, Mrs Bottomley faces a Government-delayed challenge to her in
the Commons on a Labour Party motion highly critical of her handling of
the NHS reforms, which involve the closure or gearing down of historic
London hospitals like St Bartholomew's. Her reforms are opposed by
former Cabinet Minister Peter Brooke, London MP John Gorst, and former
Government Minister Sir Rhodes Boyson.
The Government's majority in the Commons is reduced to 10 and
tonight's vote will be a close-run thing, much depending on support or
otherwise by the Ulster Unionists.
But this does not handle the ongoing political dilemma for the Prime
Minister, who returned from Moscow last night, with full pressure on him
to resolve the Tory debacle of last week's local government elections,
leaving them with only 13 councils throughout mainland Britain.
The Chancellor's speech today in Glasgow and the Prime Minister's
handling of his back benchers tonight might decide whether there is a
serious run on sterling. The situation is so serious that it may be
necessary for the Prime Minister to address the weekly meeting of his
back benchers next Thursday.
By next Thursday, Mr Major, who has been in Paris, Berlin, and Moscow
for VE Day celebrations, will be able to take soundings on whether a
July reshuffle of his ministerial team would suffice to improve the
Tories' desperate political situation.
Today, Tory back benchers will be meeting in various groups to decide
whether various Cabinet Ministers, like the Chancellor, should be
removed as part of a damage-limitation exercise to promote Government
competence.
On Friday, Mr Major comes to Glasgow to try to relaunch his Government
in the wake of the local election results.

ONE of the UK's largest private housebuilders -- seventh in the league
at current listings -- Persimmon Homes have, like their competition, a
strong interest in making home buying as straightforward as possible.
But by last autumn the firm realised that while there was no shortage
of people genuinely interested in buying their properties they included
a number who were reluctant to commit themselves until they had sold
their existing homes.
''As a company, we were offering buyers what we regarded as an
unbeatable package including our Home Change Scheme,'' said Margaret
Cumming, sales director for Persimmon. ''This involved us in the
professional marketing of the client's property at no cost to the
client.
''However there was no guarantee that the property would sell at the
end of an agreed period. So we decided to offer straight part-exchange
-- Persimmon would buy the client's home at an agreed valuation and the
client could have a brand new Persimmon Home.''
As a result, while removing the client's uncertainty of selling and
leaving them clear to move into their new home, Persimmon acquired a
number of properties, known as established homes, throughout central
Scotland. These ranged from one-bedroom flats to four-bedroom detached
villas.
''Then, instead of piecemeal advertising, we took the decision to
advertise stock of established properties as a planned marketing
campaign, using highly visible advertising on a regular basis.''
That was an outstanding success and the inquiry level about the scheme
has remained high ever since.
Another advantage Persimmon can offer when it comes to marketing
established homes is that the prospective purchaser can also receive
financial assistance through low interest mortgage packages, with legal
costs and survey fees also being partially funded.
While the second-hand market remains uncertain, Persimmon see
part-exchange as the ideal solution to all concerned and ''another
string to our negotiating bow.''

AN ideal illustration of the overall importance of part-exchange
procedures to today's Scottish housebuilding scene, comes from the
Barratt company.
''Our Oakleaf part-exchange team has proved itself,'' said a Barratt
spokesman. ''Last year, the department had a #10m turnover of
established homes.''
As a benchmark, that represents a lot of houses by any standard. They
came in all sizes and values, they were in a wide scatter of locations.
The Oakleaf team which buys in established homes from buyers who are
moving into new Barratt homes then sells them ''at prices well below
current market values'' bought and sold homes ranging from #21,000 flats
to top-of-the-range family properties costing up to #147,000.
Christine Hill, director of sales for Barratt West Scotland, says,
''We first introduced the concept of part-exchange back in 1971 and
since then the scheme has gone from strength to strength as more people
opt for a speedy, frustration-free move.''
Barratt uses independent specialist valuers to inspect the properties
free of charge then returns a part-exchange decision within seven days.
The builder says that as a result a customer moving into a new Barratt
home can find the result is a speedy, hassle-free move saving hundreds
of pounds on advertising, estate agency, and valuation selling costs.
Now there is also an innovative mortgage subsidy scheme. On some
selected properties the buyer's mortgage is reduced to #25 a week for a
year on loans up to #50,000. This it is claimed can result in saving
buyers over #1700 in payments over 12 months.
Under its separate Home Exchange service, Barratt offer a service to
buyers with an existing property to sell and a package of incentives for
first time buyers.
Under the Home Exchange package, Barratt can either consider buying a
customer's present home subject to its normal part-exchange conditions
or can offer to sell it for the customer through its Agency Selling
Service.
''Our Home Exchange scheme is the ideal solution for buyers who have
outgrown their homes and who want to move quickly and smoothly up to a
larger home,'' said Christine Hill. ''We have always believed in making
homebuying easier, and that applies to Oakleaf as well as to our new
homes.''

Bill Knox reports on the schemes
available from Scotland's builders
BUILDERS do not view part-exchange as a major revenue source. They are
in the business of building and selling new homes, and part-exchange is
a means of providing extended customer service.
''It is a service which unlocks the chain on house sales,'' said
Deborah Benson, sales and marketing director (UK) of Miller Homes at
their Edinburgh headquarters. ''It can be a valuable service to our
customers. They can save money, time and avoid a lot of potential stress
by opting for part-exchange.''
The benefits can be considerable. Financially, vendors make
significant savings on the cost of marketing their property,
particularly the saving in advertising and agency fees.
''Moving house is usually a balancing act,'' said Deborah Benson.
''The seller is trying to achieve a right price for the current home,
offering the right price to secure the new home, and hoping to
co-ordinate moving out of the first at the right time to move into the
second. It can be a very traumatic experience, especially for the
inexperienced.''
With part-exchange towards a new home, customers can rest assured,
knowing what price they have achieved on their property and having a
contractually agreed price on the new home. With a guaranteed
back-to-back sale, they cannot end up temporarily homeless and needing
rented accommodation.
''Part-exchange is also a real benefit to customers who can't face the
idea of having hordes of viewers trooping through their home. At Miller
Homes, we have used part-exchange to help soon-to-be-mothers who
appreciate peace and quiet, older customers who do not feel secure
allowing open viewing, and those who just hate to feel they are losing
their privacy by having to show strangers through their home.''
Customers may sometimes be disappointed if they are not offered as
much for their property as they had hoped.
''But at Miller Homes we have two external valuations performed on any
potential part-exchange property and so offers are based on the true
market value of a home. Buying in a part-exchange property represents a
commercial risk for a builder, and all builders will look very carefully
at the costs involved. So inquirers should not be surprised not to
receive an instant offer on their property.
''Builders are taking the risk on behalf of their customers.''
Miller Homes have 16 house construction sites, mainly in the central
belt between Ayr and Aberlady and a further series of ''partnership''
sites.
Currently they are offering a 3.99% fixed mortgage rate for one year
arranged through a prominent Scottish building society. Also available
is a free mortgage protection assurance which operates over a period of
up to three years offering payments of up to a maximum of 12 months.
Both offers are subject to status.

THE Fort William to London Euston sleeper service, due to be axed
later this month, won a court reprieve yesterday, and provoked a warning
from ScotRail.
It said more painful cuts affecting thousands of extra passengers
could now be necessary. There was also a renewed fear of job cuts.
ScotRail's finance director Alex Lynch, who was in the Court of
Session for the ruling, said it had a statutory duty to balance its
books: the #2.5m being lost by the sleeper would have to be saved
elsewhere.
He said he was disappointed with the outcome. Lord Kirkwood has still
to produce full written reasons for his decision.
''It does not remove the substantial financial implications,'' Mr
Lynch said. He added: ''If there is no change in the financial provision
to the board overall there will either have to be a relaxation of the
budget for Scotland or we will have to meet our financial obligations by
finding economies elsewhere.
''We would need to look at a number of other services, probably rural
routes and commuter services in the east. It certainly means that rather
than 50 customers a day being affected by the sleeper closure it could
be 5000 or 10,000.''
Last night, the spectre of 600 ScotRail job losses and fewer trains
rose as officials studied the accounts. Senior sources suggested that
contingency plans drawn up in secret late last year by management to
counter losses during the signal workers' strike would have to be dusted
down.
These include the axing or reduction of services on the West Highland
line, the Stranraer-Glasgow route, and services from Inverness to Kyle,
Wick, and Thurso.
Mr Chris Green, then ScotRail director, warned of 600 job losses,
fewer trains, and higher fares unless Government funding was increased.
Since April 1, ScotRail has faced budget cuts of 5% -- and now has to
find #2.5m for the Fort William sleeper.
One senior ScotRail official said last night: ''Mr Green knew how
difficult the financial restraints were and warned of savage cuts. Now a
court says we have to run a service which has #2.5m losses. It is clear
something will have to go to balance the books unless additional funding
is made available.''
Lord Kirkwood upheld the challenge to the closure plans by Highland
Regional Council and granted an interim interdict effectively saving the
service pending detailed public consultation.
British Rail had announced its intention to close the West Highland
sleeper service, which has run since July 1901, from May 28. Under the
1993 Railways Act any plan to discontinue all railway passenger services
on a line must be preceded by three months' notice to the Director of
Passenger Rail Franchising.
This is supposed to set in motion safeguards to ensure that passengers
and other interested bodies such as local authorities can make their
views known.
As revealed by The Herald, British Rail planned to get round the
consultation process by running ''ghost'' services on three short
stretches of line in Strathclyde currently used only by the sleeper.
BR conceded that these late-night, one-way trains would be of little
or no use to the travelling public, but maintained that passenger
services were still being provided. However, this argument was rejected
by Lork Kirwood in his Court of Session ruling.
He decided the withdrawal of the sleeper amounted to a proposal to
discontinue all the railway passenger services on the three sections of
line in Strathclyde in terms of the 1993 Act.
He pronounced a decree setting aside the decision to close the service
from Fort William to London Euston and also granted an order banning the
closure of the service until consultation procedures have been
instituted and a final decision taken. Mr Christopher Haddow, QC, for
BR, pointed out to the judge that this could mean the court order
extending for years.
Mr Oliver Barratt, vice-chairman of the Scottish Association for
Public Transport, commented: ''It is a very great relief that the
Government can't get round the statutory closure procedure in a sneaky
way by running ghost trains in the middle of the night.''
There is a possibility that the court battle could become an academic
issue within the next two weeks when the franchising director will be
publishing services throughout Scotland which ScotRail is obliged to
operate. If the franchising director decides the West Highland sleeper
falls into that category, he will have to provide the finance.
Last night, the British Railways Board served notice of an appeal
which it hopes will be heard in a fortnight's time, three days before
the last sleeper was due to leave Fort William.
However, there is a wide cross section of Scottish opinion demanding
the board should accept the ruling.
The convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson, said:
''We are delighted with this ruling which exposes the sham of BR running
ghost trains as a device to withdraw the sleeper and Motorail service.''
Mr McPherson paid tribute to The Herald for revealing that the ''ghost
train'' device would be employed.
Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber MP Sir Russell Johnston was equally
adamant: ''British Rail must not appeal. They have always been
supportive of the Fort William sleeper and its future has only come into
question following the proposals for which they have no
responsibility.''
Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, said: ''God bless
the robust independence of the Scottish Courts.''
Shadow Transport Minister, Mr Henry McLeish, said: ''What is important
now is the question of whether rail policy is to be shaped in the courts
or by Ministers.''
He also called on BR to abandon any appeal.
The chairman of the Rail Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland,
Mr Lawrence Kemp, called on director of franchising Roger Salmon and his
office to act. He said: ''It is now up to OPRAF, who hold the purse
strings, to release the funding necessary to keep the sleepers
running.''
0 Mr Neil Clark, chairman of Lochaber District Council, said: ''I have
always been convinced that with proper marketing there could be a lot
more business for this service.
''I am disappointed that ScotRail's first reaction is to start talking
about making cuts elsewhere rather than preparing their case for support
to run the service.''
In the Commons the Government was accused of deceit over the closure
of the sleeper, and was called on to ensure sufficient funding was
available to keep the service running.
Referring to the ''ghost train'' invented by ScotRail to avoid closure
procedures, Labour MP Brian Wilson said: ''What does it tell us about
this Government that the Secretary of State for Scotland and the
Secretary of State for Transport were both prepared to conspire in a
deceit that has now been found to be illegal as well as immoral?''
SNP MP Margaret Ewing said the judgment offered a breathing space for
the public campaign against the loss of the sleeper.
