A proposal that people who move to a new property should be granted
MIRAS relief at the highest marginal rate of tax on the first #30,000
borrowed. This would induce people to buy for the first time, or to
move, thus stimulating the market.
In a bid to influence the Chancellor before next November's Budget,
the Chartered Association of Certified Accounts (ACCA) warns that
withdrawing mortgage interest benefits to the unemployed will prolong
the depressed state of the housing market.
Stagnation in the housing market is acting as a brake on what would
otherwise be a robust economic recovery, according to a leading Scottish
accountant.
Gilbert Little of the ACCA in Scotland, says: ''Our representation to
the Chancellor take account of the patchy nature of economic recovery.
The recession has not ended for many individuals or for non-export
related sectors of the economy.
We appreciate th e government's attempt to re-balance the economy away
from consumption-led GDP growth to one of export-led growth, but the
switch away from areas such as housing, personal taxation levels and
help for the unemployed, has been too dramatic.''
Calling on the government to re-think the decision to remove mortgage
interest benefit in the first nine months of unemployment, he warned
that the effect will be to prolong the stagnation in the housing market.
''The additional cost of private insurance (where individuals are able
to qualify for it) is likely to put many people in a position where they
will either not move or they will hesitate to enter the housing
market.''

Is this the West of Scotland's most exclusive new build development?
Fronting the famous Old Troon golf course at Crosbie Place in the
Ayrshire town, Wilson Homes (Kilmarnock) Ltd is building seven
exceptionally large villas around a courtyard.
''The words ''exclusive', ''unique' and ''executive' are often used
nowadays in the property field - usually inappropriately,'' says
Alistair Paterson of selling agents Douglas Inglis of Kilmarnock.
''But in this instance these adjectives would not be inappropriate.
Only the finest quality materials including natural sandstone,
hardwoods and leaded glass have been used.
It is extremely difficult to obtain planning consent for any such
development edging on to a Championship Golf Course, and the price range
-in excess of #300,000 - ensures exclusivity....
The National House Building Council has advised the developer that
they wish to give him an award for the scheme.

How can you be sure you are buying a well-built house? One way is to
choose a developer who is prepared to put his or her money where their
mouth is and actually live in their own houses. Builders who are
prepared to live on their own development must b e certain that they
have done a good job - otherwise relations with their new neighbours are
likely to be grim.
Stowcroft, a specialist Glasgow developer which is concentrating on
the top end of the market, can claim an unusual double. Both of its
directors (an architect and a surveyor) have opted live in homes
designed by the firm.
''My neighbours all bought houses from me, so I suppose I was
confident about the product,'' says architect Tom Cromar who lives in
Kirkhill Gate, the firm's first complex in Newton Mearns. ''Sure, I did
get the neighbours popping in now and again to say th at a tap was
dripping or a light not working, but frankly I didn't mind that too
much. If you get the quality right you won't have too many complaints -
the fact that we're prepared to live on our developments is a reflection
of our attitude to the house s we're building.''
Now his partner, Sandy Cooper, is poised to take entry of one of the
company's houses at their current development, Capelrig Lane, also in
Newton Mearns.
Stowcroft is a new residential development company which concentrates
on small exclusive developments in the West of Scotland's posher
suburbs. Tom Cromar says that the firm has two key selling points, the
quality of its houses and their sheer size.
The firm has designed a number of individual villas for clients in
Newton Mearns and Whitecraigs. ''Through these commissions we identified
a market for large one-off individually designed villas on attractive
sites,'' says architect Tom Cromar.
''I think we're building the biggest houses in the west of Scotland,
Whilst developers such as CALA, Dickie and others are undertaking
quality developments in the upper end of the market, no one is catering
for the demand for large one-off villas above 2, 500 sq ft which are set
in large plots - homes similar to those which made the Broom estate
famous in the 40's and 50's. We aim to cater for this select limited
market.''
Kirkhill Gate was completed in 1993. It is situated off a secluded
wooded farm road where five homes, each set in plots of about one third
of an acre, were constructed and sold within one week of advertising.
Tom Cromar says that suitable sites for this type of development are
hard to find. ''' However, Stowcroft has recently been successful in
securing a 3.50 acre site - once again in the heart of Newton Mearns.
''The site is off a secluded leafy lane, thus maximising privacy and
exclusivity. Similar to Kirkhill Gate, Stowcroft intends constructing
five individual villas, each with five bedrooms. They will be 2,700 sq
ft in size and stand on plot sizes of just un der half an acre.
''This site is surrounded by mature woodland and thus a delightfully
secluded and safe enclave will be created,.'' says Tom Cromar. While a
standard house type has been designed for the site and is under
construction, the developer is keen to achieve indiv iduality by
amending this standard house type - or designing a house to individuals
chosen requirements.
Houses of this size and individuality don't come cheap. Stowcroft's
prices start at #295,000. The firm can be contacted on 0141 226 4248.

THEY don't build them like this anymore, I used to say, proudly
leaning on the crumbling mullion that finally gave up the ghost in the
last heavy rain. The front window - once such a proud Victorian affair -
was beginning to look like one of those noseless, yeah even headless,
Egyptian lions that still sit guarding the Pyramids.
Nae chance, said the insurance company, that's wear and tear. Well
what about the piece of bedroom ceiling that fell on my wife's
newly-done hair and nearly broke her neck? (She was more concerned about
the hair than the neck, I have to say).
Wear and tear again, quoth they. ''Well, what do you expect,'' I
countered. ''The place is over a century old.''
Indeed, they said, that's the point. Even those fine Victorian
buildings with their high, elegant ceilings and bonnie twiddly bits that
so delight the middle classes eventually have to yield to the
inevitable. Just like Joanna Lumley, they can't stay young and beautiful
forever.
Well, they didn't actually mention Joanna Lumley; that's just a small
weakness of mine. We all have our weaknesses, after all, and I suppose
that has to apply to old houses as well.
The insurance thing has finally convinced me. But the case was
building up, like our tap-drippings in reverse.
Not only did most taps in the house drip constantly; there was this
deep, ominous, groaning rumble emanating constantly from a locked
cupboard that kept some ancient cistern or other. Visitors were
convinced it was the ghost of some early plumber.
You know the type. Honest sweat of the brow. Real craftsman.
Everybody's great grandfather, in the days when Britain was Great and no
doubt about it. When we knew how to do things, how to build things, and
how to patronise the world about that.
Now I don't want to put our great grandads down, but they were not as
perfect as all that. Neither were their materials. Some of the cobwebbed
things we found under floorboards and behind walls would make you gasp
at their Heath Robinson clumsiness.
Suffice to say that we've had enough of groaning pipes and things that
go crash in the night. We've gone for something new and it's made a new
man of me, not to mention a new woman of Her No Longer Upstairs.
Right first time. There are no creaking stairs. Only wide, expansive
areas of roomy light. High french windows that lead straight into the
garden. Cookers that light up effortlessly; fires that do the same. Taps
that don't drip; doors that fit and close with a satisfying click;
elegant wallpaper that wasn't pasted down with egg white during the
Crimean war.
Best of all, I swear I am lounging happily amid the lushly carpeted
evidence that they certainly don't build them like that anymore... and
thanking goodness for that.

MILNE CYGNET We all know that while the swan glides gracefully through
the water, its legs and feet are paddling like turbines underneath the
surface. It can be like that in the building trade. You open a
showhouse, show some people around - and then someone insists on buying
it. What will you show the next flock of potential buyers? Another
showhome will have to be produced so quickly that nobody notices the
ripples on the surface of your marketing effort. That's what happened at
Stewart Milne Homes' development at Cygnet Court in Duddingston,
Edinburgh.
The first showflat was released in April, sold in May, and occupied a
month later.
Now a second showhome has been opened and marks the release of the
final phase of flats at the development The interior the new showhome
has been designed to show how the flats can be decorated economically,
but effectively.
Situated in a residential area just a few minutes from Edinburgh's
Holyrood Park, the flats are within two blocks and surrounded by
landscaped grounds. Prices start at #59,995. Significantly interest has
already been shown in Cygnet Court and only seven flats now remain.
And a reservation has already been taken on the new showflat...

It could be sunny side up for buyers seeking low cost housing in
Coatbridge.
Beazer Homes has released the first of the new homes for sale at its
Sunnyside development in the Lanarkshire town.
Beazer, which has won several Greenleaf Awards for the visual
appearance of its developments, will be fully landscaping the site which
will have 57 one and two-bedroom flats. The first phase will be ready
for moving into by Christmas.
The development is within a short distance of the town centre and is
only yards away from the railway station. With prices starting at
#39,995, the development offers a range of choices for single people,
retired couples, and first time buyers.
Maureen Anderson, Beazer sales director, said: ''Judging from the
interest we have received to date, it appears that an increasing number
of people from the locality are looking to stay in the area when they
move home - which is really encouraging, as it creates a very positive
community feel even at this early stage. The same is true of our
Dunnotar Park development in the town where we have only four two
bedroom terraced houses still available.' Prices at Dunnotar Park range
from #45,795 to #47,495.
Meanwhile, the housebuilder has won the contract to supply the Pollok
community with high quality, low cost new homes.
With the assistance of a #665,000 Gro-Grant from Scottish Homes,
Beazer is building a mix of one bedroom flats and semi-detached houses
at Pollok's Dormanside Road.
As part of the regeneration project Beazer has pledged an additional
#17,500 to restore a swing park adjacent to the development, due for
completion next year.
Beazer's commercial director Callum Murray said; ''Our objective is to
provide low cost, affordable housing to an area where this would not
normally be possible. We are already seeing a mix of potential
purchasers interested in the development. Of the 47 homes planned, 20
have been sold to first-time buyers and those in the surrounding areas
wishing to trade across or up the market. And that is even before the
October opening of our showhome!' All homes come with a fitted kitchen.
Many of them incorporate ''barrier-free' components such as graded
access and wider doorways to assist in disability access.
Meanwhile, Beazer's development at Whins of Milton has sold some 29
out of a total of 48 homes in less than six months. The range includes
three bedroom semis and three and four bedrooom detached houses from
#63,995 to #92,995.

Is this Scotland's most dramatic showhouse view? From the living room
armchair at Manor Kingdom's development in North Queensferry you can
watch inter-city expresses and local commuter trains rumble across the
famous bridge that is still one of the engineering wonders or the world.
There is just one catch - developer Keith Punler is determined not to
sell the showhouse until he has purchasers for the other houses at his
cliffside development. Despite having already had keen inquiries, he is
shunting all offers into a siding for the next 18 months. ''It's
tempting to sell the showhouse, but we want to resist the idea until
we've sold the other houses. We've put a lot of effort into the
showhouse and it excites everyone who comes to see it,'' says Keith
Punler.
But buyers who want a stunning view need not be disappointed, a stroll
around the site shows that many of the other houses have wide views
across the Firth of Forth to the islands of Inchgarvie, Inchcolm and
Inchkeith - as well as to Dalgety Bay on the Fife coast and across the
Forth to the Edinburgh.
The development has been designed around the craggy rock which stands
just to the east of North Queensferry. The houses face in different
directions to take advantage of the views from the site which wends its
way from the clifftop down to a secluded san dy beach. When The Herald
visited the site, the builders ignored the staff canteen at lunch time -
preferring to take their break al fresco on the clifftop where they
could admire the views.
As a small, specialist Fife builder, Punler considers himself
extremely lucky to have acquired one of the east of Scotland's most
interesting building sites. Formerly owned by the MOD for its strategic
location on a narrows over the Forth, the site has h ad planning consent
for residential use for the last 20 years but was never developed.
Since then part of the site has been designated a site of Special
Scientific Interest and will be administered by the Scottish Wildlife
Trust. ''We have made a donation to the Wildlife Trust so that they
could set up their arrangements for the site,'' says Keith Punler. ''Our
14 acres of residential land pokes into the SSSI at various places,
which means that buyers can be certain that there will no other
development in the area. What you see is what you get.''
And what you get in the first phase is a choice of five different
house styles. They range in price from #163,250 for a four bedroom
Arlington which comes with three public rooms, to #195,000 for the four
bedroom Westminster which has four bedrooms, thre e public rooms, and a
breakfast room next to the kitchen. Keith Punler is saving his finest
flourish for the last phase. Houses behind a secluded beach below the
cliff will cost between #350,000 to #400,000 - and will offer up to
4,500 sq ft of living space.
Such is the impact of the site on potential buyers that one customer
has bought a house in the second phase, even although it will not be
built for two years. ''It will cost them over #300,000 - and we didn't
offer a fixed price either,'' says Punler.
Most of the visitors to the site, which is very close to the rail
station at North Queensferry, come from Fife - but the people signing on
the dotted line come from across the Firth in the Edinburgh suburbs of
Barnton and Cramond. ''Most of the buyers so far have been ''empty
nesters' - people whose families have grown up and are looking for
something different. Interestingly, much of the interest so far has come
from people living in Barnton who want a smaller, but upmarket, house -
I'm thinking of dropp ing a leaflet through every letterbox in that part
of Edinburgh,'' says Punler.
A quantity surveyor by profession, he set up Manor Kingdom five years
ago - just when the recession was beginning to bite. ''The market has
always been depressed since we started trading,'' he says. ''People are
not moving up the scale in the way they used to, but you can achieve
sales if you offer quality homes on good location - that's the only way
to do it.''
His house styles are all designed in-house and the company makes its
own its own timber frames. ''Our buyers like a degree of exclusivity and
we hop e to offer them designs which they won't find elsewhere.
Externally we try to make the houses look indigenous to the area in
which they are built,'' he says.
One of the key selling points at his other development in Kinross is
the study, which is an integral part of many of Punler's designs. ''The
study is vital nowadays. Many people either work from home or bring work
back to do in the evenings or weekends. N obody wants their papers
scattered all over the house, so a study offers privacy as well as
organisations,'' he says.

Westpoint homes has pulled off a remarkable double. The small
specialist firm has provided something old and something new at its
development on a site between Cleveden Road and Beaconsfield Road, in
the West End.
When the site was acquired for two blocks of flats it came with
Kelvinside House, a traditional stone villa which had served for many
years as a private nursery and primary school.
With the encouragement of Glasgow's planning department, developer
Steph en Cullis decided to restore the old house and to design new
apartment blocks which would chime in with the leafy West End setting.
Kelvinside House was converted into seven apartments - five of which
were sold within the first week. Now with its stone cleaned, the
building is a fine landmark at the western edge of Kelvinside.
With 32 flat s at prices ranging from #89,000 to #117,000 Stephen
Cullis has been pleasantly surprised by how quickly his first West End
venture has gone. Only two flats remain for sale at a price of #104,950
each.
''The location has worked very well for us, the West End is full of
cosmopolitan people who want to live in an interesting area,'' he says.
''The planners insisted that a sensitive site like this should chime in
with the neighbourhood and we found that the design has been a big
selling point.''
It was when standing outside the nearby One Devonshire hotel that he
got his inspiration for the frontage of his apartment blocks.
''I told the architect to go and have a look at One Devonshire, it's a
famous hotel and eating place and it encapsulates the spirit of
traditional West End architecture. We then incorporated some of the
features into the frontage of our apartment blocks. You can't get more
West End than that,'' he says.
Sales manager Joanne Casey says that price played a big part in the
sales success. ''I reckon these are priced about #7,000 under their real
value - so we were not too surprised when they sold quickly. We did not
even have to open a showflat, such was the steady level of demand.''
Westpoint is now poised to start work on a former garden centre site
on Milngavie Road, Bearsden. Although work has not yet started, some 15
homes were sold within four weeks of the scheme being announced. When
complete next year The Laurels, as the deve lopment is called, will have
28 flats at prices ranging from #81,500 to #101,500.
After that, the company faces its biggest challenge. A site has been
acquired at Thorntonhall where six detached houses are planned.
''They're going to be huge,'' says Joanne Casey. ''They will all have
eight or nine apartments and be up to 3000sq ft in size. It's a great
location and we will be able to offer buyers individual designs to suit
their own preferences.''
Prices will be in the #250,000 to #300,000 bracket.

developments in the next few days. To coincide with the opening this
weekend of the movie ''Apollo 13', someone could achieve lift-off with a
free trip for two to the Epcot Centre at Disney World in Florida. The
competition marks Wimpey's success in launching 13 development sites
throughout the west of Scotland with a total value of some #53 m.
''The tie in with the Apollo 13 film is a fun way of increasing the
amount of people visiting our developments', says Ian Brown of Wimpey
Homes (Scotland West). ''Entry forms will be available in each of our
sales offices in the west of Scotland.''
The 13 developments are at various stages of production. Millcroft in
Neilston will have a total of 42 homes and Cragside View in Kilmarnock
will have 200. Both of these developments will open showhomes within the
next month Woodcote Gardens in Houston opened its showhomes last weekend
, where The Lea, a four bedroom detached home is on show. The
development is a mix of three and four bedroom detached homes.
The company's Kirkgrove site in Newton Mearns will consist of a
selection of four bedroom detached homes - The Lea, The Glover, and The
Dove - two of which have never been built before in Scotland.
''Kirkgrove will offer an exclusive development of four b edroom
detached homes. The Glover and The Dove have been available down south
and have both been popular with visitors and residents. We are confident
that this success will be mirrored in Scotland', says Ian Brown.
Prices start at Kirkgrove start from #129,995.
Meanwhile construction has started on four new sites: 94 homes are
being built at Glenavon Gate in Ferguslie Park, with two and three
bedroom semi-detached homes being built; at Watermill Grove in Paisley a
selection of two, three and four bedroom homes are under construction;
and work has begun at Sadlers gate in Kinning Park on a flatted
development on one, two and three bedroom flats; three bedroom bungalows
and four bedroom detached villas are being built at Blairmont Gardens in
Symington.
A total of 124 homes will be built in phase one at Briarcroft in
Robroyston, with work already started on site. The development will
offer a mix of two three and four bedroom homes.
''Briarcroft will be our flagship, with a total of eight showhomes on
the development,'' says Ian Brown.
''It is a substantial investment for the region and should reap
rewards not only with visitors interested in buying at Briarcroft but
those looking to buy on our other developments throughout the West of
Scotland.
''It is not feasible to open showhomes for each house type which will
be sold on a development and by creating a large show area at Briarcroft
potential buyers from across the region will be able to see the finished
product.''
The show area at Briarcroft will open in early 1996.

As he surveys his upmarket Hughenden development in Glasgow's West
End, Iain Stewart, sales director with Tay Homes, is satisfied that his
company has come through the worst of the recession. ''If you have good
locations and good prices your homes will sell. We've sold 160 flats and
townhouses at Hughenden right through a slow market - and the key
selling point has been its excellent location.''
Conceding that the market is still tough, he says that house builders
have had to adjust their product to meet what the puchaser wants. A
clutch of upmarket flats priced at over #200,000 at the entrance to the
Hughenden scheme has been quietly shelved until the top end of the
market comes back into full swing.
Similarly, half a dozen detached homes priced at #250,000 to #400,000
were put on the back burner with only one sold. ''We've succeeded here
by meeting what the market wants, and now we have only seven flats left
for sale with prices starting at #99,950. We've already started on a new
block of townhouses which will be priced at #150,000 to #180,000, so
we're confident that the market is still strong in Scotland,'' he says.
The company is also enjoying strong sales at the lower end of the
market in places like Castlemilk and Larkhall. Convinced that good
locations and good prices are the key to survival in the current market,
Tay Homes has been acquiring sites as diverse as East Kilbride, Dalgety
Bay, Ayrshire, Ruchazie, the Gorbals, and Hamilton.
''We're firmly committed to covering every part of the market, from
starter flats to homes at over #200,000. Our site at Smithycroft in
Hamilton has already taken nine reservations at prices between #150,000
to #180,000, yet we won't have any houses ready for occupation until the
spring or summer of next year. You have to work hard for every sale
nowadays, but there is a demand out there for good houses on good
locations.''

Forget the doom and gloom. One leading house builder is struggling to
keep up with demand at two developments in Lanarkshire.
Demand at Tilbury's ''Riverside' development in Airdrie has amazed
sales director Jan Jeram. She has been in the new homes business for 20
years and says that she has never before experienced the level of
interest being shown in this development.
''People have been thrusting money at us by way of deposits for the 31
detached homes planned for this development, ''' she says. ''We have a
waiting list of over 200 interested customers - and that has been
created simply by the erection of an information b oard on-site. We have
only recently received planning consent and are not in a position to
take deposits as yet. We are obviously delighted by the interest in
''Riverside', which will feature three and four bedroom detached homes
with panoramic views acro ss the countryside.'' Prices at Riverside
range from #78,495 to #97,995.
Nearby, the company's other airdrie development, Calderbank, is
proving to be equally popular. Due to customer demand, Tilbury has
changed its plans to incorporate styles requested by customers.
''We aim to give the customer what he or she wants. At Calderbank we
had a specific request for a bungalow as well as requests for our larger
four bedroom detached home. Neither house styles was on the original
plan, but we have since changed the plans to cope with customer
demand,'' she says.
The company's commitment to building a variety of house types to suit
buyers' individual needs is illustrated at its13 Scottish sites, which
will be extended by a further eight developments in the near future.
The company offers17 different house styles, ranging from single
bedroom apartments to large family homes.
Ignoring the speed and convenience of timber-frame construction,
Tilbury prefers to build in the traditional style - by laying one brick
upon another.
''Our methods may take a little longer, but the finished result is
well worth it,'' says Jan Jeram. ''We recently re-planned all of the
exterior finishes of our houses and introduced a lot of new elevations -
they are the same houses inside, but it has made them more attractive
and appealing. This has proved to be very successful.''
In a bid to make the purchase of a new house simple and stress-free,
Tilbury is offering various incentives.
For example, at the company's Wallace Glen development customers are
being given #4000 vouchers for Reid Furniture. Over the two month period
since the introduction of this offer around 20 homes were sold.
''It is our policy to make it as easy as possible for people to
purchase one of our houses and with this offer they can treat themselves
to furniture for their new home,'' says Jan Jeram.
The company has also devised a Key Move scheme which offers support to
buyers in selling their own home. Also on offer is an exclusive
opportunity of a 3.99% mortgage fixed for one year.
Currently there are Tilbury developments in Airdrie, Ayr, Baillieston,
Beith, Cumbernauld, Falkirk, Glenrothes, Johnstone, Livingston, Paisley,
Stirling, Strathaven and Troon.
The company has plans for developments in Baillieston, Coatbridge,
Edinburgh, Renfrew, Wishaw and second developments in Airdrie, Johnstone
and Paisley.
Tilbury Douglas recently released 10 building plots in Rhu
Helensburgh. The plots range from almost half an acre to one acres and
each will enjoy views across the Gareloach to Roseneath. Prices range
from #60,000 to #80,000.

THE Edinburgh Festival is over, folk have returned to normal life, but
the city is still buzzing from having to accommodate so many incomers.
Chestnut House, at Melville Castle in Midlothian, was soon snapped up
at a rental of #3000 a week. Because it was Festival time.
The place had its own swimming pool and could sleep up to 12. Visitors
to the capital were obviously keen to find a suitable place to enjoy
their time of music and drama.
''There are not quite so many visitors now looking for that size of
property,'' says Elaine Elliot, deputy general manager of Mackay's
Agency, which specialises in holiday property letting. ''There are still
lots of people coming to Edinburgh, of course,'' she adds.
''Some do prefer to wait until the Festival is over, to see the sights
or do their shopping, with perhaps more room to move about. That sort of
thing.''
The agency has been in business for about 25 years, and it has been
getting busier over the past few years. ''The recent heatwave helped
business immensely, and people seem to be going for two-centre holidays:
Edinburgh and Perthshire, Edinburgh and the Highlands, and so on.
''The sort of place you can get now varies from a rural cottage to a
detached property in Argyll. Your cottage has no electricity supply as
such, but there's Calor gas, an open fire, and we can arrange fishing if
you want. Sleeps five: around #165 a week.
''The larger property has an indoor pool, sauna, games room, motor
boat, rowing boat, golf course -- and electricity. Sleeps 16: around
#1550 a week. Everything in between, to suit all tastes. We cover the
whole of Scotland.''
What about the more usual situation, where people are looking for
reasonably long rental leases, probably on business rather than holiday?
Mark Cullerton, property manager with McKay and Norwell, solicitors and
estate agents in Edinburgh, offers a portfolio ranging from around #150
a month to #2000.
''If you take students as one group,'' he says, ''they will probably
look for a place in Marchmont, Newington, Bruntsfield and that general
area. They obviously want to be near the university.
''Probably they are ready to share and go for a three to five-bedroom
flat. That could be anything from #400 to #1000 a month in total.
''Some students may have a bad reputation, but we do not find that
works out in practice. They tend to be level-headed, fairly mature, and
not any particular problem.
''In the more expensive range of properties, you tend to get get the
executive on contract. Edinburgh is the main financial market after
London, and that is shown in the kind of property people look for.
''There are also people simply renting before buying. In any event,
the New Town area is popular for letting, with properties averaging
around #600 a month. You could look for a two-bedroom flat, fully
furnished, but not with parking space -- not in the city centre.
''Top of the range would be lets at #1000-2000 a month.

Park Court, Paisley, marking the final phase of 14 split level
semi-detached villas.

bathroom and additional toilet. Two of the bedrooms having fitted
wardrobes. The new homes also include driveways and landscaped front and
rear gardens.
Irene Glassey, sales manager or Miller Partnerships, said: ''We have

also within four miles of the M8 motorway, giving access to Glasgow and
the Clyde Coast.

Free sport and leisure facilities are part of the package at an
upmarket development in West Lothian. Muir Homes has released a further
phase at Deer Park in Livingston - and each of the homes comes with up
to three years free membership of the local gol f and country club - a
150 acre scheme which also offers swimming, ten-pin bowling, multi-gym,
and squash courts.
Prices for the 31 detached houses in the latest phase start at #79,995
for a three bedroom bungalow, rising to #198,500 for an eight-apartment
home. There are nine house styles to chose from, all of them with
integral or detached garages, en-suite bathro oms, fitted kitchens,
double glazing, and gas central heating. Modelled on a continental idea
of integrating housing with sport and leisure, Deer Park is unlike most
other new Scottish developments. It also has easy acccess to the M8 and
markets itself a t commuters to both Edinburgh and Glasgow who want
lifestyle which offers a high level of amenity.

While some builders chase sales by offering incentives by the
barrowload others refuse to compromise, preferring to let the quality of
their homes speak for themselves. Bryant homes, a builder from south of
the border which is laying the foundations for a major role in the
Scottish market, has adopted the strategy of concentrating at the
quality end of the market and insisting on a realistic price. and it
seems to be working for them.
''If you're selling the right house, with the right specification, in
the right place, then you don't have to worry about offers like free
carpets or curtains,'' says regional manager Marlyn Watt. ''Realistic
pricing ensures that our purchasers get value fo r money without the
need to resort to offering heavily discounted prices or part-exchange
deals. Freebies don't matter when you are buying a #150,000 house, it's
the product that counts. Scottish housebuyers are very discerning and
look beyond deals and sales gimmicks to the value of a quality home.''
The company believes that many buyers are now looking for a home which
provides a quality lifestyle, rather than viewing the purchase only as a
financial investment.
''Housing market conditions over recent years have created a more
demanding purchaser who will simply not compromise on style or quality.
Attractive design, extensive comfort and an efficient, economical home
have all become essential buying criteria', says Marlyn Watt.
Bryant Homes Scotland offers a range of upmarket three and four
bedroom properties on half a dozen sites throughout central Scotland.
Prices range from around #65,000 to #225,000.

Buyers keen to anchor themselves at Glasgow's Carrick Quay are having
to join a waiting list for some of the apartments.
Clarke Homes recently received planning permission to go full steam
ahead with the final phase of their #7M development overlooking the
Clyde.
Such has been the level of interest that the firm has had to open a
waiting list for two-bedroom apartments on the upper floors of the
development. ''Yet another indication of the steady recovery of
Scotland's housing market,'' says Clarke's regional direc tor Steve
Phillips.
''It's a long time since Scottish housebuilders enjoyed the luxury of
waiting lists of prospective owner-occupiers.''
Construction work is about to start of the final phase which comprises
43 properties, including a three-bedroom penthouse and a selection of
one and two bedroom apartments.
When completed, it will be the final touch to the Carrick Quay project
of 103 homes, the only development of its kind in the Glasgow inner-city
area.

Just when they thought it was safe to go back into the showhouses and
sales caravans, Scotland's house-builders are becoming nervous. The
troubled waters of the market are cut by the occasional glint of
something powerful prowling just under the surface.
But are we glimpsing the great white shark of the south rippling north
to bite into the sluggish Scottish market - or new shoals of potential
buyers gathering their courage for a leap upstream into new housing?
The truth is we don't yet know. But builders are a resilient bunch and
are optimistic that there is a pent-up demand for new housing which
could boost sales during the traditional autumn sales period.
There is a widespread consensus that while Scotland's property values
have not slumped like those in the South, the continuing absence of the
famously elusive 'feel-good factor' is eroding market confidence.
'You can't blame people for being a bit wary at the moment, but I've
got a feeling that everything will improve,' says Alan Downie of CALA
Homes. 'Let's get back to the numbers game. The population is increasing
and council housing is decreasing. Meanwhile people have higher
aspirations and everryone needs somewhere to live. Bricks and mortar are
always going to be vital.'
He believes that while the Scottish market is more flat than he would
like, it has not gone through the wild boom and bust pattern that
created negative equity and repossessions in the south.
'The peaks and troughs in the Scottish market are much shallower than
those in the south of England,' says Alan Downie of CALA Homes. 'Prices
in the south east have dropped by as much as 30% in places, but in
Scotland we have only seen a one or two point decrease at most. We
should be guided by what's happening in Scotland - not by the crash in
the south.'
After announcing strong profits a couple of weeks ago, CALA is forging
ahead with seven new developments scheduled for start before the end of
this year. 'Times are tough, but we have no fears about the future. We
are confident about our product and aim to build 800 houses this year,
which shows our longer term determination,' says Downie.
Builders like CALA, Bryant, Ambion, and Bett are showing that there is
a steady, if unexciting, demand at the upper end of the market. There
are also encouraging signs at the bottom. With its starter homes in
Castlemilk priced from #23,000 to just under #40,000 and its luxury West
End townhouses and flats at #100,000 and over, Tay Homes straddles the
whole breadth of the Scottish market.
'We are selling very well at the bottom end and we are confident about
the upper reaches of the market, but it's fair to say that the middle
sector is still fairly flat,' says Iain Stewart, Tay Homes sales
director.
One sign of that confidence is the fact that the company has quietly
downgraded its incentives for purchasers.
'It's still a buyers' market out there, but we want to sell from a
position of strength. We will only provide part exchange deals in areas
like
Ayrshire where the market is still very quiet. Elsewhere, we will
continue to offer our special mortgage deal and mortgage protection
insurance. But we're not making a big song and dance about incentives
anymore,' says Stewart. Another major builder, Persimmon Homes is hoping
that the traditional autumn increase in house sales will give a late
boost to this year's market, but according to chairman Duncan Davidson,
Government help is urgently needed to kick-start the feel-good factor.
Announcing half year figures depressed by squeezed margins he said
that although his company had enjoyed six weeks of satisfactory sales in
February and March, the market had weakened soon afterwards. 'Sadly, by
the middle of May it had evaporated. Since then trading conditions have
become progressively tougher. Traditionally, there is a seasonal upturn
in house sales during September and October. We are cautious about
forecasting such an upturn in 1995.
'In common with other housebuilders, Persimmon is experiencing an
increasing lack of confidence on the part of would be homebuyers for
various political and economic reasons.'
Although hit by the same market squeeze across the UK, Wimpey believes
that there is still a strong future in housebuilding and is bidding to
sieze an increased market share - especially in the light of Tarmac's
recent announcement that it intends to withdraw from house building,
despite being the UK's largest operator.
Along with the rest of the industry, Wimpey would like to see
government action to reduce interest rates or to cut the taxation on
home ownership.
Such intervention seems unlikely and the builders will have to rely on
cost-cutting measures to keep house sales moving. Which is good news for
buyers.
Although one or two of the more confident builders are shelving their
incentives, most are still keen to entice purchasers with part exchange
deals, assistance with selling their current homes, free furniture,
cut-price mortgages, and mortgage protection insurance.
With low interest rates and house prices that have stood still for a
couple of years now, the quiet optimism among Scotland's builders is
justified.
This is a very good time to buy a new house.

Although enjoying an 'outstanding' year, CALA Homes says that the
Scottish market has become more difficult. Issuing its annual report
earlier this month, the Falkirk-based builder reported sales of 253
units over the last 12 months at an average price o
f #139,000, compared with last year's 205 units at an average price of
#144,000. 'We expect units to increase in 1995/96, with an average price
planned to come down to nearer #130,000,' says Geoff Ball, managing
director of CALA plc. The reduction in ave
rage selling prices marks CALA's pragmatism. While the company intends
to continue building executive homes at the top end of the market, it is
also offering less expensive apartments in upmarket developments in
places like Glasgow's West End and Silverm
ills in Edinburgh. Prices at Silvermills will start at #60,000 for a
one bedroom flat.
The company's traditional executive homes are planned for a former
convent site at Briar Road in Newlands where prices will start at
#170,000. A nearby scheme at Sherbrooke Avenue has seen eight out of 17
homes sold at prices around #230,000. Balerno in
Edinburgh is the site of another upmarket executive scheme. The
company has also acquired a prestigious site in Alloway, close to Burns'
Cottage.With work scheduled to start on seven new sites before Christmas
CALA is determined to maintain its hold at t
he top, while reaching down into the #60,000 to #90,000 market.
'We're selling well at the top end of the market,' says Alan Downie,
chairman of CALA Homes. 'But there is a limited number of buyers in that
sector and we are determined to expand our business over the next five
years, so we're moving into the mid-marke
t.'

THE picture of bustling Argyle Street circa 1905 displayed inside the
doors of Glasgow's Tesco Metro store says it all -- High Street grocery
retailing is back, writes JONATHAN NORTHCROFT.
But shoppers coming to Tesco's city centre store encounter a quite
different world from that of the Edwardians seen thronging the sepia
print, one very much born of nineties retail philosophy and techniques.
Tesco publicity officer Kevin Charles yesterday described the success
of the company's 22 UK metro stores, three of which are in Scotland, as
being based on their ''distinctive and fashionable'' appeal.
Designed for modern lifestyles, he said, they concentrated on the
''basket trade'', catering for quick-stop office workers and city
shoppers popping in for a small number of items.
Tesco Metros are sized at between 10,000 and 15,000 sq ft, compared to
25,000 to 50,000 sq ft for out-of-town stores, and stock roughly half
the number of product lines. Bestsellers are sandwiches, wines, pasta
and ready meals.
The Argyle Street store, opened in 1994, caters for the basket shopper
in its design, with a series of short aisles placed off two central
walkways instead of the long, broad trolley aisles familiar at
out-of-town outlets.
On the store map, which represents shelf space as coloured blocks,
croissants get the same amount of room as bread, and ice-cream gets more
than milk and fresh meat combined.
Given prominent floor space are fresh flowers, fruit and vegetables,
with five varieties of lettuce on offer and 13 different pre-packed
salad assortments. Special lines include wine racks and celebration
cakes, although heavy goods such as refuse sacks and economy-size
washing powder are available.
Conspicuously absent among the shoppers are families with many
customers -- such as James Strachan -- coming from nearby offices. He
said he used the store for ''sheer convenience''.
However, there are also many pensioners. ''It's dead central, you can
get a bus here and you don't need a car,'' said Isa McIntyre, but she
added: ''It's not like the old High Street, though.''

ONE quarter of patients referred by their family doctor still have to
wait more than two months for a hospital appointment, according to new
figures published yesterday.
The annual report of the Scottish Health Service shows for the first
time relative yearly performance of trusts and how long people have to
wait before they even get on to a waiting list.
Hitherto, lists were regarded as over-optimistic by many patients
because they didn't include the GP referral period.
Aberdeen Royal Hospitals, one of the flagship trusts which this year
hit financial problems, fared badly in referral time (66% within nine
weeks) but managed better once patients had their appointment, treating
82% of them within three months.
People living in the Borders and Ayrshire and Arran achieved fastest
referrals (86% within nine weeks) and Grampian (68%) the slowest. For
actual hospital treatment within three months Borders, Grampian and
Argyll and Clyde fared the best (83%) and Dumfries and Galloway and
Ayrshire and Arran the worst (77%).
Launching the report, Scottish Health Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, said the detailed information for each trust would
help patients to choose their treatment with their GP.
He said the year had shown reductions in heart disease and cancer
deaths. More than 99% of patients were treated within local guaranteed
times, the number waiting more than a year had been halved, and 95% of
emergency ambulance calls were answered within targets.
''The report demonstrates very clearly that Scotland is feeling the
benefits of better health and of a health service that is becoming even
more effective in delivering services to patients,'' he said.
Questioned about potential rationing of some services, Lord James said
it was inevitable non-urgent cases like tatoo removals would take
longer.
However, the Government remained absolutely committed to providing
mainstream health services where treatment would continue to be on the
basis of need and free at the point of delivery.
He said doctors, nurses, and other staff had done a tremendous job in
treating 5% more patients and reducing waiting times last year, but he
had nothing new to say on pay awards deadlocked since April.
This brought an angry reaction from health unions.
Ms June Andrews, Scottish Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
which remains opposed to local bargaining, said: ''We are being quite
reasonable. We do not insist on the 5% we have earned, only the 3%
without strings we have asked for.''
A spokeswoman for the British Medical Association said the effects of
the recent reforms had squeezed the NHS to such an extent it was
vulnerable to the slightest crisis like a flu epidemic or illness of key
staff.

In day three of our series, Jennifer Cunningham and Gavin Bell look at
how properly managed community care, holiday deals, and the lastest
technology can add elements of freedom to the lives of the elderly
TO BE blunt, applying the philosophy of community care to elderly
people in long-stay hospitals is an easier task than for any other
group. To shift gear in the pattern of available care requires only a
wait until those in long-stay beds die off rather than a complex
transfer operation.
Even so, the numbers in residential care and nursing home care will
continue to rise.
Take Glasgow as an example of what is likely to happen during the next
few years. The population of the city will continue to decrease as the
proportion of both the aged and the vulnerable elderly increases. In the
next three years the number of people aged over 75 in the Greater
Glasgow area will increase by 1%, amounting to 400 people. At present
12% of them are in institutional care.
The social work department has a rule of thumb indicator of
vulnerability which includes everyone who meets two of the three
criteria of being over 75, living alone, and receiving Income Support.
There will be a broad transfer of money from the health service to the
social work departments from #737,000 in 1994-95 to #6,042,000 in
1997-98, bringing the total cost of purchasing social care for the
elderly in Glasgow alone to more than #11m.
Concern among the owners of private residential and nursing homes that
the change to community-based services could put them out of business is
unwarranted, according to Bob Winter, deputy director of social work
with a special responsibility for community services. His research shows
that the growth in the number of private sector nursing home places will
continue.
Between 1990 and 1995 there was an increase of 121%. A further 760
places are planned for 1995-96 for Eastwood, Bearsden, and Milngavie,
areas which already have the highest provision, reflecting longer
average lifespans.
The whole idea of community care is that people now have the option to
stay at home because home care services can provide personal care such
as help with getting up and getting to bed. What the social workers hope
will result from their new requirement to assess everyone who does not
cover the entire cost of their care themselves is that people will be
offered a package tailored to their individual needs.
''We know that before April 1993 people were inappropriately provided
for in all sectors. Some of the most dependent people were at home and
some people in dependent forms of care did not require to be there,''
said Winter, adding the assurance that elderly people already in care
would not be re-assessed.
Advances in alarm systems plus increased home care means that ordinary
houses can be turned into sheltered houses. Glasgow District Council has
spent #7.7m on alarm systems in three years. The development of
concierge systems has had the effect of turning some high-rise blocks
into a quiet, self-contained haven for elderly people. In turn, that has
prompted the social work department to devolve the organisation of its
home-help services to a local level. In a multi-storey block, for
example, home help employees now work as a team, deciding the priorities
on the basis of their practical knowledge of the needs of individuals
and getting to know most of the clients so that they can cover for
holidays and absences with continuity.
By the year 1997-98, Glasgow's annual bill for community care for the
elderly will be #11.3m, the majority of it home-based care. ''It is not
set in aspic, but will be changed if we find, for example, that more
people need nursing-home care. It is not place-driven, but
need-driven,'' said Winter. ''We cannot plan nursing-home provision
because it is a private sector initiative, but by holding meetings
involving the private sector we hope they will come and talk to us.''
The simple arithmetic says a lot. In the past 15 years the number of
people dependent on the home-help service has increased by 46% and the
number of home helps has increased by 9%. The effect on the service and
on the people who carry it out hardly needs to be stated.
What the statistics fail to show is that home helps no longer just do
a bit of light housework and assist with shopping but provide vital
personal care for clients who are increasingly frail.
The first examination of how home care has developed since the Care in
the Community legislation came into effect has just been completed by
Age Concern Scotland. It reveals an almost scandalous picture of old
people as tasks to be ticked off an ever-lengthening list by carers for
whom keeping to the timetable has become more important than giving the
time of day. Despite praise for individuals, common comments were
''she's always in a rush''.
As a result of a postal questionnaire sent to 158 home-help users in
nine different authorities, backed up by interviews, Age Concern has
drawn up 20 recommendations. They show that the service needs a radical
overhaul to meet the real needs of its users. A simple example is proper
insurance so that home helps can change a light bulb.
More basic is whether the level of help matches the assessment of the
client's need. Maureen O'Neill, director of Age Concern, would like to
see regular re-assessment to reflect changing circumstances and suggests
that home-care organisers should meet clients at least every six months.
The survey found such discrepancy between authorities, between what
home helps were and were not allowed to do, between charges made to the
service users, and between the level of importance attached to
continuity of care, and that national guidelines are a necessity,
particularly with the impending fragmentation of local government.
The sheer relief at being able to stay in their own homes is a measure
of the vital nature of the service. ''I could not live without a home
help and I'm terribly, terribly grateful,'' is typical despite the
problems of lack of time and a reduction in hours.

THE traditional autumn increase in house sales holds the best hopes
for a recovery in the housing market, but Government help is urgently
needed to kick-start the feel-good factor according to one of the UK's
leading builders.
Announcing half year figures depressed by squeezed margins Duncan
Davidson, chairman of UK housebuilder Persimmon plc, parent company of
Hamilton-based Persimmon Homes (Scotland) Ltd, said that although his
company had enjoyed six weeks of satisfactory sales in February and
March, the market had weakened soon afterwards.
''Sadly, by the middle of May it had evaporated. Since then trading
conditions have become progressively tougher. Traditionally, there is a
seasonal upturn in house sales during September and October. We are
cautious about forecasting such an upturn in 1995. Persimmon's results
for the full year obviously depended upon the extent of any improvement
in our market. In common with other housebuilders, Persimmon is
experiencing an increasing lack of confidence on the part of would be
homebuyers for various political and economic reasons.''
Persimmon's net pre-tax profit for the six months to June 30, 1995 is
#10.2 million, which is 10% lower than its profit of #11.3 million in
the first six months of 1994. The company has increased the number of
houses legally completed in the period to 1676 (1994: 1443). However,
margins have come under pressure, particularly in the area of selling
costs. As a result, operating margins were 11.3% in the first half of
1995, as compared with 13.1% in the first half of 1994.
While major builders such as Tarmac and Balfour Beatty are withdrawing
from the house building sector, there are opportunities for expansion
among other firms. ''If there is a reduction in the number of
substantial housebuilders in the UK, this should assist Persimmon in
achieving its aim of a continued rise in market share. In the meantime,
our landbank remains strong at over 17,000 plots with planning consent
and our balance sheet is sound with gearing at 30%,'' said Davidson.

Profound changes are taking place in the UK housing market, and they
will have an important impact on Scotland. Continuing low inflation is
removing the uplift in property values which used to provide the
funding, and the incentive, for trading up into a larger home. Although
Scotland is not affected by negative equity, the government's success in
keeping inflation down is putting a brake on the property market
throughout the UK.
But as builders, lenders, estate agents, buyers, and sellers all
grapple with the changes, the government is failing to handle the
transition effectively according to a senior pundit from the mortgage
industry.
''There is a fundamental change going on in the housing market, but we
don't know whether it is permanent or cyclical. We're moving into
uncharted waters,'' says Doctor Peter Williams of the Council of
Mortgage Lenders which speaks for the banks and buildi ng societies.
Addressing senior housing market researchers and economists at Glasgow
University a few days ago, he said that some of the lessons of the
property crash had been learned by borrowers and lenders - but the
government was slower in coming to terms with the new realities of the
market.
Aware that they are taking a risk, people entering the property market
have become much more cautious about the size of loan they are prepared
to take on - and they are not in a hurry to buy. The rental sector could
be boosted by people postponing their property purchase.
''People still want to become home owners - the question is when,''
says Williams. ''Now that houses are seen as consumption goods, rather
than investment goods, it would suggest an increased demand for private
and public rental accommodation.''
Convinced that long term change in housing expectations and market
activity is taking place, he urges the property industry to come to
terms with the new realities as soon as possible.
At the peak of the market in 1988-89 there were some 2.1 million hous
ing transactions in the UK. The prediction for the year 2000 is some1.6
million transactions, only three-quarters of the activity level of the
boom.
Although negative is largely a problem for the south, Williams
believes that the whole of the UK, including Scotland, is being affected
by ''a lack of positive equity.''
If prices are standing still then home owners are not building up the
positive equity which smooths the cost of moving home - legal fees,
surveys, stamp duty, and marketing costs for current home become an
important disincentive to move. ''The cosy cushion in the world of home
ownership has gone, buyers can no longer expect sudden increase s in the
value of their homes.''
Since Scotland was not as hard hit as the rest of the UK by the slump,
the local market is probably better-placed to cope with the changes.
''The Scottish market is not as risky as that of the rest of the UK, so
things look slightly more positive north o f the Border. But the
profound changes taking place in house values, the job market, and the
economy will mean that the Scottish market will also be affected,'' says
Williams.
He wonders whether we will see a return to the norms of the 1950s when
people rarely bought houses which cost more than three times their
salary. The price/income ratio has stood at between 3.5 and 4 since
1960.
''But if inflation stays low you could expe ct people to opt for a
lower price/income ratio, so they won't have so much debt. And if the
ratio is going to back to below 3, then it's clear that we've still got
some way to go before we get there. Unfortunately, the government is not
handling the tra nsition very well, the long term market is being
mishandled.''
He went on to express his concern about those building societies which
were prepared to offer to offer ''cashback' deals to attract new
borrowers. The highest he had seen was a #17,500 cashback offer to
people borrowing high sums.''
It's a weird market when people give you money so that you can borrow
from them! There is a danger of attracting poorer customers who are less
able to repay their mortgages when you offer cash incentives.'' On the
brighter side, he predicted that somewhere between 400,000 and 450,000
first time buyers will be entering the UK market every year for the next
decade.
''Although there are great changes sweeping through the housing
market, the world has not ended. There are very good prospects, despite
labour market adjustments which are making people less secure about
their jobs.''
He also predicted that lenders will pay more attention to their
existing borrowers. The focus has traditionally been on first time
buyers, but banks and building societies are waking up to the realistion
that a great many of their existing borrowers have survived a boom and a
slump. ''The recession has provided a wonderful data-set for lenders.
They've seen their customers tested to the limit, so they now have a
much better as to who are the most reliable borrowers.''
But lenders will have to work harder to hold on to their customers.
''We're now seeing the rise of the ''promiscuous' home owner. Whereas
borrowers used to have a monogamous relationship with their lender, they
are now prepared to move their loan in search of new mortgage products,
fixed rate offers, and lower priced rates.
'' The lending market will become much more turbulent as a result.''

* ENGLISH clubs face forfeiting a European place next season following
UEFA's decision to launch a probe into this summer's Inter-Toto Cup
shambles.
FA chief executive Graham Kelly and chairman Sir Bert Millichip flew
to a meeting in Portugal yesterday hoping to hear that England had been
granted an additional place in the UEFA Cup for the second successive
season because of the nation's Fair Play record.
But they came away under threat that there could be one less English
side granted a UEFA Cup place next season.
A statement from UEFA read: ''Reviewing the first edition of the UEFA
Inter-Toto Cup, the executive committee decided to ask the control and
disciplinary committee, as well as the Fair Play and club competitions
committee, to deal with the conduct of English clubs.''
It is understood that some European officials are less than happy with
events surrounding the half-hearted involvement of Sheffield Wednesday,
Tottenham, and Wimbledon in their close-season competition.
Leeds benefited from the Fair Play place this season when England's
representation in the UEFA Cup was increased to four places.
Now, it looks as though it could revert to three unless Kelly and
Millichip can satisfy the UEFA investigators.

BARINGS Bank administrators said yesterday they had started legal
proceedings against Nick Leeson, the futures trader blamed for the #860m
losses that broke the bank, to ensure he did not profit from selling his
story.
But they dismissed rumours they were prepared to pursue anyone who
might benifit from Leeson's story -- including his wife Lisa -- saying
no other writs were being prepared.
A spokesman for the administrators said the writ did not specify any
sum of money. ''The administrators instructed solicitors to lodge a writ
in the High Court, which is a protective measure,'' he said.
''If the writ were to be served and if action were taken and if they
were to win the action, then there would be the question of damages and
they would look to personal assets but that would be a long time off,''
said the spokesman.
Leeson's lawyer, Mr Stephen Pollard, of Kingsley Napley, said the writ
was a standard protective measure.

LABOUR was attacked last night for ''an affront to democracy'' over
comments equating the SNP with terrorism made on the eve of the
Nationalist conference in Perth.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson, meeting party colleagues
earlier in the day, had pitched a warning which referred to the ''dark
side of nationalism'' and spoke of terrorist threats by nationalist
extremists.
The SNP hierarchy, gathering in Perth last night, expressed their
outrage at what they saw as a blatant attempt to undermine their annual
conference.
The party's chief executive, Mr Michael Russell, said: ''Democracy is
very precious and democratic parties should be making common cause
against extremists instead of making cheap points against other
political parties who have never endorsed racism.''
The Shadow Secretary of State expressed surprise that an internal
party document had been leaked at this time but he did not back away
from its contents. He confirmed that he was the author of the report
referring to the ''dark side of nationalism'' and he was happy to link
this to recent cases involving threats and intimidation by Nationalist
extremists.
He accepted that the SNP had disowned such groupings but said: ''Those
of us, and there are a number who have been recipients of letter bombs
and death threats, need to make people aware of the darker side of
nationalism.''
He accused the SNP of standing back from extremists and said the fact
that an extremist fringe existed fed on their rhetoric and prejudice.
He also drew attention to recent comments by west coast councillor Jim
Mitchell describing Labour as traitors and Uncle Toms, saying the SNP
leadership had to condemn this kind of language.

* FORMER Celtic star Danny Crainie's Highland fling is over. The
31-year-old midfielder played his last game for Ross County against
Albion Rovers on Saturday.
County manager Bobby Wilson, who had the player on month-to-month
contracts, has club captain Cammie Robertson back in action to fill the
wide left role.
Wilson said: ''I had a chat with Danny after the Albion Rovers game on
Saturday, and we agreed, mutually, to part company. I didn't see any
point in bringing him north from Glasgow when Cammie's return means I
can't guarantee him a place.''
Robertson's return is a big boost to the Dingwall men. He was
unavailable for most of last season because of offshore work in the
North Sea oil industry.

WE are just two weeks into the brave new world of Open Rugby and I
hear some people are wishing to close the doors. There are, it is
suggested, too many foreign imports in our top teams, local lads are
being denied a chance, the SRU should step in to protect our players.
That is utter humbug in my opinion.
Let us begin with the statistics. There are just over 30 new overseas
players in Scottish rugby this season. Not in the four premier divisions
but throughout the entire country.
The SRU already has restrictions in place. In cup or championship
matches clubs can field only ''two foreigners'' although there are
exceptions to that rule. Players with Scottish eligibility -- and that
is now being rigorously checked by the way -- are exempt as are players
who have been resident in Scotland for two years and those who have
played in the championship in either of the two seasons immediately
prior to 1993.
So there is no invasion from lands afar, nor is there any need for
further legislation. But that is not the main point.
Professional rugby, which the same folk who are doing the moaning told
us was inevitable and a jolly good thing, means that players hire out
their services to the highest bidder.
That may be unpalatable but it is most certainly a fact.
In seasons to come, and most definitely when Scotland enters European
competition, players will be enticed here from South Africa, New
Zealand, and Australia; we may even have some South Sea islanders who
suddenly discover they have Scottish relatives (birth certificates,
required). Hopefully the traffic will not be all one way -- there are a
good few Scots who would benefit from a term Down Under.
But is this something of which to be afraid? I don't believe so. If
Gavin Hastings has persuaded Sean Fitzpatrick, the All Blacks' captain,
to come to Myreside the whole of the Scottish game would have been the
richer.
The club's sponsor would have put in more money, the gates would have
risen and all the Watsonian regulars, particularly the youngsters, could
have learned at the feet of one of the all-time greats. As for the lad
displaced at hooker, he might well have picked up a tip or two from Sean
that would have boosted his career.
There is only one way Scotland are going to be able to compete at the
highest level and that is by improving the standard of our own domestic
game. Good players help to do just that.
Is anyone seriously arguing that Scottish football would be helped by
the absense of such as Brian Laudrup, Oleg Salenko, Theo Snelders,
Pierre Van Hooydonk or Andreas Thom?
Should Paul Gascoigne be sent packing because he is not a qualified
Scot?
I was struck by the comments of Rangers' Charlie Miller as recorded by
Ian Paul on Monday. Far from resenting the arrival of the hirsute hero
at Ibrox, Miller observed: ''He (Gascoigne) is probably the best player
in Scotland already, along with Brian Laudrup. He has always been good
to me, helping me a lot and he wants to see me do my best.''
That is the attitude which Scottish rugby players should adopt --
look, learn, then make the team on merit. It is quite wrong to label
overseas players as ''mercenaries''; they are just young men making the
best of their sporting ability.
I suspect the game of rugby football will change dramatically in the
next decade. Laws will be altered as the demand grows for a more
entertaining sport for the spectators. I suspect I shall not like all of
the changes.
But of this I am certain -- professionalism can never mean
protectionism. There is no chance of foreigners taking over our domestic
game, there is simply not the cash to pay them.
We should pick up all we can from the ones who are here.
Rugby Not-So-Special
GALA coach Peter Dods is never a man to be shy of giving his opinion.
He told me on Saturday he considered the BBC's Rugby Special programme
to be ''a poor advert for our game.''
That is probably a wee bit harsh -- the two Johns, Beattie and
Jeffrey, do their best to liven it up -- but the format is very
predictable. I mean, if the Hawick-Boroughmuir game was so bad, did we
have to have so much of it?
As for the ''brownie box'' film of the Edinburgh Academicals-Heriot FP
game, it made the early Chaplin movies appear bang up-to-date.
Hall of fame in making
I HAVE had the pleasure of meeting Sir John Hall on several occasions
and have absolutely no doubt that he will turn Newcastle into a major
force on the rugby scene just as he has done with his beloved United.
As one of the current Scottish international squad observed to me this
week: ''It is a very short drive to Newcastle from my house.''
He could have a full car.

'Everyone hopes that the last has been heard of the worst excesses of
partisanship'
ADOPTING attitudes at clear variance with one another, which may well
also be a reflection of the differences in basic philosophies, Ian
Woosnam yesterday took a gloomy view of the future of the Ryder Cup
match if Europe lost to the United States again this weekend, whereas
Peter Jacobsen was emphatically positive in this opinion.
As practice continued in bright and warm autumn weather at the Oak
Hill Club's course near Rochester, in upper New York State, Woosnam,
recruited for his seventh appearance at the eleventh hour to replace the
disabled Jose Maria Olazabal, said: ''We're under a lot of pressure,
because if we don't win, the match will start sliding downhill to its
level of the 1960s and 1970s.''
But Jacobsen, marking his return after an absence of over 10 years,
rejected that opinion. ''The Ryder Cup is not just about winning and
losing, although it will probably come to that on Sunday.
''It's a celebration of what golf has become around the world and of
the achievements of the team's members. It strengthens the game and
encourages future generations of professionals.''
Another of the Americans, Jay Haas, supported his compatriot, as well
he might since his only previous experience of the biennial contest was
in 1983 when the American golfing public's interest was at its lowest
ebb, following six consecutive and resounding victories for the United
States.
''I'd be surprised if there were 10,000 spectators all week at Palm
Beach Gardens,'' Haas reflected, an encounter which, in fact, was to
become a watershed in the history of the series which began 68 years
ago. Two victories apiece and a tie in the next five duels whetted the
appetites of the media and the public alike.
So much so that that modest attendance of 12 years ago will be
completely eclipsed again. On the three days of the match, which begins
on Friday, 25,000 season ticket-holders and 5000 who pay for admission
daily will crowd the course's 6902 yards, through the tall stands of
trees which closely hem the narrow fairways.
Obviously everyone hopes that the last has indeed been heard of the
worst excesses of partisanship which marred the four matches before the
last one. At The Belfry two years ago discipline was largely restored
and the players and their respective captains, Bernard Gallacher and
Lanny Wadkins, expect no less restraint this time.
Speaking for himself, Gallacher has told his players to expect the
galleries to be ''big, noisy and patriotic''. He has said, however, that
he does not expect the ''War on the Shore'' raucousness and jingoism
which erupted at Kiawah Island four years ago because ''this is a club
with tradition which will attract similar golf supporters.''
Indeed, Jacobsen, by nature the extrovert sort, asserted that he would
not hesitate to remonstrate personally if he thought that support had
become too impressioned, especially if it descended to cheering a
destructive shot or a missed putt -- not unlikely eventualities given
the unrelenting rigours of the course.
In that regard the sight was hardly reassuring of Severiano
Ballesteros, Nick Faldo, and Costantino Rocca awarding themselves
Mulligans on the first tee. Only Colin Montgomerie was satisfied with
his first drive, that of Ballesteros having clattered into trees in the
direction a cricketer might describe as bisecting the field between
mid-wicket and mid-on.
A guide to Gallacher's thinking on the pairings was offered as follows
-- the Old Firms of Faldo and Montgomerie and Woosnam and Bernhard
Langer, which in foursomes and fourballs in 1993 took four-and-a-half
points from a possible six and the new ones of Ballesteros and Rocca,
Sam Torrance and Philip Walton, David Gilford and Mark James, and Howard
Clark and Per-Ulrik Johansson.
Thus Torrance, newly restored to the leadership for the European order
of merit and Clark, without a victory for seven years and whose last
outing in this event was in 1989, partnered the two newcomers to the
side. Coincidentally or not, both Torrance and Walton, respectively
winners three times and twice this season, wield long-handled putters.
Faldo, who in the wake of press stories alleging problems with his
second marriage would take ''no questions of a personal nature,'' was
otherwise sanguine. ''We have a lot of straight players who enjoy the
challenge of a tough course,'' he declared.
Expanding on that theme, Woosnam concluded: ''All that matters is
defection of the cup back to Europe so it's important to have the
pairings right to support our enthusiasm on and off the course.
''What gives me inspiration is the determination not to let the others
down -- a very different situation to playing only for ourselves.''

AMBITIOUS third division club Preston Lodge FP, who yesterday stated
their intention to be in rugby's top flight, have conceded they may have
to pay young players if they are to prevent an outflow of home-grown
talent to predatory first division sides in nearby Edinburgh.
''If that is what it takes then we will not be left behind,'' said Ken
Stewart, the Preston Lodge fund-raising convener who yesterday announced
sponsorship deals worth #63,000 and a raft of exciting developments at
the club's ground.
Around #30,000 of the sponsorship will come from the Cambuslang-based
company, Initial Textiles Services, and will be used for the club's
extensive youth development programme. Yesterday, Keith Hare, of Initial
Textiles Services, revealed that his company had been looking to sponsor
a ''progressive club and one involved in the community and with
schools''. Preston Lodge FP matched these requirements perfectly.
One specific area of help will be the supply of kit to all of Preston
Lodge FP's youth, colts, mini, and midi sides and sweatshirts for every
player in the first three years at Preston Lodge High School.
The other half of the cash bounty will come from match sponsorship,
peripheral and programme advertising, and team sponsorship, funded
largely by local businesses and indicative of the relationship the club
enjoys with the community.
Preston Lodge FP have also introduced a job placement scheme for their
young players in a further effort to retain their youth players.
* FORMER international flanker Jean-Claude Skrela has replaced Pierre
Berbizier as France's rugby union coach.
Berbizier, who led France to third place in last summer's World Cup,
said he had resigned because he disagreed with FFR president Bernard
Lapasset's policies.

SRI Lanka bounced back from defeat in the first Test and snatched a
42-run success against Pakistan to level the three-match series
yesterday in Faisalabad.
Pakistan, needing 252 to win, were dismissed for 209 on the final day,
losing their last three wickets for three runs.
Sri Lanka's first Test victory in Pakistan was sealed by left-arm pace
bowler Chaminda Vaas, who finished with four for 45, and off-spinner
Kumara Dharmasena, who captured three for 43.
Muttiah Muralitharan's off-spin was also a telling factor, earning two
for 83 and a total haul of seven for 151 that earned him the man of the
match award.
Pakistan, who won the first Test at Peshawar by an innings and 40
runs, were unable to cope with the pressure and continued to lose
wickets at frequent intervals after having resumed at an overnight 58
for two.
The only batsmen to defy the Sri Lankan attack were Saeed Anwar and
Moin Khan, who made 50.
Saeed, who resumed on 30, went after having completed his second
half-century of the game, bowled by Dharmasena. Shoaib Mohammad fell
cheaply and Muralitharan snapped up the crucial wicket of
Inzamam-ul-Haq, caught and bowled for 26.
The departure of Moin was a critical blow. He was smarly caught by
Muralitharan from a delivery by Vaas that lifted sharply. ''It was a
team effort which earned us a wonderful victory.'' said Sri Lankan
captain Arjuna Ranatunga. ''It was a tremendous endeavour coming back
from defeat at Peshawar.''
Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja said: ''Our batting in the second innings
was not up to expectations. We badly missed Wasim Akram, who could not
bowl (in the second innings) because of a sore shoulder.''
The third and final Test starts in Sialkot on Friday.

HOME INTERNATIONALS:
SCOTLAND launch their challenge in the home internationals at Royal
Portrush, Northern Ireland, today against the host country as firm
favourites to triumph and end a miserable past playing record. They were
last victorious in 1986 and have performed poorly since.
With four players in the 11-strong side which won the Walker Cup a
fortnight ago, hopes are high. Six of the side also helped land the
European Team championships at Royal Antwerp in July.
The unusual front-runners' mantle does not bother non-playing captain
Colin Dalgleish, himself a former Walker Cup cap, who was ''very
optimistic'' about his side's chances across these beautifully prepared
Antrim links. ''We were labelled favourites following the strokeplay
section of the European Team championships and we certainly managed to
carry that tag well,'' he said.
Holders England, also field four Walker Cup caps. Ireland, too, will
be bolstered by the showing of their contingent in the biennial clash.
Scotland have opted to break from their tried-and-tested foursomes
pairings in an effort to ''spread experience'' and Amateur champion
Gordon Sherry and St Andrews Links winner Graham Rankin form a fearsome
front pairing.
This event is the international swansong of both Stephen Gallacher and
Barclay Howard. Gallacher plans to turn professional while Howard will
turn his attention to finding full-time employment. Today's pairings:
FOURSOMES
J Fanagan (Milltown) and P Harrington (Stackstown) v G Sherry
(Kilmarnock Barassie) and G Rankin (Palacerigg); K Nolan (Bray) and G
McGimpsey (Bangor) v S Gallacher (Bathgate) and S MacKenzie (West
Linton); B Omelia (Newlands) and E Brady (Royal Dublin) v A Reid
(Kilmarnock Barassie) and C Watson (East Renfrewshire); J Morris
(Douglas) and P Murray (Tipperary) v M Brooks (Carluke) and H McKibbin
(Troon Welbeck); K Kearney (Co Sligo) and G Murphy (Kilkenny) v B Howard
(Cochrane Castle) and A Turnbull (Innerleithen).
SINGLES
Harrington v Sherry; Fanagan v MacKenzie; Nolan v Gallacher; McGimpsey
v Rankin; E Power (Tramore) v Howard; Brady v Watson; Morris v R Beames
(Wick); Omelia v Turnbull; Murphy v Reid; Kearney v McKibbin.
* CAWDER'S Alan Tait carded a six-under-par 65 to win the Parkdean
Pro-Am at Ayr Belleisle yesterday. Leading scores:
65 -- A Tait (Cawder). 67 -- C Fergusson (Troon); B Marchbank
(Marchbank Golf Enterprises). 68 -- R Arnott (Caddy Shack); I Young
(Braid Hills), C Elliott (Dubai Creek), R Weir (Cowal). Team: 57 -- B
Dunbar (Easter Moffat) A Hughes, C Dykes, D Semple.
* NORTHERN Counties defeated Dunbartonshire 5-4 while Fife beat
Borders 8-1 yesterday at the SLGA County Finals at Prestonfield.
* ANN Laing, a 20-year-old Vale of Leven player, will gain her first
full Scotland cap after being called up for the women's home
internationals at Wrexham from October 4 to 6 in place of Fiona McKay
(Turnberry), who has been unable to secure time off work.

RETAILING
THE list of well-known brand names at Sears, which recently sold 245
Freeman Hardy Willis, Trueform and Manfield shoe shops to entrepreneur
Stephen Hinchcliffe's retail group Facia, is extensive.
So is the group's capacity for disappointing the market. And the
half-year figures yesterday were no exception, leaving the share price
7[1/2]p lower at 108[1/2]p after a slump in profits and a warning about
second-half prospects, the second profit warning in three months.
Chairman Sir Bob Reid, a former chairman of British Rail, said the
company had a disappointing six months with trading profits falling 27%
to #30.3m, which included a #2.3m first-time acquisition contribution.
Footwear and sports and leisurewear suffered from the increased cost of
clearing surplus goods as well as of restructuring.
Freemans, Selfridges, Adams, Wallis, Richards and Warehouse are
described as having ''performed well'' in a depressed retail market.
However, Selfridges, the High Street flagship, managed an 11.3% sales
increase with profits up 20.9% to #11m.
Like-for-like sales in footwear did increase by 2.6% but profits
slumped from #10.9m to just #2m on sales of #286.8m.
However, Sears, led by chief executive Liam Strong, said its new
formats -- Shoe City, Shoe Express and Hush Puppies -- continued to
achieve good results despite a lower level of consumer activity. The
newest format, Shoe Connection, which is targeted at the middle market,
is ''performing well''.
Looking to the second half, though, the picture becomes really dismal.
Businesses are not doing as well in terms of sales as in the first half,
limited as that was in most cases. In August like-for-like sales dived
by 10% and are currently running 6% lower. ''In light of that, we remain
cautious about second-half profits,'' said the chairman.
Analysts yesterday were busy cutting their full-year projections for
the group. Sears itself is confident it is well placed to take advantage
of any improvement in consumer spend that may come through in the last
quarter of the year.

MIDLAND Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and
other titles, has raised profits by 23% to #9.4m in the first six months
of the year, but it expects a tougher second half because of spiralling
newsprint costs, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Chief executive Chris Oakley explained that the cost of newsprint (the
paper on which newspapers are printed) went up between 10% and 15% in
January and some manufacturers followed this by further increases of 25%
to 35% in the summer. These were considerably higher than expected a
year ago and added #3m to the group's costs over a full year. However,
supply shortages are now easing, and action is being taken to save
newsprint and reduce costs.
Circulations of the main paid-for titles have improved slightly and
the group is concentrating on improving advertising yields by reducing
discounts and discouraging low-priced volume advertising.
Recruitment advertising performed strongly, but categories relating to
consumer demand, especially housing, showed a slowing of activity in the
last two months of the period.
Midland's interest in Live TV, the 24-hour cable channel, will soon
start bearing fruit as its input will be screened in the Birmingham
cable area from November. It is also a partner with BT in a Milton
Keynes cable broadcasting operation.
The group sees further growth in recruitment advertising in the rest
of the year, though consumer sections will remain subdued.
The interim dividend is raised by 9% to 1.2p.

BRITAIN'S dairy farmers were urged to start a campaign to scrap the
European milk quota regime by a leading adviser yesterday.
Speaking on the eve of the two-day European dairy farming event in
Warwickshire, David Sumner, head of dairy development with the
Agriculture Development and Advisory Service, said the sooner the regime
was scrapped the better off the industry would be.
He said the results of a straw poll he conducted this summer showed
only a handful of the 450 dairy farmers were in favour of ending quotas,
introduced in 1984 to curb over production across Europe.
But they should ask themselves if they really want to go into a new
decade with a constraint on output ''when our major competitors in
America, Australia and New Zealand are all looking to expand production
quite aggressively''.
He admitted that quotas provided a security net for producers,
particularly as their market value was around 60p per litre in the UK.
Not all European countries had attached the value to quota although many
were moving in that direction.
This meant that if quotas were phased out it was possible the European
Commission would introduce some form of compensation. Alternatively
there could be an intermediate stage where quota was tradeable across
national borders.
But the debate had to start now, he told a national dairy conference
in Birmingham organised by the Plunkett Foundation. Farmers'
organisations and perhaps even the Government had to take this up
quickly so that by 1999 there was a concensus on future direction.
He predicted there would be serious structural change in the UK
industry in any case with the number of dairy farmers in England and
Wales falling from 28,000 now to nearer 20,000 by the year 2000. The
processing industry would also be affected.
In spite of this he remained bullish about the future of the industry.
''The UK dairy industry has a great deal going for it. It has climatic
and structural advantages plus availability of leading edge technology.
It has a product which is in demand.
''Yet it is a dynamic milk world, changing rapidly, and UK farmers
must change also and meet the challenges that lie ahead. The
opportunities to improve business, and enterprise strength are
considerable for most and producers individually or collectively are
well advised to tackle the future today.''
From the other side of the Border, David Young, sales and marketing
director with Scottish Milk (the Scottish Milk Marketing Board's
successor body), claimed there would be little change in the loyalty of
the 1950 producers who signed on with it last year.
Nor did he see a major change in its selling arrangements, mainly
based on individually negotiated long-term contracts. An auction system
had been introduced but he did not expect this for more than the current
one-sixth of the group's output.
However, Dr Tim Morrow, production director of United Dairy Farmers in
Ulster, said its Dutch auction system by computer had worked extremely
smoothly from the outset although some fine tuning might be desirable.

PAUL Gascoigne, the player whose temperament was supposed to crack in
the white-hot heat of an Old Firm clash, provided the answer to his
doubters at Celtic Park last night.
The Ibrox summer signing was reviled by the Celtic support throughout
the game, but, after 75 minutes, he produced a piece of magic which
silenced his persecutors.
After a second half of almost unrelenting Celtic pressure, Rangers
snatched victory when Gascoigne set up the winner for Ally McCoist.
It came in one of the sporadic, but always menacing raids, which
Rangers produced after the break.
This particular one brought a corner on the right and Gascoigne moved
across to take it in front of the Celtic support. He swung the ball into
the penalty box, it was cleared, but only as far as young Charlie
Miller.
He threaded the ball through the Celtic defence and back to the feet
of the English internationalist, who was still lurking out on the right.
Gascoigne controlled the ball, looked up, then curled in a cross of
perfect precision and delicacy towards the far post.
It moved away from Gordon Marshall, left the defence struggling and
there, almost inevitably, was McCoist to send a header beyond the keeper
and into the net.
How the Ibrox fans, those 4700 in a crowd of 32,789 who had tickets,
celebrated in that one corner of the new Parkhead. For a short time that
piece of Paradise belonged to them.
The match had been a magnificent advert for the Scottish game. Here
were two teams who, as their managers had promised, went looking for
victory in the constant knowledge that this game had to be decided on
the night.
It was sudden death, and, ultimately, Celtic were the side who
perished.
In the first half Rangers were always the team who looked more likely
to score -- but they wasted chances. Oleg Salenko, Brian Laudrup, David
Robertson, and Miller, all had opportunities which were wasted.
After half-time Celtic took control, but when they did find a way past
Richard Gough -- and that was not all that often -- they found Andy
Goram in superb form.
In 51 minutes, the Ibrox keeper made a magnificent save from a John
Collins free kick, and six minutes from the end, as Celtic surged
forward trying to save the game, Goram made another fine save from a
Paul McStay volley.
Celtic will look back on that second half and believe that they were
entitled to have more reward from their efforts.
That, possibly, is true, but, with Gough and Goram, few teams will be
able to find a way through this Rangers defence.
Then, Rangers can point to some of their incisive moves in the first
half, particularly when Laudrup and Robertson combined down the left
flank.
The jury will still remain out so far as Gascoigne is concerned. It
requires more than one cross, no matter how perfect, to forge a fresh
reputation.
But the omens surrounding the #4.5m man were much brighter at the end
of the game than they were beforehand when people suggested that he
would not be able to handle the occasion.
Gascoigne did handle it and despite the ill-informed pre-match hype
which suggested that he would be involved in a mano a mano with Celtic's
Peter Grant that did not happen.
For most of the time he was left matching his skills with McStay.
The Celtic captain may have had the best of these individual jousts
with Gascoigne. However, the Englishman went home savouring victory, and
enjoying his own particular contribution.
There always was more than just a semi-final spot at stake last night.
For the fans of both teams, this opening Old Firm encounter was a
barometer for the season ahead.
Whether that is the case or not, it was certainly what the rival
supports believed.
Rangers have won, and have staked out their territory.
Celtic, as challengers, must regroup and think again as they wait for
the first premier division clash against their oldest rivals which comes
at the end of this month.
Last night Rangers had the ability to absorb pressure, and the resolve
to return from prolonged periods under the cosh, to hit back. It was
that attitude, that determination, which helped bring them their winner.
They gave notice that they are not yet ready to give up the domination
of the Scottish game they have enjoyed for so long.
The ball now is with Celtic. They must come back if they are to
convince people that their ambitions and their challenge are genuine.
There were three bookings in a game which was handled well by referee
Jim McCluskey -- and Gascoigne was not one of them.
The yellow cards were shown to Miller, Gough, and Petric -- all
Rangers players.
That gives an indication of how hard-pressed they were on occasions
but also how they have mastered the survival techniques which bring
success in the modern game.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, Hughes, Grant, Donnelly,
McStay, Walker, Thom, Collins. Substitutes -- van Hooydonk, Bonner,
McLaughlin.
RANGERS -- Goram, Wright, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Petric, Miller,
Gascoigne, McCoist, Salenko, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Thomson, Durie,
Cleland.
Referee -- J McCluskey (Stewarton).

MOTHERWELL manager Alex McLeish was one of the staunchest defenders of
his former club, Aberdeen, when the Pittodrie side were going through
the agonies of the relegation struggle last season, but he might be
proved painfully accurate if his own side are dismissed from the
Coca-Cola Cup in a quarter-final at Fir Park tonight.
McLeish, one of the most popular players to have worn the red shirt of
Aberdeen, consistently insisted that his old team were much better than
their form suggested last term and is seeing his assessment bearing
fruit this season.
''The big difference in any team is confidence. Aberdeen have got that
back and have made a good start to the season,'' he said. ''They have a
new manager and Roy Aitken will not hesitate to change things if they
don't impress. They know they are playing for their places.
''At Motherwell, we are aiming to be up there with clubs like Aberdeen
and the Old Firm every season, challenging for prizes.''
McLeish and his team managed that much last year but they had a
disappointing opening to this season when they were knocked out of the
UEFA Cup at the preliminary stage by a Finnish side, MyPah 47, who were
fitter than, but considerably inferior to, the Fir Park lot.
Since then Motherwell have made progress and their 1-1 draw with
Celtic at Parkhead at the weekend was evidence that they are again on
form. ''Reading the papers it is hard to see if we were in that game at
all,'' he said, ''because it seemed to be all about the Celtic
revolution. I thought we contributed quite a bit to a game that was
entertaining. It took us time to get going but we did well then.''
McLeish has a full squad from which to choose, excepting long-term
injured men Mitchel van der Gaag and Miodrag Krivokapic, and there may
not be much change from Saturday's team. ''We believe we can win and
like every other side left, we are aware that the chances of success
later on have to be better with one of the Old Firm out. We have been
playing well and all we need to apply is the killer instinct.''
Aitken acknowledges the respect in which McLeish is held in the north
as well as his closeness to the club but does not believe that it gives
him any extra bonus when the teams meet.
''We know all about each other's teams, anyway,'' he said. ''Both
teams play as a unit and it will be the one that does it better who will
get through to the semi-final. We have had two convincing wins in the
competition and it would be nice to get a third at Motherwell.
''I believe we are finding the consistency that was missing last
season, and we want to get back to being challengers for the prizes.''
He has three players to check over, John Inglis, Scott Booth, and
Stewart McKimmie, but is hopeful all will play.
Partick Thistle, fresh from an encouraging win over Hearts, take on
the most dangerous of all first-division sides in cup competitions,
Airdrie, at Broadwood, and are fully aware of the threat to their
progress. Manager Murdo MacLeod put it this way; ''Airdrie just keep on
winning, whatever cup it is.''
As a consequence, the new man at Firhill will have his players primed
for the task. ''We will have to apply ourselves in the same way Airdrie
will and then try to play football. It would be a great lift for the
club and particularly the fans if we can get through to the
semi-final.''
MacLeod was pleased with the way his players responded at the weekend
after the criticism of them after a poor show the previous week, but
insists that nothing less will be needed tonight. He has no injury
problems but striker Rod McDonald is back in contention after having
missed out recently because of flu.
Airdrie manager Alex MacDonald is not much wiser than any of the rest
of us why his side invariably turn on better performances in cup ties
than in everyday league games. ''Maybe it is the fact that it is a
one-off and played to a result, but I don't really know the answer. It
certainly would be a big boost to get into the semi-finals.''
He has no major personnel problems, but waits to check on Tom McIntyre
who suffered a knock.

MAYBE it was because he was in a good mood after scoring another of
those winning goals that have become his hallmark, but Ally McCoist was
in magnanimous form afterwards, praising everbody and everything about
the first Old Firm confrontation of the season.
The irrepressible striker was thrilled with the cross provided by Paul
Gascoigne for the goal that separated the teams and sent Rangers into
the semi-final of the Coca-Cola Cup, dazzled by the play of goalkeeper
Andy Goram and enamoured at the new Parkhead. He also had time to offer
words of praise for two Celtic midfielders, Paul McStay and Peter Grant,
as well as Gascoigne.
However, perhaps the most relevant observation the Scotland striker
made was in reference to Gascoigne who, in his view, had come through a
tough ordeal well. ''It is difficult for anyone to imagine the pressure
he was under, with people talking about betting on him being sent off
and that kind of nonsense. All he wants to do is to express himself on
the park and we should all be encouraging him to do that.
''He came through it really well and so, too, did McStay and Grant
considering that they were also under pressure.''
McCoist, a veteran of many an Old Firm drama, felt that it was one of
the more open meetings. ''Celtic were comfortable on the ball and they
have two good front men who will score goals against any opposition.
They were up against a goalkeeper, Andy Goram, who must be the best in
Britain. At shot-stopping he is tremendous and he thrives when his
defence is good and the defence thrives when he is good.''
McCoist was also anxious to point out that the tackle by Richard Gough
on Celtic substitute Pierre van Hooydonk in the penalty area soon after
the Dutchman's arrival was ''the best you will see all season''.
He had anticipated a fabulous atmosphere at the new Parkhead and was
not disappointed. ''It was magic. I thought it might suffer because of
the two empty ends, but the noise was so loud that didn't affect it. Our
little band of fans managed to make themselves heard all through.''
His manager, Walter Smith, naturally, was pleased that McCoist had
made his mark yet again. People are inclined to write off Ally, but he
has never been the type who depended on great physical prowess. If he
can stay injury-free I have no doubt he will play for another two or
three years.'' He paused and thought of what that might mean and added:
''Well, maybe not three.''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns, while disappointed at the result, took
some positive encouragement from the tie. ''Overall, I was pleased with
our play and the way we passed the ball, even after going a goal down.
We are trying to get the players to play a certain way and that takes
time. I thought McStay was the best man on the park which, considering
he has played only two games in four months, is remarkable. Simon
Donnelly did well and so did Brian McLaughlin when he came on. We are
still two or three players short of the squad we need.''
The Celtic manager was generous in his praise of Goram who, in his
words, had ''two remarkable saves''. Everybody, it seemed, was being
nice about everybody else. Was this really an Old Firm game?

SCOTLAND have moved above England in the latest world rankings list
issued by FIFA yesterday. The progress of Craig Brown's side in the
European Championship qualifying groups is reflected by the sport's
world governing body rating the Scots at twenty-fourth -- a rise of
eight places on their 1994 position.
But the faltering position of England, who host the 1996 finals,
reflects their lack of competitive international fixtures and they are
now ranked only twenty-sixth, having slipped from eighteenth last year.
This leaves Terry Venables' experimental side below the likes of
Egypt, Zambia, and Ghana. Leading positions (1994 positions in
brackets):
1, Brazil (1) 68.42 points; 2, Spain (2) 59.69; 3, Germany (5) 59.28;
4, Norway (8) 58.86; 5, Italy (4) 58.10; 6, Argentina (10) 57.80; 7,
Denmark (14) 57.51; 8, Russia (13) 56.75; 9, Mexico (15) 54.93; 10,
Switzerland (7) 54.41; 11, Bulgaria (16) 54.40; 12, Portugal (20) 54.17;

Czech Republic (34) 49.32; 20, Republic of Ireland (9) 49.26.
Others: 24, Scotland (32) 47.56; 26, England (18) 47.04; 56, Northern
Ireland (45) 35.15; 61, Wales (41) 33.78.

HEARTS must tread carefully tonight when they face up to Dundee in a
quarter-final of the Coca-Cola Cup at Dens Park, especially after the
Edinburgh side's recent defeat at Firhill.
Yesterday, Tynecastle manager Jim Jefferies worried over an injury to
young Alan Johnston, a player who has impressed since being given his
head by the new man in charge at Gorgie Road.
And Jefferies remains worried over the dip in form which brought that
unexpected defeat from Partick Thistle in the premier division.
He also should have concerns about the team he must face tonight,
Dundee, who saw off another premier division side, Kilmarnock, in the
last round of this sudden-death tournament.
Jefferies' counterpart on Tayside, Dundee manager Jim Duffy, will be
without striker Gerry Britton and defender Roddy Manley, but hopes to
have two of his foreign players fit for the clash. Dane Morton Wieghorst
and Czech Dusan Vrto will undergo fitness tests this morning, and they
could be playing against the Edinburgh side.
''This is the kind of game we need right now,'' said Duffy. ''We did
not play as well as I had hoped at the weekend. But, going in against a
premier side will give us the lift we need.
''This is the type of game which gets the adrenalin going. I am sure
that we will rise to this occasion. There is a semi-final spot waiting
for us if we win, and the atmosphere will be right and we have to make
sure that our performance matches the expectations of our fans.
''We did really well against Kilmarnock in the last round, and that is
the level of form we have to aim for again. The players know that.''
Duffy, as always, ignores the fresh speculation which has grown around
the club. Remarkably, the man gets on with his job without fuss and even
when you suggest that a semi-final spot will boost revenue for the Dens
Park club, he responds by saying: ''That is not my main concern.
''My job is to get the team playing well and a semi-final would give
us all a boost which would help with our promotion aims. That is all
that matters to me.''
It is an admirable single mindedness and one which will threaten
Hearts tonight.
Jefferies admits: ''We have to do better than we did at the weekend.
That was a disappointment and now we may have to do without Alan
Johnston, which would be a problem for us.
''However, Willie Jamieson is ready to play again and we have to go
into the game positively. We know what Dundee can do -- the Kilmarnock
result underlined that. The players have to be prepared for this one.''

DUNDEE United may be hauled before the Scottish League for admitting
they wanted to sign striker Duncan Shearer. The Pittodrie club are
furious at what they see is a clear breach of rules and an attempt to
tap the player.
Manager Roy Aitken said: ''Billy Kirkwood is totally out of order in
making such a statement. It is ludicrous to suggest we would sell
Shearer. As far as I am concerned he is an integral part of my plans. He
is far too important to us to let go. I'm sure 90% of the clubs in this
country would want him. But I'm the lucky manager who has got him.
Shearer has two years left of his contract and I can assure our fans
that he will fulfil it.''
Rule 53 forbids clubs to express interest in registered players
belonging to other clubs as this is regarded as inducements.
Rangers were fined #5000 two years ago for tapping Duncan Ferguson in
his move to Ibrox.
Aberdeen will make no official complaint, but a Scottish League
official said Kirkwood's comments would be studied and action could
follow.
* THE Football Association yesterday charged West Ham defender Julian
Dicks with bringing the game into disrepute following his clash with
Chelsea's John Spencer that left the Scotland striker with a head wound.
Television pictures showed Dicks appearing to stamp on the head of
Spencer as West Ham crashed to a 3-1 home defeat last Monday. Dicks
escaped punishment from referee Robbie Hart at the time, although
Spencer required eight stitches in a gash above his ear.
Spencer played on with his head bandaged and scored twice.
Dicks claimed that the incident had been an accident and the Chelsea
man shrugged the clash aside as ''one of those things''.
But the Darlington official has now viewed a video of the clash -- the
latest controversy of Dicks' ill-starred career -- and it is understood
that he has advised action should be taken against the player.
* TONY Higgins, the Scottish Players' Union secretary, last night
welcomed Diego Maradona's move to set up a world footballers' union. The
disgraced Argentinian star announced the creation of the International
Association of Professional Footballers.
Maradona was joined at a news conference in Paris with stars including
Eric Cantona, Tomas Brolin, and Gianluca Vialli. Higgins applauded the
move, but warned the group that they must first liaise with the European
colleagues.
* QUEEN'S Park striker Ross Caven will miss the chance tonight to
spoil the 100% record of Livingston because he is in Russia. Caven is a
business consultant and travelled out on Monday for important meetings.

PAISLEY'S Mike Deveney defends the British featherweight championship
tonight against Doncaster's Jon Jo Irwin at Potters Bar.
The Englishman, who holds the World Boxing Organisation
Inter-Continental and All-Ireland featherweight titles, sees this as a
springboard to big money fights, but the 29-year-old Scot has enjoyed
the experience of meeting better fighters in his career.
The promise Irwin first displayed on his way to a Commonwealth Games
gold medal in 1990 has been proved, despite the fact that he cuts
easily. It is Irwin who packs the bigger punch and, capable of
withstanding Deveney's battering style, he enters the ring as favourite.

EUROPEAN soccer faces a potential upheaval today when the European
Court of Justice receives a preliminary opinion on whether the sport's
lucrative transfer system violates European Union law.
An advocate-general of the Luxembourg-based court, German Carl Otto
Lenz, is due to give his opinion on a landmark case brought by Belgian
player Jean-Marc Bosman.
Although the court is not bound to follow the opinion, in practice it
usually does.
Bosman argues that the transfer system and restrictions affecting
players moving across Europe are illegal and that professional
footballers are entitled to the same freedom of movement as other EU
workers.
A final judgement on the case, which has sent shockwaves through
professional soccer, is not expected before late November at the
earliest.

Scotland U17 1, Belgium U17 2
TWO-goal Jurgen Cavens was Belgium's match-winner in their opening tie
of the Four Nations tournament at Stirling.
Scotland's defence was continually stretched by the pacy Belgian
attack in which Anderlecht's Walter Baseggio was outstanding.
The Scots were shocked in seven minutes when Cavens sent a low shot
into the net for the opener. The home side then had to thank keeper
Barry Cook, of Rangers. Three times in quick succession he got down
quickly to the feet of Cavens, Poorters, and Janssens to clear.
Cook had no answer in 56 minutes when yet another through ball found
Cavens and his pace took him away from Steve Fallon before shooting low
into the net.
Scotland gave their supporters hope in 64 minutes when Hearts striker
Derek Holmes, who had replaced Mark Innes minutes before, swept the ball
home from close range.
SCOTLAND -- Cook (Rangers), Fallon (Dundee United), Borland (Celtic),
McCaffrey (Hibernian), Watt (Rangers), Innes (Oldham), McBride (Celtic),
Easton (Dundee United), Clark (Oldham), Young (Rangers), Queen (Hearts).
Substitutes -- Mitchell (St Mirren), Holmes (Hearts), MacLeod (Bolton),
Martin (Hibernian), Young (Aberdeen).
BELGIUM -- Gillet, Lehance, Hoefkens, Coomans, Teelen, Vergeylen,
Lopes-Rodrigues, Poorters, Janssens, Baseggio, Cavens. Substitutes --
Lebegge, Vlaminck, Dewaele, Vandessel, Vanhandenhove.
Referee -- J Rowbotham (Kirkcaldy).
* HOLLAND opened with a 2-1 win over Denmark. The Dutch struck at the
start of the second half when Raphael Supusepa, of Ajax, scored with a
12-yard drive and then Elery Cairo, of Feyenoord, added a second with a
20-yard drive just inside the far post.
Denmark pulled one back throughStefan Hansen, of Viking.

JOHN Higgins can go all the way and win the Regal Masters title in
Motherwell Civic Centre, according to his friend and rival, Alan
McManus, whom he beat 5-1 in a first-round match last night.
McManus could consider that he did very little wrong but Higgins, who
will meet Ronnie O'Sullivan in tomorrow night's quarter-finals, was very
solid whenever an opportunity arose.
However, the world No.6 at least was pleased to be back in action
after the summer recess. He also is looking forward to regular practice
sessions with Higgins, a project which was postponed until last night's
head-to-head was out of the way.
Higgins agreed that his own safety game had improved but, as usual,
was reluctant to pick out the strong points of his play. But with five
runs of more than 40, his break-building also was impressive last night.
He won a long opening frame which was marked by good safety play from
both players. When McManus missed a red into a middle pocket, Higgins
stepped in for a break of 73 to go two up before the crowd were treated
to some added excitement in the third frame when he threatened to
compile a maximum 147.
Making good use of plants, he worked his way to 89 before he missed
the twelfth black.
In the fourth, Higgins compiled a break of 42 which, perhaps, should
have been more and his opponent was able to leave him needing a snooker
when McManus potted the yellow even although he had to suffer some
anxious moments after he carelessly missed the green with all the
colours on their spots.
A run of 55 helped the Wishaw-born Higgins towards the winning post as
he claimed the first frame after the interval for a 4-1 lead and he was
first to strike again in the sixth frame. When another opportunity arose
minutes later he finished off in style with a clearance of 98.
Earlier in the day Darren Morgan booked a quarter-final against Steve
Davis by whitewashing John Parrott 5-0.
The Welshman promised to be ''a new happy Morgan'' this season as he
continues to seek his first major title and thus begin to command the
media attention which he feels he deserves.

BLACKBURN Rovers manager Ray Harford has reacted to the speculation by
firmly denying any dissension in the ranks at Ewood Park.
Harford and his team have been criticised after the dreadful start to
the defence of the Premiership title and their Champions' League defeat
at the hands of Spartak Moscow last week.
Rovers have lost five and drawn one of the six matches since beating
QPR on the opening day of the season, and Saturday's 3-0 defeat by
Liverpool led to ''crisis'' headlines.
The situation has not been helped by speculation over Kenny Dalglish's
future and reports of a rift between him and Harford.
But Harford, aware that the hole will be dug deeper if Rovers are
beaten by Swindon tonight, made it clear that while the club as a whole
had to respond, he was first in the firing line.
''I'm the man who picks the team and I know I stand or fall by the
results,'' said Harford. ''If there are any cans to be carried I'll
carry them. That's the fact of the matter and I accept it.
''Morale takes a beating when you're going through a difficult time,
but we have to have broad backs and accept the criticisms.
''Everyone knows that it's a game about opinions and I can't stop
people having their say, but whatever else is being said our only
problem centres around results out on the pitch.
''It's no good panicking, although that isn't to say that we aren't
aware that something needs to be done.''
Millionaire owner Jack Walker dismissed speculation about Dalglish,
saying: ''There is no question of Kenny leaving Blackburn.'' But Harford
did not attempt to hide his displeasure at claims of a rift with the man
he replaced in the Rovers hotseat three months ago.
''As far as Kenny Dalglish and I are concerned we are good friends who
work well together,'' declared Harford. ''We have achieved a lot and as
such have become high profile as a club -- perhaps even more high
profile than I realised. We seemed to have become everyone's idea of a
story and I can't alter that.''
He added: ''I have stepped up from being a coach to a manager at other
clubs and there is always a settling in and sorting out period.
''I am self-critical and when things aren't going right I always look
at every aspect of the job, including myself.''

DAVID Gilmour will play in the West of Scotland Open next month, less
than a year after having refused surgery to remove a disc.
The 24-year-old has been dogged by spinal problems. His back injury
first stopped him in his tracks after having represented Scotland as a
19-year-old at the European championships in 1990, and re-occurred in
the first match at last year's Commonwealth Games.
''My back feels fine now,'' said Gilmour, who has only managed to play
one full season out of the last five. ''In June, I was scheduled to have
a disc removed and at the last minute decided against it. It was the
best decision I have made.''
Gilmour will concentrate on doubles this year in a bid to ease himself
back into top-class competition, and will line up with partner Gordon
Haldane at the West of Scotland Open at the Cockburn Centre, Glasgow,
from October 7-8.
''I have no plans to play singles,'' he said. ''At the moment it's
just one step at a time.''

DIVISION two side, David Lloyd Centre, have shown their commitment to
the Scottish national league with a host of new signings headed by
Scottish No.2 Martin Heath.
Others joining the club's squash professional, Derek Ritchie, and
Malcolm Watt are Heath's older brother, David, and former Scottish
Junior champion Blair Christie, who have parted company with division
one sides Glasgow Accies and Bridge of Allan respectively.
Failure to win promotion during the team's debut season prompted the
signings.
The league gets under way next month, and the new-look David Lloyd
side will open on October 10 against Heriot-Watt University, the team
likely to be their major promotion rivals.

''WE will repel them, we will repel them,'' said Taylor Woodrow
chairman Colin Parsons yesterday about the #500m claim launched by
Eurotunnel against the TML construction group in which it is a 10%
participant.
He added that it smacked to him of desperation born out of panic
management in a financial crisis and that it was a ridiculous way to
finish a major infra-structure like this.
For good measure, he said, it was a Bosnian solution to a British
problem.
Taylor Woodrow had hoped to release #5m out of the #20m of
provisioning it had set aside against the Channel Tunnel but was
completely thrown when last Thursday Eurotunnel said it was launching
the claim.
That release would have been very valuable in the interim results.
These show pre-tax profits down 36% to #14m with almost all the damage
occurring in the UK construction and contracting activities.
Altogether these lost #13.8m on trading offset by #1.3m profit on the
sale of the remaining stake in Eurotunnel units -- they brought in #6.4m
in the comparable period.
The trading losses comprise #8.3m of reorganisation costs, which has
led to 300 UK redundancies, and #3.5m from actual operations compared
with #4.6m in 1994.
Mr Parsons said that the UK construction losses cannot be recovered
this year and that while the red ink will not be of the same magnitude
next year any profit would be very modest.
Margins are virtually non-existent and the postion is not going to
change for a number of years.
Fortunately overseas contracting has been somewhat happier and the
current half-year and 1996 should benefit from the total of #300m of
work directly attributable to the company for the Kuala Lumpur Light
Transit Railway in Malaysia. The overall construction order book dropped
11% to #644m although there has since been an improvement overseas.
Housing worldwide saw a 6% fall in unit sales to 1343 due in
particular to Australia but profits were overall marginally better at
#9.1m with the UK contribution steady at #3m. North Anmerica was mixed
with the 54% owned Monarch Corporation in Canada, Mr Parsons' particular
joy, California and Florida ahead but offset by loss-making Nevada.
Planning permission is being sought to redevelop the 1250 acres at the
former US air force base at Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire as part of the
strategy of remaining an active participant in housebuilding.
Mr Parsons warned that it is very unlikely that full year profits will
match the #50.9m seen in 1994. The interim dividend has been held at
0.75p.

THE directors of United Auctions (Scotland) are to resist attempts by
Guinness Peat, a London-based financial concern, to acquire a 29.9%
stake in the firm.
Guinness Peat made its unexpected bid last Friday following the
announcement that United Auctions had gained a listing on the
Alternative Investment Market (AIM) through which it is anticipated its
shares can be more freely traded.
The bid is pitched at 275p per Ordinary share and closes on Friday,
September 29. It is estimated United's shares are currently worth 305p.
In a letter posted to all shareholders last night United's chairman,
John Izat, advised them to ignore the offer. ''The board first heard of
this tender offer from the press last Friday evening and other than the
tender offer documentations have still received no communication from
Stirling Hendry &amp; Co (Guinness Peat stockbrokers) or Guinness Peat,'' he
said. ''This leads your board to conclude their intentions are
hostile.''
Mr Izat pointed out that in January of this year the net assets of
United Auctions -- the second-largest auction company in Scotland --
were valued at 618p per share.
''While your board can only speculate as to the intentions of Guinness
Peat if it were to acquire a controlling interest in your company, it is
by no means certain that the exisitng auctioneering and other trading
activities would be maintained,'' he added.
''We assume that Guinness Peat is a subsidiary of Guinness Peat Group
plc, a company which in the past has acquired key shareholdings in
companies and then sought to realise profit, thereby depriving those
from whom the shares were purchased of any uplift in value.''
Mr Izat said the British Linen Bank and other shareholders, which
between them control 30% of the issued Ordinary share capital, had told
the board they would not be accepting the Guinness Peat offer.
United Auctions has seen a major turnround in its fortunes in recent
years. Bank borrowings have been more than halved to less than #3m and a
net trading profit of #837,000 was announced in January. Last year its
marts at 19 centres including major operations in Perth and Stirling
sold more than #120m worth of livestock.
There is growing speculation that a group of farmers is planning to
lodge a defensive counter-bid to protect what they see as the integrity
of UA and its position as an outlet for their livestock.

FALLING interest rates could soon spell a dramatic reduction in income
for investors, an independent financial adviser has warned.
''Mortgage rates have been reduced by nearly all banks and building
societies,'' said Jeffrey Deans of Glasgow's Save &amp; Invest, ''but the
rates paid to investors are also likely to come down.
''The Chancellor appears to have won the interest rate battle with the
Bank of England. He will now be pushing for lower interest rates for
next year, and the first cut could be around Budget time in November,
with further cuts next year.
''The last time interest rates came down, between 1990 and 1993,
investors relying on monthly interest to supplement their pensions saw
decreases which resulted in income cuts of about 65%.''
It is unlikely that these latest cuts will equal those of 1990-1993,
but even a 1% cut in rates can result in a significant cut in income.
On a #25,000 investment with interest paid monthly, the basic rate
taxpayer could at best expect a net return of around 4.75%, giving a
monthly income of #98.96. A 1% cut would result in this income dropping
to #78.13.
It is possible to invest without being at the mercy of interest rates
or stockmarket fluctuations. ''At Save &amp; Invest we can arrange a stable
investment which could yield up to #156.75 each month,'' said Deans.
''We would suggest clients who want a secure and stable investment
should consider with-profits bonds from insurance companies. We would
even suggest some element of Stock Market investment for a proportion of
the money, say #5000. With net interest rates low, income levels from
the Stock Market can match building society returns.
''However, there is growth potential. One fund we currently use, SVM
Superior Distribution, has provided over 20% growth, in addition to
income, since October 1993.
''Should no Stock Market element be required, clients can simply stick
with the with-profits bonds.''
With-profits bonds provide a stable return on investment. An annual
bonus rate is set each year, and an extra bonus may be paid when income
is taken or the capital withdrawn.
Bonds are not necessarily linked to any particular time frame, but
usually they are recommended as a minimum of a four or five-year
investment.
''For many people, with-profits bonds have offered an ideal
solution,'' said Deans. ''Especially for investors requiring a good
level of income with some potential growth.''
A comparison between the top rates from a building society and a
with-profits bond shows a difference of almost 60%. The top income from
#25,000 invested in the Halifax Building Society would be #98.96
monthly, compared to #156.75 from a with-profits bond.
With-profits bonds will grow capital should the terminal bonus be paid
-- for example, General Accident has recently announced to its 1990
investors that on top of the 7.5% they are currently receiving as an
annual bonus rate, the terminal bonus rate will be a further 7.5%.
''So many people have money in the building society because they think
it's safer, but these institutions tend to aggressively hang onto money,
whereas we can help our clients actually increase their income.''
Bonds vary according to the company offering them. Prudential
currently has an annual bonus rate of 6.5% net with a terminal bonus of
a further 1.75% net. Eagle Star offers between 6.75% and and 7.25%
depending on the amount invested.
Deans advises his customers not to put all their eggs in one basket.
''We usually suggest that someone with #25,000 to invest should leave
#5000 in a bank or building society and place the rest in a with-profits
bond,'' he said.
This is because most companies offering with-profits bonds have a
charge if capital is taken out in the first four years.
All the above companies, with the exception of Eagle Star, have
charges if capital is withdrawn within the first four or five years.
Taking out a with-profits bond need not cost thousands of pounds. Even
smaller amounts can yield a higher gain from a bond than from a building
society or bank account.
For example, with Clerical Medical, a #5000 investment arranged
through Save &amp; Invest can be considerably enhanced. Part of the
commission which Save &amp; Invest receives will be added to the bond, and
as Clerical Medical has no initial set-up fee, the total yield in the
first year can be 11.5% net, including the current terminal bonus.
The charges are paid through a 0.85% per annum fee -- which ceases on
long-term investments.
The income facility on the bond allows a maximum payment of 7% of your
investment per year. This can be paid monthly, even on a small
investment of #5000, directly into your bank or building society
account.
Choosing which investment to go for need not be difficult. Save &amp;
Invest will take you through the entire process and has no obligation to
anybody but the client.
''Save &amp; Invest receives commission from whichever insurance company
we arrange the bond with,'' said Deans.
''By rebating part of the commission, Save &amp; Invest can actually save
people money they would have spent dealing directly with the
institutions.
''This area of investment is very popular and Save &amp; Invest has placed
more than #40m into with-profits bonds over the last few years.''

FARMERS can rely on Moredun Animal Health -- a commercial spin-off
from the Moredun Foundation -- to plug any gap would arise if an
essential vaccine fell out of commercial production, Jim Stobo,
foundation chairman said yesterday.
Speaking at the official opening of the new MAH premises on the
Pentlands Science Park, near Penicuik, Midlothian, Mr Stobo said:''There
have been occasions in the past when certain products have become
questionable in terms of profitable commercial production, despite
continuing to be of crucial importance to selected sectors of the
farming industry.
''In the future, when a product is deemed essential on health and
welfare grounds, the antigen facility we have here will be available as
a 'safety valve' for the industry.''
Yesterday's opening ceremony, performed by the Earl of Lindsay,
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, marked the completion of the
#11.5m first phase of the science park development.
The commercial company was formed in 1988 with a staff of two. It now
employs 33 people and has an annual turnover over #1.5m.
The #11m first phase of the science park, partly funded by the sale of
the foundation's 31-acre site at Gilmerton in Edinburgh, includes new
headquarters for the foundation. Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd
have been major backers of the project which has also attracted support
from the European Regional Development Fund.
The second phase, which is now under way, will provide a centre for
small and medium sized businesses involved in science and research based
industries. The first two tenants have been named. One will be LTS
International, an Edinburgh consultancy, research and project management
company specialising in forestry and forest industries. The second is
Cogent Diagnostics Ltd which manufactures diagnostic tests for the
detection of autoimmune disease inhumans.
The final phase of the science park will involve the construction of
an international research centre to house the Moredun Research Institute
which is still located at Gilmerton in Edinburgh.
Mr Murdo Mackenzie, the foundation's chief executive, recalled how it
was established in 1920 when farmers, concerned at the loss of
livestock, got together and employed two vets who set up an animal
disease research association.

CHAMPION jockey Richard Dunwoody and his main rival for the title,
Adrian Maguire, are in action at Perth this afternoon for a meeting
which has attracted several runners from southern stables.
They each have four rides and are sure to have the support of many
punters. Dunwoody partners two for trainer Gordon Richards, Real Tonic
and General Command, both not without a chance.
He also rides Qualitair Son for Tom Kemp in the first, but this
novices' hurdle is more likely to go to Maguire, who partners Mister
Muddypaws, a winner at Hexham in May.
Maguire will ride Seeking Gold for Fife trainer Jim Barclay, but he
has a much better chance in the novices' chase with Take Two, a winner
on his first run over fences at Bangor.
Nigel Twiston-Davies has an excellent strike rate at the Scone track
with 14 winners from 23 runners since 1990.
He has brought six from his Cheltenham yard and it will be surprising
if he and jockey Carl Llewellyn return empty handed.
They have excellent prospects with Gala's Pride in the mares' hurdle
and Zamirah in the feature race, the #6000 Royal Bank Chase.
Martin Pipe pays his first visit to Perth, sending two runners from
his Somerset yard, Runaway Pete, a winner at Exeter on Wednesday, in the
Bruce Wilson Hurdle, and newcomer Tipping The Line, in the ''bumper.''
Would they come so far if he didn't think they would win?.
Peter Hobbs rode four winners, two of them for local trainer Tom Dyer,
at the last Perth meeting, and he has three rides for Dyer today. Middle
Bay and Gymcrack Gamble were pulled up last time, and Marco Magnifico,
who ran at Ayr last week, is yet to show some form over hurdles.
Lucinda Russell, who took out a licence to train in Fife, has her
first runner with Fiveleigh Builds in the handicap chase. The
eight-year-old won a novices' chase at Plumpton in April when trained by
Charlie Brooks.
Susan Bradburne, who landed a double at the last meeting, hopes Ayia
Napa, a 33-1 shock, can repeat his success by taking the Sotheby's
Chase, but the opposition is much stiffer this time.
Linda Perratt, who had her first jumps' winner in 22 months with
Runrig at Sedgefield, runs the mare in the novice hurdle, with Peter
Niven on board again.

Fashion director, John Davidson, explains why designers and clothes
fanatics are destined to slide into the red this winter

Carte (Inquiries: 0171 622 2318) and Aveda Haircare (at Cheynes

THIS is a red alert. You are now embarking on a voyage of discovery,
journeying to far-flung corners of the creative imagination, seeking out
strange new ways with fabric.
This is a form of time travel. And already we are docking in a new era
of elegance, where fabrics are wonderfully luxurious and where tailoring
is executed with the strictest precision. Nothing so very strange. Or
unfamiliar. Nothing, that is, except the one and only colour detected is
red.
Actually, we have landed in the here and now of British fashion. The
solvency of British designers has long been a vexed question. Dazzling
stars still fall to Earth (and into the arms of insolvency) with
alarming regularity. But this demonstration in red is rather more than a
dye-pot metaphor for the vicissitudes of the British fashion industry.
For red is the hot colour of the moment all over the fashion map. From
A-for-Armani to Z-for-Zoran, designers everywhere are seeing no colour
bar red.
Any assemblage of total-red makes for a dazzling fashion statement.
Red, however, coaxed into a lifeform (or jacket-form) by an accomplished
designer becomes the ultimate showcase for fine fabric and impeccable
finish. Its vibrancy emphasises that design distinction which separates
the work of creative individuals from mass market monoliths.
And, at a time when high fashion ideals focus on a fuss-free
cleanliness of line and sharpness of silhouette, red draws the eye in an
insistant sort of way towards the absolute luxury of particularly
splendid fabrics and the fashion fizz provided by every less
conventional choice.
Contrast the all-out glamour offensive of Tomasz Starzewski's scarlet
cashmere coat, extravagantly trimmed in fur -- and Roland Klein's sexy
tailoring in gloss-finish PVC, contoured to hug every curve of the body.
A token gesture is no longer quite enough. According to the
authorities on Planet Fashion, red must now be worn in an
uncompromising, all-or-nothing sort of way. Gloves, belts, shoes . . .
every little detail is now coloured red.
Every little detail, that is, apart from hosiery. Please, on no
account believe that the civilised world is quite ready for another
outbreak of scarlet 15-denier tights. Nude is the leg look to choose.
On a grey winter's day in Scotland, total red would be an act of
stylistic defiance against the elements. Camouflage, it is not. ''Hey'',
it screams, ''look at me'' -- and it is therefore best avoided by
wallflowers and shrinking violets. But those with perfect poise or a
strident personality will find it very easy to slip into the red this
season.
Many of us dedicated consumers of fashion are never really out of it.

David Morton explains how management buy-outs will play a part in the
new unitary authorities
THE economic policy of the Thatcher Government sought to release new
forces of private business initiative into society. Liberal lending by
the banks made money available for new enterprise; market forces -- and
privatisation -- provided the opportunities. Success or failure depended
ultimately upon individual business acumen.
The mechanism of the management buy-out was the birth-child of this
environment, with businesses being acquired by their existing managers
in a flurry of activity during the 1980s. This route offered the
greatest personal incentive to managers, but held the greatest corporate
risk.
Privatisation, in many cases through the management buy-out, has on
the one hand benefited resourceful new owners, while on the other hand
spirited but managerially inept MBO teams have launched their companies
only to find that experience gained in a market assured by state
monopoly was inadequate to cope with unfettered competition.
As the heady excesses of the 1980s give way to the more tempered
realism of the 1990s a new area of commerce to fall under the MBO
spotlight could arise from local government reorganisation in Scotland,
where the use of externally contracted services is already
well-established.
The local authority structure in Scotland is in a transitional phase.
The structure which has been in place since 1975 comprising nine
regional councils, 53 district councils and three islands councils is
being replaced by 32 unitary authorities. The local authority elections
in April this year were for members of the new unitary councils which
will run in parallel with the existing structure.
When the transitional phase of reorganisation ends in April next year
the 32 unitary authorities will assume control. They have been designed
to increase the consumer's (taxpayer's) choice of services; to give that
consumer a more influential role in determining how these services
should be delivered; to consider alternative methods of effecting that
delivery; and to work in partnership with both public and private-sector
interests in the provision of the services.
The Government's view is that there should be a shift in emphasis:
local authorities should be seen as ''enablers'' rather than
''providers''; instead of having huge and enormously expensive in-house
resources for service provision, they will co-ordinate and fund this
provision by others.
Of the new authorities, the smaller ones will not enjoy the economies
of scale needed to carry on all those services provided by the old,
larger regional councils.
For instance, a number of agencies were set up by Strathclyde Regional
Council to handle certain services. The region's education department
established one to be responsible for continuing professional education
for teachers -- who attend agency courses and whose schools are charged
a fee for the facility. It is unlikely that all of the new unitary
authorities will be able to afford the expense of creating such
agencies, although the requirement for the service will remain.
Against this background and in view of the Government's support for
decentralisation, deregulation and the enterprise economy, there appear
to be opportunities for ''cutting loose'' these agencies (and other
suppliers to local authorities) into the commercial world through the
MBO process.
Fledgling commercial entities would offer services on a contractual
basis and be free to spread their wings in other spheres of opportunity
for their specialisation.
An MBO would most likely occur at the time of transfer of assets from
regions to unitary authorities. As with MBOs in the commercial world, a
company would be incorporated on behalf of the existing management team.
Members of the team (perhaps with external participants skilled in
management disciplines) would be shareholders and directors. Their
company would purchase from the region those assets which would enable
them to tender for service contracts with the new councils. In addition
to the money invested by the management team, the company's working
capital would be funded by bank borrowing and, possibly, equity
investors.
This route appears to be the logical extension of the trend for local
government to outsource services to commercial providers. Following an
MBO, the providers, now commercially-based, would then possess the
advantage of skills and understanding peculiar to serving local
authorities. An awareness that they, too, are now subject to market
competition must also be to the advantage of their customers, the
unitary authorities and the taxpayers.
However, while MBOs have the benefit of increased commerciality and,
in time, competitiveness, the new authorities may not choose to
entertain them. There are alternatives which may be more compatible with
local government structures rather than the, apparently, more radical
and risky pursuit of the MBO.
A number of unitary authorities may pool resources in jointly setting
up an agency to serve all, or one large authority may retain control of
an agency but agree to its use by other councils on a cost-sharing
basis.
The political outlook and general culture of the unitary authorities
may favour these alternatives -- avoiding accusations of ''giving away
the family silver'' through the sale of assets to a management buy-out
team. Yet, in rejecting the MBO as a matter of principle, they may be
castigated for failing to grasp the commercial nettle, and risking the
opportunity of obtaining competitive public services, with attendant
savings for the taxpayer.

Buenos Aires
ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem today hailed a draft agreement with
Britain on oil exploration around the Falklands as the biggest leap
forward in the sovereignty dispute in more than 160 years.
''It is the first real, legal step foward in Argentina's permanent
struggle to regain sovereignty,'' Menem said in a radio interview. ''It
is the best achievement in 163 years, since our islands were usurped in
1833.''
Foreign Minister Guido di Tella said it was the most important step
since ties were re-established with Britain six years ago.
Di Tella, who had warned that the chances of striking an agreement
looked remote, said the co-operation would include a series of studies,
such as the environmental impact of oil drilling around the islands.
Argentina lays claim to the islands which it invaded in 1982,
precipitating the Falklands war.
However it restored diplomatic relations with Britain when Menem came
to power in 1989 and has forged closer business links while putting the
sovereignty issue under a separate umbrella.
Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said the accord, 3[1/2]
years in the making, could be signed on September 27 in New York by Di
Tella and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, pending approval by the
Cabinet in London.
''Yesterday Prime Minister John Major gave it the green light, now
it's going to be considered by the British Cabinet and only then will we
have official confirmation from the British that the text we are talking
about is fine for the English, and then we can make it public,'' said
Petrella.
The British Embassy and Argentine Foreign Ministry were unable to
confirm details of the draft agreement reported by the Argentine
newspaper Clarin.
However in London a Foreign Office spokesman said a ''tentative
agreement'' had been reached and confirmed that the foreign ministers
would sign the accord at the UN.
Clarin reported that Britain would earn 66% of royalties from any oil
and gas discovered in waters east of the Falklands and Argentina the
rest. In waters west of the islands, towards Argentina, it would be
50-50.
Exploration licences for eastern Falklands waters would be issued by
the British, while the tender for western waters would be handled by a
bi-national commission.
Royalties would be levied at 12% of the value of oil and gas
extracted, with negotiators estimating production could start in four to
six years.
The islanders, eager to start earning from energy reserves some
experts say could rival the North Sea, threatened to go it alone and
start seeking offers in October if no deal was reached.
Falkland Islands Chief Executive Andrew Gurr said the accord created a
better climate for an eventual oil licensing round.
''We look forward to companies coming down here and bidding for the
licences and using bases on the mainland,'' he said. ''With this
agreement, Argentina is implicitly withdrawing threats.''
Although the magnitude of oil reserves in the South Atlantic has not
yet been confirmed, some experts claim there could be as much as in the
North Sea.
British Gas and Argentine oil giant YPF have said they would be
willing to participate in a joint venture if the political deadlock is
broken.
However under a Bill being drawn up by President Menem's brother,
Senator Eduardo Menem, firms must have Argentine permission to
participate in the tender or they will be banned from doing business in
Argentina.--Reuter/AP.

* OUR advice to readers last Christmas was for moderate attacks on the
sherry bottle, in line with the maxim of contentment before capacity. It
seems it wasn't universally followed.
A witness was telling a jury at Edinburgh Sheriff Court about a Boxing
Day party where he reckoned his share of the seasonal drink was
''possibly in the region of a bottle-and-a-half to two bottles of
vodka''.
Prompted about the presence of other drink at the party, which ended
in an alleged stabbing, the witness added: ''Six cans of export, and six
bottles of Becks.'' Up stood solicitor Nigel Beaumont with
characteristic understatement: ''Do you accept that your recollection of
what happened in that house might have been affected?''
Flip answer
* IT could have been a scene from Taggart: a pile of bones discovered
on a Scottish beach. Police cordon it off and fearful onlookers wait
expectantly. Along comes a pathologist to examine the find but within a
couple of minutes she packs up her gear and heads off. ''What
arrangements for a post mortem?'' asks the polis. ''Don't do dolphins,''
she replied.
Close contact
* WISH I'd said that differently department: a prostitute was giving
evidence at the High Court in Edinburgh. ''Does your work involve close
contact with men?'' asked Mr Neil Murray QC. We don't know if he got a
tart reply. In another case an advocate-depute questioned a witness
about his holiday with his wife and daughter. ''Did your wife duly
return from the holiday?'' asked the A-D somewhat pompously. ''No her
name's not Julie, it's Annie,'' came the response.
Post haste ye back
* A NATION again department: a letter to our own Lord Bruce McKain c/o
Parliament House but without the Edinburgh did the rounds of Whitehall,
before the Post Office finally delivered it. SNP cynics might see this
as an omen for budgetary and other correspondence relating to a devolved
parliament.
Lords select
* EARLIER this year, we recounted how advocate Robert Anthony appeared
before Lords Weir and Cameron in the Court of Criminal Appeal, basing
his argument on two previous cases which their lordships had got wrong.
Just to show that the quality of mercy was not strained the judges have
now upheld Mr Anthony's argument, decided that his client suffered a
miscarriage of justice and quashed his conviction.
Name game
* YOU get the impression that someone with the name of Ivor Klayman,
who appeared in the list of cases in the Court of Session, was somehow
destined to become a pursuer in a court action. A clear case of a boy
named sue.
Joining the fray
* THEY keep saying that with a membership of about 370 and rising the
Scottish Bar has become far too big for its own good and that there
isn't enough work to go round. Obviously, the message hasn't yet got
through to the Young Turks, since another 16 have joined the faculty.
One can only hope their self-confidence isn't misplaced.
Fowl play
* LIZ MacKENZIE, who works in the Justiciary Office at Parliament
House, wondered why she was getting strange looks as she drove through
Corstorphine. She felt that something had struck her car near the
Newbridge roundabout, but drove on. She arrived at work to find a hen
pheasant clinging on to the front of her car for dear life. The
miraculous fowl is now in the tender hands of the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds. All being well it will become the first grilled
pheasant ever to make a complete recovery.

Kennedy Wilson explores the reasons why so many Westminster
politicians emerge from the ranks of the legal profession
TONY BLAIR (and wife Cherie), the late Labour leader John Smith,
Malcolm Rifkind, Bill Clinton (and wife Hilary), Roseanna Cunningham,
Paul Boateng, the lamented Sir Nicholas Fairbairn and, of course,
Baroness Margaret. Why do so many politicians forsake the law for a life
in the House of Commons? Is it a skill with adversarial oratory or a
need for power that persuades them to swop courtroom for debating
chamber?
Lawyers have long been in the background, like James Carville
(Clinton's high-profile 1992 campaign consultant) and his wife Mary
Matalin (the then deputy-manager of the rival Bush campaign). The late
Lord ''Fixit'' Goodman used his skills with reasoning and analysis to
influence leaders in both Labour and Conservative parties. Around 80
solicitors/advocates/barristers represent the largest professional
grouping in the Commons. But is this healthy?
On the surface it's easy to see why lawyers turn to politics.
Parliament exists to decide upon laws and lawyers carry out those laws.
Practising and making law are two ends of the same process, although the
late John Smith once said: ''Never address the Commons as if it's a
court; never address a court as if it's the Commons.''
While lawyers interpret the law, MPs make the laws. But not all
lawyers are natural politicians, lacking the tact and ''common touch''.
Besides, a traffic warden may have daily dealings with the motor car
but need not necessarily know how the internal combustion engine works.
Someone may be excellent at enforcing the letter of the law although not
at crafting or amending legislation. Of course, there is more to
politics than law -- social and economic factors for example. And while
the financial rewards for a successful lawyer may far outweigh those for
a good MP the prestige and allure of political power has its advantages.
''If you've spent your life looking round statutes, then you're not
put off when you're presented with a Bill in the House of Commons,''
says Menzies Campbell, QC and MP. ''But, on the other hand, I don't
think that's why people do it. People don't say 'I'll be good at this
because I'm a lawyer'.''
He suggests a common link may be an ability to get ''to the point of
particular issues and seeing how they might be resolved''.
Campbell says that he's often thought ''there are too many lawyers in
government. One of my crusades is to try to get statutes written in
language people understand. Ignorance of the law may be no excuse but
what comes out of Parliament has become so abstruse, so badly drafted
and our law has become over-complicated.
''If you've got too many legal minds either promoting the legislation
or reviewing it then they are inclined to think of every conceivable
possibility and provide for absolutely every intellectually possible set
of circumstances, though not necessarily every practical set of
circumstances.''
Some observers might argue that lawyers, with good educations and fat
salaries, might be the people least able to represent the common man.
''That's up to the common man to decide. It's a matter for party
selection committees and then for voters in an election,'' says Neil
MacCormick, regius professor of public law at the University of
Edinburgh.
Menzies Campbell agrees: ''At a recent surgery I reckon that nearly 20
or 25 people who came to see me had legal problems. And that's not the
first time. I've had the senior partner of a firm of solicitors in my
constituency in my office seeking my advice. So a great deal of what I
am asked to assist the public with has legal implications. If I wasn't
legally qualified or hadn't some understanding of the law I think I
would be less able to deal with quite a lot of things that reach my
desk.''
The preponderance of lawyers in politics has not meant that the
Government as been beholden to this vested interest. On the contrary, in
the 1980s the Conservatives introduced legislation reforming the legal
system, including proposals to break the monopoly solicitors had on
conveyancing, long seen as the bread and butter of the profession.
The Labour Party currently has a consultation paper, Access to
Justice, which lays down some far-reaching changes it would like to see
made to the legal system. Recently Labour's legal affairs spokesman,
Paul Boateng, referring to the legal system, went on record saying:
''I'm hostile to pomposity. I'm hostile to arrogance. I'm hostile to
anything that puts a barrier between the delivery of a publicly funded
service and the people who pay for it.''
Labour wants to see judges more accountable with a different gender
and age mix. Boateng is also critical of the role of the Lord
Chancellor. ''We need to have a system that is very much at arm's length
from any political figure,'' he said recently. ''I really don't believe
it appropriate for a senior politician to have a hands-on approach to
the selection of the judiciary.''
It's certainly the case that many people who set their sights on
politics as a profession will study law beforehand. The skills of the
legal profession, debating and analysis, are common to law and politics.
''There's a functional correlation between making the law and using
it,'' says Professor MacCormick, who studied law at Oxford and has stood
for election under the SNP banner.
Some lawyers spend their professional careers specialising in one
branch of the law and see the errors and loopholes of the legal system
first-hand. Moreover, for court lawyers, speechmaking, debating and
articulating arguments is part of the cut and thrust of their lives and
these are the very qualities that are essential and valuable in a
politician. Lawyers have more expertise in these areas than any other
professional group. Perhaps only lecturers come close.
''People who aim for law are apt to be articulate people, apt to be
good at representing causes. I think it's as likely that people with an
attraction to politics are as attracted to law and vice versa as that
there's a functional correlation between making the law and using it,''
says Professor MacCormick.
Nicholas Fairbairn, long a ''loose cannon'' in Tory ranks, once
expressed a desire to see the Scottish legal system with its procurators
fiscal installed in England. Sir Nicholas, Solicitor General in Scotland
from 1979 to 1982, was also highly critical of what he saw as ''the
procedural inadequacies of the process in the Scottish criminal courts''
according to Julian Critchley's obituary of him. ''Fairbairn claimed
that his part in the (Paddy) Meehan campaign led to improvements in the
way the Scottish judiciary worked.''
Traditionally, law was a good career for an MP. For one thing, the Bar
is a good place to build up financial independence, formerly a
prerequisite to becoming a politician. If your were an
advocate/barrister you could (and generally still can) pick and choose
what work to take on as and when you wanted to -- this would not be the
case with, say, a doctor or an accountant. ''If you're at the Bar and go
into politics and lose your seat you can open up at the Bar the day
after. So on economic terms, it is easier for lawyers to move in and
out,'' says Menzies Campbell.
More than most professions, a lawyer/MP can juggle two careers. Among
many others, the late John Smith did legal work during Parliament's
summer recess, ''to keep his hand in'' according to his biographer Andy
McSmith, who observes: ''Unlike Neil Kinnock, Smith was well used to
professional dealings with political opponents. His legal qualifications
and the contact they gave him -- rightly or wrongly -- made him less
vulnerable to the destructive ridicule his predecessor had to endure.''

Michael Tumelty explains how a concert hall job opened doors for a new
composer
HAVE you heard the one about the doorman at the Glasgow Royal Concert
Hall who was given a major commission to write a piece of music for the
hall's fifth anniversary gala concert? No? Well, it's true.
If you're a regular visitor to the hall -- whether your taste runs to
Simple Minds or the Royal Scottish National Orchestra -- you will know
Tommy Fowler. He's probably held the door to the auditorium open for
you. He may have seen you to your seat. But on October 5, if you're
attending the anniversary gala concert featuring singers from the
Bolshoi Opera and their boss, conductor Alexander Lazarev with the RSNO,
you won't see Tommy there in his regular capacity.
He has the night off and will be in the audience, waiting to hear the
opening work of the concert, a five-minute anniversary fanfare, launched
by the RSNO brass from high in the lighting gallery of the hall,
composed by Fowler, and commissioned from him by Cameron McNicol,
director of the hall.
It's a long way and several dramatic career changes from a rock band
in Fraserburgh to the stage of the Royal Concert Hall, but, for
47-year-old Fowler, it's like a fairy tale come true: one that has left
him still feeling ''privileged and astounded''.
As a youngster in his native Fraserburgh, Tommy Fowler had neither
inkling nor aspiration as to what lay ahead. Far from it, he reflected.
''I did my five-year apprenticeship in the local engineering factory and
spent my early life as an engineer -- it was the done thing.'' A
self-taught guitarist, his interest in music at that time extended no
further than playing in a local rock band.
The first career change loomed early when he was attracted by an item
in the Fraserburgh Herald, advertising a vacancy in the editorial
department of the paper. (''I didn't even know what that meant at the
time,'' said Fowler.) Anyway, he dropped engineering, got the job as
reporter, served his time, then moved to Aberdeen Journals, where he ran
the Buchan district office of the Evening Express and Press and Journal.
By 1984 he was back in Fraserburgh, by now editor of the Fraserburgh
Herald.
The rock band had packed up around 1970, but, while nurturing his
successful career in journalism, Fowler began a close association with a
number of amateur dramatic groups and arts societies -- in 1972 he
became musical director of the Fraserburgh Musical Society, mounting
stage shows.
Song writing had begun with the rock band, and he was aware of an
interest in putting groups of songs together, ''building them into
small-scale musicals''. In the early seventies he started to write for
orchestral instruments: ''I was just experimenting; I had no formal
training in orchestration, and no opportunity to hear what I wrote.''
So he took practical steps, by attending evening classes and by
reforming the Fraserburgh Philharmonic Orchestra, which had been defunct
since the war.
By the early eighties, Fowler was taking an Open University course in
music to expand his technical horizons. ''It was becoming increasingly
clear to me that music was where I wanted to be,'' he said. ''Journalism
was falling by the wayside.''
So much so that in 1987 he went freelance to devote more time to
music. Keeping everything on the boil, however, as a freelance in
Fraserburgh, he set up a news, public relations, and desktop publishing
business, while his wife looked after the family and did some
accountancy work.
''By 1990, we'd both had enough,'' said Fowler, an engaging and
gregarious character who laughingly refers to that moment as ''our joint
mid-life crisis''. His wife had always wanted to be a nurse, and he had
decided he wanted to be a full-time composer.
So they uprooted themselves and headed for Glasgow, he to the
university and a four-year honours degree course in music, his wife to
studying for a nursing qualification. (She is now a staff nurse at
Glasgow's Western Infirmary.)
Tommy graduated this summer, completing a successful degree course and
a period of intense enjoyment as a mature student, where his experiences
ranged from feeling like ''a father confessor'' to his younger
colleagues, to his setting up the contemporary music group, Uni-Son.
It was a period, however, of some financial strain: ''The grant
covered the rent, nothing more,'' he said. Enter the part-time job in
customer care at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, where the
front-of-house staff -- which includes artists, painters, a published
author, bank workers, social workers and more -- were joined by a
composer.
A year ago Fowler was on duty, standing at a door, organising patrons,
when hall director, Cameron McNicol, in Fowler's words, sidled up to him
and said: ''I have an idea; I want you to write an orchestral fanfare
for our fifth anniversary,'' and walked away leaving Fowler, gobsmacked,
rooted to the spot, dying to tell somebody, and unable to leave his
post.
A few weeks later, McNicol expanded on his idea by asking Fowler to
incorporate into the piece, by using one of the traditional musical
codes, the letters FIVE. Fowler went four better and also included GRCH.
He completed a pencil draft of the score and gave it to McNicol, who,
along with Paul Hughes, chief executive of the Royal Scottish National
Orchestra, took it to the Russian conductor Alexander Lazarev and asked
him if he'd be prepared to conduct it. Lazarev took one look at the
draft and said yes.
And the rest, as they say, will be history after it is performed on
October 5. As for Tommy Fowler, he still can't believe his luck,
receiving such prime exposure within a few months of graduating from
university. At present he has no further commissions, but considers this
''the ideal way to get started''.
He'll be there, of course, on the fifth, but get somebody else to show
you to your seat that night.
* Royal SNO, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Thursday October 5, 7.30pm.

<FLAG>ANNUAL CONFERENCE</FLAG>

<TEXT>
Robbie Dinwoodie looks forward to the SNP's sixty-first conference
which, if it lives up to the pre-match publicity, will be stirring
THIS year's Scottish National Party conference promises to be vintage
stuff. All the elements are in place as the bravehearts gather in Perth
-- a buoyant position in the polls after a string of electoral
successes, neatly balanced by a familiar policy row and ugly talk of
personality clashes.
This has made it tempting for the media to look forward to the
sixty-first conference as a kind of Rob Roy style ''haggis Western'' --
a shoot-out between supporters of national convener Alex Salmond and his
opponents.
In the past few days it has been reported that Salmond's predecessor,
Gordon Wilson, has opened a party split, and that the party leader is
putting his credibility on the line over elections to party posts this
weekend.
Both suggestions speak volumes for the fragility that always seems to
underlie the party's good times.
For the record, Wilson denies that a recent speech by him was
divisive. In it he had argued that by putting in the kind of day-to-day
work necessary to combat rival parties, there was a danger of the SNP
putting too little emphasis on the longer-term goal and the aspirational
aspects of independence.
''It was intended as a thoughtful contribution and I went out of my
way to praise the leadership of Alex Salmond,'' he said yesterday. He
also placed himself firmly alongside his successor in saying that if
Labour introduced devolution the SNP must press on and use that as
another platform to win independence.
Nor did he think that the party elections posed any threat to the
leader's authority.
''Elections serve a purpose,'' he said. ''An organisation without some
kind of internal opposition is not exposed to scrutiny. On the other
hand, it is obviously better to have a united leadership team.
''As one who for many years as national convener did not command a
majority on the national executive, I can tell you Alex has no problems
just now. Even I am saying he is doing a good job!
''The party would be dead from the neck up if it didn't have
disagreements. If there were no personality clashes, it would mean there
were no personalities.''
The problem for outside observers is that the split between the
fundamentalists (who reject devolution) and the pragmatists (who would
highlight its shortcomings but harness it) is overlaid by personal
animosities.
Salmond said this himself in an interview in the current issue of the
Scottish Independent, where he called some colleagues ''over-excited,
gullible and voluble'' in pressing their fundamentalist stance of no
truck with devolution. He then added an attack on the personality
clashes which mar internal party business.
''There is nothing more frustrating in politics than the waste of time
and effort that is produced by internal party posturing,'' he said,
adding of an executive meeting involving ''a small minority of large
egos''.
Some would say Salmond was not obviously to the rear of the queue when
ego was disbursed, but he contrasted the bickering executive with
constructive meetings of the party's Scottish cabinet.
''The party is entitled to expect more of the latter and less of the
former from its collective leadership and this is the key judgment that
delegates should make as they choose the team best-fitted for office in
this crucial General Election run-up,'' he said.
The logic of this is that if delegates heed their national convener's
stated wishes next Saturday it will be bad news for the likes of Iain
Lawson, Alex Neil, Kenny MacAskill, Gil Paterson and Christine Creech.
In particular, the challenge by new MP Roseanna Cunningham against Neil
for the influential policy vice-convenership will be a key marker.
However, Salmond played down the talk of clashes and conflicts,
preferring to point instead to the encouraging facts of his party's
standings -- 26% in The Herald's most recent poll, against a backdrop of
historically high and rising support for independence, closing on the
1991 peak of 42%.
This record and the potential behind it, coupled to success in
European and council elections and the Perth and Kinross parliamentary
by-election allowed him to claim: ''I believe that under John Smith we
had Labour in our sights and now that the Tony Blair honeymoon is over
we have them in our sights once more.''
He said the party's policy formulation process was now more rigorous
than ever -- setting the aspirations for an independent Scotland, making
an economic case for what was possible, seeking feedback from experts
and interested groups, and asking conference to set priorities within
these goals.
In the next few months, he said, reports would spell out just how many
jobs could be created in Aberdeen if it was allowed to be a genuine
energy capital, how Glasgow might fare if it was a genuine media capital
and host to a Scottish broadcasting corporation, and what Edinburgh
might be like if it took its place among the capital cities of Europe.
This all sounded rather like Gordon Wilson's longer-range, strategic,
aspirational vision. ''The party has the right to look at the stars, to
have aspirations, as long as in the detail we keep our feet on the
ground. We have to be able to say to the people of Scotland, if you ask
us to govern, this is what we will do.''
The party would be dead from the neck up if it didn't have
disagreements. If there were no personality clashes, it would mean there
were no personalities

<RECORDNO>976290003</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS were under way yesterday to correct a Euro-blunder which could
wipe out an entire industry.
The trade in retread tyres has been outlawed unwittingly by the
wording of new legislation on car safety standards.
Neither Eurocrats nor Government Ministers noticed the error when the
directive on ''European Whole Type Approval'' was agreed, stipulating
that only new tyres can be fitted throughout the life of a car.
The intention was to ensure that only new tyres were fitted to new
cars.
The mistake was spotted by the Retread Manufacturers' Association,
which alerted the Department of Transport. The DoT referred the
organisation to the European Parliament.
Yesteray, Sheffield's Labour Euro-MP, Mr Roger Barton, was raising the
problem with Europe's commissioner for the single market, Mr Martin
Bangemann.
Mr Bangemann, famous for inadvertently scuppering prawn
cocktail-flavoured crisps in an earlier harmonisation scare, is certain
to amend the wording.
But Mr Barton said today: ''It is amazing that a piece of legislation
can be agreed by European governments without anyone realising that it
would make retread tyres illegal.
''If the law is not amended, motorists will have to pay more for
tyres, there will be job losses in the manufacture of retread tyres, and
the environmental problem of disposing of unwanted tyres will be made
even worse.''
He continued: ''Retread tyres are a form of recycling which we should
encourage. I am confident that the pressures from Euro-MPs will prompt
the commission to make amends, but this just shows that you can't leave
Euro decision-making to European governments.
''We need Euro-MPs to keep an eye on what they're up to.''

A BANK employee told an industrial tribunal yesterday he only
confessed to stealing #43,000 after police warned him of the hard time
he faced in jail.
Mr Austen Campbell, of The Auld Road, Cumbernauld Village, was
employed as a cash handler at the Clydesdale Bank's head office in
Glasgow until his dismissal in July, 1993.
Giving evidence yesterday Mr Campbell, 24, agreed he made a taped
confession on June 21, 1993, at Glasgow's Stewart Street police office
admitting to stealing the money.
But he claimed that as they sat in a car before he made the taped
confession, a detective ''told me he knew I had stolen it.
''He told me he knew where I hid it and told me he knew how I got it
out of the bank. He threatened me with going to Barlinnie.''
Asked later why he had admitted the theft on tape, Mr Campbell added:
''I was threatened with jail. I had been told in graphic detail about
the things that happen in jail.
''I had no solicitor there. I was stupid and I admitted it really
because the pressure was so much I wanted to get out of the place.''
Mr Campbell also claimed that Mr John Devlin, another bank employee,
had been charged with the theft of the #43,000 some six months before,
but ended up cited as a prosecution witness at his trial this year when
the case against Mr Campbell was found not proven.
The tribunal heard on Monday that #43,000 went missing at the bank's
cash-handling centre the previous November, after Mr Campbell had signed
for its delivery by Securicor.
The tribunal also heard that intensive but unsuccessful searches were
launched, first by bank staff and then by audit staff, to trace the
money.
Mr Colin Campbell, Clydesdale's audit manager, gave evidence on Monday
that while speaking to Detective Constable Robert Wardlaw at the bank in
June, 1993, on another matter, Mr Austen Campbell's name was mentioned.
Shortly afterwards the policeman revealed that Austen Campbell had
confessed to the November theft and disclosed that some of the money was
still hidden at the bank.
In a search Mr Colin Campbell, accompanied by the police, removed a
loose tile in the roof space above staff toilets and discovered #3000.
When asked if anyone else had been charged with the theft, Mr Colin
Campbell replied: ''Not to the best of my knowledge.''
And when asked: ''If you were told that John Devlin had been
interviewed and charged, would that come as a surprise?'' he replied:
''Yes, it would. I didn't know that.''
The tribunal will issue a written decision on Mr Campbell's claim of
unfair dismissal at a later date.

Theatre
IT seems incredible but it's true: Michael Feinstein is at last making
his West End debut at the Comedy Theatre in a three-week season,
previous appearances have been at places where people eat. Now the
talented singer/pianist has the spotlight all to himself and his Baldwin
piano.
I merely mention the latter because the ultra-fastidious performer
changes the words in his performance of Irving Berlin's classic song I
Love a Piano, the words that refer to a rival piano manufacturer.
Feinstein is one of the foremost collectors and disseminators of
popular songs, from Broadway and Hollywood. In his programme he pays
tribute to the great songwriters of the century: from Rodgers and Hart
and George Gershwin to the neglected genius of Harry Warren who wrote
more popular hits than anyone of his time.
In just over two hours we hear over 40 songs performed with aplomb and
great flair in a variety of styles from intimate to barnstorming.
Feinstein's personable and charming way with a song makes for an easy
relaxing evening's entertainment and what songs . . . well-known
favourites such as Embracable You, The More I See You and Summertime
share the limelight with lesser-known treasures. The latter include
Rhode Island is Famous for you, Such Sweet Sorrow and Let's Join the
Ladies. There are also some funny anecdotes and sly impersonations.
All in all An Evening With Michael Feinstein is an evening well spent.

A THEATRE employee who was sacked after a fire brigade released a tape
recording of an anonymous caller to his employer, has won his job back.
The taped call alleged that management at His Majesty's Theatre,
Aberdeen, were in breach of statutory safety precautions and asked a
brigade representative to inspect the theatre.
Mr Samuel Miller, of Craigievar Crescent, Garthdee, Aberdeen, was
employed as ''second flyman'' at the theatre until he was sacked in
October 1994. A flyman controls scenery lowered on stage.
An industrial tribunal has now ruled that he was unfairly dismissed,
ordered his reinstatement and awarded him #5750 compensation for loss of
earnings at the theatre owned by Aberdeen District Council.
The tribunal noted that theatre director Rob Robson was phoned while
on holiday by the theatre's technical manager, Mr John Kerr, and told
about the fire brigade call.
Suspicion fell on Mr Miller, who was working backstage at the time the
call was made.
Mr Miller admitted at an investigatory hearing on October 21, 1994,
that he had used the theatre phone but said it was to call his mother.
He was sacked by Mr Kerr after a disciplinary hearing seven days
later, on the grounds that he couldn't be trusted to resume his duties
in the theatre
Mr Kerr resigned from the theatre after Mr Miller's dismissal and
wasn't called as a witness at the tribunal hearing by the council.
Mr Miller appealed unsuccessfully to Mr Robson who maintained the
voice on the tape was that of Mr Miller, even though he had only spoken
to Mr Miller once since his appointment as director.
The tribunal was presented with a report from an independent
consultant in speech and language, which gave the opinion ''that any
identification by a lay person of the caller in this recording should be
regarded with extreme caution''.
In deciding Mr Miller had been unfairly dismissed the tribunal said
the local authority had broken the appeals procedure.
The tribunal also noted the council's failure to lead the evidence of
Mr Kerr and cast doubt on the positive

Stephen McGinty investigates how some 'Peter Pans' can defy attempts
to place them in an age bracket
HINDSIGHT has always blessed us with 20:20 vision. But judging by the
grainy photographs in yesterday's newspapers it would not take a
prescription for NHS spectacles to cast doubt on the age of education's
new Peter Pan. Brian McKinnon, alias Brandon Lee, looked like a
32-year-old and not a gangly 17-year-old, whose role he played so well.
''Why could teachers not tell? How could this happen? He's not 17,
he's 30 if he is a day.''
These questions have been asked across the country. Yet what are the
physiological differences between a 17-year-old and a mature male. Well,
not that many actually. While to the naked eye both can appear quite
different, burrow beneath the skin and little has changed.
Dr Robert Smith of the anatomy department of Glasgow University said:
''I heard it on the news and along with everybody else thought 'Gosh!
How could this be!' But then I thought about it. We have a great many
mature students in our university and somebody between the age of 25-30
could well blend in with a class of first years who are 17 or so. It's
really not as surprising as you might think.''
It is, of course, all dependent on the individual. There was always
the one guy in the school showers in second or third year who resembled
a walking carpet, matted with body hair while everyone else had to
contend with only the odd sprout. A mature 17-year-old could also be
close to his final height.
''The overall change which takes place between 17 and 32 is the
maturity of the skeleton. Your bones will not yet have stopped
growing,'' said Dr Smith. At 17 some people will be 95-98% of their
final height, others only 85% of their final height. The growth of the
long bones such as the femur will cease when the person reaches about 25
years old.
Another difference can be discovered by examining the skin. ''There is
the composition of the underlying connective tissues,'' said Dr Smith.
''The skin is slightly less resilient at the age of 30 as it is when you
are 17. If you pinch a 17-year-old then the skin will pop back to its
normal position more quickly than if the person was 30.''
Other variables such as grey hair, hair loss and wrinkles are related
to the individual. Some young people can begin to lose their hair in
their teens while 30-year-olds have perfect hair without a fleck of
grey. The actual ageing of the face and development of wrinkles is due
to a combination of genetic make-up and the life you lead.
''If you are up until 4am clubbing and consuming large quantities of
alcohol you are going to look older than if you take plenty of regular
exercise and have an early night.''
At 17 a male's voice has already broken and many have started to
shave. ''Seventeen-year-olds don't necessarily have bum-fluff. But it is
possible to conceal facial hair using creams; that is if you want to
hide a five o'clock shadow that is out by three in the afternoon.''
The changes to many older people's faces are as a result of weight
gain or loss.
Where the differences of age would appear to have been more profound
would have been in mental ability and attitude. Surprisingly a
32-year-old would not be quicker than a teenager. In classroom tests the
older person would be less mentally agile with a weaker memory. The peak
of mental ability in adults is between 17 and 24, from which there is a
slow, but steady decline.
In terms of attitudes, a 17-year-old would be more awkward when
talking to adults, he would display occasional elements of childish
behaviour such as the odd silly episode. Their attitude towards money
would be less responsible.
That Brandon Lee managed to maintain such a cover indicates, in the
eyes of Dr Eric Wilkinson, head of the education department at Glasgow
University, tremendous cunning.
''He must have been diligent and very cunning. He was in his own
school and there were teachers who would have taught there 14 years ago.
His idea was how not to stand out. How not to attract attention, so he
would have had to take up some school activities so not to be seen as an
outsider. I believe he took drama.
''You can either stand out by being confident and flamboyant or you
can be too shy and introverted. The key was to tread the middle ground.
He would have avoided individual tutorials and meetings with teachers,
avoided spending time with teachers and mingled in the crowds, which in
a big school like Bearsden Academy is easy to do.''
It is a description which matches Professor Bob Sturrock's memory of
Lee, who attended his lectures during his first term studying medicine
at Dundee University in 1994.
''The people you tend to notice are the extroverts and brilliant
pupils or the ones who are terrible. There is a whole middle section who
just get on with the job, and Brandon was part of that. He didn't,
however, look like a teenager. He looked like a mature student.''

HANDFULS of leaflets are being waved desperately at passers-by.
''Question authority!'' ''Smash the Criminal Justice Act!'' Same
anarchic slogans, but the Levellers' return to Glasgow is under
different circumstances from previous visits.
Following seven years of medium-level commercial success and regular
dismissal by critics, they have suddenly created a chart-topping album
and are rapidly gaining a new audience alongside their stereotypical
dreadlocked fans.
Zeitgeist has marked a rapid mood-swing and change of musical
direction for the band. The relaxed acoustic feel of much of their
previous material is mostly absent on the new album, and almost
non-existent in Monday night's concert. Old favourites such as The Boat
Man and Julie are avoided in the Levellers' drive towards a harder,
generally more aggressive style.
Opening with a frenzied rendition of The Fear, the crowd voiced
approval at the new material, although with the exception of Maid of the
River there is an air of disappointment at the lack of slower, more
sentimental songs.
When the Levellers do dip into their massive back-catalogue it's
generally to resurrect songs in the same aggressive vein as displayed on
Zeitgeist, such as River Flow and Battle of the Beanfield.
This new Levellers' sound is enjoyable in its own right, but they must
be careful not to dismiss seven years of fine work in the pursuit of
greater popularity.

THE Princess of Wales visited the Parkinson's Disease Research Centre
in King's College, London, yesterday.
The visit marked the college's designation as a ''centre of
excellence'' by the US-based National Parkinson Foundation, which has
donated #300,000 to the unit.
The princess (pictured right) has been the patron of the UK
Parkinson's Disease Society since 1989.
During the visit she mingled with sufferers and met some of the
research team striving to find a way to control the disease.
She asked one sufferer, 48-year-old Mrs Janet McNelly, a nurse from
Guildford in Surrey -- who was diagnosed as having Parkinson's five
years ago -- to sit and talk with her for a few minutes.
Mrs McNelly -- a member of the UK Parkinson's Disease Society's
management council -- said later: ''The princess obviously knows a lot
about Parkinson's Disease and knew it would be easier for me to sit.
''I've always admired her -- she showed genuine empathy.''
More than 120,000 people in the UK have the incurable disease with
some 10,000 diagnosed every year.

MAKING its European debut last night, Marabi is a musical celebration
of the slum culture of Johannesburg's black shanty towns of the thirties
and forties.
Big on research, the devised production by Junction Avenue Theatre
Company is based on Modikwe Dikobe's Marabi Dance -- shockingly, the
first novel about working-class life to be written by a black man in
South Africa, despite being published as recently as 1963.
Its themes are many, as are its insights into the too often unrecorded
history of black South African urban life. To a background of Marabi
music -- the rave music of its day in its popularity and political
import -- it is a portrait of a degraded but close-knit society, hungry
for escape and social betterment, and victim to economic exploitation
and cultural insecurity.
Graced by delicious a cappella harmonies and simple piano arrangements
that reveal the roots of boogie-woogie and gospel, Marabi is none the
less weakened by an uncertainty in its narrative. Rather than being
driven by the subversive pulse of the music, the show too often lets it
act as decoration for a multitude of plot lines that are never given
space to gather full emotional force.
Initially promising to be a modern-day Romeo and Juliet, for example,
it switches to a tale of unfair dismissal, and jumps again to a
documentation of the arrival of the Second World War.
For all that it is vigorously acted, Marabi is in the end rather too
ordinary a play, and rather too downbeat, to give a political charge to
material that deserves to be incendiary.

Government gives financial backing for new site.
CAMPAIGNERS against plans to close the Ayr fish market and move the
operation to Troon have reacted angrily to the news that the Scottish
Office is to give financial backing to the move.
They say that Ayr will be turned into a ''ghost port'' and that the
potential growth of the Clyde fishing fleet will be brought to an end.
Associated British Ports, which owns the ports at Ayr and Troon, wants
to close the fish market because it will not meet new EU hygiene
standards.
For several months there have been discussions going on with skippers
and fish merchants trying to persuade the company to change its mind and
develop either the existing site or one on the north side of the
harbour.
Yesterday, however, it was announced that grants totalling #155,000
from EU and Government sources have been awarded to ABP towards the cost
of building a new fish market at Troon.
Mr Raymond Robertson MP, Minister for Fisheries at The Scottish
Office, made the announcement as he began a three-day fact-finding tour
of fisheries interests in the north and west of Scotland.
Mr Robertson said: ''Access to a local fish market is crucial to
fishermen in the south-west of Scotland. The new fish market to be built
by Associated British Ports at Troon will ensure that EU fish hygiene
requirements are fully met and will accommodate the industry's long-term
interests.''
''I know that local interests have been discussing the appropriate
location for a market for some time and I know that there have been
mixed views on this aspect.
''It has been important that these views should be carefully
considered so that any alternative proposals could be fully explored.
ABP are the only group to have come forward with a firm proposal and the
necessary financial provision. Against that background, and with the
current market planned to close in a few months, a decision was needed
now to safeguard the industry's long-term interests.''
Mr Peter Walker, of the Ayr Wholesale Fish Buyers' Association, said:
''This looks like the final nail in the coffin of a genuine wish by many
people to see Ayr fish market stay in business.
''We are about to see Ayr turned into a ghost port with a few freight
ships on the North Harbour side. Worse still we are seeing 774 years of
fine fishing tradition washed down the River Ayr.''
Mr Walker and his supporters had come forward with two plans -- one
for each side of the harbour -- but had feared for some time that their
pleas were falling on deaf ears.
He added: ''Not only are we seeing the current fleet forced up to
Troon which has facilities for fewer boats but I believe we can wave
goodbye to any chance of the deep sea fleet looking to the Ayrshire
coast as a landing point in the future.
''The customer will also suffer as we will have to look further afield
for fish and will have to pay much more to carry it by road to the shops
and restaurants.
''The whole thing has been done because ABP wants to maximise profits
and sell off valuable land in Ayr. We are angry and disappointed at the
outcome.''
Mr Philip Condliffe, port manager at Ayr and Troon, said: ''I can
sympathise with those who feel that a long tradition is about to die at
Ayr. But we have to be realistic and other developments around the
harbour have made the current market site totally unsuitable.''
''We have excellent sea and land side facilities at Troon and I
believe that if in the future there is a demand for extra boats to use
the harbour we will be able to meet it.''
The aspect of the deal which has angered campaigners most is that
their plans would have cost around half of the #700,000 the new market
will cost.

WITH a great crashing and stamping of feet, Stomp have returned to
London, briefly, in a hail of glory. Luke Cresswell and his YES/NO
People (the first to create the bovver-boot, dirty overall building site
chic) are still beating out syncopated rhythms like demented dustmen on
anything they can lend their hands -- including, literally, the kitchen
sink.
Stomp is now big business -- award-winning ad videos, sell-out tours
wherever they go and an all-American subsidiary cast packing them in at
New York's Orpheum Theatre for the past year.
But the energy, and the hunger seem as great as ever, the show even
more spectacular with the addition of an extra cast of a dozen or more
younger performers and a climax which includes a quartet of dalek-like
objects -- four performers in ski boots atop giant oil drums.
If the aggro and decibel count equally seems more pronounced
Cresswell's own sly all-embracing charm and humour, and the brilliance
of the invention serve as a counter-balance.
They're still geniuses of the street, urban jazzmen and women for our
time tapping out new optimism from the muck and detritus of city life --
plastic bags, bits of rubber piping, packing cases. No wonder audiences
from Brighton to Japan (and soon South America after the Festival Hall
and the Acropolis in Athens), warm to them so easily and find them so
irresistible. The rest of the UK, though, it seems, will have to wait a
while before enjoying their unique skills again.

<TEXT>
SENIOR colleagues of a surgeon who conducted experimental operations
to prevent hip fractures in elderly women, in which one patient died,
had expressed serious reservations about the project.
A fatal accident inquiry into the death of 70-year-old Phyllis Moffitt
heard that more than one surgeon approached by the Aberdeen
University-led research team refused to refer patients under their care
to the project.
The inquiry heard Mrs Moffitt died of a heart attack on the operating
table last August, during surgery to strengthen her right hip, after
being given a sedative to ease discomfort.
The innovative technique involved volunteer patients, who had already
suffered a fractured hip, having their other hip bone strengthened with
an injection of ceramic paste under anaesthetic.
Dr Srimathi Murali, the consultant surgeon who carried out the
procedure, admitted yesterday that one colleague felt the project's
objectives did not justify the risks involved.
''He did not think the project was a good idea. A query was raised
that the hole drilled in the bone to inject the material might itself
weaken the bone,'' said Dr Murali.
Within a short time of having had his hip operated on, one patient
returned to hospital with a fracture to that same joint, the inquiry
heard.
Agent for Mrs Moffitt's family, Mr Reg Christie, claimed fears about
Dr Murali's approach were raised at an orthopaedic sub-committee
meeting.
''Was there not a more general objection expressed that you were
carrying out these procedures on a very frail component of the
population -- one which, by its nature, would be less able to cope with
operational procedures?'' he asked.
''Yes, I was aware of that opinion being expressed by a number of
surgeons,'' replied Dr Murali.
''These surgeons went as far as to exclude their patients from the
project,'' said Mr Christie.
He said one surgeon had claimed there was a risk that when the paste
was injected into the patient, it could lead to fatty tissue being
ejected into the bloodstream, creating a blockage, or embolism.
The inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court was adjourned until October 4.

HOW can someone square the deaths of 1.2 million men, women and
children against their conscience? Through hate, emotional numbness, or
an obstinate focus on trivial details which deny the horror any potency,
which refuse to allow death to seep through obsessive statistics about
discipline, order and cleanliness?
Robert David MacDonald's adaptation of Into That Darkness, Gitta
Sereny's account of her interviews with Franz Stangl, the Austrian
commandant at the infamous Nazi extermination camp at Treblinka in
Poland, is a rigorous, probing exploration of man's ability to deny his
own humanity, presenting a portrait of a man whose most monstrous
characteristic is his very ordinariness.
The man who coolly oversaw wholescale massacre casually protesting
that he wore white riding gear in the midst of the carnage not out of
sadistic vanity but because it was so hot, is also a family man fiercely
passionate about his wife and daughters and one who tearfully recalls a
childhood Christmas, of racing out into the snow in her new slippers and
the subsequent beating at the hands of a harsh father.
Originally performed by the Citizens' Theatre Company last April, the
play was reprised for a one-off reading as part of a weekend conference
on drama and performance organised by Glasgow University's Department of
Theatre Studies.
Brendan Hooper, currently performing in The Ebb Tide replaces Henry
Ian Cusick as the male chorus but otherwise the original cast again take
up their roles; Joanna Tope, a study in denial and protested innocence
as Stangl's wife, Roberta Taylor deadly assured and composed as Stangl's
inquisitor, Sereny, and MacDonald himself chillingly realising the
complexities of the commandant who resists the demands made on his
conscience.

THE sentiments are so laudable, the message so urgent, but Ernst
Toller's The Machine Wreckers in this English adaptation by Ashley Dukes
now has the feel itself of something of an old Luddite.
Based on the nineteenth-century English Luddites who tried to stop the
introduction of the weaving machine by destroying it, it's not that
Toller's crie de coeur is any less true now than in 1922 when he wrote
it or that the force of his apocalyptic vision of capitalism's
destructiveness setting the planet against itself is not, in our
environmentally challenged times, coming to pass. It's simply that in
dramatic terms, how Toller's Marx and Engels influence demarcations
between workers and managers now comes over as far too crude and
simplistic, like some old piece of 1970s agit-prop.
And yet, heaven knows, the soul of the piece about exploitation, the
disparity between boss and worker, the fickleness of individuals, the
potential strength of collective action and capitalism's ultimately
deceitful rationalisation that such developments would free us all up
for more leisure-time, cries out to be heard.
Sadly, however, Katie Mitchell's stolidly neo-realistic production in
Dukes's equally worthy translation, undermines a play that even in the
twenties was a major plank of the German expressionist movement.
With its symbolism and mythic overtones (the workers' attribution of
almost animalistic properties to The Machine, the killing of Jimmy
Cobbett, the visionary middle-class worker in a very Christ-like
sacrifice) the play demands a theatre of grand gesture. Despite a fine
cast, unfortunately this production renders a heart-felt play into an
embarrassingly heavy-handed one.

THE more you look -- the more you see. A thought that doubles nicely
as a directive to the lovers -- who fall in and out of lurrve in the
blink of an eye -- and to Scottish Ballet's audiences, whom I trust will
book early, book often, for this Dream. It really is a work that can
stand several viewings. Initially, of course, what strikes you is the
look of the thing: Norberto Chiesa's scrumptious costumes swirl and
dapple with vibrant colour, while the white set -- in the main, a rising
escarpment -- lends itself to dramatic washes of strong primary hues
that echo the emotional shadings within the unsettled woods.
Robert Cohan's choreography, too, is immediately pleasing -- a lively
mix of styles that encompasses pointe work, tap dance, contemporary
movement, and a twinkling of balletic pastiche, all picking up on the
atmospheres and shapeliness of Mendelssohn's glorious score (caringly
and imaginatively extended by Barrington Pheloung).
But -- and this is one of the underlying themes of the Dream --
eyecatching appearances are not the whole story. Cohan's version of
Shakespeare's comedy repeatedly points up the fragile, transient nature
of purely physical attraction -- just look at poor Hermia (a poignantly
distraught Catherine Evers) bereft of her sugar-pink idyll, or deceived
Titania (Daria Klimentova), rutting with an ass and all because Puck
(Campbell McKenzie) has drawn the wool, or rather a Nijinksy-esque veil,
over susceptible eyes.
McKenzie's buoyant athleticism comes into its own here, but he's an
earthy, rather than an elemental, Puck -- more Oberon's henchman than
his mystic creature.
Noriko Ohara is a stately, serene Hippolyta, strongly partnered by
Simon Stewart, their duets providing the maturer vision of relationships
that throw into hectic relief the maddened escapades of the other
lovers.
Lots of poised, secure dancing, throughout in a staging that has been
subtly refined since its premiere in 1993. Even so, the resonant levels
of subtlety are still there, undisturbed -- a third, a sixth, an endless
number of viewings will reveal more and more each time.

Theatre
MAYBE it was an age thing, but it was the undoubtedly the female,
teenage contingent of the school party-packed audience which seemed to
be most seduced by Theatre Babel's latest take on the Shakepeare
romance. That their Romeo (Derek Johnston) was nigh on ravishing might
also have been a factor.
The young Glaswegian theatre company has stated its intention to
attract a new audience to classical plays and the way it set about doing
so in the case of Romeo and Juliet was by emphasising the youthfulness
of the characters (most of whom are teenagers) and the sexual aspects of
the script. The bawdy (and oft-times immature) double act of Peter
Collins's laddish Mercutio and Mark Stevenson's Benvolio attracted the
most laughs, and the balcony scene was less about Romeo pining under the
stars and more about Romeo fishing for a fumble with the gauche Juliet
(Rebecca Rodgers).
Rodgers played Juliet as she should be: giggling and girlish (she
looks like Alice in Wonderland), and in the first throes of puppy love.
She only becomes more mature (though no less irritating) because events
get out of control.
Although not anchored in any particular period, the cast was bedecked
in nineteenth-century garb. The sparse set gave no further clues, and on
one occasion, the Capulets danced the Dashing White Sergeant. The music,
which linked the scenes, effectively cast an air of gloom and
inevitability over the proceedings. In all, a refreshing slant on
Shakespeare.

REPORTING a slight rise in interim profits from #8.36m to #8.67m in
the 28 weeks ended July 16, cooked meat manufacturer Bernard Matthews
warns of significantly increased costs in the UK in the second half
resulting mainly from increases in grain prices due to the forecast
world shortage of wheat.
''Against this background it is impossible to understand the logic of
the continuing European policy of the 'setaside' programme which pays
farmers not to grow grain,'' complains chairman Bernard Matthews.
The interim dividend is lifted from 1.32p to 1.39p.

operating company winning contracts worth almost #17m, writes GRAEME
SMITH.
Lloyd Helicopters has agreed a long-term renewal with Total
Exploration and Production to provide support for the Bongkot gas field
off the south Thailand coast.
New contracts have been signed with Occidental Exploration Philippines
Inc and TransAsia Oil for twin engined helicopter support for
exploration activities in the Philippines, and in India two helicopters
will be used by Command Petroleum to support its Ravva oil field
development 500km north of Madras.
''These new business successes provide the basis for continued
expansion into the South-East Asian and Indian regions, and we foresee
further important developments in these areas,'' said Bond managing
director Stephen Bond.
''The Command Petroleum award is of particular importance as it
represents a major step into the Indian offshore market. We are
optimistic this will lead to additional long-term contracts in this
expanding region.''
The contracts will be handled by Lloyd Helicopters which was acquired
by Bond two years ago and is Australia's largest helicopter operator.

Wm Low proves to be stunning acquisition for supermarket chain.
TESCO believes it is now clearly ahead of arch-rival J Sainsbury after
increasing sales for the first 24 weeks by 25.6% to #5891m and raising
its market share from 10.6% to 12.6%.
That was helped by like-for-like turnover jumping by 10% with
inflation accounting for 4% and volume for 6%. Sales were also boosted
by the hot summer which send demand for refreshments and seasonal food
soaring.
But the overall group performance on this score pales into
insignificance compared with the Wm Low advance of 25.6% in the 57
Scottish and North of England outlets aquired just over a year ago.
Low's turnover amounted to #270m and generated #13m of operating
profit or almost as much as it earned in a full year under the previous
management.
Its margins should improve from 5% to 8% as the benefits of the #25m
reorganisation programme work their way through.
Chairman Sir Ian Maclaurin said that Low, which was rebranded as Tesco
in February, had been a stunning purchase which had helped propel Tesco
into joint second place in the Scottish grocery market.
It has so far cost #300m including the original acquisition price and
some #20m is being spent over the next 12 months in refitting around 20
stores. It is hoped to sell petrol at a number of these.
The Metro concept of smaller in-town stores has proved highly
successful, with a new opening next year in Dunblane to complement the
existing one in Glasgow as part of a programme to raise the number to
about 25.
Overall group pre-tax profits rose 15.1% to #290m excluding property
surpluses.
Margins in the original Tesco have remained steady at 6%, held back
partly by the costs of launching the highly-successful Clubcard loyalty
incentive. That cost #25m in payments to the six million customers and
another #5m in administration, but the benefit has been a rise in sales
of around #100m and established Tesco far ahead of its rivals in this
marketing technique.
Sir Ian disputed that there had been a rise in supermaret margins and
pointed to the 0.3% fall in gross margins.
The improvement in volumes had come from emphasising customer care,
pricing such as the New Deal initiative as well as the introdution of
4000 new product lines in the last two years.
It has been more than able to fight off the discounters who have seen
the overall market share decline in the last year from 8.4% to 7.9%
although they intend opening about 190 new stores this year.
Tesco itself will spend #700m on new outlets this year which will
raise the total by 25 to 542 including a handful of Express stores.
Part of the expenditure will be utilised in expanding the Catteau
supermarkets in France and also Global in Hungary.
The interim dividend has been increased 13% to 3.05p.
The shares dropped 9[1/2]p to 323[1/2]p as the figures were much in
line with market expectations with the payout perhaps less than hoped.

THERE is something missing at the heart of Sam Mendes's The Glass
Menagerie. Maybe it's the curse of closure hanging over the head of his
embattled theatre, but where there should be an emotional vortex, a
sense of characters clinging for their lives, there is instead cool
modernism.
Tennessee Williams's arguably most autobiographical play is a thing of
trembling fragility, shimmering memories and blistering guilt -- a
portrait of the artist tearing himself away from a claustrophobic
household dominated by a suffocating mother and a much-loved sister
(whose disability Williams miraculously transformed into a thing of
beauty) -- but never quite being able to reconcile the cost of that
breaking free.
''Laura, has anybody told you how beautiful you are?'' says Mark
Dexter's gentleman caller to Claire Skinner's luminous misfit. ''You
should be kissed by someone.'' It is the one moment of real emotional
tremor in an otherwise disappointing if seductive evening, bathed by
David Hersey's ravishing sapphire blue lighting and framed within Rob
Howell's clattering, atmospheric tenement fire escape and parapet
surround.
Mendes's venture into the steamy southern hothouse makes him look and
almost feel like some distant relation to Design for Living -- Sean
Mathias' recent successful revival at the Donmar of Noel Coward's
menage-a-trois. Perhaps they are -- but they shouldn't be.
And even the usually magnificent Zoe Wanamker touches wrong notes in
Amanda Wingfield, the monstrous mother, choosing to emphasise her comic,
stoical side (certainly part of her make-up) rather than the
self-deluding woman living absurdly -- and destructively -- in the past.
Ben Chaplin as the nascent writer broods attractively but without focus.

TRAVEL
SALTCOATS-based AT Mays, the UK's third-largest travel agent, revealed
that the suspension of the Troubles had played a part in its move into
Northern Ireland, which was confirmed yesterday.
AT Mays' expansion into the Province follows similar ones by Lunn
Poly, owned by Thomson Holidays, and Airtours-owned Going Places in
June.
However, AT Mays has been planning its entry into the Northern Irish
travel market since the beginning of the year.
The company has acquired long-established Belfast firm Hamilton
Travel, which has its office in the city centre.
AT Mays, which hopes to have 20 branches in Northern Ireland by
Christmas, has signed franchise deals with Cameron's Travel, Henry Gowan
Travel, and Terra Travel, which between them have 13 outlets in the
Province.
These associate branches will effectively trade as AT Mays' outlets,
selling packages negotiated nationally by the company. However, they
will retain an element of their own identity.
Commenting on the decision to move into the Province, AT Mays
marketing director Roddie MacPhee said: ''If a company wishes to be
truly national, as we do, then we really want to be covering every part
of the UK and an obvious omission in that total game-plan was Northern
Ireland.
''The fact that the climate has settled down considerably has, I
think, encouraged many businesses to look at Northern Ireland in a
different light. Travel is no different from anything else.''
Thomas Cook, which recently lost its place as the third-largest UK
travel agent to AT Mays, was the only one of the four major multiples to
have had a presence in the Province during the Troubles.
In June, Going Places, which is second in size only to Lunn Poly,
acquired 18 branches with the takeover of Ulster's leading travel agent,
McCalla.
Lunn Poly itself, with an expansion strategy focused on the opening of
new outlets rather than the takeover of existing firms, set up shop in
the Province the same month.
The incursion of the major UK travel agents should benefit the people
of Northern Ireland, who will be able to access deals which the four
major multiples have been able to negotiate with tour operators and fly
from their home airport.
AT Mays' Northern Irish expansion will take its branch network through
the 400-mark. Lunn Poly has about 750 outlets and Going Places about
650. Thomas Cook has some 380.
The company, which was founded in a wooden hut in the 1950s by wartime
pilot Jim Moffat, was sold to Royal Bank of Scotland in 1987. Two years
later it was acquired by Carlson of Minneapolis, which has a string of
travel and leisure interests including restaurant chain TGI Fridays.

Paul Welsh looks at the growing support for art in prison as
recreation, therapy, and education
Publicity surrounding art for offenders is usually very negative
MICHAEL Howard's proposal this week to set up a trial American-style
''boot camp'' for young offenders may have met with the approval of the
Scottish Police Federation, but it has come at a time when many
professionals working in the prison service are moving in the opposite
direction.
The Home Secretary's announcement seems designed to curry favour in
advance of the Conservative Party conference, a sop to the sensibilities
of people who find softer approaches to offenders unpalatable.
But there is growing support elsewhere for the use of art in prison,
and the two balls most frequently kicked between opposing views are
those of cause celebre Jimmy Boyle -- the convicted murderer turned
sculptor and writer -- and Barlinnie Prison's recently disbanded Special
Unit. With widespread public scepticism and hostility usually the order
of the day, professionals have persevered with the artist approach and
from among their number, the call has gone out for further development
and integration of their schemes in Scotland.
''Arts-based initiatives for offenders need a catalyst to bring them
together. As things stand it is twice as hard as it should be to get
funding because proposals are coming in from all angles and the
situation is haphazard. Projects that should be working together are
effectively competing.''
Trudy Gibson is a founding member of Out of the Blue, an
Edinburgh-based trust and gallery. With proposals pending for Her
Majesty's correctional facilties at Corton Vale, Polmont, and
Barlinnine, she has successfully placed trained artists in a number of
Scottish prisons but has no illusions of how this work is viewed.
''Art is seen by the public as a cushy number for prisoners when it is
not, and people working in the area are reluctant to talk about it
because the publicity surrounding art for offenders is usually so
negative.''
Normally one of the quiet ones herself, she now believes this enforced
silence is undermining development of a countrywide initiative needed to
properly utilise the resources and talent available. Art is not being
fully exploited and this may simply be the reflection of the status quo.
Without a general willingness to accept that art for offenders could
be a good thing, organisations and individuals keep their heads down. As
often as not however, the critics miss the point.
When the doors finally closed on Barlinnie's Special Unit, Governor
Susan Brooks moved on to the challenge of the National Induction Centre
at Shotts Prison outside Glasgow. With this new centre due to open in
the autumn, the NIC is there to help long-term prisoners settle into the
system. Art is recognised as an important part of the Shotts regime
which involves a structure programme of activity geared to individual
requirements.
''None of my prison colleagues see art as a cushy number. Used in a
co-ordinated way alongside counselling, some very demanding group work
and more traditional forms of work, art is an appropriate way of dealing
with the issues we are interested in and equally as challenging as any
other approach,'' she says.
''So many people in the prison system arrive with under-developed
social skills and these inabilities are heightened in this environment.
It is more difficult to get under someone's veneer and art is a good way
of helping someone express themselves in this situation. This is
necessary if we are to get to the bottom of offending behaviour and stop
some people re-offending again.''
Tina McGeever, arts officer for Strathclyde Regional Council, thinks
this is significant because it represents a different form of
initiative.
''Art can act as pre- employment training, a focus for group work,
discipline, goal setting and achievement through performance which all
help an individual's development.''
This applies inside and outside of prison.
One of the hidden spin-offs of Glasgow's much maligned year of culture
is that social workers have started to use art more and more. The aim is
to make it an integral part of their efforts in the city and this
includes work with offenders and ex-offenders.
With Out of the Blue pushing art as a way for prisoners to release
mental, physical, and emotional energy, this three-tier structure of art
for recreation, therapy, and education seems sound. As all parties point
out however, the present commitment to art is still falling short.
''Prison managers probably do not have as great an understanding of
the potential of art and the range that is available as I would like,''
says Brooks.
''An organisation that could analyse the needs of the prisoner in
relation to art and advise on its applications would be beneficial but
currently there is nothing like that.''
And this further development of structured programmes on the inside
would not be the end of it. With the fate of ex-offenders also an
important issue, a significant number of prisoners do want to continue
with their art on release but find there is little support and
practically no funding for this.
''A direct channel into arts organisations from prison schemes needs
to be established,'' says Gibson of Out of the Blue. ''And there is an
argument for creating a specialised half-way house that would do a
similar job to Sacro but working specifically in relation to the arts.
With the existence of initiatives in prison, this is logical.''
Sacro, the country's long established penal reform group, offers
counselling, advice, and drop-in services to ex-offenders throughout
Scotland. With offices stretching from the Orkneys to the Borders, the
organisation is there to help offenders to readjust to life on the
outside, along with the universal goal of lowering levels of
re-offending. Concentrating primarily on resettlement and resolving
disputes however, it does not offer any creative workshops.
''There is a lamentable lack of opportunity for ex-offenders in
Scotland,'' says company press officer Rhona Connelly. ''But the funding
and legislative constraints on Sacro limit what we can do. However, we
support any local groups and specialists better equipped than ourselves,
who want to develop additional programmes for people on their release
from prison.''
Away from all the philosophy and good intentions this whole debate may
boil down to money. Why should public funds be spent on prisoners when
many law-abiding citizens do not have the same opportunities? There is
both a simple and complex answer to this.
Regardless of whether courts impose longer sentences, new jobs are
created in prisons, or a variety of goals are pursued through a channel
like art, there is no escaping a budget. Every method of correction and
ultimately support costs the taxpayer money and they all work to a
greater or lesser extent with different people.
While some offenders are probably ''on the make'' -- a dose of
painting or drama is easily swallowed when the alternative could be the
equivalent of Howard's boot camp -- art can be a revelation to others.
This exposure to it helps keep someone out of prison and out of crime,
the community is better off in a number of ways and the programme has to
be rated a success.
This appears to be the case and for a society that prides itself on
the power of its culture seeing the situation any differently is
hypocritical.
From Pulp Fiction to Cezanne,people are proud to admit that art in a
written, visual, or oral form can affect them in profound ways and it
may be time for the art-loving mainstream to finally acknowledge that
the same could be true for someone who has broken the law.
But many critics of art in prison are just victims of an obvious
snobbery. The low social status of ''a criminal'' might prevent them
from being an artist in the eyes of some, but this has not stopped
others recognising their talent with the porridge equivalent of the
Turner, the Koestler Award, now an established fact.
Free of unnecessary baggage, art remains powerful stuff. In the hands
of skilful people who appreciate this fact and those who are in need of
some strong self-administered medicine, the results can be dramatic. If
Michael Howard and the rest of us are to believe the professionals,
thinking any differently could be the biggest crime of all

THERE'LL be a few laughs and a few tears by the end of this week. In
1978, the late Sir Alexander Gibson asked Jean Kidd to become musical
director of a new chorus, the SNO (now RSNO) Junior Chorus: from tots to
teens, unbroken voices as and when required -- from Mahler symphonies to
carols at Christmas.
In the ensuing 17 years, Jean Kidd has become a quiet legend,
nurturing excellence, and planting seeds for more than a few musical
careers. Now she is retiring, and the New Atheneum Theatre of the RSAMD
is this week the scene for a gala concert, directed by the soft-spoken
lady herself, to mark the occasion. Last night, the first of three, was
pretty much a demonstration of the standards she has established. Those
attending tonight and tomorrow night (both sold out) are in for a treat.
The children, performing from memory all night, have, in their
singing, a level of technical and musical confidence that is deceptive;
it is so assured and of such ease that you have to remind yourself that
what they are singing is actually very difficult. The cascading,
crowding lines of Britten's This Little Babe, the bright, sustained flow
of Mendelssohn's Laudate Pueri, the brilliantly articulated and witty J
S Bach, and the warmth of the Scottish folk song selection; all of these
are cases in point.
The second half was given over to a performance of the opera Up Your
Street, built around Glasgow, its places, and its street songs. Joined
by adults and an orchestra, the RSNO Juniors gave a touching performance
of a fully staged, warmly orchestrated, and rather attractive piece.

HALLOWE'EN may be the start of a real horror story if you don't get
your tax return back to the Inland Revenue by October 31, warns Touche
Ross tax partner Maurice Perry-Wingfield.
''Strictly speaking, you should have sent your tax return back 30 days
after receiving it'', he explains. However, the Inland Revenue realises
this may be unrealistic, and so requires tax returns to be in its hands
by October 31.
People who fail to meet the deadline risk being charged interest but
more to the point certain 1994-95 tax liabilities are due on December 1.

REVITALISED textiles group S Jerome &amp; Sons suffered from the warm
summer which reduced demand for woollens and tweeds. But while sales of
sock yarns have improved rapidly in recent weeks, tweeds remain under a
bit of a cloud with the Gardiners of Selkirk operation in for a dull
autumn, according to chairman Alan Jerome.
But almost everywhere else the mood is highly positive. Overall
volumes are up by 15% in the last couple of months with worsted weaving
well ahead.
In the half-year to June, overall turnover edged ahead to #14.5m
although indirect overseas sales improved by 12% to #3.93m.
Pre-tax profits rose 35% to #467,000 or 24% after disregarding a
property sale surplus.
The interim has been raised by half to 0.75p, leaving the shares of
the increasingly ambitious company at 77p trading at nine times likely
earnings with a 3.6% yield.

GEEST shares rose 5p to 191p yesterday following a report that the
food processor and distributor was selling its banana importing business
to Ecuador's Noboa Corporation for #75m.
A Geest spokeswoman declined to comment on the report in the Daily
Telegraph, but the company may break its silence on the reported deal
when it announces interim results tomorrow.
Geest controls about 10% of the European banana market and sells #200m
of bananas a year, but City analysts said the banana trade was a
volatile business and a sale would make good sense.
Over the past two years Geest's banana imports have been hit by
hurricane damage to plantations in the West Indies and disease on a new
plantation in Costa Rica.
The company has a banana ripening depot at Carrionbridge near Wishaw
which supplies Scotland and employs about 30 people.
Geest also owns the Caledonian vegetable packing plant at Shieldness
in East Lothian. This packs Scottish tomatoes and potatoes for the
retail trade and employs nearly 100 people.

WITH just one lung, and its function reduced rapidly, Ida Hatt has
been housebound for two-and-a-half-years. She and her husband, Charles,
who was 80 last month, have meals-on-wheels delivered to them by Alex
Wright of the WRVS twice a week, to their home in Knightswood, Glasgow.
''I'm on oxygen 24 hours-a-day, I can't do anything,'' explains Mrs
Hatt, who is 72. ''Meals-on-wheels is a big help for my husband, we've
no family near and he does the shopping and cooking. We have the soup at
lunchtime; we keep the main course to have in the evening with the
pudding.''
Her husband adds: ''It's good and we get ample. I manage to do the
necessary cooking the rest of the time -- the tin opener is never out of
my hand.''
TO be able to go on living at home is the ardent desire of most
elderly people. For some, declining physical and sometimes mental powers
mean it is simply not a feasible option, and a permanent place in a
nursing home is the only route available, unless there is a family
member able to undertake 24-hour care.
But there are other sources of help and advice which may assist in
putting together a package of care for a person wishing to remain at
home, yet who is unable to cope entirely without help.
The first ports of call should be the general practitioner or your
local social work department, to see if they can make helpful
suggestions.
Under the Community Care Act, local authorities now have a duty to
assess those who seem to be in need of services. These include home
helps or home care, respite care and meals-on-wheels.
Social work departments in the various local authorities have slightly
different workings, including whether or not you will have to pay. Some
of the most common services include adaptations to homes, or gadgets
which could help in accomplishing certain tasks, for example special
taps, or devices which help pull people out of bed, wheelchairs,
commodes, amplifiers for telephones or TV, grab rails or a ramp to the
door.
An occupational therapist from the social work department is probably
the best person for advice, and the Red Cross, WRVS, your local Age
Concern and some other organisations may also be able to help by lending
aids.
Alarm systems which ''call for help'' can be invaluable for old people
living alone or who can't get out, and may be available through social
work departments or from private firms. Contact your local Help The Aged
branch which will advise you on how to contact their community alarm
department.
Day care comes in many categories from socialising, activities and a
meal, to specialised care for people with dementia, for instance.
Sometimes day care is available at weekends, or for long days, to allow
a carer to go to work. In rural parts, day care may be laid on in mobile
centres. Contact your local Age Concern Scotland, your local Alzheimer's
Scotland group; local stroke group or Carers' group, or social work
departments.
Respite care enables both the person being looked after and their
carer to get a break from one another, and can vary from a very short
period to one or two weeks. It may be arranged in the person's home, a
residential or nursing home, or hospital. Contacts as before, or GP.
A home help or home care assistant may be available to help with a
broad range of tasks, which could include a greater degree of ''care''
than the traditional cleaning/shopping role of the past. Social work
departments, Age Concern, Crossroads or private agencies are sources to
contact.
Meals-on-wheels may be run by Age Concern or WRVS groups for the
council, and can offer meals for special diets, or even provide freezers
in houses with frozen meals delivered for someone to heat themselves
when they wish. Contact locally the social work department, Age Concern
or the WRVS.
Your GP is the key to community health services which may be available
at home. These include the district nurse or health visitor,
chiropodist, continence advisor, physiotherapist, community psychiatric
nurse, hospice at home or Macmillan Nurse.
Finally, send for an invaluable comprehensive guide to the whole
complex area of sources of help: Fact Sheet 6, from Age Concern
Scotland, 113 Rose Street, Edinburgh, EH2 3DT, and enclose an sae 9in x
6in.

BILL Gredley, one of Britain's leading owners, is halving his racing
and breeding operation.
The owner and breeder of User Friendly and Environment Friend is
cutting his racehorse string from 35 to 20, selling the 600-acre Middle
Park Stud in Newmarket, and reducing his broodmares from 60 to 30.
His breeding interests will be concentrated at Stetchworth Park Stud
with his runners spread among trainers Clive Brittain, Barry Hills, and
James Fanshawe.
Gredley, who has enjoyed classic success with Oaks and St Leger winner
User Friendly, believes that by rationalising he has a better chance of
returning to the big race arena.
''I am rationalising against economics and racing in the future. I
think the issue is changing every day and I have to recognise the way
economies are going,'' he said.
''You are sending horses around the country with the cost of training
and transport and the rest, and when you do get there and manage to win
the prize money is just a nonsense.
''Rather than do all that I will just continue to look for good
horses. If they come along I will be happy and if not so what. It's
difficult to compete with cannon-fodder and hopefully next year will be
better.''
Gredley, who has interests in property, bus companies, and oil, has
put a #3m asking price on the stud. He believes more prize money and
less racing of a better quality will ease the problems of the racehorse
owner.
''The training bill is roughly #15,000 a year per horse and I am
making a substantial loss. In more than one year I have made a seven
figure loss,'' he added.
''I'm not getting out. I am organising to give myself a better chance.
If I carried on, with the way racing is programmed at the moment, there
would be no future.''

* AN irate owner was fined #275 by the Nottingham stewards yesterday
after verbally abusing jockey Gary Hind.
Angry Michael Clarke gave Hind a blasting after his wife Jennie's
horse, The Deaconess, had finished a well-beaten eighth in the Bristol
Street Motors (Sherwood) Maiden Stakes (Division 2).
The officials found Clarke guilty of improper conduct on the
racecourse under rule 220 (part ii) and fined him the minimum. Stewards'
secretary Phil Tuck said: ''This is unusual and I can't remember the
last time a jockey made a complaint about an owner.
''Apparently the man was upset because the horse was fly-leaping and
he wasn't happy with the way Hind had ridden the horse.
''He's entitled to his opinion but it would be fair to say that the
stewards took the view that there was nothing wrong with Hind's
riding.''

GOVERNMENT Ministers were warned yesterday that council reorganisation
could descend into chaos if they continue to keep the lid on public
sector pay rises, writes Frances Horsburgh, Local Government
Correspondent.
Scottish leaders of Unison, the public services union, said industrial
action ''looked inevitable'' next year because of the Government's
determination that -- for the third year running -- pay rises for their
local authority members must be paid for by efficiency savings.
Mr Mark Irvine, the union's head of local government in Scotland,
claimed such savings could only be achieved by imposing massive cuts in
jobs and services.
''Public sector workers will not allow themselves to become scapegoats
for the mess this Government has made of the economy,'' he said.
Industrial action could coincide with the handover of power on April
1, 1996 to the 29 new unitary councils.
Meanwhile, Scotland's water workers yesterday accepted a pay rise of
3.5% -- 1% more than last year.
Their leaders immediately called for talks with the three new water
quangos.

Ross Finlay looks at a 4x4 with a Mercedes engine
WITH my time of departure just a little neat for a run to the ferry at
Stranraer, I was trying to start the SsangYong Musso, which refused to
co-operate, even though I had certainly gone through the correct
manoeuvre to bypass its Cobra alarm system.
A certain amount of panic was creeping in, and my passenger was making
grumbling noises about how pointless it was to take over a test car
without knowing how to crank it into action, when a small green light
went on in my head.
SsangYong -- Korean car -- safety measure -- only start with the
clutch out. And there we were, away to the races, shortly before
noticing the red-headlined sticker on the driver's window drawing
attention to that very feature.
The SsangYong is imported by the IM Group of West Bromwich, partly as
a response to its gradual handover of the Isuzu franchise, so that the
group will still have a full-scale 4x4 to sell. The bonus in taking on
SsangYong is that the vehicles come with Mercedes engines. In fact,
Mercedes is a minority shareholder in SsangYong and takes much more than
a casual interest in its well-being.
As well as using Mercedes engines, which gave it instant credibility,
SsangYong commissioned Ken Greenley, the straight-talking Geordie design
consultant who has also done work for Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin and Land
Rover, to look after the body.
Greenley's idea, no doubt contributed to by the overall brief, was to
design a vehicle with a typical 4x4 bottom half and a top half looking
more like an executive estate. As he says: ''Korean traffic jams are
even worse than London's, so all car drivers see of other vehicles is
the top half.''
That may be an odd approach for a car intended to be sold
internationally, but he has come up with a striking looking design whose
passenger cabin is very roomy, as you would expect in a large-scale 4x4.
The body also has a huge amount of luggage space, which similarly sized
4x4s do not always provide.
However, one thing which staggered me about the #17,498 SE version I
was driving was that the luggage compartment, which I stacked up
heartily for a journey to Cork, did not have a security cover. The price
is keen enough for the class of car, but this is surely a case of
spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar. Otherwise, the SE specification
is not skimped, including as it does such details as automatic
door-locking just a few seconds into any journey.
I had seen, in an earlier exercise, that the SsangYong is a proficient
off-roader. While it has a transfer box, this is controlled not by a
separate mini gear lever, but by a rotary switch on the fascia. The
interior as a whole is simple and straightforward, providing a good
driving position and fine all-round visibility.
This particular journey, however, was an opportunity to test
SsangYong's claim that the Musso is intended more as a road vehicle than
as a mud-plugger. Well, it is certainly a relaxed main road cruiser,
although the 2.9-litre Mercedes five-cylinder diesel is over-relaxed in
terms of power output.
It needs 19 seconds to propel the Musso to 60mph, provides a
test-track maximum just over 90mph, and will manage 35mpg at 56mph and
23 at 75, compared with 24mpg around town. On the other hand, it will
probably still be going happily at 300,000 miles.
On UK roads the SsangYong's ride and handling capabilities, the latter
helped by its rack and pinion steering, were fine. Here, it is one of
the most pleasant 4x4s to drive. Once into the heart of Ireland, though,
on a cross-country route by Mullingar and Birr to Cork, it spent almost
the whole time jittering around. But any other 4x4 would have been the
same.

MUCH more thought and money must be devoted by the Government to the
proposed voucher scheme for nursery education before it wins the
acceptance of parents in rural areas.
This is the message being sent by Highland Regional Council to the
Scottish Office, which proposes to offer vouchers worth #1100 to parents
to buy one year of pre-school education for each four-year-old.
Highland joins the growing list of critics of the scheme as at present
proposed. Last week Perth and Kinross refused to have anything to do
with pilot projects for the scheme.
This followed the warning from the Gaelic Pre-School Playgroups
Association, Comhairle Sgoiltean Araich, that the scheme could undermine
the recent progress towards ensuring that Gaelic is still spoken by some
of our children in the 21st century.
Yesterday, Highland's joint sub-committee on education provision for
under eights scrutinised the proposals for the first time and concluded
it was riddled with flaws and would have to be revamped before it could
be introduced.
In particular, there was concern about the viability of setting up
nurseries in rural areas, where numbers do not come anywhere near those
in urban areas; the absence of funding to assist with start-up costs;
the absence of training and inspection costs; and the lack of
recognition of the needs of the Gaelic-speaking community.
There is also concern that the amount of grant allocation received by
the regional council to provide the existing limited nursery education
will be reduced by the introduction of the scheme.
As well as making its views known to the Scottish Office, the regional
council is to liaise on the issue with its successor authority, the
Highland Council, which will be in operation by the time a proposed
pilot scheme is launched.
Education chairman Mrs Valerie MacIver, who had given a cautious
welcome to the proposed scheme when it was announced during the summer,
said yesterday: ''We all want to see improvements in the level of
service to pre-school education and that is why the voucher scheme
appeared, on first glance, to be attractive.
''But close examination of the consultation document has identified a
number of shortcomings, which must be rectified if it is to gain support
from local authorities, nursery education providers, and parents.
''The Government will have to devote much more thought and a lot more
funding to avoid widespread opposition and the disappointment of
thousands of parents, who were led to believe this was a beneficial
scheme which would improve provision of pre-school education.
''Indeed, it is now clear we will lose out on existing, and
unsatisfactory, levels of support for educational services already
provided through the introduction of the scheme.''

A FIFE detective yesterday warned youngsters against ''foolishly''
accepting lifts from strangers after two teenage schoolgirls were
abducted and subjected to a three-hour ordeal.
The two girls from Kirkcaldy were said to be ''very distressed'' by
the incident but not physically injured. Detective Inspector Alan Maich
warned that the attacker may strike again.
The girls' ordeal began at lunchtime on Monday when they missed a bus
home from Glenrothes College where they were on a day release course.
They decided to walk home and were on the Glenrothes to Kinglassie
road when the driver of a blue Ford Fiesta stopped and offered them a
lift.
Instead of taking them home he drove them around the area, which was
unfamiliar to them, then took them to a remote wood near Cardenden where
he assaulted them.
The girls managed to escape from the car and hid in the undergrowth
until the man drove away.
The attacker is described as aged between 22 and 25, 5ft 8in tall,
with short, brown hair. He was wearing a blue denim shirt, cream jeans
and black boots.
Police are appealing for witnesses who saw the girls getting into the
car at the junction of the B921 Coaltown of Balgone/Kinglassie road and
the B922 Kinglassie/Auchmuir Bridge Road.
DI Maich said: ''It seems in this case the girls involved were very
foolish to accept the lift but they now realise that themselves. I would
warn other school pupils not to accept lifts from strangers.''

FORMER SNP leader Gordon Wilson has shown strong support for the
performance of his successor as national convener, in a show of unity
which will strengthen Alex Salmond's hand as delegates gather for their
annual conference in Perth today.
The party enters its 61st annual conference on the back of good
election results and poll standings which are consistently the highest
for a generation, marred only by internal rumblings of dissent.
Mr Wilson's comments are therefore excellent news for the leadership,
which has been dismayed that the party's performance should be
overshadowed by personality clashes and disputes over how to respond to
the growing likelihood of devolution.
Mr Wilson yesterday reaffirmed his support for the long-standing
strategy of refusing to support anything short of full independence,
while accepting that if a devolution scheme was introduced, the SNP
should use that as a further forum to pursue its final aim.
That will disappoint some dissidents on the fundamentalist wing of the
party, recently condemned by Mr Salmond in a nationalist publication as
''over-excited, gullible, and voluble''.
Mr Wilson made a speech recently which was interpreted by Mr Salmond's
opponents as an attack on his leadership, but the former leader said
yesterday this had been misrepresented and he had been trying to offer a
helpful, longer-range perspective, which was difficult for those engaged
in daily political combat.
''It was intended as a thoughtful contribution, and I went out of my
way to praise the leadership of Alex Salmond,'' he said yesterday.
Mr Salmond last night confirmed that many of his predecessor's
suggestions about combining future aspirations with shorter-term
politics had been taken into account in devising the party's strategy.
''Gordon performs a very useful role,'' he said. ''He can do what can
be difficult for those of us engaged in the heat of battle -- look at
the horizon.''
With delegates gathering in Perth City Hall today, scene of the
party's by-election victory earlier this year, victor Ms Roseanna
Cunningham stands against current policy vice-convener Alex Neil in an
internal election this weekend.
* A SNP plea for aid for the North-east of Scotland after recent
serious flooding will be debated in the European Parliament tomorrow. It
follows a successful application for EUUnion aid for the Paisley area
from Labour's Hugh McMahon, Euro-MP for Strathclyde West, earlier this
year.

POOR safety procedures are holding up the sale of a number of the
companies responsible for maintaining railway infrastructure, Labour
claimed yesterday, contradicting Government claims that there are no
problems with privatisation.
Leaked details of a meeting between civil servants and Railtrack,
published by Transport spokesman Henry McLeish, reveal three of seven
Infrastructure Maintenance Units (IMUs) have been unable to produce
satisfactory safety cases, which are essential prerequisites for their
sale.
The IMUs are responsible for civil engineering, electrification,
signalling and other maintenance. The proposed safety procedures of the
three concerned -- all in England: South East, Eastern, and Northern --
have had to be withdrawn as unsatisfactory.
Mr McLeish said: ''Despite the Tories' attempts to say there are no
safety problems with the rail sell-off, behind closed doors public
servants are discussing safety failures.''
The minutes also refer to another unresolved safety concern within the
railways. British Rail's current safety certification will expire at the
end of February next year, and managers are concerned the successor
companies will not have met strict guidelines for safety procedures by
then.
Mr McLeish said: ''These minutes show just how deep the safety crisis
on the railway has become. There must be a serious question on whether
safety is currently up to scratch, as it appears that the IMUs are
trading on the strength of an old BR safety approval and are unable to
make the grade themselves.
''The Tories' plan to sell the IMUs off before the end of the year.
Now they have a choice -- do they admit privatisation is failing or do
they put safety at risk? Either way the sell-off has descended to a
shambles.
''The Transport Secretary, Sir George Young, should immediately state
what his priorities are. He knows that for ordinary people safety has to
remain paramount -- but his silence on this issue is deafening.''

For the first time a public education service will be built and
operated for profit.
THE controversial, Government-backed private finance initiative is to
be extended to the public education service for the first time.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth announced yesterday that private
developers are being sought to build a further education centre in his
Stirling constituency at a cost of between #3m and #4m.
But the main further education lecturers' union, the Educational
Institute of Scotland, expressed concern about public education
institutions being run by the private sector for profit.
Further education sources indicated yesterday that the centre would
probably not have been built if the development had been dependent on
public money because the Scottish Office is reluctant to commit large
amounts of capital to projects in single tranches.
The centre, which will be a joint collaboration between Falkirk and
Clackmannan further education colleges, will offer places for up to 400
students in business, computing, secretarial, health, and social and
leisure studies courses.
The private sector will be invited to tender bids to finance, build,
own, and operate the centre. The winning company will recoup its
investment in rental from the two colleges.
Mr Forsyth said: ''This is a double first -- the first time two
incorporated colleges have sought to collaborate in such a major new
development, and the first time the PFI has been taken this far in a
college building project.''
The EIS further and higher education secretary, Mr Jack Dale, said
last night: ''We would welcome the injection of capital funds to build a
proper FE facility in Stirling because it is the one outstanding town in
Scotland without an FE centre, and the fact that two colleges are
collaborating.
''But we would reserve judgment on the private sector running it.
Private agencies are in it to make money and we are wary about the
profit motive being brought into this public service.
''We would rather see the money coming from the public purse, and
although this seems to be the only way that the centre can be built we
will closely monitor the involvement of profit-making agencies.
''It is also ironic that the Government is encouraging collaboration
when the whole idea behind removing colleges from local government
control was to have them compete against each other and drive themselves
ever upwards.''
Falkirk and Clackmannan colleges announced about a year ago that they
wanted to work together to provide an FE centre for Stirling and, in the
absence of public capital, offered to take part in the PFI.
Dr Graham Clark, the Principal of Falkirk College -- the lead body in
the initiative -- said: ''We believe there is a market opportunity in
Stirling. Market research has indicated that there is potential to
attract students who are not attracted to other colleges in the area.
''We will get additional students, which means more money, and that
partly pays for the building.'' The colleges hope the centre will be
open in time for the academic session that begins in August, 1997.
Falkirk College recently embarked on a cost-cutting exercise because
it was not generating enough income. It resulted in about 40
redundancies, two of which were compulsory.
The vast majority of colleges are free-standing and receive their
funding direct from the Scottish Office. Some are under pressure to
introduce efficiency measures as they come to grips with the
introduction of formula funding.
Dr Clark said Falkirk College was on a secure footing and expected
that unsatisfied student demand in Stirling would offer more
opportunities for the institution and Clackmannan College.
* Meanwhile, Clydebank College will tomorrow become the sixth in the
West of Scotland to sign an agreement with Glasgow and Strathclyde
universities aimed at increasing opportunities for students.
The five Glasgow community colleges have already formed links with the
universities that have led to the development of bridging courses for
students going from FE to higher education.
The initiatives do not go as far as the agreement Glasgow Caledonian
University has reached with three city centre colleges, which stops just
short of merger.

SCOTTISH dentists have started trials on a new laser machine that
could eliminate the need for dental drilling.
The laser treatment, which has no contact with the tooth and makes a
gentle popping noise while any decay is removed, has gone on trial at
Dundee University Dental Hospital. It will reduce the need for
painkilling injections.
Mr Dafydd Evans, senior lecturer in children's dentistry at Dundee
University, explained: ''This is the first of a new generation of dental
lasers which can cut both dentine and enamel. Patients seem to find it
more comfortable than traditional methods.''
The hospital recently installed the latest dental laser at a cost of
#40,000.
It cannot be used where there is a metal filling and the technology is
still too slow to deal with large cavities.
Mr Evans said: ''Reducing patients' worry is an extremely big factor.
There is a lot of evidence that adults who are frightened of visiting a
dentist often have had bad experiences in childhood.
He added: ''Dental lasers could mean a new generation of children may
never have to know the dentist's drill.''

Strasbourg
OPPOSITION Euro-MPs reacted with anger last night after being told
that the British Government supports killing off European Union support
for Gaelic.
Only Ireland stood up for continuation of subsidies for Europe's
lesser used languages, it was disclosed last night, when the Council of
Ministers discussed the subject recently. Britain's representative at
the council was Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, Paymaster General.
This year's budget for EU languages regarded as in need of
safeguarding was #2.64m. The European Parliament wants this sum raised
for 1996 to #2.8m but the Council of Ministers -- the EU's most powerful
institution -- wants it scrapped completely.
A British spokesman said last night: ''All is not quite as it seems.
The council's objection is to the principle involved. There seems to be
no legal base and no treaty base for giving away this money. We think
the money could be spent on other items and better scrutinised to be
sure it is used properly.''
Some of the money -- several hundred thousand pounds -- goes annually
to the United Kingdom and is used to help Gaelic, Scots, Welsh, Cornish
and Irish in Northern Ireland.
Dr Allan Macartney, SNP Euro-MP for North East Scotland, said a cut in
funding would be a ''significant blow'' to the Gaelic community.
He promised to investigate the matter and fight the proposals in the
European Parliament.

Conference report
THE Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow yesterday heard warnings
against Labour domination of any Scottish parliament.
A motion commending the deal struck recently between the leader of the
Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Jim Wallace, and Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson was supported overwhelmingly, but it was
clear from the short debate that there is some grassroots concern.
Ms Elspeth Buchanan, from Glasgow Kelvin, said: ''I find this motion
maybe a little bit self-satisfied and the Convention exercise far from
ideal. By the present exercise, we have come up with a far from ideal
Liberal solution.''
Ms Buchanan, warning of Labour domination of the parliament, said:
''We would have droves of Dennis McSkinners, galaxies of George
Robertsons and phalanxes of Maria Fyfes.
''You could put up a wee budgie in Central Scotland with a rose in its
mouth dancing the tango and it would win, and who is to say the wee
budgie wouldn't be more articulate than some of the punters who get
elected as Labour candidates?''
Mr Derek Young, policy convener of the Scottish Young Liberal
Democrats, also warned of Labour domination.
He said the motion did not go far enough, and added: ''It could have
said Liberal Democrats should force constitutional change and that
Labour cannot be trusted -- although we know that anyway.''
The agreement reached between Mr Wallace and Mr Robertson produced a
joint declaration that they supported a parliament of 129 MPs, to be
elected by a form of proportional representation, breaking what was seen
as a deadlock in discussion of the issue.
In his conference speech, Mr Ashdown went out of his way to emphasise
the importance of constitutional reform, both for Scotland and Wales,
and pay tribute to the efforts of his own team.
He said: ''For 100 years now, this party has supported home rule.
Thanks to the outstanding leadership of Malcolm Bruce and Jim Wallace in
the Scottish Constitutional Convention, Scotland now has a practical
plan for a Scottish parliament, agreed across political parties.
''We are the guarantee that the parliament's powers will not be
diluted. We are the guarantee there will be no backtracking. Thank
goodness Scotland has a Bruce, a Wallace and a Braveheart.
''The one way to ensure that the Scottish separatists win is to deny
the Scottish people their claim of right for a Scottish parliament.''
The motion for yesterday's debate commended the Scottish party on the
progress made in recent weeks within the Scottish Constitutional
Convention towards the final establishment of a scheme for a Scottish
parliament.
However Labour was criticised for its retreat from proposing elected
assemblies for the regions of England and for ''endorsement by the
Labour Party in Wales of unfair, first-past-the-post voting in its
watered down plans for a Welsh Assembly.''
In opening yesterday's debate, Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP Charles
Kennedy surprised some delegates by stating that the deal showed how
parties could co-operate together.
He said: ''It is confirmation of the fact that parties can co-operate
and make common ground without surrendering their respective identities,
far less their keen competitive cutting edges in the political market
place. Ours should be the last party which responds in tribal tones to
anti-tribal overtures.''
Mr Wallace said: ''The party is behind the deal and the important
thing now is to get out there and campaign on it.''
Shadow Secretary of State George Robertson said later: ''I am
delighted that the Liberal Democrats have endorsed, as Labour's Scottish
executive committee did, the joint agreement.
''This is a big signal to the people of Scotland that a Scottish
parliament is on the way, and that political opponents can get together
in the wider interests of the Scottish people.''
Annabel Goldie, deputy chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, said:
''In accepting a proposal for a Scottish assembly which would be stuffed
with unelected party placemen, the Liberals, who claim to be a
democratic, progressive party have really shot themselvesin the foot.
''The Liberal Democrats are desperate to strike a deal with anybody
and, naively unable to stand on their own political merit, are being
inexorably sucked into the New Labour vortex.
''Like a hungry dog, they will pounce on any bone that is thrown at
them. It is therefore hardly surprising that they have backed the
Constitutional Convention's proposals without knowing exactly what these
proposals will be.''

STAFFING levels at private sector nursing homes run in partnership
with Greater Glasgow Health Board have been criticised by Government
monitors.
However, the board defended the staffing levels yesterday, claiming
they were as good as, and in some cases better than, the levels in
equivalent NHS hospitals.
The criticisms were made after a visit to the four homes earlier this
year by the Scottish Health Advisory Service, which called for a review
of the staffing and skill mix, particularly in the homes which cared for
dementia patients.
They are the Rodgerpark and Rowantree Nursing Homes in Rutherglen,
operated by Takare plc; Fourhills Nursing Home in Ruchill, operated by
Westminster Healthcare; Darnley Court Nursing Home, Darnley, operated by
ANS Homes Ltd; and Greenfield Park, Shettleston, operated by St Andrews.
The board's director of planning and contracts, Mr Tom Divers, said it
had reviewed the staffing levels within the homes and held that the
staffing levels set out in the contracts remained appropriate.
These contracts included elements of flexibility to allow staffing to
be increased to match higher levels of dependency at any time.
''A comparison with the staffing levels in NHS continuing care
settings has shown that the staffing complements and skill mixes within
the partnership homes are at least comparable, and in many cases are
higher,'' he said.
''We did find there were periodic difficulties in recruitment of
staff, but we do not accept the SHAS's view that staffing levels are
inadequate.''

IN order to find a cure it is usual, first, to assess the symptoms and
then diagnose the ailment. The radical treatment being offered
yesterday, it was pointed out, might kill rather than cure a patient in
need of no more than a morale massage and a swift injection of cash.
The prescription for a two-tier National Health Service, from a
think-tank financed by drug companies and headed by a former NHS chief
who now sits on the board of a private health insurer, is posited on the
notion that what ails the 50-year-old patient is terminal.
Where is the evidence on which Healthcare 2000 was led to conclude the
NHS cannot meet the demand for treatment into the next century?
It simply does not exist, according to critics who lined up yesterday
to point an accusing finger at what was widely perceived as bad
medicine.
The report claims a widening funding gap can only be closed through
better-off patients paying for extra services or a fast track to
treatment.
Free NHS treatment would be limited to a set of core services. It
calls for the idea of allowing richer patients to pay for first class
treatment, like private hotel-style hospital rooms and a place at the
top of the waiting list, to be examined.
Advances in treatment in an ageing population, it argues, impose
''overwhelming'' pressures on the service which cannot be met from
increases in state funding.
''We are in severe danger here of talking ourselves into a crisis
which does not exist,'' said Philip Hunt, director of the National
Association of Health Authorities and Trusts.
''There is no evidence whatsoever that the NHS can't continue to be
funded out of taxes, so long as it gets year on year growth and
continues to strive for efficiency and effectiveness.
''Their contention is that the requirements for health care are
growing -- and we are asking what's new in that? The NHS is coping, has
always coped, with the growing demand, and the last thing we need is
this sort of alarmist idea that it's on its last legs. It's just
quackery.''
The report claims new sources of funding must be found for the NHS to
straddle the growing gap between demand for healthcare and the resources
available to pay for it.
''While there may be no conclusive evidence that the NHS is presently
underfunded, international comparisons, the explicit rationing of some
health services, and public opinion lead us to conclude there is a gap
between resources and demand which shows signs of increasing as we move
into the next century,'' it states.
Health economist Panos Kamaros, of the London School of Economics,
says the think-tank is wrong to blame an ageing population for absorbing
more health resources:
''The average annual effect of demographic change in the UK has been
quantified at three per cent per annum over the next 35 years. We
shouldn't be blaming the elderly for rising health spending and costs.''
He points out increasingly sophisticated technology and rapid advances
in the care on offer are the most important determinants of health
expenditure.
The report envisigages family doctors and hospitals charging a
supplement to guarantee treatment within a certain period or provide an
appointment outside normal hours:
''Most health care systems try to guarantee equity of access. This
seems to recommend the reverse. What we should be doing is keeping
access as it is and focussing more on efficiencies and the delivery of
health care.''
The proportion of national wealth spent on health in the UK remains
way below that of other Eureopean countries, he says, and remains far
behind that spent in the US and Japan.
The UK, spending 7.1% of its gross domestic product on health, ranks
behind France (9.8%), Germany (8.6%), Italy (8.5%), the Netherlands
(8.7%), Sweden (7.5%), the US (14.1%), and Japan (7.3%).
Mr Sam Galbraith, a Labour politician who has been on both sides of
the hospital bedsheets, as a neurosurgeon and a transplant patient,
insists the committee has compiled a report based on a set of
misconceptions.
He said: ''Let's start with the fundamentals. They don't distinguish
between demand and need. The two are entirely different. There is
unlimited demand but not unlimited need.''
Put at its simplest, patients may go to their GPs asking for
antibiotics to treat an upper respiratory track infection: ''There is a
great demand, but no need for them because they don't work for such
infections which are caused by viruses.
''When you concentrate on need, as opposed to demand, it is easier to
work out a prescription.''
The report also concludes rationing of services is inevitable, citing
a Salford health authority which ranked treatments according to
effectiveness. Mr Galbraith says again the definition of rationing is
confused and questionable.
''Stopping unnecessary treatments is not rationing,'' he said. ''For
instance, you may not give a lot of expensive treatments for tumours and
leukemias, not because you are rationing but because you don't believe
it to be in the patient's best interests.
''Rationing is the denial of treatment that is of benefit to me, that
I want and the doctor wants to give me. Nothing else is rationing, and
we are not remotely close to requiring rationing in the NHS.
''What this report is proposing is treatment based on ability to pay,
not need.
''It goes against everything the NHS stands for. We are not even close
to having to consider this, and there are a whole host of things that
could be done to make savings while improving patient care.''
Such as? More rigorous controls on treatments of dubious value, Mr
Galbraith says, and an end to the enormous bureuacracy caused by the
internal markets. Administrative costs within the NHS have jumped from
five to 10%: ''Once you eliminate the market system, and the necessity
for contracts there are savings to be made.''
The NHS has been able to absorb massive increased demands on it
through the improvements in medical technology and treatments.
''We don't have massive TB sanitoriums any more. People don't lie flat
on their backs for six weeks after a heart attack. People are generally
healthier.''
Dr Mac Armstrong, Secretary of the British Medical Association, said
it was no surprise the think-tank had reached the conclusions it had.
''It's perhaps unfair to expect them to have reached any other
conclusions. You have to put it in context and understand what
Healthcare 2000 is -- it is a think-tank funded by the pharmaceutical
industry and headed by Sir Duncan Nichol who left the NHS who become a
director of BUPA which provides private medical services.
''They have made an analysis of the problem and their analysis isn't
the same as ours.
''I don't blame them for that. You have to see where they are coming
from to understand the conclusions they have reached.''

Hamilton
BERMUDA today became the latest island paradise to prepare for
Hurricane Marilyn as the storm, which caused severe damage in the
Caribbean, was forecast to pass near the British colony.
Forecasters said Marilyn would be west of the islands later tonight
and island residents were told to prepare themselves, their homes, and
possessions for severe weather.
''Marilyn will pass within 150 miles of Bermuda late this evening or
tonight, bringing winds of up to 60mph and thunderstorms and storm
surges,'' said Bermuda Weather Service forecaster George Parks.
Marilyn killed at least eight people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands last week.
Bermuda suffered a similar buffeting when Hurricane Luis came close 10
days ago.
In what has been one of the busiest hurricane seasons in decades, the
colony also was brushed by Hurricane Felix last month, causing an
estimated #1.6m in damage and forcing a day's delay in an independence
referendum.--Reuter.

SCOTTISH dentists have started trials on a new laser machine that
could eliminate the need for dental drilling.
The laser treatment, which has no contact with the tooth and makes a
gentle popping noise while any decay is removed, has gone on trial at
Dundee University Dental Hospital. It will reduce the need for
painkilling injections.
Mr Dafydd Evans, senior lecturer in children's dentistry at Dundee
University, explained: ''This is the first of a new generation of dental
lasers which can cut both dentine and enamel. Patients seem to find it
more comfortable than traditional methods.''
The hospital recently installed the latest dental laser at a cost of
#40,000.
It cannot be used where there is a metal filling and the technology is
still too slow to deal with large cavities.
Mr Evans said: ''Reducing patients' worry is an extremely big factor.
There is a lot of evidence that adults who are frightened of visiting a
dentist often have had bad experiences in childhood.
He added: ''Dental lasers could mean a new generation of children may
never have to know the dentist's drill.''

IT'S time for the consultant's morning round in the heart ward of a
top London hospital and the first vital piece of data he wants from his
patients is their postcode.
It's not part of some arcane research project aimed at determining
whether the citizens of Shoreditch are more prone to heart attacks than
the people of Brixton.
They are being asked for postcodes to determine if their treatment
will be paid for, it was claimed yesterday.
The questions are being posed in a London teaching hospital which
takes referrals from several different health authorities and from
fund-holding GPs, said Professor Harry Keen, a specialist in human
metabolism and chairman of the NHS Support Federation.
Professor Keen was one of a wide range of people, including Health
Secretary Stephen Dorrell, who sought to repudiate the views expressed
by Sir Duncan Nichol and other members of Healthcare 2000, a think-tank
sponsored by the drugs industry.
''A colleague of mine told me today he had done one of his first ward
rounds in a London hospital yesterday, and the first question the
cardiologist had asked his patients was what was their postcode,'' he
said.
''They had run out of money for some of the post codes, and would be
unable to continue until they got more money.
''These are postcodes within health authority areas whose contracts
have run out. What is astonishing people who live around the hospital is
that they can't get treatment while people from miles away, or who have
fund-holding GPs, can.''
Although it was unclear what was to happen to people with the
''wrong'' postcode, Professor Keen said: ''I was assured that was the
first question that was asked -- not 'How are we this morning?' or
anything like that -- because some distinction had to be made between
those from health authorities whose contracts had run out and those
whose contracts were still running.
''This is transactional medicine -- it smacks of the patients in
America who are asked for their health insurance number as soon as they
are admitted.''
The splitting of patients into haves and have-nots was evidence of the
fraudulence of ''money following patients.'' In fact, he said, patients
followed contracts.
Equally fraudulent was the the idea supported by Sir Duncan and his
colleagues that the NHS could not go on providing free health care and
that most of it should be paid for privately.
The Healthcare 2000 report argues that the NHS cannot continue to be
funded by taxation alone into the next century as demand outstrips
resources, and concludes that the widening funding gap can only be
effectively closed through patients being charged for certain services.
The report says the idea of letting patients pay for first class
treatment, like private hotel-style hospital rooms and a place at the
top of the waiting list, should be examined.
It calls for a ''more plurastic mix'' of public, private, and
voluntary healthcare to raise the quality of health services and bring
benefits of innovation and enterprise.
Professor Keen said: ''This has the seduction of making people of
reasonable goodwill think that by going private they are helping the
NHS. In fact, those who buy their care will get the best off the stall
and what is left will go to the rest.''
What was now happening, Professor Keen said, was that in the past
people in the middle-ranks relied on the NHS because, although they
always knew that there would be no frills or luxuries, they would get
good quality care.
''It is precisely that confidence that has been eroded in the past few
years. They feel they might as well have the extra assuranxe of private
care, in the belief they will be leaving their place in the NHS waiting
list to someone else.
''But the person who treats them will be exactly the same person who
would have treated them on the NHS. They are using their leverage as
paying customers to order up what they want, when they want, and
doctors, being human too, are attracted by the lure of private practice
and increased income. The private sector is cutting very nasty holes in
the NHS.''
Professor Keen dismisses the ''bottomless pit'' argument which he says
is used to erode the idea of a free NHS.
''They are trying to make out that spending another penny means
throwing ourselves into the abyss.
''Here are people who are ideologically inimical to the idea of the
NHS, and are disconcerted by the fact that here is something that has
been working well and does not fit in with their pusillanimous
philosophy.''
According to figures from the Office of Health Economics, the total
cost of the NHS, which accounts for 85% of the UK's health spending, was
expected to reach a record #41bn by the end of this year. That is
equivalent to #709 for every member of the population.
Total health care costs, public and private, take up 6.7% of the Gross
Domestic Product, an increase of nearly 50% since 1970. Yet the UK
continues to lag behind major industrialised countries, most of whom
devote between 8%-10% to health.

With opinion polls showing a virtual dead heat ahead of Quebec's
referendum on sovereignty, Ottawa says it will accept whatever decision
is made. However as DAVID NORTH reports, the advocates of change have
the momentum
IT WAS only a 30-second sound bite, but Canadian Cabinet Minister
Lucienne Robillard's remark that Ottawa would accept the result of next
month's referendum on Quebec sovereignty sent shivers of apprehension
down federalist spines.
For the first time a senior member of Prime Minister Jean Chretien's
Liberal government had recognised by implication that the province might
opt to break away, ending a 200-year partnership.
The statement was all the more alarming because Robillard is
Chretien's designated hitter on the sovereignty issue and because it
came just days after an opinion poll showed the separatists ahead for
the first time.
The poll gave the Yeas in the October 30 referendum campaign only a
fractional lead -- 50.2% to 49.8% for the Nos, virtually a dead heat
given that there was a three-point margin of error. However its author
Jean-Marc Leger, noting that the Yeas had gained five points in a matter
of months, warned that it was time for the rest of Canada to ''wake
up''. The separatists had the momentum, he said, if only because it was
they who were advocating change.
The catalyst for this remarkable turnaround appears to have been the
creation of a common front between Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois and
its federal partners, the Bloc Quebecois with the upstart Parti de
l'Action Democratique last June. Up to that point, the PQ and the Bloc
had been making no headway among voters with their outright
pro-sovereignty message. But in forging a new partnership, PQ Premier
Jacques Parizeau and the Bloc's Lucien Bouchard took the chance to
modify their appeal to voters. Taking a leaf from the PAD's policy book,
they pledged to attempt to negotiate political and economic ties with
Canada after separation.
It was a shrewd move, given Quebeckers' taste for radical change, and
it also brought aboard the boy wonder of Quebec politics, Mario Dumont,
who, at the ripe old age of 24, last year won election to the National
Assembly as the PAD's sole representative. Led by Dumont, known in some
circles as Super Mario, the PAD managed to secure a respectable 10% of
the vote, many of them people who don't mind the idea of sovereignty
provided that it doesn't spell divorce.
The separatists have been plugging this line for all its worth. They
say that Quebeckers will be able to keep their Canadian passports,
continue to use Canadian dollars, and that everything from defence to
trade and transport will be negotiable afterwards, although Parizeau has
made it clear that a yes vote will ''result in a country''.
The No response has been, as Leger implied, less than overwhelming.
Canadians in general are bored with the whole subject after living on
the constitutional edge since the PQ's abortive 1980 referendum. The
politicians, too, seem jaded.
Sundry premiers from the rest of Canada have intimated that a yes vote
will not mean business as usual. However Bouchard was quick to point out
that it would be out of character for Toronto wheelers and dealers,
however irked they might be by a yes vote, to allow politics to get in
the way of profits.
In an attempt to gloss over what appears to be a marked absence of
strategic thinking, No strategists recently leaked the existence of a
''war room'' in Ottawa, where events and news reports are monitored.
The most important shoe, however, has yet to drop -- the one that
belongs to Jean Chretien. So far he has played it as cool as an Indian
summer. There's no reason for Quebeckers to separate, he maintains,
because Canada offers everything they could possibly want. ''I'm not
losing any sleep,'' he told people watching a canoe race at La Tuque,
Quebec. ''I'm very confident.''
It is a typical approach and one that has served him well in crises as
diverse as the fate of Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia and the current
orgy of deficit-cutting, with all that implies for the country's fraying
social fabric. But he might have to change his tactics if the Yes side
continues to gain ground.
In the end, however, the issue may be decided by factors outside the
politicians' control. There's a saying in Quebec that the descendants of
the original Norman settlers, a notably cautious breed, ''like to wear
braces and a belt at the same time''.
Moreover, as four Quebec professors noted in a recent essay, 30 years
of social change have largely banished traditional Francophone fears
that their distinctive culture is threatened.
A new generation of Francophone businessmen now dominates the economic
scene and the old Catholic-Protestant divide has all but disappeared as
the society has become more secular. Many Quebeckers, the academics
argue, do not feel they are sufficiently different from other Canadians
to demand a country of their own.
Finally, there is the ballot-box factor. In several recent Quebec
elections, most notably the 1993 federal and 1994 provincial campaigns,
the actual vote for parties advocating separatism has been several
percentage points fewer than the polls predicted, a phenomenon that may
be explained by the fact that Yes voters appear somewhat softer in their
convictions than the Nos. Currently, almost one-quarter say they might
change their minds.
Still, by any reckoning it's a very open race and the stakes are
uncomfortably high. An independent Quebec would drive a wedge right
through the country, separating it into eastern and western halves.
''Can you give me one example of a country divided in two which was
able to survive?'' demanded former Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, a
federalist, during a recent brush with reporters. Nobody was foolish
enough to reply.

THE National Health Service swept into existence in 1948 on a wave of
post-war idealistic fervour.
Its founding values were written into the legislation that gave it
birth: ''The establishment . . . of a comprehensive health service free
at the point of delivery, designed to secure improvement in the physical
and mental health . . .''
For many, those fundamental principles remain as sacrosanct as the
United States' constitution is to the majority of American citizens.
But there is an enormous price to pay for such lofty ideals.
According to figures from the Office of Health Economics research
group, the total cost of the NHS, which accounts for 85% of the UK's
health spending, was expected to reach a record #41 billion by the end
of this year. That is equivalent to #709 for every member of the
population.
Total health care costs, public and private, take up 6.7% of the Gross
Domestic Product -- an increase of nearly 50% since 1970.
Yet the UK continues to lag behind major industrialised countries,
most of whom devote between 8% and 10% to health.
Despite health insurance membership expanding almost four-fold since
1970, the amount spent on private health care in the UK, about #2.5
billion a year, is relatively small compared with other European
countries.
The figures translate into a looming crisis as medical advances, an
ageing population, and greater demands and expectations from the public,
pile pressure on resources.
One of the biggest challenges to the health service arises from what
has been called the ''demographic time bomb''.
There are 9.2 million people aged 65 years and over living in the UK
today, or 16% of the population, and 900,000 people aged over 85.
Before the middle of the next century these figures are expected to
increase to about 15 million and three million respectively.
This will result in a huge drain on the health service. Health care
costs an estimated #848 per head for the elderly, and #1,637 for the
very elderly, compared with #307 for every person of working age.
Advances in surgery, treatment, and information technology are another
source of greater demands on the health service.
It is estimated that up to 70% of operations could be performed by
minimally invasive techniques within the next 10 years. This will mean
more surgery taking place on an out-patient and day-patient basis.
While this may result in savings in terms of reduced hospital
treatment times, they could be off-set by increased use of operating
theatre resources and the necessity for follow-up care.
Previously untreatable chronic conditions -- ulcers, multiple
sclerosis, strokes, migraine and epilepsy -- are now being tackled with
new drugs.
But every new treatment incurs an extra cost.
Computing and information technology will bring more clinical
knowledge to patients.
People with access to databases and networks will gain an increasingly
greater understanding of medical advances, and their expectations of
higher standards of treatment will rise accordingly.

Wellington, Tuesday
NEW Zealand has revoked the residency permit of a British man recently
questioned about the 1992 London murder of Rachel Nickell.
''The immigration service has forwarded to me its report on John
Gallagher and after consideration of the case I have decided to revoke
Mr Gallagher's residence permit,'' Immigration Minister Roger Maxwell
said today.
He was asked whether the questioning of Mr Gallagher by Scotland Yard
detectives over the murder had anything to do with the decision to
revoke his permission to live in New Zealand.
''There's no connection as far as I'm concerned,'' Mr Maxwell replied.
''It's purely on the fact that he did not declare past convictions which
obviously affected the assessment of his character.
''The range and nature of the convictions was such that, in my view,
he wouldn't have got past first base as far as getting approval for any
permit in New Zealand,'' Mr Maxwell added.
''Mr Gallagher's permanent residence permit was obtained by concealing
relevant information regarding criminal activities in Britain, which
would have made him ineligible for a permit under the Immigration Act,''
said Mr Maxwell.
He declined to say what criminal activities Mr Gallagher had
concealed.
Mr Gallagher has 21 days to appeal against the decision or leave New
Zealand voluntarily.
Scotland Yard detectives, following a new lead in the unsolved murder
of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common, flew to New Zealand last month to
interview Mr Gallagher.
Ms Nickell, 23, was sexually assaulted and stabbed nearly 50 times in
broad daylight in front of her two-year-old son Alex.
In London, a Scotland Yard spokesman said: ''Our inquiries in the
Rachel Nickell case are not complete. We do not name those we question
and we reserve the right to question who we want.''
Mr Gallagher arrived in New Zealand in 1993 and has been living with
his girlfriend in the North Island town of Hastings.-- Reuter.

Strasbourg
PAULINE Green, leader of the European Parliament's powerful socialist
group, yesterday committed Labour to opposing French President Jacques
Chirac's proposed European nuclear umbrella.
She also supported moves by the parliament to force the European
Commission to sue the French Government in the European Court of Justice
in a bid to have nuclear testing stopped.
During a day when the worldwide storm of protest at Mr Chirac's
defiant stand came to the French town of Strasbourg, seat of the
assembly, Mrs Green condemned French action as ''arrogance and
colonialism.''
She came close to embracing nuclear disarmament when she told
Euro-MPs: ''We want nothing to do with a Europe of nuclear weapons.''
Groups of South Sea islanders in traditional dress sang songs and took
part in a demonstration outside the assembly. Euro-MPs fixed photographs
of themselves to a symbolic mushroom emitting a smoke cloud which
threatened to choke onlookers.
Mrs Green accused Mr Chirac of hypocrisy but was herself branded a
hypocrite by the SNP who claimed Labour would base the Trident nuclear
force on the Clyde because it was far from London.
SNP president Mrs Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands) challenged
Labour to do away with Trident. Later, Mrs Green refused to discuss
Trident.
Her forceful speech appeared to take aback even her own party members
as she accused Mr Chirac of ''doing more damage to European integration
than anyone else in Europe today''.
She said: ''In the run-up to the first test -- despite protests --
Chirac and his Ministers declared this was a French domestic decision on
which the EU had no right to comment. After the first test, under stress
and pressure from around the world, Chirac announced that he was
carrying out the tests for Europe. My group utterly rejects such
hypocrisy.''
She added: ''I want to make it clear now that my group will have no
part of any attempt to persuade the European Union that what it needs is
a European nuclear umbrella. Over the past few weeks the view has gained
ground that the development of Europe's foreign and security policy will
involve the British and French nuclear capacity.
''I believe this has been a purely opportunistic attempt to draw
Europe into sympathy and complicity with Mr Chirac's resumption of
nuclear testing.''
Euro-MPs, who will vote today on the issue, reacted with anger to a
claim by European Commission president Jacques Santer that it was too
soon to say if the commission could block the tests in the European
Court.
Under Article 34 of the Euratom treaty the commission can block
experiments affecting EU territory and people if they are held to be
''particularly dangerous''.
But Mr Santer told the assembly, to the fury of many members: ''At
this stage we still cannot decide if Article 34 applies. We have to form
an opinion on the basis of information received.''
He said that so far there was not enough information but that a
commission team of investigators was now collecting evidence of the
tests' effects in the South Pacific.
Mrs Green said most Euro-MPs backed a popular majority in France,
Europe and the South Pacific that the tests should be stopped now.
Muted hostility to the tests came from the European Peoples' Party
which includes British Conservatives.
Tory Group chairman Mr Tom Spencer called for the replacement of tests
by scientific simulation methods.
French Euro-MP Helene Carrere d'Encausse from France's ruling Rally
for the Republic party, denied the French government was arrogant.
''It's not a matter of arrogance or of pride. We need to be ready to
defend ourselves and our allies at all times,'' she argued.
Meanwhile, eight Nobel laureates called for an independent scientific
study on the impact of the nuclear tests on the South Pacific
environment.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and US economist J K Galbraith were among the
signatories to the statement calling on the French Government to halt
the tests pending such an investigation.

<HEADLINE>Union ballot 'too old to be a valid test of opinions'. Post Office court bid to block strike</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROY ROGERS INDUSTRIAL CORRESPONDENT</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE Post Office will today take legal action to try to block a planned
strike by some counter staff, claiming the union ballot was too old.
The action, set for Friday, is part of a long-running dispute over the
closure of Crown Post Offices, and includes many workers in Glasgow.
The PO will seek injunctions in the High Court and the Edinburgh Court
of Session, arguing that the ballot conducted by the Communications
Workers Union on industrial action is no longer valid, having been held
10 months ago.
''We think it is too old to be a valid test of union members'
opinions,'' said a Post Office Counters spokeswoman. ''We do not want to
seek this injunction but we want to protect services for our customers.
''We do not think the union has a mandate to call this strike based on
a 10-month-old ballot.''
A writ has been served on the union, which has called out its members
in Strathclyde, London, Liverpool, and Northern Ireland in a third round
of one-day strikes in protest at the closure of town centre POs and the
increasing franchising arrangements with supermarkets and other retail
chains.
The union's joint general secretary, Mr Alan Johnson, said the court
action was a ''desperate'' response to its campaign against this
''back-door privatisation''.
''Every time we take action PO Counters is forced to explain their
closure programme to a public which is heartily sick and tired of seeing
excellent town centre post offices shoved into the back of newsagents,
supermarkets, and hardware stores.''
The union has already staged two one-day strikes, in December and
March, and on each occasion the PO claimed disruption had been minimal
with few offices affected.
In another industrial dispute, court moves by London Underground have
forced the Rail, Maritime, and Transport Union to call off a 48-hour
stoppage over pay which was due to begin from noon today.
The RMT is to hold a fresh ballot for action among its Underground
members over the long-running dispute, and forecasts solid support for
stoppages throughout the winter.
The court order awarded to London Underground had barred new RMT
recruits from taking part in today's planned walkout.
General secretary Jimmy Knapp said: ''This is London Underground's
second cynical use of the courts. It can only serve to prolong this
dispute and I'm sure it will have hardened the attitude of our
members.''

IN the brave new world of computerised health care, Big Brother will
be watching you. Far from the Orwellian nightmare of intrusion and
repression, however, electronic ''eyes'' are being adapted for the more
benign role of detecting health problems in elderly people living alone.
One system, being developed in Australia with support from British
Telecom, is called Remote Monitoring Telemedicine (RMT). Its design is
regarded as revolutionary in that it surveys the space in which a person
lives rather than the individual. Instead of checking a person's
temperature or blood pressure, it monitors the individual's daily
routine and alerts medical supervisors if there is a significant change
that might indicate illness.
It comprises a network of sensors that sends a constant stream of data
about movement, cooking, and sleep patterns, to a computer in the home,
which relays it automatically by modem to a community health centre or
hospital for analysis.
For example, if infra-red motion detectors, and pressure pads beneath
the carpet, signal a prolonged lack of movement, the central computer
would warn health workers that the person might have collapsed.
Providing the system is acceptable to the public and the NHS, BT hopes
to be able to market various models by the turn of the century for less
than #1000.
Brian Davies, the BT project manager in Ipswich, admits there is
something ''Big Brotherish'' about the concept but says that elderly
people and health workers who have been consulted in a pilot study in
Sydney have been broadly supportive. Privacy and data security will be
ensured by passwords, encryption, and controlled access.
''The idea is to help elderly people maintain their independence and
quality of life in their own homes, and at the same time to take some
pressure off the health services,'' Davies says.
He adds that any RMT set-up could be programmed to switch off a cooker
that had been left on, or a bath that had been left running.
A similar scheme is being developed in Norway to make life at home
easier for dementia sufferers. The Lillehammer ''smart house'' fits the
needs of a particular person and can help restore some of their
independence.
It can combat memory loss so if the householder opens the door to go
out without closing windows, a light comes to warn them while a central
computer, acts as a personal reminder of a cooker or iron left on.
Professor Mary Marshall of the Dementia Services Development Centre at
Stirling University said: ''I was very sceptical about the use of
computers for dementia sufferers until I met a woman in Scotland with
dementia who played computer games every day to activate her brain. And
I know of at least two people with dementia who have been able to write
books, both about their experience of Alzheimer's Disease, by using a
word processor.''
While firm in the belief that well-used technology could be an
enormous boost to dementia sufferers, Professor Marshall is adamant that
it is not a substitute for good design. The use of glass doors for rooms
and cupboards can help prevent disorientation or memory lapse about what
is stacked on shelves.
Linking a human face to the wonders of technology is a vital
consideration for health workers.
Dr William Clayton, a lecturer at the Royal Free Hospital school of
medicine in London, believes the RMT system could make efficient care
and support of the elderly more widely available. Dr Clayton is involved
in a similar research project -- medical teleconsulting -- in which GPs
and their patients confer with a specialist who appears on a video
screen.
''The idea is that a consultant is kind of beamed into a GP's surgery
while the patient is present, and we have found that people relate well
to seeing a friendly face on the screen.
''Following on from that, RMT seems a fairly obvious application of
this technology. Computers are fine, but the human follow-up is vital.''
When RMT does become available early next century, its manufacturers
might wish to find a more user-friendly name for it. ''Big Brother''
would hardly encourage sales -- given its nursing connotations, perhaps
''Big Sister'' might be more appropriate.

BRITISH schoolteacher Gillian Llewellyn found dead in the Chinese
beauty spot of Guilin was murdered, police said last night.
The body of 35-year-old Miss Llewellyn, who had been missing since the
end of last month, was discovered last week.
A spokesman for Norfolk police said the information had been received
from Interpol confirming that the woman, who came from Norwich, had been
murdered.
Local police launched an investigation after the discovery of her body
in the popular Chinese tourist area.
She was last seen alive on August 30 when she left her hotel in Guilin
on her way to Hong Kong.
Miss Llewellyn was due to return to her job as a geography teacher at
the start of term at the Hewitt School, Norwich.
The alarm was raised after colleagues contacted her parents at their
Swansea home when they learned she had failed to make her flight
connection from Shanghai to Hong Kong.
Police and Interpol were immediately alerted and an intensive
international search was launched.
However, there was no trace of her until the Public Security Bureau
told British officials that a woman's body had been discovered in the
Guilin area.
Miss Llewellyn did not speak any Chinese, but was an experienced
trekker who had walked through Peru and Burma on solo trips before.
She lived alone and spent all her annual holidays travelling around
the world.

FOR those who can afford it, there is a solution to the retirement
blues -- in fact there is a dazzling variety of them. How about a week
in an elephant orphanage in Sri Lanka, or an excursion to the Waitomo
Glow Worm Cave in New Zealand, for example?
If there is a crisis in long-term care for the elderly, somebody has
forgotten to mention it to millions of British pensioners who are
spending more money than ever on flying and cruising to exotic
destinations. Companies specialising in holidays for senior citizens
report an increasing demand for more expensive packages to far-flung
places.
Market analysts say there is an element of: ''We've worked hard all
our lives for this money, the children don't need it, so let's have fun
with it and let the state look after us later.''
Martin Smith, marketing director of Saga Holidays, agrees this
attitude is probably a factor in a significant swing from short, cheap
breaks to grander and more adventurous travelling.
''I see it with my own in-laws,'' he says. ''They've earned every
penny of their savings, they've paid tax on it already, and they don't
see why they should have to give it to the Government for health care
when they've been paying national insurance all the while.
''What we're seeing now in the older generation holiday market is a
very clear shift to exotic destinations, and also a trend towards two or
more holidays a year instead of one. There is a spirit of adventure
coming through.''
Tour operators have had to respond to another sociological shift --
the growing numbers of people taking early retirement. In the past year
Saga has lowered its target clientele from the over 60s to over 50s.
''This new generation of older folk is more demanding, and we are
continually having to upgrade our services. They may be more willing to
spend their nest-eggs, but they are insisting on higher qualities of
service in return, which is fair enough,'' Smith says.
The emerging philosophy of ''spend it while you can'' is reflected in
Saga's range of holiday brochures. Those who fancy a week of sequence
dancing in Eastbourne are still catered for, but more intrepid
travellers are invited to embark on train journeys through the sacred
valley of the Incas in Peru, and cruises to the Holy Land in the company
of classical musicians hosted by Richard (Last Night of the Proms)
Baker.
For those who cannot afford such luxuries, an advertisement in a
recent issue of Saga's magazine offers a flavour of exotic travel at a
more modest price. For #9.95 (plus P&amp;P) one may acquire a red, yellow,
and green model talking ''I repeat anything you say'' parrot. A deluxe
model (with a swinging perch) costs #3 more. It may be tacky, but it
must be more amusing than worrying about paying for geriatric care.

Srinagar
INDIAN forces have been ordered to stay away from a mountainous area
where Kashmir separatists are holding Britons Keith Mangan and Paul
Wells and two other Westerners hostage.
The Al-Faran militants had claimed last night that commandos attacked
one of their hideouts in the Himalayas, causing casualties. They would
not say whether any of the hostages were injured.
It was not the first time Al-Faran has claimed army attacks on its
hideouts since the standoff began in early July.
Today Government spokesman Kulbhushan Jandial denied that any clash
had taken place. He also said that a negotiator who spoke with an
Al-Faran representative, three hours after the reported gun battle,
indicated the hostages were safe.
''To avoid any misunderstanding, we have asked our troops to stay away
from the area where we believe the hostages are being held,'' Mr Jandial
said in an interview in Srinagar.
In another development, officials close to the negotiations said that
India has offered rebels almost #800,000 to release the captives. One
official said, on condition of anonymity, that the two sides are
discussing the offer.
Al-Faran has repeatedly threatened to kill its captives if the
Government does not release 15 jailed guerrillas. So far it has refused
and the rebels have responded by killing a Norwegian hostage.--AP.

<TEXT>
A FATHER told a fatal accident inquiry that he was visiting a
neighbour when he first heard that his 11-year-old son had been injured.
Mr William Brotherston, 54, told fiscal Mr Will Andrew, that his young
daughter had run up screaming that there had been an accident and his
son Gary had been hurt.
The boy later died in hospital from his injuries after falling under
the wheels of a dumper truck on a building site only 200 yards from his
home at Kirn Road, Kilmarnock.
Mr Brotherston said: ''He used to go to the site on his way home from
school to collect ginger bottles.''
He added that workmen on the site had said to his son: ''Gary -- go
home and get your dinner and come back when the machinery is off the
site.''
Mr William Gamble, of Croftfoot Road, Kilmarnock, who was working on
the site at Campbeltown Drive, told Sheriff Thomas Croan that there was
a problem of boys entering it.
He said at first the site was fenced to keep unwanted visitors out.
But occupied houses in Dunoon Avenue made it impossible to seal off.
On the day of the accident some boys climbed on to the dumper and were
seen playing with the steering wheel.
Mr Gamble said: ''Gary was with them. I couldn't say if he was on the
dumper.''
Eventually the boys appeared to move elsewhere after they were chased
off.
But Mr Gamble said later he heard the dumper start up and some boys
ran past him, being chased by two of the workmen.
Samuel Agnew, of Campbeltown Drive, Kilmarnock, now a pupil at
Geilsland School, Beith, told Mr Andrew he sat on the driving seat and
in the skip of the dumper. He said he didn't know how often he was told
to move off by workmen.
He said he did not think the driver meant to move the dumper, but it
jumped forward and the rear wheel went over Gary.
He added that the driver had spent five minutes persuading the boys to
get off the dumper. He said he saw Gary trying to get a bottle which was
sitting on the truck. It was on the truck when it moved away.
Mr Alexander Armstrong, 55, a plasterer of McBeth Drive, Kilmarnock,
said Gary was a frequent visitor to the site where he came to collect
ginger bottles.
He said the driver looked round to left and right to see if there were
kids there, but Gary lost his footing and fell under the rear wheel.
The driver of the dumper truck on the day of the accident, Mr Damien
O'Donnell, 20, said he was taught to drive a dump truck in four or five
days on a previous site, and given further training at Kilmarnock. He
said he held no certificate of competence to drive dump trucks.
Consultant pathologist Dr Nancy Cunningham, 54, carried out a post
mortem on the dead youngster. She said she found injuries on the head,
chest and leg. The boy had sustained multiple injuries including a
fractured skull.
The sheriff returned a formal verdict.

Paris, Tuesday
FRANCE will try in their absence four Libyans, including Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi's brother-in-law, in connection with the bombing of a
French airliner that killed 171 people.
Mr Francis Szpiner, a lawyer for the victims, said, after meeting the
magistrate who heads the investigation into the 1989 bombing of UTA
flight 772 over Niger, that the trial was expected to start in October
1996 before a Paris criminal court.
Mr Szpiner was joined by relatives of those killed in the bombing at
his meeting with Mr Jean-Louis Bruguiere, France's top anti-terrorist
judge. The meeting took place on the disaster's sixth anniversary.
''It was important for the victims to see that the judge continues to
work on the case, to explain why things seem to be taking so long,'' Mr
Szpiner said. ''They now have the feeling that justice will be done.''
Among the four suspects, named in international arrest warrants but
whom Libya refuses to turn over to French justice, is Abdallah Senoussi,
Gaddafi's brother-in-law.
The others have been identified as Abdallah Elazragh, a diplomat
working in Brazzaville at the time, and alleged secret agents Ibrahim
Naeli and Musbah Arbas.
The United Nations Security Council has imposed economic sanctions on
Libya over its refusal to turn over suspects in two airline bombings,
the 1989 UTA blast over Niger and the 1988 explosion of PanAm flight 103
over Lockerbie.
* Police detained about 30 people suspected of links to Algerian
Muslim extremists in Marseilles in early morning raids today, prompted
by a wave of bomb attacks in France. All but five were later released.
Those held were suspected of being close to Islamic fundamentalists
fighting to overthrow Algeria's military rulers, but none was believed
directly linked to the bombings in the Paris and Lyon regions.--Reuter.

CUSTOMERS could be handed back a share of the excess profits reaped by
privatised utilities under proposals being considered by Labour, Shadow
Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham said yesterday.
The method being considered would replace price caps as a way of
maintaining an element of free market pricing. But profits above a level
set by the regulator would be shared between the utility and its
customers through automatic rebates or price cuts.
Speaking at a conference in London, Dr Cunningham said: ''The current
spate of takeover bids among the privatised utilities -- hostile or
agreed -- underlines the need not only for debate about the future of
our gas, water and electricity industries, but for firm positive
action,'' he said.
''It is time to take a long, hard look at the utilities at this
pivotal point in time.''
He accepted the need for incentives to allow management to pursue
innovation and efficiency, and for profit for dividends for share
holders.

THE Prime Minister yesterday sought to kick-start the Northern Ireland
peace process at a prolonged meeting at No. 10 with the new Ulster
Unionist leader Mr David Trimble.
On Friday Mr Major meets Irish Premier John Bruton at an informal EU
summit in Majorca to repair the damage caused by Dublin's cancellation
of a summit meeting a fortnight ago.
Yesterday the Prime Minister gave Mr Trimble the reassurance that he
needed: that the British Government will not soften its stance on the
handover of IRA weapons.
Furthermore Mr Major was able to report to Mr Trimble that President
Clinton is also disappointed at the failure of Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams to deliver the IRA on the decommissioning of its offensive weapons
-- thought to range from semtex explosives and mortars to ground-to-air
missiles.
Afterwards No. 10 was said to be encouraged by the one hour and 14
minute meeting between the Prime Minster and Mr Trimble, who now
commands the majority of Ulster Unionist opinion.
Of prime importance to Mr Major, in view of his Commons majority, is
establishing a personal relationship of trust with Mr Trimble, such as
he had with Mr Jim Molyneaux.
After Mr Major's talks with Mr Bruton at the informal EU summit on
Friday, Mr Major intends another effort to put the peace process in
Northern Ireland back on schedule.
On Tuesday he will welcome Mr Ian Paisley into No. 10 to discuss how
all-party talks might be encouraged. The Prime Minister is also eager to
consult with SDLP leader John Hume.
Yesterday two key factors were emerging: at long last the White House
approach to Gerry Adams and that of the US State Department are
converging. This development comes as the Sinn Fein leader tours America
raising corporate business funds for Sinn Fein, running into millions of
dollars, on the basis that the year-long ceasefire continues.
President Clinton granted a special visa to Adams earlier this year on
the understanding that he could deliver the IRA into making a start on
handing over its weapons.
The President, due to visit London and Ireland later this autumn, is
keen to have that pledge fulfilled. And the shift in the opinion of the
White House will strengthen the position of Mr Bruton in his coalition
Cabinet in Dublin.
On Friday Mr Major and Mr Bruton are scheduled to meet on the
sidelines of a cosmetic EU summit called by the Spanish Premier Felipe
Gonzalez.
Mr Trimble is set to play a key part in the process of committing the
Ulster Unionists to constitutional talks with Sinn Fein about the future
of Northern Ireland.
He said yesterday after his meeting with Mr Major: ''It was a very
good meeting. We've had a very extensive exchange of views. We have
agreed to keep in close and regular contact on these matters. Obviously
our discussions focused on the question of decommissioning and the
abortive summit with Dublin and the present state of the situation with
regard to that.''
Significantly Mr John Taylor, a rival candidate against Mr Trimble for
the Ulster Unionist leadership election, accompanied him at No. 10.
Later they went on to speak to the US ambassador, Admiral William Crowe,
with a view to sending to President Clinton an updated report on the
mood of the Ulster Unionists.
Mr Trimble also met Labour leader Tony Blair in his office at the
Commons to learn that, on the essentials of an IRA handover of weapons
and the ongoing peace process, a Tory/Labour bipartisan policy stands.
Mr Blair said afterwards: ''It was a very constructive meeting in
which we discussed the current state of the Northern Ireland peace
process to which Mr Trimble is clearly very strongly committed.''
This week Mr Blair has suffered the resignation from his front bench
of Mr Kevin McNamara who has stronger republican views than his leader.
Mr Blair is keen to persuade the Ulster Unionists in the Commons that
Labour would not be a soft touch for Sinn Fein/IRA should the Government
fall and Mr Blair be promoted to No. 10.
Mr Trimble is continuing the policy of his predecessor Mr Molyneaux in
encouraging talks with the Dublin Government and all the relevant
politicians in the coalition.
This will enhance his standing in Washington and the ongoing
manoeuvering in the three capitals to pressurise the IRA to deliver at
least some of its weapons before Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew and the Ulster Unionists can allow Mr Adams into political
discussions.

LABOUR Party MPs met in Glasgow yesterday to discuss an autumn
campaigning strategy which will try to put the Tories on the rack over
broken taxation promises and use Canada's current traumas over
separatism to embarrass the SNP.
Speaking after the party's autumn strategy meeting, Shadow Scottish
Secretary George Robertson said: ''We are going to organise a high
profile campaign on the Tory tax record, a full-frontal attack on their
betrayal of the ordinary taxpayer.''
But Scottish Conservative chairman Sir Michael Hirst defended his
party's record, saying the Government had to implement some rises to
help Britain's successful recovery from world-wide recession.
''The Conservatives have consistently cut income tax and widened the
lowest tax bands, whereas every Labour government over the past 40 years
has increased taxes,'' he said.
Mr Robertson said his party would also build a campaign around the
referendum in Quebec at the end of next month.

THE bodies of four Nimrod airmen killed in a crash in Canada were
received back at their Scottish base yesterday with full military
honours.
They died earlier this month when their reconnaissance jet crashed
into a lake while performing a complicated manoeuvre during an airshow
in Toronto.
All seven on board were killed. Another two are still in Canada
awaiting post-mortem examinations before being flown back to RAF Kinloss
in Morayshire.
The body of the seventh member lies trapped in the wreckage of the
plane 70ft below the surface of Lake Ontario.
Colleagues from the 120 Nimrod Squadron, based at Kinloss, bore the
four coffins, which were draped in Union Flags, from the tail of a
Hercules transporter while a lone piper played a lament.
Hundreds of RAF personnel gathered for the ceremony, headed by station
commander Group Captain Robert Joseph. He led the salute to the victims
of the worst disaster in the 30-year history of the aircraft.
The families of Flight Lieutenant Bernie Worthington, 37, of Norfolk;
Flight Lieutenant Glenn Hooper, 25, of Gloucestershire; Flight
Lieutenant Nick Brooks, 26, of Norfolk; and Sergeant Craig Barnett, 32,
of Norfolk, heard an RAF padre offer prayers.
RAF Kinloss spokesman, Squadron Leader John Horrocks, said: ''This
will end the agonising wait for some of the families and allow them to
grieve properly. The atmosphere on the base will not return to normal
until after all the men have been brought back home and laid to rest.''
The four men will be buried separately later this week in private
family funerals in their home towns in England or at their adopted homes
near the Scottish air base.
A full memorial service will be held later in the year for the crew
after they have all been buried.
An investigation by an official RAF board of inquiry into the cause of
the disaster is still under way.

NEW evidence has been disclosed which suggests two men were involved
in the Inverurie robbery in which 46-year-old Harold Petrie was stabbed
to death.
Police said they have descriptions of one man who assaulted Mrs Helen
Petrie inside the Inverurie Loco Works social club as she cleared up
after a disco, and another who was seen attacking her husband about 50
yards away at the spot where he was found dying a few minutes later.
Mr Petrie, the president of the football club, was found by police
officers responding to a 999 call from Mrs Petrie reporting the robbery.
Mrs Petrie, the club treasurer, was taken by surprise by the raider,
but was not injured.
Detective Chief Inspector Pat Shearer said the man seen entering the
club and who assaulted Mrs Petrie was wearing a camouflage jacket. The
collar was raised and the hood tied tight, obscuring his face.
The second man, aged between 18 and 25, of medium height and build,
and with short dark hair, was seen assaulting Mr Petrie at the junction
of Harlaw Drive and Harlaw Road. He was wearing a dark jacket and blue
jeans.
Police divers yesterday searched the River Ury and the River Don at
Inverurie for the murder weapon, which is believed to be a large knife.
The incident took place at around 2.30am on Sunday.
Mr Shearer appealed for anyone with any information to contact police.

AN anonymous Glasgow buyer bid #34,500 by telephone yesterday for Lady
Penelope -- the star puppet at an auction of Thunderbirds stars in
London.
Lady P was expected to fetch around #25,000 at the Phillips sale.
Owner Sylvia Anderson, former wife of Thunderbirds' creator Gerry
Anderson, was delighted with the sale. She said: ''The main thing is
that somebody appreciates her.
''I really had no idea at all what sort of price it would fetch.''
The next highest price at the auction was for a 2ft-high Captain
Scarlet, at #20,700.
Marina, the ''mystery'' girl from the series Stingray, fetched
#11,500.
Both were bought by private collectors.
However, puppets of Father Stanley Unwin from the series Secret
Service and Joe 90, the boy agent, failed to reach their reserve price.
The sales room at Phillips was packed, with many keen fans hoping to
pick up cheaper lots of heads and parts of the puppets from the Anderson
studios.
Sylvia Anderson, who divorced Gerry in the mid-Seventies, said it was
a good time to sell her collection.
''They were part of my family, but I travel a great deal and I have
problems of security,'' she said.
Modeller Mary Turner based the Lady Penelope puppet on Ms Anderson,
who also provided the voice.
Asked why she thought Thunderbirds was so successful, Ms Anderson
explained: ''We really weren't hampered in any way by political
correctness.
''Lady Penelope smoked and wore a fur coat and nobody thought of
animal rights.''
Several of the puppets in yesterday's sale had been on free loan to
the Museum of the Moving Image on the South Bank in London.

A GROUP of MPs emerged from a meeting with senior management of
British Aerospace yesterday ''heartened and reassured'' about the future
of the company's plant at Prestwick.
The five Ayrshire MPs -- Mr Brian Donohoe, Mr George Foulkes, Mr Phil
Gallie, Mr Willie McKelvey and Mr Brian Wilson -- spent 90 minutes with
chief executive Dick Evans and senior colleagues in London.
They had sought the meeting after major changes in the aviation
industry and speculation that these may adversely affect the Prestwick
operation and almost 2000 people who work there.
Among the concerns of the MPs, all of whom have constituents working
at the plant, were the implications of a joint venture deal betweeen the
company and French/Italian consortium ATR, potential work on the Future
Large Aircraft which the company hopes will replace the military
Hercules and reports that a regional jet deal with China may adversely
affect Prestwick.
Mr Evans, however, gave assurances that the future for the company
overall, which has halved its workforce in recent years and last week
reported improved figures, is bright.
He also promised that the company has no plans to withdraw from the
difficult field of turboprop airline production, such as the Jetstream
41, and that production will remain on the Ayrshire site for the entire
life of the project and beyond.

OLYMPIC swimming coach Paul Hickson yesterday admitted having sex with
a former top swimmer but denied raping her when she was 13.
Hickson, 48, told a jury they twice had sex when she was 19, when he
was director of coaching at the City of Coventry Swimming Club and
estranged from his wife.
Giving evidence in his defence, the coach strongly denied he had
regularly raped, beaten, and subjected his young protegee to other
serious sexual attacks.
Hickson, Britain's coach at the Los Angeles and Seoul games, is
accused of sex assaults on 13 of the teenage starlets in training squads
he formed while working at Norwich and the University of Swansea between
1976 and 1991.
At Cardiff Crown Court he claimed he had always behaved properly
towards the 13 year old during training sessions at the Norwich club,
where they had an excellent coach-pupil relationship.
Hickson denied her allegations, made in court, that when she was a
schoolgirl he told her to go on the Pill, telling her mother it would
boost performance in the pool.
The case continues.

A SENIOR Liberal Democrat figure has made the first positive response
to Tony Blair's overtures towards the party this week.
Former party president Charles Kennedy (above) said he wanted to get
discussions with Labour under way over constitutional reform, but would
not be drawn on the wider issue of electoral pacts.
The Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP said: ''I think once the dust of the
party conference season has settled, there will need to be some
sensible, constructive discussions back at Westminster about how we push
forward the case for constitutional reform.''
He told Channel 4 News: ''I think that the sooner that representatives
from Labour and the Liberal Democrats can discuss the constitutional
reform agenda and how we might push that forward at Westminster, the
better it will be for all of us in the reform camp, because that will be
devilishly difficult to advance.''

Washington
THE Washington Post has published a 35,000 word manifesto by the
Unabomber, the mysterious terrorist who has killed three people with a
series of letter bombs over the past 17 years.
Three months ago he sent his manifesto to the newspapers, saying that
he would end the bombings if the document were printed in either the
Post or the New York Times.
The deadline expires on Sunday, and after discussions with the
Attorney General and the FBI, the two papers decided to publish the
document ''for public safety reasons''. It appears in the Post; the
Times contributed to the cost.
The FBI and other authorities they consulted advised them to publish.
The Times' publisher said: ''It's awfully hard to put too much faith
in the words of someone with the record of violence that the Unabomber
has. But if you print it, and he doesn't kill anyone else, that's a
pretty good deal. You print it, and he continues to kill people, what
have you lost? The cost of newsprint?''
The FBI has 80 agents permanently on the case, 50 of them in the San
Francisco area, where the Unabomber may be based. He is thought to be a
white man in his 40s, and to work alone. Police suspect that he studied
science at the University of Chicago in the 1970s and then moved to
California.
Long extracts from his manifesto were published three months ago. Now
comes the full version, an eight-page denunciation of modern industrial
society. The Unabomber wants humanity to return to a simpler, agrarian
way of life.
His targets over the years were airlines, universities, chemical and
engineering companies. His last victim, killed last April, was an
executive with a timber company in San Francisco. His speciality is
carefully constructed bombs in hand-made wooden boxes.
Wood and trees often featured in the addresses of his targets, or in
their names.
The danger of submitting to the Unabomber's blackmail is that other
terrorists might follow his example.

<FLAG>ANNUAL CONFERENCE</FLAG>
<RECORDNO>976290093</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrats were described as ''killjoys'' yesterday as they
voted to cap National Lottery prizes and scrap the Instants scratchcard
games.
Conference representatives stepped back from putting a #1m upper limit
on lottery prizes, opting instead for an unspecified cap.
However, by a narrow majority of just 15 votes, voting 244 to 229,
representatives urged an end to the Instants.
They demanded a review of the guidelines for the distribution of
lottery proceeds and consideration of them for education, health and
housing projects.
The debate generated some of the most heated arguments of the
conference so far.
Calling for prizes to be capped and scratchcards abolished, Mr Andrew
Stunell, prospective parliamentary candidate for Hazel Grove, pointed to
medical evidence of ''scratchcard addiction''.
The stress and emotional trauma of winning up to #20m seemed to have
''destroyed more families than it has helped'', he said.
''This motion is hardly a killjoys' charter if it leads to a trebling
of the number of lottery millionaires.
''The case for cooling down the National Lottery is strong and
many-sided, if we are to re-establish common sense and confidence in
it.''
Opposing the move, Mr Peter Jones, from Amersham and Chesham, said
grants to cycleways and other good projects showed the lottery was not
all bad.
''We cannot tell people what to do with their own money,'' he said.
''Millions of people will turn round and say, we quite like buying
scratchcards -- mind your own business.
''Millions of voters enjoy the lottery every week. I don't want to
fight the next election as the spoilsport party, which is what we will
be if we pass this motion.''
Mr Rosemary Henley (Kingston) denounced the move as ''patronising
claptrap'' which was fundamentally illiberal.
''The way to make the National Lottery work and change peoples' lives
is to get the distribution of the funds generated changed to make it
work more effectively,'' she said.
Mr Chris Maines, (prospective parliamentary candidate for Bromley
South), said of peoples' rights to buy lottery tickets and scratchcards:
''Let them have their dreams and let us have ours.
''I am quite happy defending the party's brave and sensible policies
on drugs and properly funded education even if it means raising taxation
. . . but I am not very happy about the idea of fighting the next
election as killjoys dictating how people should behave.''
Mr Nasser Butt, of the party's multi faith forum, claimed the national
lottery was making the poor poorer and said it should go.
''I am not for restricting people's rights to do what they want but
we, as a national party, have another responsibility -- to do what is
good for society as a whole
''This motion limits the evils of the national lottery system but
doesn't get rid of it.''
Mr Charles Anglin, Lambeth, condemned the move to limit prizes as a
''sanctimonious, colonial missionary approach''.
It smacked of the nanny state telling the poor they were too stupid to
manage their own affairs.
Senior party sources later appeared to be relaxed about the vote and
did not expect it would prove an electoral liability.
One source said: ''There is a lot of dissatisfaction about the way the
system currently works and this will help to address that.''
Lottery operator Camelot later warned that capping the jackpot would
decrease sales and lead to less money being raised for good causes.
A spokesman said the average jackpot payout was #750,000 --
''substantially below'' what was generally assumed.He added that
scratchcards had been in wide use for many years and there was little
evidence they led to an increase in gambling.

STRICTER codes of conduct for those in public office to stamp out
sleaze were demanded by the Liberal Democrats yesterday.
The conference warned of a ''growing sickness'' in the country's
political system in the wake of the Nolan inquiry into standards in
public life.
Activists called for clear codes of conduct for those in public
service and an independent officer to oversee the effectiveness of
self-regulation.
They also urged reforms to the register of MPs' interests to ensure
the full disclosure of remuneration from outside work and demanded that
the bribery of MPs be made a criminal offence.
Opening the debate, Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Archy Kirkwood
challenged the Prime Minister to implement Nolan's recommendations
without delay and authorise the committee to undertake an investigation
of party funding.
''The Nolan committee cannot be used as a carpet under which the
endemic corruption in our political system is swept. The Nolan committee
must be given a chance to wipe out sleaze in politics once and for
all.''
Several representatives complained that the motion was too weak.
Monroe Palmer, prospective parliamentary candidate for Hastings and
Rye, said: ''It lacks teeth. We should say boldly and clearly that
financial corruption will be punished by a combination of fines,
community service and dismissal from office.
''We aren't in a sort of happy hour, where they can get off scot
free.''

FAST food chain Burger King, today contacted managers in its 350
restaurants to ensure there were no further cases of part-time staff
being paid so-called ''slave'' wages.
The move follows angry attacks from unions and the Labour Party after
a student revealed he was paid less than #1 for a five-hour shift at
Bishopbriggs, Glasgow.
The row intensified yesterday, with the Labour Party and the TUC
denouncing the company's ''slave labour practices''.
Commenting on reports that Glasgow youths employed at #3.10 an hour
were receiving as little as #1 for five hours after being ''laid off''
during the quieter periods, Labour employment spokesman Ian McCartney
declared his party would act to end slave labour practices which were
actively promoted by Tory Ministers opposed to pay protection for the
lower paid.
If there was ever an incident which showed the need for the statutory
national minimum wage proposed by Labour leader Tony Blair, this was it,
he said.
''The Scrooge tactics of Burger King's fat-cat directors show up the
unacceptable face of boardroom greed in Britain,'' added the MP for
Makerfield.
Salaries of top-paid directors of Burger King owners, Grand
Metropolitan, had jumped by 14.5% in the last year. They were now
earning more than #830,000 a year, representing a ''boardrom minimum
wage of #411 an hour''.
Burger King staff on #1 a shift would have to work for 40 years to
earn the #16,000 weekly wage of Grand Met's top paid director, he said.
TUC general secretary John Monks said it was scandalous that anyone
should have to work for such low wages.
No company should be allowed to get away with poverty pay, but the
Goverment was happy to let employers treat workers as badly as they
liked, adding that was the logical result of its hire-and-fire approach
to the labour market.
A spokeswoman for Grand Met said the Glasgow incident appeared to be
in breach of company policy, which was to set down weekly rotas in
advance. It was believed to be a one-off and was being investigated.
Meanwhile, Asda supermarket workers will protest at the company's AGM
today as part of their campaign for a minimum wage of at least #4 an
hour.
At the Leeds meeting, employee shareholders, who are members of the
GMB union, will be urging an increase for check-out staff who earn #3.67
an hour.

AN independent inquiry team is to be called in by the national housing
agency Scottish Homes to investigate the tragic death of 74-year-old
William Smith whose body was found in one of their houses in Glasgow
last month.
Windows of the house in the Parkhead area were boarded up by workers
from Scottish Homes who did not realise he was inside. The
procurator-fiscal is currently carrying out extensive inquiries into the
incident.
Last night Scottish Homes chief executive Peter McKinlay said the
independent inquiry would start once the fiscal had finished his
investigations.
A spokesman for the housing agency said the make-up of the inquiry
team into Mr Smith's death was still being looked at.
Two options being considered are either calling in a solicitor or
referring the matter to the local government ombudsman for
consideration.

THE 17-year-old schoolboy who took Glasgow University to court
claiming it had treated him unfairly by refusing him a place as a
medical student is to reapply for the same course next year, putting
Glasgow as his first choice.
Conor O'Reilly, of Newlands Road, Glasgow, who applied from St
Aloysius College with six A-pass Highers, last night received the Maths
A-level and Physics A-level prizes at his school's prize-giving.
He claimed in his court case the university had acted unreasonably and
in breach of the rules of natural justice by failing to inform
candidates they must have had work experience in a hospital, surgery, or
a caring environment.
The Court of Session upheld the university's case that while it
regarded work experience as desirable, it was not an essential
precondition.
His rejection by Glasgow University, on the grounds that despite his
outstanding academic qualifications, he had failed to communicate any
enthusiasm or commitment to a medical career, coupled with his decision
to reject the unconditional offers he received from four other Scottish
universities, has left him without a place for the coming academic year.
He said last night he was taking a year out before reapplying at all
five Scottish universities which offer medical degrees.
''I still would very much like to go to Glasgow. It is my first
choice,'' he said.
He also said he was looking at ''numerous options for various types of
work experience'' during his year out. These include a medical research
project in Edinburgh and another at Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital for Sick
Children specialising in cot death research.
A spokesman for Glasgow University said: ''Any application will be
considered afresh.''

Ovda Airbase, Israel
A STEWARD hijacked a planeload of Iranian holidaymakers to Israel
today where he surrendered and freed all 177 passengers and crew
unharmed.
The steward was seeking asylum in the United States, Israel Radio
reported. Five of the passengers also asked not to be sent back to Iran,
the Israeli army said.
The steward grabbed a pistol during the domestic flight, fired one
shot, and commandeered the Boeing 707 to the Jewish state, which Iran
views as its arch-enemy.
Tehran demanded the return of the hijacker but Israel refused. The two
countries have no diplomatic ties.
The hijacker wanted to go to Europe but the aircraft was short on
fuel, Israel Radio said. It landed at Ovda, a desert air base in
southern Israel. Israeli officials said the plane would be refuelled and
sent back to Iran tomorrow.
Passengers, including chador-clad women and children, walked calmly
from the aircraft about five hours after the flight was reported missing
en route from Tehran to the Gulf resort of Kish.
The passengers waited in a terminal normally filled with scantily-clad
Europeans bound for the Red Sea resort of Eilat. Some Muslim men knelt
for afternoon prayers.
The hijack, in closely-monitored skies of the tense region, caused
alarm. Israel shot down a Libyan airliner with 108 people aboard after
it strayed over its airspace in the early 1970s.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told reporters that Israel had
information that Saudi Arabia and Jordan had both refused to allow the
plane to land on their territory.
''What was reported to me was that the plane had little fuel, and I
did not want to be a partner or to bear responsibility for the crash of
a plane full of passengers,'' Rabin said.
Passenger Sair Onassa said the ordeal began with a bang.
''After 10 minutes of flight we heard a gunshot. The hijacker said
over the speaker -- 'Did you see it?' '' Onassa told Israel Radio.
''Three hours later we landed and we didn't know where we were.
Somebody guessed, maybe we are in Israel. After two hours we told one of
the pilots that the signs look like Russian. He said no, it was
Israel.''
Iran accused Israel of involvement in the hijacking and demanded it
return the plane and all aboard.
Conversation between ''the terrorist hijackers and Israeli officials .
. . indicated a pre-arranged scheme with the knowledge of the
Israelis'', reported the Iranian news agency.
Israel Radio picked up the conversation between the pilot and ground
controllers who diverted the aircraft away from Israeli population
centres.
The pilot told Israeli air controllers: ''We must make a crash landing
or land in Israel.''
He had asked to land in Tel Aviv but Israeli authorities feared his
intention might be hostile and directed him to Ovda, Israel Radio said.
Police Minister Moshe Shahal rejected the Iranian demands to return
the hijacker.
''One thing is clear. We are not returning him and not extraditing him
and he will remain here,'' he said.--Reuter.

THE Scottish Prison Service yesterday confirmed that it has withdrawn
prisoners on work placements at a centre for adults with special needs
in Inverness.
This follows a police investigation into allegations of sexual contact
between a prisoner and one of the adults attending the Corbett Centre.
However, no further action will be taken.
In a letter to Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy, who had
raised a constituent's concerns about the practice, SPS's chief
executive Eddie Frizzell says: ''Allowing prisoners to go out on work
placements is a sensitive issue, but as prisoners are released back into
the community at some stage, the better we can prepare them, the better
the chance of successful reintegration and the better prospects for
reducing reoffending.
''The use of work placements is extremely useful for preparing
prisoners for release. We always take care to ensure that placements are
suitable, but occasionally there are lapses, and, whatever their nature,
they attract media attention.
''In the specific case at the Corbett Centre, a police investigation
has determined that criminal proceedings are not appropriate. However,
because of the concerns that have been raised, the prisoners that were
there have been withdrawn and the centre is no longer being used as a
location for prisoner placements.''
Mr Kennedy said the policy had caused genuine concern, and he hoped
those involved would feel reassured by Mr Frizzell's reply.

THE Government's immigration policy came under fierce attack at the
conference yesterday as representatives condemned it as ''cruel'' and
''degrading''.
With tighter controls promised by the Tories, party supporters in
Glasgow overwhelmingly backed a motion calling for an independent body
to review detentions.
The motion deplored the Government's ''disregard for the human rights
of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers'' and urged that detainees
should not be held in ordinary prisons.
Mr Nasser Butt, of the party's multi-faith forum, said the problem was
not just the Government's attitude towards immigrants but the whole
culture of the Immigration Service.
''Imagine yourself escaping one torture and ending up with another,''
he said. ''It's a human rights abuse right in our backyard.''
However, Mr Mike Hopkins, from Enfield and Edmonton, warned that the
broader picture was being ignored and the motion invited only an
emotional response.
He said the system was under pressure, with 3000 new applications a
month and insisted detention centres provided a caring environment for
all.
Mr Marcus Streets, from Cambridge, said: ''We are faced with a
Government that will bring in yet another immigration Bill.''
Denouncing the Tories' ''Little Englander policies'', he urged people
to back the motion to allow Liberal Democrat MPs to fight the Bill in
Parliament.
Mr Baldev Sharma (Harrow) complained of a ''racist, two-tier system''
that allowed blacks to be detained while white European immigrants were
not.
''The racist card is always played by the Conservative Party in
collusion with the media at election time to get votes under false
pretences,'' he said.
Ms Jenny Dawe, winding up the debate, called the current system
''cruel, inhumane and degrading'' and said that in the last two years
the numbers held in detention had trebled, as had the duration of their
detention.

It all got a bit messy but Robert Harris seems to have cleaned up,
finds Stephen McGinty
It obsesses me that we are all citizens sold a lie by governments
IT'S the Robert Harris media tour and somebody has forgotten the
T-shirts. Like touring rock bands we should all be wearing them, big
baggy T-shirts, extra-long to cram in the dozens of dates which will be
typed in lower case; glasgow, lon-don, toronto, berlin, as if they have
just been spat out of the enigma machine, the code-cracker which lies at
the core of his cracking new thriller.
Everything else is in place. 400,000 copies of the new book Enigma are
displayed on shelves worldwide. The venues have been arranged;
bookstores, radio shows, publishers' conferences. The continental
flights are booked and his press attache has pages of appointments and
two mobile phones. Well, one does belong to Harris. Both are ringing.
It's the Times. They want Robert to write an article on Jewish access
to Swiss bank accounts. ''Everyone wants an article from Robert,''
explains Liz, Harris's PR, in a kind of exasperated
but-hey-it's-great-publicity type of way. I don't, I just want lunch,
and a few quotes. Delayed more than an hour by fog down at Heathrow, the
show has returned to the road. Harris is posing for pics with our
photographer now.
Then the film-crew arrives. The Omnibus team have been filming Harris
since the start, not of his promotional tour, but all during the
research and writing of the sequel to his astonishingly successful first
novel, Fatherland. Then the film-crew departs. They didn't want to film
me interviewing Robert. They wanted to tell us where they were parked.
Robert re-appears smart in a dark suit, shirt, tie and handkerchief
flourishing from his breast pocket. It's hard to imagine him in a satin
tour jacket and T-shirt, rock star shades, signing ladies' bosoms.
Best-selling authors may now make millions, and though comedy and poetry
have passed the baton on, books will never be the next rock 'n' roll.
Tucked in at a table in Cafe Rogano and the clock starts tick-tocking.
In one hour he will sign stock at three city centre stores before
travelling to Edinburgh. Then it is Bath, London, Leeds, Manchester,
Bristol, Cardiff, Southampton, Winchester, Cambridge, Newbury. Then
Toronto, LA, San Fransciso, New York, Washington, Chicago then back to
Germany to finish with three days at the Frankfurt Book Fair.
''Finished in all senses,'' quips Harris ordering a dry white wine.
You see, his current comfortable reality was not even a dream when the
initial 6000 run of Fatherland, plopped off the presses. But that simple
police procedural held at it's heart an important question. What if
Hitler had won? More than 4,000,000 people bought copies to find the
answer.
Harris believes the war continues to cast a shadow over the lives of
most middle-aged men. ''I think there is an odd emptiness. This odd
feeling that a lot of men my generation felt at not having fought. Most
generations before ours were expected to put on a uniform. People today
ask themselves, what would I have done? I would have liked to have been
Army, anywhere but the Far East or a pilot in fighters.''
The roar of fighter engines is replaced in Enigma by the rattle of
computing machines grinding through countless permutations in a bid to
crack the Nazi code. It is a book where the enemy is unseen. The mind is
the battlefield, and the darkened corridors of Bletchley Park, the home
of Britain's code-breakers and, some say, the birth-place of the modern
world.
One of the most chilling aspects of the novel is the silence demanded
by secrecy. The idea that code-breakers knew which ships would be
torpedoed, yet could do nothing to save them. To save the sailors would
be to reveal knowledge of Enigma, the axis on which the war hung. During
his research, Harris heard of a German Jewish code-breaker who learned
of the final solution, but could do and say nothing.
''Bletchley Park was the birthplace of the modern world, of
governments knowing more than they could ever reveal. Knowing so much
meant you had to lie. It made hypocrites of governments, and that is one
thing that obsesses me, that we are all citizens sold a lie.
''I guarantee you that it will emerge in six months' time that all
this bombing in Bosnia, it's either missed or has not been as effective
as Nato say. We are told that bombing is precise, but whether it is the
Second World War, Vietnam or the Gulf, bombs miss targets.
''I think that by going to examples like Engima you can suggest what
is happening now. That is my defence of writing books set in the past.
Shakespeare was able to say so much about Elizabethan politics by
setting plays in ancient Rome. You can be much more subtle than doing a
Michael Dobb's parody of the British Prime Minister.''
The art of telling a story and crunching huge mountains of information
into bite-sized chunks was taught to Harris during his years as a
journalist on Panorama and as political editor of the Observer. Every
sentence he now sees as a hook to further drag the reader along. Few
ever come loose. Yet the strict pressures of deadlines were nothing
compared to the challenge of besting Fatherland.
So why invite a film crew to record the event? ''Partly vanity,'' he
answers honestly. ''But I also thought it would be nice to see the
record of the writing of a book. There is so much bull-shit talked about
it. If I didn't have this film crew following me around I could say:
'Enigma, oh, I wrote it very quickly', as a way of defending myself
against attack.
''But it's not true. Most authors sweat, toil and do the very best
they can and then close the door on the engine room and swan around on
the bridge. I just wanted to show off the engine room.''

EXCISE workers and tax collectors have voted to create Britain's
newest super union. The merger of the National Union of Civil and Public
Servants (NUCPS) and the Inland Revenue Staff Federation (IRSF) will
create the largest tax union in Europe.
In Scotland the new organisation, to be called the Public Services Tax
and Commerce Union (PTC), will have 22,000 members including staff in
the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise, Coastguard, Forestry Commission
and all major civil service departments.
Ballot results released yesterday reveal 90% of NUCPS members were in
favour of the merger with 64% of IRSF members agreeing.
The merger, when it takes effect on January 1, will create the tenth
largest union in the TUC, and the largest in the civil service, with a
membership of 160,000.

A WOMAN who used her baby's buggy to smuggle drugs into Perth prison
was jailed for three years yesterday.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the cannabis Esther Dale, 24, a
mother of three, had in her possession was worth #530 on the street but
its value would be five times that in prison..
Dale, of Kerr Street, Bridgeton, in Glasgow, admitted possessing
cannabis resin with intent to supply it in the jail's visiting area on
May 29 this year.
Lord Allanbridge told her: ''Taking drugs into prison with intent to
supply it to another who could then use it in prison is something these
courts take very seriously and must be punished severely.''
The court heard that Dale was due to visit her husband, who is serving
five years for drugs offences, when police received a tip-off that she
would be carrying controlled drugs.
A search of the baby's pushchair tray revealed five pieces of cannabis
in a jacket.
Dale had been hooked on drugs since the age of 15, her defence
solicitor-advocate, Mr Maurice Smythe told the court.
She was caught in ''a downward spiral of crime'' and had previous
offences for drugs, dishonesty and prostitution, he said.
He urged the judge to consider imposing a non-custodial sentence.
But Lord Allanbridge told Dale: ''I am not prepared to do that. What
you have pled guilty to is a very serious offence indeed. I consider a
custodial sentence is necessary.''

POLICE in Inverness yesterday began investigations into the death of a
14-year- old boy who was killed when his father's shotgun went off in
his hands while he was watching television on Monday afternoon.
The body of Malcolm Williams, whose parents are doctors, was
discovered by his older brother Peter, 22.
Their mother, Dr Patricia Williams, a GP in Inverness, yesterday told
how her husband Frank, a consultant radiologist at Raigmore Hospital,
Inverness, kept his double-barrelled 20-bore shotgun and cartridges
locked away in separate cupboards. He used the gun to shoot rabbits
which used to invade their garden from surrounding farmland and the
neighbouring Inverness-Nairn rail line embankment.
Mrs Williams said: ''Malcolm knew about guns because he had an air
rifle, but never showed any apparent interest in Frank's shotgun, and
certainly wasn't allowed to use it. I don't know what made him
interested on this occasion. He must have taken advantage of the hour he
knew he was being left alone in the house to find the keys to the
cupboards and load and examine the gun.
Speaking at the family home, Seafield of Raigmore House, a mile
outside Inverness on the Inverness to Nairn road, Mrs Williams added:
''We think it was just a stupid, tragic accident. He must have been
fiddling about with the gun while he watched TV and it went off
accidentally.''
Her husband, Dr Frank Williams, agreed: ''We do not think it was
suicide. Malcolm was looking forward to us all going on holiday next
month to Canada to visit our daughter Kate, who is an exchange
psychology student there. He was his normal cheery self and had no
problems we knew about.''
He went on to describe how his son, Peter, arrived home from his work
in the local benefits office and started to make something to eat in the
kitchen.
''He could hear the television was on and assumed Malcolm was sitting
watching it. Peter shouted through, asking him if he wanted something to
eat as well, and jokingly asked if he was expected to do all the work.
''It was only when he got no reply he went to investigate and found
Malcolm dead. It was a terrible shock for him, naturally, but he has
gone back to work. Perhaps it is better having something to occupy
himself with. I have told the police to keep the shotgun. I don't want
it back.''
Malcolm was in his fourth year at Culloden Academy. Headmaster Derek
McGinn said yesterday: ''I was devastated when Mr Williams phoned me
with the news. Malcolm was a good student, a very bright pupil -- in
fact a model pupil. He was a wee bit shy, but had a good circle of
friends.''

STRATHCLYDE region is swiftly introducing new safeguards to ensure it
will never be duped again after the Brandon Lee incident.
Pupils enrolling at school in the fifth or sixth years will be asked
to bring documentation to prove their age to the school's headteacher.
The bizarre mystery of why 32-year-old Brian MacKinnon passed himself
off as 17-year-old Brandon Lee at Bearsden Academy deepened yesterday
when the region revealed that he gained six Highers when he was a
teenager at the school, with A passes in English, Chemistry, Physics and
Geography with B passes in Mathematics and German.
Checks with the Scottish Examination Board show that he had not in the
intervening years taken examinations at any other school as Brandon Lee
-- the name of a movie actor who died while making the film The Crow.
Mr Norman MacLeod, headteacher at Bearsden, said Brandon Lee was a
''model, ideal pupil,'' during his year at the school.
''I am very sad about the whole situation,'' he said yesterday. ''Not
for myself, but given what has happened, I feel extremely sad for him.
He left our school highly recommended, accepted by the medical school at
Dundee University, and was determined to be a doctor. Now he has been
publicly crucified.''
When asked why no-one spotted the pupil was nearly twice the age he
was supposed to be, or the fact that the same person had returned to the
school 13 years later, Mr MacLeod explained: ''It is very easy for
people to say that with hindsight. But if you look at the video of our
school production of South Pacific which he appeared in, you don't see a
grown man with a beard or anything like that, but a slim, thin-faced
18-year-old.
''I looked at his original picture from the files and there's
obviously a resemblance, but this is a school of 1300 pupils, and we are
talking about almost 13 years ago. Nobody recognised him.''
Mr MacLeod has also been asked if the name Brandon Lee, being that of
a film actor, should not have raised suspicions, but as the grey-haired
headteacher pointed out: ''Well you can see from the colour of my hair
that Brandon Lee doesn't mean a thing to me. Perhaps if he had been
Robert E Lee . . . ''
As for any suspicions in general, Mr MacLeod commented: ''Nobody had
any reason to doubt him. He was really quite outstanding in his school
work, appearing in the play and writing for the school magazine. There
was never even a hint of nastiness. He was very placid, well mannered
and well groomed.
''Why did he do this? I certainly don't know.''
It was only after an anonymous tip-off 12 days ago that Mr MacLeod
became suspicious and he arranged a meeting with Mr MacKinnon two days
later, when he asked the former pupil to prove his identity. He has not
seen Mr MacKinnon since.
''I do not normally take anonymous telephone calls but it had been
rumoured in Bearsden that there was a discrepancy and I had to check
this out,'' he said.
''He did not know for sure what he was being summoned for and at that
moment as far as I was concerned he was still my ex-model pupil. My
feelings on the meeting are that he did not satisfy me in terms of total
vindication.''
Although Brandon Lee or Brian MacKinnon may have looked older outside
school, wearing the school uniform of black trousers, white shirt and
school tie seemed to take years off his appearance.
Suggestions being made amongst the pupils yesterday at the school were
that Mr MacKinnon left the first time to study medicine but had to leave
due to ill health. He then spent some time in Canada before returning to
Bearsden where he hit on the idea of returning to his old school.
His elderly mother, Mrs May MacKinnon, who is very distraught by the
whole affair, is said to have believed her son was returning to school
as an adult, which is now allowed.
Said Mr MacLeod: ''It came as a surprise to her. It was a private
conversation between myself and her and she ended up in floods of
tears.''
In fact Strathclyde education department said yesterday that he would
have been very welcome as an adult student under the normal procedures
for adult students attending a secondary school.
Meanwhile, the education department says the school was blameless. Mr
MacKinnon had gone to the school saying he had just returned from Canada
and was staying with his grandmother in Bearsden.
''Having looked at the documentation provided it is perfectly
understandable the school accepted Mr Lee and we are satisfied the
headmaster acted in good faith,'' said senior depute director of
education David Alexander.

THE secret lives of Brandon Lee, the man in his thirties who
masqueraded as a 17 year old pupil at one of Scotland's most popular
secondary schools, and as a teenage medical student at Dundee
University, unfolded yesterday.
It emerged that he had studied for six years at Glasgow University in
the 1980s and, although he completed an honours science course, did not
graduate.
He was enrolled at Glasgow as Brian Lachlan MacKinnon in 1980 and
spent three years studying medicine before dropping out. He returned to
the university in 1986, and in 1989 finished his BSc course. Pathology
was his main subject.
But in August last year, at the age of 32, he was enrolled as fifth
year pupil Brandon Lee at Bearsden Academy near Glasgow. After one year
-- during which he was described by headteacher Norman MacLeod as a
model pupil -- he passed five Highers at the top A grade.
As Brian MacKinnon, he had gained four As and two Bs, also at Bearsden
Academy. It also emerged yesterday that about half the school's present
teaching staff worked there when he was a pupil first time around.
Having been an exemplary pupil for the second time -- although no-one
knew of his secret past -- Brandon Lee went on to Dundee University to
study medicine from October to December last year, but dropped out for
personal reasons.
Professor Bob Sturrock, who taught Lee at the university, recalled
yesterday: ''He was here for the first term, then he disappeared. He
said his granny had died. There was also a note saying he had taken a
year out for financial reasons. This is not uncommon.
''The next we heard about him was on the news and in the newspapers.
He was quiet in classes, always carrying his briefcase. We had a few
mature students and he was definitely one of them. That was how he
looked. He did not look 17.
''He was always in the background. He was not somebody who drew a lot
of attention. He just got on with it.''
To add to the mystery, Bearsden Academy pupils and staff spoke of him
having an American or Canadian accent.
One of the many unanswered questions about this latter-day Walter
Mitty character is why, having come through a challenging honours
science course, he did not graduate from Glasgow University.
Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that he was desperate -- to use Mr
MacLeod's adjective -- to become a doctor. Things went wrong for him in
the third year of his medicine course at Glasgow first time around, and
although, like many others, he transferred successfully to the science
faculty, he chose not to graduate.
If he had, his details would have appeared in the General Council
Register, which is open to public scrutiny.
The fact that he did not graduate made it much harder to establish if
he had been to university, particularly if a change of identity was
involved.
If he had graduated, or if he had kept his original name and age, he
would not have been eligible to have his tuition fees for medicine paid
-- running well into five figures over five years -- or to have
qualified for maintenance grant to help with his living expenses when he
returned to study for the vocation he craved.
Social psychologist, Dr Geoffrey Scobie, said Mr Lee's very success in
deceiving so many people suggested, in the classic Walter Mitty
syndrome, that he was deceiving himself as well.
Dr Scobie, senior lecturer at Glasgow University, said: ''When people
lie to others, there is usually eventually some sign that they are not
telling the truth. That is what lie detector technology depends on.''
''Walter Mitty-type characters get away with it because they are
actually living the lie. They believe it so implictly that there is no
embarrassment, no dividing line between their real personality and the
character they are pretending to be.''
On the other hand, Dr Scobie pointed out, Mr Lee was reportedly
unmasked when fellow students found his real passport.
''That could suggest a very elaborate deliberate deception designed to
achieve his aim to become a medical student.''
The boy who lived with his mum in a council house on the periphery of
the academy's catchment area -- chose to go back to school, dispose of
15 years of his life, take on a new identity, and try again to become a
doctor.
As his game plan progressed he amassed a truly astonishing batch of
qualifications, the friendship of fellow pupils, and the respect of
teachers. But in the end his deceit caught up with him.

LIKE all political parties, the Liberal Democrats suffer from the
men-in-suits factor. Not to mention the men in sandals. (Damn, we had
promised ourselves not to mention the sandals image of the Liberals.)
A perfect antidote to all this, therefore, at the Lib-Dem conference
in Glasgow is Clare Hamblen of Bearsden. At 21, she is the youngest
councillor in Scotland.
She is also one of the stars of a politics spread in Cosmopolitan. In
Cosmospeak, Clare, left, is an apparat-chick, a party girl, one of a new
generation of young people who have embraced politics because they are
tired of the way the aforementioned suits are ruining the country.
In real life, Clare is a student nurse who has spoken at party
conferences on pay issues and is contributing to the Lib-Dem manifesto
on health policy. Clare would disagree with the statement that the suits
are in charge of her party: ''In the Scottish Liberal Democrats there's
a great deal of participation. Young people and women don't feel left
out.''
Being Cosmopolitan ''party animal'', Clare, who is a comely lass, had
to get her party frock on for a photo-shoot. For those into matters
sartorial as well psephological, the black velvet dress was from
Littlewoods catalogue and the vote-for-me-quick shoes from Kurt Geiger.
Quote quotas
WE mentioned yesterday Lib-Dem president Bob Maclennan's impressive
list of literary and cultural references in his speech to conference --
from Debussy to Dantan via E M Forster. His leader, Paddy Ashdown, while
much more Churchillian in demeanour, had a meagre sprinkling.
Archimedes, Bertold Brecht, Mel Gibson in a reference to brave hearts,
Frank Bruno, and Rex Knapper.
The Bruno quote was: ''Look who's champion now! Know what I mean,
'Arry?'' Rex Knapper is an obscure but honourable Conservative
councillor from the south coast of England. We mention him simply
because we feel his splendid cognomen should not go unrecorded.
Policy of prudence
WE'RE not saying that Jim Wallace, leader of the Scots Lib Dems, has a
reputation for being careful with his bawbees but during the annual
conference pass-the-hat fund-raising session the chap who was trying to
wring cash, cheques, and promissory notes from the assembled ranks said
he was looking forward to receiving Jim's donation in ''pounds Scots''.
The current exchange rate is about #8 sterling for #100 Scots.
* STILL on matters fiscal, a party of Lib Dems, dining in the Cantina
del Rey mexican restaurant in King Street, Glasgow, brought a whole new
meaning to ''who had the rice?''
In calculating who was to pay what, the diner-in-charge left some
interesting working in the margin of the bill, which the staff have kept
as a collector's item. The bill of #188.95 was rounded up to #200 for a
tip, divided by 14 and multiplied by two.
Pretty straightforward -- until they then divided this answer by six
and added on #14.29 to reach a final total of #19.05. They were
obviously not real politicos since no-one picked up the receipt.
NICK COMFORT, until recently political editor of the Daily Record, has
just published a new edition of his impressive and invaluable (#20,
actually) reference book Brewer's Politics -- A Phrase and Fable
Dictionary.
We are sure it is entirely coincidental and not a reflection of Nick's
time covering the Scottish political scene that in his alphabetically
arranged book SNP is sandwiched between ''snouts in the trough'' and
''so little done, so much to do''.
Slash-dash affair
THE Glasgow Ale Festival opens for business tomorrow and Russ Sweeny
of Camra is on with proof, were it needed, that enjoyment of traditional
beers is not only pursued by fat, bearded, boring gits. (Yes, we are
aware that the Diary fits this profile almost exactly.)
Russ tells us of the young recruit to real aledom who wanted to try a
pint of Belhaven 70/-. Being a child of the decimal coinage era, he knew
nothing of pounds, shillings, and pence and asked for a pint of
''Belhaven seventy slash dash''. The dash and slash festivities commence
at 3pm tomorrow at the Arches in Midland Street.
Powder and plot
WE conclude our foray into the world of pub quizzes with further
examples of the art of being a Quizling. Alex Drysdale of Edinburgh
reveals: ''One way to succeed is to have one or more women in the team.
If you get stuck on a question, the woman can pretend to go and ''powder
her nose'', taking her bag with her, in which she has cunningly
concealed How To Win Any Pub Quiz (the book which started the whole
debate). She can look up the answer in the toilet and swiftly return to
tell the team.''
Mr Drysdale adds: ''Bitter experience has also taught us that the only
way to win first prize in the Aberdeen University Union Quiz was to be a
flatmate of the quizmaster.''
Dick Sim of Arran suggests a more hi-tech version of the
weak-bladdered lady-team-member ploy. While she's out she uses her
mobile phone to contact Quizling HQ where an operative checks the
answers on relevant databases.
Both of the above win a copy of How To Win Any Pub Quiz. But the star
prize of a bottle of Glengoyne malt whisky goes to Eddy Cavin of
Lochwinnoch for a truly West of Scotland tale.
He was hosting a quiz at a bowling club where the decoration of choice
was numerous pictures of the royal family and the favourite colour
scheme red, white, and blue. One of his questions was in which year had
there been three popes.
There was a long silence. After some coaxing that it was worth a try,
one team finally volunteered the answer -- 1978. ''Correct. Two
points,'' said Mr Cavin. ''We don't want them,'' was the steadfast
reply.

RESEARCH into the ''greening'' of important Glasgow buildings, caused
by algae which takes hold after their stonework has been cleaned, was
discussed at a gathering of leading art conservation scientists in the
city yesterday.
The conference, which ends today and includes papers on conserving
world-renowned artworks and buildings, heard conservation scientist Dr
Kirby Talley from the Dutch Ministry of Culture warn: ''It may be that
Glasgow will become the new Emerald City.''
Buildings affected by algae include the City Chambers and the Stewart
Memorial Fountain in Kelvingrove Park, cleaned in 1990.
Delegates also heard evidence from Robert Gordon University biologist
Rebecca Wakefield showing sandstone to retain damaging chemicals such as
silicon and magnesium as little as six hours after cleaning.
Conference co-ordinator Dr Norman Tennent of Strathclyde University
said he believed some chemicals used to clean buildings increase the
vulnerability of stone to algae.
He said: ''The process is making the stone susceptible. Each grain
becomes like a sponge with points at which the algae can take hold.
''It is very common for methods to be used in stone restoration which
are not tried and tested. The point of our meeting was to provide the
scientific groundwork to assess these processes.''

VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY, the Russian fascist, calls his followers the
Liberal Democrats. The same name was chosen long ago by the ruling party
of Japan, a fairly random assemblage of political racketeers now
dissolving in scandal and corruption.
It is not even as if, in those instances, Liberal Democrats are trying
to convey an idea of their essential niceness, which is presumably the
reason why the lot meeting in Glasgow this week claim the title. It all
goes to show, in case we needed any proof, that political expressions
are pretty meaningless, that part of the political task is to twist and
distort, to throw dust in the eyes, while the politician gets on with
what he is anyway forced to do. The only outstanding exceptions in my
time to this almost universal rule have been General Charles de Gaulle
and Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
They were, of course, politicians who actually did things rather than,
like most of their lesser fellows, merely talking. If we try to define
what they did, we find radicalism and conservatism inextricably mixed up
in it, so that there is no one label we can satisfactorily apply.
Perhaps it is ever thus with real political achievement.
Political language, on the other hand, strives at least to be simple,
though being simple is in fact rather difficult and in these days of
deficient literacy a tall order. If we take the talk alone, however,
there appears to me to be a fairly clear spectrum in British politics at
the moment.
By far the most right-wing party is New Labour, insistent on monetary
and fiscal rectitude, with a preference in principle for low taxation
over high taxation (but this is, remember, only talk). In the centre is
the Conservative Party, with three centuries of pragmatism behind it, a
position always reinforced when in power by the pressure of events, to
which it likes gracefully to defer; though this Government has been so
horribly battered by them that it has little will to stick hard or
consistently at anything. And by far the most left-wing party is the
Liberal Democrats.
In part it is just a matter of abuse of terms. Unexceptionable as it
may be to call yourself a Democrat, we should recall that this party is
an uncritical supporter of the only anti-democratic element we have been
foolish enough to introduce into our constitution, the European
Commission.
To call yourself a Liberal used to mean, in William Ewart Gladstone's
time, that you supported the freedom of the individual, of which the
indispensable condition was a limited state -- what Paddy Ashdown would
condemn as Thatcherite. Now it still means supporting the freedom of the
individual, I grant you, but defining the indispensable condition of it
as a strong state. This strikes me as inconsistent to the point of being
wacky, but the British Liberal Democrats are not alone to blame. The
term liberalism is commonly employed to mean, on both sides of the
Atlantic, two contrary things, the positions of Gladstone and of
Ashdown. Given the political corruption of language, I suppose we shall
just have to put up with that.
It still does not fully explain quite why the Liberal Democrats are to
be found right over on the left of British politics, a niche they have
indeed occupied for quite a while. I would date their taking it up to
the early 1980s, when the opposition parties, knocked for six by
Thatcherism, were desperately scrabbling to define their reaction to it.
For the Liberals, as they were at the time, this meant diehard defence
of ideas that even the old welfare state had rejected. They still
advocated prices and incomes policies, control, by bureaucrats, of
things that must self-evidently be set in a market, as is universally
recognised today. They shared belief in these policies only with the
government of the dying Soviet Union (perhaps this was where the
Zhirinovsky connection came in).
True, they did later start talking about markets. Despite a diligent
search, I can find no resolution of the Liberal Party or its successor
which formally repudiated its earlier Stalinism and accepted that
Western societies run on markets. The conference debate would have been
interesting to hear. But I assume the truth is that nobody cares a damn
how Liberal Democratic economic policy is worked out, or what it is, so
that the relevant spokesman is left to make it on the hoof and say the
first, or at least the nicest, thing that comes into his head.
That was certainly the case with the former spokesman, Alan Beith, a
man incomprehensible on two counts: for his gabble and for the complete
shamble of his ideas. The present spokesman, Malcolm Bruce, is more of a
charmer, pronounces his words clearly and leaves no doubt about what he
means to do if he can -- which is to start guiding the Liberal Democrats
back towards Stalinism.
I see that the higher taxation he wishes to impose is meant to be
devoted to education. But I should like to know how, if education is
favoured, all the other interest groups in the country are to be
deterred from turning up at his door demanding the same favour for their
equally compassionate causes, and why he should want to turn them away.
I should also like to know how the extra money which he tender-heartedly
hands out is to be stopped from getting diverted into the pockets of the
interest groups themselves, rather than used to benefit the public.
These were, after all, the real problems of the welfare state, to
which Bruce has no answer except to put himself in charge of it. They
are also, by the way, the real and apparently intractable problems of
the state created by the Liberal Democrats of Japan. Perhaps political
terms are not so meaningless after all.

A MAJOR fire at the Poundstretcher department store in Shandwick
Place, brought rush hour chaos to Edinburgh city-centre yesterday, as
shops were evacuated and roads sealed off as 50 firefighters tackled the
blaze, which caused extensive damage to the ground floor.
Lothian and Borders Police said the cause of the fire, which began
around 3.30pm and was brought under control by 5pm, was still being
investigated, but it did not appear to be suspicious. No-one was

THE disclosure this week of the case of ''Brandon Lee'', the
32-year-old man who masqueraded as a 17-year-old, returned to school in
Bearsden, passed five Highers, and was accepted for medicine at Dundee
University before his fraud was discovered is both sensationally bizarre
and completely compelling.
How can a thirty-something chap possibly pass as a teenager? What's
Lee got that all the men I know ain't got? Perchance a funny fountain in
his back garden?
More fascinating than the practicalities of Lee's deception is his
possible motivation; the notion of a second shot at life is a resonant
one, which must strike a chord in even the most stoic soul. The
oft-voiced phrase ''I wouldn't change a thing'' is surely an
over-demonstrative one.
Yes, we learn from our mistakes and que sera sera is all very well
but, given the chance, who wouldn't turn the clocks back and tweak our
personal histories just a little? We could rescue squandered time to
work harder for exams, learn a foreign language, avoid that disastrous
relationship, or perhaps simply cherish moments with a special someone
who is no longer around.
Regrets haunt even the most successful lives but don't have to be a
negative force. Regrets over lost opportunities can be motivating
factors, sometimes encouraging people to shake up their lives and make a
fresh stab at living. With the right attitude, regret can be channelled
into rejuvenation, although few would go quite so far as to undertake
the kind of transformation which Lee favoured.
The point is not to fight time but to embrace it, not to glance
wistfully back at the past but to look confidently towards the future
which offers a potentially bigger vista, with time to do virtually
anything, from learning that foreign language to learning how to fly,
from exploring continents to exploring self.
But we constantly deny the promise of our future because of our fear
of it; Western society, fated with media images of healthy youth -- and
worshipping unhealthy youth, viz the anorexic Calvin Klein adolescents,
is sick with the terror of ageing.
Lee's choice was perhaps less to do with correcting past mistakes and
more to do with a vain attempt to recapture his youth, physically doing
what many people daily do mentally, drowning their present lives in
waves of nostalgic memories. Sure, if I could do it all again, I'd do
some things differently; none the less I find omnipresent fetishising of
youth revolting in the extreme.
It's so superficial, so appearance-based. I guess it would be nice to
look the way I did when I was 17. No, maybe not the haircut -- blonde
highlights, what was I thinking of?
Hey, I'm only female and I can't deny that it would be nice to weigh
what I did when I was 17, but I would never trade the creeping lines,
grey hairs, and extra pounds for that hormone-charged, confusing teenage
mess of pride and insecurity.
Why do we so quickly forget that a big part of being young is, well,
really yucky? Why can't we revere, as Eastern cultures do, the wisdom of
experience?
I'm genuinely perplexed by the attitude of many of my peers who treat
the approach of the big 3-0 as a traumatic milestone. I look forward to
getting older. The only birthday I've so far approached with dread was
my 26th, when I realised that I was no longer eligible for a Young
Person's Rail Card. I didn't give a hoot about not being officially
recognised as a young person any more, I just missed the discounts.
The times when I have hung on to youth have been inspired by such
expediency, like desperately pretending to be half fare on the bus long
after it was plausible, even when I was paradoxically dressed and made
up to look older in an audacious attempt to get into an over-18s' disco.
I had to cough up full fare but got into the club. Definitely a fair
trade. Age has only brought advantages.
I don't want to be 19 forever or forever young. I can't begin to
empathise with Dorian Grey or ''Brendan Lee''. I look forward to
maturing -- perhaps mellowing with age, but more likely growing old
disgracefully.
I'll probably have the same penchant for lotions and potions that I do
now, although hopefully I'll opt for the stark style of the late Jean
Muir rather than the gooey slap of Barbara Cartland, and hopefully my
love affair with all things cosmetic won't extend to surgery.
PERHAPS by the time I'm truly in my prime women will no longer be
deemed to hit the scrap heap when they hit the menopause.
Why fight the inevitable? I reckon being young has little to recommend
it; to believe anything else is to fly in the face of fate and court
lifelong discontent. In a scene from the newly released Carrington
Lytton Strachey, played by Jonathon Pryce, turns to Dora Carrington,
played by Emma Thompson, and complains that he has nothing to look
forward to but old age.
''Can you imagine it?'' He despairs gloomily: ''The rain, the
loneliness, the regret.''
She rejects his pessimistic vision calmly and firmly: ''No, I can't
imagine.''
Me neither, I'm happy to grow up.

A MOTORIST was convicted yesterday of causing an elderly man's death
by dangerous driving.
A jury at Edinburgh Sheriff Court found Michael Jhoomun, 27, guilty of
causing the death of Polish war veteranr Anthony Watt-Parker, 86, who
died a week after the incident in Edinburgh's Broughton Street last
October 1.
Jhoomun, of Upper Craigour, Edinburgh, was also found guilty of taking
the car without permission and failing to stop after the accident or
report it.
He was also convicted of careless driving after a second accident,
failing to stop and report the second crash, driving a car with a
defective tyre, and driving without a licence or insurance.
One witness said Jhoomun got out of the car and looked at Mr
Watt-Parker lying in the road before getting back in and driving off,
leaving behind his passenger, who had also got out.
Shortly afterwards, he ran into the back of a Porsche Carrera in
Calton Road, causing #400 worth of damage.
Jhoomun told police he panicked after hitting Mr Watt-Parker because
he did not have documents for the car. He had not looked too badly
injured, he said.
Sheriff Iain Macphail, QC, said the charge involving Mr Watt-Parker's
death was a particularly serious matter and pointed out Jhoomun had a
criminal record running to more than three pages.
He deferred sentence until October 17 for background reports and
allowed Jhoomun bail.

Allan Laing interviews the man who has interviewed the great and the
good of the world, and a few scoundrels
SIR David Frost tells the story himself. There he was, talking through
his career with an audience of students at London University. ''What
would you like to be remembered for?'' asked someone, echoing the
ubiquitous question which he asks of all his interviewees. And, before
he could answer, a wag from the back shouted ''Ever!''
Sir David chuckles at the memory and says: ''Not a bad thought,
actually.'' We are sitting in his office in a converted mews cottage off
Kensington High Street, a few hundred yards from Holland Park. I have
his undivided attention. The phone never rings; there are no
interruptions. One suspects that, busy man though he is, he has
instructed his PA to hold all calls. It is a refreshing example of good
manners on his part.
What we have is a window in his diary. A big hour-long window which
offers some interesting, if unspectacular, views. But when the hour is
over, the window is shut. ''I have to be somewhere,'' he explains. Fair
enough.
''Would you like a cigar?'' he asks, proferring a huge Havana. This,
one assumes, is his polite way of informing you that he's going to smoke
and that you're welcome to join him.
Despite the humidity, Sir David looks a million dollars. No beads of
sweat, not a hair out of place, a perfect crease in his trousers. His
only concession to the weather is an unbuttoned shirt collar. You
imagine that he is the kind of man who could step off an aircraft after
a Transatlantic flight looking as sartorially perfect as he did when he
stepped on board.
Someone once said that if you were to cut Sir David Frost open and
examine his veins you would find, not blood coursing through them, but
625 lines. He is the complete Television Man. The medium provides him
with all his reference points. Without it he would be -- well, he
probably would not be.
So, when he is dead, what would he like to be remembered for? It is a
question, of course, which he has been asked many times before. He
doesn't need time to consider the answer. He directs me to a remark made
by the late Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Dayan (yes, he interviewed
him) who, when asked the same question soon after his success in the Six
Day War of 1967, replied: ''When I am dead, I am dead; and that is what
I am dead for -- not to worry about anything. You can say whatever you
like of me after I am dead.''
Then again, says Sir David, there was the line from his Robert Kennedy
interview (conducted only weeks before the politician's assassination).
Kennedy's reply was to quote Albert Camus who said that, though this
world is one in which children suffer, perhaps we can lessen the number
of suffering children. Sir David, like Robert Kennedy -- a man he
admired tremendously -- would like to feel he had done something to
lessen the suffering.
The hook for interviewing the great interviewer is the fact that Sir
David will feature as the voice-over for a series of television and
radio adverts promoting The Herald. The clear message is that this
newspaper, above all others in Scotland, offers ''a distinctive voice''.
So does Sir David consider his to be a distinctive voice?
''Well, if you take that question literally then I have always been
told that I have a distinctive voice. My accent, back in the sixties,
was always portrayed as the classless accent. In fact, it is a sort of
50-miles-outside-London accent.
''My father was a Methodist minister and we lived in places like Kent,
Bedfordshire, and Northamptonshire. Whether or not my accent is
classless, I don't know, but the perception that it is has helped me a
lot with my sort of parallel career in the States. It means that it is
not too difficult for them to comprehend,'' he explains.
But, in metaphorical terms, is Sir David Frost's a distinctive voice?
In other words, are the things he does and the programmes he makes
distinctive?
''Obviously that's for others to decide, but I hope there has been a
distinctive tone to everything I have done. I've always tried to say yes
to new challenges and, whether it be That Was The Week That Was, The
Frost Programme, the talk shows, or the longer interviews, I hope there
has been a distinctive voice there,'' he replies.
Sir David Frost was once described (rather unkindly by Kitty
Muggeridge in the 1960s) as the man who ''rose without trace''. The
remark was more a snobbish swipe at the television medium than it was at
the man himself. But the description has somehow adhered to him over the
years. This is perhaps because of the very nature of his role in
television. Though he clearly possesses a very dominant personality, he
seldom, if ever, allows it to interfere with his job. Nor do you ever
catch a glimpse of his politics (does he have any?) or his prejudices
(he is human; he must surely have them).
Sir David Frost remembers ''with absolute crystal clarity'' the first
time he appeared in front of a camera. It was December, 1959. He was a
student at Cambridge and the local commercial station, Anglia, was
making a special Christmas edition of its weekly magazine programme,
Town and Gown. The producer decided to make a one-off spoof, a parody
show, so he invited two young men from the renowned Cambridge Footlights
to do the business. They were David Frost and Peter Cook.
''We went to film it in Norwich and the moment I walked into the
studio it felt like home. A television studio is an unnatural
environment but I knew that I was comfortable with it from the very
start,'' he recalls.
Sir David never looked back -- or if he did, it was only to wave a
fond farewell to those less ambitious Cambridge contemporaries he left
behind. Many of them caught up, of course. There were the actors (Derek
Jacobi and Ian McKellen) and the politicians (Norman Lamont, Leon
Brittan, and Michael Howard) and a host of others (Cook, Christopher
Booker, and Trevor Nunn, for example).
After a spell at Rediffusion, Ned Sherrin, at the time an ambitious
young TV producer, invited him to join the team of a new Saturday
late-night programme for the BBC. That Was The Week That Was was the
satirical show by which all subsequent television satire was measured.
Nothing like it had ever been made before. Though tame by today's
standards, it was almost anarchic for its day. It relied upon the
creative talents of people like Lance Percival, Willie Rushton, and John
Bird but it was Frost, the ''Hello, Good Evening, and Welcome'' front
man with the clipboard and the heavy-rimmed glasses, who came through
and hit celebrity status.
Following its success came The Frost Programme. In this writer's
opinion it was during this period that Frost, still in his early 20s,
had his greatest television moment. Indeed, it was one of the great
moments in television. Emil Savundra was a supercilious businessman who
in the sixties persuaded an unwitting public to deal with his Fire Auto
and Marine Insurance company. He was later unmasked as a swindler.
When his nefarious activities hit the headlines, The Frost Programme,
topical as ever, featured a sketch (written by Barry Cryer) with a spoof
insurance company called Fire Renewal And Universal Debt (FRAUD). After
the programme was broadcast, the arrogant Savundra telephoned the Frost
office to say how much he had enjoyed the joke.
Now you have to remember that every newspaperman in the country was
desperately trying to track the villain down, but to no avail. So, with
Savundra still on the line, someone shouted: ''Ask him if he'll appear
on next week's programme!'' And they did. The swindler said that he
would think about it.
''He telephoned back about two minutes later and said he would
appear,'' recalls Sir David. ''It was sheer vanity on his part. He said
to me 'You polish your rapier and I'll polish mine'.''
The result made for stunning viewing. Savundra crossing swords with
Frost in front of an audience made up for the most part of the victims
of the Fire Auto and Marine swindle. Savundra was led like a lamb to the
slaughter. He was systematically destroyed by his interviewer. Frost,
almost without knowing it, had invented trial by television. And
Savundra was found guilty.
''I could never have predicted at the beginning of that programme that
it would turn out the way it did. It was a spontaneous confrontation in
the sense that he really made me annoyed. He said to me that he had
neither a legal nor a moral responsibility for these people and I said
that he may not have a legal responsibility, but he certainly had a
moral one,'' says Sir David.
The man across the coffee table, smoking the fat cigar, seems far
removed from the young interviewer who so comprehensively demolished
Savundra all those years ago. In between, of course, he's stalked the
mean streets of the global village -- the international dateline once
ensured that he hosted a show eight nights a week -- and made himself a
multi-millionaire in the process.
Name-dropping must be an occupational hazard. His latest scoop (and
one which any self-respecting broadcaster would have killed for) came
only last week when he grilled disgraced banker Nick Leeson in a German
prison. Okay, Leeson had good reason to talk when he did but you've got
to hand it to Sir David; it was he -- and no-one else -- who secured the
interview.
Over the years he's interviewed (deep breath) Wilson, Callaghan,
Heath, Thatcher, and Major; Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Ford, Carter, and
Nixon; Kissinger, Trudeau and Mulroney in Canada; Hawke, Fraser, and
Whitlam in Australia; Mandela and De Klerk in South Africa, Bobby
Kennedy, Indira Ghandi, Benazir Bhutto; King Hussein, Golda Meir, Moshe
Dayan, Menachem Begin, Yasser Arafat, and Yitzhak Rabin; out of politics
he's done Orson Welles, Tennessee Williams, Noel Coward, Woody Allen,
and the Beatles. And somewhere along the line he strayed off course to
make Through The Keyhole.
But can he still get angry? How sharp is the rapier these days? It is
surely a different, far more affable and mellower Frost who shares
Sunday Breakfast with the great and the good on BBC1.
''Well, the late John Smith said to me after one interview 'You have
the ability to ask beguiling questions with potentially lethal
consequences'. Now that is something I would be happy to be remembered
for,'' he declares. He believes that it is often better to drape a
question in colloquial clothes to a politician than it is to dress it up
in more formal attire.
''One would hope that I have evolved and perhaps become more
sophisticated. I still have some confrontations, usually when the facts
are being done a disservice, but I think I have developed more
techniques for trying to get to the facts and for trying to get someone
to reveal themselves more totally than before.
''One of the keys is to avoid the mock confrontation. Sometimes you
get people who huff and puff and think they're tough but don't have the
intellectual resources or the research to carry it off. You see, even a
question asked in a conversational manner can be much more difficult for
an interviewee to deal with. You can ask questions in all sorts of
ways,'' he adds.
Asked if, in these days of political spin doctors and PRs, it is more
difficult to deal with interviewees, he replies: ''You want your subject
to perform at their best in order to get the best possible interview.
They are more rehearsed and more sophisticated but that is just the
challenge and you have to work out a way of dealing with it.
''I've never known a politician to limit the areas or say things are
off-limits. If they did then you'd have to reject it. What they try to
do, of course, (and it is a free country) is change the subject after
one sentence.''
Sir David says that the objective for a political interviewer is not
so much to discuss the issues -- though they are important -- but to
give the public the opportunity of learning more about the people
involved.
''When you have a leader, whether it be an American President or a
British Prime Minister, it stands to reason that they can't lay out what
their policies would be in an emergency -- because, if they knew, then
it would not be an emergency. So it is very important to find out about
their character. It is not simply intellect; it is character and
judgment and you only form a view on character and judgment by getting
to know the people better.''
It will take more, much more, than an hour's interview to get to know
Sir David Frost. Fifty minutes into the meeting, he glances at his watch
and points out that we've got 10 minutes left. This is not so much a
signal for me to wind up; it is more a helpful warning, from one
interviewer to another, that we'd better get a move on if there are any
further questions to be asked. Sir David Frost is nothing if not the
consummate professional.

I AM astonished to read in Catherine Taylor's letter that clear, plain
English is the preserve of classicists, and that the withdrawal of
classics from the school curriculum has led to the ''vulgarisation'' of
language (September 19). This is intellectual arrogance of the highest
degree.
I would be extremely interested to hear your correspondent's views on
exactly what place the dative and ablative have in the understanding of
written or spoken English, and how the vast majority of English speakers
manage to communicate effectively without having the faintest clue what
they are.
While the study of any language, no matter how obscure or ancient, is
an excellent method of excercising the intellect, one cannot attempt to
prise the English language into a syntax created by classicists to
codify a dead language.
To say that a knowledge of Latin or Greek is the foundation of a
thorough understanding of English is to suggest that if you can sketch a
bicycle you could be a Formula One driver.

LET no-one tell you consensus in political life is impossible. On two
pretty fundamental things all three of the Westminster parties are a
chorus with one song, agreeing first that no modern government can hope
for real control of the economy; second, that the state cannot, probably
should not, try to do everything for its citizens.
These two assumptions -- for they have yet to achieve any greater
status -- are related in interesting ways. The first says that in an age
of global markets real freedom of economic action is limited, yet the
second argues that the functions of the state have real and deep
economic consequences.
A contradiction? Aside from causing sane people to wonder why they
should vote for anyone happy to admit that they cannot ever achieve very
much, this pair of superstitions have begun to change utterly the way
Britain is run. That they enjoy the faith of the main parties probably
says more, however, about political voodoo in Britain than about the
world in which, painfully, people struggle to get by.
Notice, for example, the tentative beginnings of an attempt to destroy
the welfare state. I say ''destroy'' rather than ''reform'' because not
one of the proposals currently floating around in the political ether
even pretends to extend the protection that the idea of state provision
implies. With an ageing population and a deep, dead pool of long-term
unemployment, the central idea, the only idea, is to get the people off
government's back.
There are good reasons to worry. On present trends social security
will be costing the taxpayer #100bn annually within a very few years.
Already, the NHS is running through #41bn a year. The Education
Secretary admits, meanwhile, that the schools system in England and
Wales needs more money, not less. Yet neither the Chancellor nor his
Shadow would even dream of admitting that taxes might just possibly have
to go up.
Kenneth Clarke's problem is straightforward: can he scrape together
the price of an electorate? Forget the growth in the public sector
borrowing requirement, or the fact that any cut will amount only to
part-compensation for previous increases, or that he risks deepening a
stubborn recession: when political duty calls, the economy can go
whistle.
But in such an adventure worries about the sustainability of the
welfare state are handy. The government that can plan for tax cuts is,
after all, also the government that is plotting ways to cut the welfare
bill.
While cuts might be needed to bring the Government's borrowing
requirement into line -- given that no-one bar the Liberal Democrats
dares to suggest putting taxes up -- the argument for reducing personal
taxation at the same time belongs to those who would sail the Forth in a
sieve. Yet watch Admiral Clarke make ready to cast off.
Two debates are thus conflated. The welfare crisis -- simply, too few
working people paying for too many non-working people -- is appropriated
by the pitiful victims of the Tory crisis. Hunting for money with which
to bribe its way out of trouble, the Government settles on a welfare
system in well-advertised difficulties about which Something Must Be
Done.
So we arrive at ''rationed'' NHS care, at universal, perhaps
compulsory, private pensions, at private health insurance, at
unemployment insurance, at a system in which the man from the Pru
replaces the man from the social and we all pretend to forget the
various private pension scams only recently revealed. Those among you
who imagined that National Insurance contributions have anything to do
with insurance are about to learn otherwise.
The simple question is this: how can any government, contemplating the
growing problems of the welfare state, even think about tax cuts? Since
the character of the present Government is well known, this hardly
requires an answer. But given the equivalent enthusiasm of certain of
Labour's leading lights for reforms that will shift the burden from the
state to individuals, we might also ask if society as a whole is really
prepared to abdicate responsibility for its weakest members.
If so, it makes all the fashionable talk about community sound more
than a little rich. Equally, given the obvious fact that a cure for the
blight of long-term unemployment is manifestly a cure for the problems
both of the welfare state and the economy, you begin to understand why
politicians are so keen to blame the invisible hand of global markets --
capitalism with knobs on -- for their own failures.
Put people back to work, in other words, and every negative becomes a
plus. Pretend that the economy is out of your hands and you invite,
wittingly or not, the degradation of society.

I HAVE to admit that I am a novice on the Net. But spurred on by the
lure of instantaneous communication and by the innovation of a few
dedicated SNP members who have created a World-Wide Web Page for the
party that the Financial Times described yesterday as ''probably the
best British political party page . . . well organised and full of
interesting links'', I have now arranged an e-mail subscription for my
office that will be active by the time Parliament resumes. With it comes
a link to the Internet.
Moreover, all my parliamentary and Euro-parliamentary colleagues have
also taken the plunge, which will ensure that we can take the accolade
of the ''most wired political party'' from the Lib Dems when Westminster
resumes.
When I do finally get the opportunity regularly to surf the
information superhighway, I am sure I will turn quickly to what others
in politics present about themselves. One of the most visited sites in
the world is the virtual tour of the White House, complete with messages
from Bill Clinton and Al Gore. Of slightly less popular appeal is the
simultaneous transmission via the Internet of all the proceedings of the
Norwegian Parliament, and if those get a little tedious, you can zoom
off by the click of a mouse to a map of the Japanese Diet, complete with
details of the protocols of the House.
Most of the US presidential hopefuls have home pages now, and because
the Net is free of censorship, Bob Dole has even attracted a second page
which satirises his ambitions. You can pray with Pat Buchanan and read
the announcement of their intention to run from half a dozen other
candidates whose names are not even a household word in their own
states, let alone 3000 miles away.
But as American politicians rarely do anything without an eye on
electoral support, the involvement of so many -- with sophisticated
tools to allow response, registration of support, and donation of money
-- indicates that the Internet is more than a hobby for insomniacs or
the anorak-wearing computer addict.
There are hundreds of millions of people who now have the capability
of accessing the whole world of information that the Internet provides.
For researchers it can cut down time and increase resources -- the
United Nations database is just one example of a huge reservoir of
important facts which is instantly accessable.
Business advertises on, and uses, the Net and some Scottish businesses
are to be found at the cutting edge. Certainly there is a great deal of
less than serious import, but for politicians a cheap method of
disseminating information, a first port of call for those who want
information on the party, an opportunity for casual access and learning,
and a direct method for those interested to contact and become enrolled
are all boons which the Internet can provide.
The Internet is also a regulation-free zone, and an absolute democracy
where one view and one access is as important as another. It is perhaps
no surprise therefore that the only UK political party not represented
as yet is the Tory party -- although Labour and Liberal are represented
as ever from London, with one e-mail address a piece to link inquirers
to Scotland.
The lack of interest from the Tories is mirrored in their attitude to
access by the Net to British democratic institutions. Most Government
departments have some sort of page -- although the Scottish Office is
bizarrely represented by an offer of free pamphlets that you have to
send for by snail mail (an Internet term for what comes through our
letter boxes) and a grainy black and white photograph of St Andrew's
House, looking like a Romanian state building before the fall of
Ceausescu. But democratic institutions don't rate a mention -- search
for the term ''Parliament'' in one of the electronic on-line browsers
and you can find Australia, Canada, Norway, and Japan -- but not the
so-called mother of them all.
Labour's offering to date has been, like the party, all style and no
substance. Its idea of current issues is a discussion on the Tory
leadership, now almost three months old. But in keeping with ''New
Labour'' ideology it has re-invented itself in the last week and
promises a ''virtual conference'' on line, allowing the world to travel
by fibre optics to Brighton for an electronic away day.
The samplers already released for this extravaganza feature, as ever,
a toothy Tony Blair inviting you to wander into the ''virtual bar'',
question Shadow Cabinet members in ''virtual fringe'', and eavesdrop on
the speeches in the ''virtual conference''. You can, it is clearly
implied, influence the future of the country just by dialling in.
New Labour of course prefers presentation to policies, but I can't
help thinking that investing all this time and energy in its electronic
conference is not only unwise but also deceitful. The SNP's on-line
pages have policy aplenty, along with links to other Scottish pages and
even our conference agenda. But in developing this service I want to see
real people being given real information and having real opportunities
to influence (as members) real change. Waving the magic wand of virtual
reality may be possible in computing, but it can never be a substitute
for political action by political activists.
When I get up to speak on Friday my speech will simultaneously be
available in text form on the Internet. Next year it may even be
available in sound. During our conference our chief executive will be
taking part in an on-line question and answer session for thousands of
subscribers throughout the world. That's giving and sharing information.
But in our real hall, and our real fringe, and even in our real bar,
people will be taking part and influencing our party and our future. To
pretend that it can all be done with mirrors, terminals, and glitzy
graphics is a denial of democracy, not an enhancement of it.
The Internet, with all it offers, has great potential for political
parties and even greater potential for humanity. It does herald a new
age of information and openness. That's why the SNP is so enthusiastic,
for our present age has been one of prejudice, secrecy, and lack of
fairness.
But it can't and won't take over our rights and duties as
participating citizens. You have to be there if you really want to
change our country and our society for the better.
You can't have virtual justice and virtual freedom -- you've got to
have the real thing!

<HEADLINE>Major vetoes benefit switch. Business to be spared #450m maternity bill.</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>BENEDICT BROGAN, POLITICAL REPORTER</BYLINE>

THE Prime Minister has vetoed a scheme to switch maternity benefit
from the State to employers, an annual bill of #450m.
Mr Major is launching his new initiative to help small business
tomorrow, and he will not stand for such an additional burden on them.
The Treasury scheme, part of a mammoth exercise to cut State spending
to allow for tax cuts in the November Budget, was discussed at a Cabinet
sub-committee with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in the chair.
A leak of this discussion yesterday promoted a violent reaction from
both business and unions, and the Prime Minister has moved swiftly to
kill this political embarrassment.
His Chancellor may be allowed to find other ways of saving money on
maternity benefits in his Budget, but it will not be foisted on
employers.
The Government is desperate to find ways of trimming the #85bn spent
annually on social security. But Mr Major has evidently recoiled from a
proposal shown by yesterday's widespread protests to be politically
dangerous.
Labour threatened to mount a campaign on the scale of its successful
defeat of the second tranche of VAT on fuel last year, but stopped short
of committing itself to reversing such a cut if it comes to power.
The proposal, which would have switched responsibility for funding
maternity pay to the employers, could have affected 275,000 working
mothers a year.
The British Chamber of Commerce warned businesses would seek to avoid
the extra cost by taking on fewer women employees.
Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman said Labour would ''seek
the support of businesses, unions, and organisations concerned with
children and families in our campaign''.
Right-wing Tory MP David Shaw, a member of both the Commons social
security committee and the Tory back-bench finance committee, criticised
the idea as ''ludicrous''.
''I would be very surprised if this is an area where people are
seriously expecting there to be cuts in public expenditure. It doesn't
reduce the overall cost to the economy because somebody's got to pay the
benefit. Maternity benefits are an accepted cost of society,'' he said.
Under recently introduced European legislation, women qualify for 18
weeks' statutory benefit after just six months with the same employer.
They receive 90% of their earnings for the first six weeks and #52.50 a
week for the remaining three months.
Labour Social Security spokesman Donald Dewar said: ''Already
Statutory Sick Pay costs have been passed to industry and there are
hints that Industrial Injuries Benefit will soon follow. So much for the
crocodile tears about the difficulties facing small businesses. It is
all part of a shameless transfer designed to make room for a giveaway
budget.''
For the Liberal Democrats, social security spokesperson Liz Lynne
said: ''If this crazy idea was ever introduced all women of child
bearing age will be considered a financial liability to employ. The
progress that women have made in the workplace will be set back for
decades by this proposal.''
TUC general secretary John Monks said it would be ''a tax on women's
jobs''.
The Royal College of Midwives warned it would cause pregnant women
needless stress with ''unforeseen consequences for the mental and
physical health of the mother and unborn child''.
The Confederation of British Industry said it was firmly opposed to
businesses taking on the burden of funding the benefit. ''Such a move
will raise employment costs across business, but particularly in areas
which employ large numbers of women such as retailing, hotel and
leisure,'' a spokesman said.
The shopworkers' union, Usdaw, said such a move would discourage small
businesses from employing women of child-bearing age and would encourage
large employers to retreat from maternity packages which went beyond the
statutory minimum.

THE career which a man in his thirties coveted so much that he chose
to pass himself off as a teenager at school and university to realise
his goal has finally been put out of his reach because of deceit.
Brian MacKinnon, a 33-year-old who took on a new identity as a
17-year-old schoolboy and student last year, was due to embark on a
medical degree programme for the third time next month at Dundee
University.
But the university all but closed the door on the lifelong ambition of
a man said to be desperate to become a doctor. A university official
asked yesterday: ''If he is prepared to lie his way on to a course, can
he be trusted in such matters as writing prescriptions?
''It raises all kinds of ethical questions. If he has falsified
documents, termination of his studies is an option being considered. The
university takes a very firm line about the conduct and honesty of its
medical students.''
MacKinnon has been summoned by university authorities to explain his
actions after it emerged that he had passed himself off as a 17 year old
named Brandon Lee and spent a year as a fifth-year pupil at Bearsden
Academy, a magnet secondary near Glasgow.
As Lee, he gained five As in his Highers in 1994 and was admitted to
study medicine at Dundee University, where he was an undergraduate
between October and December last year before dropping out for personal
reasons.
But it also emerged yesterday that he had attended Bearsden Academy in
the 1970s as Brian MacKinnon and had secured a place at Glasgow
University in 1980, also to study medicine, after obtaining four A and
two B passes in his Highers.
He dropped out after three years but returned to the university in
1986. He successfully completed an honours science course in 1989 but
did not graduate from the university.
MacKinnon, who has gone to ground, reappeared at Bearsden Academy in
1993 as Brandon Lee. His deceit came to light only after the present
school session began last month.
The Bearsden Academy headteacher, Mr Norman MacLeod, received a
telephone call from a concerned parent who would not give her name but
who passed on information about Lee.
Stories also began circulating among senior pupils about Lee
possessing two passports with two identities and ages. Mr MacLeod
investigated the matter and spoke to Lee about 10 days ago. He passed on
his findings to Strathclyde region's education department.
Lee recently went on holiday to Tenerife with two female former
classmates. It has been reported that he had been involved in a fracas,
which led to the discovery of the passports on the Spanish holiday
island.
But the father of one of the girls on the holiday said last night
that, to the best of his knowledge, Lee had not been arrested in a pub
brawl in Tenerife and that the issue of the two passports had not come
to light on that occasion.
Strathclyde Police said yesterday that, to date, it had not begun an
investigation. The Herald has learned, however, that the Passport Office
in Glasgow yesterday had an inquiry from the police asking for
information.
Sources said passport fraud, particularly involving visitors'
passports, was not as rare as might be expected. Concern about the
integrity of British visitors' passports will lead this month to a
termination of issues for Spain and the Spanish islands.
More than two million BVPs are issued each year. In Scotland people
with a false passport can be charged with obtaining a document by
deception or uttering a fraudulent document.
Strathclyde region education officials said yesterday that Bearsden
Academy had been blameless in the affair. MacKinnon had returned to the
school, saying he had returned from Canada and was living with his
grandmother, whose Bearsden address was checked by the school.
The senior deputy director of education, Mr David Alexander, said:
''We are satisfied that the headteacher acted in good faith.'' But the
authority is introducing measures to ensure that such a case cannot
happen again.
Craig Hepburn, 17, a former pupil at the school, said: ''He once was
in class with one of my friends and he actually said he remembered when
Elvis died and we wondered how that could be.''
The man's mother, 70-year-old Mrs May MacKinnon, was yesterday said to
be highly distressed.
A police spokesman said: ''She doesn't know where her son is and she
is in tears.''
Sixth-year pupil Kathryn Booth said: ''I think it's creepy and scary
that a 32 year old got into the school.''

THE disposal last month of a hunk of its shoe shops was regarded as a
positive step by Sears in its game plan, initiated some years ago, to
tighten up its sprawling shoe empire into something more cohesive and
competitive.
Yesterday's poor first-half figures and the drop in like-for-like
sales since the half-year does not negate this.
The revamping of the British Shoe Corporation outlets is now expected
to be completed by the middle of next year -- some 18 months ahead of
schedule which is all to the good.
The problem with Sears is that shareholders have been waiting a long
time for the company to get its act together and there have been plenty
of disappointments along the way.
It is not alone, though, in suffering in the High Street and certainly
the outcome for August, when like-for-like sales tumbled 10%, can
largely be blamed on the exceptionally hot weather influencing people in
the type of goods they bought. Clothing and shoes were not priorities.
That said, while there has been some improvement in September, there is
still a 6% decline so far in the second half.
The company is hoping for a consumer pick-up in the last quarter but
this cannot be guaranteed and the outcome for the full year is rightly
being viewed with caution. Earlier full-year profit expectations in the
market have naturally been curtailed.
Sears will need to prove that its new format works and there have been
some encouraging pointers here, though only Selfridges appears to have
completely countered the sluggishness seen elsewhere.
Suggestions of further streamlining through divestment of Miss
Selfridge and Wallis operations brought no response except that the
company was not in conversation with anyone. However, this clearly
cannot be ruled out.
Meanwhile, chief executive Liam Strong is talking about steady
progress in the second half and into next year. But Sears still needs an
upturn in consumer spending to generate sales growth.

BRITAIN won a promise from Croatia yesterday to halt military
offensives in western Bosnia, raising hopes of an eventual peace.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind emerged delighted from talks with
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb and said the commitment gave
a vital impetus to the peace process.
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic also said his government
believed it was now time to end the fighting and reach a final and just
peace.
Croat forces, together with Bosnian Croats and Muslims, have swept
aside Serb resistance in western Bosnia in a series of offensives that
threatened to derail the peace process and create a humanitarian
disaster.
The Croat and Muslim forces were reported to be less than 30 miles
from the Serb stronghold town of Banja Luka. They were also poised
around the strategic Serb town of Prijedor, although reports it had been
captured were denied by Serbs from within the town itself.
Mr Rifkind warned President Tudjman there was a real danger that
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic might find it impossible not to
intervene and send in his army to help the Serb population if attacks
towards Banja Luka continued.
''There must always be a risk that Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro
-- may feel the need to be drawn in,'' he said.
''I don't think they wish to do that. President Milosevic gave a very
clear impression that he would see that as a disaster for the peace
process and other objectives.
''But we are also aware that within Belgrade there are great pressures
of a different kind and there must be a degree of uncertainty as to what
the consequences might be.''

TESCO chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin was ruminating yesterday that he had
started in the business in 1959 unloading lorries at the company's
Cheshunt headquarters.
He is retiring in two years and is handing over what is now accepted
as Britain's most successful supermarket business in terms of sales to
an as yet undisclosed successor.
While the perception is that Tesco has transformed itself only in the
last three or four years, he argued that the process started as far back
as 1977 when it stopped handing out Green Shield stamps as a customer
inducement.
It has been very successful with its marketing initiatives,
culminating -- so far -- with the Clubcard and its first progeny the
Studentcard which is available at 75 universities. There has been a
costly price tag on this of some #30m in the first part of the year, but
it has led to both increased sales and customer loyalty, while showing
an initiative that competitors only now are trying to follow and some
only half heartedly.
But there is a time and a season for all managements, with Sainsbury
now appearing to have passed its peak and institutional dissent
beginning to make itself heard. Anecdotal evidence is is that it has
lost its way and had become tired. And dare one say, that is echoed to a
lesser extent at Safeway?
Inflation has been the traditional support for maintaining and
widening supermarket margins, but these seem likely to remain under
intense pressure over the next couple of years as commodity prices ease.
The only real solution is to attract ever greater customer numbers and
persuade them to spend more on each trip -- the Tesco transformation at
Wm Low is startling evidence of how it should be done and, in
retrospect, tears shed at the time of the acquisition were unnecessary.

THESE days it seems that you can't blow your nose without someone
recording it and putting it on their file.
One-side effect of the spread of information technology into all walks
of life is that personal details that would once have been the preserve
of one organisation can now easily be relayed to a third party.
There are those who say that people with nothing to hide have nothing
to fear from having all their private details held on computer. This is
one argument put forward by those in favour of national identity cards.
However, I am not so sure that it is desirable to have no privacy as far
as the state is concerned.
One group that likes to get its hands on as much information about us
as possible are retailers and advertising agencies. Given the wide range
of products on the market and consumers' reluctance to spend, both of
these groups are keen to promote their wares to a particular target
audience.
Several companies exist whose entire raison d'etre is to collate
information on households which is then sold onto groups such as
retailers.
CCN is one such company. It is probably best known for its credit
reference work. If you are refused a credit card it is quite likely that
CCN or one of its rivals will have had something to do with the
decision.
Given its huge database it is not surprising that it has sought to
make further commercial use of its information-gathering techniques in
the form of specific marketing products.
One such product is Mosaic whose premise works on the basis that
people of a particular kind tend to cluster in certain neighbourhoods, a
subject known as geodemographics. However, this is not a perfect
science.
The gentrification phenomenon of the late 1980s' property boom, for
instance, when so called ''up and coming'' areas were inhabited by the
middle classes, may have thrown the profiling out of kilter in some
individual cases.
However, by using a variety of datasources including the national
Census, Post Office and electoral records, an ''accurate'' picture of a
neighbourhood and a persons likely spending habits can be ascertained.
Having my postcode put into the computer it was rather alarming to see a
print-out map of my road with house profiles and synopsis of residents.
A Mosaic system has been devised for Scotland which broadly groups the
population into ten categories based on dwelling: high income areas,
middle income owners, low-income owners, better off council,
disadvantaged council estates, families in council flats, renting
singles, singles and flats, country dwellers and institutional areas.
Each of the ten categories is then further broken down for more
effective targeting. For instance, the high income areas category is
disaggregated into six further groups: monied society, designer
development, upmarket families, ageing professionals, wealthy greys and
stable couples.
The description of monied society gives a taste of the kind of
assumptions that are made and with it suggests the kind of junk mail you
will receive.
The type Monied Society contains established areas of mostly large
detached housing often inhabited by company directors and other business
elites. These are family areas where well educated, professional parents
are middle-aged and where children are likely to be at university.
Although often found within easy reach of city centres rather than in
remote areas, people in this type are thought probably to have two or
three cars and high disposable incomes enabling them to enjoy the finer
things in life. They are thought likely to be patrons of the arts
enjoying cultural activities and to be readers of the quality press such
as The Herald.
Such a post-code related marketing aid is just one of a range of tools
used by retailers to decide where to site their developments. A location
that's appropriate for a Marks &amp; Spencer food store is unlikely to be
the same as one for a Kwik Save.
Personally, I try to avoid filling in customer service questionnaires
and am a member of the Mailing Preference Service which is supposed to
prevent junk mail from being delivered. It is harder to avoid some of
the wheezes dreamt up to try to entice one to spend in superstores
unless one resorts to wearing a mask, goggles and earplugs which would
make buying even the essentials rather difficult.

HORSESHOE manufacturers at the turn of the century said the car was
coming but would not affect them. Happily a few still remain, but they
have only small specialised markets.
Taylor Woodrow is in danger of being seen as being in the same mould
and, unhappily, it is far from being alone. Chairman Colin Parsons who
has achieved a huge amount in stabilising a company that was going into
a tail-spin laid out the stark facts of the UK construction industry.
He said margins were virtually non-existent and that there was not
going to be any change for a number of years with volume decreasing.
The Private Finance Initiative was ''obviously constipated'' and was
not working. Ironically, Eurotunnel co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton has
resigned as head of that body.
PFI is successful in some countries such as Malaysia -- which has
something to teach its former colonial masters about the commercial
realities of the modern world. The Kuala Lumpur Light Transit Railway is
one such initiative where Taylor Woodrow has an equity stake. But PFI
appears to be a lost cause in Britain at present.
It seems strange that faced with the facts that UK general contracting
is unprofitable and will remain so, the company wants to stay in the
activity. Yet Mr Parsons was adamant -- ''we don't want to get out'' --
and seems to be relying on reducing costs as the solution.
He opined that the company had not been tough enough in the past and
there was likely to be more bloodshed in time. But why waste management
effort when there are much better opportunities overseas?
Unfortunately, as major rivals such as Wimpey are prepared to concede,
industry rationalisation is necessary, but they are not prepared to quit
what is seen as the most macho public activity.
Perhaps it is time the banks and major shareholders started applying
pressure -- otherwise the reality of trading losses could result in the
survival of just a few weakened participants.

CLINTON Cards is expanding its share of the greetings card and
accessories market with the acquisition of 112 shops from Carlton Cards
for #3.25m. Fixtures and fittings account for #500,000 of the cost and
the remainder is mainly attributable to stock, writes NICOLA REEVES.
Clinton is paying just under #1.4m in cash for the shops and is
issuing Carlton with 1.7 million Clinton shares at 110p each, worth
#1.87m.
Nine of the outlets purchased are in Scotland, with two operating in
Glasgow. Nineteen are in Wales where Clinton Cards currently has little
representation.
Carlton is a major UK publisher and distributor of greetings cards and
associated products and is Clinton's second largest supplier. Carlton
shops operate under a number of trade names including Thoughts,
Greetings, Card Craft and Sentiments. It is a subsidiary of American
Greetings Corporation, which is one of the world's largest publishers
and distributors of greetings cards and associated products.
In the year to end February, the Carlton Shops had an estimated
turnover of #20m and made a loss of #700,000. Last year, Clinton
acquired the retail outlets of its major supplier, Hallmark.
Accompanying news of the acquisition was an interim results statement
showing an increase in the half-time loss. This was expected because
Clinton typically makes most of its profits in the run-up to Christmas.
Underlying sales rose by 5% helped by increased sales of card and gift
wrap and improvements in gift merchandise and ancillary lines.
Clinton ended the period with 372 shops compared with 277 last year.
However, following the acquisition and proposed new store openings it
expects to end the current financial year with 485.
The UK greetings card market is high margin but intensely competitive.
The major food retailing superstores and Boots have recently entered it
alongside the established players.
Clinton's trading in the six weeks since July 30 was said to be poor
with sales down 2% due to the prolonged spell of hot weather. Clinton
shares rose 3p to 99p.

LIBERAL Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown yesterday threw down the
gauntlet to Tony Blair to move on to Liberal Democrat ground if he
wanted co-operation between the two parties.
Demanding a clear commitment from Mr Blair to transforming Britain's
first-past-the-post voting system, Mr Ashdown told cheering activists at
his party's annual conference in Glasgow that the cherished Liberal
Democrat policy of proportional representation was ''not an optional
extra, but absolutely integral''.
In a clear echo of the ''come and get me, I'm sure of what I stand
for'' theme that has dominated the conference, he used his keynote
speech to leave Mr Blair in no doubt that there would have to be
substantial changes to Labour's stance over a range of policy issues if
the two were to work together.
Mr Ashdown and his senior colleagues have been angered this week by
what they perceive as an attempt by Labour to hijack their conference --
stealing their policies if not trying to steal their votes.
Yesterday he had marginally harsher things to say about the Tories
than he did about Labour, but left his supporters in no doubt that there
still was clear blue water between the Lib Dems and the two main
parties.
In a move designed to mock Labour, he sent a dismissive postcard to Mr
Blair in which he said: ''Dear Tony, having a wonderful time in Glasgow.
Thanks for the message. . . We've always believed in working with others
where we agree, but first you must be clear where you stand. We are --
let us know when you are.''
Mr Ashdown said he was glad Mr Blair had confirmed Labour's commitment
to a referendum on fair votes, but that did not go far enough.
Taunting the Labour leader, he said: ''It is not leadership to ask
others to decide, when you won't decide yourself. Holding a referendum
is not an alternative to holding an opinion.''
The attacks on the other two parties then came thick and fast.
''Labour won't confront the issues because they're frightened they'll
scare the electorate,'' he said. ''The Conservatives won't confront them
because they're frightened they'll divide their party.
''If we Liberal Democrats are not prepared to face the facts then
no-one will. If we don't say it, it won't be said. If we don't do it, it
won't be done. Now that's more than a role, that's a responsibility. It
is our duty. To make sure that the next Government does not duck the
decisions it must take if Britain is to be a success again.
''The first change Britain needs is a change of Government. This
Government must go, and every vote and every seat we win will see it
does go.''
Labour, however, was accused of going back on the concept of
constitutional reform. Mr Ashdown said: ''I had hoped that Labour, like
us, would stand firm on this. Instead they seem half-hearted, timid,
even in retreat.''
''
On the Lib Dem pledge to raise taxes to fund extra spending on
education and to vote against any Tory ''tax bribes'' in the Budget, Mr
Ashdown said: ''To Labour I say simply this. Join us. For once leave
your caution at the doors of the division lobbies and vote with us for
Britain's schools, Britain's pupils, Britain's future.''
On railways, he said: ''Join us. Join us in the pledge (to retain
Railtrack in public control).''
The Liberal Democrat leader made clear his belief that his party could
be a force for change in the system.
''Within the next 18 months, perhaps before we meet again, we will be
called upon to show that we have the courage and the firm answers and
the strong vision to be the lever of change, the guarantee of change.
Let them say of us -- that was their challenge and they rose to it.''

ANDREW Cubie, the new chairman of CBI Scotland, wants Scottish
industry to become more competitive by improving education and training
and embracing new technology with open arms.
But Mr Cubie, a 49-year-old corporate lawyer, plans to steer a neutral
course on the thorny issue of devolution.
''We will involve ourselves in the public policy discussions, but not
in the party political discussions,'' he told a news conference in
Glasgow yesterday which was called to set out priorities for his
two-year term.
Mr Cubie, who took over as chairman from John Ward earlier this month,
said he planned to follow up the Scottish Business Agenda launched by
his predecessor.
This is a strategy framework for reviving the Scottish economy, which
was worked out by CBI Scotland earlier this year in consultation with
other business organisations, trade unions, academics and the political
parties.
The CBI now plans to draw up action plans to address specific issues
in the Scottish Business Agenda.
Mr Cubie said he would lead a delegation to Brussels shortly to bring
this initiative to the attention of the European Union authorities.
He believes Scotland must become more competitive on a world stage and
treat other EU countries as a simple extension of the domestic market.
But to do this Scotland must improve education and training and adopt
new technology with open arms.
''We have to embrace new technology. Change at one level is very
threatening, but at another level very rewarding,'' he said.
Mr Cubie also wants to chisel away at Scottish prejudices against
making money through business. ''We have to create a culture where
people actually want to be entrepreneurs,'' he said.
A more immediate task is to find a replacement for Lex Gold, the
much-praised director of CBI Scotland, who is quitting for new and more
lucrative challenges after less than two years in the job.
The new deputy chairman of the CBI in Scotland is Brian Fitzgerald, a
49-year-old civil engineer with 27 years experience in the construction
industry with firms such as Alfred MacAlpine and John Laing.
He sees a particular need for Scottish business to tackle
environmental issues and make sure they are properly debated and
understood before projects go ahead.
The construction of the M77 motorway around the southern outskirts of
Glasgow, which has provoked so much protest, is a striking example of
where this failed to happen.
''We want to try and find a way so that the environmental pressures
which are all around us are brought into play at an earlier stage,'' Mr
Fitzgerald said.
Mr Cubie, who is a senior partner with the Edinburgh-based law firm
Fyfe Ireland, said the CBI would not adopt an attitude for or against
devolution, although it would encourage individual member companies to
speak out for themselves.
The CBI itself would merely demand that proponents and opponents of a
Scottish parliament spell out how their ideas would benefit Scottish
business. ''We are going to stick to our own knitting,'' he said.

EMPLOYEES face higher stress levels as a result of almost perpetual
reorganisation in the workplace and the ever-increasing use of
information technology, it was claimed yesterday.
Facilities management company Workplace Management believes the
results of a Gallup survey which it commissioned suggest that workers
will have to endure greater stress.
The survey of chief executives and financial directors of 200 UK
companies, the results of which were published yesterday, reveals that
51% of companies reorganise at least once a year to meet market needs.
Some 80% of companies believe they may have to alter current working
practices to meet market change. And 85% of companies expect to have to
explore new technologies in order to compete.
However, Lex Gold, director of CBI Scotland, said the rapid advance in
technology gives Scottish companies a unique opportunity to secure a
greater share of world markets.
And Donald Hardie, director of the 2000-strong Scottish division of
the Institute of Directors, was disappointed that only 51% of companies
reorganised at least once a year to meet market needs.
He said: ''Unless a company responds to market changes it is dead.
That figure of 51% is rather low.''
Meanwhile, London-based Workplace Management, a subsidiary of
information technology group ICL, was critical of the fact that 54% of
companies did not consider employee satisfaction important enough to
measure through regular research.
Touching on the content of CBI Scotland's Manufacturing Matters
report, published last autumn, Mr Gold said: ''We believe that Scotland
is well placed to take advantage of the development of the information
technology highways.
''We have been promoting that idea. We are also promoting the idea
that our youngsters are introduced to that (technology) at the earliest
possible opportunity in schools.''
He added that the only constant in the modern business world was
change, which was necessary to compete in world markets.
Mr Gold said stress could be avoided by introducing changes in
partnership with the workforce, which could even lead the advances.
Mr Hardie considered it vital to explain the reasons for and the
implications of the change to employees, as soon as management had made
its decision.
He said shorter work spells and other simple factors, such as adequate
lighting, good seating and the correct temperature, were important in
the alleviation of stress.
Mr Hardie said: ''The management has got to run its affairs in such a
way that its staff is able to keep up and do its job properly.
''You can't do that if stress is beginning to tell and people are
getting more tired and more irritable and breaking down.''

APROPOS the current verbal gymnastics on the part of both main
political parties about the relevance or otherwise of leaked documents,
is it naive to hope that, as a first step towards regaining some degree
of respect and credibility in the eyes of the electorate, the respective
leaders might state publicly and as a matter of policy that they will
neither accept nor make use of information passed to them anonymously
and which has clearly been obtained by dishonest or discreditable means
or as a result of breach of trust?
Trafficking in any commodity, be it drugs or information, will soon
cease if the outlet for it no longer exists. But let's not hold our
breath!

I WONDER exactly when it was that John Carlyle (September 14) found
his student's grant adequate to support himself, his wife, and two
children.
He would certainly find life as a married student much more difficult
nowadays as the Government engages in a programme of progressively
cutting grants and other state benefits to students, while enticing them
into debt via student loans.
Having worked for less than he could have freely obtained from the
state, Mr Carlyle is due congratulation on his sense of self-respect and
social responsibility.
Unfortunately the same cannot be said of his selfish, ''stuff you,
Jack'' gesture involving his employer's fully laden lorry and its keys.
I would imagine that this particular episode must have taken place in a
bygone age, when alternative employment was fairly easily obtained.
Were Mr Carlyle to behave in such a cavalier manner in 1995, modern
anti-labour legislation would leave him exposed to the possibility of
punitive legal action initiated by his employer for breach of contract,
loss of income, and neglect of company property. Also the enforcers of
the Road Traffic Acts might feel compelled to issue him with an
invitation to help them with their various inquiries.
John Carlyle is, of course, factually correct when he states that
no-one need remain in a job they dislike. He might even be correct in
saying that the solution to some of James Mulholland's problems lies in
the avoidance of running up bills.
Mr Carlyle could have gone even further and suggested that those who
find themselves discontentedly trapped, either as wage slaves or pension
prisoners, in boring, low-paid jobs, should simply opt out of the
irritating diversion of paying for mortgages, rents, fuel and clothing.
This would allow them the leisure time to follow the advice he gave to
Mr Mulholland, to participate in those things which cost nothing.
Absolute freedom from the need of money could then be achieved by
punctuating Mr Carlyle's suggested museum-musings and
riverbank-ramblings with daily grazing sessions in Kelvingrove Park and
on Glasgow Green.

I WRITE with reference to your article of September 4, Casualties of
debt, and additionally the letter entitled Careers starting with debt
(September 15).
Both of these contained a very important factual inaccuracy, namely
that the basic salary of a medical graduate is #18,000. The proper
figure is published weekly in the British Medical Journal and in fact
stands at #13,930 a year (40-hour week).
In addition, junior doctors must work overnight -- this means on
average an extra 32 hours per week. During the pre-registration year,
many of these hours are spent performing routine after-hours work and
not ''on call'' for emergencies.
This does not, however, double the aforementioned salary, as most
junior doctors are paid at only 50% of their normal rate of pay for
after-hours work.
This gives a figure of around #3.50 per hour, which is lower than the
proposed minimum wage suggested by the U.K.
I agree with William McKechnie's comment that many years of training
and financial hardship are a problem faced by many young graduates in a
variety of professions. However, on the above evidence I would still
conclude that junior hospital doctors are a special case.

I AM in receipt of an expensive letter from the director of finance,
Central Superannuation Office, informing me that from September, 15,
1995, my monthly pension, net, would be #33.89. My current pension is
#33.88.
A huge increase, which I was ''overjoyed'' to be informed of.

YOUR correspondent Matthew Smith (Why Yes might really mean No --
September 13) asks, rhetorically I suspect, how do other correspondents
know that ''a clear majority of Scots want a parliament to legislate''.
He asks: ''Where is the evidence? Opinion polls? Voting patterns? Surely
not.''
Surely so. Opinion polls and voting patterns over the last two
decades, and another this year, showed that the vast majority of Scots
wanted devolution of taxing and spending policy to a regional assembly
in Scotland.
Further, as I reported to the MORI Scotland seminar on September 11,
the latest detailed survey of Scottish opinion on constitutional issues,
carried out by MORI for the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, showed that
80% of Scots said they wanted a referendum on devolution to Scotland and
only 16% opposed it.
Perhaps more surprisingly, 54% of people in England said there should
be such a referendum with only 25% opposed. Throughout Britain, a
majority of Conservative supporters wish to see such a referendum held.
When asked ''If a majority in Scotland voted on a referendum in favour
of a separate Scottish Assembly, with same taxation and spending
policies, do you think they should be allowed one or not?'', by
eight-to-one the Scots, and by four-to-one the English, said that it
should be honoured. Twenty-nine per cent of Scots say they are in favour
of independence and 52% a separate assembly; only 17% wish to see no
change.
This has been shown in many opinion polls. What is perhaps new about
the JRRT/MORI findings is that among people in England, 14% would wish
to see an independent Scotland and a majority, 51% a Scottish Assembly.
Only a quarter of the English wish to see no change. Disappointingly
for the Scots, no doubt, is that this minority includes the Prime
Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland.

IT would appear from Ken Smith's report, ''Scottish Office paid #21.5m
to consultants'' (September 18), that there is no shortage of public
money when it comes to finding ways of selling off public assets. It
would be interesting to know if the appointments of the consultants were
on the basis of competitive tendering and if not why not?

I MIGHT quarrel, though not too stridently, with Catherine Traynor's
belief that a classical education was necessary for good written and
spoken English or any other language but she has a valuable point
(September 15).
The rot is everywhere in television, radio, and the schools, to say
nothing of official documents. I have seen on a blackboard in a
well-known seat of education an instruction urging the pupils, ''Take
care when your drawing the perpendicular'', and the teacher could not
see what was wrong when I pointed out the error.
Hardly a day goes by but someone ''headbutts'' someone else. Butting
means striking with the head and I cannot butt with my buttocks or any
other part of my anatomy, as ''youse'' must all agree, but I got no
reply from those who earn more in a year than I did in a lifetime, when
I wrote to GMTV.
I must apologise for my failure to incorporate ''so I did!'' in every
sentence in this letter. It shows that I have a fat chance of
''earning'' #600,000 a year, so it does, but I am learning fast!

MICHAEL Fry's article, Rushdie and the odour of sanctity (September
13), treated an important subject in a very frivolous way. The fatwa
against Rushdie is a direct challenge to British sovereignty and a
denial of the fundamental values of modern Western European democracy.
A foreign head of state called on his followers to assassinate an
author who was and is a citizen of another country. This call was backed
up by funds given to professional hit men. As a result, people
associated with Rushdie were murdered in countries far away from Iran,
and Rushdie himself has lived under the threat of death ever since.
Michael Fry is by no means the first British right-winger to attempt
to personalise and trivialise this major issue of principle. Very soon
after the fatwa was announced Mr Norman Tebbit (as he then was) called
Rushdie ''a nasty little man''.
Fry perpetuates the idea that there is no major issue of principle
involved when he alleges that Rushdie's personality is of central
importance to the people who feel strongly about the issue, describing
them as ''a modern equivalent of a local cult of saints''.
Fry goes on to write: ''With hindsight we can see that the faithful
were gulled. I suspect that future generations will reach much the same
conclusion about Rushdie's martyrdom, if it is remembered at all''.
I am quite sure that future generations will see the conflict between
the Western European ideal of a liberal democratic society and the
dictatorial attitudes of religious fundamentalists as one of the
important issues of our times.
The fatwa against Rushdie will be remembered in that context and it
will provide historians with a yardstick to judge whether ''the
liberalism of British society'' is indeed ''absolutely genuine'' or ''an
imperialist sham''.

IN the best ''king's-new-clothes'' tradition, Alan Dunlop of the
Glasgow Institute of Architects brings a fresh air of reality to the
ongoing debate about Glasgow's future development.
Well might he ask can Glasgow rise to the challenge of 1999 when
councillors and quangos propose such preposterous ideas as the #250m M74
extension instead of a modern public transport system, the #80m
titivated business park for Pacific Quay, or the out-of-town shopping
mall at Braehead.
Much was made of participation by local organisations and individuals
in Glasgow's bid for City of Architecture and Design in 1999. And on
October 26 Councillor Pat Lally, who notably championed the campaign,
will put forward his ideas on this at a public meeting in the Adelaide
Church Centre to be held by the New Glasgow Society.
Hopefully this will act as a stimulant to the wider initiatives
proposed by Alan Dunlop for the intelligently planned regeneration of
our great city.

IT cannot be too cynical to note that distance from power makes
politicians more frank and more willing to commit themselves to
difficult decisions. It is always relatively easy for a third party to
make a virtue out of straightforward declarations which its competitors
find so difficult. Such thoughts will sustain supporters of the main
parties in the face of Mr Ashdown's speech to the Liberal-Democrat
conference in Glasgow yesterday. And it is true that a ringing quality
of robustness and unqualified commitment characterised his remarks. Yet
it really would be petty to dismiss them in the conventional way, for
the Lib Dems have stuck to their guns -- on devolution and hypothecated
taxation (an extra penny in the pound to be spent on education only),
and on Europe and the single currency, for example. By contrast, Mr
Blair's more hesitant approach can easily be made to look as if
''fudge'' and ''retreat'' could describe his attitudes to some matters.
The Liberals can be so sure because they are a minority, still distant
from parliamentary success, except at by-elections. Mr Blair, who seems
to have re-created a body of Labour support capable of carrying to, and
sustaining him in, government, undoubtedly looks more cautious. The
Government itself undoubtedly looks more tarnished since its certainties
have been tested by real experience but have weathered badly. Yet for
all these caveats it is hard to deny the positive and often radical
content of what Mr Ashdown spelled out yesterday. If it was not
precisely overlapping Labour's preferred positions, it was near enough
to make for the sort of co-operation before and after the next election
already offered the Lib Dems by Mr Blair. The two men presage the sort
of Lab-Lib understanding with which this century began and the Callaghan
administration saw temporarily revived (though Mr Ashdown will hope for
a better Lib-Dem reward than that offered).
Both the delivery and content of Mr Ashdown's speech will make it
harder for him to be displaced, even assuming the mutterers among the
parliamentary Liberals are not all convinced. The proximity to Labour
has been re-emphasised and no equidistance between the Liberals and the
big parties now exists, which may enhance tactical voting to the Tories
discomfiture in seats where Labour looks poorly placed, especially, but
not only, in southern England.

WHATEVER bafflement, argument, or intrigue may have been generated
among the planning committee on submission of Foster's design for
Glasgow's new ''armadillo'' conference hall, it is refreshing to welcome
a potential landmark building, confidently proposed by the architects
and approved by the authority in a deserving area.
The principles of good urban design in terms of what will fit are more
than just boring old in keeping every time. All aesthetic design is a
matter of balance between what is in harmony and what is in contrast,
whether we consider whole buildings in relation to their settings or
relationships between the different parts of one building, or consider
portable everyday equipment designed in isolation, introduced without
reference into an average interior.
Contrast is just as important as harmony and serves to create the
tension often necessary for more successful and memorable works or
architecture, a point often overlooked by authorities in their headlong
mission to control design.
It is right that there should be robust discussion, even argument
before approval of such bold schemes, but nothing justifies spite or
malice, not even where understanding may be overstretched.
No mean refusal. No mean approval. No mean city. All credit to Glasgow
and to all who are prepared to promote diversity and interest in a world
often too drab and over-cautious.

THE recent attempt by the Millennium Link group to seek a grant from
the Millennium Commission Lottery Fund to reopen the Forth and Clyde
Canal was not as successful as it deserved.
However, the commissioners have invited a revised application to be in
by November and, given the value and type of awards made recently, this
is one which should be a winner.
I urge The Herald and its readers to write in support of this worthy
cause which could bring economic recovery along its length, leisure and
recreation, and the ability to sail from city to city and which would be
a lasting and pleasing reminder of a transport system of the nineteenth
century which helped Scotland prosper.

<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL conglomerate BTR is expanding its interests in Europe and
in Brazil with two acquisitions together costing around #118m.
In Europe it is spending #56m on the battery business of German
company Vatra, while in Brazil it has paid #58.4m for a 94% stake in
automotive components manufacturer OSA and is launching a tender offer
for the remaining 6%.
BTR chairman Alan Jackson said it expected to use the acquisition of
the German battery business to help it expand such products generally.
''This is one of the areas that we are fostering as a global
business,'' he said, adding that it was an opportunity that had come
along that fitted in well with the group.
He described the Brazilian buy as a ''very deliberate strategic
move''. Mr Jackson said the growth in the automotive build in Brazil was
sensational. At present it is producing between 800,000 and 900,000
vehicles a year, estimated in the next year or two to grow to 1.5
million.
He added: ''That would put the country's car industry in about sixth
or seventh position worldwide and was an attractive prospect BTR did not
want to miss.''
The group would certainly seek similar sector acquisitions in Brazil,
he said. ''Now with inflation somewhat down and, I think, stable
Government, it's an environment we feel fairly bullish about.''

JUST as women are increasing their presence in the labour market, they
are taking to the roads in greater numbers making up almost two thirds
of learner drivers.
However, BSM, Britain's leading driving school with 15% market share,
saw weak demand for driving lessons in all sections of the community in
January and February and during the hot summer months.
A marketing campaign offering discounts on short courses in the spring
coupled with targeted marketing at key audiences, such as 17-25 year
olds, has led to a recovery in demand.
BSM's standard charges vary from #15.99 per hour in Glasgow to #18.75
in central London. Overall, turnover in the 26 weeks to June 30 was 3%
ahead at #11.9m. Pre-tax profits rose by 8.8% to #2.4m.
BSM currently operates 148 schools and 2600 Vauxhall Corsas. Its cars
are usually replaced after six months with around 18,000 miles on the
clock. Nine new outlets opened in the first half, including one in
Kilmarnock, taking the company's Scottish presence to 10.
Managing director Richard Glover said the group was keen to develop
its ''Logical Choice'' strategy, under which new business is generated
for its self-employed driving instructors.
Activities other than learner driver instruction currently account for
10% of BSM's turnover. Its fleet maintenance and management operation at
MCR in Coventry continues to improve its efficiency. In addition, it is
currently involved in corporate training programmes for the likes of
Vauxhall and Eagle Star.
Fleet car insurance bills could be vastly reduced by improving the
driving skills of company car users. BSM is also involved in a road
safety education programme for schools, ''Ignition'', aimed at catching
them young.
Going forward there is no sign of a sustained upward trend in consumer
confidence and with it spending. However, helped by the cooler weather,
BSM expects margins to recover in the second half from the 19.9% seen in
the first half, (20.4% last year).
There should also be an increased contribution from its new shops with
signs of rising demand for courses ahead of the introduction next June
of the compulsory theory test to accompany the existing driving
examination.
BSM shares reversed 14p to 171p compared with a flotation price two
years ago of 170p.

RIDING down the National Health Service with apocalyptic zeal, Sir
Duncan Nichol is demonstrably correct in one respect only. When he says
we need a debate on the provision of health care he is underlining what
has become an absolute requirement for the future of the nation. It will
not necessarily be the debate that Sir Duncan envisages, overcast by
dark warnings of the NHS's inability to provide free comprehensive
service in the future and the need for private provision. In stating
matters in this dogmatic way Sir Duncan joins with other recent
Jeremiahs like Mr Rodney Walker, the retiring chairman and now president
of the NHS Trust Federation, and Sir Leslie Turnberg, the president of
the Royal College of Physicians in forecasting diminishing NHS ability
to care and the need for national rationing of treatments. These are not
dishonourable men, but they have their own reasons for advancing these
opinions which are not necessarily altruistic. Sir Duncan, should anyone
forget, is the former chief executive of the NHS who hastened to join
Bupa, the private health group, as soon as possible after NHS
retirement.
What sort of debate should it be? The short and simple answer is that
the debate should be as well-informed as possible. That is not the case
at the moment as we are inundated with forecasts of rising numbers of
older people requiring the provision of health and welfare benefits, but
enjoying these benefits on the backs of a shrinking younger working
population. Quite apart from being nasty, insulting, and ageist,
statistics and predictions of this sort are misunderstood and very prone
to unscrupulous manipulation. They are based on demographics which is a
relatively precise method of mathematical evaluation. It can cope with
variables, but even the most earnest demographer will not argue that it
can cope with the entire gamut of variables posited by humankind. Health
statistics from the axe-grinders, for instance, try to convince us of an
NHS buckling under floods of geriatrics. They are drawn largely from
statistics based on predicted demand, whereas statistics on predicted
need (and, yes, need must be defined) present a different picture.
Advances in medical science, which should not be over-stressed,
nevertheless mean that people are treated more quickly and easily than
ever before. The Jeremiahs undoubtedly have a case, but it is not
necessarily the correct one and it is certainly not the only one. Other
studies argue quite differently. What is needed, as we began by saying,
is a debate which is properly informed and in which the agendas of all
contributors are made clear.
Inevitably, politics, and the wider question of state provision, are
intermingled with the health debate. The dominant agenda of the past two
decades has sought to convince us that the state could not afford to pay
for expanding services and that the only answer was to cut income tax,
thus allowing the economy to expand and enable individuals to spend
their greater prosperity on personal provision. In the light of modern
Britain nearly 20 years down this primrose path, such statements appear
ludicrous. Cutting income tax in this manner has been a fraud, for rises
in indirect taxes have made good the gap in revenue. Just as
hypocritical is the repetitive whine about the impossibility of finding
funds for public investment, while justifying the sale of public
investments to fund income tax cuts.
One issue rises inexorably from this morass. It is the question of
income tax and that somebody has to have the guts to raise the
possibility of higher taxes in the national interest. This is not such a
terrible proposition but it is clear that a measure of re-education is
necessary. If you argue, as does the present Government, that many state
activities are wrong, then income tax can be reduced. But income tax is
not evil; it is what provides the services we all, apart from the rich,
use regularly. Liberal Democrats propose raising income tax and telling
us exactly how much is used on health, education etc. This is sensible.
Unfortunately the Tories cannot think clearly on the issue and Labour is
traumatised by past Tory attacks on its spending plans. All of us, but
particularly the voters, must think in a grown-up way about the issue.
We can no longer afford to live in a low-tax fairyland. The gathering in
of taxes and the redistribution of their costs and benefits should be
the task of any modern democracy. To pretend that taxes can be slashed
is dishonest, as is the refusal to talk about the problem openly. For
the sake of health provision, for the sake of everything that the state
(us) does, but particularly for the sake of our children, we must
address the question of taxation directly and speedily.

A BRITISH cross-Channel ferry with almost 250 people on board ran
aground last night on the French coast.
The Stena Challenger became beached near Calais in rough seas and
gale-force winds at the end of its Channel crossing from Dover.
There were no casualties reported among the 172 passengers and 73
crew, but they faced a night marooned on board.
RAF and coastguard helicopters and French rescuers, including
lifeboats, were on standby to lift people off if required.
A French coastguard spokesman said the roll-on roll-off ferry had gone
aground at Bleriot Beach in a Force-6 gale.
A spokesman for Calais port authority said the Challenger seemed to
develop a problem with its engine as it neared the harbour.
