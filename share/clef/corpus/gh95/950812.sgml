MAROONED inside an island of newspapers, rooting contentedly through a
bin by her side, the legless Winnie muses the days away, her dreamy
incantation ''no worse, no better, no worse, no change, no gain,''
marking her fatalistic philosophy.
Samuel Beckett's heightened ritualism of habitual acts is interpreted
with cool self-possession by Angela Pleasence, who invests Winnie with
the detachment necessary to sustain her acceptance of her ludicrous
situation -- breezily discussing others' curiosity and horror of her
predicament as ''tosh''.
Her Winnie is a very bird-like creature, perched atop her pile of
rubbish, virtually trilling out her repetitive ''in the old style'' --
always followed by a mawkish gnashing of the gums. She seems at times
almost too insubstantial for the quite robust humour of the piece. It's
impeccably staged though, and Howard Goorney offers excellent timing and
comic support as Willie.

Paul McAuley, author of Fairyland.
* I'D TAKE Gene Woolf's Book Of The New Sun, the journey in four
volumes of a torturer on a planet millions of years in the future. Fate
backs him on to the throne of an ancient empire and the novels tell his
story. This is a great evocation of a distant era. The whole story is
about redemption and Woolf can handle the character brilliantly. The way
he evokes the humanity of him is one of the book's great pluses.
It filled me with a sense of wonder. It really was like looking
through a keyhole into another room. You realise that what you are
looking at is so much bigger than you thought. It is really a book of
layers with a great deal of information and illusion. What makes it
quite difficult to understand, also allows you to re-read it.

It's a book called The Hotel Room which has an entire chapter on the
colour grey, and what grey means and how grey reflects the world around
us. I read it out in writing workshops to encourage people -- it's very
hard to be this bad.
What is novel about it is that it doesn't become unconsciously funny,
most people can only stand two pages before their ears start bleeding
and they begin to chew off their legs.
I bought it second-hand in an Oxfam shop and it had no redeeming
pages. Even the cover was crap and the paper it was printed on was
rubbish. The spelling was accurate.
I kind of remember the author's name but I could get it wrong and
insult a perfectly decent Norwegian novelist. I finally gave it away to
Cancer Research tucked away under another pile of books. -- A L KENNEDY
I had to review Splash by Eve Pollard and two of her media mates for
Radio Scotland and it was a horror. The novel had been trapped in a time
warp and spun back 14 years. I honestly think the publishers were tucked
inside a cryogenic tank for the past few years.
If you didn't know Eve Pollard helped to write it then you would think
that the authors knew nothing about the media. You began to think do
they really live like this and if they do shouldn't we be worried? It's
a novel that crashed in Alien City. -- KAYE ADAMS
I wish I had never read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I'd seen
African Queen, Apocalypse Now, and the documentary on the making of
Apocalypse Now and I had all these preconceptions about it. I was sure
it was going to be much more terrifying, elemental, and psychological.
If I hadn't read it I would still be able to discuss how great it was.
Now I'm the person who when people discuss Heart of Darkness waits till
the end and goes . . . HMMMM! -- SIMON ARMITAGE, author of The Dead Sea
Poems
RICHARD ALLEN ruined my life. He made me put on an English accent and
go around the town looking for ethnic minorities to beat up. Despite the
fact that I knew well our town didn't have any ethnic minorities, except
a Nigerian surgeon who worked in the county hospital, and you couldn't
be seen beating him up.
He even managed, in my later university period, to get me saying:
''There is a certain crucial urban poetry in Skinhead, don't you
think?''
Dear reader, I might die of shame as I recollect, and probably will,
only that my mother had the good sense to burn the lot at the bottom of
my garden -- Skinhead, Suedehead, Biker Girls -- all up in smoke.
Of course, it's all history now and I am much older and wiser, not to
mention sophisticated. But each night as my head touches the pillow I
hear it. Joe Hawkins, alias Skinhead, is at it again, dancing away in
his Docs, chuckling maniacally, as he points his white bony fingers:
''You used to read me and you thought I was good.'' I wish I'd never
read this. -- PATRICK McCABE, author of  The Butcher Boy and The Dead
School.

SHAUN Harrold, second trumpet player with the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra, gave bank clerk Gillian Atlee a sneak preview of this month's
Bank of Scotland fireworks concert.
Around 250,000 to 300,000 people are expected to watch the fireworks
later this month when Edinburgh city centre will be closed off as crowds
pack the streets surrounding Princes Street Gardens.
The concert is being sponsored for the first time by the Bank of
Scotland but it is staying tight-lipped about the content.
Harrold, who has been taking part in firework concerts since 1986,
told Business Diary: ''There will be up to 50 musicians playing and the
fireworks will go off behind us at the castle.''
When asked how he could concentrate with all the noise, he did not
want to blow his own trumpet but said he was able to just block it out.
Swept away by southern success
THE Government appears to be carried away with its ''success'' in
sweeping away petty restrictions faced by businesses and the public.
A recent news release from the Cabinet Office no less has Roger
Freeman, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, posing the kind of
questions politicians like -- ones that they ask themselves and then
give the answers to.
''Do you realise how many other steps the Government has taken to cut
red tape and abolish petty restrictions?'' he asks. ''The answer is 500
by the end of this year with another 500 to come.''
Giving examples of the Government's runaway success in this direction
he continues: ''This Sunday afternoon the whole family will be able to
enjoy the sunshine and a drink in their local beer garden, thanks to
all-day Sunday licensing.''
Shops, he goes on to point out, can also open on a Sunday and
marriages may now take place in new locations such as stately homes or
hotels.
Funny, but I'm sure that in Scotland we have been able to do all these
things for quite a few years.
We can, says the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, look forward to
going to a dance hall or disco on a Sunday. I was doing that in Glasgow
30 years ago.
Perhaps he should confine the distribution of his press releases to
South of the Border in future or the Scottish Office should remind him
that at least one part of the UK has its own legal system separate from
that of England and Wales.
Making a meal of confusion
IAN G Cumming, managing director of Corney and Barrow Whighams, the
wine company whose cellar in Ayr is the oldest in Scotland dating back
to 1766, agreed it had to happen.
His salary has finally been credited to his PR consultant's bank
account, which is perhaps understandable as his PR goes under the name
of Ian Grant Cumming. However, the latter claimed he was unaware of the
sudden boost to his income as his bank statement hadn't yet arrived.
Ian G Cumming of Whighams also tells another amusing tale of a
television interview. He was enjoying a meal in Fouters restaurant which
is next door to his wine business when he was approached by a BBC
television crew.
They were in the restaurant mainly to interview owner Laurie Black in
his role as chairman of the Taste of Burns Country group. Mr Cumming,
who today celebrates 27 years in the wine business, assumed they would
want to ask him about the smuggling of claret along the Ayrshire coast
and Rabbie's role as an excise man.
Therefore, he was rather taken aback when they asked for his views on
the haggis which was on the menu, a subject he did not have such strong
opinions about.
Glorious response to competition
THE entries came pouring in when we asked readers to explain the
background to the hymn ''Thine Be The Glory'' -- and everyone gave the
correct answer.
In the Church of Scotland hymnary it is sung to the music of ''See The
Conquering Hero Comes'', which was the popular tune ''Judas Maccabaeus''
written by a grateful George Frederick Handel to honour the Duke of
Cumberland on his return to London after cuffing the rebellious Scots at
Culloden!
You really are a clever lot, or perhaps I am just dumb for I certainly
did not know the answer until Alwyn James of Royal Bank of Scotland
enlightened me. He will be sending out copies of the bank's booklet
''The Diary of John Campbell'' in the next few days.
Among the replies we received was one from Paula Fleetwood from
Cathcart, Glasgow, who wrote: ''We sing the hymn in church fairly
frequently and it always worries me because the church in question is an
Episcopal one and the Episcopalians in 1745/6 were Jacobites almost to a
man.''
Perhaps the hymn will not be sung so lustily in future Mrs Fleetwood,
now Business Diary readers have shared their knowledge with the great
Scottish public.
We also got a cheeky bit of PR from Fearchar I MacIllfhinnein, who
wrote: ''Research! What Research? My wife knows these things off the top
of her head. She produced the newly-published songbook 'Do Ghinealach
Eile' under the auspices of Feis Tir A Mhurain, South Uist's all-Gaelic
arts festival.''
''Do Ghinealach Eile'' costs #5.95 and includes the complete music and
text of 40 short songs collected from the oral tradition in South Uist.

IT'S Scotland's first national book day today. Away from all the
official programme events -- the roadshows, library amnesties and
competitions -- there's a fringe party, complete with Russian-style
barbeque, planned at the Clydeside premises of the Albany Book Company.
The party marks the launch on the road of ABC's latest investment, an
#80,000 custom-built mobile showroom for its products. From Monday the
distinctive purple pantechnicon, with its seven-tonne load of children's
books, will criss-cross Scotland -- first stop Montrose -- driven by
John Macfarlane, a professional librarian who, perhaps uniquely, boasts
an HGV licence as well.
It will take a selection of Albany's stock to the school and library
customers who find it difficult to come to the company's Scotstoun base
to place their orders. The mobile showroom, linked by computer to
central stock control, is another initiative in a marketplace bedevilled
by uncertainty over the future of the Net Book Agreement, the spending
priorities of the new single-tier councils, and the future shape of an
industry awash with new titles and new players, trying to reinvent how
books are sold.
When I last wrote about Albany and its managing director Andrew Haigh
more than two years ago, the company had just completed the bold step of
buying established Edinburgh publishing house Canongate. But boldness
quickly turned to blood as Canongate's losses mounted and, by last
summer, threatened to drag Albany down as well.
Eventually, Haigh had to bite the bullet. Last September Canongate was
put into receivership. Three weeks later, it was bought by a former
director and a member of staff and started yet another chapter in its
chequered history. Most of the attendant publicity has gone to
Canongate, emphasising the imprint's heroic struggle to survive. Haigh
has said little.
This week he told me Albany had been forced to write off nearly
#600,000 as a result of the affair, with another #30,000 still to be
written off in this year's accounts. The publishing house's debts had
doubled in the 18 months Albany owned it. More than #200,000 of the
losses had, he explains, stemmed directly from titles which failed.
''I was very naive, I admit it now,'' he says. ''The episode has left
me bitter, but wiser.'' Management controls were too lax he now belives.
One title, ''Memories of Maryhill'', sold out in a month but still lost
money, because someone decided to commission a substitute jacket design
at the last minute. That added #800 to costs and turned a successful
launch into another loss maker.
The debacle has forced Haigh and Albany to refocus on their core
business, selling nearly #10m worth of books a year to schools and
libraries. Given the damage Canongate inflicted on its balance sheet,
that mobile showroom demonstrates just how determined the directors are
to maximise their share of the market they know best.
Les McGregor, a colleague of Haigh's when they both worked for
distributor Bookwise, who joined Albany 15 months ago as deputy MD, says
simply: ''It's the old story of the talents. You can't make progress by
burying them in the ground.''
McGregor argues that the mobile showroom, with the investment spread
over seven years, will find it difficult to lose money. It is already
booked solid until Christmas, including a three-week tour of Ayrshire
schools. ''Even if it doesn't generate a lot of extra revenue, it will
be promoting the Albany name,'' he adds.
And, in an increasingly competitive market, with more buyers doing
business direct with the publishers and more English-based suppliers
eyeing the Scottish market, that matters.
A separate Albany initiative, the Big Book Box, is an attempt to grab
a share of the direct sales to children in schools market for the first
time.
Such book fairs in schools have become a common way of raising
additional funds, on a commission basis on each sale, for hard-pressed
school budgets. The market, up until now, has been dominated by two
English suppliers. Albany has developed an interlinking set of three
containers, shaped like giant books, which open up to reveal around a
thousand titles.
There are six sets of three containers which can be left in individual
schools for a week at a time, while pupils make their purchases. ''We
can supply the best of Scottish children's books which you can't get at
rival fairs,'' explains Haigh.
The economics of all these ventures, like the discounts Albany can
offer library and schoolbook buyers, are predicated on the kind of
stable retail pricing the Net Book Agreement has ensured. But this week
the Publishers' Association failed in its bid to prevent the NBA being
referred to the Restrictive Practices Court. And the well publicised
moves by Hodder Headline and supermarket chain ASDA to challenge that
orthodoxy are already undermining the system.
''Frankly ASDA is a pain in the neck,'' he says. ''I've stopped going
to my local ASDA in protest. I hope the NBA continues because it's very
much in the interest of the book business.''
Like other defenders, he maintains it protects the vast choice of new
titles published every year (87,000 added to the 700,000 titles in print
last year alone) and the ability of minority interest authors to see
their work in print.
''If the agreement goes I think many booksellers and smaller
publishers will go to the wall,'' he predicts. ''And I don't think the
price of books will fall. In fact, I think prices will rise. I'm dead
against it.''
As if that uncertainty weren't enough, Albany also has to wrestle with
the likely spending priorities of the new councils. ''April 1996 worries
me,'' he confesses. We haven't suffered as much as the English library
suppliers up to now. But no-one expects the same budgets next year.
There will be cuts and we'll all lose out.''
That sounds like real gloom coming on top of the financial losses the
Canongate entanglement involved. But, despite the challenges, Haigh and
Albany seem in remarkably good heart as the new bookmobile takes to the
road. Monday in Montrose opens a new chapter.

THIS month marks the first anniversary of the market launch of a
trailblazing Scottish company which specialises in the development and
production of a sophisticated telephone call management system. And
since its beginnings, Oriole Systems, though a newcomer among the giants
of the telephone switch industry, has made significant inroads into the
UK market for this type of system -- a market currently worth about #79m
a year and expected to continue to grow annually by about 40%.
It is the proliferation of telephones and their essential contribution
to every area of life which has, ironically, created this vast potential
market: companies whose callers fail to connect. Termed telephone tag,
it includes the well-known phenomena of lost messages, unanswered
phones, calls diverted wrongly or unreturned. Research shows that 75% of
all business phone calls do not reach their target first time, that 67%
of business calls are less important than the business they interrupt,
and that when written messages are taken, 90% contain inaccurate or
insufficient information.
In the US the response to this inefficiency was swift: by the late
eighties technology was being developed so that around 10% of companies
there now have telephone call management systems. By interacting with
the caller these can automatically route incoming calls, take messages
and alert the target.
Two years ago the four directors of Oriole Systems, all of whom had
been involved in different aspects of the computer and voice technology
industry, started talking about launching a Scottish call processing
product. They felt they could develop something cheaper, more versatile,
and more attractive than the dominant American product.
There are, says Bob Wallace, Oriole's finance director, three main
elements to its package: the PC which is a dedicated 486 processor, the
voice board which digitises the voice messages received over the phone
and stores them on the computer, and the software written by the Oriole
team. The resulting system provides a flexible and quick response to
every caller.
It means that the office can be ''staffed'' 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, and the initial welcome message can be personalised daily.
Callers' messages can be forwarded instantly to another number, and
messages can be edited and re-recorded by the caller. The owner of the
mailbox can distribute his or her messages and add comments, and the
whole system can be re-programmed by phone.
All this is possible because the telephone key pad can be used by the
caller or the owner of the mailbox to interact with the computer
terminal. Also a great variety of new programmes for specific purposes
can easily be written into the software.
Having developed its product, Paisley-based Oriole's next hurdle was
obtaining finance. Wallace and his three fellow directors are the major
shareholders of the company. In addition to loans from Strathclyde
Business Development Agency and Bank of Scotland, Renfrewshire
Enterprise was so impressed by the company's potential that through its
newly-established Business Growth Fund it took a substantial block of
Preference shares.
Since then Oriole has gradually established a firm foothold in the
telephony management market. It has already completed 15 installations,
and Wallace is confident this year's turnover of #200,000 will be easily
doubled by the end of 1996.
Meanwhile, the company is advancing on several other related fronts.
It has become UK distributor for one of the world's leading suppliers of
telephone and voice processing systems, Applied Voice Technology. And
because the prospects afforded by continuously developing technology --
the integration of telephony, IT, E-mail and faxes -- are mushrooming
rapidly, Oriole is knocking on doors which are beginning to open by
themselves. Business customers are, says Wallace, fast becoming more
aware of the great advantages that automated telephone call management
can bring.

LAURA Davies recovered from a shaky start ysterday to return a
second-round 69 to lead the field in the Woodpecker Welsh Open at St
Pierre.
With a nine-under-par halfway aggregate of 137, Davies leads by one
stroke from Trish Johnson and Amaia Arruti, from Spain, who had set the
early target.
Davies was upset at the slow pace of play, with rounds taking almost
five hours, as the temperatures soared. ''That is the slowest round I
have played.'' said Davies. ''Everybody wants to play slowly these days,
that's the way it goes.''
Three times over the opening six holes Davies found sand. She was four
over for the day at that stage and had dropped back to seven strokes
behind Arruti who had handed in a 70 to stand at eight under.
However, Davies never can be written off and the world No.1 came back
in style with a run of seven birdies and an eagle in nine holes from the
eighth, where she holed from 12ft for a birdie 3.
Davies then struck a No.6-iron to eight feet for an eagle at the ninth
to be out in 37 then birdied the next three holes. The spell was broken
when she found sand at the thirteenth but she hit back immediately.
A No.7 iron just missed the green at the next but Davies chipped to
the side of the hole for her 4. She reduced the 334 yards to a No.3 wood
and chip to six inches for a 3 then birdied the sixteenth to complete a
remarkable recovery.
Arruti, who plays right handed but switches to left handed on the
greens, plays much of her winter golf with Jose Maria Olazabal in the
north of Spain. After a year in America she feels that her immediate
future is in Europe. ''I feel I need more experience before going back
to America.'' she reasons.
Johnson had two sixes in her round of 70 but compensated for these
lapses with six birdies, while Dale Reid, who tried out a broom-handled
putter on the first day, switched to a more conventional model to
complete a round of 70 to lead the Scottish challenge at level par on
146.

Tour so far this year, had to be content with a 68 yesterday but still
retained a four-shot lead after two rounds of the Hohe Brucke Austrian
Open in Litschau.
The 24-year-old German's two-round aggregate of 129, 15 under par,
left him four shots ahead of Dutchman Rolf Muntz (65 for 133), with
Irishmen Paul McGinley and Brendan McGovern one shot further back.
Ronan Rafferty, who won this event two years ago, was another Irishman
well in contention, moving into joint-fifth place with a 66 for 135.
European Ryder Cup player Steven Richardson, still searching for some
good form, was on 136 but did not help his cause by losing a ball at the
first hole, his tenth, when it sailed into trees.
Cejka, who has a love of fast cars and owns a Ferrari, Lancia, and a
Porsche, said he did not play defensively yesterday to protect his lead.
''I didn't want to screw it up with a 76 but I played aggressively,'' he
said. ''Today only four putts dropped while I had 11 single putts in the
first round. That was the difference.''
On his current form he will be hard to catch, although McGinley and
Rafferty, anxious to clinch a place in the Irish Dunhill Cup team which
will be known after the Czech Open next week, do not lack incentive.
McGinley did particularly well yesterday, for after 13 holes he was
lying four shots behind Rafferty. But he then had four successive
birdies while his rival dropped a shot to finish one ahead in what has
become known as the ''Irish Stakes.''
Muntz had eight birdies and only one bogey in his 65 but the surprise
of the day was that McGovern, after his first round of 65, kept his cool
for a 69.
Craig Ronald, with a second-round 70, is seven shots off the pace on
136, while Brian Marchbank, who carded a 70, one more than his opening
score, is on the 139 mark.
Steve McAlister's second round of 68 was four shot better than his
first placing the Scot on the 140 mark, while Mike Miller is on stroke
further behind with Adam Hunter, on 142, rounding off the Scottish
contingent. Qualifiers (GB and Ireland unless stated * denotes amateur):

FRANK Bruno yesterday urged the British Boxing Board of Control to be
''lenient'' on World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Oliver McCall.
But if they are not, Bruno is prepared to pay McCall's fine to make
certain the American does not get the first flight home to Chicago, as
he threatened yesterday.
McCall, who last week fired some chilling ''vengeance'' threats in
Bruno's direction, warned: ''If they fine me a pin, I'm on the plane.''
The champion has been called before the BBBC's disciplinary men on
Monday to explain his outburst -- and there has even been talk of a
#20,000 penalty.
''I've had enough of all this. I've waited a long time for this
fight,'' said Bruno. ''I've worked hard and I'm not prepared to let some
fine get in the way of my becoming world champion.
''I know McCall, and I know if he is provoked enough, he will turn his
back on this fight. He knows I'm in shape and he's worried. All I'm
interested in is getting in the ring and take the WBC belt off Oliver.''
''I appeal to the powers that be to be lenient, but if there is a
fine, I am prepared to pay it if it means that this fight goes ahead.''

IRELAND defeated Britain by just one quarter fault yesterday as they
won their own Nations Cup contest at the Dublin Horse Show.
The British quartet, aiming to repeat last year's Aga Khan Trophy win,
pulled back strongly in the second round with three of their riders
going clear.
But, with Michael Whitaker picking up a quarter time fault on Midnight
Madness, it was not enough to prevent Ireland repeating their narrow win
over Britain at the Aachen show six weeks ago.
Then the Irish gained revenge for a jump-off defeat at the German
course last year.
Ireland established a halfway lead with clears from Peter Charles, on
La Ina, and veteran Eddie Macken, on Miss FAN.
Britain -- in third place behind France at this stage -- came back
with Nick Skelton faultless on Showtime and Michael Whitaker following a
disappointing opening round on Midnight Madness with another clear,
spoiled by his time penalty.
John Whitaker, last of the British team, posted another zero score
with Grannusch. But Ireland had already made sure of shading them with
Trevor Coyle's clear on Cruising.

ANTONIO Garrido revelled in the warm conditions as he returned a
five-under 65 in the first round of the Forte PGA Seniors championship
at Sunningdale.
The Spaniard opened up a two-shot lead over a chasing pack of four
players -- defending champion John Morgan, Malcolm Gregson, John
Donoghue, and Tommy Horton.
Two of golf's greats, five-times Open champion Peter Thomson and
Ireland's Christy O'Connor, proved they have not lost their touch when
they shot 68 and 69 respectively.
Horton, who suffered from conjunctivitis, carved his drive into trees
at the last to finish with a bogey.
* RUSSELL Weir scooped the individual and team prizes in the Caldwell
Pro-Am yesterday with a five-under-par round of 66, edging him a stroke
clear of local professional Paul Alexander. Scores:
66 -- R Weir (Cowal). 67 -- P Alexander (Caldwell). 68 -- A Tait
(Cawder), G Harvey (Grangemouth). 69 -- A McCloskey (Airdrie), S Kerr
(Renfrew), B Deas (Praytis Farm Park), B Lockie (Kilmarnock Barassie), K

THE tortured, troubled spirit that is Linford Christie has emerged
following the return of the dethroned world champion to Sweden after
assessment of the injury which contributed to the loss of his 100 metres
crown last Sunday.
In distinctly valedictory tones, he revealed the extent of his
injuries, and the depths of inner grief and pressure following the death
of his mother.
Whatever the scepticism about his earlier professed intention to
retire this year, that now seems increasingly more probable. In addition
to a hamstring tear, he confirms he has cartilage trouble. But he
refuses to undergo surgery.
''There is a problem with the knee,'' he said. ''It's going to be a
slow rehabilitation, I'm afraid.
''The cartilage won't tear or anything. It gives me a lot of pain. At
the end of the day, I came into the championships with the cartilage,
and I'm going to go out with it. I am not going to do anything about it.
''It seems that Zurich (next Wednesday) is out. I don't really want to
run again unless I am fit. The reason that I broke down in the first
place is that I was trying to get back too soon. I tried to run because
the World championships are so important. I wanted to be here. I will
take my time now.
''At the end of the day I race against people -- that's me. I have
been racing Donovan Bailey all year. I think it is a good thing that
Donovan Bailey is the world champion. Maybe that now will make people
realise that back home Linford is no longer the world champion.''.
He believes it will take the focus off him, but only when he is absent
from next year's Atlanta Olympics would the extent of his loss to the
sport be realised.
Emotionally, he linked this to the death of his mother on the eve of
the European Cup final earlier this summer.
''They can't say Linford is world champion -- they've got to speak to
someone else. There will now be less lies about me. They need to
appreciate what they've got.
''Next year, when the Olympics come around, what have they got to talk
about? Maybe they've not always appreciated what they've got.
''I've had to put up with a lot of crap in the weeks leading up to the
World championships. All the other athletes from other countries have
been allowed to get on with what they were doing, and concentrate on the
championships. Our people at home were not giving me that opportunity.''
He was particularly offended by intrusive media attention when his
mother died. ''I'd to put up with people ringing the house and asking if
they could see the body . . . people giving my dad a hard time. We've
been through a lot. You never know what you've got till it's gone.
''Unfortunately, that is going to be the case. Maybe people are now
realising it.''

THERE were torrents of tears from Gwen Torrence yesterday as she made
a dignified defence against allegations of cheating in the world 200m
final, writes Doug Gillon.
Disqualified after finishing ahead of Merlene Ottey, she was
devastated when the Jamaican claimed her rival's lane infraction was
deliberate.
Ottey, Jamaican ambassador without portfolio, was also lacking in
diplomacy by suggesting that when Torrence intruded into the lane inside
her, it had been ''cheating'' to steal an advantage.
''I was very disappointed that Merlene should make such a comment, not
so much as an athlete, but as a mother,'' said Torrence yesterday.
''I can accept her hurting me, but when it goes out of my control, to
my husband and my little boy, I have a big problem.''
Tears flowed as she recalled her six-year-old son. ''He can read the
papers, and I am going to have to explain things to him . . . I am
afraid to call my little boy -- someone told him his mother cheated.
''I watched the race, and I did step on the line for three strides,
and I accept that. But when you are going at full speed, it's the last
thing you think about. I didn't impede anybody, and I don't think I
gained any advantage, I was so far ahead . . . I ran a great race, and
it serves no purpose to risk being disqualified.
''I was trying to be the first US woman to do the sprint double at
these championships, and in my heart I did it, though on paper I did
not.''
There is little doubt that her transgression was accidental, and Ottey
finally acknowledged as much later, saying: ''If it was an accident, I
apologise.''
However, running on the line did help Torrence emerge into the
straight with a psychological as well as actual advantage.
The rivals are likely to meet again on a showdown anchor leg in the 4
x 100m final tomorrow. ''I am not going in there throwing punches, or
fighting any war,'' added Torrence. ''I can't go in with any anger.''

SCOTLAND will not be able to use the powerful talents of Duncan
Ferguson in the crucial European Championship match with Greece at
Hampden next Wednesday. The former Rangers man, now with Everton, has
had to be withdrawn from the squad because of injury. It means that
manager Craig Brown's plan to use Ferguson alongside another ex-Rangers
man, Chelsea's John Spencer, to test the Greece resilience has had to be
scuppered.
Ferguson suffered a groin injury in the 2-0 win over PSV Eindhoven,
during which he reportedly endured a lot of 'robust' treatment, and his
manager, Joe Royle, phoned the SFA yesterday to inform them of the
situation.
''It is a disappointment for us, especially as we have only had Duncan
for one match to date, against Greece last December,'' said Brown.
''We will just have to get on without him. I won't be calling in any
other player because we had five strikers in the squad.''
The choice now will be between Spencer, Duncan Shearer of Aberdeen,
John Robertson of Hearts, and Darren Jackson of Hibs.
However, Shearer would seem the only one of the others who has the
same aerial threat and physique that would have been offered by
Ferguson, who has had his problems with injury since he left Ibrox for
#4.3m in December.
He has gone through a double hernia operation but Royle insisted
yesterday that the latest injury has no connection with his previous
problems.
Even so, with the absence of others who have been beset with injury
concerns, like Ally McCoist of Rangers, John McGinlay of Bolton, and the
Aberdeen pair, Scott Booth and Eoin Jess, Brown would have been happier
with the availability of someone of Ferguson's ability.
Meanwhile, one man who is unlikely to return to Scotland action,
Richard Gough, talked confidently about Rangers' chances of complying
with the bookmakers' assessment, that they will win their eighth
successive premier division title.
As the league sponsors, Bell's, paraded three of the four captains of
the favourites for each division (Ayr's skipper was unable to make it)
Gough, naturally, found himself in a little more demand than the skipper
of the third division fancies, Cammy Robertson of Ross County, or even
Dundee United's young leader, Christian Dailly.
Gough, not a betting man, still managed to use one of the racing
fraternity's favourite phrases when he commented on the 6-1 on Hills
quote his team, for the title. ''I will only say that the team that
finishes ahead of us will win.''
He has already said that he believes Rangers have the strongest squad
at Ibrox for some time. ''I think there are 20 internationalists in the
pool and that will mean a lot of competition for places. I think Celtic
will be a much stronger team this year. Tommy Burns, after winning the
cup, will have them better organised. Our manager will have a lot of
options and if everybody stays fit I would be very confident.''
Gough acknowledges that the form of the team last year was not
exciting. ''Our standards dropped but we have got four new players this
term and that is a lot of new men. They have given the place a real buzz
and, if anybody drops below standard, they know they will not be in the
side.''
The club captain has just as much confidence that Rangers will get
through the preliminary round of the Champions Cup, despite the narrow
lead they will take to Cyprus. ''If you look at the European Cup results
you will see there were not many goals. We would have been happier with
two goals but I am confident Rangers can win anywhere.''
Dundee United start 11-8 on for the first division title while Ayr
United, at 7-2, are the favourites for the second, and Ross County lead
the way, as far as the bookies are concerned, in the third. New club
Livingston, with the irrepressible Jim Leishman in charge, appeal a good
deal for that title at 7-2.

A LEGAL bid by the World Rugby Corporation to secure the services of
the world champion Springbok squad has failed, at least temporarily.
Last weekend WRC obtained a court order in Cape Town which prevented
the South African Rugby Football Union from talking to its players after
they had signed letters of intent to turn out for a planned WRC global
tournament.
Yesterday in Cape Town, as WRC director Ross Turnbull sought to have
the temporary order extended, Justice Denis van Reenen decided that the
case did not merit urgent attention and the restraining order will be
allowed to lapse pending further hearings at a later date.
The WRC bid to sign up hundreds of the world's top players for a
30-team professional tournament is said to be backed by Australian media
tycoon Kerry Packer. However, concrete evidence that Packer is
bankrolling the project has not been produced and the Scottish Rugby
Union's International Rugby Football Board representative, Freddie
McLeod, has indicated that he has strong doubts as to whether Packer is
materially involved.
In South Africa yesterday, SARFU president Lois Luyt, who was
instrumental in negotiating the Southern Hemisphere Unions'
multi-million pound broadcasting deal with Packer's rival, Rupert
Murdoch, said that WRC had no money and the contracts it was offering to
players were worthless.
The fact that the Southern Hemisphere Unions are now dripping with
cash as a result of the Murdoch deal -- New Zealand have offered All
Black stars more than #100,000 for a season's work -- and the rival WRC
plans means that the IB meeting on professionalism later this month,
when pay-for-play is likely to be endorsed, has taken on a new focus.
Yesterday in Cape Town, WRC were ordered to pay the costs of the
hearings. The outcome represented a small but significant victory for
SARFU, which has sought to keep its World Cup stars under contract as
the still technically amateur sport swings toward professionalism.
However, van Reenen took no stand on the crux of the dispute --
whether South African players who have signed up with the WRC must
honour their contracts or can accept different deals from the SARFU.
The South African and other unions have been awaiting the outcome of
the meeting before meeting player demands for increased remuneration for
their services.
Francois Pienaar, who captained the South African team to victory in
the World Cup last June, has admitted recruiting his team-mates for the
WRC. He reportedly stood to gain #187,000 from WRC but has said that he
has not accepted a penny.
Pienaar has turned his back on the WRC and stated that he signed up
several players but insisted to WRC representatives that they have an
indefinite option to withdraw. The players, including Pienaar, have
since accepted offers to stay with the SARFU.
Turnbull maintains that 28 Springboks and more than 100 other South
African players must abide by contracts to play for the group and can
only opt out if not paid by late November.
Earlier this week, as the SRU announced that it is to embrace
professionalism as its submission to the IB meeting, McLeod was scathing
in his condemnation of WRC.
He declared: ''I have reason to believe that the likelihood of the WRC
scheme going ahead is unlikely. Would you sign a contract which had so
many ifs, buts, and maybes? My advice to any player tempted to sign
would be not to do so until you were sure that it could be fulfilled.''

ONLY Scotland's legendary Olympian, Eric Liddell, had ever approached
what Michael Johnson surpassed yesterday at the World Athletics
Championships.
When Johnson, uniquely, added 200 metres gold to his 400m title, he
eclipsed Liddell, the 1924 Olympic one-lap champion, and the only other
athlete previously to have won a medal in both these events at a major
championship occasion.
In addition to his 400m success which ignited the script for Chariots
of Fire, Liddell took bronze over 200m in Paris 71 years ago.
Sally Gunnell's world 400m hurdles record was eclipsed by American Kim
Batten and runner-up Tonja Buford, while pole-vaulter Sergey Bubka took
his fifth successive gold, the only person to have won every time since
the inaugural championships 12 years ago in Helsinki.
Lars Reidel (discus) and Moses Kiptanui (steeplechase) won their third
consecutive titles with championship records. Germany's Reidel reached
68.76 metres, while the Kenyan, only 23, ran the third-fastest time
ever, 8min 04.16sec. Only he himself has run faster.
But the night belonged to the 27-year-old Texan, Johnson. His winning
time of 19.79sec was just .07 outside the 16-year-old world record, set
at altitude in Mexico City. Johnson's was the fifth-fastest time ever.
Britain's former European champion, John Regis, was a remote seventh
in 20.67 -- a result of devastating financial consequences: it will
reduce his appearance fees in the UK from #12,000 per race to #1000.
Johnson, like Liddell, showed humility in paying tribute to God for
bestowing the talent which made this possible. He also acknowledged the
organisers' role -- they amended the programme to allow him to display
it.
''If I am given the opportunity next year, I hope I can do just as
well, or better at the Olympics,'' he added. ''The current schedule
doesn't permit it, but I feel confident something will be done now. This
is proof that I am serious.''
In the 400m, Johnson had run the second-fastest time ever, and he said
in frustration after his 200m near-miss: ''I think if I can get the
first few strides right I can do 19.60 or better, and I can go below
43.00 in the 400. I'm very confident that one, if not both records, will
fall before the end of the season.''
Batten and 400m hurdles runner-up Buford were just .01 apart, in
52.61and 52.62, against 52.74, the former world mark of the injured,
absent Gunnell.
Ukrainian Bubka cleared 5.92m to win the pole vault ahead of Scottish
indoor all-comers' record-holder Maksim Tarasov (5.86).
Bubka went for his thirty-sixth world record, at 6.15m, but failed.
The cynics remarked that there was no bonus. But he promised: ''I
believe it is possible for me to go over 6.20. In future I will improve
the record by more than one centimetre at a time.
''I'm only in one event, not like Michael Johnson or Carl Lewis. I'm
just a pole vaulter -- it's a small history.''
Steve Backley, with his first throw (83.20m) and Mick Hill (83.54m),
were among the 12 who reached tomorrow's final of the men's javelin.
World record-holder Jan Zelezny led the qualifiers with 90.12m, the
world's third-best throw of the year.
Tony Jarrett found the mantle of the absent out-going 110m hurdles
champion, Colin Jackson, to be a good fit. The Englishman, quickest
qualifier for the semi-finals (13.23), crossed the line .01 ahead of the
fast-finishing European silver medallist, Florian Schwarthoff.
Commonwealth 5000m champion Rob Denmark went out, as did Adrian
Passey, leaving John Nuttall (13-25.18) the sole survivor for today's
final. Gary Lough (3-37.38) is in the 1500m final.
After Kelly Holmes had reached tomorrow's 800m final, her medal hopes
were hugely enhanced by the disqualification of the defending champion
and favourite, Maria Mutola. Like Gwen Torrence a day earlier, she ran
out of her lane.

US PGA Championship
COLIN Montgomerie yesterday moved into a position increasingly
familiar to him. He took over from Sandy Lyle as the leading European to
challenge for a major title, this time the US PGA Championship, with a
score of 67 in the second round for a total of 135, seven under par, and
only four strokes behind the clubhouse leader, Ernie Els.
In hot sunshine Montgomerie, whose lack of putting confidence has been
largely responsible for his inability to win for 12 months, made putts
of 15, 12, and 15 feet for successive birdies from the fifth to be out
in 32, three under.
Another birdie at the long eleventh completed his acquisitions and
Montgomerie finished the round without having dropped a stroke.
However, Lyle scored as though he had on Thursday flown too close to
the heat of rediscovered form.
With three bogeys, he took six strokes more than Montgomerie had to
reach the turn and, although Lyle made two birdies on the inward half,
the twelfth cost him a stroke and his score of 73 consigned him to the
obscurity of two under par.
Els, the 25-year-old prodigy from South Africa, who already had one
major title to his name, the US Open, made a significant move towards
adding a second. His score of 65 gave him a total of 131, 11 under par,
equalling the 36-hole championship record established by Hal Sutton.
That was achieved in 1983 when the event was first held at the Riviera
Country Club and, omen or not, Sutton went on to win. When Els finished
he led by three strokes from former US amateur champion Justin Leonard,
round in 66, Australia's Steve Elkington, who had 67 for 135, and Brian
Claar, a later arrival.
Among the European contingent the clubhouse lead was held jointly by
Sam Torrance, Jose-Maria Olazabal, and Miguel Jiminez on 138, four
under. Torrance and Jiminez repeated their opening 69s but Olazabal,
limp and all, recovered bravely from a potentially damaging 72 by
improving on that score by six strokes.
But if they and Costantino Rocca, the Open runner-up, could look
forward to a rewarding weekend's work Nick Faldo, on the par of 142, and
Ian Woosnam, one stroke higher, were on the borderline of making the
cut. Whatever total that turned out to be would be far beyond the reach
of Severiano Ballesteros, on 151 after struggling home in 40, four over.
Torrance finished with a flourish, hitting No.7-iron shots to six and
18ft respectively at the short sixteenth and the last for birdies. He
had temporary blips in the middle of the round, missing the eighth and
ninth greens with quite short approaches but later, his upset stomach
now also settled, Torrance said: ''If I can beat 70 in all four rounds
that won't be too bad.''
Olazabal, on the cusp of an automatic Ryder Cup team place as tenth
and last man on the points list, made light of the injured right foot
which causes him to hirple constantly. Beginning with an eagle 3, he was
out in 30 and four under for the round after 16 holes when a birdie at
the seventeenth and 12ft putt to save par at the last staunched the
wounds of bogeys at the two previous holes.
Woosnam took three strokes more than Faldo at the first, where his
bogey 6 included three putts from four feet, the first for a birdie
missing the hole and the second for par from two feet lipping out. After
that there was little evidence that Woosnam could turn around a dismal
year which has included only two top 10 finishes. Second-round

WORLD championship leader Michael Schumacher may have had a
disappointing day yesterday in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix
but he is poised to become the richest driver in Formula One history
with a #16m wedding present from Ferrari.
The world champion is expected finally to sign for the Italian team on
Monday, with Frenchman Jean Alesi moving in the opposite direction by
joining Benetton.
But Schumacher, who married his girlfriend Corinna last week, has
quashed a claim from Fiat tycoon Giovanni Agnelli that the deal had
already been concluded. However, a dual announcement is due on Monday
following tomorrow's grand prix.
''The deal is complete when there is a signature,'' said Schumacher.
''There is a lot of talk and I want to stop it now. I am at Benetton,
not at Ferrari.''
The 26-year-old could finish only fourth behind Damon Hill in
yesterday's first qualifying for the race.
Alesi, too, did not have the best of days as he slammed his Ferrari
into a tyre wall while trying to improve on fifth position during the
first qualifying session. The 31-year-old was able to step from the
cockpit but was taken to hospital for a precautionary X-ray.
There were fears that Alesi, who claimed his first grand-prix triumph
after 91 attempts in Canada in June, had aggravated the injury that
sidelined him for two races last season. Alesi underwent tests at two
hospitals in Budapest after losing control at 120mph, but was given the
all-clear, though his car was badly damaged.
''Jean was on a very quick lap at the time of the accident,'' said
Ferrari's team chief, Jean Todt. ''It was a pity for him, but luckily he
escaped serious injury.''
Hill was in dominating mood yesterday as he began his bid to blast a
way back into the championship reckoning. He seized provisional pole
position with a sizzling drive and was joined on the front row in a
confidence-boosting Williams Renault double by David Coulthard.
The 34-year-old had a 0.6sec advantage over his younger team-mate, but
more importantly was more than a second quicker than Schumacher.
''That was a dominating performance,'' boasted Hill after clocking
1min 18.374sec at the Hungaroring.
''I need this kind of advantage if I am going to ensure a race
victory, and I know I have got to win as many races as possible between
now and the end of the season. We always seem to do well when we have
got our backs to the wall. It's not the best way -- to give yourself a
21-point disadvantage -- but I won't give up.''
Hill was delighted that Schumacher could finish only fourth-fastest --
behind Ferrari's Gerhard Berger -- in his Benetton, but is aware that
the world champion could hit back in today's second qualifying session.
''I was quite surprised about Michael's performance, but I expect him
to bounce back. I don't expect him to stay where he is, but if he does,
he will have a problem, because he would have to get past Gerhard as
well.''
The Williams duo found the perfect riposte just hours after learning
that Jacques Villeneuve seems to be on his way to the team after opting
to leave IndyCar at the end of this season.
Williams reportedly have an option on Villeneuve's services and were
impressed by the French Canadian's display during testing last week.
Hill, who has himself been offered #3m to join the Newman Haas IndyCar
set-up, said: ''All I am concentrating on is the championship, and this
race in particular.''
Coulthard said: ''All I know about it is what I have heard on the
news. Nothing has changed as far as I am concerned. The team have not
got options on us for next year so we are free to negotiate with
Williams and other teams. I think everything will fall into place when
Michael announces whether he is staying or going.
''I'm reasonably happy about being on the front row -- it's a good
start and I am sure I can challenge for pole tomorrow. It was much
quicker on the Saturday last year and I expect the same this time.''
Coulthard is concentrating this weekend on a victorious performance to
help him secure his future. ''I cannot see why I cannot go for a win
here,'' said the Scot.

TO DESCRIBE them as new kids on the block may go down like a meal of
fillet steak with raspberry ice cream. Billy Kirkwood, of former Rangers
fame, and Allan McGraw, that one-time man of many goals, come
face-to-face as far their teams are concerned at Tannadice today. One
lot came down from the premier division last season, the other came up
from the second.
The yardstick will be there for all to see -- and to try to measure a
league which will favour the bookmakers all the way down the line will
be almost impossible. In other words, don't touch the first-division
odds with a barge pole.
Kirkwood, despite his Rangers background, is the newest to what almost
is guaranteed to be the fiercest competition in senior Scottish football
this season. He was asked to pick up Dundee United from disaster last
season -- an impossible job.
Now he knows what faces him this season. Unfortunately for him, a
series of bans picked up by five of his top-team squad will not help his
team selection today. The crime list reads: Brian Welsh, Dave Bowman,
and Billy McKinlay suspended for one game, Grant Johnson for four, and
Christian Dailly for three. On top of that, Scott Crabbe is injured.
On the other side of the coin, there are five new players to step in
-- keeper Ally Maxwell, centre half Steven Pressley, Rab Shannon, and
Neil Caldwell and Sandy Robertson, former Rangers players like Pressley.
Kirkwood is not happy with the tag of being favourites to go straight
back to the premier division. ''We need a good start, and get out of the
losing habit of last season. It's the winning habit we need.''
That was something Morton enjoyed last season as they gained
promotion. It's not a problem for McGraw. In his quiet way, he assessed
thus: ''We have a more settled team this year. No-one will find it easy
in the first division.'' He will miss the experienced Rowan Alexander,
who is injured.
The Tannadice club's neighbours Dundee start off with a difficult job
against St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. They narrowly missed out on
promotion last year, and manager Jim Duffy -- who, despite reports, has
not been approached by Partick Thistle -- reckons that again the title
race will involve five or six teams. Mike Teasdale and Mark Hutchison
will be missing through injury.
Airdrie against Dunfermline could be played on any ground on the
planet and be a fiery affair. Today, it's at Broadwood. It will be hot
in the present heat.
Newcomers Dumbarton have Steven Gow and Colin McKinnon out, but will
be looking for Chic Charnley to turn on some style against Hamilton at
Boghead. Accies, on the other hand, are bound to miss the departed Peter
Duffield, who hit 23 goals for them last season.
Clydebank, with a reshuffled defence since Sean Sweeney moved to
Airdrie, have Craig Flannigan, Alan Lansdowne, and Paul Agnew missing
for their home match against a St Mirren side who will have Bobby Law
making his debut, but also have fitness doubts over Rikki Gillies and
Barry Lavety.

CLYDE manager Alex Smith,
one of the most experienced in the business, has strong views about
certain matters, especially the dangers of our larger and middleweight
clubs over-borrowing, and also the value of clubs in the lower divisions
as a breeding ground for future talent.
Nor is there a contradiction in his enterprising move, with the help
of an unnamed sponsor, to take Celtic veteran Charlie Nicholas to
Broadwood. As Smith observed: ''Clyde are a young side and they can only
benefit from playing in the same team as Charlie.''
The Bully Wee certainly need someone to apply a little more science to
the creation of chances.
Even without Nicholas, Clyde's visit to Ayr United, relegated last
season but presumably with ambitions to regain first-division status,
would have been seen as this afternoon's match of the day in the second
division.
It is high time that the patient Dumfries fans had a sustained league
campaign to follow, and manager Billy McLaren cannot be blamed for lack
of effort. Queens have been chasing former Falkirk and Dundee United
striker Dragutin Ristic, and already have recruited veteran Colin Harris
-- who scored on his debut against Queen's Park last week -- and Stuart
Wilson from Meadowbank as well as former Alloa keeper Jim Butter. Today
they are hosts to Terry Christie's Stenhousemuir, for whom 37-year-old
Eamonn Bannon will make a playing comeback.
Tommy Campbell's Forfar, last season's third-division champions, begin
with a home match against Steve Archibald's East Fife. Stirling Albion,
4-1 second favourites behind Ayr to win the division, open with a home
match against the other promoted side, Montrose. Berwick Rangers make
the long journey to relegated Stranraer, who promise to be difficult to
beat at this level.
The bookmakers' third-division favourites would have been unfamiliar
names a couple of seasons ago -- Ross County, Livingston, and Caley
Thistle, with the last two meeting at Inverness in the day's top game.
Jim Leishman's Livingston began the season with a Coca-Cola Cup
victory at Montrose, and time will tell whether they have more to offer
than the manager's high-profile enthusiasm. County open with a home
match against Queen's Park, who could struggle again along with Albion
Rovers and Cowdenbeath, respectively the hosts to John Brogan's
much-changed Arbroath and to Alloa.
Relegated Brechin will not find it easy at home to the gutsy East
Stirlingshire, who shocked Clyde at Broadwood.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
HUNTLY hit-man Martin Stewart was told yesterday that he faces an
agonising to see whether he will be fit for his favourite competition,
the Scottish Cup.
Stewart, who pipped Celt Pierre Van Hoojdonk to become last season's
top Scottish Cup scorer, damaged ankle ligaments when he fell from a
nursing home roof while at work.
Yesterday doctors told the 22-year-old joiner he would need at least
two months of intensive physiotherapy before he can begin to train
again.
Assuming that giant-killers Huntly book their place, it will be
touch-and-go for Stewart make it back for the December 9 cup kick-off.
Martin said yesterday: ''I'm desperate to play in the Scottish Cup
again this season, for obvious reasons. Doctors say there is a chance I
might make it back before Christmas, but right now I can't even put much
weight on my ankle.''
Stewart, rated one of the north's most lethal dangermen, works at
Huntly chairman Forbes Shand's building firm.
He netted 30 goals last season, finishing third-top Highland scorer
despite missing 13 matches.
The highlight was a strike against Dundee United in the Scottish Cup
fourth round, one of five goals during Huntly's giant-killing run.
Huntly are also without skipper Steve Lennox, who has a neck injury,
as the Highland League Cup gets under way for the fiftieth time.
The cup's golden jubilee opens with holders Cove Rangers away to
Fraserburgh. Huntly face another tough away test, against Keith, in the
first set of district group matches.
Last weekend's shock troops, Nairn, should receive a rapturous
reception in their first home game of the season against last year's
beaten finalists, Lossiemouth.

FIFTH TEST:
GRAEME HICK'S unbeaten century, his first against the West Indies,
elevated England towards a position of considerable eminence yesterday
at Trent Bridge with a total of 440, their highest of the series.
It was the perfect answer to chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth,
with whom he had a much publicised talk on the eve of this Cornhill
Test.
After having been dropped from the team at Old Trafford, Hick had a
point to prove and he did so in no uncertain manner.
He guided England's progress from the start of the second day, in
which Craig White come out to bat instead of the nightwatchman, Richard
Illingworth, whose X-ray had revealed a fractured right index finger.
Being a left-armer, the injury will not affect his bowling.
The tourists broke through early, claiming White's wicket within
half-an-hour after England had added just 12 to their overnight score of
227 for four.
After the excellent work of the England captain, Mike Atherton, on the
previous day, England's innings was faltering and it needed to be
restored again to a position of strength.
Hick took charge and his steady partnership with Jack Russell, who had
played a similar role at Old Trafford to check England's collapse, took
the total to 307 without further loss at lunch.
In the process, Hick reached a half-century in the penultimate over of
the morning session when he drove a full toss from leg-spinner Rajendra
Dhanraj to the long-on boundary.
Runs came more rapidly in the second session, when England added a
hundred for the loss two more wickets.
Hick's strokeplay was faultless. He missed no opportunity of taking
boundaries off the pacemen, Ian Bishop and Kenny Benjamin, from anything
that dropped short or was over-pitched.
His drives were perfectly timed and he cut and pulled with great
power.
Dhanraj was treated more severely. In one over he was swept in
exquisite style for two 4s, the first to square leg and the second a
little more fine to long leg; by now Hick was in his eighties.
England lost Russell (35) and Watkinson (24) with the scores on 323
and 380 but both batsmen had valuable stands, with Hick, of 84 and 57
respectively.
Shortly before tea Hick reached his third Test century with two
forceful strokes off the fast bowlers. He drove Walsh to the mid-off
boundary to get to 96, equalling his previous highest score against the
West Indies, and then, in the next over, Benjamin was elegantly driven
to mid-on.
That stroke also brought up England's 400 on the board and, with the
century, a great deal of relief and satisfaction to the Zimbabwe-born
batsman.
Benjamin wrapped up England's innings with successive deliveries which
removed Dominic Cork for 31 and uprooted Angus Fraser's off-stump.
England's lower order had given Hick excellent support, with the
sixth, seventh, and eighth wickets registering their highest stand on
this ground in a Test between these two sides.
In the 19 overs before close of play, the tourists made 25 without
loss.
The West Indies would have been wary to see off-spinner Mike Watkinson
achieve both bounce and turn from this wicket. With that, Illingworth
will look forward to his bowl today. Scoresboard:

<HEADLINE>Hauge picks up FIFA suspension</HEADLINE>

RUNE Hauge, the Norwegian agent who gave banned former Arsenal manager
George Graham his illegal transfer payments, was yesterday suspended by
FIFA.
The decision means that Hauge, one of Europe's best known players'
agents, will no longer be able to play any part in transfer deals.
But FIFA said Hauge's licence had not been withdrawn and his name
would remain on the list of FIFA players' agents until his case had been
fully investigated.
''The suspension takes effect immediately and Mr Hauge will remain
suspended until a final decision has been taken by the competent FIFA
bodies,'' FIFA said in a statement.
''The decision was taken on the basis of Mr Hauge's own statements
made to the hearing conducted in London by the Football Association in
the case which led to the suspension of Mr George Graham. FIFA had
received details of Mr Hauge's testimony from the FA.''
FIFA last month extended worldwide a one-year ban on Graham imposed by
the FA after he was found guilty of taking #425,000 in illegal transfer
payments.
The ban, which runs until June 30, 1996, followed a hearing in London
into misconduct concerning the transfers of Norwegian Pal Lydersen and
Danish internationalist John Jensen to Arsenal.
Graham claimed in his defence that he had ''never profited'' from what
he said were unsolicited payments made to him by Hauge and said he had
handed the money back to Arsenal.
* ST Johnstone yesterday reported an annual profit of #389,000.
But club chairman Geoff Brown noted that relegation from the premier
division last year prompted a #400,000 fall in gate receipts and only
the sale of players Billy Dodds, John Inglis, and Paul Wright kept the
balance sheet healthy.
Accounts released to shareholders also revealed that the club had
repaid a #300,000 loan from the chairman which financed the purchase of
striker Dodds from Dundee. Saints doubled their money when he moved to
Aberdeen.

<HEADLINE>Insurers fight for their life business as PEPs cash in</HEADLINE>

The amount we have been putting into life and pension plans has been
declining, but the slump in new policies taken out in 1994 was
unprecedented
PERSONAL equity plans have undoubtedly been the financial success
story of recent years.
Behind the popularity of PEPs lie their tax-free advantages and their
flexible role in long-term financial planning, and it is clear that, for
thousands of investors, they have replaced life insurance as the main
way of saving for the future.
Sales of unit trust PEPs have rocketed from under #600m in 1990 to
around #4000m in the last couple of years, and this is at a time when
both lump sum and regular contributions to life insurance policies have
been falling.
The amount we have been putting into life and pension plans has been
declining since the early eighties, but the slump in new policies taken
out during 1994 was unprecedented.
New yearly saving in life insurance policies dropped by more than 15%
to just under #1500m, while new single premium policies declined by in
excess of 16.5% to just under #9300m.
If the public is to be persuaded that buying insurance and pensions is
still valid then some radical changes need to be made, according to the
Association of British Insurers (ABI).
The ABI has started to lobby the Government, ahead of November's
Budget, with plans to revitalise the flagging fortunes of life insurance
companies.
In particular it wants the tax perks available to PEPs extended to
life insurance too. ''Tax policy should not treat different savings
instruments in different ways,'' says the ABI's Mark Boleat.
''If tax advantages are to be available for long-term savings then
these should be available whatever channel is chosen.''
The ABI wants investment growth within a PEP life policy to be free of
tax, with the proceeds paid out tax-free as well.
Of course, the proceeds of most regular premium life insurance
policies are tax-free now in the hands of investors. But insurance
company tax has been deducted from investment growth over the years and
this cannot be reclaimed by individuals, even if they are not liable to
pay tax themselves.
This means a range of assets held in a life policy can never grow by
as much as the same group of investments held within, say, a unit trust
PEP. That would change if the Government decided that a certain amount
of investment each year could qualify for tax-free growth, whatever type
of ''wrapper'' was put around it.
Another important reason why savers haven't been signing up for life
insurance policies is the daunting prospect of having to commit
themselves to a certain level of premium for many, many years.
Agreeing to this sort of financial commitment just does not fit in
with the uncertain employment patterns many people face these days.
To meet demands for more flexible types of plans, the ABI is keen to
get rid of the harsher tax treatment doled out to so-called
''non-qualifying'' policies.
These are policies where only a single premium is paid -- investment
bonds are the prime example -- or where premiums are not paid on a
regular basis or for a certain length of time and can be subject to tax.
Single premium investment bonds are usually taken out solely for
investment growth -- not as a way of protecting your dependents against
financial loss.
They are are often sold on the understanding that a ''tax-free''
income can be taken each year, but that may only be storing up trouble
for the future.
Income taken from the bond is added to the investment gains you make
when the bond finally pays out. This amount is then added to your other
income for the year, and you could be subject to an extra tax bill of
15% if the total takes you into the higher rate tax band. That currently
starts at a yearly income of #24,300.
If the category of ''non-qualifying'' policies was scrapped, investors
would be able to alter the amount and frequency of their life insurance
premiums much more easily without running into tax problems -- making
policies much more adaptable to changing financial circumstances and
needs and much more competitive with PEPs.
The ABI would also like the Government to change the rules so that
pension savings can be used in a variety of ways.
The bulk of pension contributions can only be used to provide an
income in old age, but knowing that a generous pension is due to be paid
at age 60 will not be much help to someone who is diagnosed with cancer
at 56.
The ABI proposes that we should be able to use the money built up in
personal and company pension schemes to meet a variety of needs.
In the future this could mean that we will be able to use our pension
fund money to pay for long-term care, permanent health insurance to
provide us with an income if we are unable to work, or to pay out a
large lump sum if we're unfortunate enough to suffer a serious or
critical illness such as a heart attack or cancer.

THE gloom which settled around Doncaster following the news that the
St Leger had lost its sponsor, lifted yesterday when it was announced
that the world's oldest classic will be backed by the recruitment
company, Pertemps.
Financial difficulties forced the previous backer to pull out, leaving
the course executive with the task of finding new sponsors with less
than five weeks to go before this year's event.
That this has been achieved within a week emphasises the positive
attitude of th course's executive.
''Pertemps informed us of their interest on Tuesday,'' said Doncaster
marketing executive Simon Carr. ''We invited them to the course and
concluded the deal. It means that this year's added prize-money will be
#200,000 but we are looking towards a minimum value for the race of
#250,000 by 1998.''
* PRESENTING is the logical choice in today's Geoffrey Freer Stakes at
Newbury. John Gosden's colt is consistent and looks to be at his peak.
He finished an excellent third to Lammtarra in the Derby, form which
took some knocks earlier in the summer but has since developed a very
solid look to it.
Presenting did not run again until the Newmarket July meeting and
Gosden felt the colt was not 100% wound up for the Princess of Wales's
Stakes. Presenting acquitted himself well and it is hard to see him
being beaten here.

* MARK Rimmer took the riding honours at Folkestone yesterday when he
landed a double on Western Venture and Time of Times, but it could have
been a three-timer.
Indeed, Rimmer had thought he had ridden his first treble in this
country when taking Petraco into the winners enclosure. But the
photograph after the Grafty Green Handicap showed that Red Admiral,
ridden by Nicola Howarth, had beaten Rimmer's mount by a head.

PRESENTING, third in this season's Epsom Derby, was impressive when
rediscovering winning ways in Goodwood's Gordon Stakes, but Don Corleone
looks an attractive bet to reverse the form with the favourite in
Newbury's Geoffrey Freer Stakes this afternoon.
One of the toughest horses in training, the selection showed fine
acceleration to beat Fahal in a Listed race at Haydock last month.
Although he lacked Presenting's speed at Goodwood, he was running on
at the finish and should be better suited by today's extended trip on a
more galloping track.
Burooj is taking a step up in class, but also should be suited by
conditions and can run a big race.
Amazing Bay, a smart juvenile out of Ian Balding's stable, can take
the St Hugh's Stakes. A half sister to Lochsong's dam, she has had wins
here and at York, both over six furlongs.
Outpaced by Almaty over the minimun trip last time, she should, none
the less, have the legs of these rivals over an extended five furlongs.
Top Cat rates as the chief danger.
Ripon's feature race, the Rothman's Challenge, can go to the
lightly-raced Hand Craft. Having scored on the all-weather in February,
he was rested until July when he put in a promising effort at Chepstow.
He had obviously come on for that run when comfortably winning at
Nottingham recently and should improve again.
Kindergarten Boy was a disappointing favourite last time but should
benefit from the return to nine furlongs.
There are a couple of interesting races on the day's two National Hunt
cards. Stratford's William Hill Chase features a remarkable number of
horses who have recently lost their form, and Northern Optimist should
have no trouble repeating his course-and-distance win of last month.
At Bangor, Jewel Thief looks harshly treated for his recent narrow win
at Worcester, and the progressive Greenfinch can be backed to take
advantage in the Showtime Hurdle.
* HARAYIR could strengthen Hamdan Al Maktoum's hand in the Celebration
Mile later this month after having bounced back to form in the
Hungerford Stakes at Newbury yesterday.
After her first success since the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket in May,
the filly could join the John Dunlop-trained Shahid at Goodwood. Harayir
was never seriously pressed in yesterday's race.

<HEADLINE>Bonthrone banks on memories Ferguson's United in tribute to a Fife legend</HEADLINE>

UNLIKE some of his contemporaries, and many of his succcessors, Jimmy
Bonthrone will never need to hire a team of accountants to protect the
riches he has amassed from a long football career, but he is able to
laugh all the way to the memory bank, and maybe that makes him wealthier
in the long run.
When Manchester United run on to Bayview tomorrow afternoon to meet
East Fife in a testimonial for Bonthrone, it will be the first time in
50 years as a professional that this likeable veteran of play and
management will have had a benefit match to recognise his contribution
to the game.
After a career spent mostly with East Fife, with whom he was player,
manager, and general manager spanning 32 years of his 66, Bonthrone at
last is being given the accolade that many headline stealers have
collected when barely out of their apprenticeships.
If he bears any grudges, however, he must keep them tucked away in one
of those memory banks that is not for publication. None was even
remotely visible when we spoke this week at the ground where he has
become as much a fixture as that marvellous misnomer, Bayview.
It might be possible to capture a peek at the bay with a 100ft ladder
and 50-50 vision, but let us not carp; Bayview is Bayview and the lofty
millionaire stars of Old Trafford will not be allowed by their manager
to treat it with other than respect.
It is perhaps typical that Alex Ferguson who, whatever else may be
said of him, has a deep regard for his roots, agreed to bring his United
side to Fife for this special occasion. The result is that all 5300
tickets for the game have been sold for some time. Bonthrone is thrilled
to bits.
It is a year now since he finally succumbed to retirement to live in
Kirkcaldy, giving up the post he had held for the last 15 years at
Methil. He describes that as ''general manager, commercial manager and
funeral director,'' the latter a kind of official mourner on behalf of
the club.
The Fergie connection goes back a long way, to days when Bonthrone was
one of the official coaches at the Largs courses when Ferguson, then a
Falkirk player, first appeared.
''To be honest, I looked at him with those elbows flailing and put him
down as another Glasgow hooligan,'' says Bonthrone, ''but when he came
back for a refresher course I was impressed. I was even more impressed
when I could see he was articulate about the game.''
That impression stayed with him, and when he took over as manager from
Eddie Turnbull, to whom he had been assistant, with Aberdeen, he made up
his mind that if Jim McLean would not come as his No.2, then Alex would
be the choice. McLean did not want to let his mentor at Dundee, John
Prentice, down and elected to stay where he was, although he did move
eventually and did all right. That left Bonthrone ready to ask Fergie to
join at Pittodrie around 10 years before he eventuallly did.
''He came to Pittodrie playing for Falkirk, and I thought I would have
a word with him after the game. But he got sent off inside the first 10
minutes and I decided that I couldn't have someone who was that
irresponsible.''
However, Bonthrone grew to admire the man's talents again, especially
as he met him often enough in Fife, where one of Fergie's closest pals,
the late Andy Matthew, brought them together.
His first wage with East Fife, with whom he spent 11 years as a
player, was to be #8 a week, but on the day he signed, he discovered
that two of the older players were on a pound more. He promptly returned
to manager Scot Symon, made his case, and was given the extra quid.
His recall of the great Methil team of the era, not unexpectedly,
concentrates heavily on Charlie ''Legs' Fleming, the goalscorer and
character supreme of the side.
''When I went into the team, Scot Symon explained what to expect.
''You will be wearing No.10 as inside left, but you will also at times
be left half, right half and inside left, because you have the stamina
to go up and down the field. You will also see a No.8 and maybe wonder
what the hell he is doing, but 85 mimutes might go by when he will get
the ball, run a few feet and belt it into the net. You will get your
bonus, I will get my bonus and the punters will go home happy.''
Two seasons were spent at Dens Park, where his remarkable versatility
helped them to stay up.
He then moved to Stirling Albion, where his rescue expertise was again
fully utilised by another legendary Fergusson -- Tam of the double s --
who once told the lads, thumping his walking stick on the floor
menacingly, as they prepared to go out for a game that would decide if
they were to be relegated: ''Now don't you dare get relegated, don't do
it or you will get paid the minimum I am allowed next season, #3 a week.
Your bonus, by the way, will be #50 if you win.''
Bonthrone, who added that Stirling paid him higher wages than any
other club, #28 a week, finished his career with Queen of the South.
Eventually he was taken to Pittodrie as coach alongside Eddie
Turnbull, and the two of them steered the side to the Scottish Cup in
1970, and he was in charge when they won the Drybrough Cup.
He is specially proud of two things: that he went through his entire
career without being booked or sent off; and that he played in seven
different positions for East Fife. He deserves a good day out.

SOUTH Western Electricity (Sweb) thought it had a white knight
yesterday in the form of neighbouring power distributor Southern
Electric (Sel) intent on saving it from US bidder Southern Co, but to
everyone's surprise Sel suddenly had second thoughts in the late
afternoon.
Sweb confirmed in the morning that it was in talks with Sel over a bid
at a price of over #10, which would roundly trump the #9 offered by
Southern Co. It would be subject to the agreement of the electricity
regulator, the Office of Fair Trading and the Department of Trade and
Industry, as are all such bids.
Then Sel evidently received a negative reaction from the regulator,
Professor Stephen Littlechild, which prompted it to break off the talks
because of the ''unclear regulatory position'', though it remains keenly
interested in bidding.
An Sel bid for Sweb would be the first merger within the English
distributors, the other offers being from companies outside the sector
-- ScottishPower being in a separate category.
There would be clear competition issues given that the number of
companies covering southern England would be reduced, which would become
more important once the market was fully deregulated.
Competition issues are less likely to arise from an outsider bid such
as Hanson's for Eastern, because the latter would retain its separate
identity. ScottishPower's bid for Manweb is slightly different in that
ScottishPower is obviously not a complete outsider, though Manweb would
remain as a separate company.
Professor Littlechild would also not welcome a contraction in the
number of companies as this would reduce the scope for making
comparisons, which are important when assessing performance and price
caps.
On the other hand, a merger would be good for consumers because the
savings it produces could be passed in part to them in lower prices.
Consumers are less likely to receive any benefit from their
electricity supplier being controlled by an outsider intent on squeezing
profits out of its electricity subsidiary.
Being part of a financially astute conglomerate like Hanson will mean
it will be even harder for the regulator to find out how Eastern is
performing so that he can adjust his pricing formula.
Mergers between distributors would enhance monopoly positions, but if
this could be properly policed then there could be real benefits to
consumers. So it is a dilemma for Professor Littlechild.
The distributors have so far rather played down the possibility of
rationalisation within the industry by saying that the savings to be
achieved would be outweighed by the costs of putting two companies
together. Another unstated consideration is that one set of directors
would be excluded from the gravy train.
That combining two contiguous regions would not yield worthwhile
savings has always seemed spurious. An amalgamation of Sel and Sweb, for
example, would enable one head office to be eliminated entirely and
billing and maintenance operations could be combined.
Analysts reckon putting Sweb and Sel together would yield savings of
around #50-#60m, though part of this would be absorbed in
rationalisation and merger costs. It would also make for larger
purchasing power when independent generators are looking for customers.
The implications for competition in southern England could be the
perfect excuse for Professor Littlechild to refer the whole Sweb bid
situation to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which would, in
turn, give the Office of Fair Trading a convenient peg to mount a
monopolies investigation into all the bids in the sector, including
ScottishPower's offer for Manweb.
A decision on a monopolies reference will have to be made by the end
of the month. It is to be hoped that it will be made to clear up once
and for all the criteria for bids within the sector, any conditions
which are deemed appropriate to protect consumers, and generally to
establish how far rationalisation in the sector should be allowed to go.
These factors can, of course, be considered by the regulator, but
Professor Littlechild's track record is not exactly brilliant and it is
time another body had a close look at the industry. Professor
Littlechild would have a major input to a monopolies probe.

SHEEP farmers will begin to receive payments of advances on the Sheep
Annual Premium at the end of this month, the Scottish office announced
yesterday.
The announcement came just as it appeared that farmers north of the
Border were working up a head of steam over the fact that many of their
English and Welsh counterparts had received their money in July.
The Scottish Office Agriculture Department denied that there had ever
been a promise that they would pay out in July.
Stewart Whiteford, livestock convener for the National Farmers' Union
of Scotland, said he was delighted that the Scottish office had
responded positively to the union's request that the payment date for
SAP should be brought forward.
If Scots were paid later than English and Welsh sheep producers, they
could find themselves at a financial disadvantage when they went to buy
replacement stock, he said.
The Earl of Lindsay, Scottish Agriculture Minister, forecast that the
bulk of the eligible claims would be completed by the middle of next
month -- which would give a completion date about three months ahead of
what was achieved last year when problems with the new computer system
were blamed for delays.
The department has always maintained that there is no commitment to
keep SAP payment dates in Scotland in line with those applying in
England and Wales.
Lord Lindsay said yesterday that he was aware of the argument that all
producers should receive their payments at the same time. ''Given the
separate administrative systems, the relative size of the hill sector
and the larger proportion of complex sheep producer groups in Scotland,
this is simply not practicable,'' he said.
He pointed out that European Commission regulations governing SAP
payments provided a wide period during which producers could be paid
advances. Sheep farmers within the EU might get their payments at
different times both among and within member states.
Support schemes involving direct government subsidies would be worth
more than #332m to Scottish farmers this year, said Lord Lindsay. ''With
the limited resources at its disposal, my department must balance the
effort across every scheme -- and the Scottish hill sheep and hill
cattle sectors are disproportionately large.''
In some years, he said, the Scottish Office had paid the bulk of some
sheep and cattle subsidies ahead of the Ministry of Agriculture south of
the Border -- ''so there are swings and roundabouts.''
Last year the Scottish Office agriculture department made the first
SAP payments at the end of October, and the bulk of the payments were
completed by the end of December. The then agriculture minister, Sir
Hector Monro, promised that claims would be processed more quickly this
year.
Farmers will receive a combined first and second advance payment which
will be worth #12.34 per eligible ewe (60% of the total). There will
also be a 90% advance of the Less Favoured Area supplement.

<HEADLINE>Scots bird stocks better as grouse season opens. Set-aside is the key to greater numbers</HEADLINE>

AS the guns line up for the Glorious Twelfth -- the grouse shooting
season which begins today -- research by a recently established farm
trust aims to show how more farmers and landowners can develop game as a
cash prop.
Meanwhile, breeders report bird stocks are better in Scotland than in
other parts of the UK.
Land set-aside payments provide one of the major keys to the
development by enabling the creation of conservation headlands and
beetle banks, which provide both cover and an insect-rich diet for
chicks.
Established in 1992 to investigate systems of combining practical
farming with the conservation of wildlife, including game, on the
780-acre Loddington Estate in Leicestershire, the Allerton Research and
Educational Trust has already demonstrated an increase in all game
species as well as improved crop yields.
''Between 1992 and 1994 there has been something like a five-fold
increase in pheasants in terms of young stock, while the grey and redleg
partridge has also been increasing and looks quite promising,'' said Dr
Nigel Boatman, the trust's chief executive.
''Winter hare counts have also shown an increase and these may need to
be thinned out shortly as they are reaching optimum density.''
Shooting has been carried out to a limited extent, but the trust is
still intent on building up numbers first. ''The great advantage of this
system is that they are wild birds, and this provides better shooting
for the skilled shot. Bags may tend to be lower but they pay more.''
Existing ponds have also been restored and stocked with wild brown
trout, while new wetlands have been created incorporating a snipe bog,
flight pond and reedbed.
Dr Boatman makes a point of showing that with heavy clay land and a
rolling countryside, as well as a disused railway embankment, the estate
is far from ideal, either as a farm or a sportsman's paradise.
''Farming conditions are by no means ideal, which is important,
because if the principles of integrated farming and wildlife can be
shown to work at Loddington then there is hope for every farmer who
wants to attempt the same no matter what the conditions on his land.''
The project, which is being run in association with the Game
Conservancy, is not just geared to game but to the overall concept of
flora and fauna conservation. Old woodlands are being improved and new
ones created; pheasant-friendly fencing erected to keep in the 300 ewes;
old hedgerows are being renovated and new ones planted.
There has been a major investment in land drainage. This has helped
boost yields of the mainly winter sewn arable crop rotation of wheat,
barley, oilseed rape, beans and linseed. Gross margin for the arable and
sheep last year was #145,000, against which the total profit foregone on
the overall research, education and conservation management project was
put at #4500.
Dr Boatman admits that the greatest contribution to the game habitat
has been made by set-aside. At the same time this has also been the
greatest cost, with special seed mixes for the conservation headlands
and beetle banks, and attendant complications in management.
Good bird stocks seem destined to make the start of the grouse
shooting season significantly more glorious in Scotland than in the rest
of the UK.
Breeders in the south of Scotland yesterday reported numbers to be
strong, while the central Highlands and eastern Scotland are hoping for
their best season for many years.
The upturn is believed to be due to the mild winter, although in some
areas prospects are less positive, with stocks in Perthshire falling by
10% on many moors.
However, poor winter weather and disease have dwindled the grouse
population in many other parts of the UK, with upland England affected
worst.
Yesterday the game conservancy trust reported disease from ticks had
caused stocks on the Yorkshire moors to fall significantly, and a lack
of snow cover during the cold winter had left those in the southern
Dales down 10%.
Northumberland reported the best regional prospects, with grouse
numbers up 25%, but studies on Welsh moors highlighted a heavy loss due
to predators.
The trust's upland research director, Dr Peter Robinson, said:
''Overall, 1995 will not be a bumper year for grouse.
''Some average prospects are to be found, but weather, disease and low
spring stocks have conspired to make 1995 less of a building year than
many people first hoped.''
However, animal welfare groups claimed the demand for prize grouse
leads to the destruction of other wildlife.
Advocates for Animals director, Les Ward, said the sport led many
peregrine falcons and eagles, which prey on grouse, to be shot, poisoned
or trapped by gamekeepers on a regular basis.
He added: ''The ritual of causing suffering and death to hundreds and
thousands of grouse, the often illegal and callous slaughter of
predatory birds and the contamination of an environment with lead is
totally unacceptable and must be brought to an end.''

TWENTY years after the first production of Travesties it's interesting
to see what time has done to the jokes which Tom Stoppard used to play
with time. The ahistorical caricatures of Lenin and Joyce, the debonair
interweaving of Oscar Wilde's old Earnest with Stoppard's new one, the
light-hearted toying with pre-cold war ideologies: it's all so . . .
seventies. How post-modernism has aged, you think.
As the play is about tricks and slips of language it is vital that the
performance is precise, since characters are given precious little space
to develop. 4 x 4 Theatre Company fall down on this basic point. Lack of
perfect characterisation, even as parody, does more harm here than it
would with a simpler play. Uniform costumes of white T-shirts and black
jeans do not help.
When they play it for laughs, however, the production jumps. And
Stoppard's verbal jugglery is still a marvel to behold. Despite
demanding a huge amount from a young cast, it shines out.

SUCH costumes this show has! And tons of them. Cowboy shirts with
rippling fringes. Pointy-toe boots. Awesome stetsons. And country and
western music's undoubted suit-of-suits, a gleaming white job with black
musical notes embroidered in black up legs and sleeves.
Such songs, too! Yup, Hank Williams wrote 'em 'fore he passed away
aged 29 on New Year's Day, 1953. Drink and drugs killed Hank. Died on
the road, en route to a gig, in the back of a car. Going somewhere;
going nowhere fast. Them ol' lonesome, love-sick, hell-bound
hillbilly-blues.
''No matter how I struggle and strive, I'll never get out of this
world alive.'' Why did Hank feel this way? What horrors drove his art?
This show only hints at answers. No room for much script in among the
costume-changes, you see. Sketchy drama; brilliant songs.

THE final day of an immensely enjoyable, but not-long-enough jazz
festival was peppered with magical, musical moments -- courtesy of two
bands. The first was a trio led by mirthful maestro Marty Grosz and the
superb, and versatile, cornettist Bob Barnard. Their afternoon set on
Thursday was a display of world-class musicianship and sheer
entertainment; rhythm guitarist Grosz was in particularly good form as
he related the story behind Just a Gigolo which he proceeded to sing in
German and English.
Other highlights of the day -- and the festival -- were provided by
France's Hot Antic Jazz Band, whose happy, peppy playing deservedly won
them bigger crowds as the week progressed.

Sarah Hemming meets actress Angela Pleasence who endured a physical
and technical ordeal, including burial up to her neck, to master her
latest role
THE living-room table in Angela Pleasence's cottage is piled with
eye-catching yellow and black posters for Happy Days. Each carries a
rather eerie photo of Pleasence in the play, hands raised as if to claw
her way off the paper, and the words, ''Pleasence at the Pleasance''.
She grimaces at the pun and points out that it is a necessary evil: you
have to use all you can to make an impact in that vast cultural jungle
that is the Edinburgh Fringe -- particularly if you are taking Samuel
Beckett, a rarer fixture than once he was.
Winnie, the central character in Beckett's Happy Days, is a massive
challenge for any actress. She spends the first half of the play buried
up to her waist in an earth mound, and the second embedded up to her
neck. From this static position she conducts a virtual monologue for one
and a half hours, written in that precise, splintered, and circular
style peculiar to Beckett. It is a funny and immensely moving play. In
the character of Winnie, staving off despair by her stoical and cheerful
immersion in meaningless rituals, Beckett posits the absurdity of human
life. ''The writing is so remarkable,'' says Pleasence. ''So precise. He
marries the profound and the everyday in the most extraordinary way.''
But while she admires the universal in the play, she has also been
struck by Beckett's prescience. Working on the character of Winnie, she
was reminded of the plight of people sleeping rough, who see passers-by
approach, perhaps stop and then pass on, leaving them isolated again.
''You get a sense of just wasteland in the play,'' she says.
''Wilderness, emptiness -- she says those words so often.''
But while Happy Days is a part of depth and brilliance for a
middle-aged actress -- a rarity in itself -- learning it is an
extraordinary physical and technical ordeal. ''The play's success really
has to do with exactitude,'' Pleasence points out. ''He always uses the
mot juste. And when you perform it, you should honour that writing with
the same exactness.''
This is, however, easier said than done. Billie Whitelaw played Winnie
in 1979 and in her new autobiography, Billie Whitelaw ... Who He? she
writes about the enormous difficulty of learning the part. Whitelaw made
herself a cocoon at the top of her house and immersed herself in the
play for several months: ''I knew I'd have to learn all those 'Oh wells'
and 'Ah wells' littered about the script, and in their correct order --
every dot, every dot, dot, dot, every comma and semi-colon,'' Whitelaw
writes. She also recalls that Beckett described the play as a ''sonata
for voice and movement'' -- every fiddly little action by Winnie had to
be timed not just to a specific word, but to a certain syllable of a
word.
Pleasence, whose acclaimed performance at the French Institute last
year was the first performance in London of the play since Whitelaw did
it, confesses it took her six months to learn -- ''I think Billie and I
had very similar experiences learning it''.
The performance demands stamina as well as precision. It calls for the
sort of intensity and involvement that Pleasence brings to her work, but
offers no respite.
She practices the art of monologue -- ''I talk all the time, not
stopping, driving people mad. I had a phone call with Alan Rickman
recently when I just rang him and talked non-stop for about five minutes
before drawing breath'' -- she keeps fit by walking her dog for hours in
the woods and she has a cast iron regime for the run itself: ''Pasta at
four o'clock. That's all I shall eat for a month. When I was doing it at
the French Institute I ate an enormous plate of spaghetti at 4pm and
another enormous plateful after the show -- and I lost weight.''
This is an alarming idea. If she were to lose weight now one fears she
might disappear into her mound entirely. A small, bird-like figure with
piercing blue eyes, when we meet she is barefoot, wearing jeans and a
Greenpeace T-shirt. She is at once very welcoming and very wary. ''I am
obsessively private,'' she says.
She shies away from all public talk about her family and her
relationship with her father, the actor Donald Pleasence, who died
earlier this year. It is clear though that her admiration and affection
for him were enormous.
''I'm one of the great believers in the ripple effect -- you have to
care about your own, those around you -- and it might spread,'' she
said.
She recalls trying to put her principles into practice while at
school. During one holiday job in a local store she quietly did her bit
by charging anyone needy a penny an item, no matter what it was (she was
never found out -- her mental arithmetic was too good). She laughs now
at her Robin Hood efforts, but clearly the instinct for social justice
has not left her.
It seems appropriate then, that a large portion of the budget for her
show in Edinburgh has come in the shape of donations from friends,
family and fans. She is anxious to stress their generosity, keen to make
it clear that without such benefactors, she would not be able to mount
her production.
As the time approaches, she admits she is nervous -- and nervous about
being nervous. ''If you're tense, your voice becomes all small and
strained and awful.
''I think all I can do is remember the words of wisdom my old man gave
me. The only piece of advice he gave me when I left drama school was:
'As long as you know your lines, you'll be alright.' All I can do is
follow that.''

INDIA has had stock markets for a fair number of years now, but it has
only recently had much of a profile on the emerging markets scene.
Thrills and spills on the Bombay exchange a few years ago coupled with
less than straightforward taxation arrangements tended to put off
overseas investors. But the scene has been changing and, perhaps most
important of all, the political and economic climate has become more
encouraging.
Two single country investment trusts specialising in India were
launched last year, one by Flemings and the other by Lazards, raising
more than #100m between them.
Biggest is Fleming India Investment Trust. Its investment manager,
Jonathan Boyer, who also runs India funds for the New York and Hong Kong
markets, has recently been in the UK talking to a number of
institutional investors.
The trust shares, issued at 100p, are currently changing hands at
around 75p. There was, however, the almost inevitable issue of free
warrants -- at the rate of one for every five shares -- and as these
stand at getting on for 40p, the fall in overall value for original
investors is relatively modest.
Clearly the managers and investors had been hoping there would be no
fall at all. Warrants are issued with the intention that the value put
on them by the market should counteract the fall in asset value of up to
around 5p a share, once the cost of floating the company is taken into
account. However, the investor in emerging markets has to accept that
fluctuations in prices and assets are even more likely than in developed
markets. And the current price gives a more attractive opportunity than
at the original floatation.
Looking at the Indian scene, Mr Boyer is not hoisting the ''fill your
boots'' signal, but he does say: ''I think we have seen the worst. This
is a quite interesting time for India. The basic message is that shares
will not go up in a straight line, at least not yet. But I think we will
be trading in a slightly higher range between now and the end of next
year.''
What has been happening recently is a recovery of three or four
percentage points (in Sterling terms) in Indian market indices -- and a
similar movement in the prices of the two trusts -- after a fall of
around 30% compared with the peak in September last year.
Mr Boyer says the fall came ''largely because of liquidity problems''.
A spate of new issues resulted in an over-supply of shares. In addition
to this, inflation rose towards the end of last year to a peak of 12%
and the government had been making a poor showing in elections.
Monetary policy has been tightened in the first half of this year,
although the knock-on effect has so far been felt more in the stock
market than in the economy.
This year Indian markets have had to cope with ''just about the worst
of all worlds -- tight money, rising interest rates, and political
uncertainty''. More recently, though, inflation has eased back and the
market has rallied.
Mr Boyer points out that the Indian authorities are having to grapple
with two problems -- inflation and a fiscal deficit. After a
deliberately tough stand on inflation for nine months, he thinks the
policy direction may now shift. Next month or early October will see one
of the twice yearly reviews of credit policy. That, he expects, will
result in a relaxation of monetary policy ahead of a general election
which is expected to be called for the first quarter of next year.
The election date has some significance for share prices. Experience
of the last five general elections has shown that the market does not
perform particularly well ahead of an announcement setting the date for
a general election. Mr Boyer anticipates an announcement by the end of
this year, and adds: ''Historically, the market performs well once the
date is set.''
Peering into the crystal ball, he says current opinion is that the
election will not give a decisive result for any one party, leaving
India with a coalition government. But he does not expect a change in
the balance of political power will be sufficient to upset the moves for
economic liberalisation started nearly four years ago. ''There is bound
to be a political consensus that economic liberalisation and
deregulation is the only way forward.''
The worst case scenario, in his opinion, would be a very fragmented
coalition which could see the reform process slowed down significantly,
but he rates that sort of result as only a 10% possibility.
India is the second largest emerging market after China with a
population of getting on for 880 million and more than 7000 quoted
companies. The Bombay stock exchange is the oldest in Asia, although it
is only recently that settlement and custodial arrangements have been
improving. Mr Boyer notes that the difficulty in settlement of local
shares has been one of the factors making overseas investors nervous
about the country.
The fundamentals of the market, he feels, have also been getting more
attractive. The forecast price-earnings ratio for the year to March 1996
is 13 and growth in earnings per share is predicted to reach 25% in the
current year and maybe 20% next year.
Because of the approaching election, the market is not expected to go
shooting upwards. But Mr Boyer maintains that if you take a stake in
India in this calendar year ''you should be able to look towards a much
better year in 1996''.
With all emerging markets, investors should only invest money they are
willing to risk. But, if only because of its size, India has to be
thought about if emerging markets are attractive to you. The India
content of specialist Far Eastern trusts ranges from nil to around 7.5%,
and the Save &amp; Prosper Emerging Markets unit trust has 8.1% of its funds
there, according to its latest report.

CUT-backs in state benefits for the sick have led to a growing
interest in health insurance. One of the best-selling types of
health-related policy in recent years has been critical illness
insurance, which pays out a lump sum if you suffer a serious illness
such as cancer or a heart attack.
More insurance companies have started offering these policies. As
Roger Edwards, product manager at Scottish Provident, points out:
''Critical illness insurance was a natural development of life
assurance. When life assurance was first introduced anyone who
contracted a serious illness was likely to die very quickly. Nowadays,
thanks to advances in medical science, many people stand a good chance
of recovery.
''If you have a critical illness policy, the money it pays out can
give you a valuable financial breathing space. It can be useful in
various ways -- to cover extra expenses associated with your disability
or to pay off your mortgage or cover other outgoings,'' he says.
Many insurers now argue that critical illness cover is just as major a
financial requirement as life assurance and for some people it matters
even more. The chances of suffering a serious illness are relatively
high. Official statistics show that the risk of being off work for more
than three years due to serious illness is three times greater than the
risk of death before retirement.
For families, the financial impact of such an event could be just as
bad as the death of a breadwinner. For single people or those without
dependents, who might not normally bother with life assurance, the
financial effect of a serious illness could be every bit as devastating.
Even in the short time that policies have been available many people
have already benefited. Allied Dunbar, one of the first companies to
start selling this type of insurance in the late eighties, has paid out
more than #21m to almost 500 claimants. The average age of claimant is
42 with the average pay-out #42,400. The youngest person to claim was a
20-year-old who suffered a brain tumour.
Overall, cancer has been the most common reason for women to claim
under the critical illness policies. The disease accounts for 66% of
men's claims, followed closely by heart attacks.
The medical conditions covered by critical illness policies vary from
company to company. A recent survey by Money Management magazine found
that some companies list more than 20 different illnesses. All policies,
though, cover the six ''core'' critical illnesses which are the ones
which also tend to give rise to most claims. They are strokes, cancer,
heart attack, kidney failure, major organ transplants and coronary
artery by-pass surgery.
Most policies also cover multiple sclerosis and total permanent
disability, although definitions of this condition vary. Some insurers
say you must be unable to do your own occupation or one for which you
are suited by education or training, while others have the stiffer
requirement that you must be unable to perform any occupation
whatsoever.
Other diseases and illnesses covered include such things as heart
valve replacement, loss of hearing, speech or sight, severe burns and
Parkinson's disease. Aids is normally excluded, although some companies
make an exception if the virus is picked up from a blood transfusion or
as a result of employment in the medical or emergency services.
Some offer a two-tier system with a basic policy and one which
provides extra cover. Scottish Provident adopts this approach. Among the
extra conditions it includes is Alzheimer's disease.
The policies come in various forms. Some combine critical illness and
life assurance cover. They pay out either on the diagnosis of the
illness or on death. While others, such as those from Axa Equity and Law
and Sun Alliance, allow you to spilt the pay-out, with part paid at the
onset of an illness and the rest on death. Other policies apply to
critical illness only; so if you die or do not survive for a certain
period, usually 30 days, they do not pay out. They either run for a
fixed term or throughout life.
Typically, policies can be taken out up to the age of 60 and some
companies will accept you up to the age of 75. Premiums normally start
at #10 to #20 a month. The amount of cover you get for your money will
depend on your age and the type of policy chosen.
At Scottish Provident, for example, the minimum premium of #20 a month
under a standard policy would give a 35-year-old man basic critical
illness cover of #27,300. If he wanted extra conditions included, the
amount of cover would reduce to #24,000, and if he wanted life assurance
on top, the cover would come down to #21,250.
Unfortunately, critical illness policies cannot be compared on cost
alone because of the variation in what is provided. If you want to take
one out, you should seek the help of an independent financial adviser.
He or she can tell you which insurer has the right one to meet your
needs.

IMAGINE a cross between a Carry On Up Pompeii version of Antony and
Cleopatra, Tom Stoppard's Arcadia, News at Ten and Maggie Thatcher in St
Joan mode and you might just get some idea of the tone Nick Dear finds
to describe the rise and fall of the Syrian city of Palmyria in AD 267
and its war-like, contradictory queen, Zenobia.
Palmyria, under Zenobia's rule rose up against its Roman yoke but also
became a centre of learning and science before being ransacked and
reduced to rubble by one of its own. A story full of paradoxes and rich
themes it is told in a mixture of styles -- classical formality,
rhetorical flourishes, crude modern obscenities -- that ultimately
defeat their own purpose.
Mike Ockrent's disciplined, highly efficient, gorgeously designed
production manages to stave off such doubts for some time, but this is
an historical satire that takes just too many bites out of too many
cherries for its own good.

BRIEFLY the plot. The Archangel Raphael (a wryly disconsolate Daniel
Settatree) decides to help humanity by materialising among them. What
follows is a saga of down-to-earth disillusionment. Humanity, it seems,
prefers to stay in its rut of misery and abuse, sex, violence and
slaughter.
Bleak, yes, but in this staging by the National Student Theatre
Company, it emerges as a fierce, often funny, piece of physical theatre
where the plentiful dance is deftly integrated into the occasional text.
Simon Glass, who devised and choreographed the show, uses everything
from tango to Ballanchine for the moves that graphically encompass
domestic breakdown, aggressive sex, queer bashing and child abuse --
this last is delicately, chillingly set to the strains of Girl You'll Be
A Woman Soon.

ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester Building Society is offering up to #6000 cashback
to borrowers taking out standard rate mortgages. So long as the
loan-to-value ratio does not exceed 90% they will receive 4% of the loan
as a cashback, up to #6000. Alternatively, discounts of up to 1.95% off
the variable rate for three years can be taken.
Corporate bond
from Hambros
Hambros unit trust managers is launching its High Provider Trust which
will be a PEPable corporate bond and gilt investment designed for the
more cautious investor. It will yield 7.5% after charges, with quarterly
payments. Charges will be 3.25% initial and 1% annual, taken from
income. Minimum investment is #1000.
Preference PEP
from Thornton
THORNTON Unit Managers is making available a PEP investing in its
Preference Trust which yields 8.8% after charges. The trust has been in
the top three performers in its sector over one, two, three four and
five years. Over the past three, four and five years it has also
outstripped inflation in capital terms with income withdrawn. Minimum
investment is #3000 and charges are 3% initial and 1.25% annual, taken
from income, which is paid half-yearly.
The portfolio is divided half and half between large company and
smaller company Preference shares. Fund manager Julian Hepher says that
Preference shares are not high risk and their capital performance is
linked to that of gilts rather than equities. He considers they are less
volatile than convertibles which offer similar yields.
Discount deal
on re-mortgages
SKIPTON Building Society has launched a new re-mortgage deal,
involving a 1.5% interest rate discount for a year plus free legal fees,
valuation and mortgage indemnity guarantee and a cashback of up to
#1000. For those borrowing additional funds on top of the re-mortgage,
the addition will be interest free for two years.

WHILE all of the sums that have been talked about are over estimates
-- Freddie McLeod told me that the players will only be paid what the
SRU can afford and that will be appreciably less than the #35,000-a-man
mentioned, bear in mind that the SRU have a forecast deficit --
Scotland's clubs have nevertheless taken up the gauntlet of entering the
professional ranks and followed the national lead.
I think that it now will hasten the arrival of a club-versus-country
battle over the services of players that has only been seen in football.
Stirling County, I understand, are setting up trust funds for their
players, the Melrose players are paid for doing appearances for their
sponsor, and have one as well, but perhaps a better bit of knowledge is
that Heriots' have already set up a fund for their players.
''We think that they should benefit from all aspects of the game,''
said Fraser Dall, former stand-off with the club who is heading the
Heriot's rugby effort, and whose son, Graham, was voted The Herald's
most promising young player.
''We decided to get the ball rolling, and we have set up the trustees
and have done everything possible within SRU guidelines. At the end of
this season, the players are going to South Africa on tour, free for
them, and after the tour, there will be money to pay out.''
It is a radical step. Everyone knows that most of the rugby clubs in
Scotland have broken the rules as far as paying for flights, coaches,
and giving some players excessive expenses, but now that's not an issue
any more, and you can hear the sigh of relief as they set themselves up
to carry their tasks out professionally. Out go the slush funds that
have brought players and coaches to certain clubs.
''We are a big club,'' says Dall. And they are, as their poaching
effort this summer showed, with Andy Irvine heavily involved as a
dangled carrot. ''And as a major club we have to be seen to be up front
and abide by the rules. We have to make sure that when the players
receive the cash it is legal, the tax has been paid, and there are no
slip-ups.
''The players are getting free boots, free this, and free that. They
will be paid for appearances for sponsors, and I think they realise that
it is a partnership between them and us.''
As to the money involved, Dall says that initially there will be few
fortunes made on the main pitch at Goldenacre. ''There is money to be
made now for clubs within a more competitive league structure, and with
the advent of a serious cup competition,'' he says.
Having spoken to some of the senior clubs, you can see that they are
all bamboozled at what exactly all of this talk of professionalism means
to them, but you sense that they know they have to follow suit, and pay
their players, if they are to keep them.
It is just accepted now that rugby is to be professional.
I think that it is an enormous step. But what could frustrate the
clubs this season is the fact that they don't know what the content of
their own players' contracts with the SRU will be.
It's known that Freddie McLeod has a meeting with the top players on
Monday night to do some testing, but when the contracts are signed,
could it be the case that on the one hand, the players are told to look
after themselves and pick their games, and on the other, told to play
all of the district games and some other high-level games?
Where will that leave club games? It was Jim Jarvie, on the committee
of Premier League clubs which is pushing for more influence with the
SRU, who told me that: ''We didn't know anything about Freddie's
announcement about professionalism, and we knew nothing about the change
of sponsor.
''The game is running out of control. We want to be listened to. How
will paying players at international level affect their commitment with
us?''
Even while the SRU was the most squeaky clean union in the world,
Scottish clubs were breaking the rules. Now that the rules they used to
break are being expunged, they know that the only way to stay one jump
ahead of the SRU is to pay their players. They will, they are, and it
will soon be rife. I just hope their are some big cheque books around
for the ambitious.

MARK FISHER was surprised about what he learned during a train journey
with authors to the Book Festival
THURSDAY, midnight: What comes up must go down. And if you want to
hang out with a train-load of authors leaving London for the Edinburgh
Book Festival, well, you've just got to get the Sleeper down to meet
them -- Fringe shows to see or not.
Friday, 7am: Why are they giving me coffee? What am I doing on a
train? How am I 400 miles from home? And why didn't I go to bed when I
said I would?
9am: Finishing a King's Cross breakfast, I hear that the people from
Walker Books have lost Wally in a crowd of commuters. Now anyone who's
ever seen one of the hugely popular Where's Wally children's picture
books will know that Wally's usual raison d'etre is to be lost in a
crowd of commuters. But this is a flesh-and-blood Wally, in red-striped
togs, who's supposed to be bringing his team of red-striped chums to
Scotland with him. Fortunately he is found again, providing the camera
crew with many a photo opportunity.
11am: After an hour of hesitation -- as we try to figure out what's
supposed to happen when a bunch of journalists, a gang of publishers,
and a smattering of authors are given two first-class carriages by
InterCity East Coast -- we finally drop our pretence at cool and start
to mingle.
I settle across a table from Marsha Hunt, looking as stunning as ever,
who gets talking about the importance of artists creating an imaginative
life for the people they know about. Her concern is with finding a voice
for black Britain, one distinct from the black American voice, which is
why she's set up the SAGA literary prize for new black writers. She's
coming to Edinburgh to launch the award on Sunday.
Then in the new year she's lining up a tour of her 1994 Fringe show,
Joy, the play that gave her the idea for setting up the award in the
first place.
11.30am: I'm sure we were here to talk books, but folk keep sounding
off about theatre. David Wood, actor, playwright, magician, presenter,
you name it, joins me to expound on the low status given to children's
theatre, the decreasing levels in state funding, and the art of putting
on a decent Christmas show.
He also covers his career from starring alongside Malcolm McDowell in
Lindsay Anderson's If, writing hit children's shows such as The
Gingerbread Man and BFG, to his current attempts at bringing Noddy to
the stage. More importantly -- what would a junket be without freebies?
-- he slips me a copy of The Magic Show, a stunningly designed book of
tricks he's created with Richard Fowler to introduce children from the
age of three to the conjurer's craft.
Noon: And lo, I am summoned to the feet of four wise women from
Virago.
Crouching in the corridor between tables, I have an audience with
Joanna Goldsworthy, Mira Hamermesh, Sophie Parkin, and Margaret Busby
all contributors to Mothers by Daughters, an anthology of essays in
which women face up to their relationships with their mums. The act of
writing, they all agree, was cathartic, made them break out of
repetitive patterns of behaviour, take responsibility for their part in
the relationship, and, in some cases, to cement new friendships with
their mothers.
It's also made a huge impact on readers since it was first published
on Mothering Sunday this year, as countless letters and unsolicited
contributions attest. Someone else is already working on a book about
boys and their mums.
2pm: ''Ladies and Gentlemen, the train is now approaching Edinburgh
Waverley.''
Passengers leaving the train are requested to bring with them all
personal belongings, free books, bottles of whisky, stray authors, and
used press releases. Please leave the Festival as you found it.

DISAPPOINTING revenue figures from Eurotunnel are likely to increase
calls for a restructuring of its finances to reduce crippling interest
charges on its #8000m debt.
In the first half of the year revenue came to #104.5m, with the second
quarter figure at #60.3m against the #70m looked for by analysts.
Comparisons with last year are not possible given that limited
commercial operations only began in the opening quarter.
However, the full operational potential of the tunnel is only now
being achieved. There are four car Shuttle departures an hour, the coach
service is under way and the Eurostar train fleet is complete. The
tunnel appears to have increased the size of the cross-channel market,
with passenger growth growing by 22% in the first half.
Last month, 112,000 cars were carried by the Shuttle, an 11.5%
increase on June, and a record 4965 cars were carried on July 29. The
freight shuttle also reached a record that day and July lorry traffic
rose 14% on June.
On present figures, the shuttle is heading for about a million cars
for 1995, well down on the rights issue forecast of May 1994, which
projected a market share of 40% by 1996.
Much will depend on the third quarter result which must show a good
gain in market share to keep Eurotunnel's bankers happy. A financial
restructuring, possibly involving the issue of shares for bank debt, in
order to reduce financing costs is viewed as inevitable by many
analysts.

CLYDESDALE Bank has pulled off a major coup, enticing corporate
finance guru John Berry from Bank of Scotland.
Mr Berry, director of corporate banking (west) at Bank of Scotland's
chief Glasgow office, is moving to head up and possibly expand
Clydesdale's corporate banking function.
Stewart Henderson, head of branch operations at Bank of Scotland's St
Vincent Street office, last night confirmed that Mr Berry had tendered
his resignation.
He added that the post would be filled fairly rapidly, from within the
bank.
Mr Berry is an instinctive deal maker who, apart from a spell in a
highly paid ambassadorial role for Societe Generale in Edinburgh in the
eighties, has been with Bank of Scotland throughout his career.
He first arrived at the Glasgow head office at the age of 21 and was
then sent to London. After two years seconded to Shell's treasury
department working on oil field developments such as North Cormorant, he
moved back to the bank working on export finance.
Coming north again, first to Glasgow, he went on to spend time in
Edinburgh setting up the HOBS computerised home and office banking
system. He then left to work for the French, lured, he once said, by the
offer of double his then salary.
But he returned to Bank of Scotland to join the new structured finance
team being created at Uberior House in Edinburgh. In April 1990 he
arrived in Glasgow.
Mr Berry quickly plugged into the small network, perhaps only 20
strong, of accountants, venture capitalists and lawyers in Glasgow, who
make most big deals struck around the city happen.
Since 1990, the deals his BoS team have partcipated in have been
flowing at a rate of more than one a month. Many were management
buy-outs, where Bank of Scotland has captured a UK lead. His biggest was
the #80m buy-out of the Newcastle-based Calder Group from Cookson.
Average deal size was around #3m.
Another feature of his nine-strong team was their enthusiasm for
capturing corporate accounts from rival banks. One success was the
in-transition Scottish Milk Marketing Board, which had fallen out with
the Royal Bank over the fate of the Galloway Creamery.
His team also acted for McLelland, the preferred bidder for the failed
business.
Bank of Scotland will not be best pleased that he is now taking his
hunger for deal making along the road to the Clydesdale.
Mr Henderson said: ''We are always disappointed to lose staff.''
However, he went on to say that he considered it, in some regards, a
back-handed compliment that other banks had to come to Bank of Scotland
for corporate finance staff.
He added that no-one was irreplaceable.

ON a hill overlooking Cobh harbour stands the town itself, from which
the residents watched as the immigrant coffin ships sailed away.
Nine million people, there were in Ireland 150 years ago this year,
when the potato famine struck. When its dark blight had passed there
were fewer than four million, and the little town near Cork is now a
memorial, both to those who died and to those who left never to return.
Perhaps that's why they make such a fuss of those who do come back --
though few will do so to greater acclaim than Sonia O'Sullivan. The
European 3000 metres champion in Helsinki, she bids to win the inaugural
women's 5000m title today at the world championships in Gothenburg.
Even Eire's international midfield footballer Roy Keane, a Cobh
native, rates less rapturous welcomes on his visits.
O'Sullivan departed for college in the USA, virtually unknown, and
with poor omens. She must be the first to have arrived at Villanova
University on a track scholarship with a leg in plaster, from a stress
fracture.
But when she returned to her native turf last year, following her
Helsinki win, some 40,000 people turned out -- more than eight times the
population of Cobh itself.
On an earlier success, world 1500m silver in Stuttgart, Bishop John
McGee of Cloyne, secretary to the late Pope John Paul I, presented her
with a specially minted Papal athletics medal, brought from Rome.
O'Sullivan said: ''Oh, I've a jugful of medals in the house.'' It
would be unsafe to bet that this unassuming, unspoiled woman has not
dumped the Papal medal among them.
They used to bring her home in an open bus, but the crowds got out of
hand. After last year's European 3000m victory -- the first athletics
gold by an Irish woman -- it was deemed to be too dangerous, and she was
taken home in a special train.
There were no fancy facilities to launch her on her way. Ballymore
Cobh, the club she helped found as a teenager, met in the porch of the
village's Vocational School. The only concession since O'Sullivan's rise
is that they now have a small clubhouse in the playground.
Nor were there early hints that she was destined to become a world
record holder (at 2000m, just ahead of Yvonne Murray, in Edinburgh last
year), or that she would take world silver at 1500m, despite having been
eclipsed, fourth, just a few days earlier in the 3000m by the Chinese
two years ago.
Her first race, aged seven, was a community one with a lollipop for
every entrant. ''I was not the winner,'' she recalls.
Even as an intermediate and junior she was beaten 23 times in 25 races
by Anita Philpot. But then she achieved a unique treble, by winning the
Irish schools, national junior, and national senior cross-country titles
in 1987, to attract US attention.
An account and marketing graduate, she has a winter coaching post at
Villanova, but still returns home from time to time. Often it is to
present prizes to children at the juvenile Carmelite college, in east
Cork, where, as all over the Republic, her face beams down from
hoardings advertising Heinz soup.
O'Sullivan might have tried for the 1500/5000 double here, and will in
Atlanta.
''I have never won a world title, and thought if I concentrated on one
event, I would be more focused and would give myself a better chance to
win,'' she says.
''It will be different at the Olympics, where my main event, the
5000m, is first, and I can do both.''
The world cross-country title also is in her sights next year. ''It
has been ever since I finished seventh in Boston. It's something I want
to win sooner or later. South Africa next year is a very good
opportunity -- warm, flat, and fast -- just how I like it.
''I don't like the mud -- when I raced at Durham (on this year's world
course) there was too much mud, and I was psyched out before I got
there.'' A marathon also features: ''Though not till I'm finished with
track.'' Despite the hopes of Britain's Paula Radcliffe, only one person
seems capable of preventing a hooly tonight.
Fernando Ribiero, the 10,000m winner, issued a warning to her Irish
rival: ''I didn't come all the way here to run for fun. I've come to win
a second gold.'' However, O'Sullivan dismisses Ribiero's world 5000m
record: ''It's the most accessible track mark,'' she says, and believes
she can beat it.
And then Cobh can prepare for another invasion.

THIS world is in turmoil. Old hatreds recur. Gulfs widen. Paranoia and
acquisitiveness increase. Governments are powerless. And so decent folk,
gently marshalled by Arnold Brown with his trademark heroic hesitancy,
gather in mutual perplexity to worry about the big issues at stake.
Trends in male facial-fuzz adornment, for instance. Arnold observes
and ponders, comparing Che Guevara's beard with that of Richard Branson:
revolutionary versus shop-counter revolutionary.
Whigfield; Gazza; Naomi Campbell; Frank Bruno; Cilla Black -- Arnold
invites us to consider what they're for. The National Lottery and the
National Front: are they linked? Scratching scratch-cards for a living:

illogical and glorious territory of Lockworld, fried eggs talk; kung fu

and Edith Piaf is forced to admit that, well, OK, maybe she does regret
not having sung more songs in Welsh.
Catch Sean's drift? Er, not entirely, but wherever it's headed, it's
very, very funny. Purchase tickets now for his surreal spivvery; the

Look forward to being creased by his conclusions about Einstein and

* I retired recently with two small pensions, and as part of my modest
portfolio of #16,000 I was advised to invest #3000 in an Axa Equity and
Law Investment Bond, which offers a death benefit of #3000 (this is
reduced by any withdrawals or part surrenders).
I realise now that a death benefit is not appropriate to my
circumstances. I have recently received a report from Axa Equity and Law
which states that the bid price value of the bond is #3193.32. I have
held the bond for two-and-a-half years without receiving any income and,
since income as well as capital growth is important to me, I wonder if
this was a wise investment. What do you think?
* In the two-and-a-half years to the end of June the FTSE-100 share
index, which measures the stock market performance of Britain's top
companies, rose in value by 16%. On top of that the companies would have
paid dividends.
Considering that you have taken no income from your bond, your return
of under #200 does seem to be exceptionally poor. This is not a form of
investment that we favour. In any event, #3000 out of #16,000 seems a
high proportion to invest in a single instrument.
Since you have not provided us with details of your other investments,
it is difficult for us to advise you on where you should reinvest the
proceeds from your bond. But in general for the small investor capital
growth can be provided by investment trusts and income by building
society deposits or gilts.* I used to have a cat but have not had one
now for a number of years. However, a friend of mine has several kittens
to find homes for and I have adopted one and, of course, am already very
fond of her. I have seen publicity for health plans for pets and they
seem a good idea, but I can't quite make up my mind. It seems relatively
cheap when I remember vet bills I have had in the past, but I'm not
convinced and would like a professional's view on them.
* As with all insurances, it is vitally important to study the small
print in detail and make inquiries if there is anything in them you do
not fully understand before handing your premium over. These policies
usually have quite a large excess. In other words, they will only pay
once the cost of treatment exceeds a certain level. This invariably
means that all routine visits to the vet for minor problems are
excluded, and over the lifetime of most pets this accounts for the
majority of expenditure on their health.
The policies, like human healthcare plans, should really be considered
as insurance against major health problems requiring surgery, which
rarely occur before the animal is elderly. They often have a top limit
on the amount they will pay per problem, so their help in dealing with
chronic conditions is soon exhausted.
As you say, the premiums are not onerous and having the cover may give
you peace of mind. The alternative is to put what you would have paid in
insurance premiums into a savings account, so that by the time your cat
reaches an age where health problems are more likely you will have a
small nest egg to pay for treatment. Incidentally, the same principle
also applies to other insurances -- for example, household appliance
breakdown insurance, which is not usually worthwhile -- and even
healthcare if you start young enough.
* We are two widowed sisters in our sixties. We recently sold our
family homes and combined our resources to buy a luxury flat for us to
share. As a result we each have money to invest. We already have
building society deposits to supplement our public service and state
retirement pensions. In addition, we each have a small portfolio of
shares.
As our running costs will be lower in the flat we do not need much
income from the money left over from the property transactions. We would
both like to invest this in shares which will eventually be passed on to
our families. My sister has about #50,000 available and I have #65,000.
Would these sums be sufficient to interest a stockbroker in giving us
investment advice, and what kind of returns can we expect from a
portfolio of shares?
* Stockbrokers in Scotland mainly serve private clients who provide
the bread and butter of their business. In the City of London most
brokers serve the large financial institutions and tend to impose high
minimum investment limits for private clients. You should, therefore,
encounter no problems, other than those of choice, in finding yourselves
a suitable stockbroker. A list can be obtained from the Stock Exchange
in Glasgow if you do not have a recommendation from a friend or adviser.
You may want your broker to recommend a portfolio of shares to you and
then execute the business for you. Subsequently he or she might advise
you of changes that you could make in your portfolio. As an alternative,
you could choose a discretionary service where the portfolio would be
managed for you and you would be informed of changes after they had been
carried out. There would be an extra charge for such a service. The
choice is yours, depending on your preference. Many private investors
take an active interest in their shares, in some cases turning it into a
pastime.
There is no single answer to your second question since yields vary
widely among equities. Currently the average dividend return is about
3.9% gross, but, among major companies, Hanson yields 7%, British
Telecom 5.7%, Sainsbury 3.2%, and Reuters 1.9%.
Investment trusts, which are ideal vehicles for small investors, tend
to sport below average yields, partly because of their overseas
investments and partly because of the emphasis they put on capital
growth. However, there are some investment trusts specialising in income
which offer above average yields.
It is best if you can give the stockbroker some idea of the income you
would like and whether you want the emphasis to be on income or growth,
or, perhaps, a combination of the two as many retired people prefer.
Both you and your sister should also provide the broker with details of
your current investments, as he or she will need to know about these
before recommending suitable new investments and, perhaps, suggesting
changes to your existing holdings.
* I inherited all of my brother's estate which, apart from some small
items, consisted of his house which I have now sold. After all expenses
of sale were paid, I received a cheque in settlement for just over
#55,000. I presume that this has to be included in my tax return, and I
would be obliged if you could say how the tax due will be calculated and
what information I will have to provide.
* The answer depends on whether the administration of your brother's
estate was finalised at the time the house was sold. If you sold the
house as executor of the estate then it is a disposal by the executry,
and any gain arising from the date of your brother's death to the date
of sale is likely to be small and liable to tax at the 25% rate. In
addition, the executry has a full annual capital gains exemption which
will be available to set against the gain, assuming the disposal was
made within three years of your brother's death. A disposal made during
the executry period does not affect your personal capital gains
position, and a separate tax return should be made for the executry.
If, however, the administration of the estate was complete and the
house transferred to you before the sale, then any gain arising will be
assessed on you personally and charged at your appropriate rate of tax.
Your own annual exemption would, of course, be available to the extent
that it remains unused and the gain should be reported on your own tax
return.
The calculation of the gain is the same in both cases. The value of
the property at the date of your brother's death is the base value, and
this as increased by inflation to the date of sale and the combined
figure then deducted from the sale proceeds net of expenses.
* We live modestly on a fairly low income and, therefore, qualify for
benefits such as rent rebate. We have been able to save amounts over the
years but one of the problems this brings is exceeding the level of
savings allowable to continue to qualify for benefit. The total of
savings is likely to go above the #6000 limit over the next year. Is
there anything you can suggest to avoid this situation, short of
spending the lot on a holiday or not reporting the extra savings?
* The benefits will as you say be affected by the level of your
capital and the amount of your income is also taken into account in
calculating benefits. You do not provide details of your income and,
therefore, giving advice is difficult, but one solution may be to spend
the capital on a purchased life annuity from an insurance company.
Payments from these annuities can be made to you monthly and they
comprise two elements, capital and income, and although the income
amount will have basic rate tax deducted at source, you can reclaim this
from the Revenue if you are eligible. The capital payments are, by
definition, not income and so do not count as such in the calculation of
the benefits to which you are entitled.
* I recently renewed my BUPA subscription and struggling through the
exclusions attaching to the policy was astonished to read that they
reserve the right to refuse to pay for intensive care where it is not
part of a standard medical procedure.
This suggests that should a complication arise in a routine operation
which requires transfer to intensive care the patient could find him or
herself saddled with the bill which could be thousands of pounds. This
doesn't seem right, particularly given the size of the premiums I pay.
Can you investigate please?
* This clause is to cover BUPA against having to pay for intensive
care when a policyholder arrives at a hospital as an emergency following
an accident or sudden illness. The healthcare policy is designed to pay
for planned treatment not emergencies, and there have been suspicions
that hospitals have been trying to charge those covered by healthcare
insurance for sudden emergencies.
A spokesman for BUPA said there would be no question of it not paying
for intensive care should this become necessary as a result of a
complication in a pre-planned operation which was covered by the policy.
The policyholder would definitely not have to pay in such circumstances.
The last paragraph of section 8.19 in the exclusions goes into this.
However, BUPA has always reserved the right to review cases where
intensive care exceeds three days. It would then talk to the hospital to
ensure that continued presence in intensive care was medically
appropriate.
Whatever happens in practice, the wording of exclusion 8.19 is clear
that BUPA has no obligation to pay for unexpected intensive care,
meaning that a customer cannot be 100% certain of being covered, which
is not very satisfactory.
* I read with interest your article on building society mergers and in
particular the payments which Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester savers will
receive once it is taken over by Lloyds Bank. Your article indicated
that the C&amp;G savers would receive a flat payment of #500 plus a
percentage of at least 13.2% for qualifying savers. The article then
gave an example of a well-heeled investor with #100,000 in savings who
would receive #13,700.
Can you please explain to me why the Halifax Building Society will
offer free shares to its members following the merger with the Leeds but
with a cap on savings of #60,000. So savers with #100,000 will receive
the same value of shares as those with #60,000.
* Under the Building Societies Act savers with #100 or more in
building society share accounts and the like (as opposed to deposit
accounts) qualify for membership rights and, therefore, in the case of
the Halifax/Leeds merger entitlement to free shares.
The allocation of the shares, as in an offer for sale, is up to the
merged society and it has, of course, laid down that any excess over
#50,000 held in a qualifying account will not be taken into account in
the allocation. It was on this basis that the members of the societies
approved the merger. Usually small investors are treated more generously
than larger investors in offers for sale, and it is the same in the
Halifax free share handout.
It makes sense for it to favour small investors in view of the size of
their vote compared with the low number of people with large holdings.
Those who think this unfair are in a minority, and so they will just
have to grin and bear it. After all, it is money for nothing so to
complain too loudly would be churlish.

WRITTEN and directed by Mariela Stevenson and originally commissioned
to mark the centenary of women at Glasgow University and first performed
(without some of this version's steamier bed scenes) in the grandiose
setting of the University's Gothic-Victorian stair hall.
The piece has the specificity that such a commission implies.
Stevenson draws a sharp and ruthless picture of the more dubious and
sordid activities taking place behind the sheltered doors of Academe,
the territory of power, sexual politics and plagiarism.
It's a complex and densely packed piece: plot-lines and timescales
interweave creating numerous permutations on the central themes; live
music hauntingly physicalises them; threads of the narrative are
revealed with an almost teasing sense of suspense.

WHETHER upside down, turning somersaults, or jumping through hoops,
the seven Mapapa lads keep smiling. And when they're not part of the
rolling and tumbling, they smile and dance to the equally bright and
cheerful chugga-chugga beat of Africa's Benga music.
Costumes of zazzy black and yellow stripes add interesting optical
effects to skilful routines that go from the low down of limbo dancing
to the high jinks of a clever skipping number where backflips are just
one of the tricky variations. Best of all, however, are the fast and
intricate human pyramids that round off the show, with the Mapapas tying
themselves into high-speed knots on and around each others' bodies.

HOW unfortunate that a gig in a kirk should turn out to be a curate's
egg.
The ''Boys'' can sing beautifully -- I Believe has seldom sounded more
heartfelt; If I Had A Hammer more celebratory -- but the acoustics and
the sheer size of St Giles' militated against the rockier, almost
Chicago blues-like material, and it was only on these rare moments when
their voices blended into a kind of choral glissando that the wee hairs
on the back of the neck really rose.
Too often they resorted to vocal gymnastics of the ''gosh that's a
long note'' variety and although in the end they inspired a good-going
gospel party, it was a case of another time, another place . . .

AS from last night blokes everywhere will be screwing metal plates to
their boots, tearing off their shirts and practising time steps in front
of the bedroom mirror. They will ache to be like those lean, mean,
floor-bruising Aussies who take time steps to warp factor nine in Tap
Dogs.
Dein Perry and his team of five run glorious, resounding riot over a
set that unfolds -- like a pop-up book -- into a building site. Tired of
flat surfaces, they tippety-tap-SLAM on sloping girders, up ladders and
over the metal equivalent of those Ziegfeld steps.
It's so deliciously cheeky, laddish even, and yet it's underpinned
throughout by punctilious techniques, choregraphic invention and
engagingly individual performances. As sweat haloed the stripped-down
dancers, normally douce adults were whooping like hormonally challenged
teenies.

* IT was reported in the New York Times that Ernest Hemingway slapped
author Max Eastman's face with a book, then Eastman said he threw
Hemingway over a desk and stood him on his head in the corner of the
office. In literature boys will be boys.
Hemingway denied that he had been stood on his head. ''He didn't throw
anybody, he jumped at me like a woman -- clawing, you know, with open
hands.'' Hemingway offered to settle it by inviting Eastman to join him
in a locked room with all legal rights waived.
Eastman declined the invitation but no doubt regretted baiting
Hemingway ''to come out behind that false hair on your chest'' in an
essay. The pair met accidentally in an editor's office and Hemingway
bared his chest then comment-ed on Eastman's lack of growth when he
reciprocated.
The blow was struck when Eastman refused to read out any of the
poisonous passages he had written. The very essay collection containing
it was sitting on the desk and shortly became the weapon Hemingway
wielded, disproving that sticks and stones may break my bones, but words
will never hurt me!

DEFINITELY not for children, the publicity warns -- presumably because
of all the tiresome puns about Ken's deficiencies in the love-pump
department. Adults would be well advised to give it a miss too.
Despite decent credentials, writer and director Lucille O'Flanagan and
writer Stephen Dinsdale (author of Anorak of Fire and Clive Neon), this
is disappointing drivel, clumsily staged, and seriously underwritten.
The premise of bringing plastic dolls to life never amounts to more
than a few visual gags, while satirising supermodels, Hi! magazine, and
fitness fads outscores shooting fish in a barrel on the pointless scale.
The performances, particularly Andrew Louden (Ken) and Charlotte
Bicknell (Barb), are comically competent but don't compensate. A
nutcracker ballet without the nuts, a lamentably inferior Ab Fab, this
corny musical is for dedicated collectors of kitsch only.

TOP City solicitor Freshfields yesterday accepted the blame for the
astonishing gaffe in the production of proxy forms for ScottishPower
shareholders, who are being asked to ratify their company's hostile bid
for Manweb.
ScottishPower has now decided to issue new light-green proxy forms to
its 570,000 shareholders. The cost, believed to be about #250,000, will
be borne by Freshfields.
As the original white proxy forms began to drop through letter-boxes
earlier this week, it was discovered that they did not contain a
pre-printed name and address for the particular shareholder, or any
bar-coded information which would allow ScottishPower's registrar, the
Bank of Scotland, to trace them to a shareholding on the register.
Although legally competent, the forms would have created a nightmare
for Bank of Scotland, which would in some cases have had to decipher
signatures in tying forms back to shareholdings.
Dominic Leahy, marketing director of Freshfields, said yesterday: ''We
do accept responsibility for the error on the proxy forms.
''Although we are told the original forms are legally valid, they have
caused shareholders some potential difficulties and a new form is being
sent out to shareholders immediately at no cost to the company
(ScottishPower). We will bear the cost.''
ScottishPower, which will be paying the bulk of the #32m of expenses
associated with the Manweb bid to City advisers, is also sending
shareholders details of a free telephone helpline, which will deal with
any queries about the proxy forms.
An official said: ''Our main concern is that any confusion is
clarified for our shareholders.''
The proxy forms relate to ScottishPower's extraordinary meeting in
Glasgow on September 4, at which shareholders will be asked to approve
the #1000m bid for Manweb.
ScottishPower issued its formal offer document on Monday and Manweb's
defence document, which must be issued within 14 days of the offer, is
now expected at the end of next week.
With the Chester-based electricity distributor not having been faced
with anything new in the Glasgow-based utility's formal offer, its
defence document will already be virtually complete.
It is believed it will centre on the rebuttal of ScottishPower's
criticisms of Manweb's performance, particularly the contention that it
is a high-cost distributor.
However, the requirements of shareholders are not likely to go
unheeded. Some analysts have been predicting a package of special
dividends, Preference shares and a slice of Manweb's stake in the
National Grid, worth as much as 425p per share.
It is not known whether Manweb will go as far as Northern Electric did
in its defence of the Trafalgar House bid. It may adopt a ''singed'',
rather than a ''scorched earth'', defence.
While there are undoubtedly potential cost savings through elimination
of duplication after any takeover, Manweb is likely to hammer home its
view that ScottishPower could not run the Merseyside and North Wales
distribution network more efficiently.
Manweb, which continues to strip out costs, considers ScottishPower's
offer to be an ''opening gambit'' and is gearing up for a long fight.
ScottishPower has pointed out that Manweb is the third-highest-cost
distributor out of the 12 regional electricity companies south of the
Border and the two Scottish companies. The Glasgow-based utility has the
lowest distribution cost per customer.
Manweb's higher domestic tariff has also been highlighted by
ScottishPower.
The Chester-based company has already declared its intention to issue
a profits and dividend forecast for the year to end-March, although
these figures will not reflect the impact of the recent regulatory
review.

ON a wild autumn night, an old silver birch tree felt the wind remove
its few remaining leaves, scattering them into the nearby burn, then
settled down for the winter. The sheep that used the tree roots as
shelter, cooried into the ground as the cold winter winds tore at the
tree's now bare branches.
The banks of the little burn had extended during the years because of
erosion from, let's say, habitual grazing of the surrounding land right
to the edge of the watercourse, and perhaps the sudden spates that came
from the ''improved'' drainage necessary for the successful growth of
non-indigenous species of tree planted in large numbers over the
surrounding hills.
The burn had been widened and shallowed. The tree's roots had become
more and more exposed and one night a particularly violent wind pulled
hard at its trunk and branches. It lost its tenuous grip and slowly fell
across the burn.
This would be unremarkable in the great scheme of things and anyone
walking the burn the following spring might only remark that winter had
taken its toll. But not people like William Midwood, managing director
of the River Beauly Fishings Company Ltd, because he sees exactly this
scenario as the crux of his management problems.
He is adamant that the best thing anyone interested in the husbandry
of one of our most magnificent natural assets, the Atlantic salmon, must
do, is to look after the habitat of the wee ones. It is no good lobbing
500 hatchery-reared parr into a pool capable of supporting only 14 fish
and it makes even less sense to deposit one parr into a pool that will
dry up in the height of summer. And so we come back to our silver birch.
It falls across the stream and the resulting tangle has finally
reduced one small part of the upper spawning reaches of a salmon river
to an area that will not now support more than a parr or two. And
Midwood's task, on behalf of future Beauly anglers, is to regenerate
that small part of the Beauly headwaters into a nursery capable of
supporting meangingful numbers of parr that have the requisite feeding
and cover to mature into smolts that make their way to the sea, to feed,
and return as mature salmon.
So, the dead tree is removed, the banks are fenced against sheep,
perhaps willows might be planted to trap silt, consolidate banks and
give feeding to the stream at leaf-fall in the autumn.
Scottish summers can be dry . . . witness this year, so any reservoir
of water at the head of a system should be used to keep the burns from
drying out. Perhaps some kind of sluice or dam might be created or
reinstated, allowing a regular release of water from a loch when river
levels are low.
The Beauly is a fascinating example of how the passion of one man,
William Midwood, allied with the experience and knowlege of those who
have fished the river for four generations, the Mathieson family who
have gillied there since the 1890s, can come together and work for the
good of the river.
On a recent summer visit, I saw hundreds of grilse running to the
headwaters far to the west, and am confident that the work done by
Midwood and his fellow enthusiasts will continue to improve this already
prolific fishery. The weather was Mediterranean and fishing was best in
the early morning or late evening. Standing waist-deep towards the tail
of a pool overlooked by Beaufort Castle, the fish were running in
shoals. The groundwork done during the past five years seems to have
been fruitful. Wading deep and casting square, my fly covered fish every
cast . . . both salmon and sea trout. A sea trout about a pound and a
half came to the net as darkness fell and later, in the mirk, I took a
neat five-pound grilse.
Many people involved in the salmon rivers of Scotland have thought
that all our problems lay at sea. Certainly we are less able to control
what happens in the wide expanses of salt water where our salmon feed.
But if we look after what might seem to some trivial bits of water, the
nurseries, there is no doubt that we will give the salmon and sea trout
a decent chance not just of survival, but of proliferation.

THEY'RE out there: bankers, lawyers, businessmen, dustmen,
secretaries, teachers. This writer is one of them; so was the late
Labour leader John Smith.
Munro baggers -- that single-minded breed of people whose aim is to
reach the summit of all the 3000ft high mountains in Scotland classified
as Munros.
There are currently 277 such mountains listed in Munro's Tables, the
bible of those who aspire to complete the set. I say ''currently''
because the number has changed over time. In the original tables,
published in 1891, there were 283. More accurate measurements of height
and a rethinking of what constitutes a ''separate'' 3000ft mountain have
brought about the changes.
Much has been written about Munros, but no-one up to now has tackled
the subject of Munro-bagging from the oblique perspective of trying to
analyse why people do it, in the process drawing together the historical
threads and examining the debates raised by the activity such as safety
and access.
Andrew Dempster, a maths teacher at Kilgraston School for girls at
Bridge of Earn in Perthshire, has filled in the gap with The Munro
Phenomenon -- a well-researched book that deals with the background to
the way this rather unique ''sport'', if it can be called such,
developed, the compulsions and philosophies that lie behind it, and what
people do afterwards.
Dempster completed his own round of the Munros in 1988 with Ben More
on Mull, having started some 10 years earlier on Ben Lomond. Asked about
his motivation for writing the book he said: ''Obviously the fact that I
had done the Munros helped. I felt that something like this had never
been done, and I wanted to pull all the different facts together. It's
more a book about people than it is about the Munros.''
Munro-bagging begins with a Victorian Tory landowner -- Sir Hugh
Munro. Dressed in Inverness cape and Balmoral bonnet, for there were no
lightweight fleece clothing or Gore-Tex waterproofs then, Munro spent a
good deal of his adult life classifying Scotland's 3000ft mountains,
measuring their height and noting topographical details.
The book opens, logically, with a chapter on Munro, who died aged 63
in 1919, ironically not having got to the top of all the mountains he
listed. That honour fell to the Rev Archibald E Robertson, subject of
the book's second chapter and, like Munro, someone who came from a
privileged, upper-class background which gave him the free time required
for mountaineering.
Robertson's last Munro, Meall Dearg, on the switchback Aonach Eagach
ridge above Glencoe, was reached on September 28, 1901, making it a
historic date in the chronology of Munro-bagging.
It had taken him just more than 10 years to climb the 283 Munros on
the original list; a remarkable feat for the period. Even with the
accessibility available nowadays, with good roads and transport, the
average time for completion of the 277 mountains now listed is still 10
years.
Writer and lecturer Hamish Brown focused attention on the Munros when
he did the first continuous round of them in 1974. His book about the
trip, Hamish's Mountain Walk, a Paladin paperback, is regarded as
something of a classic. Dempster consulted Brown over The Munro
Phenomenon, and readily admits: ''It definitely blossomed when I spoke
to him. It would have been a much poorer book without his input.''
But what of the ordinary, everyday Munroist, snatching a day here, a
weekend there, and the odd longer holiday to complete his round?
They each have tales to tell, for climbing the Munros provides
adventure, companionship, excitement, sometimes danger, and a liberal
dose of pure, unadulterated enjoyment. In a chapter entitled ''One Man's
Munros'', Dempster records his own story, and anyone who shares in this
esoteric pastime will identify readily with his experiences.
Like the Hogmanay party at Camusunary bothy in Skye. ''Five of us
spent a memorable three nights there to see in New Year 1986,'' records
Dempster.
''Although everything had been carried in, no expense was spared --
and coal for the fire was the most awkward and bulky item to carry.
Driftwood was plentiful, so we had a blazing fire each night: quite the
most important thing in a bothy at this time of year.
''With darkness falling by 5pm it is a long night, but with good
company, a roaring fire and plenty to eat and drink, the time inevitably
flies. A canny ploy is to stretch out the dinner courses, or rather the
time between them, so that the pleasurable act of eating (and drinking!)
becomes the focus of the whole evening.''
0 It is this chapter which epitomises what Munro-bagging, and going
into the hills in general, is really all about. It encapsulates much
more than the mechanical act of climbing hills, and it is this that
others, who do not share the outdoor passion, can find difficult to
understand.
I love the free breath of the broad-wing'd breeze,
I love the free bird poised at lofty ease,
And the free torrents far up-sounding hymn;
I love to leave my littleness behind
In the low vale where little cares are great,
And in the mighty map of things to find
A sober measure of my scanty state,
Taught by the vastness of God's pictured plan
In the big world, how small a thing is man!
John Stuart Blackie
Surprisingly perhaps, those who have completed rounds are still
relatively few in number -- well under 1500. As to my own aspirations to
join them, well, I have around 30 left to do, and one of these days I'll
get round to finishing them. For the time being, I'm keeping the
champagne on ice.
* The Munro Phenomenon by Andrew Dempster is published by Mainstream,
#14.99 (hardback).
* On Mountains, a discussion with a panel of writers and climbers,
will be held on August 21 at 5pm in the Coutts Studio Theatre at the
Book Festival to mark the 25th year of the Mountaineering Council of
Scotland.

I HAVE never met any foreign visitor who did not declare, with shining
sincerity, that they absolutely loved Edinburgh.
The Athens of the North seems somehow to generate all kinds of
positive feelings. Even the weather, which Scots always seem to feel
that they have to apologise for, is not seen as a serious deterrent to
enjoyment of the global experience.
Hollywood fantasies, like Rob Roy and Highlander -- far from
diminishing the image of the legendary land of men in skirts, wailing
music, and haunted castles -- seem only to have enhanced the glamour and
mystique. None of the romance seems to be rubbed off by contact with
reality -- a modern and bustling capital, with its quota of noise,
traffic, parking problems, graffiti sprayers, litter louts, and all the
other ills that cities of the Western world are heir to.
The good folk of Edinburgh -- generally considered cold by the rest of
the country -- would probably be surprised to learn of the reputation
that they have for warmth and hospitality. Perhaps the reason for
Edinburgh's friendliness is that it is really quite a small city. In
actual fact, it's more like an overgrown village where people still have
the time to pass the time of day, and neighbours tend to know one
another. In no part of the town do you ever really lose complete contact
with nature.
Tantalising glimpses of the green flanks of the Lammermuirs and the
Pentlands and the silvery Forth estuary pop up between buildings and at
intersections in the heart of the commercial centre. Hedgehogs and foxes
turn up in parks and herons fly in from Duddingston Loch bird sanctuary
to eat the goldfish in the ornamental ponds of the gardens in genteel
Morningside.
Edinburgh, with its pinnacled landscape of rocky ridges, stepped
gables, stone thistles, clock towers, church spires, and Grecian
columns, is first and foremost a city of inspiring views.
Famous views like the all-embracing vistas from the Castle, or from
the Nelson Monument in Calton Hill.
But there are other, unsung views which deserve better
acknowledgement. Does any other McDonald's restaurant in the world have
a grander view than the one in Princes Street, looking over to the
Castle? And I doubt there is another department store coffee shop in
Britain which can rival the vista from John Lewis's windows in the St
James Centre. Banks are not notably panoramic either, but the outlook
from the Bank of Scotland offices in the Mound is quite breathtaking!
Protected by a crag like a lion couchant, Edinburgh is built on seven
hills -- a characteristic it shares with Rome and Kampala. Much of its
unique charm and character depend on the fact that it has been spared
the cyclic transformations of other British cities. Planners have tended
to avoid the tricky job of demolishment and reconstruction, preferring
simply to move on down and start again, leaving the original medieval
nucleus which grew up clinging to the flanks of the Castle, with its
cobbled streets, its labyrinth of narrow ''closes'', and its old market
places.
In the eighteenth century, therefore, the magnificent Georgian New
Town was laid out on the other side of the loch at the foot of the
Castle rock, a loch which, subsequently drained, was to make the ideal
bed for the railway which the Victorians were to bring to the heart of
the city, with tracks and Waverley Station neatly concealed in a gully
surrounded by the splendid Princes Street Gardens.
There is, however, another Edinburgh which is largely unknown to the
people who live there -- a parallel world which they are barely aware of
as they go about their normal business.
Citizens might well be surprised to know that there are places where
smiling natives in kilts dish out ''wee drams'' and push giggling
Japanese tourists through the ''Gay Gordons''. And just how many of them
have sat down to dinner with a waxwork witch sitting at the next table
or gone hunting down the dark closes of the Royal Mile for the ghosts of
the body-snatchers Burke and Hare or the evil warlock Thomas Weir?
How many of them appreciate their National Gallery, considered one of
Europe's finest small collections, sporting Raphael, El Greco,
Rembrandt, Constable, Titian, Velasquez, Van Gogh, and Gauguin? And few
of them have ever bothered to go and admire the extraordinary oak
hammerbeam roof of the High Court's Great Hall.
Not many either get the chance to see the interior of one of these
splendid Georgian houses with the high windows, lofty ceilings, and
grand staircases, where you are given a key in order to get into the
garden in the square in front. Some of the greatest bed-and-breakfast
establishments and guest-houses are situated in buildings such as these,
complete with Laura Ashley curtains, silver Apostle teaspoons, and
splendid antique inlaid and lacquered furniture which the landlady's
great-uncle David, the missionary, brought back from China.
The ''Citadel of the Slope'' (this is considered to be the likeliest
Celtic derivation of the name) is hard to beat for intriguing sights.
There's the patch of blood on the floor of Queen Mary's room in Holyrood
Palace where her secretary Rizzio was murdered by her jealous husband,
the mighty candelabrum in stone called the Scott Monument, a clock
covered in flowers, St Giles' Cathedral (which is not really a
cathedral) where an old woman threw her stool at the preacher's head and
sparked off a religious war, the tiny white chapel of St Margaret --
Edinburgh's oldest building -- the Heart of Midlothian which people spit
upon, the street where Sean Connery was born, the place where the
witches were burnt, Adam Smith's resting place in Canongate graveyard
and the dogs' cemetery on Castle Rock, the penguins in the zoo and, of
course, the Tattoo on the Castle esplanade -- indisputably one of the
greatest shows on earth . . .
My own favourite ''sight'' is that old attraction, the Camera Obscura
in the Outlook Tower just under the Castle. To my mind, none of the
latest illusions of virtual reality can beat it as, like the sorcerer's
apprentice, you gaze down into the bowl of the great lens and observe
the intimate life of Princes Street, with all these little figures
scuttling along, unaware that a great eye from on high is following
them. You can almost reach out and pick up these little people in your
hand.
Shopping is any tourist's favourite pursuit and Edinburgh is
well-equipped to satisfy all demands. But the more discriminating will
not wish to linger long amidst the tartan tammies of the Royal Mile, or
the sadly tarnished Princes Street -- once the queen of boulevards and
now progressively becoming more and more difficult to distinguish from
any other British High Street, with their identical chain stores.
Thank goodness there is still Jenners, which claims to be the world's
oldest privately owned department store, to keep the flag flying!
The classiest shops are in George Street, while probably the most
amusing shops are in Victoria Street and West Bow, off the Grassmarket,
with unique establishments like the MacDonald Nelson Trading Company
(Celtic jewellery and unusual Scottish souvenirs) and Robert Cresser,
better known as Victor the Brush (selling, believe it or not, brushes).
The candle shop is, appropriately, in Candlemaker Row, and Stockbridge,
along from Dean village, is the recommended place for antiques.
The Scotch Whisky Heritage Centre on the Royal Mile offers Disney-like
tours through the history of the national beverage and a well-stocked
shop, and there's a Scotch Malt Whisky Society in Giles Street for the
connoisseur. Tartan and kiltmakers' establishments abound, with James
Pringle Weavers, Bangor Road, Leith, probably the best-known.
One problem which visitors tend to complain about is the difficulty in
finding Scottish cuisine. In fact, in Scotland's capital, you can find
practically every kind of food -- like creditable curries, pasta al
dente, authentic steamed dumplings, stuffed vine leaves, snails,
nouvelle cuisine masterpieces and vegetarian fantasias -- but you'll be
hard pushed to find typical native specialities, unless you want to
settle for fish 'n' chips in the Waverley Centre or a pub-lunch pie.
Scots do not, alas, as foreigners tend to think, dine habitually at
home on salmon, pheasant, trout, freshwater prawns, and grouse -- all
home products of worldwide fame.
And contrary to tourist expectations, haggis is not so abundant. In
actual fact, the Scots themselves eat it rarely -- usually only once a
year when they are celebrating the anniversary of their national poet,
Robert Burns -- although they enjoy teasing foreigners with tales about
the ''wee hairy beastie with three legs for running round the side o'
the hill''.
Haggis can, however, be found regularly at Edinburgh's most
traditional and prestigious hotel, the Caledonian (affectionately known
locally as the ''Caleys''), at the West End of Princes Street, and any
self-respecting landlady will produce porridge upon request. She may
well be the best bet for other homely Scottish fares, such as mince 'n'
tatties, Scotch broth, finnan haddies, mashed turnips, and mealie
puddings!
Tea, however, is Scotland's true culinary glory. Clarinda's Tearoom
(called after one of Burn's many muses) on the Canongate is justly
renowned and the Caley teas are an institution. Other top hotels, like
the Balmoral on Princes Street, produce a princely spread of fresh baked
scones, finger sandwiches, and dainty cakes.
The best place to meet Edinburgh people (except at Festival time, when
they will be packed with other tourists) is in the pub. There are 700
pubs in Edinburgh, which is considered the best city for pubs in the
whole of Britain.
Most of them are old and quaint and full of history. Among the most
famous: Bobby's Bar, beside Greyfriars Churchyard, with Edinburgh's
best-loved monument in front -- to the little dog, Bobby, who guarded
his master's grave for 14 years and was finally adopted officially by
the city; Deacon Brodie's on the Royal Mile, named after the creepy
character who inspired R L Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; Ensign
Ewart, a favourite haunt of Edinburgh tour guides; and the Last Drop, a
macabre reference to the nearby site of the old gallows.
Edinburgh's newest area is the port of Leith -- a mere generation ago
considered a place of ill repute. The old buildings and warehouses have
been cleaned up and everyone has realised how attractive they actually
are. On your way down Leith Walk, don't miss paying a visit to Valvona
and Crolla's, Edinburgh's historic Italian grocer's, with wine tastings
in the back shop.
Leith is now the centre of a blossoming night-life and was the
picturesque venue of the recent 1995 Cutty Sark Tall Ships event, with
day-long street parties and fireworks -- all part of the Edinburgh
tradition for enjoying itself.
One way or the other, there is some sort of a festival or a special
event going on in Edinburgh almost every month of the year. The great
Edinburgh International Festival, with its exuberant, contemporary
Fringe, is preceded by the Jazz and Blues Festival, overlapped by the
Book Festival and the Film Festival, and followed up by the Storytelling
Festival. Then, throughout the year, there is the Science Festival, the
Children's Festival, the Puppet Festival, and the three-day New Year
revelries known as Hogmanay. Small wonder you sometimes hear old ladies
complain that ''You can't get on the buses for all the tourists!''
In between times, there is a period of respite, when the bagpipers
fold up their chanters and move out from Princes Street and the cold
east wind from the Firth of Forth blows all the litter away like snow.
This is when Edinburgh really comes into its own.
In the drizzling rain, the Castle seems suspended in space, shrouded
in a mantle of mist, and they say that those with ears to hear can make
out the sound of the ghostly feet of long-ago battalions echoing faintly
as they march round Castle Rock.

ANGLO/Dutch consumer products group Unilever cautioned yesterday
that growth in North America could ease in the second half and overall
growth for the year would be flat.
This follows a much more serious warning earlier in the week from
paper and packaging group Rexam, the former Bowater, which supplies
consumer industry customers, that it was suffering a shock turn for the
worse across the Atlantic as customers reduced stocks and demand fell,
confounding earlier expectations and resulting in a hammering for the
share price.
With Unilever, it is nothing like so dramatic, though the market was
surprised by the flat second half projection.
The company has enjoyed considerable advances in North America this
year after rebounding from the depressed detergent activities following
cost-cutting, while some of the Continental European countries have
proved more difficult, in part reflecting the hangover from the damaging
soap powder wars with arch rival Procter &amp; Gamble over Persil Power.
In announcing the second-quarter and half-year results, chairman Sir
Michael Perry said the overall development of the business, in constant
terms, will at least be similar to that achieved in the first half.
However, the geographic mix of the results may be different, with some
easing of the high growth seen in North America.
By coincidence, this caution comes only two months after the American
Family Association, a Christian lobbying group claiming a million
supporters, urged a US boycott of goods made by Unilever in protest at
what it called the company's sponsorship of prime time network
television programmes featuring sex, violence and profanity.
However, more pertinent in the expected slowdown is the restructuring
programme in detergents.
Unilever's first-quarter performance had disappointed, but the second
quarter is above expectations at #655m, up 10% at current exchange rates
to leave the six months figure ahead 8% at #1115m on the same basis. On
constant rates they were 5% up at #1110m.
The trading environment for Unilever's world-wide business remains
mixed. Overall demand for products outside Europe contrasted with
continuing softness in some of the Continental countries. In North
America, overall sales, and margins and profits, improved sharply over a
''modest'' first half in 1994.
Ice cream led the way in foods, other categories being held back by a
programme of reducing stock levels in the trade. Detergents recorded
volume growth and profits continued to benefit from the cost reduction
programme instituted last year.
In Continental Europe, after a disappointing start, there was some
improvement of underlying sales and margins of consumer operations. In
foods, profits improved in most categories. But oil and dairy based
foods profits fell as the total market declined. In detergents, the new
concentrated washing powder is in wide distribution and Unilever is in
the process of rebuilding market share after the previous debacle.
Outside the mature markets of Europe and North America, where Unilever
is making a strong attack on the emerging markets, as well established
ones, sales growth continued and profits rose, with notably strong
growth in India and South Africa.
Detergents and personal products businesses continue to do well, but
shortfalls in Brazil led to lower profits in food operations despite a
good performance in beverages and strong volume growth in ice cream.
Unilever's sober appraisal of the likely outlook for the rest of the
year inevitably dampened some analysts full-year projections, and the
shares dipped 21p to 1259p.

Paul Scott claims Scottish support for the Act of Union is a myth and
that it wasforced on Scotland using bribery and threats
NO event in the past 300 years of Scottish history has had a more
profound effect on the country than the Union of 1707, but there is deep
misunderstanding of what it was and how it happened. For over 100 years
Unionist propaganda has been trying hard to persuade us that it was an
arrangement which Scotland wanted, at the time, for the sake of access
to the English and colonial markets. Constant repetition has persuaded
many people to believe this, but it is the opposite of the truth. The
''incorporating'' Union was forced on Scotland to serve English
political and strategic purposes.
John Clerk of Penicuik was one of the members of the Scottish
Parliament who voted for the Union. Afterwards he wrote a book about it
in Latin of which a translation has just been published by the Scottish
History Society. He says that not even 1% of the Scottish people were in
favour of the Union, but it was English policy ''either to destroy us or
force us into union''. The Scots had to accept that ''you cannot force
your will on those stronger than yourself''.
In defiance of the historical evidence, Unionists still try to push
the same old line. Ian Lang wrote in a newspaper article a few months
ago: ''In 1707 Scotland sought and won full participation in the UK
Parliament.'' Distortion could hardly go further. In a recent debate in
Glasgow University, George Robertson made a slightly less extravagant
claim that ''the Union rests and has always rested on consent''.
The theory that the Scots agreed to the Union for reasons of trade has
also become part of accepted wisdom. It was evolved in the middle of the
nineteenth century by two historians, Macaulay and Burton, who wanted to
find an explanation for the Scottish sacrifice of their independence.
The modern English historian who has made an extensive study of the
matter, P W J Reilly, concluded that trade ''hardly entered'' into the
real motives. In fact, from the Scottish point of view, considerations
of trade weighed more heavily against the Union than for it.
Andrew Fletcher and the merchant interest argued that the treaty would
be harmful to Scottish trade, that imports from England would destroy
manufacturing industry in Scotland, and that duties designed for English
conditions would put impossible burdens on the Scottish economy. They
were right. All the evidence is that the Scottish economy was seriously
damaged by the Union. It took about 50 years to recover and then largely
because of Scottish initiatives in new technologies in manufacturing and
agriculture.
In any case, such considerations had very little influence. The terms
of the Union were dictated by the English Government, and Scottish
wishes and Scottish opinions were ignored. The treaty was ratified by
the Scottish Parliament after three months debate by a majority of 110
to 69, but the Parliament was not representative or subject to popular
election. Contemporary sources on both sides of the question agree that
the Union was massively unpopular.
Scotland at the start of the eighteenth century was weak and
vulnerable, largely as a result of the Union of the Crown in 1603. At
that time, and for the century which followed, the monarch had actual,
and not merely theoretical, power. This power was exercised through and
on the advice of English ministers and in the interests of England.
Scotland was still nominally independent but it had lost its
international identity, control of foreign and trade policy and even the
right to appoint the members of its own government. England's foreign
wars damaged Scottish trade. Although Scotland contributed men and
money, it was forgotten in the peace settlements and left virtually
defenceless at home.
The revolution of 1688-89 restored a degree of freedom to the Scottish
Parliament. It could debate and decide as it pleased, but its Acts were
still subject to royal assent and the officers of state (or, as we
should now say, ministers) who sat in it, directed its debates, and
administered the government, were appointed and instructed by London.
Not content with these powers, the English government exercised other
influences through patronage and bribery. The most remarkable coup was
the recruitment of the Duke of Hamilton. He acted as the leader of the
opposition in the Parliament of 1703 to 1707, and as such was cheered
whenever he appeared in the streets of Edinburgh. But he repeatedly
frustrated his own side, and there is convincing evidence that he was in
the pay of the English government. Bribery was not only pervasive, but
well targeted.
The disadvantages of this system of remote control were brought into
sharp focus by the failure of the Darien scheme in 1700. As King of
Scotland, William gave assent to the Scottish trading company. As King
of England, he did his best to undermine it. English shareholders
withdrew and English diplomatic pressure discouraged other European
investment. In a great burst of patriotic fervour, the entire capital
was subscribed in Scotland, amounting to about half of the money in
circulation and the entire assets of many people. The venture collapsed,
partly because it was ill-conceived and partly because of English
hostility. To add to the misery, several years of bad summers and poor
harvests caused actual starvation.
At the beginning of the eighteenth century there was general agreement
in Scotland that indirect control from London was intolerable. An
opportunity to escape from the joint monarchy, which was the source of
the problem, arose in 1700 when the last of Queen Anne's children died.
There was now no obvious or automatic successor to the throne. The
English Parliament, without any consultation with Scotland, passed an
Act of Succession in 1701, offering the throne to Sophia, Electress of
Hanover, and her descendants. Not for the last time they seem to have
forgotten about Scotland, which was now free to make its own decision
about the succession.
This was the situation which faced the Scottish Parliament summoned in
1703. The instructions from London to the Commissioner, Queensberry,
were to obtain acceptance of the Hanoverian succession and the supply of
money. This would have meant, of course, the preservation of indirect
control. The Scottish Parliament had other ideas. Following Fletcher's
analysis they passed the Act of Security, which provided either for the
choice of a separate successor or the transfer of all power from the
throne to Parliament.
The English Government did not react until the Scottish Parliament
showed its determination by passing the same Act again in 1704. England
was confronted with a threat to a vital national interest; the loss of
control over Scotland. Early in 1705 the English Parliament passed an
Act calling for negotiation of a union with Scotland and the application
of sanctions if Scotland did not accept the same succession by December
25.
The Scottish Parliament was perfectly ready to discuss union, which up
to that time had generally meant any form of alliance or association and
which did not imply the loss of a separate parliament. During the debate
on this, Hamilton performed what he afterwards called his ''signal
service'' to the Court. One evening, after most of his supporters had
left the House, he suddenly proposed that the appointment of the
Scottish Commissioners should be left to the Queen. The Government
seized this opportunity and it was so decided. This meant in effect that
both teams of negotiators were appointed by the Queen's English
ministers. Those on the Scottish side were the officers of state and
some of their friends and proteges, with only one exception, Lockhart of
Carnwath. Under these circumstances genuine negotiation was not to be
expected.
There is no need to speculate about the nature of the discussions in
London in the summer of 1706 because we have information from the
official minutes and from accounts in the letters or memoirs of some of
the participants. Even before the formal talks started, Mar, the
Secretary of State, wrote to Carstares in Edinburgh: ''They (the
English) think all the notions about federal unions and forms a mere
jest and chimera. I write this freely to you, though it is not fit this
should be known in Scotland, for fear of discouraging people, and making
them despair of the treaty. You see what we are to treat of is not in
our choice, and that we see the inconveniences of treating an
incorporating union only.''
These inconveniences were exactly what followed. The Scots made a
token effort to preserve their separate Parliament, but the English
would not hear of it and the Scots gave way at once. That was the
pattern throughout. At intervals of a few days, meetings were held at
which written proposals were accepted with very little discussion. The
Scottish officers of state were accustomed to acting on English
instructions, as their letters abundantly show. In this manner, the
business was conducted with speed and ease.
It was one thing to dictate terms in London; it was another to
persuade the Scottish Parliament to accept them. Much of the treaty
consists of measures clearly designed to appeal to the self-interest of
the classes represented in Parliament; the guarantees of the Scottish
legal system, the heritable jurisdictions, and the rights and privileges
of the royal burghs. These particular clauses were proposed by the
Scots, but accepted with an alacrity which shows agreement in advance.
Above all, there was the ingenious Equivalent, a sum of #398,085, 10
shillings, said to be compensation to the Scots for accepting a share in
the English national debt, but also to the shareholders for the
abolition of the Darien company. In any case it was to be repaid by the
Scots through excise duty. ''In fact,'' as Walter Scott wrote, ''the
Parliament of Scotland was bribed with the public money belonging to
their own country. In this way, Scotland herself was made to pay the
price given to her legislators for the sacrifice of her independence.''
In addition there was an increase in straightforward bribery. When
Lockhart was a member of the British Parliament in 1711 he was a member
of a commission to inquire into public accounts. He discovered records
of the secret disbursement of #20,000 through the Earl of Glasgow in
1706. Two letters have survived in which Glasgow confirms this and says
that if it had become known at the time, ''the Union had certainly
broken''.
Behind all this was the ultimate persuader, discreet but real military
intimidation. In 1703 the English Lord Treasurer, Godolphin, made an
unmistakable threat in a letter to the Scottish Chancellor, Seafield, in
which he reminded him of the great increase in the wealth and power of
England. During the debate on the treaty in the Scottish Parliament in
1706, English troops were moved to the Border.
The English Government thus achieved the Union of 1707 by means of a
remarkably sophisticated and elaborate operation. It involved spying,
infiltration, and propaganda (in which the skilful and tireless Daniel
Defoe was engaged); the threat of economic sanctions and of military
force; systematic bribery and seductive appeals to the self-interest of
the few men who had to be won over. It may seem like an excessive effort
to win a few votes in the Scottish Parliament, but great issues were at
stake.
The English aim was the final achievement of a centuries-old
objective; to bring Scotland under their control and remove a potential
threat to their northern Border.
To Scotland it meant the loss of the independence defended against
heavy odds for more than 300 years. The law, the church, the burghs, and
education continued as before, but they were all subject to interference
by the new Parliament of Great Britain. In this Scotland, with about the
same representation as Cornwall, was in an impotent minority. According
to the treaty, the Parliaments of both England and Scotland were
abolished and replaced by this new creation. In the words of Tom Scott,
it was ''a historical iniquity with no right but might behind it''.

LOOK, if hippiedom's coming back, I'm off. All those grubby toes and
beards like Shredded Wheat. Oh, please, no. The portents are not good.
Already those harbingers of doomed musicians, the disc jockeys, are
warning of a massive revival of Grateful Dead songs, such as the catchy
Mississippi Uptown Halfstep Toodle-oo which, as one tear-streaked
middle-aged music correspondent confided in the Independent, offers us
the chance to hear the late Jerry Garcia playing ''like an angel weeping
over the end of the world''.
You should be prepared for a mass outbreak of cheesecloth and angels
with dirty feet.
Flags flew at half mast in San Francisco; the governor of
Massachusetts wore a black ribbon; a senator from Vermont, dabbing
red-rimmed eyes, morosely recalled that he'd lunched with Jerry just a
few weeks ago. It was such a shock. He'd never seen him look better.
Certainly not since the last time he came off a three-decade-old acid,
cocaine, and heroin habit.
Kurt Cobain at least had the sense to go young, before needing specs
to find his plectrum; Sid Vicious signalled rebellious youth with a
couple of fingers, an antidote to wearisome chunter from such as, em,
the Grateful Dead. And at least Frank Zappa trimmed his facial hair.
Stitched up by the tenuous threads of fate, dropping dead in a rehab
clinic, Jerry Garcia is responsible for more excesses, from
patchouli-scented candles and mind-numbing music to bad party food and
silly conversations, than almost any other musician of his time.
News that he'd passed on to that great merchandising hype in the sky
left his legions of fans dazed, the international wire services told us,
without explaining how you could tell the difference.
Grizzled and grey and even bald, they don't even have youth to excuse
them. Some even, scarey thought, run the world. You may be surprised to
know, or perhaps not, that so many stunned and grief-stricken Wall
Street traders called up the story from the electronic news service that
the system crashed.
It is impossible, intoned a mourner in the columns of a deadly serious
London-based newspaper, to talk about Jerry Garcia seriously without
lapsing into religious language. Which he did, at length, likening the
music to ''a sort of sacrament, an outward and audible sign of a shared
inner grace''.
It is impossible, gasped your correspondent, picking herself off the
floor again to wade through elegies for a 53-year-old self-inflicted
diabetic who took three decades imposing his drugs habit and gloomy
music on us without choking, as seriously as after an overdosing
inhalation of joss sticks.
Try this one:
Listening to the music would take you a long way out into darkness and
chaos, but there was a sense of homecoming (phew, thank goodness for
that) with the reassurance that the universe did have a place for you
and the herald was Garcia . . . . with his guitar lines rippling and
leaping like water running back to the ocean . . . . his warm strained
voice always seemed to be coming past a smile.
And here were we muttheads thinking he just played a guitar in a band.
It's only a matter of time, of course, before the sightings begin --
lurking in shops selling woven headbands and mystical sandals held on by
no more than the callouses between those grubby toes; on the number 710
bus to Turriff: behind the incense counter at your local lentil shop.
False sightings are very likely.
If you find it hard to tell whether the portly, grey-haired gent
really is Jerry, take a hint from another reverential obit in another
previously wholly serious newspaper: ask if he's the one whose ''music
could stop the whole world and roll it away on a different track and
that to listen to it was a communal epiphany''. Music, so we're told,
which ''seemed to grow out of a conversation with the audience''.
So try conversing in a vocabulary involving words such as hey, yeh,
like, wow. Next, offer him floor space for the night. If he stays for
more than three years, disappears on Midsummer Night with your record
collection and a tea-strainer, leaves behind nought but an ingrained
sleeping bag and a Grateful Dead T-shirt, you'll at least know you've
got the right man, in spirit if not in body.

BECAUSE the bookshelves are brimming with travel writing of
unsurpassed brilliance it doesn't mean you've missed the boat. Catch the
Glasgow to London shuttle then walk from Heathrow Terminal 1 back to
Scotland in just what you're wearing -- no money, map, or spare socks.
Seek directions from Audi drivers, girls chewing gum while wearing
headphones, and men with whippets. Persist till you get an answer.
Record the conversation. As you walk, develop an unfashionable theory of
where we're all going wrong. When you write, stop short of solutions.
Avoid artless eulogies. Malicious anthropology is the way to go, so if
you're only good at scenery, forget it.
Many and complex are the perils of travel writing in an over-explored
world. There are the amateurs doing it in aid of animal charities,
idiots doing it on skateboards. And between the Scylla of Plagiarism and
the Charybdis of Whimsy there now lurks the Hag of Political
Correctness, ready to dispatch any traveller who has not mastered
contemporary techniques for being funny about foreigners.
In 1915 Norman Douglas could write of Calabria: ''Of course the inns
are often dirty . . . the reason is that, like Turks or Jews, their
owners do not see dirt''. Robert Byron in the thirties gets off with
''the mincing assertiveness of the modern Persian'', Gertrude Bell
proclaims confidently that ''the Egyptians have forgotten the miseries
from which our administration rescued them'' while Dr Johnson's Highland
tour produced ''Seeing Scotland, Madam, is only seeing a worse
England''.
But as travellers thrive on danger, so do travel writers jostle
creatively to overcome taboos. The set-piece dialogue in direct speech
is now a standard comedy routine, calculated to disclose the negative
mindset of a nation through the words of a man on a bus, but giving away
just as much about the author as he eggs on, provokes, or snatches the
last word.
Thus Jeremy Seal to a smoker in Turkey in A Fez Of The Heart. '' 'Why
does the Koran forbid drinking?' 'It makes you feel bad. It is not good
for you.' 'And if there had been cigarettes, especially Turkish
cigarettes, at the time of the Koran, do you not think your book would
have banned them? . . . ' 'Allah foresees everything.' 'All right,' I
said. 'Pork'.''
Paul Theroux to a distinguished man in The Great Railway Bazaar: ''
'Ask him what he does. Is he a writer?' 'This,' said the man through Mrs
Nur, 'is a completely meaningless question. One cannot say in a few
words what one is or does. That takes months, sometimes years. I can
tell you my name. Beyond that you have to find out for yourself.' 'Tell
him he's too much work,' I said and walked away.''
Erudition, indeed, is the common denominator of the new flush of young
travel writers. William Dalrymple (In Xanadu and City of Djinns) was the
senior history scholar at Cambridge while Christa Paula, who risked life
and virtue in the forbidden zone of Xinjiang to reach lost Buddhist
shrines on The Road to Miran, has degrees in Central Asian art and
archaeology. While the great scholar-travellers of the early twentieth
century traded on their mien of higher enlightenment, Dalrymple
travelled under a load of Chinese coal and Paula disguished herself as a
male Pathan.
Colin Thubron spent a year learning Mandarin in order to achieve the
qualified intimacy with the post-Mao Chinese that makes Behind The Wall
such a great book. ''The opening-up of China stirred me unbearably,'' he
wrote. ''It was like discovering a new room in a house in which you'd
lived all your life.''
It is these locked and haunted rooms that compensate for the shrinking
world, building new mythologies for today as contemporary eye-witness
accounts start to run out. Genghis Khan's fabulous empire -- Samarkand,
Tashkent -- and the great ruins of Turkmenistan and Tajikistan were
already locked up in the Soviet empire as the Islamic art fanatic Robert
Byron travelled along the Persian side of the border in the thirties.
Now it is Iran that is off limits -- and Thubron has been quick off the
mark again with The Lost Heart Of Asia, on the now independent and open
former USSR states.
The ending of apartheid has inspired a flush of South African books,
but one of the best recent books on the Dark Continent has been Black
American writer Eddy L Harris's Native Stranger for which he travelled
from the desert countries to the Cape on foot, and on low-grade public
transport to see how it felt to be African: ''But I lope when I walk and
swagger a little . . . My walk is not an African walk''.
He concluded: ''If I didn't know it then I know it now. I am a product
of the culture that raised me.''
Why do travellers travel? Jonathan Raban wrote Arabia because he
became fascinated by veiled women and shivering men dressed for the
desert in Earls Court, then made the small boat journey down the
Mississippi through middle America for Old Glory because he read
Huckleberry Finn when he was seven.
Patrick Leigh Fermor walked across pre-war Europe at the age of 18 out
of juvenile disaffection and bad school reports -- divine intervention
surely giving us two of the best ever travel books, A Time Of Gifts and
Between The Woods and the Water. Benedict Allen was drawn to Stone Age
tribes -- in Papua New Guinea (Into The Crocodile Nest) and the Amazon
(Through Jaguar Eyes).
Mark Cocker in Loneliness and Time, his insightful study of British
travel writing in the twentieth century, finds that the ascetic and the
traveller share much common ground, so that bicycling across America may
be just a mopping up of the residual urge to go on pilgrimages. He also
finds that competition, jealousy, and exclusivity have been rife among
travellers from Hanning and Speke to Freya Stark and beyond. ''It is
characteristic of the vehement individualism of the travel constituency
that its vehicle for literary expression is a work invariably narrated
in the first person singular.''
Well, who wants a dispassionate travel book? Good travel writers were
put on earth to stoke the fires of divine discontent. Their books
provoke aspirations, journeys, and more books.
And yah boo to another research study's view of the humble package
tourist as the real traveller's generic opposite, a person seeking ''the
security of pure cliche''. On a Friday night summer charter every
passenger is an ice-cool ace traveller. All that drinking is in case he
lets it show.

* LITERATURE'S first fax feud flew between Britain's wicked witch
columnist, Julie Burchill, and American academic and motor-mouth,
Camille Paglia, in spring, 1993.
Burchill had recently trashed the professor's book in the Spectator.
Then the editor of the now-defunct pop culture mag Modern Review offered
Paglia the opportunity to review No Exit, Burchill's novel. This only
inflamed her anger: ''I no longer take you seriously as a thinker or as
a personality,'' she quickly faxed back.
Burchill told her, in effect, to fax off. ''I'm not nice. I'm not as
loud as you, but if push comes to shove I'm nastier. I'm 10 years
younger, two stone heavier, and I haven't had my nuts taken off by
academia.''
Paglia plied her with pity: ''Your review . . . was not about my book
but about yourself. It contains a shadowy, tragic -- or should I say
pathetic -- history of your life . . . As a teacher I can't help but
feel sorry for you.''
Burchill scratched: ''Dear Professor Paglia, **** off, you crazy old
dyke.'' And so the battle ended with no words minced.

IT was January. Ford phoned me. ''Guess what,'' he panted. In our
house it was the usual teatime bedlam. In a reversal of the loaves and
fishes scenario our kids seem to be able to make enough noise to make it
seem like the screaming of the 5000. I didn't have time for this hassle.
''Em . . . I don't know,'' I said irritatedly, ''what is it?''
''How d'ye fancy doing a play? Castlemilk People's Theatre have asked
us to write one for this year's Edinburgh Festival.''
My heart sank as I realised he had another of his schemes in mind.
''When do they want it?''
''July. It'll be no bother. We'll cobble it together in a few weeks,
don't worry.'' The phone was down. I might have known. He'd already said
yes for me.
Ford has a huge capacity for optimism on these occasions. He always
reckons that if he's not an expert at something, then it's only because
no-one's offered him the chance to do it yet. I've now noticed that he's
usually right, and you can only admire chutzpah like that: even if you
can't admire it, it's difficult not to let yourself be carried along
with the manic enthusiasm. As usual, within minutes he had me believing
that a London West End run was only weeks away; that Cameron Mackintosh
would be begging for the rights to stage the musical, and Andrew Lloyd
Webber had already started work on the score. I was well and truly
hooked.
Being decisive arty types, that night we had a meeting in the pub and
sketched out a plan on the back of a beer mat. We had decided we would
write about comedy -- or the career of a 1970s comedian to be more
precise. After a further two weeks of regular pub meetings we had handed
in a preliminary synopsis to the theatre group, slightly changed the
plot, had a meeting with the group, made a few plot alterations, handed
in a more detailed synopsis, and had it accepted. During the next six
weeks things largely stabilised out and, from what I remember, we only
made about 19 radical changes to the original script.
Come March the synopsis was finally accepted and, like the
professional writers we thought we were, we agreed to hand in the final,
full bhoona, proper, definitive draft on the first of June. In April we
had a few polite but slightly anxious calls inquiring as to how the
script was getting on. Ford responded to these with his usual bullish
verve, and this seemed to do the trick. By the time mid-May arrived the
phone calls were just as polite, but a bit more apprehensive. The
publicity material had already been placed in the Festival Fringe
programme at considerable expense, and did we have a preliminary version
ready for them to see? At this we decided we really better get on and
write something. Despite Ford's confidence, these brainstorming sessions
were not the easiest of times.
Writing the play (or as the Castlemilk crew keep telling me, the show)
was a laborious, painstaking process. The play, sorry, show, was
originally supposed to be a monologue, spoken by a seventies comedian of
declining repute; our job was made easier once we met Pat, the star of
the show. He had a face very reminiscent of Bob Carolgees, the man
behind Tiswas' Spit the Dog, and he admitted to being a bit of a
comedian manque. Although not a professional actor, he was desperate to
play the part. In terms of stature, bearing, posture, and attitude, the
play was really written for him.
Our spring days were spent in front of a computer arguing for 20
minutes over a single word. I couldn't believe how often the simplest
sentence had to be jigged around to make it sound as if it had been
uttered by a bad comic -- a classic case of something being written from
experience. Among Ford's talents is that of being an excellent prose
detector. Every sentence was dissected to see if it sounded like
spontaneous speech, and if it didn't he would launch into a 10-minute
tirade: ''Nobody talks like that . . . that's like one of your cruddy
articles . . . get real!''
Call me King Sensitive, but comments like that tend to make me a bit
touchy. I can't believe some of the arguments we had. ''I'm telling you,
he would never have said 'dobber', he would have said 'gok!' ''
Eventually the script began to take shape, amazingly with no major
bloodshed (we settled on ''dobber'', in case you're interested). Words
can barely express the mixture of relief and pride I experienced as I
faxed the finished article over to Tracey, the Castlemilk group's head
honcho. If reading your finished script is like looking at your baby,
then giving it to someone else is like handing it over for adoption. As
you see it grow up, you notice things you really like, and other
characteristics that you don't. Deep down, though, you love it -- if
only because it's yours. Ultimately, whether it stands or falls is down
to whether it's well written or not. At least, that's what I felt as I
drove up to the Eastfield Community Centre in Cambuslang last Tuesday
for the play's, sorry, show's world premiere.
Beside me was the most severe critic I know, my wife. She could damn
the biggest cinematic spectacle in the world with the phrase ''It's all
right.'' It's a killer sentence because it's short for, ''It's alright
if you've nothing better to do and you're sad enough to need a reel of
film to make life worth living.'' Both my parents were there. My Dad is
the least severe critic I know, especially where his family are
concerned: if I wrote a Jackie Collins-type novel he would acclaim it as
the follow-up to Ulysses.
I couldn't have been more nervous if I were performing it myself, but
once my nerves disappeared, I began to enjoy it. I was a bit sensitive
to the crowd's reaction, and every swear word (not that there were that
many) jarred like an ice lolly on a sore tooth. The audience didn't mind
it though. If there's only one thing better than saying something that
makes an audience laugh, it's seeing someone else getting a laugh from a
line that you've written. I came out on an absolute high. I went to
Tracey, almost speechless with relief. ''Well Tracey, that went well,
didn't it?''
''Yeah, it was alright. These guys laugh at anything.''

SHARDS OF MEMORY
Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
John Murray, #15.99
DISCARD any broken-teapot connotations and think of the shards of
antiquity, tough little things that outlive the artefact while being
obliged to it for their existence. In just such a way do the separate
personal histories of the strong characters in this story,
Germano-Russo-Jewish-Indian-American-English, survive and overshadow the
hazy eastern cult which has brought about their meetings and matings.
The cult, a Jajneesh-type movement with no name begun by the Master,
an eastern mystic who variously enthrals, motivates, irritates, and in
one case possibly impregnates a wealthy New York family across five
generations, casts a very light shadow on these pages, its founder more
Prospero than Messiah, medium than message.
It is through the agency of Mme Richter, an emigre White Russian sent
to carry the word to America (the Master can't get a visa), that his
mission first reaches the Kopt family along with piano lessons. Their
daughter Elsa, preferring ideas to music, is summoned to London to meet
him and, the Master having gone off elsewhere, meets and marries Kavi, a
handsome young Indian poet.
However, none of the romantic pairings in this story is to be much
more than a wayside stop until destiny of an alternative style kicks in.
It is only after their daughter Baby (they are too disaffected to come
up with a name) marries Graeme, an English diplomat, that Elsa finds
true love with Graeme's aunt Cynthia, another born disciple, and reaches
fulfilment in a gruff pre-Enlightenment Hampstead menage running the
movement's London HQ.
Kavi in turn finds his niche running his mother-in-law's New York
household, turning his creativity to French cooking as the household
expands to contain the separated Baby, her single-parent daughter
Renata, the child's supposed father Carl, and the child Henry,
brilliant, precocious, born on the day the Master died, and bearing,
curiously, his slanted eastern eyes, though as Renata recalls it the
Master on their one meeting merely ran his hands over her.
As the book opens the adult Henry, having sorted the Master's papers
and passed on control of the revived movement to his parents in its New
York headquarters, Head And Heart House, has begun instead to research
the great man's personality and its influence on the lives of his
family. Like the other thinking members of the family he is a sceptic.
The duller members -- Renata, Carl, Elsa -- are much given to belief.
Since these qualities seem to alternate, the closest family bonds are
formed across generations, Baby, now a feisty and coquettish matron,
emerging as mediator.
All of this makes for an intense and vivid dynastic saga at the
domestic level while, with scrupulous reticence, Jhabvala is playing
clever games with the nature of belief and the primacy of human need and
impulse. As the ageing and disabled family members return, one by one,
to the New York household, they begin to pool and to live through their
memories, and the Master, revived in anecdote, becomes increasingly
mythic and elusive.
Kavi met him fomenting rebellion among the young intellectuals of
pre-independence Bombay. Graeme encountered him in the Himalayas fresh
from meditating in a cave above the snowline in order to bring to an end
the Second World War. Jhabvala hints that it is also possible to alter
people's lives without the trappings of divinity: a powerful Middle
Eastern politician known as The Niece, now assassinated, reveals in her
diaries that a girlhood meeting with Graeme as a young diplomat was a
turning point in her life.
This is a novel triumphant with life and experience, the novel of
someone born in Poland, brought up in England, married to an Indian, who
lives in Delhi and New York, who writes Merchant-Ivory film scripts and
is a long-since Booker winner, and who doesn't need you to notice her
writing.

BLACK SEA
Neal Ascherson
Jonathan Cape, #17.99
TO WRITE history about a geographical concept is often an excellent
idea. It reveals surprises, unexpected affinities, relationships which
enrich one another. The author has the joy of weaving patterns that
nobody has found before. The reader has the pleasure of recognising
familiar sights in a new light.
The prime examples are Fernand Braudel's work on the Mediterranean,
acknowledged after half a century as one of the great modern feats of
historical imagination, and Claude Magris's portrait of the Danube,
which may in time come to occupy the same status.
Neal Ascherson's book could be just as evocative. The Black Sea has an
inborn place in his heart. His father served there as a midshipman in
the British fleet which evacuated one of the last White Armies as the
Bolsheviks closed in on it. There is a poignant passage about that
incident, and the battle-hardened soldiers who had given their all for
the old Russia, standing on the foredecks of the Royal Navy's ships,
staring wordlessly at the mountains and forests of a motherland they
would never see again, until a haar obscured them.
Ascherson has besides his own experience of the long-delayed requiting
of that tragedy, as one of the foreign correspondents who most closely
followed the collapse of the Soviet empire.
So he has been in personal touch with a complete historical cycle, and
his scholarly tastes have led him into the picturesque by-ways of many
more. It is odd, then, what an unsatisfactory book all this produces.
The main fault is that Ascherson is not interested in entire regions
round the Black Sea. Bulgaria and Romania, which bound it to the west,
merit only a line apiece in his index. Turkey, which occupies its
longest and southern littoral, fares little better, with six lines in
the index, the same as for the very much smaller nation of Georgia.
Ascherson's gaze is fixed rather on the northern shores, on the Ukraine
which gets nine lines and on Russia which gets 14.
His gaze is fixed there not because of the Ukraine and Russia,
however, but because of Poland, which has 17 lines of index. Poland? But
does Poland not lie on the Baltic? Well, nowadays it does of course, but
there was a time, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when it
stretched that far south. Britain nearly went to war in 1791 to stop the
Russians seizing the seaport of Ochakov from the Poles, though curiously
this is an episode which Ascherson ignores.
But nothing more purely Polish eludes his purview. The Poles get in
most often because their old nobility believed themselves descended from
the Sarmatians, a barbarian tribe which wandered round the Black Sea.
The Romans posted a legion recruited from the Sarmatians to Lancashire,
and Ascherson vaguely hopes that one day the advance of genetic science
will be able to prove that the people of Ribblesdale are, in fact,
Poles.
A famous Polish poet, Adam Mickiewicz, lived in Odessa. Polish
patriots fleeing the oppression of their people by the Czar set up a
colony at Polonezkoy in Turkey. And so on.
It is rather as if someone were to write a history of the North Sea by
reference to what the Italians had done there, from the medieval bankers
of Bruges to the modern chip shops of Kirkcaldy.
We need not doubt that the Poles are a splendid people. But it is
going a bit far to conceive everybody else's history as a mere
commentary on theirs.

A Wild and Open Sea
James Miller
Orkney Press, #14.99
ON the sloping attic ceiling above my workbench is pinned a spread of
Ordnance Survey maps of the northern extremities of the Scottish
mainland and the Northern Isles. One of them shows the northern edge of
Caithness and the South Isles of Orkney separated by a blue, untroubled
and neatly squared expanse of water -- The Pentland Firth.
What a lie this chart contains!
The truth is that the Pentland Firth is held by mariners to be one of
the most dangerous stretches of water in the world, a place where reefs,
islands, the seabed and the weather combine to distort the tides in a
quite spectacular manner and to produce ''rivers'' within the sea which
can race at almost 11 knots.
As a twentieth century Admiralty guide warns seafarers: ''Streams (in
the Firth) run very strongly, eddies of great extent and strength form
and there are races and overfalls of tremendous violence.''
Robert Louis Stevenson put it more directly. It was, he said, a
graveyard of mariners.
Phenomena such as the Men of Mey, a two-mile wall of water, fully
active three hours after the ebb, with breakers reaching 40 feet and the
Swelkie, said by a thirteenth century Norwegian historian to be the
greatest of the world's whirlpools, a fearful place where boats simply
vanish make this a truly formidable location.
Brought up in Keiss, to the south of the Firth, James Miller has
produced a book which has been 20 years in the making and which tells
the story of the Pentland Firth from the distant times when there was a
land bridge between the Scottish mainland and the North Isles to the
present day.
Informative and entertaining, Miller's book is a weave of hard fact
and nostalgia, legend and statistics and is destined to become a
definitive work. He writes with humour, understanding and compassion of
the hardy communities along the Caithness and Orkney shores of the
Firth, for whom this turbulent location forms a backdrop to everyday
life.
There are stories of press gangs -- one Orcadian (pressed) and a
Caithness man (unpressed) served on Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar --
and of kelp gathering, of brave men out at the fishing and the
long-suffering women who waited, their superstitions and the harvests
gathered from the seas, everything from saithe to sperm whale, of the
island communities of Swona and Stroma anchored amid the vortex and of
the coastguard and lifeboatsmen.
Miller tells of the couthy down-to-earth folk who were in tune with
their often cruel environment and with the practical realities of living
on the edge of a maelstrom. There were the Pentland pilots, a remarkable
breed of men. When an approaching ship needed a pilot they signalled and
from the villages along the coast the pilots would set out, rowing or
sailing, the first to reach the vessel normally being assured the job.
The pilot's boat was either towed behind or he was landed west-away
along the coast and obliged to trudge home on foot.
Occasionally an ungrateful or impatient captain might not release the
pilot until they had reached a foreign port. James Mowat in 1869 won the
race to the Confidence, outward bound from Newcastle. Next landfall for
Mowat was in Quebec where he came ashore wearing the same carpet
slippers which had been on his feet weeks before when he jumped up from
the fireside in his eagerness to secure the job.
In the 1850s the arrival of steam spelled the end of the Pentland
pilots. The last man to guide a vessel under sail through the firth is
thought to be James Rosie from Swona in 1900.
Almost 600 vessels use the Firth each year. And with the recent news
that the Flotta oil terminal in Scapa Flow had secured the first
contract for the trans-shipment of oil from the new fields to the
Norwest, it is certain that this stretch of water will remain busy.
For the independent traveller, however, there is one piece of advice.
No matter how good a sailor you consider yourself, come prepared.
Chances are you'll have a beautiful sail to Orkney; but it's also
possible you'll learn why the principal Pentland ferry is known to the
locals as the roly poly Ola.

THE cost of employing auditors in the National Health Service has more
than doubled within a year, according to figures released by a Labour MP
yesterday.
The UK total soared from just over #18m in 1992-93 to more than #39m
in 1993-94, a rise of 128%. The Scottish figure rose from #444,000 to
#740,000. England's went up from #16.2m to #35.9m, the Welsh figure rose
from #1.3m to #2.2m, and Northern Ireland's went up from #166,000 to
#201,000.
Mr Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington, obtained the figures through
parliamentary questions. He said the growth in the number of competing
NHS organisations explained the massive rise in auditors' costs.
''Accountants are taking over the NHS. By creating competing trusts
within a health-care market, the Government has sent administrative
costs soaring in the NHS.''
''This boom in auditors' fees is now diverting precious resources from
the sharp end of patient care.'' He said he would be urging Health
Secretary Stephen Dorrell to clamp down on auditors' costs in the light
of his recent comments about cutting down on health bureaucracy.

PAUL CELAN -- POET, SURVIVOR, JEW
John Felstiner
Yale University Press, #19.95
HE was a German poet who never lived in Germany; a poet of the
Holocaust whose skeletal poems can never be called confessional. He was
a master translator whose elliptical verse resists translation and his
name was an anagram. Twenty-five years after his suicide, Paul Celan
remains the enigma of post-war European poetry.
To say so in Britain, where ignorance of ''foreign'' verse remains
unshakeable, is to say nothing. Even among people who regard themselves
as educated, Celan does not exist. Like Ungaretti or Popa, Bobrowski or
Pasolini, Eluard or Ritsos, Transtromer, Char, or Amichai, his is one of
the chief voices yet it is, literally, all but unheard.
Efforts have been made. Carcanet published Nineteen Poems in 1971;
Penguin put out a selection in 1972; and Carcanet tried again with
Michael Hamburger's translation of Poems (1980). As recently as 1986
Carcanet issued the aptly meagre (67 pages, including appendices)
Collected Prose. Yet who claims much real knowledge of the man George
Steiner has called ''almost certainly the major European poet of the
period after 1945''? Part of this, it must be said, has something to do
with the nature of Celan's art. Introducing the Penguin translations,
the best the indefatigable Hamburger could say was that the poet
''occupies a prominent, isolated, and anomalous position''. Felstiner
adds that Celan was born ''in what soon became the wrong place and
time''. Bad luck or fate made sure he would never fit in, wherever he
happened to be.
His was a German-speaking Jewish family living on the eastern fringe
of what had been the Austrian Empire and which became, just before
Celan's birth in 1920, part of Romania. Czernowitz, his home town and
the capital of the Bukovina region, was occupied first by the USSR, then
the Nazis, and retaken by the Russians in 1944. In the interval, while
he toiled in a forced labour camp, Celan's parents were exterminated.
In 1945 he was in Bucharest, working as a translator and publisher's
reader; 1947 found him in Vienna; and in 1948 he moved to Paris, where
he soon obtained his Licencees Lettres and found a position teaching
German literature at the Ecole Normale Superieure. Over the years he
translated poets as diverse as Mandelshtam (as Felstiner renders the
Russian's name), Shakespeare, and Emily Dickinson. A strong swimmer, his
body was found in the Seine by a fisherman on May 1, 1970, 10 days after
he had disappeared.
Through all this the 800 poems Celan wrote between 1938 and 1970
became, in his own words, ''a message in a bottle''. On 1300 occasions
in his verse, according to his biographer, he addressed himself to
''du'' ('thou'' or ''you'' used intimately). He spoke directly, whether
to God, plants, King Lear, or the Jewish dead in an apparent effort to
focus his eloquence on the problem of language itself.
All writers share the task, but for Celan the difficulty was immense.
Here he was, at the centre of a generation rendered speechless by the
Holocaust, writing in his mother tongue, yet it was the same tongue used
by those who had murdered his own mother. Fascism had appropriated the
German language (''this Death is a master from Deutschland'', he wrote
in the great Todesfuge), yet that language, like Judaism, was part of
Celan's heritage and his poetry. ''I do not believe,'' he said once,
''in bilingualness in poetry . . . Poetry -- that is the fateful
uniqueness of language''.
Felstiner's is an amazing piece of work. Most biographers like to
believe they are giving equal weight to life and art but few do.
Bringing both elements together in a seamless narrative, matching
incident with analysis, tends to result in those immense, enervating
tomes to which American academics seem addicted, books in which
everything is reported and nothing illuminated.
Felstiner, perhaps because he recognises translation as the central
problem of Celan's art -- and one of its central preoccupations -- has
produced one of very few books in which a poet's life (where poetry is
life, and vice versa) begins to make sense. His technique is to describe
the problems presented by translation and to link each of the poems'
nuances, their obvious and concealed meanings, their imagery and their
structure, to his subject's existence. The going is sometimes difficult,
but the journey is worth the trouble. ''To grow attentive, especially in
translating, is,'' Felstiner writes, ''to activate these poems.''
And what sort of poet? Scriptural, minimalist, haunting, political,
German, Jewish, one who could write ''Thirteenth of February. In the
heartmouth/ an awakened Shibboleth. With you,/ Peuple/ de Paris. No
pasaran.'' yet remain, somehow, always alone.
''In Celan,'' writes Felstiner, ''the ''strain' of Jewishness means
both the trace and the tension of it.'' He said it himself (''No-one/
witnesses for the/ witness'') and allowed no-one to see him die. This
book, fine though it is, is the least he deserved.

<HEADLINE>Woman loses bid for sex equality in invalidity benefit</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976928864</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WOMAN seeking the same level of invalidity benefit as men lost her
case yesterday when the European Court of Justice ruled against her.
Mrs Rose Graham, of Liverpool, challenged the Department of Social
Security when it reduced her benefit when she reached the age of 60.
She claimed the Government was discriminating against women because
men were able to receive the higher invalidity benefit until they
reached their state pension age of 65.
The court ruled that the Government was not in breach of European law
requiring equal treatment of men and women in social security payments.
The Equal Opportunities Commission, which backed Mrs Graham's case,
said it was ''very disappointed'' with the decision, which could affect
thousands of women.
Deputy chairwoman Ms Diana Brittan said: ''Today's decision is bad
news for many women who, unlike men, will not be able to receive full
invalidity benefit for an extra five years.
''Discrimination at any age is unfair. Discrimination in older age,
when incomes are often lower, is a greater injustice.
''The state pension ages should not be used to create more sex
discrimination in the social security system.''
Mrs Graham's entitlement to invalidity benefit dropped by #35 a week
when she reached 60.
A man of the same age and state of health would have been allowed the
increased benefit until the age of 65.
Mrs Graham won her case before a social security appeal tribunal and
then before the social security commissioners before it was referred to
the European court.
Mrs Graham, 65, said: ''I am disappointed for the other women affected
but the fight will continue for all women who have been discriminated
against.''
Her solicitor, Mr Phil Shiner, said at least 41,000 similar cases
would be affected by yesterday's ruling.
He accused the Government of ''hiding'' behind court cases as a way of
not complying with a European directive on payment of social security
benefits.
''The Government insists on treating each benefit or form of
discrimination as a single issue and fighting it through the courts.
''This should stop and there should be a fundamental review of the
social security system, which should be equalised for men and women over
pensionable age.''
The Department of Social Security said in a statement: ''We welcome
the judgment, which has supported arguments put forward by the
Government. We are studying the terms of the ruling.''
Ms Liz Lynne, Liberal Democrat social security spokeswoman, said the
ruling was ''very bad news'' for all women.
''Invalidity benefit in particular was a contributory benefit and
women have paid the same amount in as men. They should get the same
amount out.
''In the same way as we have called for equalisation of state
pensions, we have also called for men and women to be treated equally
with regard to other benefits.''

TECHNICAL difficulties have again grounded attempts to get an air
service between Prestwick and London off the ground.
Last month, the operators of the Ayrshire airport were set to announce
a low-cost operation linking Prestwick and London's Stansted. Local
politicians were to join Lord Younger, chairman of PIK Holdings, and
airport chief executive Mr Matthew Hudson at a launch in Glasgow.
At the last minute, however, the event was postponed until Tuesday of
next week with airport management blaming ''unforeseen regulatory
delays'' in setting up the service.
Now the launch has been postponed yet again, this time with PIK
officials saying that there has been ''a further technical hitch''.
Mr Hudson was unavailable for comment but an airport spokesman said:
''Regrettably the launch has been postponed again. We hope to announce a
further date for the announcement early next week.'' He would not
elaborate on the cause for the delay.
It is understood that PIK is working closely with British World
Airways to form a new company known as Skyair with the London service
being the first of a number of low-cost air services aimed at the
tourism and leisure markets.
So-called peanut airlines -- which serve only soft drinks and peanuts
on their services -- are the fastest growing sector of the US market.

HIV-NEGATIVE: HOW THE UNINFECTED ARE AFFECTED BY AIDS
William I Johnston
Insight Books/Plenum Press, #19.96; pbk #11.96
SAD to say, given some gruesome consequences of the gay life,
homosexuality was usually treated as a funny subject in Scotland in the
darling days of the 1960s and 1970s. I remember going to a deeply
forgettable Edinburgh Festival Fringe play at which actors invited
members of the audience to participate by standing up to admit they were
all homosexuals. Scottish poet Sydney Goodsir Smith stood up and
laughingly roared at the actors: ''Speak for yourselves!''
I remember an amusing proletarian friend asking an allegedly
effeminate actor: ''Tell me straight, you are bent?'' Your average
Jock's perception of homosexuality was a bit of a joke.
In 1980 I visited Boston (Mass.) and, in my ignorance of the city,
walked into a pub I quickly realised was a queer place. There was no
cheer, only fear, and that because the boozers felt threatened by an
observer who was not one of them. I made my excuses and left them to
their own devices. Later I saw the likes of them marching with banners
in the streets of Boston so they were determinedly gay by day and taken
by fright at night. They had a right to fright as many of them knew
their days and nights were numbered by a name that scared all citizens
over there and, afore long, over here.
Officially acknowledged as an epidemic by Uncle Sam in 1981, Aids was
one word that changed the world. Homosexuals had come out of their
closets and taken to the streets of San Francisco -- and Boston and New
York -- to assert their sexual rights and had been widely accepted as
acceptable members of society but Aids put them back where they began.
Upstandingly straight American society reacted to Aids by name-calling
homosexuals a disgrace to Uncle Sam in so many words.
Words condition our culture and the acronym Aids (acquired immuno
deficiency syndrome) and the abbreviation HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus) put real fear into the hearts, and other parts, of human beings
who first read them as signs of a sentence of death even when they were
nothing of the kind.
William Johnston tested HIV-negative in 1989 but felt grief rather
than relief. Afraid of irrational fears he participated in the Boston
HIV-negative support group so he could share his problems with other
HIV-negative gay men. He interviewed more than 45 of them with the
results you can read in this book. He hopes his book will help
HIV-negatives learn to live without fear of falling: ''We cannot learn
to trust our inner sense of balance if we never stand up.''
Apparently gay men feel sad and guilty when tested negative. So says
Anthony Tommasini in his contribution to the book. He was sad to be a
survivor when his friends were dying, guilty as he watched them go: ''I
find it hard to know what to say to Al, to know how to deal with this
guy who is dying who should not die. I find it so much harder than if I
were the person who was dying and he was the life force helping me
through whatever years I had.'' You get the picture and it's a grim one.
HIV-negatives can become infected with HIV if they have ''unsafe'' sex
with other men. Being homosexual means taking appalling risks as many of
the contributors admit. One speaks about sleeping with a score of
strangers in the early 1980s before being tested negative then briefly
believing he only wanted God on his side then going back to homosexual
promiscuity.
''Some people,'' says a man called Wolf, ''feel they are not 'gay
enough' unless they are infected.'' A man called Frank, described as a
fan of Barbra Streisand, recalls the time when he ''secretly wished to
be HIV-positive''. Johnston wants gay men to avoid the temptation of
committing slow suicide. He advises safe sex and assures HIV-negatives
there is a future worth staying uninfected for. The future for
homosexuals means coming to terms with what Johnston calls a
''fewtopia'', a world in which many gays will sadly die of Aids.
HIV-negative gay men, Johnston insists, must attempt to avoid Aids and
seek safety and build lives worth living ''without feeling that by doing
so they are abandoning the HIV-positive''. Johnston's fewtopian vision
gives new meaning to the needs of the negative.

OF LOVE &amp; OTHER DEMONS
Gabriel Garcia Marquez
Jonathan Cape, #13.99
IN September of last year Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the Mexican
novelist, Carlos Fuentes, were invited to dinner with Bill Clinton. El
Pais covered the occasion as a front-page story. On both sides of the
Atlantic Spanish-language newspapers wanted to know every last detail of
the evening. Had they discussed Cuba? What did the president have to say
about economic crisis in Mexico? NAFTA? US policy in central America?
The tradition of writer as political spokesperson and truth-teller
survives in Latin America with a price as high as the status it confers
on literature. For every great name which illuminates the century, from
Pablo Neruda to Octavio Paz, there are hundreds of lesser-known authors
imprisoned, on the run, murdered. The reponsibility that Gabriel Garcia
Marquez feels must be heavy.
In his 1982 Nobel Prize speech he spoke of the ''colossal reality'' of
Latin America, ''which lives with us and determines every instant of our
innumerable daily deaths, and which supports a fountain of insatiable
creation, full of misery and beauty''.
Marquez has always represented the hidden histories and political
conflicts of his continent in fantastic metaphorical form. In doing so
he has found a voice which is huge, but not specific. It leaves him with
a persistent quandary: does he respond to demands to reveal more
precisely what position he is taking? Or does he continue to search for
the universal but impotent image?
At first glance, Of Love &amp; Other Demons appears to aim for specifics.
It is set in a particular place: the Caribbean coast of Colombia. It
deals with a particular period of history: eighteenth-century colonial
occupation. Its themes revolve around distinct political issues:
conquest, slavery, miscegenation, religion. And its starting place is an
autobiographical sketch of an incident in Marquez's own life.
On October 26, 1949, as a young reporter, he was sent by his editor to
witness the exhumation of graves in an old convent. When labourers broke
open one particular tomb ''a stream of living hair the intense colour of
copper spilled out of the crypt''. It measured over 22 metres and
belonged to the skull of a young girl, superbly named Sierva Maria de
Todos los Angeles. The workmen seemed to think nothing of this event but
Marquez remembered a story his grandmother had told him. It was the
legend of a 12-year-old marquise with extraordinary hair who had
performed miracles and died of rabies.
Around this coincidence Marquez builds the story of a young,
terrifyingly beautiful girl who is abandoned by her parents and brought
up by slaves. She is untameable, speaks several African languages, and
never cuts her hair. When she is bitten by a rabid dog she is taken in
by the church and imprisoned in a convent where she is treated for
demonic possession. She is assigned an exorcist, Father Cayetano
Delaura, who is intellectual and fervent and humane, and who eventually
falls in love with her, thus destroying them both.
Despite the superficial period detail, this love story produces lurid
extremities in Marquez which completely obliterate any historical or
political investigation. It is a joy of tormented poetic excess which
never makes it to the stage of post-colonial study. Far from getting
into the prose world of comment and analysis and telling us what he
thinks, he has taken a leap yet further into the fabulous.
It is the Marquez style condensed and purified. It may be drained of
an ability to make committed statements in the way his admirers might
wish, but the power simply to astonish is intensified. For example this
is how he describes the degeneration of Sierva Maria's mother: ''Her
Gipsy eyes were extinguished and her wits dulled, she shat blood and
vomited bile, her siren's body became as bloated and coppery as a
three-day-old corpse, and she broke wind in pestilential explosions that
startled the mastiffs.''
The fact that Marquez can still produce a novel like Of Love &amp; Other
Demons is worth a great deal. His capacity to act as a commentator on
the Latin American scene is certainly diminished but that shouldn't
blind us to the power of his continuing presence. There is a precision
of storytelling and finesse of conception here which balances out a
tumultuous poetic gift and gives us something brilliant.

TROOPER Mark Campbell took part in a passing-out parade yesterday,
ready to become the first black soldier to join the Sovereign's escort
of the Household Cavalry and ride beside the Queen on state occasions.
The 28-year-old former postal worker will make his first public
appearance escorting the Queen during the VJ Day celebrations next
weekend.
''It will be a great honour to guard the Queen, who is
colonel-in-chief of my regiment,'' said Trooper Campbell, of Sedgley,
Wolverhampton.
His success in joining the Household Cavalry follows years of
pressure, spearheaded by the Prince of Wales, to break down barriers and
boost the recruiting of blacks.
The Household Division, which embraces the Household Cavalry and the
five Guards regiments, has been pilloried for failing to recruit from
ethnic minorities.
The Prince brought concerns out into the open when he confided his
anxiety about the lack of black faces among the Buckingham Palace guard.
Trooper Campbell, whose parents came to Britain from Jamaica in 1963,
was a TA reservist before joining full-time.
The passing-out ceremony at London's Hyde Park barracks marked the
culmination of an arduous training programme in which he was taught
horse-riding skills and soldiering.
''It's a great feeling sitting on my horse, O'Mally, in full uniform.
It makes me burst with pride,'' he said. ''I hope more West Indians
follow my lead.
''I can honestly say there has never been any bullying of any kind or
any racist remarks. I am fully accepted as 'one of the boys' and enjoy
my job. I'm proud to serve my country.''
An inquiry by the Commission for Racial Equality into how ethnic
minorities are treated in the Household Cavalry is now in its final
stages.

A 5FT Aberdeen supporter who climbed a 10ft fence to challenge rival
fans at a vital match was yesterday fined #400.
Andrew Scott, 17, clambered up a segregation fence at Brockville
''like a cat'' to shout abuse at Falkirk supporters when his side won
2-0 to avoid relegation.
When police arrested him, fellow Dons fans started a tug-of-war in a
bid to free him from two officers.
Falkirk Sheriff Court heard the 15,000 all-ticket game on May 13 was a
''needle match''.
Expecting trouble, police drafted in reinforcements to deal with the
crowd.
PC Stewart Ogg said Scott, of Logie Avenue, Aberdeen, climbed the
fence separating the rival fans ''like a cat''. He added: ''He was going
daft.'' Scott was shouting and swearing and giving rival fans ''the
finger''.
When PC Ogg and a colleague pulled him down, Scott struggled
violently. Then four Dons fans tried to free him.
PC Ogg said: ''It became a tug-of-war which we eventually won. As he
was being taken to the prison bus, he continued inciting Falkirk fans by
shouting abuse and spitting.''
Scott, a part-time shop worker, denied a breach of the peace and
resisting arrest.
But Sheriff Kenneth Forbes found him guilty. ''This was a needle
match,'' he said. ''But for the timely intervention of the police
officers, it couldhave led to a great deal of trouble.''

KING DAVID
Allan Massie
Sceptre, #15.99
ALLAN MASSIE'S trilogy of Roman novels are studies in power and
vulnerability, which expose ruthless follies and doubtful temperaments,
as well as the haphazard circumstances of fate and direction, of choices
and conspiracies.
For all their historical parentage, they have a thoroughly
contemporary feel. His device of using hitherto undiscovered memoirs,
complete with cod academics, translators and quibbles, give an intimacy
and voice that lends authenticity, making the intrigues, strategies and
weaknesses all the more plausible.
And though political motivation is at the heart, Allan Massie
communicates his understanding of how history is made by concentrating
on character and emotion. By surmising how a character felt, their
actions become clearer, the consequences within our reach.
With the Romans behind him, where could he go but to the Lord? The
Bible is the obvious choice of someone who wants to improve upon Roman
excesses. And David is the natural beginning: a man of great
contradiction and achievement whose public successes could never
compensate for the disasters of his personal life.
His triumphs are in the past and he records them lovingly, seemingly
unaware of his contradictions; shepherd and king, poet and giant-slayer,
lover of Bathsheba and Jonathan. Chosen by Samuel as the Anointed of
Israel, he was aware of his potential, felt no impatience, but was
prepared to wait, knowing his time would come.
Certainty, rather than patience or stoicism, is his most obvious
trait. Yet he emerges as a complex and cultivated young man, unconcerned
when his military prowess eclipses Saul's reputation, motivated by the
ruthless enthusiasms of the religious zealot who believes he is guided
by the hand of the Almighty. This has been the hallmark of the insane
throughout the ages, yet David offers simple explanation, rather than
justification.
For all that was done in God's name, the tenderness towards his lovers
is the biggest contradiction, loving both Saul's children, Jonathan and
Mical. These are the times when he envies his youth when he wants to
kill the girl beside him because she is young. This is where he begins
to question God's will, because things are not going as he would like.
All is set for his own act of betrayal, contriving the death of
Bathsheba's husband, so that he could have her for himself, which was
also his punishment, for her scheming and the advancement of her
children have tormented him and he knows God's vengeance will continue.
Among Allan Massie's greatest gifts as a novelist are his abilities to
conjure times other than our own and to people them with characters who
are not only believable, who fit the circumstances he gives them, but
whose intellectual and emotional lives we can understand. In giving the
act and telling how David felt, he does more than sketch the character.
He offers a plausible man, wracked doubt and weakness, rather than
Joseph Heller's wisecracking Jewish Everyman.
Allan Massie's reputation grows with each novel, leaving one in
admiration not only of his industry, but the quality, the intellectual
and emotional honesty of his work.

THOUSANDS of council tax payers in Scotland could be in line for a
cash windfall after the court victory of a Glasgow pensioner over his
council tax assessment.
Three Court of Session judges gave their ruling yesterday that the
assessor for Strathclyde region was wrong to put Mr Albert Rea's house
in a higher council tax band because he had installed double glazing and
extra central heating radiators.
The decision could lead to a massive reassessment exercise in other
parts of Scotland because other assessors have been using the same
approach as Strathclyde.
A spokesman for the council said: ''The regional council assessor's
department will have to consider the judgment in detail to see how it
may have to be applied in similar cases to Mr Rea's.''
Mr Rea, 79, a retired steel erector who has found himself cast in the
unlikely role of home-owners' champion, said he never doubted that he
would win.
''If it helps other people, then that will be very good. The reason I
took the case was not because of money, but mostly because I felt I was
being done. I felt I was being cheated and I was not willing to accept
that.
''I am under the impression that thousands of people are being
overcharged in the rating system, including a lot of my neighbours.
People should stand up for themselves.''
Mr Rea added: ''A lot of people round about here are in the same
circumstances. They are in band B or C when they should be in a group
lower. One of my daughters is in D group and I think she is being done,
but people just sit back and accept it.''
Mr Rea bought his council house in Househillmuir Crescent, Pollok, in
August 1991 when it was valued at #27,000. When the Strathclyde assessor
drew up the first list of valuations for the new council tax in April
1993, he placed Mr Rae's house in band B, the second lowest, at a value
of between #27,000 and #35,000.
Mr Rea contended that he should have been in band A, the cheapest, at
a value of #27,000 or less and, after the local valuation appeal
committee agreed with him, the assessor appealed to the Court of
Session.
The assessor argued that double glazing and extra radiators installed
by Mr Rea took his house over the #27,000 mark and that the property was
correctly placed in band B.
Lord Ross, the Lord Justice-Clerk, who heard the appeal with Lords
McCluskey and Morison, said the question of law raised by the case was
whether the valuation appeal committee was right to decide that the
double glazing and extra radiators should be left out of consideration.
The first valuation list had to be compiled by April 1, 1993, and the
legislation provided that the value of a house was to be based on what
it would have fetched had it been sold on the open market on April 1,
1991.
The assessor argued that the house must be valued in the condition it
was in on April 1, 1993, by which time it had been improved and would
have fetched more than #27,000 on the open market had it been sold in
1991.
The appeal committee, however, took the view that anything which did
not affect either the size or layout of the house, such as double
glazing and extra radiators, should not be taken into account. In that
case, the value of the house at April 1991 was less than #27,000, which
placed it in band A.
Lord Ross said the case was likely to have far-reaching implications.
The court had been informed that the approach taken by the assessor in
this case appeared to be shared by other assessors in Scotland and the
decision of the appeal committee in Strathclyde was at odds with other
appeal committees in Scotland.
Lord Ross said: ''I have come to the conclusion that the valuation
appeal committee's reasoning upon this matter cannot be faulted.''
The assessor had to value the house as if it were being valued on
April 1, 1991, and the council tax legislation provided that the size
and layout of a house must be assumed to be the same as at the time the
valuation was made.
He added: ''Thus, if between April 1, 1991, and April 1, 1993, the
subjects had been extended by the addition of a further room, it would
have to be assumed by the assessor that the extension existed on April
1, 1991.
''In the present case, however, there is no question of the size or
the layout of the dwelling being altered between April 1991 and April
1993.''
The assessor had expressly conceded that the installation of double
glazing or central heating radiators could not be regarded as matters of
size and layout.
Lord Ross added: ''It follows that, when the assessor makes the
necessary valuation, these improvements require to be left out of
account.''
The judges agreed that the valuation appeal committee had reached the
correct decision and refused the assessor's appeal.
Mr Rea was not represented by a lawyer in the Court of Session.
Although he was granted legal aid, the award was made subject to a
substantial financial contribution from Mr Rea himself which made it
impossible for him to take up the legal aid offer.
A spokesman for Strathclyde region said that, although this was a
specific case, it obviously had wider ramifications. The council's legal
department would be studying the decisions although it would be the new
unitary authorities that would be affected by any ramifications, he
said. He predicted that assessors from all the regional councils in
Scotland would have to meet and discuss the case at national level.
Under the legislation which brought in the council tax, there is no
provision for councils to carry out a general revaluation of any house.
It is only if a house changes hands that local authorities reassess its
value.
''Until the Secretary of State tells us otherwise, the present
valuation stands,'' said the region's spokesman.

Alexander Linklater looks at how far poetic standards have come since
the 1930s
THREE weeks ago the death of Stephen Spender severed the last major
link British poetry had with the big, politically-driven movements of
the 1930s. Spender made his name at a time when the conflict between
fascism and communism was nearing its zenith, idealism was pushing young
men of all classes to join the International Brigade in Spain, and many
believed the success of Franco would signal the beginning of world
collapse.
For poetry it was a time of reckoning. Lorca was murdered, Ezra Pound
was drifting to the political right, the modernism which George Orwell
despised remained dangerously noncommital: the challenges of literature
were inseparable from the great ideological clashes of the day. When
Hugh MacDiarmid addressed the fascist poet, Roy Campbell, and wrote:
You, Campbell, have done literature dirt / You have swindled the muse,
he wasn't talking about stylistic niceties. Roy Campbell's poetry was
filth because his politics were.
Today most writers, publishers, and editors agree that the role of
poetry has shifted dramatically. For New Generation poet, Simon
Armitage, there are no overarching issues: ''I once heard someone say
that the only thing which poetry and politics have in common is the
letter 'P'. I wouldn't go as far as that, but I tend to see politics as
just one subdivision.''
He believes the present situation demands that every poet continually
redefine what poetry is as he or she goes along.
The pattern of things at the moment is increasingly split and divided.
While the august towers of Faber &amp; Faber still stand firm, they have
long ceased to be at the centre of things. Publishers such as Cacarnet
and Bloodaxe are putting out a range of younger, stylistically more
diverse writers. The Poetry Society's 1994 selection of 20 ''New
Generation'' poets, many of whom are published by Bloodaxe, demonstrated
that a greater variety of regional and linguistic influences have been
coming to the fore.
But if the literary establishments and great debates of Spender's day
have been displaced, the new diversity of things is actually enlarging
the readership for poetry. Andrew McAllister, assistant editor of
Bloodaxe, is pleased with the way things are panning out: ''On the whole
we've done better year on year for the past 10 years. And we are
constantly increasing our staff.'' Their first editions often close to
3000 copies, more than most first novels.
But the newer publishers are themselves only part of a scene which has
stretched quite beyond traditional definitions of poetry. Coming from
the US, live poetry is increasingly making its mark. ''It's the
influence of the global village,'' McAllister explains.
''Internationally it's getting bigger. It comes from that mixture of
jazz, poetry, and rap. The influence of performance poetry has never
been so strong this century.''
For the past couple of years, the ICA in London has been making links
with the American performance scene, demonstrating that populist poetry
is on the rise. Clubs like the Kitchen and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in
New York are spreading their influence to London, bringing Latin and
Afro-Carribean styles to bear on what used to be just a
coffee-and-biscuits culture of poetry readings.
Competition ''Slam'' poetry and hip-hop sessions combine with more
text-based readings to tap a huge, previously ignored black audience. It
is the kind of development that Margaret Ritchie, events programmer at
Glasgow's CCA, would like to see more of in Scotland. After an
enormously successful poetry performance by John Giorno during Mayfest,
it is clear that the audiences are out there and ready for more. She is
now looking at ways to pick up on the new developments: ''I've seen
groups like Urban Poets Society and for me its a real eye-opener to
discover the London network.''
It is a question of mobilising people who would otherwise not step
into a bookshop. London promoter Tony Fairweather has used multi-media
events to blow the preconceptions of big publishers sky-high. Instead of
quiet, bookshop readings he puts on a show. Music and performance
combine with well-staged author interviews to make his promotions a real
night out for the audience.
When he suggested to Transworld that they stage Terry McMillan's
recent book, Disappearing Acts, in Brixton, they quailed at the idea. So
he went ahead anyway, using his own money, and 100 people had to be
turned away from the door. Then he went on to fill a 600-seat theatre in
Bloomsbury. The amount of books he is capable of selling at a promotion
is a revelation to the publishers he works with.
Fairweather's company, The Write Stuff, have discovered the combined
power of hitherto marginalised black communities and the use of strong,
well-organised performance. It's the idea behind what goes on at the
Literary Night Club in Brixton which is open to everything from jazz to
theatre to new live poetry. It is this end of the literary spectrum
which, through the broad medium of performance, sees poetry mingle with
novels, theatre, and music.
On a popular scale it is a serious challenge to rigid notions of what
poetry is and how it works.
But a popular challenge has its limitations. It can't enter the arena
of intellectual difficulty or take too many formal risks. So where is
the experimental underground? Is there a nineties avant-garde?
While publishers like Bloodaxe hold the middle ground and the
performance poets are working on the populist side of things, there is
also a network of experimental poets who are attempting to keep alive
the notion that poetry should push out towards the limits of human and
linguistic experience. It is this area where the commitment to poetry is
perhaps most passionate of all -- precisely because the audience for it
is small and funding scarce.
Again the influence is partly American, with the LANGUAGE poets
breaking up the poet's voice into verbal fragments, giving grammatical
structures the place of the first-person speaker. But the British
tradition is strong in its own right. Magazines with names like
Parataxis, Angel Exhaust, and AND are continuing a tradition of
modernist experiment.
Based in Glasgow, Object Permanence is the magazine which, for the
last couple of years, has been trying to assimilate both European and
American movements. But editors Peter Manson and Robin Purves dislike
being thought of as an ''interesting specialism'': ''OP has the widest
range of any poetry magazine,'' says Manson, whose work is strongly
influenced by the musical and performance experiments of John Cage.
''There's a fixed tradition which thinks it knows what poetry is. The
Cagean tradition doesn't want to define things as known and fixed. It
doesn't want to categorise. Anything can be performed from one modality
of art to another. You could perform a painting.''
Oddly enough this interest in the idea of breaking up categories in
the arts is what experimental poetry has in common with the New York
performers. It works on a very different level, appealing to a different
audiences, but it shows how far poetic standards have travelled since
the 1930s.

BURNING YOUR BOATS
Collected Short Stories
Angela Carter
Chatto &amp; Windus, #20
ANGELA CARTER is one of the very few writers whose books became
progressively better; and in his introduction to this volume of
Collected Short Stories, Salman Rushdie mourns the loss of creative
output as well as the life. ''She hadn't finished. Like Italo Calvino,
like Bruce Chatwin, like Raymond Carver, she died at the height of her
powers. For writers, these are the cruellest deaths: in mid-sentence, so
to speak. The stories in this volume are the measure of our loss. But
they are also our treasure, to savour and to hoard.''
The collection draws on four volumes of short stories, including some
early, experimental pieces and later uncollected work. Some are so
powerful that one cannot move on without stopping to digest what has
been read, or to try to deconstruct them, to take them apart and find
how they work. This is an interesting but eventually fruitless exercise,
for they seem to work like folk-tales, poised on the edge of our fears
and expectations exposing not just us, but humanity's foibles, fears,
and stupidities, praising us for being good, for doing the right thing,
warning of the consequences if we don't do as we should. And they have
some of the stock characters from folklore. Beasts are frequent
visitors, transformations and simple imaginative connections occur.
Angela Carter's main source of inspiration was fairy tales, myths, and
legends. Salman Rushdie describes her second story collection, The
Bloody Chamber, as her masterwork, and it's hard to disagree. Perhaps
''The Company of Wolves'', which Angela Carter adapted into film with
Neil Jordan, is the best-known story, but the title story is a superior,
novella-length reworking of Beauty and the Beast. It is all the classic
elements, including a lonely castle and a secret chamber, but Carter
makes two brilliant and dramatic changes which raise the story and
transform it completely.
Rather than Beauty sacrificing herself to save her father, she is
saved by her mother; and the fable is restored to its original status,
as a metaphor for sexual awareness and the dangers of sexual
relationships. This is told with a chilling brilliance, which is never
allowed to swamp the narrative, but serves to set the tone and unify the
collection.
It is misleading to suggest these haunting and deliberate stories are
simple reworkings of fairy-tales. They are far deeper, far more
disturbing, far more contemporary investigations that are almost always
driven by a moral curiosity. Angela Carter was obviously aware of and in
some ways relished her stance away from the main stream of literary
tradition, opting for a place which allowed linguistic and thematic
invention and provided the perfect position to launch an exploration
into modern desires.
She drew from a variety of sources, from ballads, and fantastic
narratives as well as fable, resurrecting these stories from the nursery
and restoring their origional intention, as metaphors and warnings, the
place where the Wolf means more to Red Riding Hood than someone who
disposes of her Granny. Baudelaire's black mistress, Jeanne Duval, Edgar
Allan Poe and, most marvellously of all, Lizzie Borden are real people
whose lives provide wonderful extensions of The Bloody Chamber, pieces
where atmosphere is developed to a point where the deed or even thought
is unnecessary. Angela Carter reworked her favourite stories and found
something fresh every time.
Marina Warner, who will deliver the inaugural Angela Carter lecture at
the Edinburgh Book Festival, has said: ''Her imagination was one of the
most dazzling this century''.
This is the first of three volumes of Collected Works. The Drama will
appear next year and the Collected Journalism will be published in July
1997. Though it's finite there is more to come and we owe these
anonymous editors our thanks.
* The Angela Carter Memorial Lecture will be given by Marina Warner at
the Edinburgh Book Festival on Sunday August 27 at 6.30pm.

FIGURES released by the Scottish Office on the growing number of
HIV/Aids victims among heterosexuals have led to a row between a leading
academic and one of Scotland's top Aids counsellors.
Professor Gordon Stewart, author of the latest report on Aids
spending, denied the statistics showed that the ''straight'' community
was at risk, adding that the figures caused needless fear.
But Mr Eric Kay, counsellor for HIV/Aids group Body Positive, insisted
the sudden rise proved once and for all that all groups were at risk
from the disease.
Professor Stewart said: ''I would certainly say don't panic because
this is no epidemic. There is an increase among people engaged in
high-risk behaviour, but not that many.''
His remarks follow new statistics showing a 66% increase in the number
of Scots with HIV/Aids caused by heterosexual intercourse.
However, Mr Kay, whose group was officially opened yesterday by
actress and comedienne Elaine C Smith, said: ''To say the rise among
heterosexuals is not a worry is dangerous mis-information.
''There is definitely an increase, no question of it, and not just
among the high-risk groups. Some of our members with the illness could
not be categorised under this umbrella term.''
High-risk groups apart from homosexuals include intravenous drug
users, those who have slept with a foreign HIV carrier, and bisexuals.
According to Professor Stewart, a total of 680 Scots were registered
with the virus by June this year. Of that total, 322 lived in Edinburgh,
with Glasgow and Tayside the next largest catchment areas.
Most cases, he reported, were among drug users who contract the
disease through shared needles.
''The man responsible for discovering the virus, Luc Montagnier, even
said himself that there was no Aids epidemic in Northern Europe,'' said
Professor Stewart.
Scottish Office figures show 35 heterosexuals contracted HIV within
the first six months of this year, compared to 33 for the whole of last
year.

THE laugh that accompanies the statement, ''It's a great life for
Dilettante!'', suggests it was either a joke or wishful thinking. If
ever the life of a literary agent was one of casual dabbling -- albeit
in a gentlemanly fashion -- that time has long gone. And Giles Gordon --
one of the country's top agents -- knows that for sure.
Agents are like mediums. Authors arrive with hopeful manuscripts,
expecting agents to make meaningful contact with the commercial side of
things. Time was that a first cry of ''Is there anybody there . . .?''
would have brought all kinds of possibilities winging to the table.
Promising new talent was on a par with endowment mortgages -- it might
cost a bit at the start but long-term benefits were assured . . . not
any more, though. The market has rudely shifted.
''You just can't find publishers for new work'' says Gordon. ''And
it's not a question of talent. I've sent out four first novels recently.
And the rejection slips have all said 'Wonderful book. Great writing.
But . . .' And the 'but' is, that they couldn't see themselves selling
enough copies to justify the expense of publishing.''
Two or three years ago things were different. The interest was real,
backed up by hard cash. ''Modest advances, usually'' adds Gordon, ''but
it argued a certain commitment to the writer. Nobody now is handing out
even that much.''
It's at this point that the agent finds he is the filling in an
awkward sandwich. He has the eager, anxious author on one side, looking
for results and a ''sorry but you know how it is'' publisher saying no
on the other.
As the refusals mount and disillusion creeps in on the unpublished
writer, so the agent -- once looked on as an ally and trusty guide -- is
suspected of incompetence, laziness, spite.
''The agent gets blamed for the incompetence of the conglomerates''
says Gordon dryly.
''It's cutbacks again. Publishers have sacked so many of their editors
that now agents have to provide the editorial services. It's quite a
change of emphasis. And it's made the job much more difficult than it
was 10 years ago. Then, an agent was a business person, setting up
connections, getting the best possible deal for the authors he
represented. Now the agent has to act as editor as well. The onus is on
him to pull a book into shape. And yes -- you'll probably get accused of
messing it up if the publishers don't go for it!''
He names no names, but admits that some of the 80 authors on his books
can be very demanding, very draining, especially when things aren't
going according to their personal plan of critical and financial
success.
''Sometimes you end up wishing you were a lawyer. Then you could send
out a bill for #5000, for all the time you've spent with people whether
you've won or not. Instead of being an agent living on 10% cent of
nothing!''
Despite all this he retains a somewhat romantic attachment to the job.
No sooner has he sketched in the colours of a day spent communicating
rejections to those who really do deserve better, than he's commenting
with glee that ''CD-Roms are doing appallingly, you know. I'm totally
optimistic. The book has a great future!''
What does get to him, however, is the cynicism that he sees spreading
through the book trade. He tells of an American publisher who didn't
want to know about a writer until he'd made his mark on the market. ''He
wanted someone else to take the early risks. He'd 'pick up on the guy
when he's famous'. That sort of cynicism is now rampant, I'm afraid.''
As an act of positive encouragement, however, Giles Gordon is taking
part in the Edinburgh Book Festival's series of How to? Throughout the
Festival, various practitioners -- writers in different gendre, editors,
agents and publishers -- will talk, from their own experiences, about
how to get work into print, or on air.
Gordon -- in tandem with editor/publisher Geraldine Cook -- will
tender advice on how to get noticed. No doubt the wisdom will be spiced
with his customary wit.
* Giles Gordon appears at the Edinburgh Book Festival on August 24 at
3pm.

Africa and Italy during the Second World War, achieving the rank of
major, and led the Princes Street victory parade in Edinburgh.
After the war, he joined the stockbroking firm of John Robertson and
was senior partner by the time of its amalgamation with Bell Cowan and
Company. He was chairman of the Stock Exchange in Edinburgh from 1968 to
1970 and the Stock Exchange in Scotland in 1972-73.
In 1974, he started the Edinburgh office of Parsons &amp; Company, later
part of the large Glasgow-based stockbrokers Allied Provincial Parsons
Penney, from which he retired in 1987.
A keen squash player and golfer, he joined the SRU in 1956 and served
as president in season 1967-68.
Mr Tod, whose wife Muriel died on June 9, is survived by his four
children.

KEITH SINCLAIR'S article covers a dispute between the National Trust
for Scotland (NTS) and the Wright brothers, former owners of Arduaine
garden, that has been on the go for several years (August 7). I have
been familiar with the garden for many years, and regard it as the
finest garden of its type in the United Kingdom.
Arduaine garden was originally planted by Arthur Campbell, but from
about 1960 it had fallen into neglect, and was only restored and
augmented by the devoted labours of Harry and Ed Wright, two retired
English nurserymen who bought the abandoned relic and spent the next 21
years not simply restoring it but raising it to the level of the finest
private garden in the West of Scotland.
As they grew older they became concerned about their ability to
maintain the garden properly, and, seeking to ensure its long-term
survival, they refused a number of attractive offers from private
individuals and donated the garden to the NTS. At the time the gift was
made, the garden was in perfect condition as a result of the labours of
the Wrights.
Unfortunately after the gift was made relations between the donors and
the NTS have rapidly deteriorated, as has the condition of the garden. I
presume because their background was commercial rather than landed
gentry, the Wrights have never been entirely acceptable to the NTS,
whose committees largely represent the landed gentry and petty
bourgeoisie.
As a result the NTS's treatment of the Wrights has ranged from
cavalier to downright shabby. A little consideration of the people who
had made a valuable and generous donation to the NTS would have avoided
much of the present friction.
Surely they should at least have been consulted over the appointment
of the head gardener, on whom so much responsibility was to devolve. As
it is, due to the gardener's lack of understanding of the effort needed
to maintain such a property, the garden is now in a perilous state.
The NTS's statement reported by Keith Sinclair does not suggest any
mellowing of their attitude to the Wrights whose requirement seem to me
to be modest and appropriate -- that the garden should be managed by a
local committee, with experience of the conditions in West Argyll, and
the inappropriate gardener be replaced by someone acceptable to the
Wrights.
I hope you will continue to cover this story.

RELATIVE to your article, Strife in Argyll's little Eden (August 7), I
have been in constant touch with the National Trust for Scotland's
director on ''the Arduaine saga''.
I wrote recently regarding the method of applying fertiliser
indiscriminately over shrubs and plants. The granules were adhering to
the small plants, primulas, etc.
According to the director it was applied with the agreement of the
Arduaine local advisory committee. Not so, says a member of that
committee.
I also raised the matter of a shredder, costing many hundreds of
pounds, which had lain outside unused for some 14 months. This was
denied but I pointed out that last autumn's leaves were still in the
chute and it was impossible for the machine to have been used.
The house built by the NTS for the property manager/head gardener is
to my mind a monstrosity and the area around it leaves so much to be
desired. I would dearly love to know what it cost.
I also pointed out that the staff seem to concentrate their efforts
around the entrance and as you progress into the garden the neglect
becomes more apparent. I am told that there are three zones of
management: the formal area is maintained to the highest standard, the
cliff area less so, and the woodland area in a more formal way, but
there should be no signs of neglect.
I have seen a deterioration in standards in the time I have visited
the garden.
Where is the public acclaim? I would like to see this in print. I
would agree with Edmund and Harry Wright that they have been badly
treated by the NTS and it is past and present employees of the NTS who
have caused the problems.
The brothers may have no legal right in saying how the garden should
be administered but surely they have a moral right to say how it is
managed as donors of the property.
This saga will deter others from donating their property to the NTS if
this is how they are to be treated.

THE article, Strife in Argyll's little Eden, hides more truth than it
exposes (August 7), although such publicity embarrasses the National
Trust for Scotland which claims ''Arduaine is, and will continue to be,
maintained to the highest possible standard,'' a promise made in 1992.
In a recent letter the NTS chairman says in reply to our criticism
that the deputy director ''has asked Duncan Donald (the head of gardens)
to visit Arduaine as a matter of urgency to develop our work
programme''.
Why the urgency if the highest possible standards already exist?
John Basford, 34 years with the NTS and still involved, dares not
voice his private opinion. Horticulturists do notice the ''problems'' in
the garden and do complain. Branklyn garden suffered its catastrophic
decline because no-one noticed what was happening until too late. The
collection of rare plants there has been lost.
In August 1994 the NTS representative wrote to a visitor: ''I
acknowledge overgrown areas and ferns growing where they should not.
There is no excuse for this and we are looking to improve areas of the
garden. The progress is much slower than I had hoped.'' Recent reports
indicate such progress has yet to be achieved.
We are accused of ''unjustified animosity'' towards a gardener who is
allowing the same deterioration here that occurred at Branklyn.
One member of the appointments committee now agrees that three of
those on the short list of six were only present for appearance's sake
-- these remarks were recorded on tape and also in the minutes of an
advisory committee meeting.
Are our worries over such matters and irregularities unjustified, as
the NTS claims?

AS a member of the National Party/SNP for some 65 years, I must agree
with much of that expressed by John Macleod (August 8).
Back in the mid-thirties we did not speak of left-wing, right-wing, or
centre, preferring to leave these matters to the Scottish football
selectors.
But we were indeed a national party with dukes, shop stewards, small
to medium-sized business men, not to speak of well-known authors and
poets. Duncan Macrae, for instance spoke for Robert Macintyre when he
won Motherwell in 1945.
Let us then get back to presenting our message to all the Scottish
people.
As far as the Socialists are concerned, I recall the immortal words of
the then Scottish Secretary, Willie Ross, who declared that he would
resign if Scottish unemployment exceeded 100,000.
In the event he chose instead to enter the House of Lords.

MATTHEW SMITH claims that independence will plunge us into economic
ruin (August 8).
As usual he provides no analytical proof for his lack of confidence in
the Scots' ability to manage their economy.
Indeed the history of northern Europe in this century shows that small
nations which have gained their independence have prospered thereafter,
often outstripping the economic performance of the rump of their former
state.
Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Eire are all examples. The first three
enjoy a higher standard of living than we do, and Eire is on course to
overtake the UK per capita income within a generation.
It is time for Unionists to answer this simple question: if these
small European countries can succeed economically with independence why
can't Scotland?

YOUR correspondent, Mr A B Robertson of Dunoon, has twice now alleged
that in the devolution referendum I ''did a complete volte face'' on the
issue. He now demands that I make a public statement on the matter.
He might as well demand that I make a public statement on an assertion
that in 1979 I ate purple cheese. His tiresome letters bear no relation
to reality.
In spite of my reservations about Labour's scheme, we formed an
all-party ''yes'' committee in the Borders and I spoke at several
referendum meetings, at least one of which was with the late John Smith.
I am glad that today's Constitutional Convention scheme is altogether
better thought out and likely to command greater public enthusiasm than
the 1979 version.

INCREASINGLY most large public-sector employers, educational
establishments, and major multinational companies claim that they
operate, or are striving towards, equal opportunities in making
appointments.
Regrettably the evidence in support of these claims is largely
groundless and several recent major public appointments clearly indicate
that there is a lack of impartiality in the appointment of senior public
figures.
This observation has been strengthened by the decision of the new City
of Glasgow District Council to ''create'' a position of some prominence,
on the new unitary authority, for Mr Frank Pignatelli, the current
director of education for Strathclyde region.
Creating appointments has begun to gain considerable popularity,
particularly in a number of prestigious institutions. Within the Glasgow
area the new City of Glasgow District Council finds itself in good
company with the University of Glasgow which in May created a position
for the wife of its Principal-designate.
There are many aspects of these appointments procedures that are
difficult to reconcile and indeed fall far short of the criteria that
are supposed to be stringently applied in selecting and ultimately
appointing successful candidates.
The new City of Glasgow unitary authority may counter that Mr
Pignatelli was a logical choice of candidate since he has been at the
forefront of educational development in Strathclyde for some
considerable period of time and therefore would be able to ease the
cumbersome transition from former regional to new district authority.
To be blunt that would be a nebulous and hollow stance to adopt since
Mr Pignatelli did not run the education department single-handedly and,
without question, there would have been equally well-qualified
candidates who, if given the opportunity, would be able to fulfil this
role within the new authority.
It is extemely ill-timed that the announcement of Mr Pignatelli's
appointment should be made at this point in time. A strong sense of
uncertainty pervades the entire Scottish local government arena at this
time and many public-sector employees live under the constant threat of
impending departmental contraction and eventual redundancy.
In some instances present local government employees may find
themselves in the unenviable position of having to re-apply for their
existing position when the new unitary councils come into being.
For Mr Pignatelli to be cushioned in such a manner is unacceptable and
smacks of the ''jobs for the boys'' scenario that the equal
opportunities monitoring programmes were supposed to prevent.

I WAS most interested to read the letter from the Rev J C G Greig on
mutual recognition of ministries (August 1).
I have been a Christian most of my life and had my most interesting
experiences while serving in HM Forces where Christians were placed in
three groupings -- Church of England, Roman Catholic, or Free Church.
As a Church of Scotland member I was classed as Free Church along with
Methodists, Baptists, Evangelists, and Brethren. We enjoyed wonderful
fellowship with each other, services being conducted by ministers of
several denominations in a way which made all of us feel equal parts of
the family of Christ.
However, in most cases attempts to include Church of England members
in our non-denominational services was met by a cold shoulder.

THE French train drivers' strike reminds me of a letter you were good
enough to publish in September 1984.
In the context of the road versus rail controversy I pointed out that
the choice was not between similar services but between ''an
unconditional facility and a conditional service,'' since ''everyone is
free to use the roads whenever they want to, whereas the railway system
may only be used by courtesy of the unions concerned''.
I had assumed that the management of the Channel Tunnel, considering
the immense capital invested in it, would have protected itself against
this kind of vandalism.
It seems I was wrong.

TELEPHONES are wonderful things. We have four of them dotted around
the house, including a cordless one which can be answered in the bath.
However, it must be said that when people on the other end of the
telephone detect that they are being spoken to by a naked man immersed
in water (presumably the splashing sounds give me away), they don't seem
very pleased. I shall deal with the etiquette of this situation in a
moment, but meanwhile let me continue extolling the virtues of the
telephone.
This article is being brought to you by telephone line, whizzing
straight from my laptop computer into The Herald's giant databank from
which it is printed.
The humble telephone itself has undergone amazing changes in the past
decade. Tone dialling, number memory, and last-number redial are now
standard, not optional luxuries, on most phones. Prices have tumbled for
cellular phones which enable the owner to keep in touch with the office
from the golf course.
Adjuncts to the telephone include the fax and the answering machine.
The latter can now be purchased for as little as #25 (I remember paying
#185 a decade ago) and I would seriously argue that they should be
standard equipment for many areas of employment (including clergymen).
However, there must be a snag to all this telephonic euphoria -- and
there is. The humans who use them.
The technology is not the problem, it is the way it is used. The
etiquette of telephone technique is a much neglected area. There are
businesses which take the trouble (God bless them) to train their
operators and receptionists. Some are just naturally superb at handling
calls. Others make out as if they have got out of bed on the wrong side
and deeply resent having had to get up in the first place. A telephonist
can bankrupt a company by rude or lazy work, turning away potential
customers, or keeping callers waiting without explanation.
The simple question ''Who's calling?'' can be rendered by a gruff
Glaswegian telephonist as if she really wanted to say ''And who are you
anyway?'' Tone of voice is all-important on the telephone. For a while a
building firm I had occasion to call had taught the operators to say
''Good morning. It's a sunny day at . . . Homes! Samantha speaking, how
can I help you?'' The trouble was she said it like a robot with a
hangover, and had the opposite effect to the feel-good factor.
My own pet hate is children who answer the phone. With some
exceptions, one being the four-year-old son of friends who recently did
a junior Jeeves impersonation when I called, I dread getting the child
of the house. Since you are neither one of their pals or a Power Ranger,
they are not interested and will go off in a desultory way after asking
who is calling, leaving you wondering whether they will bother to pass
on the message. Minutes later a breathless parent will arrive at the
phone saying ''Hello?!'' in such a way that it is obvious the brat has
not bothered to say who was calling.
Another irritating facet of children and phones is when the children
wail or talk to the parent during your call and it becomes patently
obvious that the child is receiving more attention than your call.
Rudest of all is the wrong number who abruptly hangs up without apology
when he finds you are not who he wants you to be. I once answered the
phone to such a boor 10 minutes after the bells on New Year and he
didn't even wish me a Happy New Year.
Having said all this, I am guilty along with many others of a common
breach of etiquette. We phone someone when it is convenient for us and
often do not take the trouble to find if it is convenient for them to
speak at that moment. We even go further by expecting that our call
ought to be taken right away. The proof of this is the slight we imagine
has been done to us if the person says ''I'm sorry but I'm in the middle
of lunch. Can you call back in 15 minutes?'' Call back? Can he not call
us, we miff, forgetting that we were the ones who initiated the
intrusion.
Have you ever had an important appointment and then had it interrupted
while the person you have been waiting to see takes calls from people
who have no appointment? Or been to a dinner party from which the host
disappears to answer phone calls in the middle of the meal? It is hard
to know who is the more put upon -- the ''honoured'' guest or the
put-upon host.
Good telephone etiquette is to put on the trusty answering machine and
deal with calls when both appointment and dinner are over. Why do we
assume we have a right to speak to someone immediately on the phone when
we would never dream of asserting this ''right'' by turning up on their
doorstep?
Do you have a pet hate among breaches of telephone etiquette? Perhaps
it is the mountebank who walks up and down the departure lounge or
railway platform, talking in a loud voice into his mobile phone.
Personally, I think there should be No Phone areas in restaurants along
with No Smoking ones.
However, there is another threat to the growth of telephone etiquette
-- the automatic switchboard: ''You are in a queue of calls. If you have
a touch-tone telephone, press 1 for customer service, 2 for sales, 3 to
leave a message.'' Call me old fashioned, but I still prefer telephones
which connect me to people.

YOUR report about Mr Allan Sharpe, of Newbridge, and his attitude to
NHS prescriptions and their charges is poorly researched, or maybe it is
simply that my professional knowledge recognised it as garbage (August
4).
For example, Calpol infant suspension -- for a child, therefore free
from NHS charges; Benylin has not been allowed on the NHS for years;
Nurofen (spelling wrong) again is not allowed, and this also applies to
most multivitamin combination products.
There are two types of drugs which can be supplied on prescription.
First, those which can be sold legally over the counter. Most
pharmacists will advise the patient accordingly and the patient can then
purchase at the current retail price if that is below the current NHS
charge of #5.25.
By far the greater amount of prescription drugs can only be supplied
on a written prescription from a doctor and that prescription can either
be on an NHS form or as a private prescription on the doctors' practice
notepaper.
Mr Sharpe believes that he has the right to receive an NHS
prescription form and make up his own mind, depending on the price of
the drug, to treat it either way. Family health authorities in England
and health boards in Scotland maintain that an NHS form is their
property and that the pharmacists cannot pick and choose what course of
action to take.
The cost of prescription drugs is a matter of swings and roundabouts.
In the last few years I have supplied prescriptions which have cost a
few pence and others of over #1000.

THE Scottish male labour force is forecast to decline over the next
decade by a factor larger than that in any other area of the United
Kingdom. Stripped out of the bald figures, what does this mean? To begin
with, as any student learns, we must define our terms, and these will
surprise some people. When officialdom talks of the economically active
labour force it does not just mean those fortunate enough to be in work
or self-employed. It includes the unemployed. The only people not
included are the old, the young, and the discouraged, which is the group
of workers who would like to work but who have been unable to find
suitable employment. Therefore, when we are told that the labour force
will decline we should be fairly worried, for our entire pool of workers
is involved. But why, specifically, should we worry? After all, there
are plenty of people willing to argue that because the labour force goes
down the problem of unemployment will ease because there will be fewer
people chasing the available jobs. This is a perverse and economically
unhelpful way of looking at the problem. The core of the crisis facing
Scotland over the next few years is that people will go where jobs can
be found, and if the figures are correct this will be almost anywhere
else in the UK apart from Scotland. The Government's own statistics from
the official Employment Gazette show that the labour force in East
Anglia, Britain's smallest region, is forecast to grow by 13% over the
same period. This is partly because of the outward drift from London,
but more importantly because East Anglia presents itself as a vibrant
economic region with plenty of indigenous and expanding business
enterprises and opportunities.
In Scotland, without in any sense attempting to talk down our own
business environment, we have some evidence of the opposite effect.
Hundreds of skilled Scottish aerospace workers are contemplating moving
to Toulouse because their future prospects are there rather than in
Scotland. Much the same applies with Rolls-Royce in East Kilbride. The
lack of centres of growth and decision making in Scotland feeds into
this as well. Scottish Nuclear can hardly, despite PR persuasion, be
described as a Scottish-controlled company any more. Other Scottish
companies see their growth potential elsewhere, as in the Scottish and
Newcastle and Courage situation and in ScottishPower's attempt to absorb
Manweb. This is most emphatically not a political point. It is a simple
fact that people are drawn to economic activity which has autonomous
power and which is perceived as being capable of sustaining both its
independence and growth potential. In fact the statistics show that
Scottish economic activity is likely to hold up fairly well. The
problem, and it must be repeated, is that people are likely to have to
go elsewhere for work.
It is not easy to propose solutions for this sort of situation. After
all, demography is a very inexact science. Anyone who doubts this should
examine the rise and fall in school rolls over the years and the
distressingly small number of occasions in which planners using
demographic models have managed to match school places to pupils. For
this reason, among others, the successors to Strathclyde region will
have to close a good number of schools in coming years. It seems the
secret of overcoming the threats of demography lies in transforming
Scotland into a vibrant and attractive area of economic activity. Two
things are needed if this recipe is to work. The first is an active role
by Government in providing the sort of infrastructure in which
businesses can be established and then grow. This, as Mr Heseltine
appreciates only too well, involves a sensible measure of intervention
by Government with the aim of bringing together locations and
opportunities. It involves, in addition, a greater emphasis on a
well-trained workforce. The second is that the rate of investment by
companies in Scotland must grow much faster than it has done in recent
times. In a sense Scottish companies must ignore the demographic
arguments which have been presented and seize the opportunity to go
forward in faith. If they do this seriously and with long-term
commitment we remain confident that their faith will be rewarded.

THE latest developments in the Balkans appear, as President Clinton
said, to have created ''a moment of real promise'' for renewed peace
efforts. The important thing is that the basis for these efforts is
agreed among the five members of the Contact Group. Both President
Clinton and President Yeltsin, who have much to gain at home from
emerging as, if not the sole, at least the leading peacemaker, launched
their own peace initiatives this week. The danger is that the
international unity which has prevailed would be seriously damaged if
either went it alone, something the warring factions in the former
Yugoslavia would be swift to exploit. The danger has been recognised,
hence the tour of the Contact Group countries by President Clinton's
National Security Adviser, Mr Anthony Lake. Having secured the backing
of London, Paris, and Bonn, he is to have talks tomorrow in the Black
Sea resort of Sochi with the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, to try to find common ground between the two initiatives. It is
in everyone's interests they succeed.
President Yeltsin's proposal, launched earlier this week, for a summit
of the leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia to lay the groundwork for
an international peace conference was not received as well as he had
hoped. Only his acolyte, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, turned
up in Moscow to discuss the idea, the other Balkan leaders staying away,
while the Contact Group proved lukewarm about it.
Britain, Germany, and France have lined up behind the American scheme,
which apparently involves yet another redrawing of the map rejected by
the Bosnian Serbs last year taking recent changes on the ground into
account. It is vital this revised territorial carve-up should not leave
Bosnia's Muslims, the likely largest losers, believing they have lost
out, hence the decision by the Prime Minister to send the Armed Forces
Minister, Mr Nicholas Soames, off tomorrow with a personal message to
the governments of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Morocco. This is
intended to avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings about what is
planned and to persuade them Britain, seen as one of the leading
opponents of military aid to Bosnia, has the interests of the Bosnian
Muslims at heart. The Russians, anxious to combine the two plans, were
arguing yesterday that they were complementary rather than mutually
exclusive. Let us hope this proves the case, because what is agreed
might stand a chance of success, although the redrawing of maps is
always a thankless business which stores up trouble for the future.
Russian sources were insisting yesterday that no plans were being
nurtured with the Americans to partition Bosnia, but there will be
winners and losers in any settlement, and it is how it is explained that
matters.
President Yeltsin wants sanctions against Serbia lifted and has hinted
he might go it alone, but that looks more like making noises to placate
domestic pressure from Russia's huge pro-Serb lobby. President Clinton's
decision to veto the lifting by Congress of the arms embargo against
Bosnia should help. There are dangers, but there are grounds for faint
hopes for peace.

There really is no celtic conspiracy to undermine the literary
establishment, it's just that Scottish writers are changing the face of
modern literature, finds Alexander Linklater.
SINCE the early eighties the question of what is new in British
fiction has been repeated with weary regularity. The energy created by
belatedly importing the genius of Latin American literature, and the
solace which first and second generation immigrant writers brought to
the London scene, temporarily papered over a generally recognised slump
in home-grown talent. When, in 1993, Granta magazine published its
second list of supposedly exciting young British novelists the response
came like the slow clap of an audience itching to get out of the
theatre.
''There is a little magic realism, some novels in dialect and
nineteenth-century pastiche novels about invented texts and novels which
end in playscripts -- but it doesn't really matter. Anybody can do
anything: and besides, anything has already been done,'' was the seal of
indolent establishment gloom which James Wood set in in the Guardian.
This isn't, of course, entirely accurate. Among others Candia
McWilliam, Iain Banks, Alan Hollinghurst, Jeanette Winterson, Ben Okri,
and Tibor Fischer are still mentioned with enthusiasm by publishers. But
Wood did have a point. As a group the writers on this list fell a long
way short of forming an inspired wave of innovative fiction. Will Self
is the one most widely referred to in the London press as being on the
cutting edge. And if the cruel, vapid, arrogant literary tinkering of
his Cock and Bull really is at the forefront then the carcass of British
fiction is truly rotten.
So, has anything happened since Granta's Best of Young British? Or is
the conclusion still that there are a few reasonably good writers out
there, but no exciting new movements; some random exceptions to a
largely mediocre scene?
As it turns out there is an astonishing consensus among publishers at
the moment that this is not the case. But to understand what is going on
it is necessary to look beyond the fudged compromises of the Granta
list. There is, even if only temporarily, a more specific focus.
Some call it a passing fad, others perceive in it much deeper roots,
but the majority are agreed that recent Scottish writing is doing more
than raising the odd English eyebrow and winning the occasional literary
prize. Duncan McLean, A L Kennedy, Alan Warner, Irvine Welsh, Janice
Galloway, Jeff Torrington: these are the names currently dictating
British literary fashion. Whether for or against, publishers see them as
the clearest frame of reference in debates about new fiction.
Johnny Geller, an agent at Curtis Brown in London, makes the familiar
point that English literature is suffering from the stifling influences
of its own canon. ''In the past internalised narratives have held sway.
People our age do not want those oblique literary games any more, they
want a strong story. I am looking for writers with control, a sustained
voice, and within that the building up of characters.''
Across the board, publishers are looking for the strong, isolated
voices to sustain them during the fiction slump. Marion Sinclair,
editorial director of Polygon, says that bigger publishers have looked
to them for ideas precisely because they have managed to pick up the
less conventional writers. Jamie Byng is someone else with his eye on
changing styles. At Canongate he has set up a new press -- Payback -- in
search of ''counter-cultural, politically charged writing which can
explain what it means to be young and live in the vicious society''. For
him contemporary Scottish writing, in its capacity to articulate
disempowered voices, has opened the way for such opportunities.
Even where they are disliked there is general agreement as to what it
is that defines these developments: it is the visceral edge of the
Scottish writers, their ability to speak of violence without censoring
or glamorising, and the treatment of sex and gender in a style that
doesn't get drawn into platitudinous debates about political
correctness. And this has found its critics.
Pat Kane, keen to apply the same derisory tactics he uses against new
British pop, targeted his other ''thugs-elect'' in Scotland on Sunday
two weeks ago. He claims that Welsh and McLean represent a breed of
''New Bastard'', celebrating chic-violence and riding a wave of male
agression exemplified in cinema by Quentin Tarantino and the makers of
Shallow Grave.
For Robin Robertson, editorial director at Jonathan Cape, this kind of
response is merely fatuous, as is the suggestion that a limited,
anti-intellectual streak is being exploited. It ignores the richness and
diversity of the Scottish writers, the vital and highly individuated
styles they are developing and, ultimately, their importance to new
fiction. ''Duncan McLean is just Dostoevsky. Scottish writing this
century has consistently reached outwards. These critics haven't read
the classics, and they don't know how to read the contemporary writers
either.''
Robertson is the man responsible for mobilising the new Scottish work.
First at Secker and Warburg, and now at Jonathan Cape, he has
accumulated the single most enviable body of current and important
fiction in British publishing. But there has been no nationalistic zeal
in his work. He is just as excited by English writers he is promoting,
such as John King, as he is by the Scots. It just so happens that
Scottish work dominates.
Nor are the writers themselves purporting to form some kind of northen
solidarity. Irvine Welsh, for example, feels as much influence from
England and the US as he does from home territory. But the backbone of
Robertson's work happens to be James Kelman, and therein lies a story.
When Kelman won the Booker Prize last year certain denizens of the
English establishment made some very curious noises. There were the
moronic complaints about four-letter words in How Late it Was, How Late,
the balefully out-of-date bickering over the ''difficulty'' of Kelman's
language, and some ghoulishly surreal column-inches given over to the
fact that he didn't wear a tie to the awards ceremony.
All of which obscured some basic and vital details. Here is a writer
who believes in the novel, has faith in its social function, and whose
formal originality springs from hard-won conviction rather than literary
playfulness. Everything, in fact, that is supposed to be lacking in our
fiction.
It would be missing the mark to describe the younger Scottish writers
as forming part of a Kelman-led movement. But they have personal
associations in common as well as sharing those convictions about the
possibilities of fiction. When the establishment begins to itch itself,
as it did over How Late it Was, How Late, something interesting is
almost certainly happening.

William Dunbar v Bishop Kennedy of St Andrews
* WILLIAM Dunbar and Bishop Kennedy of St Andrews were the David
Baddiel and Rob Newman of the fifteenth century. Then flyting -- poetry
as poisoned darts -- was the all-in wrestling of the day and both were
Big Daddies.
The academic Tom Scott described The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy as
''the most repellent poem known to me in any language -- a penance to
read and write about''. It is easy to see why. Dunbar may have said he
despised flyting as unworthy of a poet but he wasted little time
launching an attack on Kennedy, who had pushed him into the literary
duel.
The Bishop is described as both syphilitic and gonorrhoeal. Dunbar
insisted that Kennedy's appearance was leprous and frightened people. In
Edinburgh, he said, schools will be emptied so that small children can
hound him down, women will take in washing at the sight of him, and
fishwives will pelt him with offal. If Kennedy did not surrender Dunbar
would kill him.
Attack is the best form of defence and so Kennedy began with Dunbar's
good name. ''Dunbar'', he insisted, is really ''Dewlbeir'', meaning born
of a devil upon a she-bear. Also that Dunbar's ancestor was Corspatrick
who betrayed his country to Edward I and that Dunbar must acknowledge
him king and cower or he will be burned alive. As if that was not
enough, Dunbar was said to drink frog-spawn.
In Tom Scott's opinion Kennedy ''clearly defeated Dunbar'' but is the
''more disgraced by the more disgraceful performance''.

BOOKS are one of the most accessible and ''money friendly'' subjects
for collecting. Second-hand stalls and bookshops abound and bargains can
be found by the sharp eyed in car boot sales and charity shops.
Most people begin collecting authors they admire or books on subjects
in which they are interested, but before they know where they are they
are in deep and looking for first editions.
Everyone knows that a ''first edition'' is more valuable than any
subsequent edition, but the beginner in book collecting is confused and
asks the question: ''How can you tell if a book is a first edition or
not?''
The answer is a book is a first edition when there is no evidence on
it to the contrary. Subsequent editions are always marked as such; first
editions are not. Every time there is a new setting of type, a new
edition is created. If, however, a book is issued in batches or
impressions without the type being re-set, the initial printing is
called the first ''impression''. Sometimes subsequent impressions give
themselves away by carrying on the title pages, ''first printed... (and
a date)''.
Just to muddy the water, we also have the question of first and
subsequent ''issues'', in which, after some copies of the first edition
have been printed, alterations have been made. These are often hard to
spot but this usually happens in the case of antiquarian books.
If all this is already confusing you, it will be worth your while to
invest in a copy of Understanding Book Collecting by the late Grant
Uden, which is published by the Antique Collectors' Club at #19.95. This
book first appeared in 1982, was re-printed in 1983, 1992 and 1995.
Understanding Book Collecting mainly concentrates on the more esoteric
and expensive areas of the market -- rare books, very old books, Bibles
and manuscripts, and books with special binding but Mr Uden has
thoughtfully provided a glossary which demystifies the words found in
book sellers' catalogues.
Not surprisingly, book collectors are pernickety users of language. In
their jargon a ''book ticket'' is a small form of a bookplate, usually
just with the owner's name; ''disbound'' applies to pamphlets or
booklets taken out of bound collections, whereas ''unbound'' means that
the publication in question was issued without covers in the first
place; ''rubricated'' means that the initial capitals for paragraphs are
painted in red, whereas ''ruled in red'' means that the book has
underlinings on the title page in red.
One term that is frequently misunderstood is ''uncut'' which does not
mean unopened, but does mean that the edges of the pages have not been
trimmed off by the printer's guillotine.
Other additions in the book are a chapter on how to read Roman
numerals and another giving a list of antiquarian book dealers all over
the country.
Many people are interested in collecting modern first editions and
there are some spectacular profits to be made in this field. Best prices
are paid for signed and dedicated first editions by well-known authors,
who come and go out of fashion depending on how often their books appear
on the market.
Marie Helene Oliver, a specialist in Christie's South Kensington book
department, says that ''astonishing'' prices are currently being paid
for Ian Fleming's works. Signed first editions of the Bond books go for
more than #1000, but recently a copy of The Spy Who Loved Me with a
personal inscription as well as a signature, made #5000.
She advises book buyers that when they buy a hard-back first edition
of any new book, to take it along to an author signing session and get a
dedication made out to them on its fly leaf. You never know who is going
to be collectable one day. Miss Oliver also suggests that bibliophiles
with an eye to the future should invest in Booker prize winners -- but
always try to get them signed, keep them in good condition and preserve
the wrappers.
In the twentieth century second-hand market, authors to look out for
are P G Wodehouse and Agatha Christie (but only their earlier works
which were not printed in enormous quantities); John Le Carre, Graham
Greene, and Conan Doyle.
The next book sale to be held by a Scottish auction house will be in
Glasgow at Phillips' Bath Street rooms on August 16.

With society in the grip of an electronic era, Joe Donnelly assesses
if the written book can subsist.
IS THE book dead? Has electronics killed the book? The question was
posed, possibly because this writer has a foot in both camps. The
Herald's Weekender Cutting Edge section allegedly makes me the office
know-all about things new and gadgety and scientific.
The fact that book writing contributes generously to my ever
upwardly-spiralling cost of living makes me a staunch supporter and
devout devotee of the printed word. I've a vested interest.
So, is the book dead? This writer is up the creek if they're preparing
a grave for the novel. Sans pas d'elle. Having said that, the old
headstone has been chiselled, polished, and engraved for quite a while
and it's still gathering moss while waiting for a confinement spot to
mark a grave.
There have been many false alarms. To use the words of Mark Twain,
reports of the death have been greatly exaggerated. They have also been
numerous, and to date they have all been wrong. Books will be written,
hyped, sold, dog-eared, burned, borrowed and stolen well into the next
century and beyond.
Electronics are here to stay as long as we have a machine age. Books
have been around a while longer. They will be around longer yet and they
will give the silicon chip a fair run for its money.
To give an example: A subsurface archaeological survey in the
Mediterranean off Crete once turned up a complex piece of machinery
which, once examined, was revealed to be a kind of computer devised by
some Greek scientist 2000 years ago. They knew what it was, but it was
rusted beyond repair and would not work.
Around the same time, a lad found the Dead Sea Scrolls, approximately
the same age, in a cave. Palaeolinguists today are able to read the
scrolls. Technicians still can't make the computer work.
Books, in one shape or another, have been around a while, and they
seem to go the distance.
Doomsters said the book was a goner when cinema became all the rage.
It survived. It was at death's door when television became a fixture in
the living room. Now, the gloomsters are at it again. There are an
estimated 3,000,000 homes in the UK have a CD-Rom or a computer,
establishing an electronic thin red line against the world of print.
There's the internet in which surfers can access millions upon millions
of words, unimaginable layers of information. Will these innovations
kill off books?
Yes they will. But only some books. The Encyclopaedia Brittanica is
possibly in some danger of extinction, in printed form at least, if the
American experience is anything to go by -- as it so often is. The
Grolier 'paedia, the biggest selling in the States is on CD-Rom and is
vastly outselling its printed sister. The CD is cheaper to produce and
to update. It can store vast amounts of information on a tiny space and
the pictures are clear, the explanations detailed and, like any
encyclopaedia, cross-referenced for ease of access.
It is likely that within the next decade, such tomes will be on slim
disks, or if my scientific sources are correct, on tiny pins of metal
which will last forever.
Booksellers Association expert Sidney Davies says: ''Electronics
hasn't affected the book a great deal . . . yet.
''But in different categories of books, many of them will use
electronic media rather than print. Reference books and manuals for
example, could be produced for use on computers. Where time is critical
and you are seeking information rather than entertainment, there's more
of a chance that it will be provided on-line because that's a convenient
and cost-effective way of getting it across.
''The Grolier is outstripping the printed version because it is
improved by multi-media access, has sound, and great quality pictures.
In this kind of thing, the electronic media has quite an impact.
''But in areas like fiction, the portability of a book is a great
asset. At the moment, there's a lack of computers, too. The number of
computers in homes is tiny in comparison to the number of people who can
read.
''There have always been threats to books. Television and movies were
threats at one time according to the wisdom of the day. It was said that
books would suffer, but the reverse seems to be the case. Books have
done well from TV and films and vice versa.
''The book will certainly survive.''
Sidney adds that the electronic media has affected books in one
interesting way. It makes it far easier to actually publish books using
new technology. While most books are produced by a dozen or so major
publishers in the UK, thanks to desk-top technology there are now about
18,000 active publishers in Britain, some of them only one-man-bands,
who can readily produce books and magazines.
''Whether there is a market is another matter,'' he said, ''but
electronics have increased the number of publishers.''
The Publisher's Association are not getting ready to attend a funeral
either. They feel the book is alive and kicking and going strong.
Susan Blishen says publishers are responding to the challenge of new
technology, and many are getting into electronic publishing.
''But that's suitable mainly for specific information,'' she says.
''Novels, poetry and literary works will survive well in book form
because that's what people like. They want to own books and they feel
comfortable with them. Books are more portable than even small computers
are ever going to be.
''People engage with books in a different way from how they engage
with computers. While many people are fascinated with electronics and
the internet and computer information, most people have too much
affection for books. They have a special place in people's lives.
''You keep on hearing prophets of doom, but we are all getting a bit
tired of them.''
One threat to the book, not fatal but fairly serious, is the high cost
of paper which affects everyone in the publishing trade from newspapers
to magazines and paperback producers.
Susan Blishen says: ''Paper prices are very high at the moment and
some see that as a shortage of print. When high prices are being
charged, the book industry suffers as a result. Some of the major
publishing houses have been forced to restructure because of the current
print crisis.
''But having said that, there are more books being produced than ever
before. Last year in the UK alone, 80,000 new titles were published, and
that is a lot of books. Anyone suggesting that the book is dead should
consider those figures.''
On the electronic front, some books already have been put onto CD-i.
Signet have produced Peter James' Host as an interactive novel in
which the reader can affect the course of the story and even change the
ending.
Other publishers are panting to get into a market they see as new and
exciting and a dangerous one to miss. A significant number of self-help
manuals on a variety of subjects are available in easy access,
easy-to-read form. A number of novels are being digitised for reading
on-screen.
But at the moment, games and applications are for computers.
Electronics have brought books to the blind in recorded form and that
has only added a significant number of listener-readers of books.
When Susan Bishen says the book is far from dead, she's correct. Take
the number of booksellers in what has become a tough and extremely
competitive market. Our own John Smith in Glasgow, and James Thin in
Edinburgh, are always busy, backed with browsers on any day of the week.
WH Smith, Britain's biggest, may not have a presence in Glasgow, but
their subsidiary Waterstones have thousands of works on their shelves.
Dillons may have hit trouble earlier this year, but their store on
Boots Corner has already become a landmark.
Ironically, when electronics and computer engineering students need
reference material and manuals, they go to a bookseller and spend a
fortune. I know. My own resident specialists seem to be keeping that
market afloat very nicely.
And thinking of that, for every electronic device there's a manual
that in some cases weighs more than the computer equipment itself. They
all come in book form and they all seem to weigh a ton, and maybe they
are what accounts for the current paper shortge. A tiny palm-sized
organiser for storing addresses for example comes with a manual
230-pages long.
Computers and CD-Roms are big business, big and booming business and
soon, a sizeable proportion of homes will have one. Access to the
internet is like getting in to a huge reference library where all the
users are allowed to communicate with each other.
There are millions of words and vast amounts of information stored in
the web, just like you found in a library. The analogy goes further. It
can take a fair while to search and find what you are looking for.
CD-i also stores huge amounts of information in small spaces, and
where information storage is concerned, they are probably better for
their purpose than weighty books.
Most of us however, no matter what side of the publishing business
we're on, need have no fear or the continued existence of books, and
here we are not considering manuals as books. They are info-stacks.
Theoretical and academic treatises are in much the same mode. Not books,
only storage bins.
Biographies just scrape by, and the jury is still out of
autobiographies, especially if they are written by rock stars, TV
personalities, or chat-show hosts.
But books, real books, works of fiction and tales of imagination are
alive and well, and are reason enough to deserve a festival of their
own. We may have to bear with Budgie the Helicopter, with Naomi Campbell
cashing in on fame. That's the small price to pay for some of the
miraculous works we have enjoyed since before the Alexandria library
burned down.
Dante's early horror novel is still a classic and since Chaucer
published Britain's first raunchy work in print it's been selling
strongly.
Technology has changed over the years, but the book is much as it was
in Caxton's day. Scientific advances and electronic interfacing will not
kill the book. Instead it will take some to a new level, leaving,
hopefully, plenty of paper aside for more fiction, whether it be Barbara
Cartland or Mills and Boon or the English chap with the new teeth and
the verbal runs.
If encyclopediae go on CD-Rom, that's all to the good because a set of
Britannica weighs a ton and you need a desk to use it, so you might as
well sit at a screen and browse.
But no matter what the gimmick, CD novels will remain a novelty,
simply because screens are not gentle on the eye, and no reader feels
comfortable sitting upright in an operator's chair. You curl up with a
good book, not a 486DX. You go to bed early with a good book and maybe a
wee toddy. You won't let a computer screen gently cover your face as you
doze off, because you just can't.
The only possible threat to the book today is a lack of interest and a
lack of concern for the nation's literacy. It is evident that today's
young people do not have the same literary skills, spelling, punctuation
and the like that their parents had drummed into them in primary schools
in by-gone days. It may have been learned parrot-fashion initially, but
it gave almost everyone in Scotland an entry to the world of books, and
that in itself was a universe of the imagination.
If books are under threat it is from the depletion and erosion of
reading skills. If books are too much of a challenge to read, then the
next generation will opt out. Then it will be time to set the headstone
and let Nintendo take over.
To prevent that scenario we should be teaching all of our children a
simple motto: Get smart . . . read books.

AUTHOR Marsha Hunt yesterday said she had great sympathy with the
citizens of Edinburgh who find themselves crowded out by thousands of
visitors during the three-week International Festival.
As she arrived in the capital to take part in the Edinburgh Book
Festival, Ms Hunt said: ''I do think the people who live in this city
must find it difficult to do their shopping and things and not to be
driven mad by all the visitors.
''From an international point of view, the festival does bring a focus
which means you can go anywhere in the world and the name of Edinburgh
is recognised.''
The former singer, who had a passionate affair with Rolling Stone Mick
Jagger in the 1970s, was one of seven women authors who arrived in a
Book Festival first-class express from London.
The Book Festival party was dominated by women more by accident than
design, said the organisers.
A spokeswoman said: ''We would like to think it shows women are
acquiring a stronger voice in literature.''
Mr Andy Naylor, of InterCity East Coast, said the writers'
capital-to-capital high speed special had been extremely successful.
''InterCity East Coast is delighted to join forces with the Book
Festival for what promises to be a key part of the annual arts
extravaganza,'' he said.

THE cloud hanging over Scottish Opera's participation in the Edinburgh
Festival lifted yesterday when the company and its chorus settled their
industrial dispute after a revised offer from the management.
Scottish Opera's performances of Dvorak's The Jacobin at the festival
next Monday and Wednesday will now go ahead.
Following a single change to the package of offers rejected earlier in
the week by the 34-strong chorus, by which the choristers now no longer
need to audition for their own jobs every two years, the new deal was
''overwhelmingly accepted'' by the singers, according to their union,
Equity.
On Tuesday, after discussions between Equity and Scottish Opera with
the conciliation service, Acas, a package had been offered, with the
union's recommendation for acceptance. The chorus held a secret ballot,
rejected the package, and went on strike the following morning.
Mr Richard Jarman, general director of Scottish Opera, said that the
new deal was one that had been ''hammered out, with compromise on both
sides'', and that the latest element, the suspension of mandatory
auditions, was the factor that secured it.
Mr Drew McFarlane, Scottish organiser of Equity, said yesterday that
the chorus was ''delighted'' with the resolution of the dispute, and he
welcomed the pragmatism of the management, who, he said, ''have at last
moved on the issue of the contractual audition''.
''This wasn't a financial dispute,'' said Mr McFarlane. ''The chorus
understands the financial crisis within the company.'' The need to
re-audition constantly for their own jobs, he said, was always ''the
biggest stumbling block''.
The chorus, he said, would continue to press, through Equity, for fair
pay and improved working conditions.
Under the new deal, the auditions are immediately suspended and Equity
will begin negotiations with Scottish Opera about other methods of
assessment of vocal standards ''appropriate and acceptable to both
parties''. Any failure to agree will then lead to binding arbitration.
The rest of the package, offered earlier in the week, remains
unchanged. It includes a conditional 2% pay rise from the beginning of
next year, a week's extra holiday, and the opportunity for choristers to
take special auditions for small solo roles in productions.
Mr Jarman said yesterday that the dispute highlighted ''in dramatic
terms'' the problems of the company. ''The underfunding of Scottish
Opera is critical,'' he said. ''You can only squeeze the company so much
before ending up with something like this -- a demoralised company.''
He expressed relief that the dispute was over and said that, if the
performances of The Jacobin had had to be cancelled, ''it would have
been a very, very black day for Scottish Opera with the loss of fees,
other costs, and the loss of credibility, too''.
The production of The Jacobin is moved today to the Edinburgh Festival
Theatre where the dress rehearsal will take place tonight.

POLICE in Edinburgh are to launch a crackdown on crime as the city
prepares to welcome an estimated 250,000 visitors to the three-week
international festival.
Lothian and Borders Police aim to keep trouble to a minimum through a
high-profile crime prevention campaign and increased street policing,
ensuring a rapid response to incidents.
Festival and Fringe venues, hotels, guest houses, and public buildings
have already co-operated with the drive by providing crime prevention
information in foreign languages for visitors.
A summer anti-crime drive has already begun in the city centre, with
an increased police presence at caravans in the High Street and Princes
Street Gardens.
A free telephone information line has also been set up by police for
visitors.
Detective Superintendent Douglas Evans said previous experience had
shown the festival drive had worked in cutting crime.
''Last year we had only 27 thefts from nearly 200 festival venues.
This works out at just one theft to every 30,000 people attending these
events. However, that is still too many,'' he said.
He revealed only 10 thefts had been reported during last month's Cutty
Sark Tall Ships Race in Leith, when nearly one million people visited
the capital.
He appealed for further help from the business community in
implementing the initiative.
''With the assistance of shopkeepers, hotel and restaurant staff, taxi
and bus drivers, and other members of the Edinburgh retail community, we
can get the message across to visitors that by being alert and taking
care of their property they will greatly reduce the chance of becoming a
victim of crime.
''Like any police force in a large city, we cannot drive crime away,
but by having a dedicated team of officers on duty for the festival we
can ensure the police response to any incident will be rapid and
investigated efficiently and thoroughly.''
* The Royal Bank of Scotland has also called for increased vigilance
among Edinburgh businesses to reduce the danger of plastic card fraud.
The bank has already taken steps to cut back on such fraud by printing
a photograph of the account holder on the back of the card.

WARNING:  This story subject of legal action.  Do not use or quote.  (RBJ
3/11/95)
SCOTS could soon be entering the twilight zone when a mystery being
reveals the secrets of the universe in Falkirk Town Hall.
Councillor Billy Buchanan claims Zal-us -- a mystery man who dresses
immaculately in a black suit, white shirt, and black tie -- is set to
speak in public for the first time.
His strange alliance with the man in black began when Zal-us visited
the regional councillor, who represents Bonnybridge, Stirlingshire, in    his
offices a few months ago.
Mr Buchanan now claims Zal-us is willing to go public and reveal an
explanation for the so-called ''Bonnybridge Phenomenon'' and other    baffling
mysteries.
Bonnybridge has been dubbed Britain's UFO capital due to hundreds of
alleged sightings of UFOs in recent years.
Mr Buchanan himself has been active in pressing for a top-level
Government inquiry into the sightings and has even written to the Prime
Minister demanding action.
He is so convinced by the mystery man he has paid #40 to book Falkirk Town
Hall and is inviting members of the public to attend.
Mr Buchanan revealed that Zal-us is a member of the Council of Nine, a
group which watches over the Earth and keeps an eye on its people.
He added: ''Quite simply, what this man has to say will be the most
important thing we have ever heard.
''It will be of great importance, not just for Scotland, but the whole
world.
''He told me all about the Council of Nine, who watch over us to make sure
we don't blow the planet up, and about why mankind is here.
''I can't really say anymore than that at the moment, but what he has
to say is all good news. It's very positive, and there is no reason to be
afraid.''
Last night, Mr Malcom Robinson, of UFO investigation group Strange
Phenomena Investigations, said he was aware of Mr Buchanan's meetings
with the mystery man.
Mr Robinson, of Tullibody, added: ''We've got to be really careful
here, but this could turn out to be an earth shattering development if    it
all goes ahead.''
For those who dare, the meeting is scheduled for October 9. It is
expected the town hall will be filled to its 900 capacity.

THE SNP took the moral high-ground yesterday, claiming its political
opponents unfairly ''pack'' key council committees.
The Scottish Nationalists challenged the other parties to follow their
lead and mirror the views of their voters when picking committees.
They have also called on the Government to introduce legislation,
which already applies in England and Wales, north of the Border.
SNP vice-president Mr Andrew Welsh yesterday criticised the Government
for failing to implement the legislation which requires political
balance on council committees.
Mr Welsh said the reason he had been given for this was that it did
not want to intervene in local politics.
''It is pretty disgraceful, and a clear dereliction of responsibility,
to argue there is little advantage in ensuring balance and democracy in
Scotland's councils,'' he said.
With the advent of the new unitary authorities, Mr Welsh believes it
is time for change and cited the three councils dominated by the SNP as
examples of how local government in Scotland should operate.
As the other side of the coin, he highlighted the siutation in
Labour-controlled Clydebank, where opposition councillors are barred
from all committees.
He said: ''These malpractices and bad practices should not overflow
into the new authorities.
Vowing to pursue the campaign, SNP activist Ms Maureen Watt said the
voters were looking for proportionality.

ALLAN LAING meets Valerie Edmond whose latest part promises to have
'em reeling in the aisle
WHEN Scots actress Valerie Edmond's agent telephoned to say that she'd
been offered a role in the next Death Wish movie, she naturally leapt at
the chance. And then she paused for thought.
''I said to myself 'I'm going to get blown away by Charles Bronson!
Then I thought, well, he must be in a wheelchair by now. Maybe he's
going to play it like Ironside,'' she recalls, not entirely seriously.
It was, as it turned out, a bad line. The telephone. The Death bit was
right but the Wish was a Fish. Put them together and you get Death Fish
II, the working title for the forthcoming follow-up to A Fish Called
Wanda. It stars John Cleese, a man who, when you think about it, is
about as far removed from Charles Bronson as it is possible to get.
Still, unfazed, Edmond continued to leap at the chance.
She's that kind of person, Valerie. If opportunities arise then she'll
positively embrace them. This is a wise move because they don't come
around so often for Scottish actresses -- even when they're 27 years
old, vivacious, intelligent, witty, and positively statuesque.
Now, it has to be said that Valerie's role in Death Fish is not the
biggest in the movie. She plays a hotel chambermaid and, as she modestly
admits, if you look down to see how much popcorn's left in the box,
you'll miss her.
''It's really only a tiny part,'' she explains, pinching the thumb and
forefinger of her right hand to illustrate its diminutive size. ''I get
one line: 'Would you like your sheets turned down?' to which John Cleese
replies 'No thank you' and slams the door in my face.''
The refreshing thing about Valerie Edmond is the fact that she doesn't
talk like an actress. No lah-de-dahs. No luvvie dahlings. Not a hint of
conceit. She talks like a smart, reasonably confident, working-class
young woman from Springburn. Which she is. But now she's a little more.
She's a name to keep an eye on. Remember where you heard it first.
When she was a 15-year-old pupil at Albert Secondary it was a toss-up
between writing and acting as a career. Something which would allow her
to use her imagination (your imagination, she reckons, is the best place
to be).
She auditioned for the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and
was provisionally accepted. The only problem was that the college, like
X-rated movies, wouldn't accept anyone who was under 18.
So she went back to her headmaster who had her RSAMD application form
tucked away in a filing cabinet. On the pretext of wanting to add a line
about her pastimes and hobbies, she got hold of the form. A spot of
Typex, a ballpoint pen, and as if by magic Valerie aged three years
overnight. She was 18 (going on 21) when she graduated with a BA in
dramatic studies and an award for Best Student of the Year.
Since then she has worked in the theatre with companies like
Borderline and Wildcat and she's done a couple of Taggarts for STV (Come
on, she's Scottish and she's in the acting game.) Later this month you
can see her in BBC1's new sitcom, Agony Again, in which Maureen Lipman
reprises her 1970s LWT role of Agony Aunt Jane Lucas. Now Jane has moved
on to become a successful media celebrity, hosting her own afternoon
talk show. Valerie plays Catherine, her researcher.
''I wear a long red wig and talk in a kind of Giffnock accent -- not
that there's anything wrong with a Giffnock accent. Catherine is very
timid and nervous and completely conscientious. In fact, she's
everything I'm not,'' she explains with an engaging smile. Indeed, it is
probably fair to say that Valerie is about as far removed from her
character as, well, Charles Bronson is from John Cleese.
Modesty returns to the conversation. Edmond volunteers the information
that, as much as her acting ability, she reckons that it was her
friendship with Maureen Lipman which helped gain her the part. They met
when Lipman directed her in The Sunshine Boys at the Royal Lyceum in
Edinburgh.
''We got on very well and I'm sure that she had something to do with
me getting the part in Agony. She is a sensational person to work with
-- intelligent, beautiful, very wise and very caring to other actors.
''She really is the consummate professional and, when you watch her,
you learn so much. You get sitcom acting and you get acting in sitcom
and she knows how to act. Whatever she does is good. Whether it's comic
or straight, there is always a person there,'' she adds.
Valerie recognises that a lot of sitcoms, with their bland,
middle-class, Home Counties backdrop, don't travel well north of the
Border but she reckons that Agony Again will make the journey unscathed.
''Sometimes sitcoms are very difficult to write because the pressure
of always having to make them funny means that the storyline gets
neglected. But with this one it's the story which comes first and the
fact that it's funny follows on,'' she says.
This month, on the strength of Death Fish and Agony Again, Valerie is
off to London, the place where, sadly in a way, all young Scottish
actors must go if fame and fortune are big on their hit list. She's
found herself a flat in Notting Hill and she's prepared to give it two
years. She says, somewhat philosophically, that you are who you are --
until you find success. And then you call the shots.
''For the moment, it's great. I'm doing exactly what I want to do with
my life. I'll just keep my fingers crossed that I get invited to the
wrap party for Death Fish II,'' she adds. All Valerie Edmond has to do
is wait and see if the fish bites.

A PRISONER has been refused 90 minutes of freedom to play in a
football match.
George Stewart wanted to play in today's Highland Amateur Cup
semi-final at Ullapool.
The Inverness club Lochiel FC, which is playing Ness from the Western
Isles, wrote to prison officials asking for permission to include the
striker in their line-up.
However, a Scottish Prison Service spokesman last night ruled out any
possibility of Stewart being released for the cup-tie.
Team-mates had hoped the 27-year-old could be taken to and from the
game under prison guard to boost their chances of becoming the first
Inverness side to lift the trophy.
Former Highland League player Stewart was tipped for the very top
before allegedly wrecking his football career with drink and drug abuse.
He scored five goals for Lochiel just days before a sheriff jailed him
for three months after he admitted resisting arrest and breaking the
peace.
The Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: ''We have received
requests for Mr Stewart to be allowed to take part in a soccer match,
but we could not seriously consider releasing a him for this sort of
reason.
''Prisoners can be released for compassionate reasons -- if a close
relative is ill or for a funeral, or if he is coming to the end of a
long prison term and needs a release for work placements or for job
training.
''A football match is a different matter altogether.''
Club captain Gary Mackenzie said: ''He would have made a real
difference to our chances. We're major underdogs. He's still some player
despite all his problems.''

THE heatwave has accelerated the growth of dangerous blue and green
algae on waterways and ponds, council environmental health experts in
Edinburgh warned yesterday.They highlighted the serious health risk to
children and dogs if they swallowed water containing the algae.
Senior environmental health officer Mr Gordon Greenhill said: ''The
algae is naturally present in waterways but multiplies furiously in hot,
sunny conditions.'' The present dangerous levels will subside naturally
following heavy rainfall.

THERE is Edinburgh and there is the Edinburgh Festival; but these are
distinct entities, separate in being, and much more strained in their
relations than many suppose. They have August in common, and one hosts
the other, and that is as far as kinship goes. For our visitors at this
time, Edinburgh is the Festival. For those who live and work in
Edinburgh, year-round, the Festival is a month-long extravaganza at
best, a nuisance at worst.
The Festival, of course, has its parts. There is the Royal Military
Tattoo, night upon night, with two showings on a Saturday night. This
clutters up the Old Town with untold busloads of Oop North sightseers,
keen for a flash of sporran, and locks the city centre in a security
clench worthy of a presidential visit.
Manhole covers and letter boxes are welded shut. Policemen swarm about
Castle Rock. If you pass within spitting distance of a military coach,
holding anything more substantial than a tube of Polo mints, you will be
stopped while your booty is examined. I am stopped very often because
the average Edinburgh bobby thinks my accent Irish.
When the Tattoo finishes, in a howl of bagpipes and a thud of
fireworks, and the happy people spew forth, you are not even allowed to
cross a road in your own time. Determinedly nice policemen hold you up
in lumps and make you cross the road 100 at a time, like schoolchildren.
Then there is the Official Festival. This is a most grand affair,
traditionally directed by Englishmen, and has tenure of the capital's
principal theatres and concert-halls. There are not so many official
Edinburgh Festival events, but they are lavish, expensive, and feature
some of the world's premier artists and companies. There is always
something very traditional, and there is always something that goes
badly wrong and attracts much delighted press coverage, and there is
always something rather outrageous.
Much bigger -- and, for most people, the main event -- is the
Edinburgh Festival Fringe. This, for many years, has been just as
organised and orchestrated as the official Festival; indeed, there has
been for some years a fringe to the Fringe, and no doubt there will soon
be a fringe to that too, like lesser fleas to bite 'em. It is the
Fringe, and its multitude of performers -- many talented, hundreds
hopeful, thousands as earnest as they are ridiculous -- which really
possess the city.
Try going to church, and the hall is closed off and the Sunday school
off for the duration, because it is now Venue 83, and the Humberside
Women Against Patriarchy quartet are nightly staging grim agitprop on
Stateside oppression.
Try walking up the Royal Mile. Unless you are very rude, or very
determined, you will crest the hill awash with paper -- fliers jammed in
pockets, damp in your hands, advertising a myriad different plays,
monologues and evenementes.
One of those days you will really go to something on the strength of a
badly photocopied leaflet wadged in your fist.
How is Edinburgh in August? It is warm, very dry; pavements sticky
with failed ice-cream, gutters jammed with crumpled fliers, visitors
wandering about in gaggles. There are enormous and dour Germans,
marching clans of noisy Italians, unsmiling Orientals who cannot see an
open door without walking through it. (We used to attend a Free Church
at the top of the Royal Mile, and the Wednesday night prayer meeting
suffered unique problems; deacons spent much of the night persuading
assorted Japanese that, no, it really was not a play they would enjoy,
and especially in Gaelic.)
It is at night, in August, during the Festival, that Edinburgh comes
into its own. Then the city hums with people, with activity, and there
is an illusion of warmth and fellowship. Bookshops stay open till
midnight. Restaurants and cafes put lights and tables outside,
Continental style.
It is not dark until late, and Edinburgh's lovely twilit skies glow
over her spires and gables, pink and copper and turquoise, marbled with
wisps of cloud. When it is warm here it is not the thick, salty heat of
the west; it is dry heat, comfortable. You wander about the West End,
even past 11, in shirt sleeves.
An illusion, as I said: a sense of fiddling while Rome burns. There is
much poverty in Edinburgh, and much ugliness; indeed, Fountainbridge and
Gorgie, within ready walk of Edinburgh's theatreland, have a decayed
grimness making mock of aesthetic delight. But I have been at night on
Edinburgh streets, gay and bright with playgoers, concert-hearers and
visitors, in August 1990, when Saddam invated Kuwait and there dawned
the reality of near and apocalyptic war. Who cared? The night was warm
and the lights bright and the wine sweet, and all seemed joyous, and all
the world seemed in love.
For those who will not leave the streets for art, art must hit the
streets. What would Edinburgh be in August without its chapmen of
performance? You go down the Mound, by the Playfair Steps, and run a
gauntlet of traders squatting by the railing: they proffer jewellery of
mangled metal, display framed and pressed dried flowers, pack healing
crystals in plastic envelopes, dangle tiny bottles of this and sachets
of that. Pale young people with dilated pupils make music on strange
wooden instruments.
There is always a teenaged piper or three. And by the National Gallery
there is always a huddle, a big crowd about some little show. As you
elbow your way into the throng you are never quite sure what you will
see, but it is sometimes a fire-eater, and sometimes a jazz quartet, and
sometimes acrobatic tumblers.
It would not be the Edinburgh Festival at all if, in the course of
August, you failed to see a unicyclist. And, of course, there is the
inevitable mime, panda-eyed and pathetic, trying to press his way out of
an imaginary Perspex cube.
The reputation of the Edinburgh Festival rests largely on the
character of the city itself. Edinburgh, especially in its centre, Old
Town and New Town, remains most beautiful. It has been spared the
eviscerating impact of modern road systems of the sort that gutted
Glasgow in the sixties. It remains a city small in its heart, compact,
friendly to pedestrians. And, in its prominent landmarks, its quaint old
buildings, it has much European feeling.
It is a city, in August, ideal for the poseur. The Festival's
exuberant street life lends it an amoral, medieval aspect: a world of
fools, rhymers, pedlars, and merry minstrels. Then there are its salons,
from the many assorted cafe-bars and patisseries to the three branches
of Waterstone's; and you can fancy yourself in the world of
Enlightenment letters, and feel most sophisticated.
There is a real ''theatreland'' -- the compact square mile by Lothian
Road, where the happy spill from the Usher Hall and the Lyceum and the
King's and the Traverse, on to pedestrianised concourses below the
mighty ramparts of the Castle, and feel beautiful.
And there is the decadent Edinburgh: the Edinburgh of sleazy pubs and
loose women and dank closes and low eating-places, the Edinburgh of
Leith Walk and Tollcross. The city has an underbelly feel, as Glasgow;
but Glasgow's dark side is one of dirty money and crime. Edinburgh has
the aura of hidden vice; a reality of intrigue, adultery, drugs, gay
bars, and glitzy casinos, deliciously veiled by the perceived facade of
Presbyterian rectitude.
There is another darkness to the Festival of Edinburgh: a reality that
vexes many who live in the city, and some who visit it at this time.
There is, for one, a long-standing tension between civic Edinburgh and
the Festival jollities. The corporation of old, and the council of
today, remain reluctant to invest significant sums in cultural hardware.
The Festival was 40 years old before councillors began seriously to
think of building an opera house.
For many years, indeed, Edinburgh councillors conveyed the distinct
impression that the Festival was a nuisance and a waste of their
valuable energies. Only in the past decade has municipal Edinburgh begun
to invest significant resources in architecture, theatre facilities and
so on, partly because the city has now thrown off its once-perpetual
Tory regime, and partly because Edinburgh was, through the eighties,
consistently bested by Glasgow in the quest for international
recognition.
Then there is the notoriously Anglicised character of the Festival
itself. Senior directors and organisers, as in much of Scotland's
aesthetic life, emerge largely from south of the Border. The English are
the most prominent, and vocal, of city visitors at this time.
The Festival has never really come to grips with the ordinary folk of
the city. Oh, there are Fringe events staged in Wester Hailes, and the
poor tenements of western Edinburgh are fair and handy for the theatres.
But the Festival is irredeemably, perhaps unfairly, smeared with the
brush of privilege and elitism.
Edinburgh is not as large, as wealthy, or as egalitarian as Glasgow.
It remains a city with remarkable social division and a dearth of
amenities for ordinary people. There are not enough libraries, not
enough swimming-pools, not enough swing parks or playgrounds.
Everyone has heard of Easterhouse or Possilpark; but there are housing
estates in Edinburgh far poorer, and no less vicious, which the tourist
never sees and which motorists seldom pass. Against the realities of
West Granton, or Craigmillar, the froth of Festival seems insipid and
insulting.
The saddest aspect of the Festival, for the Edinburgh man with a grasp
of history, is how far it seems from the city's great days in the
history of Scottish Christianity. Noisy Sabbath-breaking -- it is on
Sunday that the event is formally launched -- and the more degenerate
aspects of the Fringe would appal such men as Knox, Buchanan, and
Chalmers. But then, it was at an Edinburgh Festival many years ago that
the Queen's cousin, the Earl of Harewood, ignorantly dismissed Knox as a
''tiresome old thunderer''.
Perhaps the sunset fantasy of an Edinburgh back in the late 1700s, a
New Town of wit and sophistication, is truer than we know. Increasingly
in August, she takes on the air of a Hogarth cartoon: money and vanity
abundant, despair and misery below. There are homeless beggars back on
our streets, sodden drunks in the gutters, lost gamins wandering by
night. We have not, quite reached at the stage of stepping over them to
get to the opera. But, as matters run, we shortly will.

WHAT with the lack of native peoples to annihilate, trackless wastes
to explore, and obscure rocks to claim for Her Majesty, stout chaps with
double-barrelled names are hard-pressed these days to find stupid ways
to occupy themselves. In August, contrariwise, TV reviewers are
hard-pressed to discover any occupation less stupid than watching them
do it.
Thus, in A Cook on the Wild Side (Channel 4, Wednesday), Hugh
Fearnley-Whittingstall -- presumably a name borrowed from a firm of
country solicitors -- announced himself as a chap who would eat
anything.
Alternatively, he was a ''discontented urban foodie'' who wanted his
protein natural and, if at all possible, weird. In reality, he was the
latest example of television's gluttonous appetite for potty cookery
shows.
Once upon a time it was sufficient just to point a camera at Fanny
Craddock, the harridan from Harrods, while she banged a couple of pots
together. Then came a screeching gourmet who, for unaccountable reasons,
galloped. Later Delia Smith simpered over the sticky toffee pudding and
the nation took her to its sclerotic heart. Floyd then made a name for
himself by quaffing copiously and screwing up simple dishes in exotic
locations.
Somehow it wasn't enough.
Not so long ago an Australian in a strange hat tramped the bush
proving that people could eat just about anything while never saying why
they might want to. Now comes young Fearnley-Whittingstall, grinning,
eager and irritating, to produce minnows done up as whitebait on a
platter of green sludge, a witch whose repertoire seemed to consist
solely of nauseating-sounding home-made wine, and an old Welsh fisherman
in a coracle who caught absolutely nothing. That may have been the
exciting bit.
To say this show was contrived is rather like saying a Big Mac is a
shade unappetising. To discover that things called hogweed shoots can
actually be consumed is to realise, yet again, that there must be more
to life than this. A Cook on the Wild Side was entirely without point,
rather like Mr F-W's superfluous extra name. Perhaps the only sustenance
it offered was the thought of all those self-sufficiency freaks who will
now make themselves ill eating things to which even goats would give a
wide berth.
The single saving grace was that Lloyd Grossman was nowhere to be
seen.
The saving graces of HMS Brilliant: Rocking the Boat (BBC1, Wednesday)
were the Wrens. I don't know what they'd do to an enemy but, by God,
they frightened the hell out of their male counterparts, a band of
brothers ready to risk death off the Croatian coast but whining and
bitching like closet queens at the ''girlies'' on board.
Unsurprisingly, it turned out that the Wrens were all good at their
jobs -- doubtless the real reason why the chaps despised them so -- and
thoroughly miserable because of the treatment they had received.
One man, at least, had the decency quietly to admit they were far more
professional than the male ''dross'' he had to work with. This did not,
of course, prevent the gallant matelots responding to some gentle
concert party ribbing with the witty chorus, ''Get ''em off for the
lads!''
The disturbing thought left by this excellent piece -- and who'd have
thought yet another documentary about the forces could command any
attention? -- was that the ultra-modern hardware on board Brilliant is
in the hands of a bunch of yobs you wouldn't entrust with a blunt
chisel. Hearts of oak? Heads of finest antique teak.
Still, none of this should delude us into believing a woman can't be
just as appalling as any man. Public Eye: Love Thy Neighbour (BBC2,
Tuesday) exhibited one specimen with six brats, 20 cats, a rabbit, a
goat, and a husband (distinguishable from the goat by his ability to
walk upright) with convictions for threatening behaviour. Her sole
mission, proudly professed, was to make life hell on earth for her
neighbours, especially, or so it appeared, the elderly ones, preferably
if they were in wheelchairs.
This individual's mental state did not bear thinking of. Not only did
she enjoy recounting her ''victories'', the presence of a camera seemed
to bring her to full, gruesome life, puffing her up as we watched, as
though she were drawing vitality from its glare. Her eyes scuttled
around her head like something from under a stone that has just
persuaded Fearnley-Whittingstall he might not be hungry after all.
Nothing she said, not a syllable of it, suggested even a theoretical
knowledge of decency.
The purpose of the piece was to explore the Labour's new-found
enthusiasm for dealing with such problem families. Blair himself has
vaulted on to the bandwagon with promises to smite the antisocial, or at
least put them on probation before banging them up. As it turned out, of
course, the party's new policies are no improvement on anyone else's.
You can move these problems around; solving them is quite another
matter. This may just become something a theme after Labour takes power.
Still, any species capable of dropping atomic bombs on itself probably
shouldn't be expected to solve social problems overnight. Thus the many
hours of coverage accorded to the 50th anniversaries of the experimental
immolation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been cut through with an
unease absent from the VE Day parties.
Why, commentator after commentator asked, haven't the Japanese
apologised for the atrocities they committed? Perhaps, this reviewer
kept thinking, because the West has yet to admit the enormity of its own
crime, less the last shot of the Second World War than the opening salvo
of the Cold one.
Hiroshima -- The Decision to Drop The Bomb (BBC1, Sunday) was the best
and most coherent of the documentaries in that it gave proper weight to
the geo-political imperatives behind the Enola Gay trial run. It was
sober, factual and honest, marred only by the fruitless panel debate
that followed.
Still, the efforts of Joan Bakewell, ever-ready to impale herself on
thorny issues and arrive at no useful answer, were more valuable than an
almost insultingly-bad ''film-poem'', The Shadow of Hiroshima (Channel
4, Sunday), by Tony Harrison. The egotism that drives all artists comes
perilously close to appearing obscene in the context of Hiroshima. That
Harrison's poem had, unusually it must be said, more than a passing
resemblance to doggerel only made things worse.
Finally, and with some relief, a word of praise for The Ken Fine Show
(ITV, Thursday) produced by Edinburgh's HandPict for Scottish. Hosting
the piece Jack Docherty was funny and informative, a trick much harder
than it sounds, while exploring Scots, that fugitive language. A
sequence on Edinburgh's surviving chimney sweeps, a team dedicated to
ensuring that your lum need not reek missus, was merely beautiful. The
word is ''barrie''.

SHADOW Minister of Overseas Development George Foulkes has become the
first Labour MP in Scotland to be selected as prospective parliamentary
candidate for his re-drawn constituency.
Mr Foulkes, 53, will contest the enlarged Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon
Valley constituency at the the next election after being elected
unanimously by the local party.
The seat which he will be defending will include all of his present
seat plus Doonfoot, Alloway, Forehill, and part of Belmont from the
present Ayr constituency.
Conservative MP Phil Gallie was unsuccessful in a legal bid to have
the Boundary Commission's changes overturned and to have his Ayr
constituency left intact.
Mr Foulkes, who has represented the area since 1979, said: ''I am
delighted that party members have demonstrated their continuing
confidence and support. It is with great pride that I represent such a
historic part of Scotland.

CONSERVATIVE Party leaders were yesterday rushing in to exploit the
gap that has opened up in the Labour Party between Mr Tony Blair's inner
sanctum and the left wing of the party.
Tory party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney claimed that criticism of the
Labour leadership was ''spreading like wildfire'' through Labour Party
ranks.
In Scotland, Scottish Office Minister Raymond Robertson seized on
comments by Labour MPs Dennis Canavan and George Galloway in yesterday's
Herald to claim that these ''old-guard Socialists terrify businessmen
and scare-off inward investment''.
The Conservative Party has been keen to declare a summer offensive on
Labour, but so far has found little bad news to stick to Mr Blair's
leadership. Now though it scents blood, following Birmingham MP Richard
Burden's claims that Labour was now run by a tightly-knit inner sanctum
around Mr Blair holding a virtual monopoly of party ideas.
Mr Blair's control over party policy is likely to be criticised this
weekend in Glasgow at a conference organised by the Campaign for
Socialism, which was formed to defend the beliefs in Labour's original
Clause 4, which was changed by Mr Blair.
In particular, the Campaign for Socialism is likely to spring to the
defence of a Scottish Parliament being given the right to increase
income tax in Scotland by up to 3p in the pound. Reports suggest that Mr
Blair wants to limit that commitment.
Tory Minister Mr Robertson, taking his lead from recent comments of
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, repeated yesterday that this would
be Labour's Tartan Tax.
''The hard-line leftists attending this conference, including Labour
MPs Dennis Canavan and George Galloway, are representative of the people
who would sit in Labour's tax-raising Edinburgh parliament. They are
political dinosaurs, frantic to sink their fangs in the jugular of the
Scottish taxpayer,'' he said.
He claimed that ''open rebellion'' had now broken out within the
Labour Party, and that it was increasingly between Scottish Labour and
more moderate elements south of the Border.
''Voters in England and Wales can laugh at this hard-left faction, but
in Scotland we are threatened with a parliament which would be
controlled by them and which would impose taxes upon us which no other
United Kingdom citizens would pay.
''These old-guard Socialists terrify businessmen and scare off inward
investment. They would destroy Scotland's growing prosperity with the
Tartan Tax.
''They may be ridiculous but their deliberations should be watched
intently by every taxpayer in Scotland. This is a trailer for a
Labour-controlled Scottish Parliament,'' he stated.
Blair loyalists attempted to portray Mr Burden's outburst as a touch
of summer madness from a bitter man unhappy at being passed over for
promotion.
But comments from other Labour activists yesterday simply threw more
fuel on the fire.
Left-wing MP Ken Livingstone said Mr Blair had come under ''real
criticism'' at meetings of the Parliamentary Labour Party this year on
his approach to unions and education.
''It was not the left criticising him, but honest long-standing Labour
party right-wingers -- the sort of loyalists who put him in office --
who feel somehow he does not reflect their class-based loyalty to the
party.''
Leading trade unionist Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the
general workers' union, the GMB, wrote in the Tribune that Mr Blair had
made too many changes too quickly and was playing to the electorate
rather than appealing to his own party.
How strong the resentment within Labour over the power of Mr Blair's
advisers is difficult to gauge, although there is certainly simmering
resentment in some quarters.
Mr Blair's so-called inner sanctum has been described in derogatory
terms as ''a group of yuppies in smart suits constantly using mobile
phones'', which is supposed to send shivers down the spines of
traditionalists who believe the party is losing touch with its roots.
Nevertheless, Mr Blair's advisers have been extrememly successful,
building the party's image into one which has left the Conservatives
trailing in the opinion polls.
His team includes two Scots, former political editor Alastair
Campbell, who has done much to repair Labour's tattered image with the
media, and quietly spoken Edinburgh graduate Pat McFadden, who formerly
worked for Mr John Smith and Mr Donald Dewar, and who helps Labour's
liasion with the unions.

THE resources of firefighters were stretched as the continuing dry
weather made Scotland's countryside a tinderbox yesterday. Brigades had
to tackle many fires on hillsides and in open spaces.
Six people were evacuated as a precaution from a group of farm
cottages at Dolphinstone Farm, near Wallyford, East Lothian, as fire
swept across crop fields over an area one mile by half-a-mile. A column
of thick black smoke could be seen for miles above the scene of the
fire.
Firefighters with seven appliances from Lothian and Borders Brigade
controlled the outbreak after more than two hours. A secondary road
between Wallyford and Tranent was closed by police and traffic diverted.
A brigade spokesman appealed to the public to be ''extra vigilant''
about how they disposed of cigarettes, matches, inflammable materials,
and glass.
''With this long, dry spell it does not take much for a small fire to
spread quickly. Even broken glass can act like a magnifier and start a
fire,'' said the spokesman. ''Anybody having picnics and making camp
fires should be very careful.''
Meanwhile, high above Dumbarton last night, a deep orange glow from
the flames of a huge moor fire shone in the dusk over the Long Crags
Hills.
Teams of firefighters from Strathclyde have been fighting the blaze in
a round-the-clock battle since it started on Dumbarton Muir on Thursday.
Farmers herded livestock away from the flames, which have destroyed
trees and bushes on the Auchentorlie Estate above Bowling, killing
wildlife and birds -- including grouse on the eve of the Glorious
Twelfth.
Fire Brigade resources were further stretched when a similar fire
broke out at the Ben Bouie Forest between Helensburgh and Loch Lomond
last night. Four pumps and more than 20 firefighters were sent there.
A spokesman at the Strathclyde Fire Brigade control centre in
Johnstone, Renfrewshire, said: ''Firefighters have been taking water
from streams and ponds to damp down more than two square miles of peat
fire in the Old Kilpatrick Hills.
''Similar work is being done to tackle the same kind of fire six miles
down the road in the hills near Helensburgh golf course.''
In the Highlands, firefighters were recalled to the charred remains of
a woodland yesterday when a fire first extinguished 10 days ago flared
up again.
The Highlands' largest blaze for years destroyed more than 100 acres
of prime forestry land at Daviot Wood, near Inverness.
When it was first put out, firefighters warned it could start again if
the wind rose. That happened yesterday when smouldering peat 6ft below
the surface ignited again. A helicopter was called in to water-bomb the
blaze and at its height 26 firefighters with four appliances and a water
bowser were fighting the fire, which was racing forward on a two-mile
front.
In Langholm in South-west Scotland, more than 100 firefighters and
workers were fighting a grass fire.
The Forestry Commission brought in a helicopter to drop water on the
seat of the fire which was spreading towards a forest. Ten fire units
from Dumfries and Galloway, Borders, and Cumbria were fighting the blaze
.
The Dumfries and Galloway force was stretched when another fire was
discovered near New Galloway.

THE Boston-born trumpeter and writer Dick Sudhalter has spent the last
eight years of his life painstakingly putting together a book which he
knows will bring down on him the wrath of the new jazz establishment.
Sudhalter, you see, is about to champion the cause of white jazz
musicians in a music which has been undergoing what he describes as
''selective revision by Wynton Marsalis, Stanley Crouch, and their many
allies''.
In essence Sudhalter will combat the growing suggestions that jazz is
wholly an Afro-American music and stress that the music is American
without any need for racial or ethnic hyphenation to describe it.
Over the years, of course, there has always been a tendency in jazz
criticism to thrust black musicians ahead of white musicians whether
they have earned that position or not.
Everyone recognises that the big white bands of the thirties gained
enormous financial success, often based on the music of black arrangers
or black sidemen. Benny Goodman had Fletcher Henderson penning his
finest charts and his quarter featured giants Teddy Wilson and Lionel
Hampton; Tommy Dorsey featured the writing of Sy Oliver and had the
magnificent Charlie Shavers in his trumpet section; Artie Shaw at
various times had Roy Eldridge and Hot Lips Page play with his orchestra
and there are many other examples.
And so as the major bandleaders grew rich it seemed once more that the
blacks were being exploited and so to salve critical consciences white
jazz was pushed into the background.
Until, now, you have the white contribution sidelined almost entirely
. . .
Yet musicians never did see it that way. Over the years prominent
black musicians have talked of the influence of white players. Rex
Stewart cites Bix Beiderbecke as an early influence; Coleman Hawkins
used to tell of Jimmy Harrison being in awe of the young Jack Teagarden
when he first arrived in New York and Lester Young always paid tribute
to the saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer.
Sudhalter was commissioned by Oxford University Press to write the
book back in l987. He says: ''The original idea was modest,
straightforward: a small collection of essays, Whitney Balliett-style,
on a few prominent white jazzmen to counterbalance the new emphasis on
black musicians.
''But the more I researched the more the subject grew until it has
become a work which will challenge the blight of political correctness
now affecting the jazz world.
''The rhythmic basis of the music grew from the black experience as
did a lot of the inflectional elements of the melodic vocabulary. But
jazz was also a music built on a European (ie white) harmonic system and
methods of melodic organisation and phrase building.''
He adds: ''In New York in the twenties there were distinctive white
styles, Red Nichols and Miff Mole groups; Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang and
Adrian Rollini who didn't swing the way the Harlem bands did but were
infinitely more inventive both melodically and harmonically.''
Sudhalter hopes that the book will not be looked on as a political
document. He wants the message to be inclusive not exclusive and
believes that an understanding of what he is attempting will allow
people to hear the music in its full glory.
The working title is Lost Chords: The White Contribution to Jazz,
1900-45. I have spoken to Sudhalter about the book several times and
there will be truths aplenty, not all of them palatable to the critical
establishment.
And I know it will be written with the same lyricism he brings to his
trumpet playing. The book we must wait to evaluate -- it should be
finished sometime this year -- but his trumpet playing can be judged on
a new CD recorded in London last year.
It is Beiderbecke distilled through Hackett and always Sudhalter's
love of this type of music shines through. Just as it always does in his
writing . . .

HARRY RITCHIE'S delicious and malicious account of a package holiday
brought back memories of a March holiday I once had in Tenerife when
only the ferocity of the sun reminded me that I was somewhere else, and
everyone else was reading the Sun newspaper.
Here We Go A Summer on the Costa del Sol (Radio Scotland) abridged by
David Jackson Young and read with intelligent relish by Jimmy Chisolm,
captured the travel experience of many. His manifesto was that travel
writers mostly are on a good scam: after a good lunch with a publisher
they get geared up to pretend they were not on a scam by foraging from
their overdrawn psyches an intense interest in Andalusian folk stories
or the obsessive need to explore Afghanistan by push bike.
If you are a bit blocked and the words ''sunblock'' make you salivate,
then the travel book is the obvious solution.
But Ritchie went package to Malaga and from the moment he got off the
plane he was passed from one Thomson lady to another until he reached a
hotel which in the brochure looked intriguing, but in real life turned
into a nightmare. He thought he was being guided upstairs to the
emergency exit until he noticed the white wooden door which led to his
fortnight's resting place.
The bed was so tiny he remembered the Big Ears and Noddy wallpaper of
childhood. It is an odd experience going on holiday alone if you are not
protected by the self-image of exploration but are simply unpartnered,
childless, and trying not to look like an unloved loser. All this while
living in a room the shape of a pizza slice.
Trying to avoid being dependent on strangers is why most of us fall
into disastrous relationships or, sporadically lucky, fall in love.
Going on a package holiday by yourself is like trying to pre-empt the
old folks' home while creating its parallel. No anxiety, no danger and
the company of people you would rather be dead than talk to.
Most of my friends think me rather odd, well of course they would
because I find topless bathing horrendous. I only tried it once on a
Greek island but found myself unable to relaxedly converse with a male
stranger in the realisation that I had never before chatted
bare-breasted about the nice weather without intimacy having previously
occurred.
So a programe about the joys of naturism, and it was a good programme,
made me consider the relationship between sexuality and nudity.
The line most naturists take is that the honesty of bare flesh
denudes, as it were, the sexual aspect: which I'd always thought was one
of the main points of being on the beach. A Naturist's Sports Day (Radio
4) gave voice to the advantages and delights of allowing sun and air to
all parts.
It was quite interesting listening to people talking about the
liberation of taking off their clothes and allowed me to think about the
subject more objectedly, because any television programme on the subject
has always made me fall out of the bed laughing. Nude men wearing socks
and sneakers, and naked women making the tea wearing an apron just gives
me the giggles.
However, having frivolously said that, there was an account by a
divorced woman which made me a little ashamed of my response.
Having had a mastectomy, she said, any man she met made her fearful
that were she to get involved, this great confession would have to be
made -- walking around naked made her more comfortable, paradoxically,
because she felt that it was her true self she was displaying. ''If you
don't like it you can walk past.''
Good on you, I thought, still believing that I am no less near nature
clothed than not. Another man said he had never seen an erection happen
in a naturist context and my response was ''sounds like Butlin's of the
bare''.

As the cost of the Eurofighter soars above original estimates, James
McKillop highlights defence drains on the taxpayer
YOU have to hand it to the Ministry of Defence. When they get their
sums wrong, it is done on the grand scale. There are no half measures
for the mandarins of Whitehall.
The latest projected overspend on the Eurofighter 2000 is just the
latest example. It will come in at an additional cost of #2.2 billion to
the British taxpayer and the aircraft will be delivered three years
late. Any further delay might force them to change the name of the
aircraft, yet again.
There was a day when a procurement contract with the MOD was
meaningless. Nothing came in on budget. You are dealing with the sharp
end of technology and you cannot accurately gauge how costs will spiral,
was the usual explanation.
It was not one that cut much ice with Michael Heseltine when he became
Defence Secretary. He introduced a system of fixed-price contracts and
the bad old days of overspend were supposed to have been over. It has
not worked out that way as the Eurofighter fiasco has proved.
The excuse that dividing workshare in the project between the four
partner nations -- Britain, Germany, Italy, and Spain -- together with
the nations other than the UK cutting their requirements for the super
fighter, is not convincing.
It is clear that supervision of the sums being spent on the aircraft,
at a time all nations are reducing their defence budgets, has been
woefully lacking.
The message has been on the wall for some time. The all-party House of
Commons Select Committee on Defence pointed out the dangers some months
ago.
It had also highlighted how MoD mismanagement on a grand scale had
boosted the cost of the expansion of the Clyde submarine base at Faslane
in preparation for Trident by a massive #800m. It is a sum which now
seems quite small when compared with the additional cash being poured
into the Eurofighter project.
Defence chiefs were accused of overseeing a catalogue of errors at
Faslane and nearby Coulport which saw the cost of the project soaring to
#1900m.
The MoD took some comfort in the fact that the cost of purchasing
Trident missiles from the United States and building the submarines was
going to be less than projected.
Of course the overspend on that project in no way compares with
extraordinary dealings over Britain's early-warning aircraft.
With a great deal of pomp and ceremony, and not the slightest hint of
embarrassment, the Royal Air Force in 1991 finally took delivery of a
replacement for the museum-piece Shackleton aircraft which flew out of
Lossiemouth. Developed from the Lancaster bomber, the Shacks were aptly
described as 30,000 rivets flying in formation.
Until state-of-the-art Boeing E-3d Sentry Awacs (airborne warning and
commanding system) were delivered to the RAF the Shacks had been the
eyes of the nation looking out for a surprise attack from the then
Soviet Union.
It was back in 1977 that the RAF first recognised that it would
require a hi-tech aircraft to patrol the British Isles and warn of
impending air attack.
While 12 Nato countries opted for the Boeing E-3a Awac, Britain
decided it could not be ready in time for this nation's needs, so we
opted instead for British technology carried in converted Nimrod planes.
After spending #1000m on the Nimrod, whose systems could not
differentiate between low-flying aircraft and a fast-moving Land Rover,
the UK scrapped the project and decided to buy American instead.
It was to cost the taxpayer an additional #1000m, but it took us out
of the steam age into the era of star wars. That description does not
fit in with the sad saga of the Royal Navy's new Type 2400 Upholder
Class submarines.
The excuse for their demise was that, although they had to be scrapped
before being brought into service, they were surplus to requirement in
the post cold war era.
It sounds glib and it is glib. It disguises the fact that Britain
should never have got involved in the project in the first place. It was
a boat that was unlikely to have a serious role in the nation's defence.
The diesel-electric subs cost more than #900m and are packed with
state-of-the-art technology.
They were scrapped with the promise that funds would be made available
to the Royal Navy for a helicopter assault ship -- an order which has
brought work to Govan -- and two amphibious assault vessels.
A decision is expected soon by the Canadians on whether or not they
will purchase the four Upholder submarines and take them off our hands.
If they do, the price they will be charged will come nowhere near their
#900m-plus cost of building the boats in the first place.
Still, it would be another embarrassing procurement decision we can
forget about.
Just as we have already done with HMS Challenger, on which we spent
#211m. This was a top-secret hi-tech diving support vessel of which we
know little. In all probability it was intended to recover bits and
pieces from the seabed put there in the first place by the then Soviets.
It came into service in 1984 and was sold to a Scottish company at the
knock-down price of #2m. When it came into service it was a magic ship
that could do anything. In reality it was used only twice by the Royal
Navy -- once to recover chemicals from a vessel off Guernsey and to
salvage a Harrier jet lost in Lyme Bay.
Both operations could have been dealt with satisfactorily without the
involvement of such a sophisticated vessel. Which, of course, brings us
to the fiasco surrounding the procurement of Type 23 frigates.
The first seven vessels of this class have gone to sea without a fully
integrated command and control system. That is hugely embarrassing. The
ships will, however, be brought up to date when they come in for their
first refit.
It is said that these seven frigates can perform a hugely effective
role at sea even though the hi-tech kit on board is not working
properly. To the layman command and control on board a warship could be
vital. Still, the Navy seems satisfied and they should know their
business better than anyone.
At least on this occasion they don't have to pay the additional costs
involved. This was a fixed-term contract and the additional monies
involved will be put down to the contractors.
MoD procurement disasters will not end with the Eurofighter.
Under the leadership of Malcolm Rifkind the MoD selected Devonport as
opposed to Rosyth for refits for Trident submarines before it was
discovered that the Plymouth yard will require huge sums of money to
bring it up to nuclear safety standards -- if that is at all possible.
Potentially this could be another nightmare for the MoD mandarins. We
await decisions and explanations with interest.

* SHARON STONE has always been fast on the drawl but now says she's
even better with a gun; something of a raunchy Annie Oakley. As the
leading lady in her Western, The Quick and the Dead -- it opens in
Britain later this month -- which she also produced, she found her
skills improved.
Her instant fame since the phenomenon of Basic Instinct has made her a
target for all sorts of attention including deranged letter writers. It
was the sudden change in her status -- ''on Friday no-one knew me, by
Monday they were trying to break my car windows to get at me'' -- which
forced her to take advice on how to handle herself as a super-celebrity.
She talked with her family and friends and finally security advisers.
''I learned how I could sit in restaurants, how I could go to a movie,
how to handle myself at public events, which letters go to the FBI.''
Which letters go the the FBI?
''Everybody who's famous gets these letters. One of the same guys who
writes to me writes to Princess Margaret -- and we have a lot in common!
There are FBI people who can determine the psychological profile of the
writer. The letters don't get to me.
''I've always slept with a shotgun in my room. I'm a country girl. My
father is Mr 'Field and Stream' and when I was five I was shooting
bottles off tree trunks.
''I don't have a big moral dilemma -- if someone's in my house I'm
going to shoot them. And I have a good aim.''
Following The Quick and the Dead in which she stars as a lethal
gunfighter up against Oscar-winner Gene Hackman as a Devil-figure
shootist, she says: ''Since learning quick-draw my reflexes are
unbelievably fast.''
Deadlier than the male in more ways than one.
* BUT Stone is not nominated for a Golden Boot Award at tonight's
ceremonies at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. Burt Lancaster
will receive a posthumous honour and James Coburn will be there to
collect a boot for his work in films like The Magnificent Seven and
Maverick. Jane Seymour will get the Boot for her Dr Quinn, Medicine
Woman. Makes you wonder what Burt Lancaster would have thought of that
one.
* CHILD star Diane Lane has just turned 30. Not a dangerous age it
seems. She's a sensation in 'Wild Bill' Hickok opposite Jeff Bridges and
a new American television version of A Streetcar Named Desire. Diane
Ladd who has been around a lot longer -- since 1932 -- is filming Dennis
Potter's final work, Cold Lazarus, in London with Albert Finney. But
tomorrow the movie she wrote, directed, and stars in, Mrs Muck, debuts
at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Her co-star is former husband Bruce Dern
one of the cinema's landmark bad guys. They've kept close through their
daughter Laura ''Jurassic Park'' Dern who is married to Jeff Goldblum
who was married to Geena Davis who is now married to director Renny
Harlin who used to date Laura Dern . . .
* THE word on The Crossing Guard in which Jack Nicholson's cop is out
to avenge the murder of his son is so strong that there is talk of an
Oscar nomination for its director. It will be interesting to watch how
Sean Penn, the former Mr Madonna and general bad boy, will deal with
that mainstream attention. The other buzz is on Spike Lee's movie
version of Richard Price's amazing novel Clockers which examines New
York's black ghettos through the eyes of a white policeman.

Vladimir Nabokov v Edmund Wilson
ENVY is the gasoline which will feed any feud and few burnt so
brightly as between Russian author Vladimir Nabokov and the American
critic Edmund Wilson. The toy train over which both boys fought was
Nabokov's translation, published in 1964, of Eugene Onegin, a poem by
Pushkin. In a scathing attack in the New York Review Of Books, Wilson
attacked Nabokov then attempted to teach him in Russian grammar and
vocabulary. Wilson did concede, however, to liking the book's layout.
It was the culmination of 20 years of sniping. In 1945 Wilson wrote of
Nabokov's ''insatiable and narcissistic vanity''. As a wedge Pushkin had
pushed between them once before when Nabokov wrote congratulating his
friend on his poetry collection. He compared one to a old poem by
Pushkin. Wilson was convinced that Nabokov had made the poem up, to top
him, he never checked. Weeks later Wilson could resist no more and
discovered Nabokov had not lied.
Upon the Review's publication Nabokov cabled its editor: ''Please
reserve space in next issue for my thunder.'' His ''thunder'' crashed
down on eight errors in Wilson's Russian and English. The squabble
rumbled on with Wilson's defence hinging on the Nabokov's description of
a single Russian consonant. Yet Nabokov's erudition won out.
Though not before Anthony Burgess wrote: ''Small reviewers like me
scuttled out of the cross-fire and left it to the giants.''
The two men were never reconciled.

Scots actor John Hannah began his working life as an electrician but,
as he tells William Russell, he has found his niche in show business
SHOULD your son announce he wants to be an electrician, no doubt you
would think he had a job for life and was a sound, sensible laddie.
There is always a demand for someone who can change a plug or fix the
telly. But beware. Two swallows may not make a summer, but they indicate
something. No prizes for guessing one electrician turned actor --
everybody knows that is how John Gordon-Sinclair started out before he
became Gregory. The other, however, may come as a surprise.
John Hannah, Franky Drinkall in the highly successful televison police
series Into The Blue and films Four Weddings and a Funeral and the
forthcoming Madagascar Skin, directed by Chris Newby, also started off
knowing where to attach the red wire and the blue one, before finding
his vocation.
In Madagascar Skin, in which he co-stars with Bernard Hill, he plays
his second homosexual role on the trot. He is a young man who has a
large purple blotch on his face -- hence the title, since it resembles
the island -- with a severe personality problem. He runs away from his
life in London, ends up on a beach in Wales, meets Hill, who has been
buried up to his neck in the sand by some thugs, for reasons never
explained, and a strange and intense relationship is formed.
Was the 33-year-old from East Kilbride worried about being typecast?
''I don't feel if I play three heterosexuals in a row that I am going to
get typecast, so why should I worry? They were different parts, and it
is good doing something different,'' he said.
''Not that one should do something different just because it is
different if it is also crap. But there was something about the
originality of Chris Newby's writing that appealed to me. He is unique,
and the film is different from what a lot of people tend to go to see in
the cinema.
''There was also the chance to work with Bernard. It is important to
work with people you respect.''
Why had he become an actor? ''I wanted to change my job and a friend
at work said why didn't I try acting. I had never been to the theatre,
and I had never expressed any desire to act, but you don't need any
qualifications to get into drama school and, since I did not have any,
my other options were limited. I went to the Royal Scottish Academy and
that was it,'' he said.
I suggested that maybe theatre-going opportunities in East Kilbride
were limited, which was why he had never been to the theatre before
taking this decision to become an actor, but he disabused me of that.
Both Wildcat and 7:84 toured there regularly and the town had a
theatre. It was just he had never been inside one there or in Glasgow.
''That is the tradition we have in our family,'' he added. ''If you
are brought up not to go to the theatre, you don't go. It never occurs
to you to do so. You go to football games, you go to the pub instead.''
Hannah has lived in London's East End for the past 10 years -- in Bow,
which he said was handy for the West End, had neat, respectable little
streets and, above all, was cheap. He came south after finishing drama
school because, like most Scots, he had wanted to travel.
''I wanted to get out of Glasgow, to see something else of the world
after the metropolis of East Kilbride, and it seemed pointless to leave
Scotland for Manchester or Liverpool, although I have worked in both.
London was the place to go. But that does not mean I am a Scotland
hater.''
Four Weddings was not his first big break -- that was appearing in
Brond, followed by the next step, being part of the Royal Shakespeare
Company -- but it had boosted his status. He now had more scripts to
read and felt more comfortable about having a couple of months off
without any work. Four Weddings had not rocketed him into a different
world because his career had been slowly building up anyway.
''I feel more confident now that there will be work in the future --
having choice is the real luxury. I don't have kids, and I don't have
huge responsibilities, and to be able to choose between two scripts,
whether to work or not, is real luxury as an actor. There are things
lined up for later in the year.''
When first told about Into the Blue he had thought -- not another cop
show! But the cast was very strong; it had seven main characters each
with good story lines, and there was no side-kick, no ex-wife and no
classic car. It was more like the American police series Hill Street
Blues and NYPD Blue than a British one, he said. Shooting the series had
occupied four months and by the end all he had wanted was a break, time
to do ''some real living''.
The role, in which he has made a considerable impact, will have done
his career no damage and, since he was given a spectacular screen death
followed by an episode devoted to finding out why he had been murdered,
he has avoided the trap of being typecast when series two comes along.
As it will.
What other interests did he have? ''At the moment I don't seem to have
any,'' he said, after some thought. ''Work appears to be what I am
concentrating on -- while I can.''
Hollywood? ''If I do something there it will have to be a good script,
one I want to do; not a Disney one about a couple of prehistoric
monsters in Loch Ness.''
So Mrs Worthington, if you want to put your son upon the stage --
apprentice him to an electrician.

Alan MacDermid explains how DNA will revolutionise crime detection
THE words ''you're nicked'' have taken on a whole new meaning for
Britain's criminals with the first linkage announced yesterday of a
suspect's DNA profile with the national police databank.
A burglar need only cut his hand on a broken window, or a rapist leave
some skin under his struggling victim's fingernails, to risk being
matched up to the DNA at the database.
With the exception of identical twins, no two people have the same DNA
genetic code in their cells; the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham
has amassed 45,000 DNA profiles so far and are processing them at the
rate of 650 a day.
As the O J Simpson trial has demonstrated, however, DNA fingerprinting
is not the exact science people might be led to believe.
DNA -- deoxyribonucleic acid -- carries the coded instructions, or
genes, that decide what individuals are like -- from hair, eye colour,
and intelligence, to their predisposition to cancer, heart disease, and
mental illness.
Its structure was first discovered by Francis Crick and James Watson
at a Cambridge laboratory in 1953, and the means of obtaining a profile,
a sort of print-out of a person's DNA make-up, was discovered by
Professor Alec Jeffreys, a geneticist at Leicester University, in 1984.
He showed how DNA can be broken down into a pattern of bands, similar to
bar codes on supermarket products.
He has since predicted that DNA profiling will one day be able to
provide police with some description of their suspect -- ethnicity, eye
colour, hair colour -- even before they have caught him.
A sample of almost any body fluid or tissue can be used to get a DNA
profile -- including saliva, a hair root, a spot of blood or semen, or a
flake of skin.
But although each person's DNA code is unique, profiles are only a
snapshot rather than the whole picture, offering a highly probable, but
not definitive identification of an assailant. In some communities,
in-breeding can confuse the sample.
DNA fingerprinting is among the topics at a specialist course being
run for scientists from round the world at Glasgow University's
department of forensic medicine and science.
Research assistant Will Goodwin said: ''There are a whole number of
bands you can measure and if you measure enough you will get a profile.
Each band gives you a locus with a discrimination which can vary from
1:100 to 1000.''
There is a multiplier effect, so that two loci, one offering 1:500 and
the other 1:1000, would together offer 1:500,000. Add another band
offering 1:100, and you have fingered someone out of almost the entire
UK population.
But it isn't quite as straightforward as that. The multiplier can't be
used without taking account of sub-populations and ethnic groupings who
may have some loci which are linked more closely than normal.
''You have to put a factor in to account for this linkage,'' said
Goodwin.
The standard of proof will vary depending on how many points are
measured and what level of discrimination they offer.
For #38.40 -- the cost quoted for each of the samples being processed
at the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham -- you wouldn't get all
that many, Goodwin observed -- ''it sounds like a pretty minimalist
level''.
These variables explain why DNA scientists can't just step into the
dock and say: ''He did it.'' Instead, the case has to be based on levels
of probability which vary from case to case.
The way the resulting statistics are bandied about in court has made
DNA fingerprinting a controversial area.
Forensic scientists often quote huge odds against a coincidental
matching of two DNA fingerprints, which make juries believe that the
probability of the suspect's guilt is beyond all reasonable doubt.
For example, only one person in three million might share the match
between an accused and the scene-of-crime samples. That sounds
convincing until you look at the other side of the coin. Based on a UK
population of 51 million, that puts the odds against him being guilty at
17 to 1 -- some would argue that is hardly enough for a conviction
without some collateral evidence.
Glasgow's speciality is the profiling of degraded DNA; the department
has been working to identify the charred victims of a Romanian air
disaster, and some of the victims of the Pinochet regime in Chile.

<HEADLINE>Firm loses fight to open giant quarry</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CAMPAIGNERS were celebrating last night after the Scottish Office
rejected a controversial plan to site a giant quarry at a greenbelt site
in Renfrewshire.
Scottish Aggregates sought permission to extract millions of tonnes of
dolerite rock over 21 years from a 95-acre site at Windyhill Farm,
Elderslie.
Renfrew District and Strathclyde Regional Councils both rejected the
proposal but the company lodged an appeal to the Secretary of State for
Scotland and a public inquiry, lasting six weeks, was held in Johnstone
last year.
Objectors condemned the plan on environmental grounds, claiming the
estimated 65 heavy lorry movements per day in and out of the site would
damage the rural setting.
Now, the 100-page decision just issued by the Scottish Office has been
hailed as a major victory for people power.
Paisley MP Gordon McMaster, who spearheaded the long-running
anti-quarry battle as chairman of the local action group, described it
as ''a fantastic result''.
He said: ''The entire community was wholly behind this struggle. I am
absolutely ecstatic. It shows that people power can take on big business
and win.
''This has been hanging over the people of Johnstone, Elderslie, and
Foxbar for almost six years. There will be champagne celebrations this
weekend.''
The MP, who lives in Johnstone, said the long, drawn-out battle proved
there was a definite need for a change in planning procedures.
''It is unfair to put people through something which drags on so long
as this,'' he added.

Mary Brennan writes that literature ranging from tales of honey-eating
bears to Chinese recipes can train our tastebuds to crave food.
A is for Apple. Prophetically, our first bite into the alphabet primes
us for a lifetime of reading about food. Maybe you aren't one of those
comfort readers who devour cookery books at bedtime, knowing full well
they'll never stir nor strain anything more than their imagination.
Perhaps your own vocabulary doesn't favour phrases like ''See the
doughnut not the hole'' -- possibly not the most useful rallying call
for the cholesterol-conscious -- or that ultimate put-down to all
vegetarian politicians, ''Where's the beef?''
Without ever craving it, however, you will find it in almost every
genre of literature you scan. Nothing quite sets a scene like a
carefully-set table. Forget the notion that you can tell a man by the
cut of his clothes -- study, instead, what he carves, and how. And what
better way to conjure hard times than by pointing up the meagre pickings
of an impoverished diet?
In childhood, just as we're getting the taste of things into our head,
along come stories to give us special food for thought. I know adults
who only spread honey on their nursery toast out of loyalty to Pooh . .
. and how they wished he'd gorged on strawberry jam instead. I know
children who would guzzle Whiskas if Maisie, that idolised Kilted
Kitten, preferred it to fish suppers and ice-cream.
Our appetite for turning such fiction into fact was recognised -- and
celebrated -- some years back by the cookery writer Jane Grigson. She
selected various famous meals from books, and reproduced the recipes
alongside fascinating snippets of information about the writers or the
food.
The Water Rat's stupendous picnic (from Wind in the Willows), Nana's
Feast (from Zola's novel), a dinner from Jane Austen -- these I recall
with particular pleasure. The book, alas, is no longer to hand -- once
loaned never returned. It's all right, I understand.
Grigson, like Elizabeth David, made literature out of food. Recipes
were incorporated into a text that dealt either with the country of
origin or -- as with Grigson's glorious books on vegetables, fruit, and
fish -- the main ingredient. Anecdotes about different dishes would,
perhaps, describe the place where the writer had first tasted it. Or
maybe there would be a thumbnail sketch of the chef who had devised that
particular combination of flavours and textures. Whatever the details --
be they geographic, historical, culinary, or personal -- the result was
eminently readable.
It's this quality of readability and breadth of outlook that Claudia
Roden -- herself an expert in the field -- refers to when she says: ''To
me writing about food does not stop at the saucepan or the plate. It is
an occasion to write about people and their world.''
These days a cookbook is just as likely to read like a travelogue or a
social history or indeed a biogrpahy.
This year the Edinburgh Book Festival has decided to cater to our
needs with a special series of Food and Drink talks and demonstrations.
There will even be tastings!
On site, at Charlotte Square Gardens, a fully-working kitchen is being
built so that guest chefs can practise what they publish. Among those
taking part are Claudia Roden, Vatcharin Bhumichitr, and Marie-Pierre
Moine. Together they embrace a host of tastes from Thai cooking to
French cuisine as well as Middle Eastern fare. They are, in fact, a
three-course treat for Festival-goers since they are joining forces on
Tuesday for an afternoon of cooking and chatting.
Vegetarians -- and anyone who thinks veggies exist on lentils and
lettuce -- can pick up new ideas from Sarah Brown while those whose
choux pastry could double as shoe leather can hope to learn from the
lips -- and fingertips -- of Michelle Roux who specialises in
patisserie. There will be samples afterwards . . . And yet more samples
-- not to be sniffed at, but sipped as well -- when Alice King invites
you to check out the best buys in supermarket wines.
Local chefs from leading Edinburgh restaurants will fly (or possibly
fry) the flag in a Taste of Scotland weekend (August 19-20).
On the back of my first ever Chinese cookbook -- where each recipe
came with an intriguing history attached. The American publisher had
scrawled: ''Kissin' don't last, cookin' do''. Which you could translate
as meaning: ''When all those sex 'n' shopping novels have lost their
thrill, cookbooks will still make your mouth water.'' The proof of that
pudding awaits you at the Edinburgh Book Festival.

A REPORTER colleague, dispatched the other week to doorstep Celtic
Park, pointed out on his return that the football presenter from
Scottish Television had been sporting his new team kit -- blond
highlights in his hair, a tan the wife would die for, and a burnt-ocre
jacket from the very-loud-and-vulgar rack at Ralph Slater's, outfitter
to the stars.
Like the first cuckoo of spring, it was an early indication that once
again the soccer season is upon us. After a summer of golf, tennis,
cricket, and motor racing we can at last return to some real sport.
Rangers are back in Europe and Scottish Television is aye ready as
always to play havoc with the Wednesday night schedules. All's well with
our macho male world.
There now follows a health warning to all those television viewers --
there are millions and they're not all women -- who are ambivalent to
the great game. This is your last weekend. Your time is up. Next week
it's back to the gruesome twosomes: to Des Lynam and Alan Hanson, to
Hazel Irvine and Chic Young, to Saint and Greavsie, to Jim White and
Gerry McNee. Grandstand, Scotsport, Match of The Day . . . they're all
limbering up ominously on the sideline. The English League will be up
and running and, up here, the Coca Cola Cup (caffeine-free judging by
last year's unstimulating standards) will kick off.
The only saving grace is the fact that the return of soccer to our
screens usually coincides with the end of television's summer hiatus
(watch this space for details of forthcoming events . . . at long last
new dramas, new serials, new comedies).
But, for the moment, back to football which, as everyone knows, is a
funny old game. Very much a game of two halves. Makes you sick as a
parrot one minute and over the moon the next. It leads otherwise sane
men to acts of madness and brief appearances at the Burgh Police Court.
It has ruined more marriages than strong drink and scarlet women.
And football's even worse for those involved in its, well, execution.
To some of them it's more than a game; these days it's an opportunity to
make a fortune (or, if they get caught, to sign up for their local
prison team). Before the coming season is through, there is a fair
chance that several well-known players will be playing keepy-uppy in the
pokey. This fact has not escaped the notice of the television
scriptwriters.
If football truly is a funny old game then it was never more so than
in the hands of Andy Hamilton, stalwart Chelsea supporter and creator of
Drop The Dead Donkey. Now he's trained his cynical, not to mention
satirical, eye upon the not-so-beautiful game and written Eleven Men
Against Eleven, a stinging, laugh-a-90-minute comedy thriller about the
sorry state of English soccer to be shown on Channel 4 later this month.
It will, I assure you, be an early highlight to the season.
It is a simple tale of everyday football folk in a North of England
club, identified only as ''City''. The chairman is scheming,
manipulative, and corrupt. The Inland Revenue is sniffing around the
club's books (which are not so much cooked as burnt to a frazzle). And
the manager is sacked for taking a bung from a pre-season transfer deal
(#1[1/4]m for a 31-year-old Estonian? Who's he kidding?).
As if that were not enough, the goalkeeper has three
suspicious-looking Malaysian friends with a curious interest in how he
performs next Saturday. The top goal-scorer has been suspended for
taking a flying kick at the club mascot (a wee man in a penguin outfit).
And the centre-forward tests positive for marijuana . . . and cocaine,
amyl nitrite, heroin, LSD, and a compound which the Football
Association's chemist has not yet been able to identify.
Of course, if Hamilton had written this a year ago then we'd have
laughed the whole thing off as fantasy football league stuff. But that
was before: 1, Alan Sugar had his celebrated courtroom battle with Terry
Venables; 2, Paul Merson admitted having a drug-related nasal problem;
3, George Graham was sacked over bribery allegations; 4, Bruce
Grobbelaar and John Fashanu were charged in connection with match
rigging; and 5, Eric Cantona took the concept of audience participation
to its absolute limit. It makes you eternally glad to be Scottish; at
least we've only got mindless sectarian bigotry to worry about.
Now, thanks to the English soccer sleaze factor, there is a strange
ring of truth to Hamilton's script -- so much so that club chairmen,
managers, and players will no doubt watch it in the hope that they can
recognise, if not themselves, then each other. The boy Hamilton's done
well.
''Basically, I've tried to write a comedy drama about every problem
which has afflicted English football in the past two years,'' he
explained. ''Violent fans, mentally unstable players, drugs, bribery . .
. the lot. Last season was such an extraordinary season and that
extraordinariness made me want to write a piece about the game. The two
main characters, I suppose, are the two extremes in football.''
Sir Bob Luckton, Timothy West in fine comic form, stars as the
unscrupulous chairman of a beleaguered Premiership club which is skint
(''We couldn't be more in debt if Nick Leeson was treasurer'') and
threatened with relegation (''Cliff Richards has scored more often than
we have this season'').
When his manager is sacked for taking bribes, Sir Bob is forced to
appoint Ted Whitehead (James Bolam), the naive and idealistic youth team
coach, as ''temporary caretaker manager until we can find a permanent
caretaker manager''. Suddenly old Ted goes from teaching teenage players
how to run rings round traffic cones to facing up to ''the people that
really matter'' -- the tabloid sports journalists.
Bolam, endowed with old-fashioned values and the Corinthian spirit
(''Remember, boys, the ball is your best friend''), makes a vain attempt
to distance the players from the corporate and marketing side of the
game by banning their agents from the training ground. Meanwhile, a
stunningly-attractive tax inspector (Anastasia Hille), a
dyed-in-the-wool City supporter intent on ruining Sir Bob for ruining
her beloved club, is closing in for the kill.
Hamilton added: ''The thing is that, because marketing and commercial
priorities have become so important to clubs and the financial
imperative must always be to maximise the profits, some of the feeling
has gone out of the game.
''I've tried not to be too much of an old fuddy-duddy about it in the
script -- I don't want to turn out like one of my characters -- but
clubs nowadays are running the risk of alienating their hard-core
support when things get tough. It's all a bit tacky and sleazy.
''I suppose it's not so bad at the moment because the Premiership
clubs have been given so much money in television deals but that won't
last. Eventually, I think they'll have to fall back on the 20,000 idiots
who turn up every week and, when they do, I think they'll find that a
lot of them won't be there. In the long term, the game is in danger of
losing the fans.''
Given the subject matter, was there not a danger perhaps that certain
well-kent football faces not a million miles away from the characters
portrayed would take exception to the film?
Explaining that he'd gone out of his way to make the characters
''amalgams'' of real personalities, he said: ''No-one is based on any
one individual.'' Then he thought for a second before adding: ''But you
can't allow for paranoia; there might be people who think that certain
characters are based on them. But, let's face it, which of the 48
meglomaniac club chairman are going to sue?'' Well, probably only Robert
Maxwell -- and he's dead. Some player that Andy Hamilton.
* Eleven Men Against Eleven will be shown on Channel Four on Thursday,
August 31.
IN a week of programmes commemmorating the fiftieth anniversary of
VJ-Day, the BBC excels itself with a dramatised documentary about
Scotsman Eric Lomax, the prisoner-of-war who survived to track down --
and eventually come to terms with -- one of the men involved in his
brutal torture.
Lomax, a retired Strathclyde University lecturer from
Berwick-on-Tweed, spent years trying to exorcise the terrible ghosts
from his wartime past. His life twisted by the desire for revenge, he
eventually came face-to-face with the man responsible for his nightmare.
Only then was he able to bring his ordeal to an end.
Filmed in Thailand, Everyman Special: Prisoners of Time (BBC1,
Tuesday) was scripted by the internationally acclaimed writer of Death
And The Maiden, Ariel Dorfman, and his son Rodrigo. It features a
powerful performance from John Hurt as Lomax.
As an officer in the Royal Signals, Lomax was captured during the fall
of Singapore and forced to work on the infamous Thai-Burma Railway.
Accusing of drawing a detailed map of the railway, he was systematically
tortured by his captors. The men who tortured him changed shift but one
man remained constant -- Nagase Takashi, the military police
interpreter. It was his voice which Lomax could never forget.
After liberation, Lomax tried to put the past behind him, moving to
Glasgow to take up a lecturing post. But he was haunted by the memories.
After his retirement, he decided to search for the men responsible. The
search became an obsession which threatened his marriage. Then, through
an almost miraculous coincidence, he finally met Takashi, by now a frail
old man who was himself tortured by his feelings of guilt and remorse.
Also featured in the BBC's VJ-Day coverage is Enemy of Empire, an
exceptional and absorbing documentary about Subhas Chandra Bose, the
former President of the Indian National Congress, who misguidedly sought
independence for his country by aligning himself first with Nazi Germany
and then with Imperial Japan.
Unlike his contemporary, Ghandi, Chandra Bose believed that India
would only gain independence if Britain was forced out. After the
outbreak of war, the Oxford-educated former Indian Army officer, escaped
to Berlin where he tried to persuade Hitler to form a force for an
overland invasion of India. Hitler, who regarded the British Raj as a
model of white supremist rule, ignored his plea so Chandra Bose
travelled by submarine to Japan to secure the backing of General Tojo.
He became the commander of the Indian National Army (a force of Indian
POWs), declared war on Britain, and fought alongside Japan in Burma
until defeat in 1944. He was reported killed in a plane crash later that
same year.
After the war, three INA ringleaders went on trial in Delhi but were
eventually released thanks to a public outcry. Many believe that Chandra
Bose's actions -- he and his army virtually became national heroes --
helped to hasten India's move to independence in 1947.
If Hamilton had written this a year ago then we'd have laughed the
whole thing off as fantasy football league stuff

CABLE TV company United Artists Communications Scotland has stopped
screening Grampian programmes to subscribers in the Scottish Television
area after it inadvertently breached an agreement on live coverage of a
football match earlier this year.
Grampian had made an exclusive deal with the SFA to screen the
Pittodrie leg of last season's play-off matches between Aberdeen and
Dunfermline to decide which team would play in the Premier League.
The contract only allowed screening of the game in Grampian's
broadcast area but, because United Artists screens Grampian programmes
in the Edinburgh and Lothians area, the game went out live to cable
viewers there.
''It went out before anyone realised,'' said a spokeswoman for United
Artists at their Scottish HQ in Edinburgh. ''We were very concerned and
took immediate action as soon as we were notified by Grampian.
''We have decided to pull the Grampian programmes so that there is no
way a similar occurrence can happen.''
She added that on-screen notices were being shown to subscribers
informing them of the move.
A spokesman for Grampian Television said they had no agreement with
United Artists to broadcast the game. ''A problem arose where we had
exclusive rights to last season's play-offs.''
''We contacted them to alert them of this problem and the service has
since been discontinued.''

A DENTIST, who drugged and groped women patients in his dental chair,
was struck off yesterday after being found guilty of serious
professional misconduct at a disciplinary hearing.
Michael Evans, 28, drugged the women, including an 11-year-old girl
and her mother, and then put his hands inside their undergarments.
He admitted giving them up to three times the recommended dose of
sedative to knock them out.
Evans shook violently as General Dental Council president Mrs Margaret
Seward found him guilty of serious misconduct by assaulting Miss A, Miss
B, Miss N, and 11-year-old Miss C. He was cleared of indecently
assaulting Mrs D.
He refused to comment afterwards and left the hearing in central
London visibly shocked and swaying from side to side as he walked.
The hearing was told Evans was jailed for three months in March this
year by Stonehaven Sheriff Court for indecently assaulting Miss N. Evans
drugged the woman, put his hands down her trousers, then put her hand on
his penis after she regained consciousness.
In prison the dentist received notes threatening him and his family,
the committee heard.
According to a psychiatric report, Evans was prone to depression and
had ''seriously contemplated'' suicide.
Striking Evans off, Mrs Seward said: ''For the protection of the
public you will be struck off the register.''
Evans, who is married with a one-year-old baby, worked at two dental
surgeries near his home at Davidson Drive, Inverurie.
He assaulted an 11-year-old girl at his surgery in Broad Street,
Fraserburgh, on her first trip to the dentist. She had a number of milk
teeth removed under sedation to cure pains in her head.
She was groggy for 10 hours after her treatment and remembered being
touched under her bra and knickers by the dentist. The ''sexually
naive'' girl told her mother and grandmother she had been molested.
Her 31-year-old mother went to Evans a week later to have two teeth
extracted under sedation. Mindful of what her daughter had said, she
wore a high-necked top to deter any advances.
She earlier told the hearing: ''I took the precaution of wearing a
body suit with a polo neck and long sleeves.
''I remember the dentist with his hand on my breast and I recall his
hand going down the waist of my jeans.
''I either said or thought 'That's why I wore a body suit'. He started
kissing me and I felt his tongue in my mouth and his moustache. I went
home and said: 'My girlie wasn't dreaming'.''
Another patient, a 29-year-old married woman, sobbed when she told the
hearing of her ordeal at the surgery in High Street, Banchory.
She said: ''I knew he had his hands on my breasts. I knew it was
happening but I couldn't do anything about it.''
A fourth patient, an 18-year old, was indecently assaulted despite
being six months pregnant when she went to have a tooth capped.
Mr Evans admitted over-sedating five women patients and said it was
''extremely regrettable'' he had sedated the pregnant woman when it
could have harmed her baby.
He admitted an ''error'' in giving the women up to three times the
normal dose of the sedative Hypnoval.
He said he had inherited ampoules of the drug when he took over the
Fraserburgh surgery and did not check the correct dose. He regularly
gave patients up to 25mg of the drug instead of the recommended 7.5mg.
He said: ''With hindsight, it was an error. I was shocked when I
realised how dangerous it could have been.''
When police first confronted the dentist about the allegations, he
said it was a ''wind-up'' and blamed the drugs for giving the women
erotic dreams.
In cross-examination, Evans said his wife refused to have sex with him
after their baby was born in July last year.
He said: ''We had been having problems after the birth. My wife didn't
like physical contact later that year.''
Summing up, the solicitor for the General Dental Council, Ms Linda
Dobbs, said: ''Mr Evans has claimed the women misinterpreted standard
dental procedure.
''What dental procedure involves touching someone down below the
waistband?''

<HEADLINE>NHS trust pledges to safeguard jobs as it tries to make up #1.8m shortfall</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MANAGERS of a Highland health trust at the centre of a #1.8m cash
crisis yesterday told a meeting of staff representatives that jobs would
be cut only as a last resort.
A delegation from the Highland Communities NHS Trust said the cash
shortfall could be clawed back through savings in other areas.
It is understood their proposals include reducing transport costs by
leasing rather then buying vehicles and selling non-clinical property to
raise cash.
In the case of jobs, the first option would be delays in filling
vacancies, early retirement, and voluntary redundancies. Trust
management said patient care would not be affected by their plans.
Chief executive Mr John Hattersley rebutted claims that hundreds of
jobs could be lost. He added: ''The discussions were of benefit to all
parties. Management provided information about the trust's #1.8m deficit
and shared the trust's strategy for addressing this deficit with staff
representatives.
''Once again the trust emphasised that any job losses will not affect
the volume or quality of patient care. The trust will continue to
provide services to meet the plans of Highland Health Board for the
purchase of care in the Highlands.''
A statement from the joint staff consultative committee said:
''Management stated there will be no immediate job losses, however
redundancies were implicit in some of the proposals.
''It was confirmed that no redundancies will be announced until all
other alternatives have been explored, in accordance with existing
policy, and only after full and meaningful consultation with staff and
their representatives has taken place.''
Highland regional officer for the public service union Unison, Mrs
Gary MacLennan, cast doubt on the trust's ability to find the massive
savings required but said she would keep an open mind until management
provided more detailed proposals. She said the Scottish Office should be
approached to help fund the deficit.
Mrs MacLennan added: ''We find it totally unacceptable that jobs and
services can be put at risk as a result of an accounting mistake. We
also stressed that any job losses would have an impact on patient
care.''
A #1m financial error was made during the trust's negotiations with
the Highland Health Board. Auditors, who investigated after the
shortfall first came to light, then discovered an additional #800,000
deficit.
In a further embarrassment, former finance director Mr Alastair
Christie was sacked on Thursday after the trust upheld allegations of
harassment involving two members of staff. A member of staff has been
disciplined over the budget shortfall though Mr Hattersley has refused
to say if Mr Christie had been held to blame.

FOR many years I have used as my basic cooking manual Saulnier's
Repertoire de la Cuisine. It is a workman's manual, not a good read, but
concise to the point of terseness. Here is its recipe for one of my
specialities, Pouding Albert: ''1 lb butter, 1 lb sugar, 16 yolks, 1 lb
flour, 16 whites beaten stiff, 1 lb candied cherries, cut in dice,
custard, madeira''.
That does not tell you much, so you have to know what you are doing to
start with. I have in any event never spent what time it would take to
cut 1 lb of candied cherries in dice, but just throw them in whole. I
have never followed those quantities to the letter either, for they
would appear to yield a pudding weighing at least 4 lb, more than even I
could eat. But it has always turned out fine.
Well, my Saulnier is getting a bit battered now, its covers hanging
off, its pages defaced with notes of my own and spattered with
everything from cream to blood. So I am glad to get a substitute. I
wonder if a thick, and at first sight none too robust paperback, will
stand up to the same wear and tear, though the price of #12.99 makes it
by any standards a bargain. This is the distilled wisdom of Escoffier,
another of the great chefs of the century, in the service successively
of the Savoy Hotel in London, the Ritz in Paris, and the Carlton in
London.
The original version of the guide was published in 1907, and conceived
on a grander scale than we are used to now. Escoffier meant it as a
scientific account of the whole range of French cookery, on logical and
indeed historical principles.He carefully distinguishes preparations,
and is much concerned with the definitions: there are, for example, five
separate categories of soup. Altogether he gives no less than 5012
recipes.
He must have been to hell to translate into English, but the result is
a tribute to the industry of H L Crackness and R J Kaufmann. Their
collective perfectionism makes it in some ways more difficult to use
than Saulnier. For example, I take a great interest in the classical
sauces, and find it perfectly adequate when Saulnier tells me that Sauce
Robert is just Sauce Poivrade with the addition of mustard. In
Escoffier, you really have to analyse two whole sets of ingredients and
methods before you perceive this simple difference.
But the parade of dry detail is saved by the way Escoffier's
personality shines through. He was modest and methodical, but sometimes
burst out in little tantrums. He furiously condemns the fashion for
serving Tripes a la Mode de Caen in silver dishes -- the very thought!
But then he lived in another world: he gives, in gruesome detail, exact
directions for executing your own turtle.
The other world we live in is represented by the cookbook, already a
best-seller, for the two ladies who run the River Cafe, the most chic
restaurant of the moment in London. I have not eaten there, but it
obviously offers North Italian cooking of flair and distinction, if at
considerable cost. The same is true of the book.
But perhaps it is best just looked at. I start to get impatient when I
find the authors declaring that you must only ever use a special type of
cured anchovy from Italy. In fact this demand for certain items seems to
contradict the purpose of a cookbook. It is not so much to let us
reproduce exactly what we get in a particular restaurant. We can go to
the restaurant for that. It is rather to let us conjure up out of our
own, necessarily more modest, resources some dishes that are as good, or
almost.

THIRSTY Glaswegians seeking refreshment in the heatwave should turn on
the tap instead of buying bottled water, according to an official survey
published yesterday.
For district council officials have poured praise on the humble public
supply, declaring it of a higher quality than many of the trendy
designer brands found in the shops.
The council asked the regional chemist to make a chemical and
bacteriological analysis of tap and bottled water, and the result was
handed to the environmental protection committee yesterday.
''Glasgow's tap water is very, very good,'' gushed committee director
Mr Brian Kelly.
''Consumers of water in Glasgow can be assured that tap water was
found to be of a higher quality than bottled water. Therefore the
decision to drink bottled water should not be made for public health
reasons but simply on grounds of preference or taste.''
Glasgow's water comes from Loch Katrine, augmented by Loch Arklet and
Glen Finglas, via Milngavie waterworks.
The water is drawn off the reservoirs to towers where chlorine is
added to disinfect it, and orthophosphoric acid is added to combat the
adverse effects of lead pipes, which still exist in some areas of
Glasgow.
It then passes through polyester mesh screens into straining wells.
Finally lime is added to reduce the lead-pipe effect.
The bottled waters sampled in the survey included SPA Still (from
Belgium), Brecon Carreg Still (Wales), Evian Spring (France), Caithness
Spring (Scotland), Chiarella (Italy), Glendale (Scotland), Glencairn
(Scotland), Strathmore (Scotland), Highland Spring (Scotland), and Asda
Glenburn Spring (Scotland).
The survey prompted the bottled water companies to spring to the
defence of their products last night.
A spokeswoman for Highland Spring said: ''Any comparison made between
tap water and a natural mineral water is quite misleading because they
are two very different products. The legislation on tap water states
that you can add chemicals to it. A lot of consumers make a conscious
decision that they do not want to drink chlorine. If you buy natural
mineral water, there won't be any chemicals in it. We are not allowed to
do that.''
Mr Bill Paterson, managing director of Caithness Spring Water, said:
''We are a natural mineral water. That is constituted in legal terms.
The present natural mineral water standards represent the highest
possible standards.''
Those rigid standards laid down maximum levels for what could be
called harmful substances and required the water to be free of any
harmful bugs, he said.
''I would be surprised if the Glasgow water would meet the standards
required by the natural mineral water regulations. That is not to say
that the Glasgow water is bad or polluted in any way. I know that it is
excellent. But I would be surprised if it met these standards.''
Mr Bob Watson, production director at Strathmore, said its spring
water was also covered by rigid standards in UK and European
legislation.
''Part of what we are selling to our consumers is confidence in the
product's quality.''
Meanwhile, water companies in England and Wales warned last night that
creating a ''leak-proof and drought-proof'' supply system would at least
double customers' bills.
As the sizzling summer continued with no sign of rainfall on the
horizon for most of the country, the companies launched a vigorous
defence of their record, pointing out that only 5% of homes were now
subject to a hosepipe ban.
When there were similar weather conditions in pre-privatisation 1976,
every household was hit.
Earlier, Environment Secretary John Gummer defended the water
companies and insisted supplies were much better than in past droughts.

SALES of Scotland's ''sunshine products'' -- cameras, film, and
sunglasses -- have brought instant profits to Polaroid (UK) Limited.
Today the Vale of Leven-based company will throw a party for workers
and their families to celebrate receiving the Queen's Award for Export
Achievement for the fourth time.
Manufacturing director Mr Mike Fitzpatrick said 1994 was a boom year
for Polaroid.
Sales soared by #40m to #200m, 90% of which came from exports to more
than 100 countries.
''We manufactured more than five million cameras and more than 34
million packs of film, with more than one million cameras being shipped
to Russia alone,'' Mr Fitzpatrick said.
''This was a record for this plant. One in every nine cameras produced
in the world comes from this factory.
''We export more cameras worldwide than the total import of all types
of cameras into the United Kingdom.''
Mr Fitzpatrick said the company was also developing its burgeoning
sunglasses businesses.
''Scotland's fabulous weather has given us a boost,'' he added.
Brigadier Donald Hardie, Lord Lieutenant of Dunbartonshire, presented
the Queen's Award to Polaroid vice-president Ms Carole Ulrich from the
corporation's Boston headquarters.
''In the United States we are very proud of what's been achieved here
in Scotland,'' Ms Ulrich said.
''This facility is critical to the success of our worldwide operation.
The people here are hard-working, talented, flexible, and enthusiastic,
and I hope that the sun shines and they have a ball at the party.''

When it comes to fashion today's children know exactly what they want,
as Anvar Khan finds on a shopping trip with a trendy foursome
IN TOP GEAR
Clockwise from top:
Debonair in denim: Ross takes it easy in his Gap Kids Easy Fit jeans,
#16; Gap Kids denim blue shirt, #18; and Ralph Lauren polo shirt, #48
from House of Fraser.
Street smart: Lyn is right up with the fashion with her Ralph Lauren
baseball cap from House of Fraser, #30; Gap Kids denim shorts, #14; Gap
Kids white T-shirt, #12; and Gap Kids denim jacket, #26.
Simply casual: Gordon opted for a classic look in his Gap Kids Easy
Fit jeans, #16; and Gap Kids check shirt, #18.
Dogtooth days: Amy is ready for fun in her Dorothy Perkins dogtooth
check leggings, #12.99; and Dorothy Perkins dogtooth check wrapover top,
#17.99.
Pictures: PATRINA MALONE and ANGELA CATLIN
THE only way to decipher how children think and feel about fashion is
to ask them. It was begging for trouble, borrowing four children between
the ages of nine and 12, take them round the shops, and let them choose
an outfit each -- but it was the only way. They subsequently had to
justify their choices.
''This is a good day in town,'' offers Gordon Carrick, 10, as we
traipse from one children's store to another. ''Better than being
dragged round by Mum.'' His comment sparks off a debate regarding the
importance of parental permission.
''Dad only comes out shopping with me if I want a football strip,''
says Ross Montgomerie, 12.
''My Dad will only take me out for computer games,'' continues Gordon.
''My Mum says some things are too fashionable for me,'' confides Lyn
Donnelly, 10, a small, cute number whom I constantly fear I will lose in
the afternoon traffic. ''But I don't wear anything I don't like,'' she
adds, her twinkling eyes suggesting that any attempt might be more
trouble than it was worth.
''My Mum always tells me what she thinks,'' says Amy Baker, 10, ''but
she lets me choose my own clothes. If she thought an outfit was totally
disgusting I wouldn't be allowed it.''
''I have quite a big say in what I wear, but if Mum thinks it's too
expensive, I don't get it,'' Ross agrees.
''Sometimes my Mum goes out to buy clothes without me,'' confesses
Gordon. ''She goes into Marks &amp; Spencer deliberately when I want
something from The Gap.''
Stores such as C&amp;A had offered The Herald the facility of borrowing
gear, but kids have a definite idea of what they like. As soon as we
enter the aforementioned Gap, all four leave me behind like a starting
block. Designer labels are in, there is cool and there is uncool. ''Most
of the time the label is important, and The Gap is quite good,'' says
Gordon. ''It's my fashion.''
Gordon chose a checked shirt and jeans: ''I'd wear this outfit
anywhere. It's casual. I don't like dinner suits, they are for adults.''
At House of Fraser, Lyn chooses a Ralph Lauren baseball cap. The cost
-- #30. She shakes her head. ''I can see I'm not going to be getting
it,'' she laments.
''I quite like Frasers,'' Ross tells me, ''not the kid's department,
but the jeans, Levis and Calvin Klein. Partly because of the name and
partly because of the look. What friends think is important. Friends
think Levi jeans are better than Marks &amp; Spencer.''
It is not appropriate to patronise children who are behaving as
adults, as the assistant dealing with our order at Frasers quickly
finds. ''Go and look at the toys,'' she urges, as we hang loosely
around. Ross, Gordon, Amy, and Lyn are not impressed, and the invitation
is ridiculed. The Yamaha mini-motorbike too, was treated with instant
contempt. ''It only goes 5mph,'' says Gordon, authoritatively. ''Yes,
you probably have to plug it in,'' adds Ross.
The girls, meanwhile, are ignoring cute displays of rabbits and furry
bears to regale me with a litany of macabre ghost stories, such as the
one about a family friend, who was spooked by an apparition who made a
dent in the bed where it was lying beside her, in a hotel built on a
graveyard, in Marbella.
I heard all about the cottage haunted by a coal miner, its previous
owner, and the girl who kept a china doll under her bed, who woke up one
morning to find it had scratched her face to shreds. I was glad when it
was time to go.
''The price of Lyn's Ralph Lauren baseball cap is mad, really
outrageous,'' says Ross as we leave the shop. He adds: ''I got a cap
from Bally which is not cheap and it was #15. That doesn't even have the
label on the front, just USA.''
Lyn's outfit, consisting of denim shorts and a white shirt, was
subsequently appraised. ''My mum wears stuff like that,'' says Gordon,
''it's quite grown up.'' ''No, it's not,'' says Ross, ''it looks her
age.''
Ross felt there should have been more high street choice. ''I would
have preferred black jeans,'' he pitches, ''and a black denim shirt. The
Gap could have had half-a-dozen shades of blue.''
Amy, however, is content. ''I might wear this outfit about town with
Mum,'' she says, dreaming, ''or to a party or a disco.''

<HEADLINE>Liberal Democrats appoint Cunningham to working party on Scottish Parliament. Home rule saboteur's new role</HEADLINE>

THE politician who did most to sabotage home rule as a Labour MP in
the 1970s has been appointed by the Liberal Democrats to a
constitutional working party.
An unrepentant Mr George Cunningham, architect of the infamous 40%
rule in the referendum which effectively set back the cause of
constitutional change by a generation, insists that current plans for a
Scottish Parliament -- drawn up by Labour and his own Liberal Democrat
Party -- are doomed to failure once again because they still fail to
answer the West Lothian question.
''My views haven't changed, because they are so obviously right,'' he
said, adding that as for regrets, he had ''none at all''.
Given the strength and longevity of his party's commitment to a
Scottish Parliament, it is bizarre to hear someone deemed sufficiently
senior to be invited on to a working party, arguing forcibly against
home rule.
But Mr Cunningham said: ''I have never much believed in party policy.
People ought to think and reach conclusions for themselves.''
There is a further irony in Mr Cunningham's appointment to the working
party.
It has been set up to streamline and modernise the procedures of the
House of Commons and one of the stated reasons for doing this is to
circumvent any parliamentary guerrilla tactics by Tories resisting any
future constitutional change, such as the creation of a Scottish
Parliament.
The notorious guerrilla strike which Mr Cunningham was responsible for
was the so-called Burns Night massacre in 1978 when, as a Labour MP
opposed to devolution, he engineered a surprise 15-vote majority to
create the 40% rule for the forthcoming referendum.
This rule, by which not just doubters and tactical abstainers
effectively counted as no votes, but also those on the electoral roll
who died before the day of the referendum, eventually turned a narrow
victory for the yes campaign into a technical defeat.
Mr Cunningham said of the latest proposals for home rule: ''It is
basically the same as before and to have a parliament in Scotland
controlling most of the functions of government there, with Scottish MPs
carrying on voting on English affairs at Westminster, would be totally
fatal.''
What about the view of the Scottish Liberal Democrats that the
creation of a Parliament in Edinburgh could be the first step towards a
fully worked out federal arrangement for the UK?
''There are no first steps in that direction,'' he insisted.
''If there was going to be the logical federal arrangement with an
English Parliament, the English would have to get used to the idea --
and they haven't even begun to think about it.''
He accepted that a clear majority of Scots wanted devolution, but the
Dunfermline-born former Labour MP for Islington, who quit that party to
join the SDP, said: ''There are some things people want that they can't
have.
''The arrangement being proposed for Scotland wouldn't last. As soon
as the English had to have Labour legislation because of Scottish MPs
transforming the English majority, it would have to change.
Independence, on the other hand, is something which, if Scotland wants,
it is quite entitled to have.''
The question was put as to whether a Scottish Parliament established
after 1978 would have been able to cushion Scots from some of the
effects of the Thatcher era, and may even have lessened its impact in
England.
''Domestic arrangements within Scotland would have been better -- that
is undeniable -- and life in England would certainly have been better
without that Thatcher Government,'' he said, but he still had no regrets
about opposing a flawed scheme.
He dismissed the idea of English regional assemblies as ''daft'', and
said only the status quo, a full federal system incorporating an English
Parliament, or Scottish independence were viable and stable.
Scottish Liberal Democrats, Mr Robert Maclennan and Mr Archy Kirkwood,
will sit on the same working party as Mr Cunningham and will, no doubt,
be surprised to hear him declare himself ''unimpressed'' by the workings
of the Scottish Constitutional Convention.
SLD leader Mr Jim Wallace said: ''As regards constitutional reform,
George Cunningham is very much a lone voice in the party. However, as
far as House of Commons procedure is concerned, he has shown himself to
be an expert and we will be using this to our advantage.''

Jack Webster meets a man whose adaptation of a childhood story is
sending ripples of excitement through the literary world.
TIME ticks away for Alex Benzie, member of that student generation now
reaching its mid-30s which has drifted from one unlikely job to another
without any real hope of a career in sight.
His curriculum vitae takes him from a bit of voluntary work for
Glasgow University charities to a spell with the city cleansing
department -- and onward to a brush with community journalism, through a
mental health magazine.
For his livelihood, however, he still depends on Social Security, a
poor prospect for a man of 34 who is really too gentle a human being to
push his way into prominence.
Luckily, the point of salvation might well be round the corner, thanks
to the sheer talent of the man who had to brace himself this week to
face the public launching of his first novel, The Year's Midnight.
Superlatives are always a risk -- and up to this point the general
public has read not a word of Alex Benzie. But there is just a chance
that Scotland is about to produce one of its most significant writers in
many a long day.
The story of how it took five years to bring this near-600-page novel
to the bookshops is a tale in itself. But his Viking publishers in
London are now jumping up and down with excitement, encouraged by
several leading authors who are hailing the arrival of this unknown
Scot.
It is a long story. Alex Benzie, smallish, tubby, and with that
slightly quaint look which suggests an elderly parent (his father is
84), grew up in the Queenslie district of Glasgow and was educated in
the Roman Catholic tradition of the city.
More significantly, however, his father, another Alex Benzie, had come
south during the war from his native Banffshire, where he had a small
watchmaker's business. At home in Glasgow, he was always poring over the
mysterious mechanisms, with an eyeglass in place, observed by his little
son who gained his own fascination for the delicate timepiece.
But Alex Benzie brought more than his watchmaker's skills from the
village of Aberchirder, widely caricatured as Foggieloan. He would break
off to tell young Alex the legend of Macpherson the sheep-stealer, a
story well-known to any child brought up in the north-east of Scotland.
Sheep-stealing, of course, was once a hanging offence and the rugged
Macpherson was due for public execution in the town of Banff. Condemned
to death, he was nevertheless the subject of a pardon which was on its
way from Aberdeen by messenger as the hour approached.
That was when someone advanced the town clock by a few minutes to
ensure that the hanging would take place -- just as the riding messenger
came frantically with the reprieve. The mark of Banff's disgrace, as I
recall it, was that the town clock remained five minutes fast for years
thereafter.
Young Benzie picked up the threads of that story and, throughout the
frustration of his post-student years, began to weave it into the fabric
of a long novel.
A whole century after the event, so his story went, a local boy grew
up to be known as Watchie and to be called upon to restore, at long
last, the town clock which had been stormed by angry citizens when they
discovered what the local council had done.
By the early part of the twentieth century the reigning Provost had
reason to wish the name of Macpherson returned to good opinion -- but
Watchie found there were still strong currents in the community which
opposed a restoration.
With a powerful use of the English language, Alex Benzie drew his
characters into a compelling story, fleshed out with a north-east
dialect which, in my view, is the book's weakness. His knowledge of that
speech has come, clearly, at second-hand from his father but beyond the
Grampian cocoon I don't suppose too many people will pick up the
doubtful quality.
The London editor wouldn't have known. All that was known at the
Viking publishing house when sample chapters first arrived in 1991 was
that it was unusable in its present form, but that a rare talent was
lurking somewhere.
''About 18 months later I delivered the full manuscript of 900
pages,'' Alex Benzie recalls. ''The publishers now said they were very
interested but that I would have to do some rewriting. They felt that
part of the story went nowhere and I would be better without it.
''It was advice which I could accept or reject. But an editor called
Jill Waters was most helpful, suggesting where the cuts should be made
and providing a great deal of focus.''
Alex Benzie, who had studied English literature at Glasgow University,
wisely took the word of the professionals and buckled down to reshaping
his story.
Most of that work was undertaken on a word processor at his bachelor
flat just off Great Western Road. And when his novel was finally
accepted in December, Benzie knew that, at long last, he was set for
some kind of success in his struggle to establish himself in life.
The diffidence of the man was dreading the launching party at John
Smith's bookshop in Byres Road on Thursday night. It was the first time
most people had ever seen or heard of him. I would confidently forecast
it will not be the last.
Alex Benzie, who is now working on a second novel, set in his native
Glasgow, says: ''I hope I can now make a living as a writer. It is
something I have always wanted to do.''
There is an omen which hadn't occurred to him. His only previous
success in writing was when his short story came second in The Herald's
science-fiction competition, though it was not published. More than 40
years ago, another young man in Glasgow entered a Herald short-story
competition and came first.
His name was Alistair MacLean. And if Alex Benzie can achieve even a
fraction of the success which subsequently attended the Rutherglen
schoolteacher, his fame and fortune should go like clockwork.
* The Year's Midnight, from Viking at #16.
* The Edinburgh Book Festival has plenty of practical advice on
writing, getting published and promoting your work with various talks
and discussions by publishers and writers. For younger enthusiasts there
are workshop sessions on how to make your own books on August 26, 10am
and 11.15am.

* ''I do hate re-reading so I would prefer to take a new contemporary
book I hadn't read before. At the moment I read about three new books a
week. I can't be bothered with masterpieces. But if I had been forced to
go away last week I would have taken Pat Barker's new novel The Ghost
Road. It's published in September and it is so beautifully written. She
has such talent.
''But if a gun was placed at my head and I was asked to take away a
classic it would be Thackeray's Vanity Fair because it has such vitality
and that is what you would need if you were stranded. Plus there is so
much in the novel to analyse. You could spend forever examining the
themes.''
Margaret Forster, author of Mothers' Boys.

Alison Kerr discovers just what book styles can tell you about a
person and provides a guide on which titles can help create the best
image during the Festival
MAYBE you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but you sure as hell
can judge a person by their choice of book. Usually. Having worked as a
Saturday girl in a library for three years (don't judge a person by
their job title), I can confirm that in many cases you are what you
read. Women who passionately devour Barbara Cartland's all-too-regular
output tend to resemble the great dame -- all candy-floss hair and vague
memories of youth.
Sci-fi freaks are among the most easily identifiable. It's not just
their trademark greasy hair, nor the fact that they invariably have a
fetish for figures (of the numerical variety -- not the anatomical);
what gives them away are the anoraks and furtive facial expressions that
they wear as they lurk with intent in the direction of their section of
the library.
The more fickle followers of fashion, if they manage to read more than
their monthly quota of glossy magazines, apply the same selection
procedure to book-buying as they do to clothes consumption: the ''latest
is best'' principle.
If it's been reviewed in Elle, it's the book to be seen jutting out of
the pocket of your newest Armani acquisition.
Just as you can earn brownie points by resurrecting old accessories,
using your imagination and rebelling against the dictates of fashion
editors, those who dig deeper and put more independent thought into
their choice of reading reap their rewards in the street cred stakes.
Surely you'll impress your pals more with a book that none of them will
ever have heard of, let alone read, than with the latest bestseller.
And if your aim in life is to find a partner with the same tastes as
you, you can narrow down the potential by posing on trains, in cafes,
wherever, with a work by your preferred obscure author; hanging around
the relevant shelf in your library being just a shade too unsubtle and
not a little desperate. If the author is well-enough underrated, a
fellow fan will be drawn to you like a moth to the flame.
With all this in mind, here is a handy cut-out-and-keep guide for
style-conscious Bookfest-goers, for whom the paperback is this season's
key accessory.
What to wear with your literary accessory
* As our picture shows, marine blue and deep turquoise are the colours
to don as you pose around the Spiegeltent with your copy of Louis de
Berneres' Captain Corelli's Mandolin.
* Well-thumbed and yellowing paperbacks give the reader/carrier an
intellectual air which seems to be confirmed by the wearing of specs.
* Black and white, orange and white, green and white, royal blue and
white, yellow and white . . . in tribute to the 60th anniversary of
Penguin books.
* For the ultimate in Bookfest chic (not to mention cheek), read
Irving Welsh's Trainspotting, while sitting on your set of Louis Vuitton
luggage.
What does your book say about you?
* If it's an Oor Willie and The Broons annual, it's got to be:
''Jings!''
* If it's Margaret Thatcher's The Path to Power, it says that you're a
lonely, lonely Scottish person for whom street cred clearly isn't a
priority.
* If your taste veers towards the classical and you've opted for
Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd, you must be an Albion Rovers
supporter.
* If it's Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, you must be a member
of the SNP. Or possibly an Albion Rovers supporter. Or maybe even both,
in which case get a waterproof copy of Sylvia Plath's poems and head for
the nearest river.
Where to be seen in Bookfest City with your favourite book
* James Thurber and EB White's Is Sex Necessary? -- essential reading
at any Morningside bus stop.
* Splash by Eve Pollard, Joyce Hopkirk and Val Corbett -- an obvious
choice in any of the capital's alleged saunas.
* Roald Dahl's Lamb to the Slaughter in Auld Reekie's vegetarian hot
spot, Henderson's.
* In any city slimorama with a copy of James Hilton's Goodbye Mr
Chips.
Which book to read at the interval of which show -- the eternal
dilemma of the friendless festival-goer
* Carrie Fisher's Surrender the Pink at the Julian Clary show at the
Assembly Rooms.
* The Penguin 60s edition of Hans Christian Andersen's The Emperor's
New Clothes for any potentially pretentious piece of theatre or music.
In other words, one to have on you at all times.
* The Oxford Book of Exile by Bookfest author John Simpson -- for
those Fringe shows where you can almost certainly guarantee that the
cast will be playing to a party of one: you. And if you want to display
your sympathy for the company, the August Is a Wicked Month by another
guest at the Bookfest, Edna O'Brien, should strike just about the right
note.
* Hecklers who have exhausted all their usual repartee, could benefit
from the occasional peek at the ''put-downs'' section of festival author
Ned Sherrin's The Oxford Book of Humorous Quotations. But make sure you
keep it hidden under your seat, or else the joke will be on you.

From the safety of her Glasgow sanctuary, Ann Donald takes an
unforgiving look at the various festival types who have ousted her from
her native city.
BOOK FESTIVAL,
THIS literary indulgence is a bi-annual celebration of readings,
in-depth discussions, meet-the-author events, and cookery demonstrations
attended by a burgeoning number of enthusiastic and earnest readers
thrilled to meet, greet, and listen to their heroes and heroines. It is
also a jamboree for the London publishing world to leave their
Bloombsbury stables and enjoy a freebie networking Up North for two
weeks.
Habitat: Charlotte Square's Roxburgh Hotel bar, Jenners Food Counter,
the Spiegeltent's wooden booths.
Clothing: Ankle-skimming, flowery Laura Ashley skirts are popular, a
ruffled collar worn upright over a cashmere turtleneck and topped off
with a string of pearls. Shoes by Bally. Hairband and children called
Tarquin or Vanessa optional. For males a conservative suit or an
Edinburgh Book Festival sweatshirt if they're roughing it.
Overhead: ''Isn't that Salman Rushdie in the corner?''; ''Wasn't
Michel Roux's patisserie demonstration simply darling?''; ''Whir's thit
radge c*** Irvine Welsh? That Trainspotting man. It wis pure barry,
man.'' ''I believe you have the wrong night, sir. This is a Joanna
Trollope meet-the-author session.''
Accessories: Accent imported direct from Bloosbury Square or Edinburgh
New Town; A pristine copy of Joanna Trollope's A Spanish Lover; An
Edinburgh Book Festival plastic bag stuffed with politically-correct
children's books and a tub of pate from Jenners.
Three events you're bound to see them at: Irvine Welsh -- ''He's
frightfully colloquial and coarse, you know. But I've heard that he
captures the underclasses 'in situ' to a T.''; Claudia Roden -- ''She's
a mine of delightful ideas when it comes to those Middle Eastern dinner
parties.''; Joanna Trollope -- ''Simply unmissable through A Village
Affair was a bit risque, n'est ce pas?''
Ability to wind up natives: 3/10 because most of them are in fact
natives
COMEDY FESTIVAL
* THOUGH not an official festival by Edinburgh standards the powerful
triumvirate of the Assembly Rooms, Gilded Balloon, and the Pleasance
have quietly established a stranglehold as the prime comedy spots for
the TV famous, the hilarious and the budding hilariously famous to
flaunt their comedy wares in the vague hope that they'll a) get a better
time slot next year, b) secure a Channel 4 sitcom, and c) be nominated
for the Perrier.
Habitat: Press bars in the following venues: Assembly Rooms, Gilded
Balloon, and Pleasance courtyard.
Clothing: Comedians fall into two distinct categories: the downright
scruffy in distressed denims and rumpled T-shirt (hello Phil Kay and
Jeff Green) or there is the razor-sharp sartorially aware crew who have
their suits -- and in one case underwear -- made by comedy promoter
Addison Cresswell's own tailor (hello Rhona Cameron, Jack Dee, Lee
Evans, and Mark Lamarr). A smidgeon of hair wax completes the coiffed
look. Lily Savage is in a style league of her own.
Overhead: ''Are the Perrier people in tonight?''; To doorman at Gilded
Balloon: ''Let me in! I am a friend of Karen Koren's (premier Scots
comedy promoter at the Gilded Balloon); Famous person with Channel 4
comedy show to doorman: ''Don't you know who I am?''
Accessories: No self-respecting professinal comedian is seen without
an entourage that includes an uptight, Savile Row-dressed hype machine
that goes under the moniker of agent, promoter, or manager; Ego. I am
funny. I am; A Gilded Balloon Late 'n' Live Club card. Essential to
blag, blackmail, or steal to get one of these babies that guarantees you
the chance to schmooze and be schmoozed all night long.
Comedy shows you'll find them at: Women In Uniform -- Mel and Sue are
acerbic, cerebral, and serious young bucks on their way to fame,
fortune, and being very funn; Best Of The Fest, Part 1 -- With sartorial
suits Jack Dee and Rhona Cameron in attendance; Phil Kay -- the
classiest comedy scruff in the universe.
Ability to wind up the natives: 6/10 as long as they keep in their
secluded schmooze bars.
FILM FESTIVAL
* Older than Cannes, no less, and still attracting a pot-pourri of
chin-stroking cinephiles, nerds, film stars, shakers and makers, and the
general public to their virtually non-stop feast of film action, the
Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival is a prime spot for those pretentious
types who have got the air-kiss and the swivel-head syndrome (when you
see someone more famous than the one you're already engaged in
conversation with) down to a fine art.
Habitat: Drambuie Cafe/Bar, Cameo Bar, and the Traverse Bar.
Clothing: There's a choice here between the freebie film-company
T-shirts -- but only if they're this year's and from Cannes, sweetie --
and the fashionably unisex rumpled linen suit so that nobody knows
whether you've slept in it all night or not. Optional Nehru-style shirt
buttoned up to the top and a pair of Vans shades are essential for that
affected star status to be worn both indoors and out at all times --
except when you're watching the film, silly.
Overhead: Pompous director to overworked usher: ''What do you mean I
need a ticket? I'm a director, for God's sake!''; Affected nonchalance:
''Oh yeah, I just did breakfast with Steve (Martin)/Gabriel (Byrne).''
Film etiquette deems surnames unnecessary; ''I liked that (Nikita)
Mikhalkov film.'' ''Are you speaking on a metaphysical, intertextual, or
figurative level? ''Huh?''
Accessories: Half-eaten cheese roll -- this is due to being constantly
interrupted mid-mouthful because you've just spotted a potential
bankroller for your next project; Bulging plastic bag -- this is your
life for the next 15 days and it's full of drinks invites, press packs,
and unintelligible phone numbers on the backs of cigarette packets from
the party the night before; Delegate's Pass -- to be worn at a jaunty
(read stupid) part of your anatomy for attention seekers.
Films you'll spot them at: The Hunger Artist by home-grown talent
Bernard Rudden -- a black and white adaptation of Kafka's short story
with soundtrack by suitably sombre The Blue Nile; The Colour of
Pomegranates by gay, dead, Armenian director about the real and imagined
events in the life of an eighteenth-century poet -- what more could you
want? Gala Launch with Ken Loach's Land and Freedom.
Ability to wind up natives: 8/10 when they nab all the taxis in
Lothian Road.
FRINGE FESTIVAL
* THOUSANDS of Fringe performers descend on the streets, church halls,
and even outlying hills of Edinburgh in the name of artistic endeavour
every year to wow, amuse, and annoy the population, tourists, and
passing strays. Despite the dazzling diversity of performers certain
''types'' are endemic: 1) Richard Demarco proteges who boldly push back
the experimental boundaries and try the patience of their audiences; 2)
Oxbrige existential interpretations of Kafka's Metamorphosis usually
directed by one of Jonathan Miller's descendants; 3) the juggling,
fire-eating, sword swallower who zigzags in and out of crowds on a
unicycle.
Habitat: Inside, outside, behind the Fringe Office, Demarco European
Art Foundation, Teviot Bar.
Clothing: Type 1 wear something minimal -- eg, a white sheet (Marks &amp;
Spencer's 100% cotton) draped in an ancient Greek fashion; type 2 wear
something really crazy -- eg, a white T-shirt with their university
emblem and motto printed on it in Gothic script; type 3 wear patchwork
dungarees and major body piercing --  facepaint is optional.
Overhead:  ''It's a quasi-conceptual implicitly surreal multimedia
happening performed in felt that Richard compared to Joseph Beuys's
early exhibitions'';  ''The Pittenweem Herald and Advertiser said that
we 'showed potential'.'';  ''Jim Rose has asked me to join his circus.''
Accessories:  A translator for those tricky social occasions that call
for ancient Greek to be translated into English -- eg, the pub;  Map of
the outlying districts of Edinburgh where you and the rest of the
30-strong student cast are holed up in a B&amp;B;  Matches and paraffin to
perform your fire-eating stunts.
Three shows you'll find them at:   Antigone by Sophocles in original
ancient Greek by Theatriki Leschi at the Richard Demarco European Art
Foundation;  The Poster of the Cosmos and The Moonshot Tape by
Dimorphous Witchhazel;  The Fringe Sunday at Holyrood Park.
Ability to wind up natives: None.
JAZZ FESTIVAL
* NOW in its seventeenth year, the Edinburgh International Jazz and
Blues Festival liberally embraces everyone from Van Morrison to Martin
Taylor to gospel choirs. However, the Traddies, as they are
affectionately known -- the crew who prefer the stomping ragtime New
Orleans style to the weirdo experimental stuff -- still retain a high
profile throughout the Festival.
Habitat:  Out and about on the streets of Edinburgh following a jazz
float, Old Town Grassmarket pubs, and the Tron Ceilidh House.
Clothing:  Archetypal sartorial traddie icon is a cross between the
flamboyant excesses of George Melly and Mr Acker Bilk. Garishly striped
waistcoats, pointy Acker bears and bowler hats emblazoned with ''I Love
Jazz'' are favoured by males while females opt for flouncy long dresses
and N'Awlins style parasols.
Overheard: ''Why aren't Cleo Laine and John Dankworth on the bill?'';
''What's a patatonic minor run?''; ''What is it with these young un's
like Bunk Johnson that they insist on playing all the wrong notes?''
Accessories: A pint of real ale and a dry white wine for the laaydee;
an unlimited supply of ''I Love Jazz'' stickers to be handed out with
missionary zeal in effort to convert modern purists;  brass instrument
and pseudo French accent so that you will be mistaken for member of The
Hot Antic Jazz Band.
Events they can be spotted at:  Jamming session at the end of the
Mardi Gras parade;  jamming session at the end of Jazz On A Summers day;
any concert by Edinburgh's longest serving N'Awlins revivalists The
Lousiana Ragtime Band.
Ability to wind up natives: 2/10 -- Traddies are generally harmless
except when Mardi Gras stops traffic.
TELEVISION FESTIVAL
* FOR 20 years the Television Festival delegates have been descending
on the capital to talk shop about the state of one of the nation's most
popular pastimes. Largely this festival amounts to the denizens of
London's favourite meeja watering hole, The Groucho Club, SoHo, and The
Channel (as those in the biz refer to Channel 4) upping sticks and
moving en masse to Edinburgh to do the deals and meet and greet the same
people as they would in London, only in much more beautiful
surroundings.
Habitat:  George Hotel, Doric Bar, The Traverse Bar.
Clothing:  The TV fraternity are trying so hard to be in vogue yet
somehow they always manage to miss the fashion boat by being a few years
behind. Popular choice for females are Jigsaw for low-grade executives,
Nicole Fahri or Betty Jackson for those higher up, and ''a little man in
Portobello Road'' for others. Linen suits with T-shirts worn underneath
and cowboy boots or anything buckskin for males.
Overhead: ''Blah, blah, blah, Yentob, Yentob, Yentob, rhubarb,
rhubarb, rhubarb.'';  ''Marcus is definitely making the right noises.'';
''Buzz me at The Channel and we'll talk development.''
Accessories:  Motorolas for the has-beens and Nokia top-of-the-range
mobile phones for those on the up and up;  PSION personal organisers;
for women tiny Kookai-style silver rucksacks with nothing more than a
lipstick and a couple of grammes of cocaine inside.
Three events you'll see them at:  The prestigious McTaggart Lecture
given this year by the dentally-challenged Janet Street-Porter;  Michael
Fuchs giving the World View Lecture;  Any free launch they can
successfully lig.
Ability to wind up natives: 9/10 because of the pitch of their
voices.

Gavin Bell takes a ride to a land of fun, colourful characters, and
learning on the Book Bus.
IT IS not often that Christopher Columbus, Noddy, and Sherlock Holmes
get together at the Barlanark community centre. When they do, there is
magic in the air.
The wizards who conjured this unlikely gathering in the east end of
Glasgow appeared in a large, blue and yellow van with funny stickers on
it. To the delight of a gaggle of children from a local play scheme, one
of them was dressed as Postman Pat, and another as his cat, Jess.
Another zany day in the life of the Book Bus was about to begin.
It was the Scottish Arts Council's bright idea for a vehicle packed
with books, games, and strange characters to tour the country for a year
to stimulate interest in reading among children. Much more than a mobile
library, it is a kind of Magic Roundabout on wheels, breathing life into
characters from fairy tales and detective stories and science-fiction
adventures.
By the end of the year it will have travelled about 25,000 miles and
enchanted more than 17,000 children. The Scottish Book Centre, which has
been involved in the project as part of its ''Readiscovery'' campaign,
says it has been inundated with requests for the Book Bus to continue
serving remote communities with no ready access to libraries and
bookshops.
It is not only the children of crofting communities in Yell and South
Uist that have been swept into its realms of fantasy. On its recent
incursion to Glasgow, a tousle-haired wee boy in a football top wanted
to know if Noddy was on board. When his favourite storybook character
duly appeared and presented him with a balloon, the sparkle in his eyes
was worth every penny of the bus's running costs for the day.
''What we are trying to do,'' explains Margaret Houston, ''is to
instil a love of books in children, and get them into a lifetime habit
of reading. The Book Bus is just a bit of razzamatazz really, but it's
fun, and it seems to be working.''
Ms Houston, the children's services librarian for the east of Glasgow,
is about the only person on board, apart from the driver, who is not in
fancy dress. This does not diminish her audience's appreciation when she
acts as master of ceremonies on a nearby patch of grass for a game of
''book bingo'', in which characters such as Bambi and Rupert the Bear
take the place of numbers.
Meanwhile another party is boarding the bus in various states of
excitement: ''Look, there's dinosaurs . . . they've got Thomas the Tank
Engine . . . have ye seen they sharks?'' An earnest young bookworm in
wire-rimmed spectacles is informing an attentive group of smaller chums
how a dodgy pirate in a picture book makes everyone change into
monsters.
Another wee boy is swithering between books featuring Columbus the
explorer and Holmes the detective, and wants to know if either of them
played for Rangers. The girls are inspecting the Babysitters' Series,
with titles such as Kristy's Big Day and Mallory and the Ghost Cat.
The Monster Debating Society and the confused football fan are
silenced by a disembodied voice emanating from the bus's loudspeaker
system: ''The giant got the giggles, which was a problem, because he was
supposed to be dead.'' For the next few minutes, the plot of Cowardy,
Cowardy Custard unfolds from a tape machine to a captive audience.
A big attraction is The Book Wizard, a computer programme designed to
guide children to the kind of books that interest them. Thus John
Jacinelli learns, by responding to questions about his age (seven), and
his literary preference (magical world), that he should check out the
adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. Happily Sonic is found hiding behind
Alice in Wonderland, and is presented to John in exchange for his
library ticket.
Outside, Noddy aka library assistant Lindsay Weir is orchestrating a
chorus of yells of ''I love books'', and rewarding her choristers with
balloons and badges bearing legends such as 'Books are Magic'. Ms Weir
has a good sense of humour, which is just as well considering the
occasional indignities inflicted upon her by curious children -- such as
the little boy who poked her in the bosoms and inquired whether they
were balloons.
Ms Houston is still surrounded by a ring of bright eyes as the ''book
bingo'' reaches a climax. Two lucky winners who complete their cards
with Kipper the Dog are presented with trolls trailing streamers
declaring them to be book bugs.
It is not apparent whether any of the little people milling around the
bus will turn out to be another Graham Greene or Somerset Maugham. Nor
are any of them quite ready to read a Booker Prize-winning novel, but
the bus is a step in the right direction. Ms Houston is convinced it is
an effective tool in countering the culture of video games, and is
encouraged by the response of children in her area.
''I don't think we need be unduly worried about children losing
interest in books,'' she says. ''I've seen no evidence of that. On the
contrary, all you need to do is make reading exciting at the beginning,
and it seems to go on from there.''
An informal poll conducted by The Herald at Barlanark suggests her
optimism is well founded. The prevailing view is expressed succinctly by
Brian Parsons, aged nine, who says: ''Books are better than television,
because the ghosts in books are real.''
Perhaps the most touching tribute to the Book Bus comes from Lisa
Marie Watson, aged eight: ''It's lovely,'' she says. ''I wish it was my
bedroom.''

* A CERTAIN voice haunted Eric Lomax for years after the war was over.
It was the voice of an English-speaking Japanese soldier in the PoW camp
where Lomax was tortured. By an incredible coincidence, Lomax managed to
track down this interpreter and they met on the River Kwai Bridge to
begin a process of healing and forgiveness. These experiences have been
adapted for BBC TV and Eric Lomax will also be talking about them to
Mavis Nicholson at the Book Festival on Monday August 21.

A British PoW remembers the joy of release from a Changi prison camp
and reflects on the postive affects his years in captivity have had
during his later years in society.
AS A dove was the harbinger of the beginning of the end of The Flood
and a new dawn to old Noah long ago, so too for those of us made captive
after the fall of Singapore in February 1942, hope of release that had
waxed and waned with the fortunes of war elsewhere was made a certainty
from out of the skies above us.
Hope became certainty on November 5, Guy Fawkes Day, 1944, at around
11 o'clock in the morning just when I had gone to the washing place in
Changi Camp for my bi-weekly shave with my homemade cut-throat razor. I
glanced up and saw a vapour trail, very high and coming from the
north-west, a tiny silver aircraft leading it, and I resumed shaving.
But something was wrong, different about this aeroplane and I took a
longer and closer look.
Where at first I'd thought were only two vapour trails that merged to
become one there were in fact four trails quickly merging to become two,
then one. Almost at once a great shout went up: ''It's one of yours!''
quickly muted because of a Jap sentry nearby wearing a puzzled
expression as people poured out of their huts and peered skywards.
The aircraft disappeared in the direction of the docks and harbour of
Singapore, returning on a reverse course half an hour later without any
sound of offensive or defensive action. We were to learn much later that
it had been the first direct reconnaissance flight over Singapore.
No-one, not even Noah welcoming back his olive-leaf-bearing dove,
could have been given the certainty, the promise of release, that the
sight of that Allied aircraft gave to us that day -- which is why I can
recall it so well.
It was the beginning of the end of captivity and the Second World War
that finally came with the atom bomb that wiped out Hiroshima and
vaporised some half of its inhabitants -- it was my birthday, August 6,
and it probably saved the lives of me and my fellow POWs, for we had got
wind of a possible attempt to eliminate us in the event of a direct
Allied attack either on Malaya, or on Singapore direct. The second atom
bomb on Nagasaki a couple of days later was enough to bring home to the
Japanese hierarchy the consequences of continuing. Despite all the
maltreatment, all the horrors experienced on and off ''the railway'',
there was no burning desire for revenge -- the attitude of the general
British squaddie was ''Poor buggers, they've lost and are probably as
fed up as we are and only want to get home -- which they won't and we
will''. The recriminations have had to wait until today.
Many books have been written about the trials and tribulations of POWs
in Japanese hands. Mostly the stories of horrors seen or experienced by
those in Japanese hands are true but it would be a mistake to make out
that all was gloom, doom, and horror for I can recollect times playing
bridge, chess or darts, or play-acting when one could almost, but not
quite, forget where one was.
I recollect finding among the several thousands of prisoners in
Singapore, who foregathered one pleasant evening to mark the centenary
of our old school, Rossall. The ''menu'' of that pleasant occasion held
under a durian tree and signed by all those present hangs today in the
school's library. Last year, 1994, was the 150th anniversary of the
school's founding, graced by a visit from the Queen and marked with due
pomp and circumstance -- and gladness. Coming from the library after a
last glimpse at the menu card I'd contrived 50 years before and half the
world away, most of the signatories now gone, to join the throng waiting
to bid farewell to HM and the Duke to my amazement I found myself
standing behind an entire Japanese family. The son, a pupil at the
school accompanied by father, mother, grandfather, and two sisters
dressed in kimonos. I tapped the boy on the shoulder and wished him
well, at which he smiled nervously and bowed -- and why not? It is not
for me to visit the sins of earlier generations upon today's -- that I
leave to others.
There was not one of our surviving officers, 12 as I remember that was
not busting to get back to home and family and pick up life's threads
again however -- but it was not to be, not yet. Derek Robertson, our CO
on, I think, the fourth day after freedom had summoned all 12 of us to a
meeting and spoke to us: ''I know all of you are dying to get home as
fast as possible, so am I, but there's still a job to be done -- we owe
it to our men to take them home ourselves and not hand them over to
strangers. I've been in touch with Army HQ and got permission to take
the men back to Dehra (Our Depot in India), see them tended first then
back on long leave to Nepal after being brought back to fitness. I'd be
grateful if those of you who feel that for whatever reason you must
leave here as soon as possible you'd just let me know and I'll fully
understand.''
Not a person spoke or moved in a pregnant silence in which everyone
knew what everyone else was thinking but in which everyone knew what had
to be done. ''Fine, that's settled then,'' said the CO after it became
obvious that no-one was going to break ranks.
Finally, I have mentioned only briefly the toils, tribulations and
death that was life on the Burma railway -- the ''blood, sweat, and
tears'' evoked earlier by Sir Winston Churchill, for the building of it
is well enough told elsewhere. I would not wish to experience it again
at any price. But man's inhumanity to man is not new nor is it past, one
has only to open one's newspaper or watch one's TV screen to know that,
which is my personal reason for putting the past behind me while not
forgetting it.
One of the things that saddens me about, not VJ Day but its aftermath
is that we, the Allies, executed General Yamashita who made me captive
at Singapore, as a war criminal, this ostensibly for war crimes
committed under his command in the Philippines but in reality because
his army beat us fairly and squarely in battle in Malaya in 1941-42. So
far as I know no actual atrocity was laid at General Yamashita's door --
for me his hanging was less retribution than vengeance for having
bloodied the British nose. He was hanged because he was a good soldier
who had showed us up in a less than heroic light.
The other thing that arose out of VJ Day, albeit nearly two months
after I was set free in Singapore was that when my train laboured its
way after a 10-hour journey on October 21st, 1945 up to Platform 9 at
Glasgow's Central Station before expiring there, to keep a tryst, was
she to whom I had become betrothed more than five years before. Out of
adversity had eventually come hope, and out of hope, fulfilment -- but
what a journey!

THIS picture of two twentysomething women in a busy promenade is
remarkable. Not because the girl on the right has impossibly long legs
and not because her companion is her spitting image -- but because this
picture was taken in Sarajevo, hence the soldier on the left.
What is particularly striking about these women is the way they are
dressed. Clearly a great deal of effort has gone into their outfits, and
their significance is much more than aesthetic.
Just as Bosnia last year embraced an Edinburgh-organised festival of
cinema, and just as theatre companies continue to stage productions in
war-torn regions, the determination of these two women to behave as
normally as possible by dressing as well as they would in peaceful
circumstances stands as a symbol of hope for their country.
The girl on the right would appear to be wearing a man's tweedy
jacket, made feminine and fashionable by a narrow belt nipped in at the
waist.
This is the style that has been splashed across western catwalks and
fashion pages, but has not really manifested itself on our streets. Yet
here it is in Sarajevo.
Most women, however, would wear a skirt or trousers with it; but then
most women don't have skinny pins and this girl's obviously confident
and defiant attitude.
Her companion would blend easily into any European crowd of
cosmopolites, with her slinky split skirt and Chanel-type handbag.
Maybe fashion is the next art form with a role to play in the battle
of morale which faces the civilians of former Yugoslavia.

Moscow, Friday
RUSSIA today announced top-level talks with the United States to
co-ordinate peace plans for former Yugoslavia and said it would provide
what it called considerable humanitarian aid for Serbia.
A Russian Foreign Ministry official said Foreign Minister Andrei
Kozyrev would meet Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national
security adviser, on Sunday to map out peace moves.
The official told Itar-Tass news agency the meeting would take place
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Acting on instructions from President Boris Yeltsin, the Government
said Russia would send considerable humanitarian aid, including food and
medicine, to Serbia, the dominant state in rump Yugoslavia and a
traditional ally of Moscow.
Presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev said he was confident the
United Nations committee overseeing international sanctions against
Belgrade would not object to this ''hand of friendship'' to help Serb
refugees driven from Krajina by a Croatian assault.
''The President hopes that the initiative will be supported by the
world community because this problem needs major international
intervention and help,'' he said.
The first aid will be sent tomorrow.
Russia has followed the sanctions until now but Yeltsin, under
pressure from a big pro-Serb lobby in Parliament, recommended lifting
sanctions after talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in
Moscow yesterday.
France cautioned Russia today against unilaterally lifting the
sanctions, saying it would be a step in the wrong direction for peace.
The Kozyrev-Lake meeting emerged from a telephone conversation
yesterday between the Russian Minister and US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher.
Moscow and Washington had ''underlined the need to activate joint
efforts in the search for a political settlement of the Yugoslav
crisis'', a Russian Foreign Ministry statement said.
Yeltsin launched a peace initiative this week which included the talks
with Milosevic. Lake has been touring western European capitals to brief
leaders on a US peace plan.
''Moscow thinks that these two initiatives do not exclude, but rather
complement, each other,'' Interfax news agency quoted a senior Foreign
Ministry official as saying.
After his talks with Milosevic, Yeltsin called for a summit of the
leaders of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia to prepare for an international
conference on the crisis in former Yugoslavia.
Today, Moscow presented Yeltsin's proposal to the four other members
of the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia -- the United States, Britain,
France and Germany. Initial Western reaction to Yeltsin's statement has
been muted.
Washington and Moscow have sharp policy differences over the Yugoslav
crisis. Russia has condemned moves by US Congress to end the arms
embargo against Bosnian Muslims, pressed for an end to UN sanctions on
Serbia and disputes the US view that Croatia's offensive against Krajina
has helped the search for peace.
An unnamed Foreign Ministry official told Interfax the Sochi talks did
not herald moves by Moscow and Washington to carve up Bosnia.
''No plans are being nurtured either in Moscow nor, as far as we know,
in Washington for a partitioning of Bosnia,'' he said.
Meanwhile in Paris US and French officials wrapped up talks today in
search of common ground on a new strategy for ending the war in former
Yugoslavia.
A US delegation led by Mr Lake was seen leaving the Elysee
presidential palace four hours after the talks began, but the officials
declined to talk to waiting journalists.
The delegation earlier had travelled to London and Bonn.
British and German officials announced after their talks that they
would support the US plan though they would not discuss its details.
The Contact Group has had little success in pressing for a negotiated
settlement of the four-year-old Balkans conflict but President Clinton
said yesterday that developments in the region had created ''a moment of
real promise'' for peace.
* A French UN soldier was killed and a second injured today when their
armoured vehicle overturned on a supply route near the Bosnian capital
Sarajevo, UN officials said.
A third French peacekeeper was trapped inside the vehicle and it was
unclear if he had suffered injuries as well.
There was no indication the UN vehicle had come under fire on the dirt
track over Mount Igman, which lies within range of Bosnian Serb gunners.
British and French troops in the UN's Rapid Reaction Force have
deployed along the Igman route to protect aid convoys heading into
Sarajevo.--Reuter

FRESH evidence has emerged of human rights' abuses against Muslim
refugees fleeing the former Bosnian ''safe area'' of Srebrenica.
Reports by humanitarian organisations, including Scottish aid workers,
have fuelled the fury over claims that up to 2700 people were executed
and buried in a mass grave near the enclave.
An Amnesty International delegation which has just returned from
Bosnia estimated yesterday that as many as 4000 men may be missing, of
which 1000 were believed to have been detained after the fall of
Srebrenica last month. The Red Cross has put the number of people
unaccounted for at 6000.
The Amnesty claims were based on accounts of refugees now based in the
northern city of Tuzla.
Amnesty said the ''disturbing series of human rights abuses'',
including the detention of men and boys as young as 12, had been carried
out by Bosnian Serb forces against Muslims fleeing the town. It appeared
there had been no widespread policy of abducting women and girls
although evidence emerged of isolated rapes and sexual assaults.
But the organisation warned that reprisals, such as beatings and
evictions, had been carried out against Serbs in the Tuzla region as a
result of the fall Srebrenica.
Scottish development officer, Mrs Rosemary Burnett, called for an
international criminal court to prosecute war criminals in the former
Yugoslavia.
She said evidence gathered by the delegation -- which it is hoped will
be used to convict the perpetrators in an international criminal court
-- was consistent with reports of a mass grave.
Mrs Burnett said witnesses told Amnesty workers that men were
systematically shot. Others claimed the bodies of refugees were found in
a field with their throats slit.
''Witness after witness said that people had been taken away and have
never been seen since,'' Mrs Burnett said. ''The evidence the delegation
heard corroborates the findings of the US military personnel.
''It demonstrates the need to have an international criminal court to
bring the perpetrators to justice -- they should not be allowed to get
away with human rights' abuses of this gravity.''
Ms Nikkie du Preez, founder of Edinburgh-based group Bosnia Now, has
also recently returned from Tuzla. She delivered cash aid to the mayor
of the town and spoke to refugees.
She discovered no direct evidence to support claims of a mass grave
but spoke to many who had fled Srebrenica. One pregnant woman, she said,
had her foot amputated without anaesthetic. To add to her tragedy, the
Srebrenica woman then saw her husband held as a prisoner on Serbian
television. She has not seen him since. The mayor also reported how
about a hundred armed Bosnian Muslims, who had escaped Srebrenica, shot
dead three Serbs in a revenge spree in Tuzla.
Ms du Preez said: ''It was hard to see such suffering and not be able
to do anything but we will continue our work to try to help.''
Meanwhile, the United Nations is demanding immediate access to areas
of eastern Bosnia where US aerial photographs indicate separatist Serbs
may have dug the mass grave, a UN spokesman said yesterday.
The United States presented the photographs and supporting testimony
to the UN on Thursday.
''UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) is now taking immediate action to
gain access to Srebrenica,'' UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Chris
Vernon said in Sarajevo.
''We've been instructed quite vigorously to follow-up. We're going to
ask and protest as hotly as we can.''
He ruled out the use of force to get to Srebrenica but UN officials
said the prospects for negotiating access were slim.
''We have been systematically obstructed by the Bosnian Serbs from
visiting these areas,'' said Mr Mark Cutts of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees in Sarajevo.
''Of course we're very concerned about these latest reports which add
up to an even more alarming picture when we know there are already
numerous reports of atrocities in the area.''
The international Red Cross president said in Sarajevo on Friday he
believed 6000 Muslims were missing in eastern Bosnia but had no evidence
to support the US allegation of mass executions.
The Red Cross bases its estimate on extensive interviews with women
from Srebrenica and Zepa who made it to the safety of government lines.
Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic, who commanded the assault
on Srebrenica, has already been charged with war crimes by a United
Nations tribunal in The Hague.
* Giant RAF Chinook helicopters painted in United-Nations white left
Britain to help with the massive flood of refugees in northern Bosnia
yesterday.
The two twin-rotor helicopters left their base at RAF Odiham,
Hampshire, to fly to Croatia.
They will be used for humanitarian missions to help cope with the
thousands of refugees made homeless by the Croatian offensive to
recapture the Krajina region.

Sid, Serbia
WEEPING refugees sat by a disused toll gate on the border between
Croatia and Serbia yesterday, their future looking as desolate as the
dusty landscape.
''Our car caught fire along the way and we lost the few things we
had,'' said Dijana, a pretty 17-year-old who fled the rebel Serb
''capital'' Knin on the day it fell to the Croatian army.
The girl and her parents hitch-hiked on tractors until they found
themselves in a convoy under UN escort that brought them to Serbia along
Croatia's main highway, from the last Serb-held pocket in northern
Krajina .
''We had a goal up to now -- to get to Serbia. Now we have arrived, we
don't know where to go from here,'' Dijana said.
Tens of thousands like them were still trapped in Bosnia on roads
jammed with traffic. Aid workers say conditions along the way are
gradually worsening.
''We have had our first reports of suicides,'' said Josue Anselmo,
spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. ''People are
more and more exhausted and the potential for violence has increased.''
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates more than 150,000
people fled the Krajina and some 50,000 have already reached Serbia.
They have been bused to temporary shelter under police escort.
The ICRC said it would take another week for the crowd -- one of the
biggest mass flights in former Yugoslavia's four years of war and forced
population movements -- to cross to Serbia.--Reuter

OXFAM yesterday urged the Government to help lead the international
community in an effort to end the nightmare of northern Bosnia's
refugees.
Up to 200,000 people, mainly Serb women and children, have fled
Krajina following last weekend's devastating attack by Croatian
Government forces.
Oxfam's programme director in the former Yugoslavia, yesterday called
for the urgent unblocking of military and bureaucratic barriers which
are preventing emergency aid reaching the refugees. At an emotional news
conference, Miss Jovanka Stojsavljevic urged Mr John Major to ''please
do something'', after returning from the war-torn region late on
Thursday night.
Miss Stojsavljevic described the panic among the vast column of old
tractors and vehicles lining the route out of Krajina.
The columns were continually interrupted by breakdowns, causing waves
of panic to sweep through the terrified refugees -- many of whom were
shelled by Croatian forces as they fled.
She said: ''Many people on the road to Banja Luka have been refugees
before. These people, like many throughout former Yugoslavia, are
leaving their homes for the third or fourth time.

Washington, Friday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton used his veto today to short-circuit a
congressional move to end US compliance with the UN arms embargo on
Bosnia, saying that such a policy would make the war ''an American
responsibility''.
In a statement on the veto, which Congress is expected to try and
override next month, Mr Clinton said unilaterally lifting the embargo
would ''have the opposite effects of what its supporters intend''.
''It would intensify the fighting, jeopardise diplomacy, and make the
war in Bosnia an American responsibility.''
He said that if anti-embargo legislation that passed the
Republican-led Senate and House of Representatives became law, it would
prompt a withdrawal of UN peacekeeping troops, and cause the fighting to
escalate.
''If the Bosnian Government suffered reverses on the battlefield we,
and not the Europeans, would be expected to fill the void with military
and humanitarian aid,'' the Democratic president said.
He said the congressional measure would also undercut a new diplomatic
effort to end the fighting that is now under way ''and virtually
eliminate chances for a peaceful, negotiated settlement in the
foreseeable future''.
The president's veto message arrived at the Capitol late this morning,
a short time before the Senate joined the House in a three-week summer
recess.
By agreement between the White House and Congress, a showdown will be
delayed until early September.
The Bosnia arms bill was approved by the Senate and House by margins
exceeding the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential
veto.
But Mr Clinton's spokesman, Mr Mike McCurry, said the White House
believed some of those who voted against the administration would
ultimately support its position.
However, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, a strong opponent of
lifting the embargo, said if the situation in Bosnia worsens the veto
might not be sustained, and armed support could be provided for
Bosnia.--Reuter

Amman, Friday
US officials in Jordan are questioning high level Iraqi defectors who
hold key secrets to Iraq's military machine and the security of
President Saddam Hussein, diplomatic sources said today.
The two men are married to daughters of Saddam, who in his first
reaction today termed one son-in-law, Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel
Hassan, a Judas whom history would ''stone . . . as it did with others
and he'd rather die and not lead a humiliating life''.
Hussein Kamel headed the industry ministry and military
industrialisation and Western diplomats said he was responsible for
rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure destroyed by the 1991 Gulf War,
including procuring badly needed military spares.
Diplomats said that he could also fill in remaining gaps in the United
Nations efforts to understand the operation of Iraq's now-banned
military progammes in non-conventional weapons.
Iraq's former intelligence chief Major-General Wafiq Samerai, who
himself fled Iraqi last December and has set up base in Damascus, said
the Iraqi army was in confusion after the defections.
''Reports coming to us from Iraq indicate there is disorder and
confusion in the army and among the people, especially in Baghdad,''
said Samerai.
However Iraq scoffed at reports that the defections would undermine
the government in Baghdad.
''Hussein Kamel occupied an important position in the state when he
was part of it and loyal to it and its leader . . . when he betrays his
country and leader and flees he loses all weight and any influence in
the state's affairs,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said in a
statement to the Iraqi News Agency INA.
Diplomats said the defections were a serious blow to Saddam and the
London representative of one of the many exiled Iraqi opposition groups,
the Supreme Council for Islamic Resistance in Iraq (SCIRI), said a
crackdown on followers of the defectors had already started.
''There is now an arrest campaign against the followers of the two
defectors in Iraq,'' Hamid al-Bayati said.
In Baghdad, Aziz said the defections would not have any impact on
Baghdad's relations with the UN Special Commission disarming Iraq under
the Gulf War ceasefire.
The commission needs to be satisfied and report to the UN Security
Council that Baghdad has completely abandoned its weapons of mass
destruction before the UN can clear it to start selling its oil again.
Saddam said the aim behind Hussein Kamel's defection was to prolong UN
sanctions on Iraq and ''once (the enemies) get everything out of him he
will be thrown on the open road . . . together with those who preceded
him to treason and disgrace.''
The Iraqi president, who sent his eldest son Uday to Jordan yesterday
to try to get back the defectors, including his daughters Raghda and
Rana, dismissed any possibility of those who had fled harming the Iraqi
people.
Jordanian officials said King Hussein sent Uday away empty-handed
after a 10-minute polite but tense meeting.
President Bill Clinton said the king had shown real courage in
granting asylum and said he assured him the United States would stand by
him in any confrontation with Baghdad.
One diplomat in Amman, noting Saddam's recourse to drastic measures in
previous crises, said: ''I hope they don't do anything foolish.''
However Iraq's deputy prime minister described the possibility of Iraq
threatening Jordan as ''US hallucination''. ''This is mere nonsense,''
he said.
Diplomats suggested the defectors, after their 600 mile drive across
the desert in an impressive motorcade of Mercedes, would probably move
on from Jordan.
''I can't believe they will feel comfortable here,'' said one.
Atallah Bakri, a 32-year-old electrician and one of more than 30,000
Iraqis who have fled to Jordan since the Gulf War to escape hardship,
commented on Hussein Kamel: ''If he stays here, I expect Saddam would do
everything to kill him.''
In a statement issued later, Sciri said Saddam's eldest son, Uday, had
taken over security.
''Our sources inside Iraq reported that so-called Saddam Commando
forces' supervised by Uday Saddam Hussein are in charge of security in
Baghdad and other provinces in Iraq after the defection of Hussein Kamel
and Saddam Kamel to Jordan.
''They added that these forces armed with different kind of light and
medium arms are guarding the important positions in Iraq.'' - Reuter

AS one who claims to tread in the massive footsteps of General de
Gaulle, President Jacques Chirac should have a more acute sense of
history.
Yet, shortly before leaving for his six-day summer break last week, he
lashed out at his military and diplomatic advisers: ''It's incredible!
None of them told me that the fiftieth anniversaries of the bombing of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki would come just after the announcement that
France was resuming nuclear tests!''
It must have been the heatwave. President Chirac even admitted he had
been wrong in announcing the trials so early. ''I should have done the
opposite and started the testing without telling anyone and explained to
them afterwards,'' he said.
By using his presidential prerogative of resuming nuclear testing in
the South Pacific atoll of Mururoa between September and May, in
defiance of the international moratorium of 1992 which France had
initiated, Mr Chirac hoped to impress his determination and
single-mindedness on his allies and countrymen alike. He must have been
inebriated by his recent election. For instead, he has unsettled public
opinion at home and degraded France's image throughout the world.
President Chirac's brief holiday in the South of France may cool his
temper, but it will not change his mind. For Hirochirac, as the world's
ecologists have nicknamed him, would only lose face if he steps down
now. He could not restore his damaged credibility.
The comment by Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama at the
ceremony marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb, that
the nuclear trials by China and France were regrettable, was the
cruellest cut of all. Until then, the president's advisers had dismissed
foreign protest as that of ''urchins and underdeveloped nations'', as
one of them put it.
French commentators think that last Thursday's announcement that
France will stop all tests next year after signing the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty has appeased the Australians. But it has failed to
satisfy European ecologists, who see in it nothing but a hypocritical
sop.
President Chirac was evidently unprepared for the hostility of French
public opinion: the ecological lobby is tiny, but more than 60% of
people, according to a recent poll, want the government to reverse its
nuclear test decision. People have little confidence in nuclear experts
who deem the Pacific tests to be perfectly safe and who only a few years
ago lied blatantly about fall-out from Chernobyl arriving in France.
President Chirac seems seriously out of step with his age. Even his
predecessor, President Mitterrand, already a little old and tired but
aware that the Cold War was over, had argued in 1992 for a reduction in
France's nuclear forces. Trusty right-wingers are arguing the need for
France to keep tyrants at bay -- Korea was quoted as a possible future
foe by one such commentator.
His fundamental argument is not that shaking the Mururoa Atoll to its
coral roots is necessary if France is to remain ''a great power'', it is
the Gaullist dream of grandeur, all over again. Maybe the general's
inheritor finds it difficult to cope with another reality, which is that
of a minor power, surrounded by friendly European allies.

Washington, Friday
PRESIDENT Clinton has ended all American nuclear tests. In a decision
announced today, he said the US would sign ''a true zero- yield
comprehensive test ban treaty''. He hopes that the treaty can be
concluded next year.
The United States had reserved the right to conduct small underground
tests in order to maintain the safety and effectiveness of its nuclear
arsenal. The president said today that other means would achieve those
ends, but established an annual report on the nuclear arsenal to monitor
its effectiveness.
The Pentagon wanted to reserve the right to test, but was mollified by
the assurance that a clause in the proposed treaty would allow the
United States to invoke ''supreme national interest' and resume tests if
the nuclear agencies determined that tests were essential.
The President made his announcement in the week following the 50th
anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and while
continued controversy surrounds the proposed French tests in the
Pacific.
The treaty will eventually have to be ratified by the Senate, and may
face serious opposition there.

THREE British tourists were killed and five seriously injured when
their open-topped jeep collided head-on with another vehicle on the
Spanish holiday island of Fuerteventura.
A total of nine Britons, including two families, were travelling in
the four-wheel-drive Nissan Patrol vehicle when tragedy struck. A
spokesman said the jeep was legally carrying all nine passengers.
The three dead were named as Charles Clarke, 53, and his daughter
Victoria, 22, from Hull, and Patrick Savelio, 40, from Nottingham.
The crash happened when their vehicle had a puncture and veered across
the carriageway smashing into another jeep carrying six Spaniards
travelling in the other direction, killing a Spanish woman. A Foreign
Office spokesman confirmed the incident, which happened on Thursday
evening near the small town of Antigua in the centre of the island.
Civil guards were slow to identify the victims as many of them had been
travelling without documents.
The driver of the Nissan, who was injured but not killed, was
36-year-old John Attwood, who was born in Nottingham.
The seriously injured Britons were Rosalind and Nicky Savelio, 36 and
10, and Christine and Rachel Clarke, 46 and 20. Thirteen-year-old
Timothy Savelio was less seriously hurt.
Two Spanish men and a 10-year-old girl, all members of the same family
as the dead woman, Guadalupe Curbelo, were also badly injured and her
two children were being treated for light wounds.

ISRAEL and the PLO cleared major hurdles today to expanding
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and said they would work towards
a final deal.
''We can say we have now an agreement but we still have some points
left for sub-committees to continue,'' PLO chairman Yasser Arafat told a
joint news conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
The sides agreed on security, the biggest obstacle, but failed to
agree on the future of Hebron -- a West Bank town with militant Jewish
settlers in its heart -- Palestinian elections and water allocation,
negotiators said.
Officials close to the negotiations said the United States had offered
to host the signing of the finalised agreement in Washington on
September 6, after Labour Day, but there was no confirmation of the date
by either Israel or the PLO.
The two sides initialled a two-page ''joint statement'' after five
days of talks at Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba.
It gave Arafat's Palestinian Authority wide administrative powers but
limited its responsibility for security in some 420 West Bank villages
ahead of elections for a governing council.
The PLO and Israel are more than a year late in extending self-rule to
the West Bank under their 1993 peace accord.
''We agreed that rural areas will include most of the villages, about
420. Administration is in Palestinian hands and security is in our
hands, with long-reaching instructions beyond the DOP as to our security
authority,'' Peres said.
Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said tat the PLO was insisting
that Israel withdraw from all populated areas in the West Bank before
Palestinian elections could be held.
''There will be no elections under occupation,'' he said.
Further Israeli army redeployment from parts of the West Bank
uninhabited by Palestinians but excluding Jewish settlements would be
carried out in three-stages, six months apart, the joint statement said.
It did not mention the six of the seven main West Bank cities, which
Palestinians and Israelis have said would be transferred fully to
Palestinian jurisdiction.
Israeli negotiator Yoel Singer said the accord gave Israel the right
to maintain control in the West Bank except for the six cities.
''Don't forget that we are talking now about redeployment out of six
towns. We still have some 500 other places, including towns, cities and
villages,'' Singer said.
Outside the main towns, Singer said, ''we are talking about shared
responsibilities, not joint but shared.
''They (the PLO) will be responsible for public order of Palestinians.
We will be responsible for the overriding security responsibility for
the purpose of protecting Israelis and confronting the threat of
terrorism.''--Reuter

THE chief executive of the company which produces Rangers whisky has
become the latest fan to take up the Ibrox club's invitation to pay #1m
to become an associate director.
Rangers chairman Mr David Murray said he was delighted that Mr Bill
Thornton, 54, of whisky giants Burn Stewart Distillers, had taken up the
offer.
Mr Thornton's company blends and bottles Rangers whisky, gin, and
vodka.
His company put up the #1m to pay for his honorary position as it
believes there are a number of good commercial spin-offs available from
their chief executive taking up the post.
Mr Thornton, a life-long Rangers fan, is the second person to be
appointed as an associate director by the club. The other is Edinburgh
haulage contractor Mr Ian Russell who was appointed five months ago.
The club said it had plans to approach only two other people in the
near future.The position carries no voting rights or boardroom powers.
The appointments are believed to be for a fixed-term but the prospects
of associate directors moving on to full directorships have not been
ruled out.
Yesterday Mr Murray said Mr Thornton's appointment would be good for
the club and made good business sense for his company.
He hit back at those people who thought Rangers were getting money for
nothing from such deals.
Mr Murray said: ''This is invitation only and Mr Thornton was
approached by the club. It makes good business sense for him to take up
the offer.
''It annoys me that some people who think we are getting #1m for
nothing. His company will get a good return on his investment by way of
a range of things involving the club.''
Mr Thornton, who was unavailable to comment on his appointment, is
chairman and chief executive of the Barrhead-based company which blends
and bottles whisky. Among their products is Scottish Leader whisky.
Mr Thornton led a management buy-out of the company in 1988 and
successfully floated it on the Stock Market in 1991. It is the third
largest independent whisky company in the country, employing 170 people.
Burn Stewart's managing director, Mr Ian Bankier, backed up Mr
Murray's view that the associate directorship was a good business move
for his company.
Mr Bankier said: ''We have had an association with the club for a long
time and that association was the platform on which the success of the
Scottish Leader brand has been based.
''We have had a box at Ibrox since 1989, have had trackside adverts at
the stadium, and our products have been put into the stadium bars.
''The invitation to become an associate director was to Bill
personally and the company put up the money to pay for it because we
believed it made good commercial sense for us to do so.''

THE Duke and Duchess of York were flying out to southern Spain
yesterday for a week's family holiday with their two children but royal
sources played down talk of a reconciliation.
Their stay at a luxury villa in the Sotogrande area of the Costa del
Sol is thought to be the first foreign holiday they have taken together
since they split up.
The couple have always made a point of spending as much time together
as possible with Princesses Beatrice, seven, and Eugenie, five.
Buckingham Palace said speculation about a reconciliation was only
''guesswork''.
A spokeswoman said: ''The Duke and Duchess of York are having an
entirely private holiday in Spain.
''They remain the closest of friends and in the interests of the
children they spend as much time as possible together as a family.''

ACTOR Hugh Grant was yesterday fined #120 for speeding at 98mph in his
Mercedes car.
The 34-year-old star of Four Weddings and a Funeral broke the 70mph
limit on a dual carriageway in Devon in April while he was in the county
to film Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson.
He did not appear before Exeter magistrates yesterday but pled guilty
by letter.
The court heard that a speed camera recorded the actor's
L-registration black Mercedes as travelling at 98mph at Kenford, near
Exeter.
Magistrates were told that Grant, of Redcliffe Square, Chelsea,
London, had two drink-drive convictions in 1985 and 1986.
Grant was fined #120 with #25 costs. His driving licence was endorsed
with five penalty points, taking his total to 11, one short of an
automatic driving ban.

AN Inverness jobs agency is calling on telephone watchdogs to pressure
British Telecom into cutting phone bills.
The Government-backed Highlands and Islands Enterprise wants
long-distance call penalties removed from BT's charge system. That would
mean one charge for all telephone calls across Britain.
The agency said digital exchanges have made it simpler and cheaper for
BT to connect calls across the country so long-distance charges were no
longer acceptable.
Mr David Henderson, the agency's head of projects and research, said:
''It is a crazy situation at the moment. There are 30 exchanges in the
Highlands which means we get charged long-distance rates for calls which
are sometimes only 15 miles away.
''In Greater London, with its 10 million people, there is only one
charge which means you can phone from Kent to Essex for the same price.
It is very unfair.''
Agency staff say the growth of tele-services such as video
conferencing and the Internet will make the Highlands uncompetitive in
the wider market.
The agency has sent a written submission to Oftel outlining its
concerns and asking for a charge reduction.
Oftel has asked for a submission of ideas as it conducts an assessment
of the whole framework of telephone regulation.
BT's Ms Jane MacFarlane said local-call areas in the Highlands were
expanded in 1993, providing a centralised local rate for island
communities.
''We are committed to providing a high-quality service across the
country and are willing to speak to Highlands and Islands Enterprise,''
Ms MacFarlane said.
Ms MacFarlane said maintenance costs in the Highlands were very high
given the remote location of some areas.

A BROTHER and sister branded the Blobbies because they are so
overweight were jailed yesterday for keeping a frail old lady as a
slave.
Seven-stone Dorothy Miller was forced to wait on John and Joan Evans,
who rationed her food, allowed her only one cup of tea a day and made
her pick up their dogs faeces with her bare hands.
John Evans regularly beat and kicked the woman, who had once nursed
their mother, and threw buckets of water over her. He encouraged the
four dogs to bite and scratch the 66-year-old widow.
Evans, 29, and weighing 28 stone, and his sister, who is 39 and weighs
29 stone, sat and watched videos at their home in Lambourne Way,
Tongham, Surrey while Mrs Miller, who they had invited to live with them
so they could spend her housing allowance, did the housework.
She was given hardly anything to eat, sent to bed at 8pm, and not even
allowed up to go to the lavatory.
Mrs Miller was too terrified of the huge couple to escape and even
pretended to visitors who saw her bruises that she had accidentally
fallen.
She was finally rescued after neighbours who had heard her screams and
seen her bruises alerted police and social workers, said Mr David Perry,
prosecuting, at the Old Bailey.
He said the prosecution accepted John's pleas to false imprisonment,
causing grevious bodily harm and assault, and his sister's admission of
assault, to spare Mrs Miller having to relive her ordeal in court.
She is now being looked after in sheltered accommodation.
But she still bears the scars of her beatings, her vision is blurred
because of John's constant punching of her head and she walks with a
limp -- the result of his pushing her down the stairs and breaking her
ankle.
He and Joan laughed as she lay in pain and he refused to allow her to
seek medical help, the court heard.
Mrs Miller is still terrified John will come and find her and cannot
sleep properly.
After the case, Detective Constable Simon Humphreys said: ''Those two
kept her as a slave. She is still terrified of John and frightened of
everybody now. She wouldn't even see a male doctor on her own at
first.''
Jailing John for three years and Joan for nine months, Judge Henry
Pownall told them: ''To see the photos of the state you put her in
before someone mercifully reported it, is nothing short of nauseating.
''In your separate ways I believe you are devious, cunning and in some
ways ruthless, and not in the least averse to exploiting the
vulnerable.''
The couple, who tried to hide their faces from photographers as they
waddled into court, now live at Caswell Close, Farnborough, Hampshire.

A CUP reputed to have inspired the legend of the Holy Grail has been
found in the loft of a house in the Midlands, according to an amateur
historian.
The remarkable claim about the two-inch high green onyx goblet is made
in a book published next week by Dr Graham Phillips.
Coventry-based psychologist Dr Phillips, 41, said the ''relic'' is
owned by graphic designer Victoria Palmer, 24, of Rugby, who thought it
was a Victorian novelty.
He is convinced the cup is the Marian Chalice found by the Christian
Roman empress Helena inside Christ's sepulchre and used by Mary
Magdalene to collect Jesus's blood.
In medieval legends about King Arthur and his pursuit of the Holy
Grail, the cup was said to have been used by Joseph of Arimathea, who
buried Jesus, to collect the blood.
Anyone who drank from it was reputed to become immortal. Later legends
claimed it was the cup used by Christ at the Last Supper.
Dr Phillips said: ''I do believe it is what Helena thought was the cup
used to collect the blood and is the one that inspired the legends and
stories.
''It just looks like an egg cup -- it could be a Victorian fake
someone made for a bit of fun, but if you are going to make a fake it's
more likely to be an elaborate chalice and not something like this
little cup.''
The British Museum has told him it is similar to a first century Roman
scent jar.
Dr Phillips traced the chalice's history and found it was brought to
Britain when Rome was sacked in 410 AD, according to the fifth-century
historian Olympiodorus.
It remained in the possession of the powerful Welsh kingdom of Powys
and was referred to by a Welsh monk in 1100, who said it was owned by
the heirs of the last Powys king.
Dr Phillips said a later descendant of the same family, Shropshire
businessman Walter Langham, claimed to have found the cup hidden in
Hawkstone Park near Shrewsbury in 1920.
The cup is owned by his great-granddaughter, Ms Palmer, who has stored
it in a bank.

NEIGHBOURS saved the lives of a woman, her four children, and her
boyfriend yesterday when a suspected arson attack set their home ablaze.
The rescuers were alerted by screams for help from the three-bedroom
council semi in Brockworth, near Gloucester, where Mrs Dawn Bick, 38,
her boyfriend, and children were trapped upstairs with the ground-floor
alight.
Neighbour Mr Steve Trinder, 32, a painter and decorator, said he raced
to the blazing house where he and another neighbour, Mr Stuart McIntosh,
found a ladder. Mr Trinder climbed it and pulled two children out before
going back for the mother.
Mrs Bick's boyfriend and two other children escaped by leaping from
first-floor windows on to a mattress.
They were all said to be ''very comfortable'' in Gloucestershire Royal
Hospital.
A police spokesman said the blaze was being treated as suspicious.
* Two children were yesterday still fighting for their lives after
suffering severe burns in a house fire in Wrexham in which five other
youngsters were killed.
Ms Mandy Davies, 33, and her fiance, Mr Dennis Deverey, 63, who
escaped before the fire service arrived, were both ''stable'' at Wrexham
Maelor Hospital.
Sarah Foulkes, 12, and 18-month-old Heather Davies were both in a
''critical'' condition at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital.
* A three-year-old girl died yesterday in a house fire in which her
18-month-old sister was seriously injured.
Fire crews were called to the blazing council house in Manston Garth,
Hull, yesterday morning.
Two adults and a boy escaped from the house.

<HEADLINE>Local people to bid for estate as Knoydart goes on market</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976928963</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Knoydart estate on the west coast of Scotland, one of Europe's
last genuine wilderness areas, is back on the market.
As first revealed in The Herald, it will be advertised for sale later
this month with a price tag of #1.5m.
The decision means that, once again, the future of one of Scotland's
most famous estates has been thrown into doubt.
But this time Knoydart's 50 inhabitants are determined to stop the
estate, which lies on the remote peninsula between Loch Nevis and Loch
Hourn -- Heaven and Hell in Gaelic -- falling into the hands of a single
incoming landlord.
After centuries of friction between successive lairds and tenants,
mismanagement and even ancient atrocities, locals are demanding a say in
the running of the 17,200 acres of wilderness.
''Under private ownership it has been an unhappy story,'' the
secretary of Knoydart Community Association, Mr Bernie Evemy, said
yesterday.
''In the past, there has been no investment. The place was
asset-stripped and none of that money remained in Knoydart.
''There has always been a conflict here between the owners and the
rest of the people -- historically as well.''
Now the community association has joined Highland Regional Council and
several environmental trusts to form a charitable foundation, which will
bid for the estate.
Mr Evemy said: ''For the first time in history we will be able to
dictate our views and the community will feel it's got a stake in the
estate.
''We would like to see more people living here with young families but
how we do that will have to come out in a feasibility study. In the
past, every new owner has created his own mini clearance.''
Mr Evemy said he hoped that even if the foundation did not manage to
buy the estate, it would still be strong enough to force its views on
any new landlord.

TWO men and two women were killed yesterday when their light aircraft
crashed and burned, barely missing houses and a playground.
Residents said the pilot of the four-seater, twin-engined plane
appeared to struggle with the controls as the plane came down in a field
near Andover, Hampshire.
The American-made Beech 95-58 TC Baron had taken off from Thruxton
aerodrome, Hampshire, on a pleasure trip to Deauville in northern
France.
The pilot, a London businessman in his 40s, had contacted the Thruxton
control tower to say he was returning to land because a door was open.
He was accompanied by his wife, a French linguist, and two friends.
Witnesses believed the pilot tried to steer the stricken plane away
from houses. The aircraft crashed in a fireball just 50 yards from
houses and the wreckage was described by ambulancemen as ''just a pile
of ashes''.
Ms Sandra Baybutt, a 40-year-old mother-of-two, said: ''It flew over
our two houses and straight into the field opposite, just a few yards
from a children's play area.
''It was a miracle there were no kids out in the field. A couple of
yards closer and the plane would have hit the playground.''
Mr Richard Boyd, who climbed a tree on the edge of the field shortly
after the crash, said: ''I could see a man who was pulling at his
seatbelt, desperately trying to get out.
''But he was too late. I lost sight of him when the plane went up in
flames.''
Chief Inspector Frank Connor, of Andover police, said: ''We do not
know if the pilot was trying to avoid the houses but if he did then he
is a hero.''
A spokesman for the airfield said: ''At the moment the whole incident
is clouded. We haven't got a clue why the aircraft crashed.''
Mr Brian Preston, director of the Remoteassist company of Salisbury,
Wiltshire, which owned the aircraft, said the pilot had been flying the
plane for more than two years.
He had become a friend since he started hiring the aircraft on a
self-fly basis.
''I know they were planning to fly to France for the weekend. They
would have travelled down from London this morning to pick up the
aircraft from Thruxton,'' he said.
''The man who hired it had flown many hours on the twin-engine
aircraft and in particular this type of plane.''
Mr Preston said the plane received a certificate of airworthiness a
month ago and went on a training flight on Thursday evening.
''As far as we know there was nothing wrong with the plane at all. It
is not unusual for a pilot to return to the airport if the door is
discovered to be open, because it is impossible to shut them in flight.
''But there is no reason why a plane should crash just because the
door is open.''
Representatives from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch visited
the scene and will publish a report on the crash.
* The Baron is made by the Beech aircraft company of Wichita, Kansas.
More than 2000 have gone into service since production began in 1969.

<HEADLINE>Howard hails 'major breakthrough' as police prepare to arrest suspect traced on DNA database. Historic first for genetic fingerprints</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

POLICE hailed the dawn of a new era in crime detection yesterday as
they prepared to arrest the first suspected criminal in Britain to be
traced by DNA ''genetic fingerprinting''.
The suspect, for a burglary in Derbyshire, is the first to be
identified using the new national DNA database.
Senior officers described the match as a ''major breakthrough'' and
said the genetic database could soon be helping to trace suspects on a
daily basis.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said the database was the most
significant scientific advance in crime-fighting since the introduction
of fingerprints. He added: ''The database is great news for most of us
but seriously bad news for criminals.
''My message to the criminal is simple: DNA can catch you. Criminals
must realise that the chances of getting caught are increasing all the
time.''
Derbyshire Assistant Chief Constable Don Dovaston, the officer in
charge of the database, predicted that DNA profiles were set to become
as reliable as fingerprinting. However, the civil rights campaigners,
Liberty, expressed concern that the use of the database would lead to
wrongful arrests and prosecutions.
Mr Dovaston said the burglary suspect was identified after blood left
at the scene was matched with a database saliva sample on Thursday
night.
Since April 10, police have been allowed by the Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act 1994 to take samples from anyone being questioned in
connection with a recorded crime. About 45,000 samples are currently
being processed at the database's Birmingham laboratories, at a cost of
#38.50 each.
Because of financial constraints, police are currently using the
technique only in cases of offences against a person, sexual offences,
and burglary.
Mr Dovaston said of the impending arrest: ''It is a major breakthrough
which heralds the coming on-line of substantial enhancements in our
ability to implicate or eliminate suspects.''
It is hoped the database will have up to 135,000 samples by the end of
the year and ultimately as many as five million.
Mr Dovaston said: ''All police forces at the moment are looking at
outstanding undetected crimes, including murders and rapes, and we're
now looking to see if we can get any material from those past crimes
which can be enhanced by scientists to be compared against the
database.''
However, a spokeswoman for Liberty said: ''DNA evidence is very
useful, but it must not be taken to be the only evidence.
''Many scientists are expressing concerns about the foolproofness of
DNA profiles. Now not only is the accuracy of DNA under the microscope
but the accountability of databases is being questioned.
''We are worried that errors -- especially human ones -- could lead to
the wrong people being arrested.''
Asked about the possibility of miscarriages of justice, Mr Dovaston
said: ''I think we will find that a DNA profile of a person will
eventually become as good as a fingerprint.
''We're not at that stage yet, but I am convinced that there will be
no miscarriages of justice through DNA profiling.''

AN 18-month-old baby who stabbed herself twice in the mouth with a
used hypodermic needle at a hospital is to undergo Aids and hepatitis B
checks.
While her sister was being examined in aroutine visit to Dunoon and
District General Hospital, Ashleigh MacVicar crawled across the floor
and found the open box of used needles..
Before her mother could snatch one of the needles from her grasp, the
toddler had jabbed herself.
Staff at the hospital could not administer an anti-hepatitis B
injection after the event and Ashleigh was taken by ferry to Inverclyde
Royal, Greenock.
Ashleigh's parents, David and Margaret MacVicar, were last night being
comforted by counsellors experienced in dealing with stress and trauma
victims. They are now considering suing Argyll and Bute NHS Trust over
the incident.
Mrs MacVicar had taken Ashleigh and her four-year-old sister Jennifer
to the hospital for eye checks when the incident occurred.
At first Mrs MacVicer said she was ''worried, angry, and shattered''
by the whole affair, but later she said she could make no further
comment on the matter as it was now in the hands of her solicitor, who
had asked her not to speak publicly about it.
Argyll and Bute NHS Trust confirmed they were aware of the incident,
but refused to comment until the results of a full internal inquiry were
known.

A PRAYER to Sophie Hook from her older sister, Jemma, echoed the
feelings of mourners at her funeral yesterday.
The handwritten tribute, recalling the joy seven-year-old Sophie had
brought to so many before her life was cut short, was printed with a
colourful montage of family snaps on the order of service.
Nine-year-old Jemma's words were written beneath a photograph of
Sophie.
The prayer read: ''Sophie, my precious little sister, I am missing you
dearly. I know you will always be with me. ''When I look at pictures of
you over the past seven years I hope you will look at them with me.
''All the happy times I spent with you and will spend with you I
enjoyed and will enjoy.''
The prayer was signed ''To Sophie, love from your ever-loving older
sister Jemma'' and ended with six kisses.
Jemma, barefoot and wearing a red dress, accompanied her parents Julie
and Chris Hook, brother Joseph, five, and sister, Ellie, 21 months, and
other family members.
They sat in an oak pew at the front of the church and listened to
tributes to Sophie, whose body was found on a shingle beach at
Llandudno, north Wales, 12 days ago after she disappeared from a tent in
her uncle's garden.
Almost 350 people filled St Mary and All Saints parish church in Great
Budworth, Cheshire, where the family lived.
Mr Hook, 37, a sales manager, was one of the pallbearers for the oak
coffin which was covered in flowers.
Mourners filled the picturesque church to hear glowing tributes. The
Rev Derek Mills said Sophie's name meant wisdom. Nearly 3000 years ago,
King Solomon identified wisdom as the source of all happiness, he said.
''Everyone who knew Sophie spoke of her happiness and the happiness
and joy which she brought to everyone around her,'' he said.
''We all know that it is not a name which gives such characteristics
as Sophie possessed. It is the care and love which good parents lavish
upon their children.''
Paying tribute to Mr and Mrs Hook, he added: ''They are themselves
such loving and caring people. And indeed they are so because of the
love of their own parents.''
He recalled how Sophie and her family had worshipped together on the
Sunday before she died. ''We will always cherish that,'' he said. Mr
Mills also thanked the police from North Wales and Cheshire for their
''loving care and gentle efficiency in this situation''.
Sophie's class teacher, Mrs Dorothy Strange, paid tributes to Sophie's
talents at school, along with her personal qualities.
''She had an insatiable appetite for books, story poems, and
especially things which made her laugh,'' she said.
The service was followed by a private burial ceremony in the parish
churchyard.
A 30-year-old man has appeared in court charged with Sophie's murder.

Jack Skilling writes that 50 years after the horror of war in Burma
ended, the memories are still vivid to many Scots who fought the
Japanese in hellish conditions and lost comrades in battle and in prison
camps.
AS WE commemorate the end of the war in South-east Asia and remember
those who did not come home, memories of the early disasters are fading.
The war began disastrously in Hong Kong which surrendered on Christmas
Day, 1941. Singapore, after stubborn resistance, surrendered on February
5, 1942.
Troops sent to support the garrison in Singapore landed to learn that
the Japanese had almost complete control of the city. A few days later
they were prisoners of war, some without ever firing a shot.
Then followed Hell on Earth for the 2nd Battalion of Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders and others retreating from the advancing Japanese
who had swept down Malaysia.
Imprisoned, the troops were kept without food or water for four days
because they would not sign a document declaring they would not try to
escape. Eventually they signed, using names such as Mickey Mouse and
Greta Garbo.
Construction of the Siam-Burma railway was beginning and the troops
were taken in cattle trucks to Bangkok. The trucks were so crowded
during their four-day journey that they could not lie down.
The ''Death Railway'', intended to take supplies to North Burma, was
260 miles long and went through dense jungle and mountainous country.
Snakes, scorpions, ants, and leeches plagued the POWs who suffered
recurring bouts of dysentery, malaria, typhus, and cholera. There was no
medicine, and it is estimated more than a quarter of the prisoners died.
One who survived was Sergeant McGowran, a young journalist now living
in Linlithgow. He suffered it all, and guessed the war must be near its
end one day when out of the morning mist a nude young girl came to him
and asked him for a light. Sergeant McGowran, who was making rice
porridge over a campfire, obliged and then went on with his cooking. The
girl was a Korean comfort girl and was one of a group being taken down
the line by retreating Japanese.
After his experience in Burma, Sergeant McGowran was happy to return
to journalism and became managing editor, then managing director, of the
Falkirk Herald. For other public services to the community he was later
honoured with the award of the Order of the British Empire.
The Japanese made their way up through Lower Burma until they came to
the Sittang Bridge -- and one of the great disasters of the Burma
campaign. There was fierce fighting to save Rangoon, but the Japs
penetrated the outer defence and so the order was given to blow the
bridge. This was done -- and two-thirds of the 17th Division were left
on the far side of the Sittang.
The Japanese were now able to press on with their objective and in
their victorious onward march now received valuable assistance from a
Burmese patriot. Many Burmese did not like being part of the British
Commonwealth and Aung San was one. With his 7000-strong guerrilla force
he formed the Burma National Army and was great support for the
Japanese.
The Royal Engineers played a great part in delaying the Japanese. One
of them was Second Lieutenant Eric Yarrow. He was lucky. His ship had
been bound for Singapore but was diverted to Rangoon when it became
known what had happened to the ships ahead of them.
Second Lieutenant Yarrow, a few weeks previously acting unpaid Lance
Corporal, later, Major, and, post-war, Sir Eric Yarrow, chairman of
Yarrows of Scotstoun shipbuilders, and now chairman of the Burma Star
Association, had an especially good time at the Irrawaddy. His unit blew
up every ship in sight, many of them built at Yarrows.
A valuable army group was the Chindits. Their function as a long-range
penetration group was to patrol behind enemy lines, harass Japanese, and
send back information to their base. They were from many units,
including the Black Watch and the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). One
base was given the name ''Aberdeen'' and when General Orde Wingate
visited them he told their CO, Lieutenant-Colonel Green, that the men
should be praised for being the first Scottish troops to land at a
Scottish airport in Burma. At the close of his visit General Wingate
bade officers and men farewell and took off in his aircraft for Imphal.
Sadly, his plane crashed and he was killed.
In the Arakan, the Royal Scots Fusiliers were in action. This was
bleak mountainous country, part of the Japanese route to Calcutta. A
daring exploit was carried out here by a Japanese Colonel. The 7th
Indian Division under the command of General Messervy was surrounded and
owed its survival to air supply. Supply by air became very important to
the Royal Scots Fusiliers who had many engagements before joining up
with the 14th Army on its victorious march south.
The Japanese did get to India -- but it was only to the border, Kohima
and Imphal, and their efforts to get further provided four months of the
most bitter fighting of the war. The British troops were encircled and
at one point the British and Japanese were separated only by the width
of the tennis courts of the District Commissioner's house.
Grenades were flung at the British soldiers, who would dash for them
and fling them back. The Cameron Highlanders at one point made a bayonet
charge and were decimated.
Finally the Japanese had to give way. This was the turning point of
the war and they were forced back to where it all began in Burma, the
Sittang Bend.
It was now the time of the monsoon and the plain through which Sittang
flowed was a sea of mud and water through which troops waded up to the
waist.
To cross the Sittang by makeshift rafts, the Japanese had created a
''breakout'' plan. After a battle, a copy of the operational order was
lost and this was found by a patrol from IV Corps. The Japanese did not
realise this and as they operated their plan they suffered a great loss
of men.
Around this time, March 1945, Aung San knew who was going to win the
war and defected to the British.
After the atom bombs, Hiroshima on August 6, and Nagasaki on August 9,
the Japanese Emperor decided his people ''must endure the endurable''
and on August 15, 1945, announced the surrender of his army.
This became known to IV Corps at Waw and it was decided to tell the
Japanese, many of whom had no line of communication with their HQ.
A rail-truck was filled with leaflets telling of Mikado's surrender
and giving instructions on how to make contact with us. The truck was
then pushed down the line and was last seen gathering speed and going
right into the Japanese position.
A few days later a patrol of eight Japanese came out of the jungle
and, meeting a patrol of the 65 Punjabis, told them they wanted to
surrender -- they were promptly taken to the headquarters of the 1/10th
Gurkhas.
Two days later Major Wako Lisanori of the Japanese surrendered his
sword to Lieutenant Colonel O M Smyth, CO of the 1st Battalion of the
Gurkhas, at Abya. Major J Blair, who hailed from Orchard Park,
Edinburgh, and was his second in command, was present.
After several local surrenders, Brigadier Miles Smeaton of IV Corps
had the honour of receiving the surrender on the field of the Japanese
Army at Paung on October 29.
The 1/10 Gurkhas were on parade. The difficulties of life in the field
did not prevent officers and men appearing with peacetime smartness. The
Gurkha hats had been fiercely ironed and tilted to shape and the correct
angle, the green uniforms had been pressed, and lanyards, pistol
holsters, and belts were spotlessly white. For them the wheel of fortune
had turned. Major General Ichida signed the surrender of all Japanese
forces in Burma at Government House, Rangoon, on September 13, the day
after General Itagaki signed the overall surrender in Singapore.
POSTSCRIPT
AUNG SAN -- was assassinated in July 1947.
Burma (now Myanmar) gained independence in 1948. Aung San Suu Kyi,
daughter of Aung San, was freed last month from the house arrest she had
been under since July 1989. At the time of her arrest, she was the
leader of the National League for Democracy, the civilian party in
opposition to the military regime, the State Law and Order restoration
Council (SLORC). In spite of Daw Aung San Kyi's detention, her party won
more than 80% of the vote in the elections held in May 1990, but the
SLORC refused to accept the outcome and instead set up a National
Convention to discuss a new constitution. Most elected MPs were
imprisoned or are in exile.
Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, could
face re-arrest if the SLORC see her as a threat as they draw up a new
constitution which will guarantee the military a dominant role in
Burmese politics.
Japan at the end of the war had lost almost everything. Today it is
the fourth most prosperous country in the world after the USA, Germany,
and Great Britain. It is a leader in building ships and a world leader
in making motor cycles, sewing machines and cameras. It is second in
making automobiles.
Two Blantyre men, Sgt James Prentice and Rifleman John McCartney, of
the 1st Battalion, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) fought their way
back to north Burma then discovered they had now to learn how to handle
mules.
The Cameronians formed two of the Chindits columns which operated
behind the enemy lines and caused havoc. The use of mules for transport
had to be learned as Rifleman McCartney explained: ''It was a carry-on
putting on the, wireless canisters, wirelesses and everything they had
to carry. Some of them you could not even get a saddle on and they
wouldn't go, even with a carrot.''
John went down with malaria and James was injured with shrapnel so
both were sent to base where they eventually became military policemen.
Both declared they had more hassle as policemen than they ever had from
the Japanese.

SCOTLAND -- alone in the UK -- will see no growth in its labour force
or adult population over the next 11 years, according to latest
estimates of labour market trends.
The Scottish labour force is forecast to fall by 0.2% by the year
2006, in sharp contrast to a projected 5.9% increase for the UK as a
whole.
The UK's smallest region, East Anglia, will see a rise of 12.7% in its
labour force, defined as all people aged 16 or over, whether employed,
unemployed, in work-related Government programmes, or unpaid family
workers.
Other fast-growing areas, identified by the Government's Department of
Employment in its official Employment Gazette, include the South-West
(up 10%), East Midlands (9%), Northern Ireland (8%), and the South East
(7%).
SNP leader Alex Salmond said yesterday that the forecasts present ''a
frightening picture of stagnation in Scottish economic activity,
compared to the rest of the country.''
He added: ''The figures provided by the Government's own statisticians
are a sad commentary on the damage to the Scottish economy of London
rule. They project a static population while the rest of the UK powers
ahead.
''They destroy claims of the Scottish Office that Scotland is
prospering within the Union, and pulls the rug from under the feet of
Michael Forsyth.''
The number of men in the Scottish labour force is expected to fall by
4% in the period to 2006, while increases of 4 to 5% are projected in
Humberside, Yorkshire, North West England, the West Midlands, and Wales.
A 2% increase is projected for the north of England.
Overall, the Scottish labour force is expected to fall by 0.2% -- the
decrease kept low because of the rising number of females over the next
decade.
Responding to the statement made by Mr Salmond, Scottish Office
Minister Raymond Robertson last night said it was ''completely
misleading'' to suggest that the survey of labour force trends indicated
that Scottish employment was expected to fall.
Mr Robertson, Minister for Education and Training, said: ''The survey
provides some indication of how many people of working age there will be
over the next 10 years. It does not show how many of these people will
have jobs.
''The survey forecasts the size of the labour force in the UK regions,
which as well as including those in jobs, also includes unpaid family
workers, those in training programmes, and the unemployed.
''Opportunist critics who seek to use the survey for political ends
are deliberately forgetting that in employment, Scotland's record on job
creation has been excellent in recent years, with unemployment in
Scotland at its lowest level since November 1990, and the unemployment
rate in Scotland below the UK rate since February 1992.''
Labour's Trade and Industry spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, stressed the
report projects demographic trends rather than economic prospects, but
added: ''The move away from male employment to part-time, low paid
female jobs is the reality behind Scottish employment statistics.
''I am also very concerned about skill shortages in areas of the
Scottish economy which should have growth potential.''
The Scottish Office yesterday indicated it would issue a response to
the DoE estimates, but later declined comment following talks with
Ministers.
Mr Lex Gold, director of the Scottish CBI, said that any growth in
labour forces outside of Scotland will have to be matched with increases
in jobs, or else unemployment would rise.
He questioned, for example, if East Anglia will be able to provide the
necessary jobs to ensure its soaring labour force would be catered for.
Mr Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Council
(Development and Industry), argued the marginal fall forecast in
Scotland's labour force might even be ''good news'', because fewer
people will be competing for available jobs.
A bullish Scottish Enterprise, charged with job creation and economic
regeneration, dismissed the Department of Employment's latest official
estimates.
A spokesman said forecasters consistently get Scotland's economic
indicators wrong, in relation to the rest of the UK, and added: ''They
are obsessed with pessimism about the Scottish economy. As far as we are
concerned, we have seen and heard it all before.''
Possible reasons for projections of a static adult population in
Scotland include migration by people willing to move elsewhere for work
-- and the so-called ''demographic timebomb'' becoming reality: a low
birthrate coupled with an ageing population.
The report insists that in the past a relatively high increase in
Scottish economic activity rates has outweighed a low population
increase.
However, Mr Salmond stressed it also revealed that the actual
performance of the Scottish economy between 1984-94 was bad in
comparison with elsewhere, even with the benefit of North Sea oil.
The labour force had grown by just 3.6%, compared with the UK average
of 4.6%.
Arguing that the stagnation of Scotland's population was an indictment
of London rule, he said: ''Scotland needs to secure the benefits of
independence so that economic policy can be tailor made for Scottish
conditions and Scottish requirements.
''Unless we have substantial and rapid change in the constitution, and
economic recovery, we will be treading water well into the next
millenium.''
Mr Gold, following Scottish Enterprise's line, said that DoE
forecasters had got it wrong in the past. One report even predicted a
Scottish jobs loss of 20,000 between 1991 and 1994. In fact, 20,000 jobs
were created.
He pointed to a Warwick University study, just published, that
predicts growth in Scotland to the year 2001 of 4.8%, and worth 110,000
more jobs.
Mr Gold's only concern was that such growth will be the second lowest
in the UK, just a fraction above the North West region. The average UK
growth rate was put at 6% by the university researchers.
He said: ''If Scotland's economy can develop a dynamism, and I do not
see why it cannot, then Employment Gazette projections will be made to
look wrong again. They provide even greater cause to get on with the
job.''
Mr Joe McLaughlin, deputy chief executive of Glasgow Chambers of
Commerce, said the forecasts suggested that oil and electronics were not
making up for the decline in Scotland's manufacturing base.
However, Mr Morrison predicted the labour force's drift towards
part-time, casual, or contract labour will continue, and he stressed the
need to increase skills to meet needs of a modern, industrial economy.
Figures suggest that by 2006, Scotland's labour force will stand at
2,514,000 compared, with 2,519,000 last year. The number of men is
forecast at 1,374,000 (1,394,000), and the number of women put at
1,167,000 (1,125,000).
The UK labour force is expected to reach 30,100,000 compared with
28,700,000 this year.

<HEADLINE>Premier's remorse 'not enough'. Japan's hollow apology</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976928970</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Prime Minister yesterday issued the first written apology for
his country's behaviour in the Second World War just days before the
50th anniversary of VJ Day.
In a letter to Mr John Major, premier Tomiichi Murayama expressed his
''profound remorse'' for Japanese actions which caused ''unbearable
suffering''.
But veterans' associations, pressing for a full apology, said
yesterday's statement did not go far enough.
They said it appeared to be a personal apology rather than one on
behalf of the Japanese Government and people.
Yesterday's letter also made no mention of compensation, and victims
pursuing claims in the Japanese courts said their campaign would go on.
Previous apologies were given verbally to Mr Major, and Mr Murayama
wrote that he reiterated them. He expressed ''my profound remorse for
Japan's actions in a certain period of the past which caused such
unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people''.
Downing Street said the text of the letter would not be released
because it was in Japanese and confidential correspondence to the Prime
Minister.
When Mr Major visited Japan in September, 1993, he received a verbal
apology from the then Prime Minister Morihiro Hofokawa.
Mr Hofokawa expressed deep remorse and apologies for the fact that
Japanese actions inflicted such deep wounds on many people including
former prisoners of war.
In his letter, Mr Murayama made mention of this apology and wrote: ''I
reiterate this sentiment.''
Yesterday's written statement may be seen as a bold step by a Japanese
leader in charge of a coalition government which is split over whether
to apologise for the country's wartime record.
It came after the 50th anniversary commemorations for the hundreds of
thousands of Japanese civilians killed when the Allies bombed Hiroshima
and Nagasaki.
Next weekend Britain commemorates the 50th anniversary of the end of
the war in the Far East.
A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Major was pleased with the written
apology.
The Royal British Legion said the Japanese letter was ''a significant
step forward'' and predicted it should pave the way to reconciliation.
The legion handed in a letter to Mr Murayama at the Japanese Embassy
on Thursday calling for an official apology and the payment of
compensation to all those who suffered at Japanese hands during the war.
Mr Martyn Day, the lawyer representing British PoWs and internees from
Japan, said: ''The problems with the apology are that it is from Mr
Murayama himself and not his government and this is a country that
changes prime ministers extremely regularly.
''Secondly, the apology has been sent to Mr Major and is in very
general terms. The PoWs and internees want an apology sent to them which
is directed at them.
''Thirdly, the apology makes no mention of compensation and without
the Japanese paying damages to the PoWs and internees, Mr Murayama's
words remain hollow. The court fight, therefore, continues.''
Mr Keith Martin, chairman of the ABCI, Far Eastern Region, said: ''It
is a small step. The man is trying. ''But it sounds very much like he is
going over old ground. It is a personal apology and not one on behalf of
the Japanese Government and people.''
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook welcomed the apology. ''It is
important for Japan as well as Britain that the Japanese should admit
and condemn their forces' war time atrocities,'' he said.
''Japan must now follow this up by accepting the claim for
compensation by the former prisoners of war.''
Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell, MP for Fife North
East, said: ''This apology is not sufficiently fulsome to satisfy all of
the ex-servicemen's and victims' associations.
''But it does represent a fairly substantial movement from the
Japanese Government's previous position.''
Major John Aitkin, chairman of the Royal British Legion Scotland, said
last night at his home in Hawick: ''I am glad to hear that an apology
has been made at last.
''We in the legion feel very strongly about the Far Eastern prisoners
of war. They got a very bad deal. The legion has always fought to
protect their interests and still does.''

Murder, mystery and a cut-down Hamlet are among the books Kenny
Ireland, Director of the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, reads for pleasure,
find Ann Donald.
* I DON'T know if this counts but I've been reading a script sent to
me by David Mamet in the last few days. When he was over in Edinburgh
earlier this year and we were doing Oleanna, I was talking to him about
how difficult it is to cut Hamlet and he said that he'd already done it
for his Backbay Theatre Company in Chicago. So that's what I'm reading
-- Mamet's cut version of Hamlet which has come privately from him, so
we're very pleased about it.
I've also just finished Annie Proulx's The Shipping News which I found
to be a very emotional book and which was recommended by my wife.
Another book that I read on holiday was Peter Hoeg's Miss Smilla's
Feeling for Snow. I loved the thriller aspect of that and the wonderful
descriptions of snow and ice. It's actually about a child who falls from
a great height and Miss Smilla reckons that he'd been forced to fall.
This in turn is all tied up with mysterious happenings from the Second
World War in the Antarctic and Miss Smilla travels round places like
Norway following up her leads. It's a bit like Miss Marples goes to
Greenland except she has this gift that she can read and feel the snow.
Another great book that I'm in the middle of is Mallory's Oracle by
Carol O'Connell. It's about the investigation into the murder case of a
New York policeman by his stepdaughter, whom he rescued from the streets
and has also become a cop. So far we know that he's been murdered by a
serial killer and that's all I've read.
In our family we call these kind of books ''rotters''. I'm the only
one who reads them because I find crime, thrillers, and airport books
very relaxing after you've spent most of your time doing research
reading for all the books connected to the play we might be performing.
My wife disapproves of my taste a lot of the time so she finds
interesting books for me to read and because she reads so much herself I
pick up her leftovers.

Today's launch of the seventh Edinburgh Book Festival coincides with
National Book Day, a combination which will inspire new interest and
rekindle existing love of all things literary. Magnus Linklater opens
our special Book Festival edition with great expectations of the
chemistry created when writers and readers finally meet and gives an
overview of proceedings which will include everything from an audience
with the creator of the popular children's stories featuring Maisie the
cat, through practical demonstrations of cookery, batik and calligraphy
to discussion on the nature and relevance of literature in society
TWO years ago this month I sat in the lofty back row of the Post
Office Main Theatre at the Edinburgh Book Festival and enjoyed an
animated chat with my next-door neighbour, a lady from Bruntsfield. She
told me that in her experience Dorothy Dunnett had a very nice manner
and was generous with the messages she inscribed in her books, that Ben
Okri was one of the new writers to watch, and as for that Garrison
Keillor, she could sit listening to him all night. ''You know,'' she
said, ''these two weeks are the most important in my life. I book my
holidays in advance so that I never miss them, and my husband's not
speaking to me because I spend all the housekeeping on books.''
I guessed I was sitting next to a genuine literary groupie. And
watching the way she set out to corral Jung Chang afterwards, I could
tell she was a professional. But it was her bubbling enthusiasm for
books and writers that most impressed me. If she was in any way typical
of the thousands of ordinary folk who swarm through the tents in
Charlotte Square every two years, then the Book Festival has achieved
something important -- it has infected the citizenry with the virus of
bibliolatry, which my dictionary tells me means ''a reverence for
books''.
It may be going a little far to compare it to the outbreak of
licentiousness which my father, Eric Linklater, described in his novel
The Merry Muse, where a clandestinely published volume of Robert Burns's
bawdy poems leads to Dionysian frenzy on the streets of Edinburgh. But
it would be nice to see a parallel in the description, by one of his
characters, of a bookshop near Chambers Street ''crowded with people
clamouring for poetry books -- not of the modern sort, but the
old-fashioned kind that did not fear to speak of love, beauty, and
kindliness beneath a hedgerow with roses. What a trade that shop was
doing! No other took a penny . . . ''
That is certainly the way booksellers would like to see the Festival,
and there is no doubt that the spin-off in terms of sales at the
bookshops along George Street and Princes Street, to say nothing of the
smaller second-hand ones lurking down Old Town wynds or the purlieus of
Stockbridge, accounts for the commercial support it receives as well as
its popularity with publishers.
But if this, the seventh Book Festival, is to repeat the resounding
success of its predecessors, it must do so by reproducing the chemistry
that is created when writers meet their readers and discover that the
experience can actually be enjoyable. There is something about the
atmosphere of a fete-champetre under the canvas that helps in the
essential informality of the occasion, and it is a great soother of
nerves.
I remember talking to the novelist Deborah Moggach before she was due
to meet her audience in one of the smaller tents. It was not exactly
full to capacity, and she said she felt deeply unconfident about how she
was going to create a rapport with a group of people who were probably
unfamiliar with her novels and knew little about her. For the first few
minutes there was, it is true, a coolness about the reception, but as
she began talking, in that breathless way of hers, about the process of
writing and what it could achieve, a bond began to be formed. Her
listeners leant forward intently, and she responded by taking as great
an interest in them as they were taking in her. By the time the session
had reached its conclusion, a dialogue of such delightful intensity had
been created that neither author nor audience wanted it to end.
The best moments are often the unscheduled ones, but the imagination
used by the Festival's directors down the years in bringing together
writers from different countries or different disciplines, who may never
have met each other, but who share ideas and themes, creates a
serendipity which makes for genuine excitement.
The Neil Gunn Centenary mini-conference in 1991, which brought writers
from all over the world to discuss ideas about language, tradition, and
creativity, was an example of how intellectual discussion can make for
riveting theatre -- most of the talks were sold out.
For me the high point of 1993 was the meeting between Jung Chang and
Christabel Bielenberg, both victims of terrying regimes -- in China and
Nazi Germany -- but both from different generations. Their humanity,
frankness, and warmth towards each other and the matter-of-fact way in
which they exchanged ideas about suffering and survival made it an
occasion of great emotional power.
This year the pairing of Mary Wesley, a seasoned and phenomenally
successful writer, with Joan Brady, a relative newcomer but already the
winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year Award, will certainly be worth
listening to. They have not met before. The discussion between Philip
Kerr, author of A Philosophical Investigation and The Gridiron, the
novelist Piers Paul Read, and the critic John Carey is also likely to
provide a challenging exchange of ideas, as will the dialogue between
James Berry, a poet with his roots in the West Indies, and Brendan
Kennelly, one of Ireland's most distinguished poets.
This year the Children's Tent, with Bank of Scotland sponsorship, has
expanded, with a range of activities laid on, as well as a creche and a
''help desk'' to guide bewildered parents through the huge array of
children's books available. As always, the Spiegeltent, with its cafe
atmosphere, will be the place to go to hear writers, performers, and
late-night jazz. Among the Festival highlights are lectures from Rose
Tremain, David Daiches, Janice Galloway, Ludovic Kennedy, David
Sylvester, Marina Warner, and Roy Jenkins.
But if there is a theme emerging at all from this year's Festival, it
is the energy and originality emanating from a new generation of
Scottish writers. They will all be there: Iain Banks, Janice Galloway,
Jackie Kay, A L Kennedy, Duncan McLean, and Irvine Welsh among them. So
once again the Festival demonstrates its broad international appeal, but
with its cultural roots firmly implanted.
Director Shona Munro can draw much satisfaction from the ''A List'' of
writers who have agreed to come to Edinburgh. That they do so is a
tribute to her dogged negotiations with publishers and booksellers, as
well as the all-round appeal of what has been described as ''Britain's
biggest and most contagiously enjoyable book festival''. We hope that
everyone, readers and non-readers alike, will catch the contagion as
enthusiastically as the lady from Bruntsfield.
* Magnus Linklater is Chairman of the Edinburgh Book Festival. The
Festival runs from August 12-28 in Charlotte Square. Tickets are
available by post from Box O, Edinburgh Book Festival, Scottish Book
Centre, 137 Dundee Street, Edinburgh EH11 IBG, or by telephone with
Access and Visa on 0131 220 3990. Further information during the

Hugh MacDiarmid v Edwin Muir
* A 12-year friendship stretched and snapped when critic Edwin Muir
wrote that the Scots language was intellectually exhausted, incapable of
revival, and only English could further the literary aspirations of
modern Scotland. Hugh MacDiarmid went ballistic. Not only had the native
tongue been insulted but his work as well. The missive from Muir was an
extract from his book Scott and Scotland published in Outlook magazine.
MacDiarmid's letter in retort was deemed so vicious by the magazine's
publisher that he dared not print it.
Instead MacDiarmid printed a press release cursing the magazine for
falling in with ''a worthless set of people -- a historically doomed
class of petit-bourgeois due for speedy liquidation''. MacDiarmid
treated Muir with constant hostility from then on, yet Muir never
responded. It did, however, deeply affect him, haunting his dreams. In
The Combat, a poem published in 1947, two unmatched antagonists fight a
perpetual battle, with a crested animal tearing the heart from a milder
beast.
As Alan Bold wrote in his biography, MacDiarmid: ''Poetic logic would
allow Muir to see MacDiarmid as a pitiless enemy and himself as a
perpetual victim.''

A CRUCIAL part of moving is telling people that you have changed
homes. Failure to do so could have, in some cases, drastic consequences.
Top of the list, of course, is family and friends. Then you'll have to
contact the gas and electricity suppliers as far ahead as possible for
final readings of meters, and to arrange new supplies. Similarly with
the telephone: BT need two weeks' warning for a new line to be ready,
but to include your new number on change of address cards, it's best to
organise this earlier. Don't forget to notify Mercury, pager and mobile
companies if you use their services.
TV licences require a change of address to be notified, and permission
must be received from television and appliance rental companies to
remove their equipment to the new address, which they will also need for
their accounts department.
Complete the relevant sections of both your vehicle registration form,
and your driving licence, and send them to DVLC in Swansea; arrange with
the Royal Mail (which needs seven days' notice) to forward mail to your
new address -- from #6 for a month, to #30 for a year. The milkman and
newsagent will have to be paid up to date, and have orders either
cancelled or redirected if you remain in their area.
What else? House contents insurance; life insurance and pensions;
vehicle insurance; National Insurance/DHS; professional advisers such as
solicitor, accountant, stockbroker.
Also, Save-As-You-Earn/National Savings Certificates need to be
informed (Post Offices can supply an envelope). Not forgetting: Pension
book (contact the Post Office); Child Allowance (notify the DHS). The
Tax Office; Premium Bonds (get envelope from the Post Office); doctor;
dentist; optician and vet; Local authority.
All these people have to know where you are going, and when.

WHEN Robert Louis Whatsisname wrote ''To travel hopefully is a better
thing than to arrive'', he was unconsciously devising a brilliant
anti-slogan for the removals business. He was not writing without
experience either.
We know that RLS moved house several times. He started out from his
parents' stylish residence in Edinburgh and set up home at various times
in the United States, the south of England, and Samoa. In those
nineteenth-century days, maybe, the removals business wasn't quite as
slickly organised as it is now. There were no ''Yellow Pages'' for,
given the quality of the paper, all pages were yellow in the nineteenth
century. You couldn't phone up and ask for a quote, because there were
no phones for most of the time.
Perhaps this was just as well. If RLS had made the move in the late
twentieth century, we could imagine him phoning up his local removal
firm (three men and a dog with serious beer-bellies, the dog included)
and asking for a quote for the move to Samoa. The conversation would go
like this:
''Listen, are you the felly who wrote that to travel hopefully is a
better thing than to arrive?''
''Yes. I am gratified by the reference.''
''Well, Jimmy, ye should cocoa. Ye ain't seen naethin' yet. We'll gie
ye a quote for the Samoa job, but ye'll hae to travel mair hopefully
than ye've ever imagined. An' as tae arriving', that's just when the
difficulties start, funnily enough. But that's your problem. Cheers
though, Jimmy.''
All of us who have moved house -- and many of us have moved more than
once -- know the meaning of trauma. RLS should have written that ''to
pack craftily and to travel hopefully is a dawdle; it's when you arrive
that the whole thing falls apart''. For that's when the best-laid plans
o' mice and home-buyers go desperately agley (and this is adapted from
another poet, Rabbie Whatsisname).
I've always been struck by the close relationship that builds up
between removal men and the people they are removing. The association
normally lasts for little more than a day. In this short time, the
removers assume responsibility for almost everything you own --
everything that's valuable or merely important -- and this blend of
trust and terror is a powerful force that binds you together until, as
the pubs open, the big van drives away. You will never again meet these
men and this dog to whom (disasters excluded) you gave an over-generous
tip, influenced more by relief than anything else. The next time you
move, if ever, you will find new men and a new dog handling your
destiny.
It's only later, when you realise that the boxes marked ''Kitchen''
are in the garden shed, and the boxes marked ''Bedroom 2'' are in the
kitchen, that you wonder whether your tip was a bit over the top. But
this is also when you start to appreciate Robert Louis Whatsisname. He
didn't arrive hopefully either.

Packing up for a new home can be so traumatic that some people just
freeze on the spot, says Wendy Jack, gleaning some helpful observations
from the experts.
NOT many of us relish the thought of moving house. Indeed, according
to Pickfords -- which deals with a whopping annual removals turnover of
#100m -- the removers will turn up occasionally to find the whole family
still in bed and sound asleep. Such people clearly regard the whole idea
as one big snore.
Other unusual scenarios have included cases of wives who have been
persuaded by their husbands to move house against their will. When the
big day dawns, she refuses to budge. Then there are the humiliating
scenes in the warehouse, when a divorcing couple argue over who'll get
which parts of the three-piece suite . . . or the wardrobe . . . or the
cat.
Oh, yes. All human life is spread before the removal men, from the
delightful through the moaners to the downright impossible. No surprise,
then, to discover that, as a breed, they quickly develop a pragmatic
psychology to help them deal with their fellow human beings on the move.
Some of us fondly imagine that today's widespread dishonesty is a
symptom of declining standards in modern life, but Pickfords -- with
roots going back to around 1650 -- can explode that myth.
Between the wars, one dear old lady sent some valuable china by rail,
and in a spirit of false economy, paid the lowest rate, which meant it
was carried at owner's risk. The china duly arrived -- smashed to
pieces.
But the old girl was hit by a spiffing wheeze. She carefully repacked
the pieces, handed it to Pickfords, addressed to another destination,
and paid their insurance against breakage.
Only by chance, the company heard that she had claimed against a
railway company for the same china. Alas for her, when her claim against
Pickfords duly arrived, it was politely turned down. Under-insurance
remains one of the most consistent problems that people on the move give
themselves.
Apart from the essential list of people to advise of your new address
(see overpage) there are other vital things to remember in moving the
more vulnerable members of the family as untraumatically as possible.
Tips from a Pickfords manager:
* Children: Under-fives should be told two to four weeks before
removal day and reassurance is vital at this stage since the very young
can have all kinds of irrational worries.
''Children can't understand the necessity of moving, seeing it as
confusion and upheaval,'' explains child psychologist Linda Walker.
Insecurity is probably inevitable. ''They'll ask 'Is mummy coming with
us?' and 'Are we taking my bed?'.''
Older children should be told before they semi-twig what's happening
from snatches of overheard conversation. They should be involved in the
preparations by letting them pack their own toys, for example, to keep
them busy and, says Ms Walker, ''to remind them of the positive things
they have to look forward to -- 'sell' the move to the child.''
Life, as she points out, is all about change and adapting to it, and
parents should view this time as one of helping children cope with
uncertainty.
* Pensioners: This can be very emotional for all the family. Perhaps a
partner has died, or the person may be leaving a much-loved house and
neighbourhood. The advice here is to make a big effort to reach out, and
make sure you don't let yourself become isolated. If you are moving to
sheltered accommodation, the warden will give advice on services and
groups available, and Age Concern, the Citizens' Advice Bureau or the
local library can give information on what's on offer locally, to
retired people.
Try to quickly establish a new routine, to get oriented and to get to
know people. Think about taking up a new hobby or joining a society
which interests you, and find out if the mobile library visits if you
don't find it easy to get out.
It's all-important to keep reminding yourself that, more often than
not, a change is for the better!

Try out these ideas to save yourself room and maybe you won't even
have to move, says Jean Graham.
DO you remember when you could pack everything you owned into a single
travelling trunk to move house at the drop of a hat? For most of us,
those days don't last long. We settle down and begin to accumulate
possessions at an alarming rate -- and only realise just how much we
have when the time comes to move.
Or perhaps our intensifying lack of space prompts the desire to move.
Either way, clever storage must help. Sooner or later, cupboards,
wardrobes -- even attic space -- start to overflow; but there are
several new design ideas on the market these days that can ease the
problem -- and perhaps even delay that expensive move.
One solution is to rationalise what is already available. You should
be able to solve the problem without recourse to joiners, builders or
estate agents if you work around the home, indentifying and tackling the
areas most under pressure.
In the kitchen, mobile storage space could prove invaluable. The solid
ash Space Saver Island from Scotts of Stow (telephone 01249 449111 for a
mail-order catalogue) is a compact version of the popular butcher's
trolley, designed with the small kitchen in mind. Costing #149.95, it
can be wheeled out to provide an extra preparation surface -- and tucked
back into a corner later.
Its shelves provide valuable storage space for cookery books, kitchen
utensils and those store cupboard essentials, while its lockable castors
mean it can be revolved on its axis for easy access to all sides.
Even more compact is Scotts' Cherrywood Chopping Board and Drawer at
#29.95, a butcher's block and storage space in one. Also from Scotts of
Stow, a wall-fitting, solid pine foldaway table for #39.95 and an
exceptionally handsome maple foldaway table at #149.95 provide extra
working or dining surfaces when needed without hogging all the available
space in your kitchen.
On a smaller scale, there are plenty of ingenious ways to maximise
your kitchen shelf and cupboard space at minimal cost. Both Scotts of
Stow and Lakeland Plastics (telephone 015394 88100) specialise in clever
storage solutions for the kitchen. Lakeland's Space Saver Shelf (#6.95
or #12.34 for two) fits inside a cupboard or on top of a worktop to
provide extra shelving instantly, while its four-tier Plate Stacker
(fror about #8) protects your dinner service from knocks and chipping.
Scotts also produce sturdy Crockery Organisers designed along similar
lines for people ''with more crockery than cupboard space''.
In the porch or utility room, Lakeland Plastics' 12-tier Shoe Store
neatly stacks all your boots and outdoor shoes together in pairs and
take up 11 inches x 51 inches of floor space.
If you can't face stacking things away out of sight, Habitat's wicker
baskets are attractive enough to look good on desktop and open shelving
in the living room or study. They come in a range of sizes -- from small
pencil trays to large lidded boxes -- and two colours, navy and natural.
Prices range from #5.50 to #19.00.
Habitat also sells a selection of pale natural canvas boxes and trays.
A filing tray in this range costs #12.50 and a medium-sized box #17.50.
Also useful is Habitat's range of heavy card boxes designed to store
compact discs, videos, audio cassettes and files. Costing from #5.50 to
#12.50, these are a smart and economic way to bring some order to your
home.
In the bedroom, a solid, stainless steel expandable clothes rail
(#29.95 from Scotts of Stow) provides flexible storage for guests. Extra
bedding or out-of-season clothes can be kept clean, organised and
instantly identifiable in Lakeland Plastics' clear-sided stackable
Store-n-View Boxes. Or try Habitat's capacious wicker hampers in three
generous sizes at #48, #60 and #120. The largest size is secured with
sturdy leather straps and buckles.
If you face a daily scrabble through an overstuffed and untidy
wardrobe for a pair of shoes and an outfit, it's time to revamp your
storage. Lakeland Plastics' Wardrobe Space Saver (#2) holds four hangers
apart on a lightweight plastic bar, one end of which can be released to
provide extra space without crushing your clothes. If you have room for
an extra hanging rod, its Add-a-Bar #12.75 is a self-supporting, locking
tension rod which can be very quickly and easily installed.
If, on the other hand, you have plenty of hanging space but not enough
room in your clothes cupboards, Add-a-Shelf (#23.95) is a lightweight
storage system with adjustable shelves which hangs inside your wardrobe.
Finally, keep your shoes neat, clean and organised with the Shoe Tidy
(#4.95).
* Lakeland Plastics Shoe Tidy #4.95, Wardrobe Space Savers #2 each.
* Scotts of Stow Space Saver Island #149.95; Maple Foldaway Table
#149.95; Crockery Organiser #9.95.
* Habitat wicker baskets, from #5.50 to #19.00, canvas baskets from
#12.50-#22.00.

* THE relationship between trees and buildings has always been
sensitive. The same is true for gardens, or neighbouring land.
No-one would deny that trees have a vital role to play, and there have
been many schemes to exploit this philosophy over the years.
Members of Glasgow Tree Lovers, encouraged by the late Mrs Mackenzie
Anderson, were involved in many areas of Glasgow.
In recent years, the activities of the Central Scotland Countryside
Trust has done much to encourage planting and planting schemes, from
roadsides to factory precincts, transforming dereliction into beauty.
While schemes are carefully planned today, this was not always so.
Around the West End of Glasgow and Pollokshields, there are instances of
planting, before many of us were born, which are a source of potential
damage to buildings, excluding light, and causing damage to drains or
foundations.
In spite of problems, many people have a strong attachment to trees.
The recent outcry in Pollok is a typical example, especially as one
would presume the trees involved are perfectly healthy and not a hazard.
One would assume that all trees that could be left were preserved and
that new plantings will take place as soon as possible.
There are some famous trees in Glasgow, notably the ash tree in Argyle
Street. It's the one not too far from the Kelvin Hall -- an example of
inadvertent conservation, one might say.
In new housing developments there can also be a tricky situation of
what can be left and what has to go in terms of safety. The
over-enthusiasm of some developers has caused problems in this
direction.
Tree preservation orders were rightly introduced, but where safety is
a factor, most officers will take this very much into account. So will
any qualified consultant.
It is important to choose someone covered by professional indemnity.
Contractors should be insured for public liability. You should never let
loose a cowboy operator.
Apart from the danger to buildings, trees can be a serious bone of
contention between neighbours. Roots can make borders useless. Large
trees shut out the light.
Apart from sheer inconvenience, tree surgery or removal can be costly.
It is something to be avoided if at all possible. As an adviser I was
frequently called on to report on problems like these.
The irony is that you do not always plant trees. They can come in
uninvited as seeds. Ignore the seedlings for too many years, and it is
too late. You can get a lawyer's letter, or run up a hefty bill to
restore peace.
Most garden centres tend to stock trees suitable for gardens, and can
give appropriate advice. You should still be careful where you plant
them. You won't be popular if you blank out sunlight in a few years,
from expensively constructed patios.
A common mistake is to plant quick-growing Leyland cypress as a hedge,
without realising the potential shade and root problem you can create
for your neighbours.

* I HAVE a patch of the old favourite, Solomon's Seal. I note that
many leaves have been stripped. Will this kill off the plant and what
should I do about things?
* It is very likely you have an attack of one of the many caterpillars
around this year. It is such a vigorous plant it is unlikely that
caterpillars will kill it.
If you are really concerned, start spraying with a good general
insecticide, such as malathion or Tumble Bug. If you don't like using
these, I suggest you let nature take its course or use one of the more
environmentally friendly ones such as fatty acid derivatives.
* My lawn is developing thin, brown patches as the grass appears to
die away. an you advise on the bet way to treat this problem?
* This is probably a combination of thatch and the very hot weather,
with possibly a side issue involving roots of trees. I have the odd
patches in my own lawn. You get a layer of vegetative tissue building up
on the surface on the grass where root and top growth is restricted.
The real answer is to scarify out dead grass, which leaves the lawn
pretty thin in the short term. Spiking with a garden fork or lawn
aerator to break up the compact layer below the thatch is helpful. Work
in some coarse sand to the holes left by forking. This helps to
encourage more active root growth.
If you are concerned about the grass being really thin, you can always
pop some lawn seeds into holes made with a garden fork. Do this when
some moisture comes along, ideally in the autumn when temperatures will
be a good deal lower than recently.
I HAVE been hearing about blotchy ripening of tomatoes. Many gardeners
are wondering why this is happening. They have not done anything
different to actions taken in the past.
This situation is one associated with irregular provision of water and
nutrients. Plants can be particularly prone to this sort of upset.
It has been a season of considerable variation so far, between
excessive heat and cold. Plants simply cannot cope, if they are not
adequately supplied with food and moisture all the time.
The only plants I have in grow-bags and bolsters are on the grow-pot
system, with two plastic rings. The outer is a reservoir for moisture.
So far, the system has given no trouble.
Most of my tomatoes are grown in greenhouse borders. Holes were filled
with Levington compost. It gave a good start. Results have been
excellent so far.

WALLS may not a prison make, but they can be unsightly. Instead of
leaving them as eyesores, why not turn them into vertical garden plots
where you can grow a wide range of colourful flowering shrubs or
variegated evergreens? You can even turn them into a mini-orchard.
There are two groups of climbers. There's the self-clinging type that
has adhesive pads at the end of aerial roots such as ivy and Virginia
creeper, and the group that twine, climb with tendrils, or grapple, such
as Wisteria and passionflower.
A number of gardeners, particularly new home-owners and those with
town gardens, are looking for a quick cover-up but the most vigorous
climbers are not always the most successful.
Russian vine, also known as mile-a-minute, can grow up to 20 feet in a
year and blooms from midsummer well into autumn with clusters of white
flowers tinged with pink. In winter it dies right back and it is
difficult to eliminate once established.
If you want to cover a large wall such as the the front or side of
your house, you would be better off with Virginia creeper, an attractive
climber with magnificent leaves which turn crimson in autumn. This hardy
species will grow to around 70 feet.
Some climbers can enhance the value of your home and in this category
the sun-loving Wisterias, known as the Queen of Climbers with its mauvey
flowers and potent fragrance, holds a special appeal, along with
climbing roses.
Different kinds of climbers can combine to give year-round colour.
Many climbers flower at the topmost shoots, allowing the planting of
contrasting colour at their base.
And no cottage would be complete without roses round the door. Some
climbing varieties are well suited to both north and east walls.
SIX OF THE BEST
* Ivies make interesting wall cover. Manda's Crested is a wavy-edged
ivy which goes a beautiful shade of red in winter.
* Clematis -- more than 200 species, some good north-wallers.
* Japanese honeysuckle, with semi-evergreen leaves and sweetly scented
flowers will cop with shade.
* Virginia creeper. Lovely spring and summer foliage and superb autumn
colour.
* Crimson glory vine. Dramatic leaves for quick summer colour.
* Climbing Hydrangea. White flowers open in June. Likes the shade.

MYRA PATER visits a haven of tranquillity in the city.
I WAS once stuck in a traffic jam on a Boston flyover in a temperature
of 98F. The only things that made the hold-up bearable were my
companions, the air conditioning, and the elevated view of rooftop and
balcony gardens, many as opulent as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
To view one such surprising treasure in Glasgow -- a secluded garden
enclosed behind the Baroque-style facade of Charing Cross Mansions --
you would have to take a helicopter flight.
Edmund Smith moved there about 20 years ago and 10 years passed before
he began to transform the area which was the single-storey roof of a
former Woolworth's. Today it is a haven of tranquillity with a wide
variety of trees, shrubs and plants.
Edmund and his wife Anna, helped by their neighbours, haven't made
just a garden, but laid down the foundations for a strong community
environment for the seven or so families who live in the Mansions.
The garden is a cornucopia of eucalyptus, clematis, climbing rose, bay
trees, honeysuckle, hydrangea, berberis, buddleia, a magnificent
Japanese maple, and many other plants, all grouped together or linked by
the trellis feature which holds the Christmas lights.
By choice, there's not an annual in sight, but the variety of the
foliage and the flowers provides a muted colour scheme that reflects the
peacefulness. Even in deepest winter, the variegated hollies, complete
with berries, and the beautifully marked ivy which grows along the east
wall, provide a flash of brightness.
Edmund doesn't find too many problems associated with gardening in
this way, as long as a good type of compost is used and regular watering
is observed. If a plant begins to look poorly, he often moves it to
another position, perhaps with more light, or less, or against a wall.
Trial and error seems to be the watchword here, as testified by the
conifers and ferns which grow happily in a slightly sloping right-angle
corner which retains moisture.
I was almost taken in by the cluster of mock grapes beside a real vine
which has produced only a few small fruits. I suggested to Edmund that
he could consider moving it to grow beside the blackcurrant bush
fruiting vigorously in the shade below his window.
Unlike all of the other plants, this is not in a container, but merely
in a large ball of soil sited behind a seat. Not a procedure that would
be recommended readily to most gardeners, but he wonders if there is a
link between its success and the fact that the seat is a reclaimed
church pew.
There is a soporific quality to the garden, not all due to the
heatwave on the day I visited. At this time of the year it gets the sun
from around 10am till early evening.
I saw it with Carla, one of the residents, and her children Emma and
Ross, lapped by the sound of the traffic which is incredibly like
breakers on a distant shore. When she first saw the schedule for the
flat she now lives in and noted the description ''City Garden'', Carla
treated it with the scepticism often reserved for this term, but was
taken aback by the view from the rear windows.
It's a place that encourages relaxed conversation, and we talked about
the existing plants, herbs and -- when I spotted bowls of garlic growing
above Edmund and Anna's door -- superstitions. There's a rowan for
protection in another corner; there's also a laburnum tree which
produced the first gardening lesson for Emma and Ross.
This is an area where children can play safely -- but they are made
aware of the care they have to take when running about or playing with a
ball. They have a wonderful playhouse in the old tile-clad wash-house.
The children also make their own contribution by looking after the
chestnut trees which have been grown from sweet chestnuts and labelled
with their respective names. Much more personal than Celastrus scandens.
They even have their very own ''Fairy Ring'', a circular area surrounded
by palings which was once a large rooflight for Woolworths.
Simon, the resident cat, seems to be a deterrent against other
felines, with the exception of a lame ginger tom with a penchant for
curries. Pigeons prefer the rich pickings of the streets outside, and
there is a remarkable absence of the normal garden pests that plague
most gardeners at this time of the year.
As we talked, a red damsel fly landed on the table. A dragonfly made
an occasional appearance too. And, on my departure, I saw a red admiral
settling on the deep purple buddleia by the stairs.
As I stepped out on to the street to be blasted by both the heat and
the noise from the traffic on the M8, it was difficult to think that, no
more than 20 yards from where I stood, there is a spot which truly
deserves the title The Secret Garden.

* FROM many years of learning my trade, one thing that came through
loud and clear was the need to be good to the land. Rotary cultivators
were frowned on. It was all deep digging, a process that went on from
autumn to winter.
There was no time or credence given to the shallow digging now so
popular. Opportunity was taken to dig in vast quantities of well
rotted-organic manure for flower and vegetable production.
Root crops were grown in strict crop rotation, in areas manured the
previous year. I regret to say that I mainly carry out rotary
cultivation today.
However, with access to composted industrial waste materials, from
seaweed and paper industries, I have incorporated considerable amounts
into flower beds as an experiment.
There was a rather slow start by many flowers. During the last few
weeks, however, growth has been very impressive. I have never had
antirrhinums, lobelias, and alyssum like them.
I also used considerable quantities in the vegetable garden. Results
have been remarkably good. I also tried the material neat and with soil,
in pots and in containers. In all cases, results have been excellent.
Root growth has been exceptionally good and far in excess of that from
some brands of peat-based fertilisers.
Unlike many organic fertilisers based mainly on composted chicken
manure, the range I have been working with can be used in considerable
quantity to condition soil with no adverse effects.
Many gardeners still swear by farmyard manure but this is getting
increasingly difficult to get in well-rotted form. It can often
introduce a tremendous amount of weed growth in any case, as I have
discovered to my sorrow in the past.
This is not so with composted organics. All weed seeds, pests and
diseases are killed off. Further trials are proceeding with these
materials. They should be on the market in the next year or so.

Maureen Whitemore is bringing homestyle expertise to our doorstep,
says Wendy Jack.
IF you've ever looked longingly at the work of professional soft
furnishing makers, and thought ''If only I could do that . . . '' you
should be interested in the Innovations Interiors Roadshow which starts
in Stirling tomorrow, aiming to impart expert know-how on putting
together beautiful home interiors.
The bright idea of Maureen Whitemore, the show brings together the
general public and manufacturers of fabrics, wall-coverings and
curtain-making accessories, against a backdrop of seminars and workshops
which guide novices, step by step, on how to achieve
professional-looking curtain treatments, stencilling, colour schemes,
and sewing techniques.
Involved in soft furnishing for 27 years, Maureen Whitemore -- who,
along with her husband, owns a hotel in Cumbria -- decided some years
ago that she would create a scheme to encompass all her expertise.
She explains: ''So many people said they'd love to look over my
shoulder when I was making beautiful things for the hotel, that
eventually my husband said: 'Do you fancy running a course?' I loved the
idea. I've always trained girls and set up workrooms for other people. I
felt I'd like to offer the skills to the public too, not just the trade.
The idea was to run a course in spring and autumn, but it snowballed.
This last year we've run 24 in the hotel, plus one a month in
Manchester, as well as seminars at big exhibitions -- and travelling to
the US.''
Scots and Americans are the most enthusiastic audiences, she has
found. Previously she demonstrated at Glasgow's SECC, but on this
occasion the two-day roadshow is being held in the Stirling Management
Centre at Stirling University.
A total of 13 courses will be held over the two days, and will include
Maureen's 2[1/2]-hour seminars on Step-by-step Classic Curtain Making:
Stunning Top Treatments -- Valances and Pelmets: Tailored Covers: A New
Look at Swags and Tails. Caroline Higgs's hands-on courses of two hours
duration, using sewing machines to achieve perfection through the use of
professional shortcuts, should also be popular.
Helen Morris owns, with her partner, The Stencil Library in
Northumberland and has a range of over 1000 stencils, including many
very unusual examples. Well-known in her field, she will show techniques
suitable for walls, fabrics, furniture and other surfaces in interior
design.
Judith Lassen's skills as professional artist, teacher and designer
will enable people to Make Colour Work For You in workshops lasting
2[1/2] hours. Each course costs #25.
''The public can't go to trade shows, and there's no public show for
products of this quality,'' says Maureen. ''The roadshow means anyone
can come along and see what's on offer in fabrics, accessories and so
on, and the manufacturers will tell them where they can get them.''
Maureen's future tip for window dressing is a current fashion in
America: Roman blinds with an update. ''They are doing stunning things
which add softness to the basic Roman blind -- hobbled finishes, for
example, which add fullness at each fold, so that when it's fully down
it's not just flat fabric. The layers can be trimmed with tapes and
braids with the same idea repeated on perhaps a pelmet, a tailored
valance or maybe even a swag on a pole across the top.''
* Entry to exhibition: #6 (includes tea/coffee and biscuit). For
information and bookings for courses, ring 017684-86272.
