THE end of the old war meant that the old certainties vanished
virtually overnight.
Britain's role in the world up to then had been fairly clear. We were
a medium sized power with an influence based on our past as an imperial
power, reinforced by a relationship with the United States perceived as
special, although how special it was from moment to moment, and crisis
to crisis, varied wildly.
The world's perception was what mattered, not the reality, because it
lent us influence greater than the reality merited. The cement in the
relationship was the common enemy, the Soviet Union, a cement which has
crumbled away.
Those days are past, those conditions no longer prevail. Where do we
go now? It is a question worth posing in the context of Britain's
domestic politics.
The Euro-phobes seek to detach us from Europe, because, although they
pay lip service to continued membership of the European Union, what they
are seeking to achieve would mean the union proceeding without us, and
our influence on how it proceeded becoming negligible.
Maybe that would be a good thing. Maybe we should be a small power on
the fringe. Should we persist in playing in the major league, or face
facts and accept relegation to the third division? If we did, would we
be facing facts, or abandoning a tenable role?
At the end of next month these issues will be addressed at a one-day
conference, held in London, organised by the Foreign Office and Chatham
House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a body which exists
to ask large questions.
The initiative appears to have come from Mr Douglas Hurd and fell on
fertile ground because Chatham House is celebrating its 75th anniversary
and such a conference had never been held before.
It is no secret that Foreign Secretary has been trying for some time
to shift the focus of British foreign policy from Europe to the wider
world, although so far this year the antics of the hormonally boosted,
if mentally impaired, Euro-phobes have prevented him from securing that
aim. The conference should refocus things.
The Foreign Secretary was harping on this favourite theme last Friday
in Glasgow, when he spoke to the Scottish Oil Clubs annual dinner.
The post cold war world was richer and wider in opportunity and
openness, perhaps than ever before in our lifetimes, he said. Navigating
it would mean tackling some bumpy passages, but this was not a time for
taking in sail, more one for catching the wind of opportunity.
He argued that the world was keen to learn the lessons Britain could
teach it, and to be taught the skills we had mastered -- those of our
armed forces, our police, our diplomacy, our science, our technology,
our democracy, and our industry.
''By sustaining a global vision and a global reach in our policies, I
am sure we can continue to supply this demand to the great benefit of
the British economy and of the British people,'' he added. No little
Essex Englander he.
So what can this conference achieve? Rome was not built in a day and
British foreign policy, leaving aside party differences, will not be
changed in one either, but the list of participants is impressive.
The Prime Minister will launch the proceedings, and the Prince of
Wales, who more than anyone else must be deeply concerned about
Britain's role in the next century -- there are kings and kings, after
all, and one's standing does depend on the standing of one's kingdom --
will speak.
So will Mr Hurd, Mr Robin Cook, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, and a
host of others drawn from the ranks of the great and the good in the
professions, the arts, the media, and business. Of the 500 people
expected to attend, 50 will be guests from overseas invited to share
their perspective of Britain in the world.
The aim is to examine four areas: Britain's diplomatic and security
role; our place in the world economy; our role in encouraging
development and political and economic reform; and how we should project
our values, education and, culture.
Apart from the speechifying, there will be breakaway groups who will
look at these areas in which delegates with relevant expertise will
participate.
The departments and organisations whose work will come under scrutiny
are the Foreign Office, Trade and Industry, Overseas Development, and
the British Council. Do they give value for money? Are there better ways
of doing what they do? Do we need what they do?
Professor Sir Laurence Martin, the institute's director, said the
conference meant that Britain's foreign policy establishment was
prepared to go into court for the day and expose itself to criticism and
comment. He was not aware of anything like that happening before in
Britain -- or anywhere else.
Sir Michael Pike, the Foreign Secretary's special representative, said
it was a unique event. It would a day for standing back and asking how
we did things, how we could do them better, he added. One did not
necessarily find the answers to problems, if one did this in
conventional diplomatic terms.
It was a cliche to talk about Great Britain plc, but the idea was to
bring everyone together, from the head of Glaxo to a dancer from the
Royal Ballet, and find how their skills could be used more effectively
in a competitive world.
''We will have actresses alongside businessmen,'' he said. Leaving
aside that it was ever thus, a serious point was being made. The kind of
questions that will be asked are what it is business wants from the
Government, how the partnership between Government and business might be
improved, and what the Government's role in trade promotion should be.
Commercial promotion is the largest area of work done by our overseas
missions, and it is important to be assess whether this is work that
requires a diplomatic post, whether it might not be done by other means,
whether the way it is done meets the needs of business.
Then there are what are perceived as our assets to consider, the
intangible things we have to sell. These include our know how, our
experience of privatisation -- a tricky area to say the least, given
what some of the leaders of our privatised industries have got up once
unloaded onto the free market -- our financial expertise, and the skills
gained over the centuries as one of the world's great trading nations.
Can these assets be better deployed? Will the conference produce any
answers? Will the answers be palatable? Will anybody take heed of what
is proposed? Will they even agree on anything? Sir Laurence said that
the institute was very excited about the event. Sir Michael said it
would be intriguing to see what the mix would produce. ''We don't know,
and that is one of the fascinations of this event,'' he added.

MAKING it to the heart of Europe was a tricky business last week. I
reported to Edinburgh Airport at the crack of dawn but there was no sign
of Sabena. ''The ''plane is in Glasgow,'' I was informed, not over
politely by the way, ''and you will be taken to it by bus''.
Couldn't the aircraft fly, as it was supposed to, the 50 miles quicker
than we could be driven? Don't ask. As I discovered many years ago,
logic has absolutely nothing to do with air travel.
When our little group arrived in Glasgow, we took everyone by
surprise, particularly the officers of HM Immigration service, who
appeared to have emigrated. After some hesitation, and a plea from the
airline to embark with all speed, we were permitted to take to the
skies.
Running more than two and a half hours late now, I missed a
presentation by the North Sea Commission, but they sportingly provided
lunch anyway. My English colleagues on the EU Committee of the Regions
have decided that they will not go unrefreshed if they stick close to
the Scots.
The day was starting to improve and it got better still. We were
delighted to welcome to our ranks the boys and girls from Austria,
Finland, and Sweden. They might be described as Euro-enthusiasts.
The Austrian representative reminded us his country had voted by a
two-thirds majority to join the union. ''We are a federal Alpine state
and we are greatly honoured to be part of this organisation.'' I'm not
sure about Alps, pal, but I am certain we Brits are not allowed to be
federal.
Our new-found Finnish friend informed us that people in his country
paid between 15 and 20% of their incomes towards local taxation. ''Only
10% of council cash comes from central government.'' I like that idea,
it makes for genuine accountablility, but the British centralists, of
both main parties, would never devolve such power.
In the Finnish Parliament 40% of the MPs are women, which probably
accounts for the common sense funding for local government.
The Swedish speaker told us he came from a country that was not a
federal state. ''We want to see more transparency and openness in the
EU,'' he declared, and so say all of us. What we don't want any more of,
however, is the British Government sounding as though they really don't
want to be members of the club at all, the old ''diet of Brussels'' line
which lost the Tories so many Euro-MPs.
I have been fiercely critical of the Labour Party's eagerness to
abandon any principle in the pursuit of power; one should also record
despair at the Government's readiness to do almost anything to retain
it. Trying to find sops for the English nationalists is a pretty grubby
business.
The dismal standing of politicians in any table of respect owes much
to their cowardice, in particular their unwillingness to tell unpopular
truths. Here is a fact which the Prime Minister would do well to trumpet
loud and clear: we are not going to pull out of the EU, because to do so
would be economic and political madness.
Instead of saying that, as Geoffrey Howe so powerfully put it: ''UK
foreign policy is being dragged into a ghetto of sentimentality and
self-delusion'', and all to appease a group of people one would not
entrust to run a Sunday School picnic.
What sovereign power would we be able to use, were we to be divorced
from Brussels? The power to work even longer hours than we do at the
moment? The power to pay even lower wages? The power to keep bent
bananas and British bangers? We could indeed reduce taxation by using
some of the cash which goes to the EU. But at what cost?
The major Japanese companies, and some American ones, operate in the
UK partly because we have a reasonable system of infrastructure and
welfare, and certainly because of grants available from the EU. Take
either of these props away and they will be off like a ferret down a
hole. Scotland would be the biggest British sufferer, as Ian Lang would
be happy to confirm.
And what is the political reality of the European Union from which we
have so much to fear? It is dominated by Conservatives. Dr Kohl and Mr
Balladur are not men of the left, nor is Mr Santer.
They run or ran countries which are both civilised and successful.
Would we be better off trying to strike up some kind of alliance with
Bill Clinton or Newt Gingrich? Include me out.
Get real. There is, as a famous lady once said, no alternative, no
turning back. The Empire is finished, we will not be going to war over
Hong Kong, and this country is not about to become mightier yet. We can
learn to live with our neighbours, play a leading part in one of the
most powerful trading blocks in the world, or we can live in Enid-Blyton
land.
If the Conservative Party is not prepared to stand up and be counted,
then they will fall and be counted out.
The last time I defended the EU, Mr James Anderson -- a doughty Tory
fighter in his day -- demanded to know if I had vested interests in
Europe. I have. They are called Rebecca, Matthew, Samantha, and Jessica
and the oldest of them is nearly four.

EUROPE and Northern Ireland, the two biggest British political issues
of the post-war era, have come coincidentally to a watershed.
From now on in the Commons, Mr Major can feel more confident in
calling the Ulster Unionists' bluff when they threaten to bring down the
Government.
In today's political climate the Conservatives would be massacred in
an election. The Protestant majority would be inviting Labour -- never a
natural ally of Ulster Unionism -- to map their fate.
For the Unionists to scupper the Tories now would be to repeat the
SNP's mass suicide of 1979 when, in Jim Callaghan's memorable words, the
turkeys voted for Christmas.
Properly handled, the Irish question could yet help to save Major's
premiership. Europe will have a role, mainly economic, to play in
reinforcing the peace. But Europe, mishandled on the wider scale, could
destroy Mr Major and the Government too.
In the past few weeks the Conservative's panic-driven behaviour in
Europe has become increasingly eccentric.
In the now famous Frost interview Mr Major announced, in effect, that
he would not negotiate at the negotiations when he turned up at next
year's inter-governmental conference on Maastricht 2. That was an
extraordinary decision of huge importance.
A veto would be slapped on ending the veto. No new powers for the
European Parliament would be entertained. A single currency? Don't make
me laugh, he said, in so many words.
It was an extraordinary performance, threatening a return to the days
when de Gaulle left the French chair empty in the Council of Ministers
and paralysed Europe.
A few days later Mr Hurd had to be slapped down in Cabinet, as
Ministers were suddenly propelled into joining a Cabinet consensus which
is more Euro-sceptic than ever before.
Pro-Europeans such as Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine are forced into
acquiescence and uncharacteristic reticence. Mr Rifkind makes the right
sounds and voices support for the new get-tough doctrine, although he is
noticeably lacking in enthusiasm, refusing, for example, to deny the
need for a single currency.
As each nightmarish day passes, the Prime Minister knows the moment of
reckoning in Europe approaches when he must make begin backing up his
rhetoric with hard action.
In leading the Cabinet lurch towards the Euro-sceptic standpoint, he
has signalled that he intends to deal with Europe head-on. Around the
rest of the European Union there is puzzlement and worry.
Mr Major's desperate tactic has served one useful purpose. He is
forcing the EU to conclude finally that he cannot go on like this, if
Britain is to remain a mover and shaker in the union. Some conjecture
is, therefore, the order of the day in Brussels.
First, there is the option -- probably the least likely -- that Mr
Major will go into Maastricht 2 and simply turn up his toes knowing he
is defeated in advance.
He could make concessions and return to the Commons, where he would
put on as bright a gloss as possible on diplomatic defeat. He is not
exactly inexperienced in that area. The safe bet is he would be gone
soon after.
Second, there is the scenario where in plays the party-pooper and
insists on all manner of opt-outs and derogations on any policies which
freak the sceptics. It would be a long list but as a game plan it could,
just, be workable.
Committed Europeans abhor opt-outs, but some have come to see them as
a necessary evil in keeping the EU in one piece in the early years of
the next millennium. Under this option Britain would be placed on the
fringe of the EU, cast in the role of second-class member, a sort of
offshore adjunct with no political clout in the club.
Third, there is the option to which Mr Major must of necessity be
warming. It is the Union Jack election, in which the Tory English
nationalists are given free rein to go Euro-bashing, as the Maastricht 2
negotiation reaches its climax.
In this way Mr Major could go to the country, demanding a mandate to
keep Britain out of the murkier depths of ever closer political and
economic union.
This offers him more hope than the first two options. Recent polls
have shown Euro-scepticism gaining ground in Britain, even in
EU-friendly Scotland and Wales.
A jingoistic, Euro-phobic campaign might be just the ticket for the
Tories, especially if they have by then managed to whip up sufficient
public alarm and resentment in the Maastricht 2 debate.
To win this way, Mr Major needs time. Maastricht took 12 months to
negotiate and there is every indication that Maastricht 2 could take
longer. It could, therefore, still be in full swing by the time Mr
Major's electoral time is up in April 1997.
Around the European capitals and in Brussels these days the thought is
dawning that a dazzlingly simple solution to the British problem
beckons. How simple life would be for the EU if Mr Major and his
self-destructing party's wrecking role were simply removed from the
process.
Imagine a British Labour government with a Euro-sceptic wing which is
containable; an administration with a genuine commitment to Europe, one
which would sign up for the social chapter and stop playing silly
buggers with the veto. It could be closer than you think.
Which brings us to the fourth option.
This is the one beyond Mr Major's control, where the British Tories
are allowed to party poop for all they are worth, until the moment
arrives when they must face an election -- and lose.
All the European Union has to do is nothing in particular and, pace W
S Gilbert, do it very well. Europeans, after all, are used to that kind
of thing. It is not difficult.
To help the Tories on their way and outflank Mr Major on option three,
Mr Blair must champion the benefits of Britain in Europe (it is time
someone pointed out that they do exist) and embrace the single currency.
Monetary union would be a godsend to a Labour administration, freeing
it forever from the historic embarrassment of forced devaluations. A
bout of dignified patriotism from Labour could be mixed with its
instinctive grassroots faith in internationalism -- a powerful antidote
to the misanthropy of the little Englander nationalists.
And we haven't even discussed banana skins.

EVERY state in the USA annually plays host to its own Olympic-style
games. In Oklahoma, those festivities are known as ''the Sooner State
Games'' and comprise a full programme of athletics events for all age
groups plus competitions in an untold number of other sports.
It's a safe bet, though, that no competitor in any state games
anywhere is older than Margaret White from Turpin, Oklahoma, who took
first place in her age group in the women's shot putt.
Of course, given that Margaret is 100 years old, her victory could
have been predicted -- she was the only participant in that age
division. Still, her winning mark of 11ft 4in would have put many a
90-year-old youngster to shame.
Athletic excellence actually runs in Margaret's family. Her son,
Wendell Palmer, competes in athletics almost as enthusiastically as his
mother.
Like her, he specialises in the field events, putting the shot and
throwing the discus, although he also runs in the sprints. If you think
all that sounds a bit taxing for a man of 62, so does his mother.
''Wendell is of an age that I don't think he ought to do it much
longer,'' she said.
* THE last time the Summer Olympic Games were staged in the USA was
1984, when they were hosted by the city of Los Angeles. Next year, the
Games return to the States, with Atlanta taking its turn in the
spotlight. Inevitably, the lessons of Los Angeles have been well learned
and are being borne in mind by the Atlanta neophytes.
LA was the first Games of many to actually return a profit and, in the
finest American tradition, profit is very much to the forefront with the
current organising committee. There are billions of dollars in potential
revenue on the line and Atlanta intends to make the most of every
money-spinning opportunity.
Consequently, just about anything that can carry an Olympic Games tag
has had one affixed -- for a price. There are official TV and radio
stations, official credit cards, official beers and soft drinks, and
now, in a consummate show of Americanisation, an official game show.
Actually, two of them.
Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, the two most popular game shows on US
television, have received the Olympic seal of approval.
Both will feature questions and trivia relating to the Olympic Games.
For many who prefer to conceive the Olympics as sport rather than
commerce, the question to be answered about these shows is: ''Why?''
* AT 65 years old, golfing legend Arnold Palmer has finally admitted
that age is getting to him. He recently announced that this year's Open
Championship will be his last and that he will not commit to playing any
further tournaments. Asked to explain his reasoning, Palmer commented:
''When you get to my age, you don't even buy green bananas any more.''
Presumably, he means that he's reached a ripe old age.
* ELECTRONIC mail used to be the wave of the future. Now, it's the
wave of the present. And it can be used for just about any conceivable
purpose.
For example, at one time, if you were the owner of a professional
sports team and you decided that it was time to sell, you had to enter
into feverish and highly stressful negotiations, usually behind closed
doors. Now, thanks to e-mail, you can do it hassle-free.
That's what Bruce Firestone -- or someone claiming to be Firestone --
did recently in placing the financially troubled Canadian football
league team, Ottowa Rough Riders, on the open market.
The message, flashed across Canada and the USA, read: ''Football
franchise for sale. Great past, potential expanding American market,
well staffed with professional consultants. Has experienced problems,
but is now a well-oiled machine. Prefer to sell to someone in town, or
trade for a nice piece of land.''
That land, of course, should not have goalposts or markings, and
should not be encircled by public seating.
* JUST in case you were wondering, the world record for 24-hour
stair-climbing now stands at 85,420.
That's the number of steps Ron Dossenbach covered recently in climbing
to the top of Detroit's Westin Hotel 78 times.
The question is, did he walk back down each time or take the lift?

GRAHAM Thorpe is ready, willing, and able to take over from the old
guard in England's new order.
And, on the evidence of yesterday's impressive half-century, best mate
Mark Ramprakash will be alongside when England's cricketers tackle the
West Indies next summer without Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting.
Last weekend in Adelaide, Thorpe and John Crawley responded to Gooch's
retirement announcement by playing vital innings to set up victory over
Australia.
A week later, Thorpe did better still by scoring the second Test
century of his career and Ramprakash contributed 72 to England's
rearguard action after Gatting had confirmed that he, too, will be
quitting at the end of this Ashes series.
Despite a stand of 158 between Thorpe and Ramprakash, England
surrendered a first innings lead of 107 to Australia. And, by the close
of play, that deficit had been almost doubled with the home side
reaching 87 for two second time around.
Thorpe walked to the middle on Saturday with his country in desperate
trouble at five for two. By the time he fell to Shane Warne for 123, the
follow-on threat had been well and truly banished.
A five-hour innings, studded with 19 boundaries, took his series
aggregate to 444 and his Test average this winter to 55.5.
Another crop of injuries led to England summoning Ramprakash from the
A tour of India. His response on Perth's fast and bouncy pitch was a
highly disciplined, four-hour contribution of 72.
The end of Thorpe's innings -- stumped while giving Warne the charge
-- sparked an afternoon slump that saw England lose their last six
wickets for 60 runs.
And with Mark Taylor and Michael Slater putting together their sixth
half-century opening stand of the series, Australia are on course to
complete a 3-1 scoreline.

THE India and England A teams were warned by the umpires in Chandigarh
yesterday for excessive appealing and verbal intimidation.
Umpires Kuncha Parthasarthy and Roy Choudhary called both captains and
team managers in for a clear-the-air meeting following the second day of
the third Test.
Earlier the umpires had warned India A captain Vikram Rathore about
the constant appealing of his team, while English batsman Dominic Cork
looked at one stage to complain to the officials about something that
had been said.
England A captain Alan Wells said: ''The umpires are in control of the
game and all parties are happy following the meeting.''
Wells top-scored yesterday with 42 but the loss of five wickets after
tea left England A struggling at 145 for seven in reply to India A's
first innings total of 229.

BRUCE Flockhart lifted his second Hydro-Electric Scottish National
singles badminton title at Meadowbank in Edinburgh yesterday and claimed
winning was just getting easier.
The 22-year-old Stirling University sports scholarship student
defeated Jim Mailer for the second year in a row in confident style,
this time by 15-6, 15-12.
''It wasn't such a mental battle to win this time around,'' said
Flockhart, whose mother Joanna won the women's title seven times.
''I was much more in control of the game and made Jim take all the
risks.''
Mailer, who had considered retiring last year but stayed in the game
with the hope of creating an upset at the championships, gave no hints
whether his defeat would mark the end of his career.
''It looks like it's back to the drawing board,'' said the 26-year-old
former Scottish champion, who visibly suffered as the rallies with
Flockhart grew longer.
Meanwhile, his opponent was planning his build up to the world
championships in Switzerland, including playing in the Swiss and
Austrian Opens over the next few months.
In the women's event, Anne Gibson lifted her sixth title when she
defeated Gillian Martin of Barnt Green by 11-5, 11-2. The British
Olympic squad member admitted she had been worried with two weeks to go
to the championships, particularly with Martin playing well and herself
suffering from a cold, but she bounced back to control the pace of the
game well. Final results:
Men's singles: B Flockhart (Stirling University) beat J Mailer
(Stirling) 15-6, 15-12. Women's singles: A Gibson (Marlow) beat G Martin
(Barnt Green) 11-5, 11-2. Men's doubles: R Hogg (Dunfermline) and K
Middlemiss (Edinburgh) beat A Gatt (Edinburgh) and C Robertson
(Fauldhouse) 15-5, 15-2. Mixed doubles: K Middlemiss and E Allen
(Edinburgh) beat G Haldane and G Haldane (Kirkcaldy) 18-16, 18-14.

LESLEY Beck, the 30-year-old three times British Slalom champion Beck
took both Slalom and Combined titles at the North of Scotland Senior Ski
Championships over the weekend.
Ross Gardner, 16, of the KPMG Scottish B Squad, dominated the weekend
in the men's events. After training well in Austria over Christmas and
being prevented from completing the full scheduled race programme due to
a lack of race-quality snow, Gardner was obviously hungry for real
competition and proved head and shoulders above the opposition in both
disciplines. Results:
Slalom -- Men: 1, R Gardner (Scottish SC); 2, Murray Macadam
(Cairngorm SC); 3, E Lucas (Scottish SC). Women: 1, L Beck (Bearsden
SC); 2, E Adam (Bearsden SC); 3, C Wright (Aberdeen SC).
Giant Slalom -- Men: 1, Gardner; 2, Macadam; 3, Lucas. Women: 1, Adam;
2, Beck; 3, K Leitch (Muckhart) 50.81.

TOM Shields has been running a diary for years with a Nae Luck award
to go with it.
Well I win it. So does Dumfries. And also the Scottish Tug of War
Association, and maybe the sports desk of this blatt as well.
For I was sent to go off boldly to the small but eminent town of
Dumfries to cover the International Ladies 1995 Tug of War U K Indoor
Championships, held at the rather nice Loreburn Hall in the town in
which our national bard, wur ain Rabbie, eventually croaked it.
It is sensible that the town of the poet's demise should be the centre
of celebration for Rabbie's 200th anniversary, and considering that
Dumfries has the mausoleum and the stookie, well Dumfries should be
given the accolade.
Everybody in Dumfries told me that at the weekend. But they also told
me about the Tug o' War. And of course they did.
I met Bob Farmer, the chairman of S T O W A, a famous fellow in this
sport. He was abject in his apologies. Me and photographer Eddie Jones,
had travelled all this way to see all the wummin at the old tug. We were
to be disappointed.
Wales and Northern Ireland scratched. Too many injuries. Jersey were
only sending chaps anyway.
When I got into the hall, I was convinced -- we turned up in time for
the ladies' competitions -- that the Guernsey girls were winning. Wrong.
I thought most of them were really rather tasty but they were all men.
The ''girl'' with long blonde hair turned out to be a chap from
Guernsey called Baird Page, and had a ''baird'' which would have done
justice to James Robertson, film star of that ilk.
Baird was a very rough looking chap indeed, no matter what he looked
like from behind. They had a squad of nine with them and were enjoying
the event immensely. Especially the nights. If you look like Gerard
Depardieu, you are going to enjoy especially the nights.
So the wummin were garaged. No international. Disappointing
circumstances. You had better believe that girls can make the best of
it. Only Scotland and England were left to compete, so they did.
Dammit, England beat Scotland by three-nil. Now I know this Scotland
ladies' team. They are from East Kilbride, and mainly from the Inland
Revenue, and the best team in Scotland. You think the Inland throw their
weight about with your tax returns: you should see them at the Tug o'
War. They lost to a young, generally inexperienced English team.
The oldest girl, Sue Williamson, was more than 40 and weighed about
eight stone. She looked like Nastassia Kinsky. The biggest girls were
the youngest and weighed a lot more.
They were the three sisters from the English national representatives,
Leek, from Staffordshire.
Like many other so-called minority sports, countries are represented
by sides who have won in their own leagues. Leek are likely to do well
in the next Commonwealth Games.
Tug of War was, until 1920, a sport with Olympic status. As the
national sport, in Switzerland particularly, but very big in Spain too,
tug of war will probably make it. But let me tell you about the English
team, representing one of the wee Five Towns of Staffordshire, one which
Arnold Bennet, no less, wrote about.
The girls are called Johnson and come from their own wee town. One is
called Wendy, one is Dianne, and the other is Tracy. Put out of your
minds about big heavy girls. These are certainly taller than me but a
lot better looking. A lot younger-looking as well.
Tracy is 25, Wendy 28, and Dianne 30 and had three children. All three
of them I interviewed in a pub called the Hole In The Wall. All three of
them drank enough pints of lager to put even a journalist to shame. And
all three of them were absolutely smashing. They had enoyed themselves.
There is no money in this sport. The Scottish Sports Council does a
great deal better by Tug of War -- essentially a sport deriving from
farm-workers -- than the English can manage. But the boys and girls
enjoy it and revel in the sport and the bonhomie.
But in case you think this is just a bevvy job, and not a sport, think
again. Much of what one has to do to make it is similar to, say, rowing.
You need heavy legs and pelvis, technique with your feet, and as in
every sport, the right temperament.
As in every minority sport, too, you need a sense of companionship, of
fair play, and of decent competitiveness.
I am afraid -- sorry, Sue Williamson -- generally you need youth. But
most of all you need exuberance, and Sue made up in that what she did
not in the lightest of years.
Last August, I saw exuberance in a legendary figure in the Tug of War,
wrote about him . . . Sid Jones, a man whose word was law in rope
pulling.
Sid died in December of this year. You think that was a Nae Luck
award? Wrang. He died honoured and enjoying himself. I enjoyed myself at
the weekend, and honour to all who come after Sid at that.

SANTIAGO Luna, a 32-year-old journeyman Spanish professional whose
highest placing in 10 years on the European Tour had been fourth three
times, yesterday brought an end to the search for his first victory when
he won the Madeira Island Open -- which he had led after every round on
his own -- by a convincing four strokes.
That was the margin which Luna had in hand after 54 holes, and his
closing score of 70 for a total of 272, 16 under par, meant that his
achievement and the possession of the first prize of #41,660 by this son
of an electrician who works at Madrid's Puerta de Hierro club, was never
seriously threatened.
The 24-year-old Tahiti born Frenchman, Christian Cevaer, who was
penalised #500 on Friday for the snail-like pace of his play, earned far
in excess of that fine by taking second place and #27,770 with a final
round of 69 to finish three strokes ahead of Paul Curry.
Among the five players who tied on 281 for fourth place was Dean
Robertson, whose 70 concluded a promising baptism of fire as a tour
member, and was worth #9120 to him. Robertson, who had already gained
entry to this week's Canary Islands Open, was, needless to say,
delighted.
In a fresh wind, which lost some of its saw-tooth as sunshine broke
through the overcast, and on firm greens further defended by exacting
pin positions, Robertson made a flying start with four birdies in the
first seven holes. The next two each cost him a stroke, but he then
ground out nine par figures.
Afterwards Robertson, aged 24 and two years ago a Walker Cup player
and the Scottish amateur champion, said: ''If you had given me a 70
before the start, I'd have chopped my hands off for it.
''I felt the pressure of trying to play my best without having played
much recently. After the bogeys, I just tried to keep my head and avoid
further mistakes.''
The strength of Luna's golf rested on his mastery of the four long
holes on the 6606-yard Madeira Club's course, perched dramatically 2300
feet above the Atlantic. He played them in 11 under par to help confirm
the view of both Severiano Ballesteros and a Spanish sports psychologist
that he was good enough to win.
When he bogeyed the fourth, Cevaer, who had birdied the first two
holes, was within three strokes, but the wedge to six feet to birdie the
next repulsed any thought of a deepening crisis.
Cevaer, who was educated in America, almost had his grip on second
place loosened at the long twelfth when he lost his second shot in the
ravine short of the green. But he saved par from 20 feet, and the birdie
made at the short seventeenth by the runner-up in last November's
qualifying school cemented his place.
On a day when only 24 of the 72 qualifiers broke par and David J
Russell's 66 was the lowest of the nine below 70, Paul Lawrie was
reasonably satisfied both with a 72 and his equal twelfth finish.
Leading final aggregates (British and Irish unless stated):
272 -- S Luna (Spain) 67, 67, 68, 70 (#41,660).
276 -- C Cevaer (France) 70, 69, 68, 69 (#27,770).

THE fates refuse to allow Ally McCoist respite. The Rangers' striker,
who has been plagued by a variety of injuries for the past two years,
was hobbling around on crutches yesterday and will go into hospital this
morning to have a damaged ankle x-rayed, writes James Traynor.
McCoist, believing his injury problems to be behind him, was
reintroduced to the first team 12 minutes from time in the game against
Dundee United on Saturday, but was limping badly after less than a
minute.
Brian Laudrup played an enticing ball into United's penalty box, and
both McCoist and keeper Kelham O'Hanlon went for it. O'Hanlon won, and
the Rangers player was left on the ground.
McCoist managed to get back to his feet, but was in obvious
discomfort. Perhaps his enthusiasm and desire to resume normal service
after all his previous setbacks robbed him of proper judgment as he
tried to play on when he should have gone off. Now he and the club are
hoping the x-ray does not show serious damage to his left ankle.
Once again, however, McCoist was on the sidelines yesterday as the
Rangers' first-team squad went through a relaxed training session in
preparation for tonight's cup tie against Hamilton.
McCoist must feel he has been singled out for special maltreatment.
Since he broke a leg playing for Scotland in a World Cup qualifying tie
in Lisbon almost two years ago he has been denied an extended run
without injury.
The striker, only one away from his three hundredth competitive goal
for the Ibrox club, has suffered hamstring, calf, and groin injuries.
Meanwhile, Rangers will have to do without the striker's services at
Firhill. The winners meet either Hearts or Clydebank, who replay
tomorrow night at Tynecastle, in the next round.
Falkirk and Motherwell, left in the dark at Brockville last midweek
when the floodlights failed at half time, meet again tonight.
The Fir Park side are worried about the fitness of striker Tommy
Coyne, taken off eight minutes into the second half against Celtic on
Saturday. ''He has an ankle injury and is doubtful,'' manager Alex
McLeish said.
Dougie Arnott hurt a thigh and Billy Davies damaged a knee, but both
are expected to be fit.

Tottenham 3, Blackburn 1
JURGEN Klinsmann savoured a nutcracker sweet against Tottenham old boy
Bobby Mimms as Blackburn's Premiership lead was pegged back to a
precarious two points after a pulsating game at White Hart Lane.
The 31-year-old goalkeeper, plunged into his first full game of the
season when England's Tim Flowers was ruled out, suffered as the German
ace drilled Spurs' opener through his legs.
He was then left flat-footed when Darren Anderton's 30th-minute shot
clipped Colin Hendry's right knee and deflected past him.
Tim Sherwood revived Kenny Dalglish's hopes with a well-taken goal at
the start of the second half, but Mimms had no chance as Nick Barmby
flew in to head his eighth goal of the season 11 minutes from time.
It was only Blackburn's fourth Premiership defeat, and a result to
delight champions Manchester United,who are now just two points adrift.
Blackburn manager Kenny Dalglish shrugged off suggestions Rovers are
cracking under the pressure of trying to stay in front of champions
United.
''We're terrified,'' grinned Dalglish. ''We look at the league table,
we're still top by two points and our goal difference is not too bad.
We'll keep plugging on!
''We'll play a lot worse and come out with three points. We're
disappointed with the result but not with the way we played.''
Spurs manager Gerry Francis hailed his side's performance as their
best since he took over from Ossie Ardiles.
''In the first half I was proud of the players -- they were
outstanding.''

WALTER Smith was busy yesterday checking the fitness of his players
after their game against Dundee United.
But while most of those who took knocks and suffered bruising should
be available for tonight's Tennents Scottish Cup, third-round tie
against Hamilton at Firhill, the Rangers' manager will have to concern
himself with a more pressing problem -- perhaps even one which could be
described as a recurring anxiety.
The problem in question is Andy Goram.
If the Rangers' keeper is not the best in British football he is
certainly one of only a handful of players on this island who could be
regarded as world class. But he continues to make it hard for the Ibrox
side to keep him in employment.
Goram's personal affairs can overshadow his football career because of
his own excesses and those of a voracious and unmerciful tabloid press.
A club such as Rangers, which must be increasingly mindful of the
corporate image, cannot always turn a blind eye to happenings off the
pitch.
There is a limit to what can, and cannot, be accepted even from the
most exceptional talent, and Goram has to realise he is in danger of
throwing it all away because of an apparent inability to live the life
of a true professional footballer.
Currently injured, Goram is having to handle the traumas associated
with seeing his private life plastered in shop windows; and not for the
first time.
Yet, so far in his time at Ibrox, he has continued to be an inspiring
figure in goal and often has been the difference between Rangers winning
and losing.
Frankly, there is not another goalkeeper like him in the vicinity; but
he must know his inherent talents will not protect him from Rangers'
wrath much longer.
Indeed, if Goram, who has 32 caps for Scotland, continues to dominate
some headlines for reasons that have little relation to his work, he
will force Walter Smith and the club's chairman, David Murray, to act.
The keeper has already stretched their tolerance levels. One more
indiscretion could well cost him his place.
When Goram returns to Ibrox today, he and the manager will probably
have an intense discussion during which the facts of footballing life
will be explained to the keeper, whose memory of having been placed on
the transfer list once previously may still be vivid.
That happened last summer, but resulted because of his attitude
towards work and a fitness programme, not because of his private
affairs.
The keeper responded magnificently, and he will have to do so again,
otherwise he may be lost to the Scottish game.
In fact, Goram could be lost to the entire game, for if Rangers decide
they cannnot accept his excesses any longer, who else would be willing
to take the risk?
Goram must be careful not to test the loyalty of his employers
further.
The club are fortunate in that they are 15 points clear of the rest in
the premier division, but the quest for a seventh successive title and
the problem of their wayward keeper will be put to one side tonight when
Rangers try for the third time to beat Hamilton.
Their tie has been postponed twice because Firhill was unplayable, and
both sides are now desperate to get the ball rolling.
''I expect it will be a typical Scottish Cup tie,'' Smith said, ''and
I don't think there is any danger of my players relaxing in the belief
that they will win without striving for the best form.
''In the past they have handled this kind of test well enough.''

BRUCE Cuthill delayed the wetting of the head of his second child,
born just a few days ago, until last night. And what a celebration it
turned out to be, for not only did his hockey club Menzieshill complete
the league and cup double yesterday at the Bell's Sports Centre in
Perth, but the mercurial Cuthill was voted player of the final.
This was no less than Cuthill deserved, for it was his brilliant
stickwork and vision which set up a number of Menzieshill's goals to put
them on their way to a 6-4 victory over arch rivals MIM.
The women's final also saw one player, Edinburgh Ladies goalkeeper
Linda McLean, reach a degree of excellence. She made two superb saves
during normal time in a two-all draw with Western Klick Photopoint, but
it was her brilliance in the penalty shootout which ensured Edinburgh of
their first cup triumph since 1991.
So while the diminutive McLean was putting up the shutters, Pauline
Robertson, Sharon Bissett, and Gill Messenger scored, and so Edinburgh
Ladies are now on the threshold of their first league-and-cup double.

THE winter of Melanie Neef's athletics content should reach new
heights next weekend when, barring a selectorial brainstorm, she will
partner World and Olympic champion Sally Gunnell for Britain in their
international match against France at the Kelvin Hall.
Neef posted her ninth Scottish record-breaking time inside a month to
win the AAA 400 metres title in Birmingham on Saturday, slicing .09sec
from her own national best with a time of 52.82, and moving to third on
the British all-time list behind Gunnell and Verona Elder.
The UK team for next Saturday's Glasgow international will be
announced this morning. Barring the capricious whims of selectors -- a
not unknown hazard -- Gunnell and Neef will be Britain's 400m pairing.
The French squad, yet to be announced, holds the possibility of an
appearance by Marie-Jose Perec, the Olympic, World, and European 400m
champion, who is switching to hurdles outdoors this year with the avowed
intention of removing Gunnell's world record.
''I hope they both run,'' said Neef, first Scot to win this title
since Linsey Macdonald in 1985, and whose records she has now eclipsed.
''I was on my own after 130 metres on Saturday. Competition like Sally,
or Perec, especially in front of my home crowd, will really draw me
out.''
The AAA title, on the sixtieth anniversary of these championships, was
Neef's first individual contest this year over the distance at which she
reached Commonwealth and European outdoor finals last summer, and
victory removed the demons of doubt which stalk during the dark months.
''All these records at 60 and 200 metres this winter did not matter,''
said Neef. ''It is great to have done them, but they were not in the
event which I regard as my real one.
''These times just put pressure on me. After my heat and semi
(54.76sec and 53.67), I wondered where the improvement was going to come
from. I felt as if I was running through mud -- desperately hard work.''
But her final time was the fastest in the championships by any British
winner ever. Coach Bob Inglis dismisses her doubts. ''You don't want to
listen to Mel,'' he said. ''She could whinge for Britain, never mind
run.''
Next Saturday's match will also give a platform to Aileen McGillivray,
who learned yesterday that she had reclaimed a share of the national 60m
record with Neef.
As Sandra Douglas won in 7.28, fastest UK time of the year,
McGillivray clocked 7.36. Paula Thomas has already run 7.29, so the Scot
has been promised a guest lane in the French match.
''The Kelvin Hall is faster than Birmingham, so I'm looking forward to
it,'' said McGillivray. It was a first senior indoor medal for the woman
who was AAA under-17 and under-20 champion. Neef's Scottish record,
originally credited at 7.35, has been amended to 7.36 upon further
scrutiny of the photo.
After Grant Graham's victory in the 1500m, which he has been told will
earn him a debut senior vest, Geoff Parsons was the only other Scottish
winner. Commonwealth bronze medallist Parsons reached 2.24m to win a
high jump contest in which only one other competitor cleared the opening
height.
Martin Steele took the 800m, equalling the record three wins by the
absent Tom McKean. Strathclyde geography student Ewan Calvert held off
Edinburgh's Paul Walker for bronze with a lifetime best of 1-50.15.
Aberdeen-born John McKenzie was just short of his native record
distance in the triple jump, second with 16.07m, while Troon's Brian
Whittle finished runner-up for an AAA 400m title for the sixth time in
his life.
Whittle (47.26) was eclipsed in dramatic fashion by 18-year-old Mark
Hylton, who set a UK junior record of 46.56. ''It doesn't take an
Einstein to realise Mark is going to very good indeed,'' said Whittle.
Solomon Wariso is likely to be included in Saturday's team after his
200m win over Darren Braithwaite, making him the first athlete to be
selected by Britain after serving a doping suspension.
Mike Rosswess retained the 60m title with 6.63, as Jamie Henderson
(6.83) lost out on a final place as a fastest loser, and his Edinburgh
Southern clubmate, hurdler Ken Campbell, looked set to qualify
comfortably until he crashed at the final flight.
Kate Staples, who will be named today for the first international
women's pole vault at the Kelvin Hall, cleared 3.80m, her third UK and
Commonwealth record in as many weeks. Winners and Scottish placings:

JOHN Regis shaved .07 from his British indoor 200m record in Stuttgart
yesterday, with a time of 20.47sec, moving to fourth on the world
all-time list and establishing himself as favourite for the World title
in Barcelona next month.
Colin Jackson maintained his unbeaten hurdles record which stretches
back to August 1993 -- but only just. The Welshman was bracketed on
7.44, the same time as American Allen Johnson and Tony Jarrett, who was
third. Jackson was beaten into third in a flat 60m, clocking 6.62 behind
Bruny Surin and Olapade Adeniken (both 6.61).
Linford Christie had a close shave in Japan. He got the verdict over
Davidson Ezinwa with both timed at 6.60.

IT took till the last end of the last qualifying game for Hammy
McMillan's Stranraer team to clinch the last place in the finals of next
month's Macallan Scottish Curling Championships, writes Mike Haggerty.
McMillan's team beat Robbie Dick, of Lockerbie, by 8-5 in the last
sudden-death game of this weekend's repechage tournament at Perth, after
having gone down by 8-4 to Struan McNee, of Edinburgh, who grabbed the
other available qualifying place, yesterday afternoon.

LEE McConnell, from City of Glasgow, was the exceptional performer
over two record-breaking days at the Scottish age-group athletics
championships in Glasgow, writes Doug Gillon.
McConnell, competing in the women's under-17 division at the TSB
meeting on Saturday, equalled the national age record in the high jump,
with 1.73 metres -- which surpassed the winning height in the under-20
group -- and thrice lowered the championship best in the 200 metres.
Edinburgh's Sinead Dudgeon set championship bests of 7.67 and
24.53secs in the heats of the under-20's 60m and 200m, before taking the
titles in slower times.
Hugh Kerr, of Ayr Seaforth, logged the outstanding male performance,
winning the 400m in 48.70, the fastest electronic clocking ever by a
Scot of his age, although a hand-held 48.6 has stood to Iain Cuthbertson
since 1980.
Of the 42 titles available in the older age groups, a third went out
of the country. But there were 13 championship bests in the under-15 and
under-13 events yesterday, all by Scots. Title winners:

THE daily return journey from Funchal to the Madeira Golf Club allowed
plenty of time for reflection on the comment last year by Ken Schofield
that, compared with the generally unexceptional locations of events on
the US Tour, some of those on the European equivalent very definitely
defied convention.
The European Tour's executive director remarked: ''We can be up a
mountain one week, on an island the next.'' And since Madeira's original
course qualifies in both categories, it must have been just such an
awkward place that Schofield had in mind.
It does not do to let concentration waver for a second on a road that
not only constantly rises and falls, as well as seeming to consist of an
endless series of Devil's Elbows, but also is populated by drivers with
a serious tendency towards suicide. Some other thoughts did manage to
penetrate.
These early-season tournaments are how the other half lives -- the
bus, not the courtesy car or the helicopter; the frequently remote site
and cramped infrastructure; and the modest financial returns, a mine of
disappearance money since very few from the upper reaches of the world
or European rankings will ever compete in them.
What could be said for this latest event -- and the others like it --
was that, some 300 miles west of Africa, it was at least within an hour
or two of the Continent which lends the Tour its name and that it gave
the grass-roots members of the profession the chance to compete.
When players such as Faldo and Ballesteros, among others, complain
about the calibre of these courses and their unsatisfactory condition,
and the modesty of the prize funds and the relative weakness of the
fields -- not to mention the sponsors' sheer inability to pay whatever
the going rate of inducement might be -- it suggests only one thing.
Inevitably, as success has changed attitudes and ambitions, the
foremost players become increasingly detached from the rank and file --
of which, of course, they were once only too glad to be members
themselves and from whom their achievements just as surely now distance
them. It was ever thus.
Nevertheless, these are the tournaments that put players' feet on the
first rungs of the career ladder. Not all reach even halfway, but at
least they have been given the chance to try, and the Tour's constant
dilemma is to strike a correct balance.
Someone once described professional golf's in-house split mentality as
a capitalist game invoking the basic principle of every man for himself,
but organised on the philosophy of socialism, providing the greatest
good for the greatest number. The crack is there and it shows.
After all, would not those who are now at the top and are being so
handsomely rewarded -- some would prefer the word absurdly -- have
played in every tournament they could while serving their own
apprenticeships? Little doubt of the answer, in the view from here.
And as the European Tour's powers-that-be never tire of pointing
out, not so many years have elapsed since there were no tournaments on
this side of the Atlantic until after the US Masters in April. This
season 11 events will have been completed before the season's first
major.
No player either needs or wants or can compete in all 36 tournaments
that comprise the 1995 programme for the Order of Merit. Part of a
player's success lies in his judgment of how best to pace himself, and
that applies equally to the other ranks as to the officers.

Douglas Crawford on an island that isn't quite British
FEW would dispute the fact that Ellan Vannin, the Isle of Man, is very
much of a world apart. The often used paradox is that it is a
geographical part of the British Isles and yet it is not British. It has
its own government, laws, stamps, currency (although UK banknotes are
acceptable), its own traditions, and, of course, its Manx cat and Manx
kippers.
The moment you disembark from your aircraft or ferry, you feel that
you are in a different country, almost in a different and in a bygone
era.
The indubitable fact is that the pace of everything here is slower and
much more relaxed than it is on the mainland of the British Isles. On
the eight-mile drive from the airport past farms and villages and
hillsides to Douglas, you get the feeling that you are, getting away
from it all.
An entirely different culture is at work. If you are driving from the
airport you will cross the Fairy Bridge some two miles south of Douglas
and, if you do not wish a Laa Mie, a ''good day'' to the fairies, then
it is said that you cannot be assured a safe and pleasant visit.
Douglas is different from the other towns on the island. It is, as
befits a capital, a bustling resort with no shortage of accommodation or
pubs or restaurants. Much of the island's population lives here and in
neighbouring Onchan, two miles distant at the far end of the two-mile
sweep of Douglas Bay.
By contrast the former capital, Castletown, is a small and quiet
village overlooked by a well preserved tenth-century castle. This
building serves as a reminder that it was not the Romans or the Normans
who shaped the island's history but the Celts and the Vikings.
Another example of this is Peel Castle in the west which was in the
eleventh century the ruling seat of the Norse Kingdom of Mann. (Peel
today is the home of the Manx kipper and herring.) Take a look at the
limestone fortress of Castle Rushen, one of the British Isles' most
complete medieval castles with Viking origins.
Nearby in the village of St John's is Tynwald Hill, site of the
original parliament. Although the modern parliament is based in Douglas,
it is here in St John's that, every first week in July, the world's
oldest continuous parliament maintains a centuries-old tradition.
In the south of the island are the picturesque seaside and sleepy
villages of Port St Mary and Port Erin (from the latter of which there
runs in the summer a regular boat service to the sanctuary of the Calf
of Man, an islet which is owned and managed by Manx National Heritage).
The island's second town is Ramsey, 12 miles north of Douglas and a
place which was once famous for its shipbuilding. En route to there you
pass the 72ft diameter Great Laxey Wheel, the Lady Isabella, which is
the largest working waterwheel in the world.
The Isle of Man is a place where everything is done more slowly than
it is on the mainland. The pace of life here could hardly be more
leisurely -- or, as the Manx put it, ''Traa dy-liooar'', a phrase which
means ''time enough''.
Unique in this context are the Victorian horse-drawn trams which still
service Douglas Promenade. There are of course also the electric
railway, the steam railway, and electric train which goes all the way to
the 2000ft summit of Snaefell (which is Norse for Snow Mountain) in the
centre of the island.
The Snaefell Mountain Railway this year celebrates the centenary of
its operations and is the only electric mountain railway in the British
Isles. From the top of Snaefell you can on a clear day get panoramic
views to the mountains of the Lake District and the Mountains of Mourne.
Around the whole of the island is a 90-mile coastal footpath, known as
Raad ny Foillan (the Road of the Gull). Cliffs above this route rise up
to 1000ft while along the north-west coast are 18 miles of remote
beaches, warmed by the waters of the Gulf Stream and the haunt of grey
seals and little terns.
There is, of course, no better way in which to explore the Isle of Man
than on foot. There is in the island's mountainous landscape vast areas
of unspoilt countryside and it is possible to travel for miles upon
miles of wild open moorland and glens and still not pass a single
homestead.
Flying time from Glasgow to the island is 35 minutes. The journey by
boat from Ardrossan takes about six hours.
The island's department of tourism operates a strict classification
and grading scheme for accommodation -- the only compulsory scheme of
its kind in the British Isles. This applies to all types of
accommodation, hotels to bed and breakfast, self-catering rooms to camp
sites.
Failt erriu gys Mannin aalin yn chennaghys -- welcome to the beautiful
historic Isle of Man.

DON'T be deceived by Hamburg and its image as a dullish industrial
seaport. I found it far from that. The German city is spacious and
green, and criss-crossed by attractive waterways.
Not the most beautiful in Europe, but still worth a visit, either by
ferry from Britain or if you're touring by car or rail.
The red light district, the Reeperbahn, deserves its reputation.
Maiden aunts should still steer clear of this sleazy neon-lit street,
much gazed upon by curious sightseers. The sector is rated by Hamburgers
themselves as ''just an outrageous giggle''. The city's twin Alster
lakes are good for a stroll.
Water means much in Hamburg, and not just because of its large
international harbour. Right in the middle of the city is a fair-sized
lake, the Alster, where you sail on pleasure boats.
The North Sea and Baltic coasts, plus a sprinkling of inland lakes,
are favoured by Europe's water sports-lovers.
The shopping malls are full of quality goods, many with price-tags
similar to our own, but most of them slightly higher.
Hamburg has more bridges than Venice and, incredibly, more jazz clubs
than New Orleans. You can even enjoy jazz with your breakfast. Its
bridges has given it the title Venice of the North, bestowed so freely
on more than one north-European city.
I found the historic sectors of this city full of character. Not
surprising when you remember you are in a seaport with a vintage tag of
800 years. Old buildings have survived wartime bombing, and, harking
back to earlier centuries, yarns of pirates are still told in sailors'
bars where beer is good and cheap.
Hamburg's tourist chiefs, quick to boost the night-life, like to call
their city ''a night-owl's paradise''. No wonder . . . the clubs and
discos stay open almost round the clock.
But there is much to see by day -- the Hamburg State Opera, the
Panoptikum waxworks, a motor-car museum and festivals galore.
Go to the Altona fish market early on a Sunday morning. As well as
fresh fish, you can buy porcelain and exotic plants.
Hagensbeck is a private park where some 2000 animals wander round the
grounds, providing good photo opportunities. Another place to visit,
near to Alster Lakek, is the colourful Islamic Mosque, covered with
thousands of turquoise mosaic tiles.
The approach by sea to Hamburg is a reminder of what ships have meant
to this part of Germany over the centuries.
It's water, water everywhere. The larger of the two city lakes, the
Aussen-Alster, is the biggest lake you will find in the heart of any
city in Europe. The Hamburgers love to go out in their sailing boats,
and to jog or stroll, family-wise, along the Alster's grassy banks.
The city's two lakes are the small Binnen-Alster and the larger
Aussen-Alster. The spires and domes of Hamburg look quite pretty when
you gaze back from a lakeside vantage point.
Wartime bombing has destroyed more than half of the city's houses, and
there has been no beautician's touch in the post-war re-building
programme.
In the city's historical museum you find one of the most interesting
records of the past -- complete archives for the period from 1850 to
1914 of each and every passenger who emigrated from Germany and Eastern
Europe to the promising new world of North America.
What Hamburg lacks in beauty it makes up for in its buzzing
night-life, among the best you will find in Germany.
There are dozens of venues for live music. Big-name bands play
regularly, and there is no lack of beer-and-music joints, discos and
jazz clubs. Similarly, theatre, opera and ballet enthusiasts are offered
a constantly changing scene.
For overall vistas of the city head for the television tower on the
Lagerstrasse, open all day and in the evening until 10. This is now the
highest building in Hamburg.
Getting there: German National Tourist Office (0171 495 3990), 65
Curzon Street, London W1Y 7PE, for useful, detailed guidelines to
Hamburg and surrounding places. You can sail with car and family from
North Shields by Scandinavian Seaways, saving a day by travelling --
with a satisfying degree of comfort -- on the overnight service.

PETER Jacobsen, 40, who mainly spends his time commentating on golf on
television these days, won the A T and T National Pro-Am title at Pebble
Beach, California, yesterday by two shots with a last-round 65, while
Nick Faldo scored a disappointing 72.
The 37-year-old Briton started of the day four strokes off the lead.
But at the third he fluffed a short chip, then got nowhere near the hole
with a seven-foot putt.
Things went from bad to worse for Faldo, but he stuck determinedly to
his task and finished with a birdie 15-footer to finish joint eighth.
Faldo's playing partner, Huey Lewis, a 15-handicap player, improved
the side's score by 20 strokes. Final scores:
271 -- P Jacobsen 67, 73, 66, 65 ($252,000).
273 -- D Duval 72, 67, 67, 69 ($151,200).
Other scores included: 275 -- D Love 65, 71, 71, 68, K Perry 68, 68,
67, 72. 277 -- P Stewart 71, 67, 69, 70. 278 -- J Nicklaus 71, 70, 67,
70
279 -- N Faldo (GB) 66, 72, 69, 72.
ROBERT Allenby carded a level-par 72 yesterday to beat
fellow-Australian Wayne Smith by one shot in the Heineken Classic in
Perth, Australia.
SCOTT Dunlap sank a three-foot birdie putt to beat Zimbabwe's Mark
McNulty on the first hole of a sudden-death play-off in the South
African Masters in Sun City.
J C SNEAD beat Ray Floyd at the first play-off hole to land the Royal
Caribbean Seniors Classic at Key Biscayne, Florida, yesterday with an
aggregate of 209.

OUTBREAKS of disease because of Salmonella will have been familiar to
many farmers over the years.
Although all species of mammals and birds, and all age groups, can be
affected, it is usually a problem of calves causing diarrhoea, sometimes
containing blood, high temperatures and, all too often death of some of
the sick animals.
Commonly there is a history of recently purchased calves, because much
of the problem is because of calves picking up infection from others in
markets or in contractors' vehicles.
Salmonella is infectious to human beings, and most stock men know that
when they have salmonellosis in their animals, they must be very careful
about hygiene to protect themselves and their families.
In 1984, a new type of Salmonella was isolated from human beings in
the UK, known by the codename of DT104. In late 1990 it was isolated
from cattle in Scotland and rapidly became the most commonly isolated
kind of salmonella in cattle throughout the UK.
The behaviour of DT104 seems to be very different from other kinds. It
appears to infect adult cattle on a farm before calves become affected.
usually symptoms of diarrhoea and high temperature occur shortly after
calving, and the organism is resistant to many of the antibiotics
commonly used for the treatment salmonellosis.
Although only a small number of animals on a farm may become ill,
swabbing of larger numbers of cattle on affected farms by SOAFD and SAC
staff has shown that infection is often widespread within the herd among
animals showing no symptoms. It is at least as common in closed herds as
it is in those who buy in replacements and, over the UK as a whole, it
is most common in closed suckler herds.
Nobody knows exactly how it gets into a previously uninfected herd.
The organism is isolated occasionally from normal healthy sheep, pigs
and poultry. It is possible that it could also be present in normal wild
animals and birds and that they carry it from farm to farm. It may also
be carried on vehicles of farmers, suppliers, contractors and veterinary
surgeons moving between farms.
It is important to remember that although some human cases have been
due to a variety of food items, including sausages, meat paste,
unpasteurised milk and contaminated pasteurised milk, much human
infection is the direct result of contact with infected animals.
Episodes of scouring in cattle should always be taken seriously,
especially if adults are affected as well as calves, and especially if
affected animals have a high temperature.
Such outbreaks should always be investigated by a veterinary surgeon
to confirm the cause. People handling the stock or coming in contact
with their dung must wash and disinfect their clothing and footwear
frequently and regularly. Finally, if stock men or their families become
ill with diarrhoea, consult a doctor immediately and tell him that there
has been contact with confirmed or suspected cases of DT104.

IT can be an uphill struggle running a Scottish ski area. The vagaries
of Highland weather make it a risky business at the best of times and
finding ways of attracting the maximum number of skiers on the
relatively few good days in a normal season is obviously the main
priority.
The ski areas have responded to the challenge in different ways. One
is building its own golf course and another is, believe it or not,
teaching its staff to smile and be polite.
Cairngorm, not satisfied with its multi-million pound plan for a
funicular railway, new buildings, and lift system has embarked on the
even more ambitious scheme of having laughing lifties. Well, perhaps not
laughing but at least pretty cheerful.
All staff, from catering to management, attended a customer-care
lecture in December and more are planned for this year. Set up with the
help of the Local Enterprise company, the event received a positive
reaction from everyone. To be honest, I am not the only person to have
noticed a much friendlier reception on the hill this season.
The chairlift company is also optimistic about the funicular scheme.
While the planning application is being considered by a special council
sub-committee, it has had responses from the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds and Scottish National Heritage which had objected to
the increased number of summer visitors to the Cairngorm plateau the new
development would bring. The size of the planned Ptarmigan visitor
centre has been reduced and the company is confident other problems can
be overcome.
The ever-increasing number of boarders at Cairngorm, which has 17
lifts, 23 runs, and 200 instructors on the slopes at the busiest times,
are catered for by the Fiaciall snowboard park. As the snow depth
increases, jumps and possibly a half-pipe will be built but at the
moment staff are letting the snow drift into natural formations ideal
for boarding bliss.
Glenshee had a late start to the season with its first decent weekend
at the end of January, is diversifying in an unusual manner. It is
constructing its own golf course.
The chairlift company has bought a farm at Alyth, received detailed
planning permission for the scheme, and begun earth-moving operations.
It should be complete this summer and will employ ski area staff,
including lifties. Presumably, they will stand beside the tees and look
bored as they pass your golf bag before you set off down the fairway.
Meanwhile, the area, which has 38 pistes, 24 lifts, and 40km of
downhill, has some attractive package deals. Five day's instruction, ski
hire, and lift pass will cost you #105. Not bad when one day's lift pass
is #15. A beginner's package of the same items for five days (Monday to
Friday) comes in at #75.
Scotland's newest ski area at Nevis Range on Aonach Mor, seven miles
north of Fort William, is getting bigger but, unfortunately, not until
next season. Agreement has been reached with the landowner, British
Alcan, to put in a chairlift and tow for new green runs at the bottom of
the Nid Wall. It is hoped to do the work this summer and have the runs
operational next season. A chairlift ''over the back'' in Corrie Dubh
will be constructed the following summer, giving access to excellent
intermediate and advanced skiing.
The condition for the development is that Nevis Range build a gravel
filter for one of Alcan's hydro scheme air intakes. The ski area, which
is rumoured to have the lowest base station in Europe at 300ft above sea
level, has nine lifts, 23 runs, and a creche.
By the way, if you have ever wondered why the area is called Nevis
Range instead of just Aonach Mor, one reason was to avoid confusion with
the somewhat similar sounding Aviemore.
Another area not resting on its laurels is the White Corries in
Glencoe. Higher pylons have been put in the top tow to allow it to
operate in much deeper snow after it was buried for two months by last
season's massive dump.
The area, which has six lifts and 13 official runs plus five or six
unofficial routes, is shut on Tuesday and Wednesday but may consider
opening mid-week this season if the conditions merit it.
There has been a good response to the 100-seater restaurant which
opened last summer. Although dedicated skiers tend to stay up the hill
all day grabbing lunch in the snack bar, an increasing number are having
an evening meal in the licensed restaurant before they head home. It
normally stops serving at 6pm but may stay open if there is a demand.
Glencoe, which likes to pride itself on a friendly atmosphere, limits
its season tickets to 250 although it could easily sell more and the
policy of closing the doors when the car park is full means there are
never more than 1000 to 1200 skiers on the slopes.
Over in Strathdon, the main problem facing The Lecht ski area is the
notorious Tomintoul to Cockbridge road beside which it stands. Liable to
be blocked at the drop of a snowflake, it has to be cleared most
mornings before the area can open. To help the region roads department
perform this difficult task, the chairlift company has bought a second
snow-blower. It seems to have paid off because the road has been cleared
every day before 11am. Another improvement is a computerised ticket
system which makes things easier for both the customer and management.
The ski area, which has 12 lifts and 20 runs, is very clear about its
market -- beginners and intermediates. It claims to have the best
beginners' area in Scotland because the runs are only 10 yards from the
car park, the small tows are easy for children to handle, and parents
can sit in the car park and watch the youngsters on the tows and the
runs. The management has the honesty to admit that, once skiers had
become proficient, they tend to move on to other areas.

THEATRICALITY has been the syntax of Peter Shaffer's work since John
Dexter put it on the stage of the National 30 years ago.
Richard Baron, currently one of the most consistently successful young
directors working in Scotland, has discovered that language for himself
in a production that makes exemplary use of the Rep's space (Tristan
Tovey's set includes a specially designed proscenium arch, uses the full
depth of the stage and flies in scenery and props -- and characters
spill out into the auditorium) alongside shadowplay, masks, and mime.
Performances throughout the company match this -- from Susan Nisbet's
playful accent-switching as Constanze to Kern Falconer's posturing
Emperor Joseph.
Jimmy Chisholm (Mozart) -- sporting a succession of outrageous wigs to
match his loud costumes -- is still in panto mode for most of the piece,
portraying the composer as a camp flibertigibbet, which quite suits the
tone. Only Michael Mackenzie's Salieri -- whose story it really is --
calls for a deeper characterisation, and he makes a convincing
disintinction between the tongue-lolling repentant old man of 1832 and
the ambitious vengeful court composer of 1781.
This production caught a first-night audience that was initially a
little unsure and reeled them in -- to the extent that a spontaneous
round of applause welled up after the scene of Figaro's rehearsal. Yet
for all that there is a difficulty in Baron's approach and Chisholm's
performance.
While the anti-Faustian pact of the title is admirably handled, the
big moments at the end of Act One (when Salieri appreciates Mozart's
genius), at Act Two (when, masked, he tries to precipitate his death)
fail to have the impact they should. Shaffer doesn't make that easy, but
this production exaggerates the problems.

WE HAD a party on Monday night to say goodbye to the latest from this
hill to seek a new life in what used to be called the Empire. The fact
that the emigre was a grand-daughter, was called after him and was only
seven years old, gave the farmer a meaning to the words, ''parting is
such sweet sorrow.''
Charlie Jean has been spending school terms with her father, the
Recovery Stock, in his new family at Fraserburgh and her holidays in
Edinburgh with her mother. She likes the farm of her ancestors and
indeed is the only one of her generation to show any interest in
livestock. She likes to feed the cattle with handfuls of cake from the
bag, and there is no anthropomorphic nonsense about her. You may
remember that when I showed her the little piggies gamboling in the
straw she asked eagerly: ''Can you eat them?'' I think if we had her for
longer we could steer that young lady away from the hazards of
vegetarianism alright.
Of course, we are used to sending our best abroad to civilise the
world. I have told you of my great-grandmother in 1909 watching the last
of her three sons setting off for the Empire. She was never to see any
of them again and is said to have complained only once. Then she told of
her longing to hear from Jimmy before she died. He had never even
managed a letter.
My grandfather's siblings stayed in Scotland but my mother had a
cousin Sandy, who planted tea in Ceylon and cousin John, who went to
Canada and became the boss of Long John (from which he got the
inevitable nickname Whisky Johnny) before climbing to the very top of
the American booze free as Chairman of Schenleys.
That was my mother's side. In a pattern which was once familiar in
these parts, my father's father went to California when the baby was
announced and his mother left soon after he was born. That way I got
seven aunts in California and an aunt and two uncles in Canada. And two
of my father's uncles followed their little sister to the Americas.
So little Charlie Jean was standing in a proud, if sad tradition, when
she embraced her family on Monday.
There was her uncle, the Wasting Asset who realises that the thing he
is wasting most is the chance to produce people like her. There were her
aunts; the Investments. Her two cousins were there and the half sister
who she loves dearly but is as yet too young to do much loving back. She
may meet that sister some day as a stranger when they are grown up. She
comforted the grand-mother who is unlikely to see much of (at least for
many years) with, ''But I'll come back for your funeral, Granny.''
''Damn the funeral,'' said the Breadwinner. ''I won't see you at all
if you don't come before I'm dead.''
It was the Recovery Stock who said we would need to have a speech. It
seemed like a funny thing to have a toast to one so young, but the
Wasting Asset and I agreed that it might help to give her a sense of
occasion and give her another thing to remember the other half of her
family by.
It was agreed that a doting uncle would be best so the Wasting Asset
was chosen. After a few minutes to think about it, he decided that he
wouldn't manage. He is first rate when it comes to riot control at a
rave but so heart-searching a job as a farewell toast to seven-year-old
niece was too much.
So The Farmer got the job.
I'd have liked to tell her about the generations who have gone forth
from here to all parts of the world. And how, though they were
scattered, there were always enough of us left on this hill for it to
remain a home for them all. I'd have liked to tell her about her
great-great-great uncle Dod and how each year he wrote maybe next year.
And how, in the our of this country's greatest need, Uncle Dod, who
never made it himself, sent a son to fight in the Battle of Britain and
how that young pilot took me sledgeing.
I'd have liked to tell her that every few years another young
back-packer appears in the village looking for Little Ardo. She is
looking for her roots. And I should have told her that we would always
try to be here for all those young people whose families had taken the
step that she was about to take.
But all I managed was to say how lucky we were to have so many
children and so many grandchildren to have a nice party with. And how we
should not be selfish. With so many, we could spare another one for the
new world. I told her that we wished her well and that we looked forward
to the day when she would come back to see us. Granny, far from being
dead, would dance at her wedding.
Then, to our astonishment, the seven-year-old, with no mother there to
prompt her, and being the only emigrant there, climbed onto her chair
and made a wonderful speech in reply. Wearing the tartan dress which
might have fitted six months ago, and looking so beautiful with her
clear skin, blond hair and sparkling blue eyes, she told her family
assembled at the table; ''Thank you for coming to my party. I am very
excited cos I'm going to Australia. But I'll be sad as well because I'll
miss all of youse''
And she didn't cry until later ...
But the Wasting Asset did.

IT WAS Dr Peter Sutherland, the director of the World Trade
Organisation, who last month recalled a briefing on the most recent GATT
negotiations when he was forced to concede ''if you're not confused,
then you haven't been paying attention.''
He told the story to an audience of 500 at the Oxford Farming
Conference. The same sentiments might have applied this week to the
audience at a meeting in Inverurie where it was standing room only as
about 350 members of the local agricultural community crowded into the
ballroom of Thainstone House Hotel.
The topic was Food and Farming -- A Future?. By the end of the evening
my answer was '' yes there is a future -- but God alone knows what it
will be.''
The problem was not a lack of experts but rather the diversity of
views expounded. Food for thought was certainly in abundant supply.
Professor Philip James, director of the Rowett Research Institute,
came along expecting to be the villain of the piece but found that
fellow speaker Sean Rickard, a former chief economist with the NFU in
England and Wales was the one being dubbed a gloom merchat.
In a week when farm incomes were reported to have gone up by 31% the
audience probably did not want to hear talk of an increasing resistance
by politicians to the idea that large sums of money should continue be
handed over to farmers. He foresaw a future in which our food supplies
would increasingly be drawn from wherever they could be produced most
cheaply and efficiently.
One future scenario, he suggested, could be the creation of a less
intensive ''greener'' farming industry in Britain, meeting consumer
desires in that direction. That scene runs contrary to the school of
thought which goes for economies of scale and ever-increasing efficiency
with higher outputs and lower numbers employed.
However, says Sean, ''if the public are going to hand over larger sums
of money to the farmers , you will be faced with demands to farm in ways
that society finds acceptable.'' That could mean greater controls and
regulations and, at the end of the day, increased costs.
Having gone into a variety of policy options for a future CAP he drew
a warm response from his audience with a call for a clear statement from
the British government on what they thought agriculture was about today.
''Is it only a provider of cheap commodities -- or does it provide a
service, including the countryside?'' he asked. ''If you believe that
the environment is of such importance that it could rank alongside food,
then there are arguments for thinking about an altogether different
policy that brings about a less intensive agriculture.''
So far, so good. There are problems, however, and Sean indetified two
major ones. Firstly the less-intensive road appears to run contrary to
what had been agreed in the GATT negotations. Secondly, and nearer home,
less intensive farming means less actual production, less ''product''
coming through for our meat processors and manufacturers -- the one
sector with potential to gain from the GATT arrangements. ''Ultimately
you depend on those food processors and their imagination and marketing
skills to make sure your beef finds buyers in Europe,'' he warned.
''Never under-estimate how important it is that we have a successful and
competitive food processing industry in this country.''
Before the next CAP reform -- by the year 2000 -- there was a
desperate need for farmers and consumers to think through the issues, he
said. Farmers should engage in that debate and arrive at an agreed
policy on what was going to be best for the industry in the longer term.
Professor James, whose views on what constitues a healthy diet are
sometimes represented as being anti-beef, turned out to be the man with
some hope for the future.
His vision for the future included a possible role for Britain's
farmers as major food providers for the ever burgeoning population on
the Pacific rim. Economic growth there would be so fantastic that they
would become large importers of food, he suggested.
While that market might take some years to come on stream there was a
complementary strategy worth considering. ''I am amazed we do not talk
more about land use for non-food crops'', he said.
In addition to the obvious example of oilseed rape there were
possibilities for industrial crops producing cellulose for the plastics
industry or fibres for paper production.
On the animal front the Rowett is already investigating the
possibilities for the domestic production of cashmere and -- a real
money spinner -- vicuna. ''Talk to the old ladies from the Crombie mills
who will tell you they would guard the vicna wool with their lives. It
is almost priceless,''says Professor James.
''These are animals adapted to live at high altitudes and on appalling
terrain. What do we have in Scotland?''
Yes, there is a future. Roll on the SVPS (Special Vicuna Premium
Scheme). As for me, I think I will try to corner the vicuna quota
market.

Performance Art
PART of the Despair programme of the CCA's Bad Times exhibition, this
performance piece conceived and directed by Michael Mayhew and performed
by Beckie Edmunds hones in on the ultimate expression of despair.
Inspired by Mayhew's family history -- various male relatives have
committed suicide -- it intellectualised the act, offering
multiperspectives via various spotlights which ultimately swing and fail
to shed any true light.
With lithe movement and sparse monologues, Edmunds portrays diverse
emotional states; panic, hysterical humour, morose introspection, calm
control. The mindscape evoked is undoubtedly rough terrain -- the piece
clearly postulates that it cannot only be easier but really quite
inevitable to take the plunge. Dedicated to Mayhew's father, it is
subtitled Je Suis deja mort and Edmunds evolves into a self-contained
study of bleakness: I am already dead.
Light and dark are not metaphors for life and death here but for
understanding and despair. Mayhew considers the possibility that suicide
can be equated with comprehension, a walk towards a shaft of light, not
a dark tunnel.
Yet the piece does not fetishise suicide. Edmunds spirals around this
space in a disturbing panic-felt quest. She occasionally ventures
towards a metal-backed mike, which distorts her tones to steely tinged
authoritarian echoes, to emphasise how messy the business can be. She
giggling apologises for her opening gestures, exaggerated mimes of slit
wrists and hanged heads, but her soft ''sorry'' becomes an urgent
invocation, the hopeless motif of the suicide.
It's an interesting examination but ultimately insubstantial and
despite an element of audience participation it is curiously uninvolving
considering the issue has such universal poignancy.

DESPITE tumbling prices for gilts last year, the market continued to
function well and there was a net increase of two in the number of gilt
market-makers.
The 22 market-makers at the end of the year had added #137m to their
capital base, taking it to #811m and more than outweighing the losses
that most sustained. The top seven firms had 70% of the market.
According to an article in the forthcoming issue of the Bank of
England Quarterly Bulletin, the market-makers in aggregate returned to
profit in the fourth quarter. Most of the earlier losses occurred in the
first quarter.
The bank points out that real yields rose in the first half of the
year but stabilised thereafter. Slight falls in the proportions of gilts
held by insurance companies, pension funds, individuals and foreign
investors were offset by increases by fund managers and other
institutions.
Average daily turnover by value at #6100m was slightly down on 1993
and peaked at #8600m in February.
In contrast to certain overseas bond markets, which suspended auctions
of stock when markets were turbulent, gilt auctions took place as
planned. The Bank said this was partly because issues could be tailored
to some extent to cater for the extreme conditions.
The 10 auctions held in 1994 were for a total of #22.2bn, 73% of the
total stock issued -- higher than usual because of market conditions.
Despite the latter the average level of cover was higher than in 1993 at
1.69 times.
The largest volume of conventional issues was in the seven to 15-year
range, which accounted for 32% of stock sold. Longs represented 21% and
shorts 19%.
Index-linked stock maturities were between 2001 and 2024. These stocks
now make up 17% of the total portfolio, which amounts to #228bn, up from
#204bn at the end of 1993.
Turnover of LIFFE gilt derivatives continued to grow strongly,
increasing by 64% to 76,000 contracts daily. This peaked at 137,000 in
February when daily transactions in options reached 21,000 contracts.

Perth, Sunday
A BRITISH yachtsman who survived two months adrift on the Indian Ocean
with limited food and water today defended his decision to sail from
Singapore to Mauritius on a voyage that cost his wife's life.
''I can't blame myself,'' Ashok Baljoresai said, when asked if he
considered it reckless to set out on such a long voyage without a
satellite beacon and without notifying anyone in Mauritius of their
likely arrival date.
''I just had very bad luck,'' Baljoresai told a crowded news
conference. ''You could go out on the street tomorrow and be knocked
over.''
The ordeal had not put him off ocean sailing, he added.
The 54-year-old yachtsman described drifting on his crippled yacht in
the middle of the Indian Ocean and being forced to bury his wife at sea.
The Russian cargo ship that rescued the Mauritian-born former
laboratory technician two weeks ago arrived in Fremantle, Western
Australia, yesterday.
He said the trip had turned into a nightmare on November 28 when a
huge storm blew up and his 33ft yacht lost its mast in strong winds and
huge waves. The engine failed and the batteries powering the yacht's
radio died.
His wife of three months, Pamela Thompson, 66, had died on or around
January 12. They had married in Singapore shortly before setting out to
Mauritius.
She had shown signs of illness even before the storm struck, but he
was not sure exactly why she died.
''It was a gradual thing,'' Baljoresai said.
''The intake of food was diminishing until finally she started
vomiting and she couldn't keep down the water. She just became
dehydrated.''
Baljoresai said his wife did not speak about her illness and appeared
to enter a coma before she died in his arms.
The day after she died, Baljoresai cleaned his wife's body, dressed
her in clean clothes, tied a piece of the mast to her body to act as a
weight and said a prayer before lowering her into the sea.
Baljoresai said he might have survived a few weeks longer on his
rations of flour, rice and the cup of water a day he was able to
distill. ''I probably could have lasted another month maximum.''
Baljoresai lived in London from 1967 to 1988 and met his wife when
they were working at a hospital in London.
The pair became sailing companions in 1988 and had been living in the
small Mauritian village of Baie-du-Cap before flying to Singapore to buy
the #35,000 yacht.
The news conference saw heated scenes between Australian and UK media
representatives as a British reporter, who said his paper had paid
Baljoresai for exclusive aspects of the story, attempted to wind up the
briefing.
Baljoresai said he still hoped his uninsured yacht might eventually
wash up on the coast of Australia or New Zealand.
Australian police and a coroner had interviewed him on arrival in
Fremantle and were satisfied with his explanation of his wife's death,
he said.
He planned to return to Mauritius as soon as possible.--Reuter.

THE stock market will be looking for news this week on the future of
Costain, with Bovis emerging as the most likely bidder for the ailing
construction group, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Costain announced a bid approach last week and P&amp;O's Bovis is the
obvious purchaser, though it is unlikely to pay much more than the
current 23[1/2]p the shares stand at, having risen by just 7% on the bid
news.
Bovis already has commercial links with Costain. The two are joint
bidders for contracts in South-east Asia and for private sector
infrastructure projects in the UK, including roads.
Costain has a good reputation in construction circles but has been
badly hit by strong competition and constant pressure in margins and
hampered by debt. It needs to be part of a larger company. Bovis lacks
civil engineering skills so Costain would be a good fit.
But its remaining US coal interests would have to be sold. It has
recently agreed the sale of its most profitable mining business for #63m
and the rest will probably have to be sold at a loss. Talks about a sale
are under way.
Possible bid outsiders are Continental groups like Bouygues of France
and Holzmann of Germany which might see Costain as a toehold in the UK
market they could develop.

BUSINESSES from elsewhere in the UK and overseas will be more likely
to buy Scottish if the country's major corporates make maximum use of
financial services in their own backyard, a Glasgow conference will
stress today, writes BILL MAGEE.
Why Buy Scottish is the title of the event organised by Scottish
Financial Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise, and Industry Minister
Allan Stewart will call for links between buyers and suppliers to be
strengthened.
SFE and SE together with KPMG Peat Marwick reported recently that 69%
of financial and business services currently bought by corporates were
provided by Scottish suppliers.
Grant Baird, SFE's executive director, said this served to illustrate
both the strengths of the suppliers in Scotland together with the
substantial market share remaining for which they can compete.
However, suppliers in this country may be losing out to English
counterparts because, although the former has the talent, they may lack
either the confidence or experience at the highest level to compete.
The conference, at the Moat House International and chaired by Sir
Iain Noble, chairman of the Noble Group and well-known advocate of
Scottish interests, will gives both buyers and suppliers a platform to
air their views.

THE chances of the leak inquiries launched by the British and Irish
Governments actually identifying the leaker are pretty slim. This does
not mean that the exercise is worthless to them. The inquiries purport
to demonstrate that no Minister in either Government is guilty.
Since the bedrock of the peace process is its joint UK/Irish nature,
it is vital that no attempt to divide London and Dublin succeeds. The
longer the official ceasefire (IRA from last September 1, loyalists from
October 14) holds the greater the pressure on the politicians not to
throw it away.
The leak suggests that Mr Major is a liar and that he is moving
towards agreeing all-Ireland institutions. Not so long ago such an
incident would have provoked enormous demonstrations and melodramatic
actions from the Unionists. Remember the destruction of Edward Heath's
Sunningdale Agreement in 1973?
Perhaps Mr Major's speedy and public denial of skulduggery prevented a
similar fate befalling Northern Ireland now. His action achieved at
least four things:
It reminded everyone, in Ireland and mainland Britain, that the
ceasefire is not to be taken for granted. It brought about a restatement
by Mr Blair and Mr Ashdown of their backing for the way Mr Major is
seeking a lasting solution. It prepared all concerned for the imminent
next stage to come from the two Governments in about a month. And it was
the vehicle for a pre-emptive strike to prevent the Tory Party becoming
hysterical.
You might say that the leak itself to The Times achieved all of this,
but in order to be sure of that you need to know the leaker and his
motive. For all I know it could have been a politician, civil servant,
or office cleaner who just felt disposed to give a journalist pal a good
story after Irish Premier John Bruton had applied immediacy to the
resolution of negotiations. These, he said, were better than 95%
complete.
I have heard various theories about the nature of the leak and the
leaker: that Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, was
irritated by Mr Bruton's complacent remark and let a cat out of the bag
that he was sure would make a very big noise.
That Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister who is
negotiating with Sir Patrick, felt likewise and wanted to teach the new
coalition Premier a lesson. Or try this one: Viscount Cranborne,
Government Leader in the Lords and a famous friend of the Unionists, was
so enraged by the way negotiations were going that he alerted the
Friends of the Union, who have contacts with The Times journalist
involved.
Or again that Mr Jim Molyneaux -- having spotted a power struggle
among Ulster Unionist MPs to replace him -- leaked the discussion paper
to create a furore that would enable him to act tough when, up to now,
he has acted quiescent. I have even heard it suggested that Mr John
Hume, the SDLP leader who helped to persuade the IRA into an indefinite
ceasefire, was the one responsible. What his motive might have been
escapes me and, I think, my informant.
All is rumour. What is definite is that Lord Cranbourne, asked by a
Tory MP at a late-night gathering of about 60 in the Prime Minister's
room at the Commons to state his position, replied that he had full
confidence in Mr Major and that he would not resign from the Cabinet.
His fellow Ministers in the Lords asked him for the same reassurance the
following day and they got it.
Lord Cranborne, significantly, appears to be unconcerned about the
leaked content of a draft (or discussion) paper. His family, the Cecils,
have a historic interest in Irish politics. As an MP he resigned as
parliamentary private secretary (along with Ian Gow, whose death was
commemorated by the founding of the Friends of the Union) from Margaret
Thatcher's administration when she signed the UK/Irish Agreement in
1985. This gave Dublin a say in Northern Irish affairs.
If Lord Cranborne is content, the Unionists should feel safer in the
Prime Minister's assertion that all-Ireland authorities could only come
about if they were desired by a Belfast assembly, which they would
control. They will not be imposed by London or Dublin. But the Unionists
don't take anything for granted from the British Government. They are
not actually on the march, but they are creating a fuss.
Mr Molyneaux flirts with the Labour Party since Mr Blair gave Marjorie
Mowlem the Northern Ireland spokesmanship. The appointment flagged a
firmer Labour policy of Irish unity by consent only. She was duly
accorded the accolade of being allowed at the weekend to address the
Londonderry East constituency party of Mr Molyneaux's Chief Whip, Mr
Willie Ross.
Yesterday Mr Molyneaux told a meeting of about 200 Unionist
councillors in Armagh City to start choosing candidates for all
constituencies where there is no sitting MP. This is the Unionist leader
telling his people that he, at least, is prepared to weaken the
Government in the Commons in such a way as might bring on an early
election.
When the UK/Irish joint framework document is published and contains
no coercion for all-Ireland institutions on cross-border co-operation,
the Ulster Unionists may claim that their threats have saved the day.
Then they might feel secure enough to enter talks with the SDLP and Sinn
Fein about how to establish a Belfast assembly to run Northern Ireland
affairs again.
The Times leak could turn out to be a blessing in disguise if it has
let off steam at an appropriate time. If the two Governments ever
succeed in tracing the leaker they might be tempted not to punish but to
honour him.

<HEADLINE>Time to reward women with a better deal on pensions</HEADLINE>

THE cornerstone of the Government's proposals for dealing with the
extra costs of state pensions imposed by an ageing population is simply
to raise the retirement age for women to 65.
This can, of course, be justified on grounds of equality and by the
demographic fact that women live longer than men but many women and men
believe it is a retrograde step that people should have to stay working
to a later age when young people have to struggle to find employment.
It would surely be more logical for men to retire earlier, though cost
is clearly a major barrier to this ideal.
However, one would certainly think that in exchange for this
considerable sacrifice on the part of women they would at least be
rewarded with a better deal in respect of their state pension than they
have in the past. In fact, the Government's recent proposals do little
to improve the situation.
Because of career breaks to raise a family and look after elderly
relatives, women are more dependent on the state pension than men. If
they have only a low income, which is also often the case, then they may
miss out altogether. As a result of this there are over one million
women of pensionable age claiming income support, against only 250,000
men.
Raising women's retirement age will be phased in over 20 years,
beginning in the year 2000, and all women now under 40 will not qualify
for state pension before 65. The savings are estimated at #5000m and
rather than disappear into the Treasury, it is only right than it be
used to improve pensions for women.
Scare stories that the state will have no choice but to scale back
pension benefits to make them affordable are wide of the mark. It is
certainly true in some Continental countries where there are genuine
difficulties ahead but, according to research by the Equal Opportunities
Commission (EOC), Britain's demographic outlook is better than most.
We will have the second-highest support ratio -- the number of people
of working age compared with pensioners of our trading competitors by
the middle of the next century. And we already have one of the cheapest
state pension schemes in the world.
The cost could be spread further over the long term through
encouraging more people to work through training and provision of
childcare facilities. The money could and should be found to give women
a better deal. The current scheme remains based on an obsolete social
structure.
As EOC chairwoman Kamlesh Bahl said recently: ''The system was based
on the concept of men working in full-time employment with dependent
wives and does not reflect the reality of people's lives today. The
world of work will be very different in the future and men as well as
women will face options of part-time working, breaks in their employment
and retraining for a new career.''
The new pension proposals will mean that under Serps, the state
earnings-related pension scheme, a woman will end up with a lower
pension in real terms unless she can find work between the ages of 60
and 65. This arises because the average lifetime earnings on which the
pension is calculated would be averaged over the additional five years.
On present form such employment prospects will be poor.
One way round this would be to calculate entitlement on the average of
a certain number of best earning years. Those not having the requisite
minimum number of working years would receive a pension reduced pro
rata.
The EOC inquiry places doubts on the Government's belief that action
has to be taken to reduce the future cost of state pensions. The size of
the working population is likely to contract in the next century but
this may be compensated by lower unemployment levels and a move by the
non-working population into employment. This natural trend could be
encouraged by governments at the time, taking steps to encourage groups
such as married women and older people back into work.
The UK should also gain competitive advantage from the fall in
National Insurance contribution rates which the EOC considers likely. If
correct this would mean that a modest increase could be used to improve
women's pensions.
What is certain is that a large proportion of women will be dependent
on the state pension for decades to come. Its importance will not fade
away as the Government hopes. The pattern of low earnings and career
interruptions makes it less likely that women will belong to
occupational schemes and the low contributions they could afford to make
to personal pension policies would be swallowed up in costs.
Women's contribution to society in the form of childcare and looking
after elderly relatives, from which the state is withdrawing, should be
recognised more than it is in such women requiring a lower contributions
record to secure full basic pension. There are credits available for
home responsibilities as those mentioned but these need to be extended.
These credits may also be available to women who do not earn enough to
make National Insurance contributions.
These provisions and the ability to claim a pension on the husband's
contribution record certainly helps but there remains the basic problem
that the basic pension is simply inadequate to live on and as things
stand can only deteriorate.
A restoration of indexing to average earnings rather than inflation is
the minimum requirement and this should be affordable in a low-inflation
world.

January 27.
It is sad that misunderstandings marred the ceremonies commemorating
the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The juxtaposition
of the martyrdom of Poles and the annihilation of Jews caused much
bitterness. Therefore it is good that Robert McLaughlan (The evil of
ordinary men, January 27) mentions other camps on Polish territory.
While Auschwitz began its existence as a concentration camp for
persons whom the German occupiers had perceived as actually, or
potentially, harmful, nevertheless its main purpose was not the
extermination of a race.
For that the Nazis built Birkenau. It was Birkenau that was conceived
as a death factory, processing Jews from all over Europe, not solely
Polish Jews. But even there there existed a small chance of being
selected for work, hence for possible survival.
No such chance existed in the camps Robert McLaughlan lists. He
enumerates Belzec, Chelmno, Treblinka, Sobibor. This list is by no means
exhaustive. One can add to it Maidanek and many more. These were
intended purely and solely as extermination camps, efficient factories
of death designed to rid Europe of its Jews once and for all.
There was nobody left to be liberated when those places fell into the
hands of the Russian liberators. There is no argument as to who was
martyred there. There were no survivors and there is no commemoration.

I agree with some of what Brian Meek writes (January 30). Turning the
Royal Mile into a vennel is making the city of Edinburgh a laughing
stock.
However, in his determination to be politically incorrect, Brian Meek
has weakened his argument. He will never get sympathy for motorists. it
is the small shops and enterprises which have been decimated and which
do not deserve what has happened to them. Some will just creep away, and
we will all be poorer for it.
As a politician Brian Meek ought also to have revealed that he knows
where the mischief lies. Road ''improvements'' do not re quire planning
permission, and until there is a reform in that matter the dotty schemes
of people with a virtually free hand will continue unchecked.

The recently leaked document on UK aviation security reveals that Mr
Ditmas, who has been working hard to improve Transec since he was
appointed to his post after Lockerbie, is now faced with a 30% cut in
funding.
An across-the-board cut of around 18% for the department has been
ordered by the Secretary of State. The reason that security comes off
even worse is because Transec had expanded to fulfil its post-Lockerbie
obligations, but is now to be funded at 82% of what it was receiving
before that expansion was completed; this would be 30% of current
expenditure.
In an interesting comment in a letter from March, 1993, Mr Ditmas
refers to the Transec annual report and quotes, ''there is still a
considerable way to go before aviation security in the UK can be deemed
to be at an acceptable level''. It is hard to believe that even allowing
for the increases in efficiency which Mr Ditmas has undoubtedly
achieved, and which we should acknowledge, Transec could achieve ''an
acceptable level'' of security in the face of 30% cuts.
The reported comment of Lord Goschen (Minister for Aviation) that we
need not worry because these cuts are of civil servants, not security
personnel, beggars belief. Transec has charge of deciding, ordering, and
checking aviation security procedures for all UK airlines and airports
and indeed for all foreign airlines using our facilities. The aviation
industry is of course profit-driven, and as Lockerbie so cruelly showed
must not be left to police itself.
Others have suggested that ''reduced terrorist threat'' might justify
reduced aviation security. The recent French Airbus hijacking together
with comments of Nato's Secretary General, Willy Claes, only last week
in the Suddentschezeitung newspaper -- ''Fundamentalism is at least as
dangerous as communism was, please do not underestimate the risk'' --
should refute that excuse.
There is of course the House of Commons all-party Select Committee on
Transport, which could call the Secretary of State for Transport to
explain these draconian cuts. But one's enthusiasm for that might be
dampened by the fact that the same Paul Channon who was in charge when
the inadequacies of UK aviation security were so horribly highlighted by
the Lockerbie disaster has now been made chairman of that committee.
The leak of this document has shown a government policy of trying to
save cash without any reference whatsoever to the human lives which
would be put at risk. However non-political one may be one has to ask
what importance does the Government attach to honouring its promises to
the House and to the nation, and does it really set the protection of
the lives of its citizens above cash economies?
This cost-cutting exercise is an insult to the memory of those who
died both on the plane and on the ground at Lockerbie six years ago. It
must be stopped, before we lose another aircraft.

Councillor McCarron (January 27) takes my words out of context. I was
simply posing a question. If Labour becomes a party of the status quo,
and you believe the status quo stinks, why should you then vote Labour?
He also wants to know if ''terms like social justice are not good
enough for Jimmy Reid''. They're meaningless, and therefore can't be
good enough. Anyone can talk of social justice. Mussolini was rather
fond of the phrase.
Labour's historic task is to make social justice a reality for the
poor and the weak, not ambiguous words in a rule book or television
sound bite.
To toss about phrases like ''equality of opportunity'' or ''freedom of
choice'' in abstract terms is also quite bogus. The homeless in London
are as free as Jeffrey Archer to live in a luxury penthouse flat.
Jeffrey Archer can afford to do so, and does. The homeless live in
cardboard boxes because they can't afford to live anywhere else.
Today in this country, as you read this, poor pensioners are free to
die of hypothermia. Given decent pensions they could be free to live.
Given a roof over their heads the homeless could live better and longer.
Caring for the needy, not the greedy, is the essence of socialism. You
care for those in need through policies and aims that are specific, not
with the kind of verbal waffle so beloved by the chattering classes in
London.
Significant redistribution of wealth in favour of the poor requires a
serious challenge to the corporate power of the super rich. But Tony
Blair views them as allies in the making, swears he can manage their
system more efficiently than John Major, which if anything is an
argument for being leader of the Conservative Party. Labour was founded
to end the rackets, not run them.
In fundamentals he is further to the right than Edward Heath. He's as
non-socialist who, not surprisingly, wants to lead a non-socialist
party.
The updating of Clause 4 was never the issue. The aim is to drown all
vestiges of socialist commitment in a sea of amorphous phrases.
Blair will probably be our next Prime Minister. I fear he will tear
Labour apart, as happened in the 1930s when hopes invested in a Labour
Government quickly turned to ashes.

January 27.
As an outsider looking in on the current debate within the Labour
Party over Clause 4, I was greatly encouraged to read Robin Cook's
refocusing of the common ownership objective (January 26), in particular
his call for ''a wider use of company structures in which the workers
own the business''.
I must confess to a vested interest, being a member of an organisation
which promotes and assists the establishment of employee-owned
businesses and worker co-operatives.
The Shadow Foreign Secretary offers sound arguments for retaining
health, education, and transport in the public domain. He also points
out quite correctly that co-operative structures and employee ownership
are ways to remedy market failure and short-termism within British
industry.
The case for the more efficient use of human resources within any
enterprise is increasingly recognised by management theorists. However,
they consistently refuse to address the ownership question.
Employees are the stake-holders most likely to take the long-term view
in any enterprise, being more concerned with job security than a quick
return on investment.
May I suggest that public and employee ownership are not mutually
exclusive. There is a strong argument for retaining ownership of assets
for the common good, while devolving democratic control to local
employees (and consumers) would make a more efficient use of these
assets, be they financial, physical, or human.
I am confident that the public perception of the inefficient,
unresponsive, monolithic structures which were the old nationalised
industries could be changed with the production of a text for the future
which combined common ownership of the means of production with more
localised control (community or employee or both) of the most efficient
way to maximise benefit for all stake-holders.

IT is some measure of their disunity that the French Socialists have
only now chosen their candidate for the presidential elections, the
first stage of which is only three months away. Theoretically the
Socialists should be in with a shout, for President Mitterrand, the
outgoing President, who has had two seven-year terms in office, is the
country's most prominent Socialist figure and has proved to have a
strong grip on power. At one stage it looked as if Mr Mitterrand could
have been succeeded by Jacques Delors, the former head of the EU
Commission. Mr Delors would have been an appealing candidate but he felt
he was not young enough, and anyway he was tired from his long and
gruelling time in Brussels. He may also have sensed the temper of the
national mood, at once more Euro-sceptical than ever and certainly
hostile to the Socialist Party. Mr Delors ruled himself out too firmly
to be drafted, and other attractive possibilities were ruled out at
standard bearers for the left by personal misfortune (like the radical
millionaire from Marseilles, Bernard Tapie, who is struggling to avoid
bankruptcy).
The man actually chosen, Lionel Jospin, is rather good all the same.
He is untainted by the corruption that damaged the French Socialists in
Mr Mitterrand's second term, both the way in which the President, ageing
and ill, was accused of appointing to office people whose main
credentials were his friendship, and the way in which the party took
huge bribes for its funds in return for awarding state contracts for
public works. Mr Jospin is an academic economist but has had plenty of
direct political experience: he was at one point Minister of Education,
and led the party in the early eighties. Mr Jospin lacks flamboyance but
he is not unknown, though unfortunately public awareness of him stems
from memories of fierce internal party battles in which he was a major
participant. The fact is that the French Socialists have fragmented. It
remains to be seen whether they can effectively unite to campaign and
whether he is the man to force union on them. Even united, however, the
Socialists have little chance of performing well. Their only hope was
that someone like Mr Delors would have had the individual personality
and record of achievement to ensure that people voted for him as a
person while ignoring his party label, the formula that Mr Mitterrand
was able to exploit himself.
Socialist division is not unique -- the right is witnessing the open
competition of Messrs Balladur and Chirac, the Prime Minister and Mayor
of Paris respectively, and there are others, like former President
Giscard d'Estaing, in the background. In their case division hardly
matters: each of the two main opponents is set to run ahead of all the
others. France looks like belonging to the right this year, and the main
question is how far the main candidates of the right will distance
themselves from Mr Le Pen's racist campaigning and, more intriguingly,
where they will place themselves in relation to the European Union.

THE smell of a General Election is in the air. It is not a pleasant
smell, no matter your political leanings. Any electoral contest fought
at the moment would be of a bitterness not encountered for many years.
It would be divisive in the extreme and the new Government, whatever its
complexion, would be faced with the task of gluing together a Humpty
Dumpty nation even before it could deal with the many long-term issues
which must be addressed, far less bringing forward the policies to do
so. Worse, if an election were held now it would be precipitated by, and
would pivot on, the issue of Ireland and possibly the European Union.
Despite the lengthy history of both issues the British public in general
is not intimately involved with either. Parliamentary arithmetic in the
case of Ireland and the internal affairs of the Conservative Party in
the case of Europe would provide the catalyst. Both would, and do,
generate enormous heat and light, yet the great issues such as the
economy, unemployment, and the National Health Service are the ones over
which people agonise. These would not be given due weight in a campaign
precipitated by other issues. This is an alarming scenario; it is as
unwanted as it is unlikely.
There are plenty of straws in the wind but at the moment they come to
nothing. The crisis over the selective leaking of the framework document
on Ireland has undoubtedly caused considerable damage to the Government
and there are some who profess to see a campaign by the right to
discredit and remove Mr Major. By this way of thinking the Ulster
Unionists would be sufficiently rattled by the revelations of alleged
duplicity to withdraw support for the Government. This concept was
superficially strengthened over the weekend when Mr James Molyneaux
placed his Ulster Unionists on an election footing. Ulster Unionists
are, for the most part, stern-faced and deeply serious men and women,
but this does not preclude political guile. Mr Molyneaux and his
colleagues are undoubtedly raising the stakes by applying pressure to Mr
Major. Similarly, they are exploring every avenue by probing Labour
Party attitudes to the issue. None of this means they are likely to
bring down the Government in the short term.
Much the same applies with Europe, although there are clear signs that
business figures are losing patience with Mr Major's attitude towards
their major trading partners within the European Union. The pound
sterling was knocked about at the end of last week on fears of a
Government collapse and, more surprisingly, The Economist magazine
insisted that if Mr Major's colleagues believe he will fight the next
election on an anti-European, nationalistic platform, they would be
justified in bringing his Government down. Mr Heseltine added to the
flames yesterday but, and we should be thankful for it, the sum of all
these parts is not yet an election.

IT is sad to see the modern world in conflict with tradition,
particularly when it threatens ancient crafts. Such a situation is
reported from Oxford, where a replacement is needed for the
nineteenth-century organ in the Sheldonian Theatre. The university's
Hebdomadal Council plans to install a #50,000 electronic device, with
loudspeakers hidden behind the existing pipes, while 37 protesting
scholars want to raise #250,000 for an organ built in the traditional
manner.
Being the king of instruments and the only one credited with a soul,
the organ arouses deep emotions. Just as railway enthusiasts travel the
world to board illustrious trains, organists make pilgrimages to the
Mighty Wurlitzer at Manchester, or book sessions on the Auditorium Organ
at Atlantic City, which can equal the sound of 25 brass bands. Like the
conflict between enthusiasts for steam and diesel-electric, however,
organists, too, are divided . . . those who welcomed the arrival of the
Hammond electric organ, for instance, and those who cherish historic
organs, like those which knew the fingers of Bach and Handel. Most
musicians have accepted, even welcomed, change. Bach would admire the
swift action and perfect pitch of modern organs. Mozart, after all,
switched with enthusiasm to the pianoforte. In earlier days, organs
required great strength to play, with organists having to strike the
keys with their fist and pull out stops up to a foot long. Modern organs
are not only instantaneous, but capable of millions of tones and
variable echo effects, able to simulate the acoustics of any auditorium
in the world.
At Oxford there may prove little choice in the matter, but it would be
a pity if electronics put traditional organ-building at risk. The young
organist of the past was taught to repair wooden trackers himself,
creeping dangerously about the loft with a candle. The organist of the
future may only need a soldering iron.

Comedy ace Stephen Fry has landed a new show, on mainstream TV. 'A
ruthless subversion of family values', the script, by Fry and his
soulmate Hugh Laurie, doesn't miss its targets.
STEPHEN FRY, wearing a tweed jacket, a science-teacher shirt, and what
would appear to be cavalry twill trousers, is recalling the day he tried
to get away from his tweed jacket, science-teacher shirt, and cavalry
twill trousers image. He turned up for an interview (with one of those
awful female-with-attitude Sunday paper columnists) wearing black
leathers and a motor-cycle helmet.
''And you know, she still started her story by describing me as
'tweedy Stephen Fry','' he says, with more than a hint of resignation.
''Obviously my head is made of tweed,'' he adds. Point one: this man is
no slave to fashion.
Fry, of course, makes a virtue of the fact that he is celibate. Which,
to be honest, is just as well since he's perhaps the most unsexual
creature on God's earth. He has an awkward, gangling, ungainly body and
a great face for radio. But -- and here is his saving grace -- he has
more talent than you could shake a stick at.
For a start there's his voice. A deep, cultured baritone. Silky smooth
Cambridge. Then there's his intellect. His IQ, one imagines, must be
staggering. His breadth of knowledge awesome. Point two: this man is a
clevercloggs.
He can act. He can write plays. And books. And movies. And newspaper
columns. He is also computer literate. And he is one of the funniest men
in showbiz. Which is why we are meeting in London's Lansdowne Club with
his long-time workmate/soulmate Hugh Laurie. The pair have just
completed work on a new series of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, which starts
a seven-week run later this month.
The new show, ''a ruthless subversion of family values'' according to
them; ''sophisticated sketch comedy'' according to the publicists, will
be broadcast on BBC1 instead of the comics' former stamping ground,
BBC2.
''Ah yes,'' quips Fry. ''The ugly bird mainstream was flapping its
wings. It is a faster current, after all.''
The new series, to judge by the first show, is certainly wickedly
amusing. It is even laugh-out-loud stuff. The pair, who wrote the
scripts themselves, sail wonderfully close to the winds of bad taste
(scatology is a big thing, nasty smells are another). But is there
anything they wouldn't touch for a joke?
''What would we not do?'' Laurie ponders aloud. ''I don't know. We'd
really have to write them first to see what we wouldn't do. I don't
think either of us sees any virtue in just shocking people for the hell
of it. I'd like to think that there is no such thing as a taboo subject
but I don't think that's true.''
Laurie recalls seeing fellow comic Tony Slattery being attacked on
C4's The Right To Reply recently over a sketch he did about wartime air
ace Douglas Bader -- the joke, of course, was about his artificial legs.
''Now Bader was a great national hero and a very courageous man. I saw
Reach For The Sky and I know he was an extraordinary man but it must be
possible to take things seriously and laugh at them at the same time,''
he explains.
Fry agrees. ''Just because you make fun of his walk doesn't mean
you're trashing his reputation.'' The fact is, he argues, there is
absolutely nothing a writer can do to prevent someone somewhere getting
upset by something he writes.
''A character could say 'Gosh, you nearly gave me a heart attack!' And
someone watching it at home will get upset because his mother or father
has just died from a heart attack. Anything you do could be offensive to
some people,'' he says.
Which brings us round to Michael Portillo and the grounds of good
taste. There's a passing gag in the first programme about the
much-maligned Employment Minister smelling just a tad unpleasant when he
steps out of his Rover 200 after a long journey. ''Surely smelling any
man as he comes out of a car after a long journey must be unpleasant,''
explains Fry. ''And if politicians are not fair game then God knows what
is.''
Fry and Laurie have been muckers since university days. They've been
writing together off an on for the best part of 15 years. They socialise
a lot and Hugh ''often takes pity on a sad and lonely bachelor'' and
takes Stephen home and feeds him. So does the writing get any easier?
''It's never easy to write three-and-a-half-hours worth of what they
call these days 'broken comedy' or non-continuous narrative, whereas
with situation comedy you have a stable thing to work with. It is always
hard work but I suppose, subconsciously, there are certain shorthands
and things we know about each other which make it easier,'' explains
Fry.
Laurie explains that, while working, they seldom disagree. ''We thrash
things out and work until an agreement is reached. We usually know if
the other one doesn't think something is working. One of us will start
with an idea and, about halfway through, he will let the other one have
a look at it. And within a fiftieth of a second you know it's not right
because he says 'No. It's very interesting. Excellent. Eh, funny.' And
you just know then that it's an absolute dog.''
The new series opens with a sketch about depression; about how life is
grey and hopeless. Well, we've all had those kind of days, haven't we?''
says Fry. ''It's all part of getting older. Everyone says nowadays that
they're glad they're not 19 now. They never said that 15 years ago.
There is this whole Generation X thing, this idea that there is a
generation of people in their 20s who are worse off than their parents
were. It's the first time that's happened since the war.''
Fry admits he's always been a naturally ''old to middle-aged person''.
He smoked a pipe when he was a teenager. ''I think I will come in to my
own in my sixties. When I was 19 people thought I was pompous, but what
sounds pompous in a teenager doesn't sound pompous when you're 60,'' he
explains.
Though their respective careers have been wildly successful so far,
neither claims to have coldly calculated his respective direction. Fry
in particular is happy that his future has never really been in his own
hands. ''I've been blown by the wind in everything I've done. I like the
fact that I've lucked into this and then lucked into that,'' he says.
So what next? This is a cue for an in-joke from Laurie. ''Well, the
traditional pattern is that one of us goes to Hollywood and flukes his
way into a multi-million dollar film while the other sits at home and
gets sad and lonely. I want you to guess which one that might be.''
Sheepishly, Fry admits to having just made a big-bucks comedy movie in
America with Meg Ryan. In IQ he plays a professor of experimental
psychology who's engaged to a mathematician (Ryan) who just happens to
be Albert Einstein's niece.
''It is, I suppose, what you might call an unromantic lead part. I'm
an emotionally constipated cold fish. My fiancee falls for Tim Robbins,
who plays a motor mechanic. There is one scene where she tries to make
love to me,'' he explains.
Currently, Fry is preparing to take the West End stage alongside his
old chum Rik Mayall in Cell Mates, a new play by Simon Gray.
''I play the spy George Blake who was sprung from Wormwood Scrubs in
the sixties -- at that time it was quite rare for someone to walk out of
prison -- and everyone assumed it was the work of the KGB. But, of
course, it wasn't. It was masterminded by an Irish petty criminal called
Sean Bourke with the help of a couple of Aldermaston campaigners.
''Rik plays Bourke and the point of the play, which takes place mostly
in Moscow, is the fact that Blake completely betrayed him. It is sort of
funny-ish and serious-ish in spots,'' he says.
The timing of Cell Mates, which starts its West End run in two weeks,
has meant that Fry and Laurie have been forced to cancel a live show
they had lined up in Scotland to support the Student Hardship Fund at
Dundee University (where Fry is rector).
''I was terribly distraught at having to cancel but these things do
happen. We've promised to re-schedule the show and we will recompense
anyone who has lost out financially.
''The rectorship is a wonderful thing. It's a terrible shame that the
English universities do not have a similar institution. It is great to
have someone elected by the students who, in effect, gets a seat on the
board,'' he says.
Both Fry and Laurie are currently under commission to write
screenplays for feature films. Laurie, superstitious about such things,
is reluctant to discuss his but Fry is more forthcoming.
It is an adaptation for Paramount of John Kennedy Toole's masterly
1970s novel, A Confederacy of Dunces, which is set in New Orleans.
Toole's personal story is as interesting as the novel itself. He wrote
it as a young man and hawked it around the American publishing houses
with no success. Disillusioned, he took his own life, but his mother
eventually sold it and it was published to great acclaim several years
after his death.
* A Bit of Fry and Laurie starts on Sunday, February 12, on BBC1.

RICHIE Dixon was pacing up and down like a caged animal on the morning
of Saturday's game. I was to interview him live from Dalmahoy for Iain
''Maaaarvellous'' Anderson's morning programme on radio, and, as usual,
I had arrived an hour too early. What seemed like 50 fags later we were
still talking intricacies.
Coaches all over the world will know the feeling of having taught,
cajoled, coached, prayed and then prayed some more in the build-up to a
big game. Comes a point, though, when all you can do is sit back and see
if it happens on the pitch the way you'd planned. But before that comes
the waiting for kick-off. What a time that is.
But I was curious. Most of us have, by now, spotted that the Scottish
team has completely changed its style of forward play.
To my mind, the pattern is now a combination of post-Telfer advanced
rucking, and pre-Nairn McEwan pass and handle on the rampage, and I was
trying to get straight in my mind how the players on the pitch were to
know where, when, why and how they were to pass before contact, or after
contact, or whether they were to ruck, maul, or try to spin out of the
tackle and link.
Dixon's answer surprised me. ''Many of us in Scotland have, for a
while now, been trying to depower the coaches and put more
responsibility into the hands of the players on the pitch,'' he said.
''The game is so complicated that to teach just one style, no matter
which one it is, is inappropriate because just one style won't work. The
forwards on the pitch, even in very tight situations, have to be able to
figure out what to do.''
That, it should be remembered, after a generation of Scottish forwards
have been led, almost by hand, by coaches who have defined a simple game
plan that should be stuck to.
So how do they know when to do what nowadays then? That I was keen to
have answered, and his reply took my puff away.
''Obviously,'' he said, ''the man in possession isn't the best person
to know what's going on. Players around him are far better off, so what
we have done is devise a system where the man coming in support of the
ball-carrier tells the ball-carrier what to do.''
''What?'' I said, like a little boy in a sweetie shop. ''You mean you
can actually get the person behind the ball carrier to tell him, on the
international pitch, how to get the ball to him, or not, as the case may
be?''
''Yes,'' said Dixon, anxiously lighting up another fag. ''We have a
system of calls, names, words that we can use. There aren't many of
them, and they work.''
Dixon has been famous for some time for devising calls in open play.
On the tour of the South Seas, his simple commands were used to good
effect. ''Weld'', screamed at full volume in the middle of a panicky
maul, soon persuaded players to ''weld'' their hips and shoulders
together. ''Ruck,'' well that one was fairly obvious. ''Shape it up,''
was another that told the players to get to grips, slow it down, and get
a maul in place.
I did my best to look like Bambi in plead mode, got down on one knee,
and asked the question. ''Ahem, Richie . . . old pal,'' I started.
''What are the calls that the team use on the pitch now, if, say, for
instance, just supposing I, as the supporting player, think that the
ball-carrier could banjo the tackler and give me a wee pass?'' I waited.
''Bump and birl,'' said Dixon. ''That one's bump and birl. It tells
the man what to do. It works.''
I swallowed hard. This was top-secret stuff. ''And the rest?''
''Bugger off,'' said Dixon, with a smile.
I smiled, I'd stretched it I knew, so there were no hard feelings.
Just then the phone went for the interview, so the chance was lost, and
anyway, that was all I was getting.
As it transpired, this new, and difficult tactic certainly worked in
part on the pitch later that day, but it will always be difficult,
absolutely, to get a ball from hand to hand among hard running forwards,
at close range, on the big pitch and I spotted twice when it went awry
on Saturday, but more often than not it did work, and, anyway, it is
only in its infancy.
I felt privileged. By the way, if you have any English friends then
this article will self-destruct in 15 seconds. The man behind in
control, who would ever have thought of it?
As Big Jill from Haddington says, ''Sometimes you need to shout at the
top of your voice to tell the man in possession just what's best for you
. . .'' Absolutely.

ANGRY students are planning ''smoke-ins'' to protest against a smoking
ban at a Scottish college.
The student smokers claim that they were not properly consulted about
the ban introduced by Perth College at the start of term.
More than 200 copies of a protest letter have been sent by individual
students to the college Principal.
The students say the withdrawal of smoking areas has forced them to
stand outside in the cold weather and infringes their human rights.
The college has responded with an offer of counselling for students
who want to give up smoking.
Now the student association has voted to hold protest smoke-ins unless
the college provides indoor smoking amenities by the end of the week.
Student association president George McCurrach said: ''This blanket
ban is too inflexible. It is ridiculous to expect people to stand
outside for a smoke in the middle of winter.
''Unless the college reinstates the designated smoking areas we had
before or provides shelter for our smokers we will be taking action.''
Ms Louise Nowell, the college's marketing manager, said: ''This ban
applies to staff as well as students. It was decided after a survey of
students and the ban reflects the views of the majority of students.''

Scotland 26, Ireland 13
IT lacked form, it lacked rhythm, a thing of classical beauty it most
decidely was not, but it had passion and brio in abundance and, more
than anything, it had Hastings.
The Scottish skipper, winning his record-breaking fifty-third cap for
Scotland, saved his best performance in years to crown the day which he
made his own with an outstanding display encompassing both exemplary
leadership and a priceless 16 points from the boot.
They said he was too old, too slow, and that his back was shot to
pieces. The back may indeed be suffering from the ravages of nine years'
service in his country's cause but Hastings silenced the carping
critics, and in the process boosted not only his stature but his
international points' tally to a remarkable 504.
The victory over Canada a fortnight ago was but the first rung on the
ladder from the gloomy basement in which the Scots had gone for nine
games without a win.
For the opening 45 minutes of this Royal Bank international at
Murrayfield, it looked like the Scots had fallen off that ladder.
They seemed destined to slide down the slippery snake and return to
square one in double-quick time.
Mixing the board-game metaphor, the Scottish manager Duncan Paterson
observed later that, when his side reached the turn 9-8 ahead, they had
got out of jail for free.
Ireland took the first-half honours, with Hastings' three penalty
goals keeping the Scots in the hunt.
If Hastings' prowess with the boot was the life-support machine which
kept the Scots alive and kicking -- particularly in the first half --
then, by comparison, the Irish fly-half Paul Burke had an abysmal day.
He put the kick-off out ''on the full'' and missed an easy penalty
attempt after two minutes. And it got worse. With a goal-kicking strike
rate of one-from-five Burke must feel the deposed Eric Elwood breathing
down his neck.
Scotland were under intense pressure for much of the opening period.
There was little continuity to the play and that suited the Irish just
fine. The lineouts were a lottery and both sides suffered from poor
quality possession.
After Hastings and Burke had traded penalty goals, the Irish scored
the only try of the opening period, Brendan Mullin making it 3-8. Johns
peeled round the lineout tail before Bradley, Burke and Danaher moved
second-phase ball to carve out the opening for the aristocratic Mullin.
The wretched Burke missed the conversion and his dismay was complete
when Hastings struck two further penalty goals to give the Scots a
single point lead at the interval, a lead they scarcely deserved.
Scotland began the second half with their tails up, Redpath, Chalmers
and the inestimable Eric Peters driving play deep into Irish territory.
But they suffered a set-back when Welsh referee Derek Bevan --
officiating in a world-record twenty-sixth international match -- pulled
up Stewart Campbell at a lineout.
From the free kick inside the Scots' twenty-two the ball was whipped
left into open field and Bradley, Burke, Mullin, plus the intruding
O'Shea, sent Jonathan Bell speeding along the left touchline to touch
down at the corner flag. There was a hint of ''foot in touch'' but Craig
Joiner's despairing tackle could not prevent the Ballymena winger from
putting the Irish 13-9 ahead.
But from that point on it was all Scotland. The pack, with Damian
Cronin once again rising to the occasion, played with fire in their
bellies and the Irish were denied the possession which they had enjoyed
-- but not utilised fully -- in the first 45 minutes.
The Scottish front row more than held their own with their Irish
counterparts. Peter Wright was as conspicuous in the loose as Popplewell
and never more so than when he pulled off a miraculous covering tackle
on Jonathan Bell.
The turning point came in the fifty-fifth minute and it was just
reward for some spirited Scottish play.
Cronin stole ruck ball and Hastings, careering at pace towards the
left touchline, chipped ahead for Logan. The Stirling County wing, who
invariably sent a buzz around the ground on the few occasions he got a
sniff of the ball, was illegally tackled by Geoghegan as he went for the
pick-up, but got his foot to the ball.
The ball bobbled free in the Irish in-goal area and Craig Joiner
swooped like an avenging angel to score his first international try.
Hastings made it 16-13 with the conversion and the Scots were never
again headed.
Joiner's try will have given the youngster -- who still looked
''green'' on occasions -- a confidence boost and he will benefit from
that. Of the other Scottish backs, Chalmers came on to a satisfactory
line-kicking game in the second half but he will regret some overstruck
restart kicks and a half-hearted drop-goal effort.
The debate over the Townsend-Jardine centre partnership will continue
despite the win and the selectors will have noted the performance of
Tony Stanger and Scott Hastings in Friday's A game against the Irish.
Stanger, in particular, is the kind of solid citizen, with the added
ingredient of extra pace, who could fulfil the duties now expected of
Jardine at inside centre.
The Scottish skipper maintained his 100% strike rate with a penalty
goal after 55 minutes and, in so doing, became the first European player
to score more than 500 points. The Scots were in complete command now
and their domination was underlined with Cronin's try after 63 minutes.
''Del Boy'' had set the try sequence in motion with driven lineout
ball. Redpath, Chalmers and Townsend set up the ruck on the Irish line
and when Peters' initial breenge was impeded, Cronin used all of his
17st 10lbs to drive over and touch down single-handed.
Hastings struck his sixth successful goal kick from six attempts to
make it 26-13 and no matter that he missed with two penalty efforts in
the time that remained.
Big Gav had written his own script and it was straight from the pages
of Boys' Own paper.

Clare Henry looks at a project launched 10 years ago which has become
a truly nationwide show.
TEN years ago Paisley Art Institute saw a gap in the market and
initiated one of Scotland's most useful projects: The Scottish Drawing
Competition. Thanks to money from Marks and Spencer and the MacFarlane
Trust it got off to a flying start with winners like Ian Howard and
Peter Howson.
Now, with exhibitors from Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and
all points in between, plus prize money of #2550, the sixth exhibition
demonstrates that it's truly a nationwide show -- if not quite as high
powered as it was. It might be a good idea to invite one key artist per
year (someone like Hockney, Blake, Davie, or Bellany), to give it a
focus.
Often if drawings are hung side by side with paintings, they lose out
so a separate exhibition is a bright idea. People generally seem less
ready to buy drawings, although why I can't imagine, as Scots excel in
good draughtsmanship. However, this time the prices are a bit steep.
The show is at Paisley Art Gallery (till March 4) but is organised by
Paisley Art Institute which has a healthy membership -- no doubt because
it avoids the notorious cliques of Glasgow's equivalent RGI. Judges
include David Michie from Edinburgh College of Art and Sandy Moffat of
Glasgow School of Art, plus representatives from Paisley and M &amp; S.
The M &amp; S winner is Tom Calder with a Giacometti-type drawing of Yoker
Shipyards which loom from the mist like ghostly presences, the skeleton
of a ship a dark spectre alongside tall elongated buildings squashed
along the river. Monochrome tonalities of grey and black are alleviated
by touches of faint pink while the geometric shapes are mellowed by
scratchy ink and pencil outlines. This is not an easy image but its
message of a forlorn community and disappearing way of life will strike
a chord with viewers.
Roseleen Orr, who wins the N S MacFarlane Trust award, has a more
lyrical approach and her drawing of Orpheus is set in a wooded landscape
populated by birds who gather to listen to his magical violin. This
romantic setting is in fact Kilbarchan with the church in the background
providing an ideal foil to the handsome youth. Mark I'Anson wins the
Millers Art Shop prize for his mysterious scenario of puppet figures
dressed in a version of Commedia del Arte costume complete with masks,
saucepans, and ladders. While his work has a curious moody quality, I'm
less sure about his predilection for soft boneless dolls.
The student prizes are no doubt dictated by age but I really didn't
see much merit in Katie Ward's prize-winning After You My Dear. The
figure's articulation seems misguided to say the least. That she can
draw is evident from another of her sketches, Doppelganger, where two
nude girls, clad just in stockings, giggle and whisper. The last prize
goes to Sorena Dallas for an unremarkable self-portrait. Here again her
alternative Spoon image is more interesting.
Judging is a difficult business. The overall quality of the 230 works
must have led to a lot of head-scratching. There may be no breathtaking
highs but there are few lows and life drawing is especially good.
Few beat Helen Wilson's acutely caught portraits, but I also admired
Emma Brook's very nicely handled painting (when is a work on paper not a
drawing?), Evan Gray's head thrown back and George Papaioannon and Gerry
McMonagle's super-realist detail. Liz Knox employs a nice economy of
line in Sadie while I really liked Neil McIvor's bold chalk drawing of
Jeremiad and Tom McDonald's lady with hooped earrings. Josephine
Graham's Girl and Cat would melt any heart and I bet the judges gave
serious thought to Adrian O'Donnell's fine Foundryman.
Good artists can find inspiration anywhere. Dawson Murray's drawings
of Spanish grainstores perched on termite-proof stone stilts are
captured with relish and a carefree pen. A pair of strappy sandals is
enough to spark off T Thompson.
Among all this serious stuff, witty works are doubly welcome. James
McNaught's Grenouille the Perfumer is a triumph of metaphor with tubes,
flasks, phials, sprays, and bottles of scent. Even better is McNaught's
sexy Long Sniff which brings forth a smile as well as admiration for the
way he manipulates a line and a thread.
Another artist with a unique vision is Jackie Marno whose squint-eyed
folk and odd animals have a distinctive stamp. Julie Freeman's little
dancing girls on pink wallpaper is also out of the ordinary, while
Rosann Cherubini's Give Your Heart is apt for February 14.
As a bonus visitors to Paisley can see William Armour's very special
and strong 1920s portraits of his wife, Mary Armour -- and hers of him,
plus an array of pastel portraits of children. Armour taught at Glasgow
School of Art, has work in many public collections including the
Scottish National Gallery and the Louvre, and lived in Kilbarchan from
1953 until his death 1979. Many of the portraits still belong in the
village and are a poignant record of its youngsters through a quarter of
a century, among them an unmistakable likeness of Herald radio critic
Joyce McMillan!

JODAMI bounced back to his best to complete an unprecedented hat trick
in the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup at Leopardstown yesterday.
He got back on the Cheltenham Gold Cup trail with a three lengths
defeat of Merry Gale, who fought out a tremendous battle before
conceding defeat halfway up the run in.

Nostalgia remains the same, David Belcher finds as he catches up with
the Rubettes.
IT was the elongated falsetto shriek that lured you in, I think. Two
parts Frankie Valli to one part street-corner newspaper vendor.
Eeeee-yaaarrr ooo-arr-arr-arr-ee-arr dooby doo-waaa-ee-aaaarrrr. The
rest of the lyrics possessed a certain primal naffness, too.
How did the rest of the song go? Come on, baby, do the jukebox jive.
Just like they did in nineteen sixty-five.
Ah yes, Juke Box Jive by the Rubettes. Right in there alongside
Showaddywaddy at the start of the great British pop nostalgia boom.
Lastingly lamenting the demise of nineteen sixty-five in
nineteen-seventy-five. And in nineteen eighty-five. And, well . . . this
year as well, actually.
Aye, it's a funny old game, pop. As if to underline the fact that
nostalgia remains what it used to be, the Rubettes will tonight be
inviting Edinburgh folk to do it like they did in nineteen sixty-five,
again, in nineteen ninety-five.
Modest head-Rubette Alan Williams never thought it would last for 20
years. He and his cohorts weren't even a proper band at the time they
recorded their first big hit, Sugar Baby Love.
''We were a clique of sessions musicians, a studio rhythm section
who'd had success by playing on No 1 hits like Carl Douglas's Kung Fu
Fighting, Lynsey de Paul's Sugar Me, and Dancing On A Saturday Night by
Barry Blue. We recorded Sugar Baby Love as a demo for other artists to
listen to, and thankfully for us no-one wanted it.''
The Rubettes' chart dominance was brief, the band having been forced
into dormancy between 1979 and 1984, but they are now on their third
major UK tour during the past five years, and they have continued to do
well on the continental nostalgia circuit. Nostalgia -- is it hard to
accept that your future resides in the past?
''We're simply happy still to be in the music business at this mature
stage in our lives, still touring, still making records. If we're not
actual pop stars, we're making a living in music -- and that was my big
ambition when I started.
''But just yesterday our current British single, Believe In You, with
a French singer, Nathalie L'Hermitte, went into the British country
radio chart at 20, so we might have a surprise hit on our hands out of
nowhere. And after having recorded nothing new for a while, we've an
album, Making Love In The Rain, released next week on the label that I
run, Dice.''
It makes the bad times worthwhile. Giving up the pop high life to
start a not wholly successful business making and designing exhibition
stands in his Essex homelands. Thankfully, Alan managed to hang on to
the most tangible reward from his top 10 days: his own plane, which he
pilots himself.
''I've a Piper Aztec twin-engined six-seater. We'll be flying to
Scotland in it. We're all about five minutes from Southend airport so
it's been handy lately for nipping over to do daytime TV stuff in Europe
and then getting back for gigs in the evening.''
Sounds better than being a journalist, which is what the Rubettes'
original guitarist now is, on a local newspaper in Burnley. Their first
drummer is a Hare Krishna devotee. Otherwise, the same Rubettes seem
likely to be doing the jukebox jive in two thousand and twenty-five.
All together now: Eeeee-yaaarrr ooo-arr-arr-arr-ee-arr dooby
doo-waaa-ee-aaaarrrr.
* The Rubettes appear tonight in Edinburgh's Usher Hall, assisted by
vintage popsters the Tremeloes, Mungo Jerry, and Marmalade. Three weeks
later, the tour wends its way back to Scotland with gigs in Perth City
Hall (February 27), Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall (February 28), and
Aberdeen's Capitol Theatre (March 1).

Toronto, Sunday -- The world's seven richest powers unanimously gave
their blessing to a US-led $50bn rescue package for Mexico but warned it
was now up to the Mexicans to fix their crippling economic problems.
After two days of talks, finance ministers and central bankers from
the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada put
aside their differences and expressed ''total satisfaction'' for the
efforts to aid Mexico which had teetered on the brink of financial
collapse.
The economic policymakers also agreed on the need for an early warning
system to avoid a similar crisis in future.
''The support is unequivocal for the Mexican package,'' said Canadian
Finance Minister Paul Martin, who chaired the meeting of the so-called
Group of Seven nations in Toronto.
But US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said: ''In the final analysis
the resolution of Mexico's financial distress depends on Mexico.''
As the Mexican peso and stock market nose-dived leading up to the
meeting, the United States and its European allies were at odds over the
handling of the last-minute $50bn bail-out cobbled together by US
President Bill Clinton.
The package includes $20bn from the US, another $10bn from its
Japanese and European allies through the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) and $17.8bn from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), its biggest-ever loan.
In a rare show of diplomatic pique, six key European countries,
including Germany and Britain, abstained when the board of the IMF voted
on the Mexico rescue on Wednesday saying the US had not properly
consulted them.
The exclusive club of the world's richest nations tried on Saturday to
brush aside the rift. ''To the extent that there was any ill-will, I
think we've eliminated it,'' said Rubin. ''Our consultations were not as
full as we would have liked. But we had to act in a very short time.''
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke also papered over the
cracks saying the abstentions ''really reflected the fact that details
were still to be resolved''.
The BIS, which will be channelling aid funds from Europe and Japan, is
due to discuss details of its $10bn package in Basle, Switzerland, next
weekend.
Mr Clarke said it was important Mexico remain focused on the austere
programme of government spending cuts and tight credit. ''The Mexican
programme is certainly a very demanding one and we shall need to ensure
that it is delivered.''
In contrast to Mexico's woes, the G7 spoke optimistically about the
state of the global economy and said they remained committed to currency
stability. Economic growth has been robust, inflation is moderate, job
creation is improving and unemployment rates are falling in most
countries.
''The challenge now is to ensure that we sustain growth,'' Mr Martin
said, adding there was no room for complacency on reducing fiscal
deficits around the world.
At the two-day meeting, Japan assured its partners that its economy
could continue to grow despite the damage from the Kobe earthquake in
January. Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura said Japan is making its
best efforts to cope with reconstruction.
But the G7 had harsher words for Russia, saying that they are
concerned the recent rise in inflation and the war in Chechnya may throw
Moscow off the course of economic reform.
''The financial impact of the war in Chechnya threatens to burst the
Russian budget; because of that, the outlook for a stabilisation of
Russia's economy will be further endangered,'' German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel said.
In the wake of the Mexico crisis, the G7 ministers debated ways of
setting up a structure of surveillance and early warnings to prevent
future Mexico-like shocks to the financial system but differed over the
idea of a ''rapid relief fund''.
France's Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said there was a need for
''more permanent processes'' and an apparatus to allow quick fundraising
in the international community.
But Mr Clarke was strongly against such a fund. ''The best reaction to
these affairs is not to start piling up huge funds of this kind which
you're ready to rush in with when something goes wrong,'' he said.
Mr Martin said the G7 did agree to explore ways to improve the ability
of institutions such as the IMF to ''monitor and, when warranted,
respond to economic instability''.
Canada is expected to make reform of the IMF and its sister World
Bank, which lends to poor countries, a major agenda item at the summit
of G7 leaders in Halifax, Nova Scotia, next June. -- Reuter.

* Kyrgyzstan today held its first post-independence election for a
two-chamber parliament set up to replace the Soviet-era legislature that
President Askar Akayev threw out last year after it blocked his reforms.
Nearly 1000 candidates were standing for the 35-seat legislative
assembly, a full-time lawmaking body, and the 70-seat People's Assembly,
which will meet twice a year.
With so many running, few outright winners were expected in the first
round of voting. Preliminary results were due tomorrow and Akayev urged
voters to follow up today's balloting by turning out again for the
runoffs on February 19.
A 50% turnout is required to make the election valid. By mid-afternoon
62% of the electorate had voted, the central election commission said.
A dozen parties are participating and the Communists have the most
candidates with 40. But parties have put up less than a fifth of those
running, leaving most voters to make a rough choice on the basis of
name, age, race or profession.
Casting his own vote in mid-morning at School 24 in Bishkek, Akayev
said the array of candidates had forced voters to make tough choices and
he predicted the election would return a parliament representing the
full spectrum of Kyrgyz society.--Reuter.

KEN Oliver may be the oldest trainer in Britain, but he has not lost
his appetite for winners as he showed at Wetherby on Saturday, when Bula
Nuday triumphed in a novices' chase.
For Oliver, who celebrated his eighty-first birthday last Wednesday,
it was his second success of the season -- and he confidently expects to
notch up another at Ayr on Saturday with Golden Fiddle, his promising
Irish import who won so impressively at the Boxing Day meeting.
At Ayr 10 days ago, Bula Nuday looked as if he was going to break his
duck over fences when he took a comfortable lead two from home in a
handicap chase, but he lost momentum on the flat and was caught close to
the line by Fast Cruise. It almost happened again on Saturday in the
Skipton Novices Chase, when he was left in front three fences out.
Despite the efforts of jockey Brian Storey he ''tied up'' on the
run-in, but this time Bula Nuday (100-30) just held on to beat Cool
Weather.
''He should have won at Ayr, but doesn't want to be left in front,''
explained the veteran trainer, who first took out a licence 35 years
ago.
Oliver was unable to be at Wetherby, but David Greig, the sprightly
77-year-old owner, was there to greet his winner.
Oliver and Greig are one of the longest-running double acts in racing.
They raced together as amateurs 50 years ago. The pair had their
greatest success when Cockle Strand, trained by Oliver and owned by
Greig, won the 1982 Scottish National.

Grozny, Sunday
Russian forces laid down a heavy artillery bombardment on the smashed
Chechen capital Grozny today and a large armoured column moved towards
the city as rebels continued to resist the Kremlin after eight weeks of
war.
The intense pounding, which made the ground shake several miles away,
began in the early afternoon. The Russians earlier shelled the southern
suburb of Aldy, where separatist Chechen fighters were holding firm.
Correspondents saw a Russian armoured column, including tanks and
armoured personnel carriers, moving towards Grozny from the direction of
Samashky, 18 miles to the west.
One Chechen fighter who had been in action in southwest Grozny said
his group was pulling back after losing 18 men in the morning alone. He
said they had come under sustained attack from Russian Grad multiple
rocket launchers.
A Russian government statement said the Chechens were still putting up
''fierce resistance'' in parts of Grozny to give the forces of rebel
leader Dzhokhar Dudayev time to set up defence lines elsewhere in the
ruined city.
It also said Russian forces killed 350 Chechen fighters and captured
10 armoured vehicles yesterday. Similar claims have proved exaggerated
in the past.
The Russian forces made loudspeaker announcements calling on Chechen
fighters in the southwest of the city to lay down their arms, saying the
army would otherwise not be responsible for the consequences.
But the rebels, who shot down a Russian fighter-bomber yesterday,
vowed to fight on despite being hugely outgunned and outnumbered.
Russian air power has had a devastating effect during the campaign,
with many civilians killed in bombing raids on Grozny and other Chechen
towns.
The shooting down of the plane, which the Chechens say they hit with a
standard anti-aircraft gun, raised a prospect of reprisals.
Previous attacks by Chechen irregulars on the Russians in the small
towns and villages of Chechnya have met with a brutal reponse.
Itar-Tass news agency quoted military sources in Nazran in the
neighbouring region of Ingushetia as saying Russian forces began an
assault at dawn on the village of Yermolovka, 10 miles southwest of
Grozny.
In an effort to block the rebels' freedom of movement, Russia has been
tightening its grip on the remaining open roads south and west of
Grozny.
Chechen fighters near the settlement of Chechenaul, south of Grozny,
said Russian tanks had taken control of a vital road junction.
Despite a firestorm of shells and bombs directed at Grozny, Chechen
fighters still control large sections of the city south and southeast of
the Sunzha river.
The rebels, moving usually in small groups that are difficult to
target, have staged an effective hit and run campaign from Grozny's
basements and back streets.
Dudayev was reported to be still in Grozny. Ali Aliyev, the chairman
of the Confederation of Caucasian Peoples, told Interfax news agency he
recently spoke to Dudayev in the city.--Reuter.

KINGUSSIE'S grip on the north shinty championship tightened
considerably at the weekend and, barring a major upset in their
remaining two games, they will clinch a record-breaking tenth successive
title.
Kingussie must take three points from the remaining four available to
make absolutely certain, but, given Fort William's second-half collapse
when they met on Saturday, Kingussie could well yet be beneficiaries of
the Fort's infamous capacity to shoot themselves in the foot at the last
hurdle.
Fort can now achieve a maximum of 24 points from their remaining games
while Kingussie already have 22 with two games left.
The reigning champions actually went a goal down in 22 minutes when
Victor Smith drove home, levelled through Ali Borthwick before the
interval.
However, in the second period Fort lost control of midfield and
Kingussie swept to victory with three goals, two from top scorer Ronald
Ross within a minute on the hour.
Ally Dallas completed the scoring in 84 minutes. Results:
North: Glenmorangie Qualifying Cup. North final -- Caberfeidh 1,
Lovat 2.
Marine Harvest League. Division 1 -- Fort William 2, Kingussie 4;
Lochaber 5, Beauly 2; Skye 1, Glenurquhart 4. Division 3 -- Beauly 1,

South: Marine Harvest League. Division 1 -- Ballachulish 0, Kyles

AS the scratchy recording of Jerusalem reached its triumphal climax
upon Morrissey's entrance -- oo-er! -- one mused idly on Friday night
about the sort of green and not unpleasant musical hinterland His
plangent miserabilism has builded here.
Eleven years on, Morrissey's mildly disaffected, ennui-laden songs
remain manna for those who value a warm bath in self-pity. Callow bedsit
hearts in humdrum towns, living straitened existences which are
routinely riven by unbearable yearnings and desperate questions: which
shirt to flounce in? Which book to be seen reading? Whom to idealise
deathlessly and from afar?
Morrissey Himself, of course, was the answer to the latter question
for the relentless stream of young male supplicants who eluded security
and materialised on stage with their hero. There was much brotherly
hugging of Morrissey's flanks; the occasional chaste kiss planted on His
cheek; the odd instance of sexually ambivalent kneeling at His feet, and
then meek submission to removal by bouncers.
Morrissey's demeanour throughout was unwaveringly saintly, a blend of
placid bemusement and languid resignation. Probably the best way for a
post-modern pop icon to behave, really. Mostly, though, you have to
admire Morrissey for His camp Northern drollery, His informed grasp of
the laws of proletarian melodrama, evinced by His creation of such
impossible lyrics as: You won't smile until my loving mouth is shut good
and proper, forever.
''Aw, shurrup,'' He told the milling throng at one point, and I saw
more clearly who Morrissey is. I'll go to the foot of our stairs. Bet
Lynch has forsaken Coronation Street, picked up a punkabilly quartet,
and is proselytising on behalf of a love which dares to speak one name .
. . Morrissey!

IF he'd done nothing else, Iain Matthews would still be revered -- and
rightly so -- by a small coterie of admirers for his series of
beautifully considered 1970s albums. Journeys from Gospel Oak, Valley
Hi, Some Days You Eat The Bear; they all still sound good. But, as he
was keen to point out, he has moved on. Back then he was an astute
interpreter of other people's songs; he has long since moved his own
material centre stage.
His voice, although always effective, was never a big instrument and
suffered here from under-amplification, not to mention the competition
from chatterboxes and wheezing electronic glass washers. It remains
youthfully high and sweet, belying his between-song reminiscing about
arriving in London, from Lincolnshire, just as the 60s were beginning to
swing. The cause of these reminiscences, The London That I Used To Know,
juxtaposed some fairly bitter observations on urban life with a melody
and guitar arrangement that couldn't have been more rural.
More in keeping with his current base (Austin, Texis) were the
harder-edged chord sequence behind Lamb in Armour and the
acoustic-guitar-as-entire-band-pattern that drove a disdainful look at
the music business. All was not well, however, and despite an
unaccompanied reading of Richard Thompson's From Galway to Graceland
which managed to elicit even more compassion for the deluded heroine
than the original version, Matthews appeared increasingly unhappy with
his surroundings, ending with a rather cursory semi-rap and a far from
reluctant walk off the stage.

FATE and death were the subjects Sir Alexander Gibson had chosen for
the first of his concerts entitled Mahler and More at the Edinburgh
Festival Theatre. In the event, with David Shallon as his substitute,
the programme became an elaborately morbid memorial to him, moving
through the claustrophobia of Strauss's Death and Transfiguration and
Mahler's Kindertotenlieder before reaching the drama of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony.
When the Royal SNO appeared last year in the same surroundings -- with
Sir Alex himself as conductor -- the players were placed, to dim effect,
behind the proscenium arch. The BBC SSO, brought well forward, sounded
considerably better, even if the clear (though by no means dry)
acoustics exposed every little mishap, of which there were more than
there should have been.
The Strauss fared best, profiting from the operatic environment in a
way that the other works did not. As a result, a work which, in the
concert hall, can sound the most squalid of Strauss's symphonic poems
gained some of the radiance of Rosenkavalier.
The Mahler, with Linda Finnie replacing an indisposed Kathryn Harries,
never quite gained the music's sense of aching calm. She sang it with
what sounded like two or three different voices, none of them quite
right. Nor, orchestrally, was beauty of line sufficiently sustained.
As for the Beethoven, it was all a bit of a trudge. Such interest as
the performance possessed derived more from the theatrical ambience than
from the conductor's sensible, somewhat stolid interpretation. Though
the playing rose to Beethoven's highpoints -- the reprise of the scherzo
had ample atmosphere -- it accepted the rest of the work at face value.

Jennifer Cunningham reports how cuts in airport security monitoring
could be inviting disaster.
AWEEK ago the Transport Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney, took a verbal
mauling in the Commons because security for the Channel Tunnel had been
found to be far short of his assurances that it would be comparable to
that at airports. Now we know that he had already sanctioned a 30% cut
in the Department of Transport staff who police international airport
security.
The confidence of European and North American airline passengers that
they were exempt from acts of terrorism was shatttered when PanAm Flight
103 exploded over Lockerbie. The Maritime and Aviation Security Act,
passed with all-party support in the chastening wake of that disaster,
gave more powers to Transec, the section of the Department of Transport
responsible for security on air, sea, and rail transport and at airports
and ports. A security specialist from the Ministry of Defence, Harry
Ditmas, was seconded to implement it.
Mr Ditmas now must give up 34 posts in Transec -- one-third of his
staff -- which was due to reach full strength only in 1996. Making the
best of a bad job, his memo to staff explains why Transec security
inspections of foreign airports will cease.
''The UK accepts the principle of host state responsibility: that is,
that each state is responsible for the security of flights departing
from it . . . In the light of experience we now believe that host state
responsibility can be undermined by our inspections of overseas airports
and that the security of our airlines would be better served by focusing
Transec's efforts on working with foreign governments through
international and bilateral agreements.''
The problem with that is summed up by Paul Wilkinson, Professor of
International Relations at the University of St Andrews, who said:
''International aviation is only as strong as its weakest link.''
We have only to look as far back as Christmas Eve when a French Airbus
300 was hijacked at Algiers to acknowledge that the weak links can be
very close to home. The hijackers killed three hostages and threatened
to fly on a suicide mission to crash over Paris before the incident
ended with the deaths of the four hijackers at Marseilles. The Algerian
authorities immediately admitted lapses in airport security.
Christopher Dobson, a writer specialising in terrorism, acknowledges
that responsibility of the host state can be undermined by security
inspections by another country, but says the strength of international
agreements depends on the systems at individual airports.
''Algiers springs immediately to mind. The problem is where you get a
combination of terrorism and lax security combined with some member of
the security staff actually being on the terrorists' side.''
Professor Wilkinson agreed that airport security is variable in
quality. ''Simply relying on the goodwill of countries is inviting
disaster. The Transec system -- and also the American system -- looked
at overseas airports and allowed quite strong measures to be taken if
their airports did not meet the standards. I welcomed that work when it
was allotted to Transec by the Maritime and Aviation Security Act. One
of the things that came out of the inquiries after Lockerbie into
avaition security generally was the importance of some monitoring and
enforcement provisions.''
Relaxed security after the end of the Cold War and with the prospect
of a peace agreement over Northern Ireland would be premature, he said.
''We cannot assume the threat from terrorism is receding. Only last
week we had a clear demonstration of just how fragile the peace process
is. If the Unionists are up in arms and the Loyalists break their
commitment to continued negotiations on the grounds that they have been
led up the garden path, we could be back into a violent situation very
quickly.
''Even if we take the most optimistic view on Northern Ireland,
Britain is at risk from spillage from the Middle East situation. It is
no good assuming that all governments are on the right side and set up
the right procedures.
''We cannot say that terrorists have suddenly lost interest in
aviation. There was a terrorist hijacking en route to Tokyo which
resulted in the death of a passenger. A new dimension is the Channel
Tunnel where security is both a French and British affair and has to
look at the international enemies of both Britain and France.''

Cape Canaveral, Sunday
FUEL spouting from a leaking jet thruster today forced Russian and US
engineers to draw up a new plan for Discovery's historic rendezvous with
Russia's orbiting space station Mir.
With the fly-by set for tomorrow, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration all but abandoned plans for a close approach because of
Russian fears that the shuttle's spewing nitrogen tetroxide would damage
the space station and a Soyuz capsule docked there.
''It's really their call,'' Randy Stone, Nasa's mission operations
director, said today. ''We have an agreement to fly in to 400ft,'' Stone
told a news conference after officials on both sides of the globe ended
two days of negotiations.
Stone told reporters that Discovery would fly no closer unless ground
controllers and the astronauts found a way to fix the thruster, which
sprung a leak minutes after the Friday lift-off from Florida.
''I don't believe it's a closed issue,'' he said, adding that a
decision to go on in could be made at any time during the rendezvous.
The repair attempts continued as the shuttle crew got ready to turn in
for the night. The four men and two women were not in danger.
Stone described Russian engineers' work on the problem as ''extremely
thorough'' and said their reluctance to let Discovery draw near was
understandable.
Original plans called for Discovery to fly as close as 33ft, then back
away and circle the space station.
Before the flight, the United States and Russia agreed that the
shuttle would stay at a distance of 1000ft unless certain of its 44
steering jets were working properly.
The leaking thruster is not needed for the rendezvous, but it is
attached to the same manifold -- a propellant pipe system -- as another
jet that would be used to rendezvous under the Russian-US agreement.
Eileen Collins, Nasa's first woman shuttle pilot, was assigned to
monitor shuttle systems during the rendezvous and was not scheduled to
be at the controls.
For his part, Discovery commander Jim Wetherbee said yesterday that he
would be ''very disappointed'' if he could not fly the rendezvous as
planned.
A second, larger leak erupted in a thruster on Discovery's nose late
yesterday, leading to a momentary scare.
Wetherbee and Collins managed to stop the leak by closing a manifold
and firing the jet to blow out an apparent blockage.
This morning, Discovery was 2300 miles behind the space station and
gaining 219 miles with each 90-minute circuit of Earth.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Hospital demands to see needle 'left in baby'</HEADLINE>

A HEALTH trust is threatening to take High Court action against a
couple unless they return a needle they claim was inside their baby when
he was discharged from hospital.
The parents say the one-and-a-half inch hypodermic needle emerged from
Benjamin Jones's back a week after his discharge from Treliske Hospital,
Truro, on January 12.
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust wants the needle back to aid an
independent investigation and has told the couple's legal representative
it is prepared to go to court to get it.
Benjamin's father, Royal Navy Lieutenant Steve Jones, 31, of Helston,
Cornwall, said: ''I thought it was a joke. They are adding insult to
injury.''
He said he and his wife, Andrea, 24, had not been able to settle to a
normal family life with Ben because of the needle incident.
Mr Adrian Hickman, a medical injuries specialist representing the
couple, said: ''The trust's solicitors have indicated that if the needle
is not delivered to the inquiry team by noon on Monday, they are
instructed to make application to the High Court for its return.''
The trust wanted the inquiry team to carry out tests on the needle,
including a forensic examination to see if there were any blood traces
for analysis, he said.
''We have not refused to release the needle, but we need to take
expert advice and consider the matter further,'' said Mr Hickman.
The needle was now in the hands of an independent expert who would
carry out a forensic examination for the family, he said.
Mr Hickman had been unable to instruct the expert formally, because
last week the Legal Aid Board refused a legal aid application he made on
the baby's behalf. An appeal against that decision is to be made in
Truro in a few days.
Trust spokesman Jan Honey said: ''The trust acted quickly to initiate
an independent investigation by external neo-natal experts. They are
unable to make further progress without the return of the needle.
''We have a duty to the public, and in the interests of baby
Benjamin's health, to ensure that this investigation is completed as
quickly and thoroughly as possible.''

They admitted that they had spent only a few hours at the site near

Barclay McBain, Education Correspondent, profiles the four candidates
who will face the final daunting test for leadership of the Educational
Institute of Scotland.
ON FRIDAY evening the council, the principal decision-making body of
the Educational Institute of Scotland, will elect a new general
secretary to succeed Jim Martin, who has joined life assurance society
Scottish Amicable.
There are four candidates for the post -- full-time EIS officials
Ronnie Smith and Ian McKay, and elected members George MacBride and Eric
Young. Job interviews can be daunting at the best of times and this is
one selection process which is definitely not for the faint-hearted.
There were initially 16 candidates for the job of leading, organising,
and managing Scotland's fifth biggest trade union. A long leet with nine
names was reduced to a short leet containing four last Friday night.
Each candidate will appear before the council, which has about 140
members who represent each EIS local association, or branch. Each
hopeful will make an opening statement. Council members will then be
given the opportunity to question the candidate before he is asked to
make a closing statement. The ordeal -- or opportunity, depending on
your outlook -- will last about 30 minutes for each interviewee.
Then the council moves to the vote. Voting continues until one
candidate secures an overall majority. Each time the vote is taken
without an overall winner the bottom candidate drops out.
And the prize for the winner? A salary of about #48,000 to run a union
with a healthy bank balance, membership income of more than #3m, and a
membership which has increased by 15% to nearly 49,000 teachers in
nursery, primary, secondary, further, and higher education.
And, if the general secretary is content to stay in post, he can sleep
easy in the knowledge that he will not have to go through the experience
again. The EIS was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria, which
means it is exempt from the Government legislation requiring trade-union
leaders to stand for re-election at regular intervals.
George MacBride
THE popular convener of the EIS education committee is principal
teacher of learning support at Govan High, Glasgow. Aged 48, with a wife
and two children, he was born in Glasgow but brought up in Fort William.
A graduate in English of Glasgow University, he joined the institute
when he started teaching and became involved in union activities at
school level as EIS rep. He spends about 30% of his working time on EIS
business.
As convener of the key education committee, he is credited with having
given the EIS a cutting edge in the field of education policy. He has
not allowed that policy to be driven by issues concerning teachers'
conditions of service. Under his convenorship educational matters have
been assessed on their merits and argued for or against from an EIS
perspective on education, rather than on dogmatic grounds. A stout and
articulate defender of comprehensive education, he is highly regarded in
the education world. He is respected in the key curriculum body, the
SCCC, and at ministerial level. He is regarded as an intellectual, and
there was surprise in some EIS circles at his decision to apply for the
post.
Ian McKay
* A 40-year-old from West Lothian, he has been a full-time official of
the EIS since 1988. A graduate in Education and English Studies of
Stirling University, he was active in student politics, having been
president of the students' union and then rector of the university.
Before becoming an EIS assistant secretary he taught in the further
education sector, at Stevenson College in Edinburgh. He was involved at
regional level in the College Lecturers' Association of the EIS.
Married with two children, he is regarded as being very able and a
good administrator. He will bring a political perspective to the EIS if
he secures the post. He has a profile in the STUC and is aware of the
central role the institute plays in the Scot tish trade-union movement.
His job is to service the EIS executive and he works with Ronnie Smith
on salaries, although like George MacBride he lacks experience of pay or
conditions negotiations at national level. He has a forthright manner
and has a reputation for not suffering fools. Of all the candidates, he
is widely seen as being an earnest advocate of the most radical policies
in the EIS leadership.
Ronnie Smith
* A FORMER principal teacher of Latin and Modern Studies in Broxburn
Academy, West Lothian, he also became a full-time assistant secretary of
the EIS in 1988. He is a 43-year-old Shetlander with a degree in Latin
and Economic History from Aberdeen University. He has a wife and two
children and did a lot for the EIS in an elected capacity before moving
to headquarters.
He is very much a backroom boy, working away assiduously on pay,
conditions, and legal cases and matters. His attention to detail is
legendary. His strength is taking the long view. He is steady, not
easily panicked, and has a great respect for the institute. He is highly
regarded among trade-union officials outside the EIS, and worked for
four years with his opposite number on the local authority management
side to replace fragmented agreements with a single, coherent conditions
of service document for teachers. An honest, modest, and deep man, he
has a reputation for being slow at promoting himself. His biggest
drawback is not pushing his own personality and, if elected, he will
probably not relish such public duties as giving the keynote address at
the institute's annual general meeting.
Eric Young
* A NATIVE of Greenock and graduate in English of Strathclyde
University in Glasgow, he is assistant principal teacher of English at
Johnstone High in Renfrewshire. Early on in his involvement with the
institute he decided to concentrate on EIS work rather than seek further
promotion in teaching. A 45-year-old with a wife and son, his many
responsibilities at local and national level mean that he works almost
full time for the EIS. He is the younger brother of The Herald's
economics editor, Alf Young.
He is widely seen as the most able of the new breed of elected members
to take on leadership roles in the EIS. A likeable, articulate man, he
made few enemies when he successfully steered through parhaps the most
contentious proposals in the EIS in the last seven or eight years. The
biggest shake-up in the union's history will result in decision-making
being streamlined and more power being devolved to local offices. With
assistant secretary Simon Macaulay, he worked very hard on the
proposals. His presentation of the case for change was said to be
excellent. He is comfortable with the media, although he has no
experience of running an organisation and has no great experience in the
trade-union movement outside the EIS.

'Everything about the objects of Emily sounds highly commendable. And
nobody in
Scotland wants anything to do with it'
Armed with her little list, 'Emily' will today
barge into a man's world at London's
Cafe Royal when the lobby group that
aims to help more Labour women
become MPs holds its first annual
awards ceremony. Julia Langdon meets
the mover and shaker behind 'Emily' and
Joe Donnelly talks to one of Scotland's
leading campaigners on the issue

1992 General Election in UK

Labour women MPs elected........................37
--------------------------------------------------
HERE is a puzzle: In 1945 three women Labour MPs were elected to
Parliament in Scotland. In the General Election of 1992, the number of
women elected was exactly the same -- but the proportion of women in
Labour-held seats in Scotland was in fact considerably worse. In the
past 50 years, then, there has been no significant advance either for
egalitarian politics or socialism or, really, for feminism -- despite
Scotland's supposed reputation for radical politics.
And yet here, on the other hand, is Barbara Follett: committed
feminist, and founder and fixer of an organisation established with the
sole aim of getting more Labour women into the House of Commons, and she
is bewailing the fact that no-one in Scotland is remotely interested in
the help she has to offer.
Most people who are active in Labour politics in Scotland would know
why this is. They would look at Barbara Follett -- snappy clothes,
bandbox smart, millionaire husband, Chelsea house -- and they would see
that there is a conflict here that is perhaps hard to reconcile on a wet
Friday evening canvassing for council votes in Drumchapel. This conflict
may be enhanced by reading in a recent magazine profile that the
Folletts spend one week in every month on the Cote d'Azur.
Could this be the true nature of the conflict between what we have
only just learned to call ''old Labour'' and ''new Labour'' and is it
not really much more relevant, in many ways, than the somewhat
theoretical debate about Clause Four? For what we are dealing with here
is the reality of what ''new Labour'' means, the question of whether it
can ever be accepted and thus whether it can work.
There are a number of conflicting issues: so Barbara Follett does live
on Cheyne Walk and indirectly channels some of the resources from the
hugely successful novels of her supportive husband Ken Follett into her
own personal political interests -- which, incidentally, he happens to
share. So what? Isn't the absence of millionaire backers prepared to
bankroll their political concerns something about which the Labour Party
has been lamenting for years? Is she not the woman who used to advise
Labour MPs and by-election candidates on how to dress on platforms and
what to wear on telly and how to appear stylish? Didn't she even,
inadvertently, invent a verb: to follett? ''Old'' Labour may sneer at
this and deride the need for colour-coded politics, and recall the
privations of the Dundee jute workers, but really wasn't it something
that was long overdue: updating the image for today while still lauding
the achievements and the sacrifices of those who showed us the way
yesterday? Should we not all try to appear at our best? Would not many
of us benefit from such help and advice?
One left-wing Scottish MP -- and not anybody famous, either -- told me
that it had helped him a great deal. Most would not be prepared to admit
as much in public.
And then what about Mrs Follett herself and all those military red
jackets with brass buttons that she always seems to wear, and all the
photo opportunities and the hype about her various politically correct
projects -- with her other hand she is writing a book, or, rather ''A
Status Report'' on ''The British Woman'' -- and all her smart, powerful,
achieving friends. Isn't she just a bit too good to be true? In it for
herself, maybe?
Yet how many political activists are there who were active in politics
in South Africa and whose husband, albeit estranged by then, was
assassinated in front of their two daughters and who even now recalls
the smell of his blood in their hair?
Now, the facts: Barbara Follett founded Emily's List UK two years ago
this month on the 75th anniversary of women first getting the vote in
parliamentary elections in 1918. It was based on a successful American
prototype, its aim to promote women candidates for Parliament. Emily is
an acronym for Early Money Is Like Yeast and whatever you may think of
that, it has nevertheless raised 30,000 in each of the past two years
and has so far adopted 11 women for sponsorship as parliamentary
candidates.
The money is used to train the women and to help meet their expenses
-- for child care and clothes and travel -- in seeking selection. A
second XI will be chosen soon and meanwhile the second anniversary of
the founding of the group is to be marked by a smart dinner at London's
Cafe Royal tonight at which Emily awards will be announced to honour
those who have contributed to the advancement of women in politics in
the past two years. There is, incidentally, to be one Emily award for
the ''Emily Man'' for which all three nominations on the short list are
Scots: Gordon Brown, the newly knighted Sir Gavin Laird, and the late
John Smith.
Everything about the objects of Emily sounds highly commendable. And
nobody in Scotland wants anything to do with it. When applications were
invited from women for sponsorship there was not a single request from
Scotland. Those women chosen for the first XI were picked to represent a
range of political, regional, and social interests -- but there was
nobody from Scotland.
''If there's one area in which I feel I have failed, it's in
Scotland,'' says Barbara Follett. We meet in the basement of the house
in Chelsea. It is, in principle, Ken's office, but there is also an
Emily office and a conference room, secretaries and staff, and computers
and order. Coffee arrives on cue. Copies of anything I seek are
instantly produced. The filing system is clearly something that humbles
most of us. Everything is clean, white, humming efficiency; minimal
distractions, maximum effectiveness: a sense that this is how one should
organise one's life if one wants to get on.
It all seems -- indeed, it all is -- light years away from anything on
any premises on which I have previously seen any Labour Party business
done. Perhaps that is part of the problem. To adapt an old joke, perhaps
she is arguing from the wrong premises. But we are being businesslike
here and not telling jokes.
''The Scottish women in the Labour Party are very organised. But they
have rejected all the overtures from Emily's List,'' she says. ''It's a
gross misunderstanding. They say it's a fast-track for middle-class
southern women. They look at the list of the women who are backing it
and for some reason they assume that those are the women we want to put
into Parliament.''
She acknowledges that the women honorary advisers on the
organisation's writing paper are, loosely, ''new Labour'' -- but their
names are there, all these fashionable socialist lefties, Helena Kennedy
and Glenys Kinnock and Claire Rayner, only to help raise the cash, she
says. And that should be Cash with a capital ''C'', for it is one of
Emily's four primary concerns; the others are the Culture of the Labour
Party, Confidence and Children. All of which, in one way or another, are
relevant to the circumstances of most women seeking election to
anything.
But if you discuss any of this with most leading figures in the Labour
Party in Scotland they will look at you with withering, pitying scorn.
The name of the organisation doesn't help, the fact that many leading
women in the party in Scotland are left-wing and consequently sceptical
of any kind of organisation of this nature is a further problem. But
there is something about Emily which does show a lack of understanding
of that Labour Party culture and all that it means in Scotland.
Barbara Follett admits that as the organisation was started in the
south of England there is a suspicion about it which she believes she
understands. I do not think that she does. She is direct and does not
pull her punches. She knows that she herself is part of the ''problem''
in Scotland, whatever it is.
''This isn't about promoting me,'' she protests. ''They think I have
done all this so I can get myself into Parliament.''
She does want to get into Parliament as it happens -- and that, of
course, doesn't help an easy analysis either. But her own ambitions are
irrelevant. However you look at it, she must be right when she says that
something is drastically wrong if the number of women elected in
Scotland has not increased in 50 years -- and although there are now
four Labour women since Helen Liddell's election to succeed John Smith,
the proportion of women in Labour seats has not improved.
She has deduced -- quite correctly, I gather -- that any woman who
sought a constituency selection in Scotland declaring herself as a
candidate supported by Emily's List would be shackling herself with an
unnecessary handicap.'' I'm quite sad about this,'' says Barbara
Follett. She knows that there must be women in Scotland who want and
need the help that Emily could provide but who are precluded from
seeking it.
And it will only be if Labour women in Scotland prove that they can
improve their own representation that Barbara Follett will be proved
wrong. So far their record is not an impressive one. But it will be
interesting, too, to watch what happens if and when Mrs Follett makes it
to Westminster herself. Will she still be holding out a hand to help
others?

ENGLAND captain Will Carling is unlikely to be censured by the English
Rugby Union -- despite a threat by French Federation president Bernard
Lapasset to report him for deliberate foul play during Saturday's Five
Nations clash at Twickenham.
Carling was involved in the thirty-seventh minute incident which saw
French full-back Jean-Luc Sadourny carried off with a knee injury that
later required 12 stitches as England romped home 31-10, their eighth
successive win over France.
''It's clear that if the act is reprehensible we shall adopt the same
procedures as the Welsh did over Olivier Merle,'' said Lapasset, the
future International Board president.
Lock Merle was dropped by France following a protest made by the Welsh
Rugby Union over a head-butt on Wales prop Ricky Evans during last
month's Five Nations opener in Paris.
In spite of early territorial advantage, England fell behind to an
eighteenth minute penalty from Thierry Lacroix when Brian Moore was
penalised.
Rob Andrew equalised after 19 minutes and added a second goal after 25
minutes.
With England's pack applying ever-increasing pressure, France conceded
a classic try to Guscott in the thirty-third minute. From a ruck on the
French line, scrum-half Kyran Bracken found the centre, who dummied both
French centres to score under the posts, Andrew converting.
England led 13-3 at the break and should have increased their lead
nine minutes later, only for Andrew's penalty attempt to rebound off a
post.
From the rebound, France swept upfield to score a typical
counter-attacking try. Right wing Philippe Bernat-Salles broke along the
right and full-back Mike Catt could only push his kick behind him for
the French wing to regain the ball. He quickly switched to scrum-half
Guy Accoceberry and the ball was worked to replacement full-back
Sebastian Viars to go over in the left corner.
It was only a temporary setback for England, with Andrew popping over
another three penalties after 50, 58 and 67 minutes
Two tries in the final eight minutes from Tony Underwood sealed the
result. He first raced on to a superbly-judged crosskick from Andrew
behind the goal line, beating the French captain Philippe Saint-Andre to
the touch, as he came up behind to reach the bouncing ball.
Then full back Mike Catt, having made an incisive break on the same
wing, slipped a pass outside to the Leicester wing, who raced over,
Andrew's conversion bringing his tally to 16.

' I don't want to see a single currency, period, for as far as I can
possibly foresee. I would hesitate for an eternity before I came out and
said I would vote for a single currency '
Jonathan Aitken
JOHN Major was last night watching his pattern for uniting his party
on Europe unravelling at the seams as Tory heavyweights disagreed on the
way ahead.
Senior figures from both wings of the party went public to set out
their vision for the future -- and heaped confusion on claims of unity
that looked increasingly fragile.
Labour accused the Government of ''going round in circles'' and
demanded a General Election before the crucial summit next year on the
future of Europe.
Tory officials believed they had hit on a winning formula when the
Prime Minister on Friday ruled out a single currency in 1997, but left
the door open to join in 1999.
They were convinced that a call by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke for
tighter economic conditions for a single currency would allow the party
to bury the hatchet on Europe and rally around one policy.
But the plan was blown out of the water yesterday when Treasury Chief
Secretary Jonathan Aitken -- a key player in any move to monetary union
-- set his face against a single currency for decades to come.
Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, weighed in with
a warning against the country wrapping itself ''in a national flag'' and
taking the risk of driving away business and jobs.
Euro-commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said there was ''no realistic
probability'' of persuading other EU countries to accept new conditions
for a single currency, and demanded an end to negative squabbling on
Europe.
''There may be a conflict between a short-term political objective of
trying to head off the difficulties caused by the lack of a
parliamentary majority and the long-term objective of securing what
Britain needs in Europe.''
Mr Aitken, a leading Cabinet Euro-sceptic, risked infuriating the
Prime Minister by taking an open stand against the carefully balanced
formula on a single currency.
''I don't want to see a single currency, period, for as far as I can
possibly foresee. I would hesitate for an eternity before I came out and
said I would vote for a single currency,'' he said on GMTV's Sunday
programme.
Mr Heseltine spoke of the dangers of Britain turning its back on a
single currency, and warned that he would not ''pander to the whim'' of
anti-European public opinion.
It was the ''first national priority'' to stop overseas investors,
worried that Britain was losing its commitment to Europe, taking their
money and jobs elsewhere.
In an article in the Sunday Times, he said the Government must dismiss
the ''politics of frustration and nostalgia''.
He added: ''How else do you advance negotiations? There is another way
-- wrap yourself in the national flag and give not an inch.''
Initial signs that the Prime Minister's new strategy was working --
with enthusiastic noises from longstanding critics on Europe -- were
swamped by the bickering over its details.
Sir George Gardiner, a senior right-wing back bencher, accused Mr
Heseltine of being ''at variance with the traditional British policy of
seeking a community of nation states''.
Fellow Euro-sceptic James Cran said it was pointless to pretend the
leadership could lead the party in a direction in which it did not want
to go.
''We must wait and see whether the ideology which Michael has (quite
rightly from his point of view) is counter-balanced by the political
views which he takes about the need to have a Conservative government
rather than a Labour government,'' he said.

Roy Rogers, Industrial Correspondent, examines fears that safety
standards will be one of the first casualties of rail privatisation.
ON THE evening of October 7, 1952, the City of Glasgow steam
locomotive pulled out of Perth to haul 11 carriages, including four
sleeping cars, to London-Euston. At precisely 18[1/2] minutes past eight
the following foggy morning it ploughed into a stationary local train at
Harrow and Wealdstone station just north-west of London and within
seconds was itself hit by the London to Liverpool express. One hundred
and twelve were killed and 157 seriously injured in Britain's
second-worst rail accident after the Quintinshill disaster at Gretna 37
years earlier in which 227 were killed.
Accidents on such a scale appear to have been eradicated but there has
still been a fairly steady stream of fatal accidents, the latest of
which were at Cowden in Kent last October, when five were killed, and
the Cumbria crash last Tuesday evening which killed one person and
injured 26.
The Cowden and Cumbria crashes, which are still the subject of
inquiries, and other scares, including faults to a Springburn to
Milngavie rush-hour commuter service, have done little to placate those
who fear that safety will suffer as rail privatisation progresses.
Not surprisingly, most concern is being expressed by the rail unions,
which came into existence mainly as a result of escalating fears over
safety in the boom years of the second half of the nineteenth century.
Their members are clearly the most vulnerable and often bear the brunt
of accidents or, as in the case of the driver of the train that crashed
at Purley in 1989, the blame. Locoman Robert Morgan was jailed for
missing a signal.
They have long been critical of British Rail and the Government for
being reluctant to address safety issues until there is a major accident
like the Harrow and Wealdstone disaster of 1952. Caused by a train
running through a danger signal, that crash ushered in the widespread
use of automatic warning systems which inform a driver when a red signal
has been passed.
The next big breakthrough came as a result of the Clapham disaster in
December 1988 in which 35 people died, and 500 were injured, 69 of them
seriously.
This jolted the industry out of its complacency; consultants were
brought in and a safety regime which had been limited to ''rules and
regulations'' gave way to a proper safety culture, the results of which
are only really now starting to be felt.
But with the fragmentation of BR into dozens of separate, often
competing, entities the unions fear that the safety culture itself will
be a casualty with all concerned eager to apportion blame elsewhere.
They already claim it is starting to be ''whittled away''.
Delay over the implementation of key recommendations of the Clapham
report -- especially on the introduction of automatic train-protection
equipment -- and the continued use of single-lead junctions and track
which has now been involved in four major accidents in as many years,
Cowden being the latest, leave the rail unions apprehensive.
Together with continuing doubts as to the safety of signalling
services operated by managers and supervisors during last year's signal
staff dispute and continuing delays in the introduction of new and much
safer rolling stock, they would appear to have strong cause for concern.
Although some 2500 ancient carriages -- many more than 30 years and
some more than 40 years old -- need replacing, uncertainty over the
privatisation programme is causing delay. Already an anticipated #150m
order for new Networker trains for the Kent coast routes has beeen
shelved and could result in the closure of York's historic carriage
works and the loss of 750 jobs.
The 37-year-old rolling stock concerned is to have its life extended
by up to a further five years.
BR is still managing to hold the safety culture together but what
happens when BR starts winding up? Significantly, a special safety
conference recently was hosted not by Railtrack, which has
responsibility for safety, but by BR itself.
Apparently Railtrack was swift to declare it could not be held
responsible for the infamous ''leaves on the line'' (which are, in fact,
a real danger in that adhesion, and therefore braking capability, are
affected) as not all the trees responsible were on Railtrack property.
Train operating companies -- there are 25 -- were advised to look into
retraining staff and reducing train speeds where necessary.
Therefore even before the industry is invaded by people with no
railway experience and no safety culture there are signs of a ''don't
blame me, blame him'' philosophy.
The scope for conflict between various parts of the railway was
demonstrated in the report into the Newton crash in 1991 in which four
people were killed. At that time BR was split into just five operating
units -- not the 80 or so in existence today -- yet clear divisions
between InterCity and Regional Railways led to ''absolute minimum
standards applied everywhere'' and had ''proved a hindrance to crash
recovery work''.
The report mentions a conversation between two senior railway managers
at the crash site who were aguing about whether the disaster belonged to
ScotRail or InterCity.
Labour MPs and even leading lights on the rail inspectorate have
expressed grave concerns over what might stem from ''amateurs'' taking
over the running of the railways.
But it is Railtrack's insistence that regardless of what Sir Anthony
Hidden recommended in his Clapham report it would be far too expensive
and not cost-effective to invest #600m in ATP technology as this would
equate to #14m for each life saved that is generating most concern.
The unions maintain that five out of six recent rail accidents in
which 48 people died and more than 1000 were injured would have been
prevented had ATP -- which overrides drivers should they speed or pass a
signal at danger -- been in operation.
In evidence to the Cowden inquiry, which has yet to report, the
locomen's union Aslef described ATP as ''the single most important
development to pursue'' and urged Major Kit Holden, assistant chief
inspecting officer of railways, to press the Government to demand and
finance the introduction of an ATP system covering the busiest 30% of
the rail network and thereby some 80% of passenger miles.
The unions also want radiophones and data-recording equipment in every
loco and strongly urged the inquiry to recommend the complete removal of
single-line operations on the Kent coast services.
Pointing out that over the past five years there have been collisions
at four locations, including Bellgrove, where doubled lines or junctions
have been singled, Aslef says it ''cannot conceive of a more blatant
example of safety being subjugated to commercial considerations''.
But Mr James Watson, counsel for BR, denied that those who managed the
system were responsible for a ''knowing and deliberate cost-driven
failure to make effective safety provision''.
He said: ''To say they in some way BR regard loss of life of drivers
and passengers to be 'affordable and acceptable' is both irresponsible
and untrue.''
Railtrack putting trust in its twin-track approach
* RAILTRACK, which is now responsible for rail infrastructure and
safety, remains remarkably upbeat, maintaining that the upheaval caused
by privatisation will actually improve safety.
Director of safety and standards Mr David Rayner confirms that
Railtrack is endorsing BR's view that the introduction of ATP would be
too costly and that more efficient and cost-effective methods of
tightening up safety are available.
He argues the rail industry's safety profile is ''pretty good'' and
that improvements over the years mean the railways now operate well
within Health and Safety Commission criteria.
The chances of an accident affecting a passenger who, like the average
commuter, makes two journeys a day were down to one in 100,000.
Mr Rayner said he understood people's fears over safety but maintained
that they were misplaced as the industry's new safety regime requires
Railtrack to be very careful before accepting safety cases, especially
from new operators.
''My belief is we actually have a stronger safety regime today than
under BR,'' he said, adding that train-operating companies would not be
allowed to go ahead without a sound safety case.
Following extensive trials of ATP on the Great Western and Chiltern
lines, Railtrack could not justify the cost of introducing the system
throughout the network, which at some #600m would represent about #14m
per life saved compared with the official Department of Transport
calculation of a life being worth #700,000.
Even if only the busier parts of the system were covered the cost per
life saved could not be reduced to anywhere near where it might be
deemed cost-effective, especially as SPAD -- ''signals passed at
danger'' -- accidents represented only about a quarter of all
significant accidents.
Railtrack was, therefore, adopting a twin-track approach to improving
safety by way of updating the existing AWS system at places like
single-lead junctions, such as Newton, which had been identified as
higher-risk areas while developing a hi-tech, on-board, radio-based
signalling system in the longer term.
At Newton and other higher-risk areas additional signals were being
installed together with detonators to alert drivers who pass the first
red light.
The new on-board satellite radio signalling system would be better and
cheaper than ATP. It was already in use in Japan and was being
stipulated for the #600m to #1 billion redevelopment of the West Coast
main line where it would make all track-side signals redundant.
Instead, signals would come up on the drivers' dashboard and drivers
who ignore them could be overridden. It would ensure greater safety and
allow better control, and therefore a higher frequency of services than
the current static system.

SCOTLAND'S 1995 victory over Ireland will be forever Gavin's. It was
the big man's day, his record-breaking fifty-third cap, his achievement
in becoming the first European player to top 500 points in
internationals, his silencing of even his most strident critics.
It began when coach Douglas Morgan handed him his jersey, a moment
which had both of them on the edge of tears, and continued with a
telegram from his first Scotland captain, Colin Deans. Hastings kicked
16 points, inspired his team to bounce back from the brink of disaster,
set up the try for Craig Joiner, then lay in the bath and drank a bottle
of beer, savouring every moment.
The finale was his speech to the post-match dinner, when he was
concerned most of all to commiserate with the Irish. ''You will soon be
winning again -- you have a great bunch of guys in the squad,'' he
declared.
Then, turning to Ireland's captain, Michael Bradley, who, at 32, is
probably also in his last Five Nations' Championship, Gavin promised:
''We will have a great game next year, Mickey, only it will be over
Portmarnock golf course.''
Bradley was philosophical in defeat. ''Two Scottish wins represents a
streak, two Irish losses is a blip.'' Will the game be as much fun as
this if the money talks, one wonders?
Others queued up to pay tribute to the main man. Flanker Iain Morrison
has known him since their Cambridge University days. ''There is no-one
quite like Gavin, and I want to scream when people say he is over the
hill. Ask anyone in this team and they will tell you what he is worth.
He has just told us that we are going to beat France in Paris -- what's
more, he believes it.''
Indeed, winning in Paris is the only absent credential on Gavin's
report card and he is mightily determined to do it in his final year.
Then beating Wales and going to Twickenham to bid for a Grand Slam --
can you believe it? No, neither can I just yet, but Mr Hastings has a
way of converting more than penalty goals.
Douglas Morgan said: ''Gavin is a modest, honest man. We have played a
mainly young side and he has done more than anyone else to make them
believe the game plan would work.''
The youngest of the side, Craig ''Jacky'' Joiner, just 20, spoke of
his debt to the skipper. ''I was at primary school when Gavin won his
first cap, though he may not want to be reminded of that. He is
enormously helpful to the younger players, encouraging them to keep it
simple.
''My try was made by his kick. I thought Kenny Logan was going to
score it, but when he kicked on I just sprinted for the ball. It was a
wonderful moment, my first try in the Five Nations and my first at any
level for quite while.''
I thought Logan had been taken out by Simon Geoghegan and that
Scotland might have had a penalty try. Referee Derek Bevan did not see
it that way. ''If an Irishman had beaten Joiner to the touch I would
have given a twenty-two,'' he told me.
Scotland's other try-scorer was the amazing Damian Cronin, bagging his
second in two matches. He first took the ball at the lineout, then
ordered the pack to ''walk it over.''
The Nae Luck Trophy, previously held by the Welsh touch judge who had
his nose broken by a TV cameraman in the Canadian game, was transferred
to Irish president Ken Reid. He missed the match because of flu, settled
down to watch it on the box when the fire alarm went off in his hotel,
and he found himself out on the street in his dressing-gown!
SRU president Ken Smith presented Gavin with a decanter. It was the
end of a perfect day.

<HEADLINE>Hearing will judge whether Mrs West should stand trial</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979992753</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE start of committal proceedings against Mrs Rosemary West will get
under way in Dursley, Gloucestershire, today.
The hearing is to determine whether the mother-of-seven will stand
trial at Crown Court.
Mrs West is accused of 10 murders, including those of her daughter,
Heather, 16, and eight-year-old step-daughter Charmaine. Her husband,
similarly charged, was found hanged in prison at New Year.
The remains of nine of their alleged victims were recovered in a
police dig last year at her house and garden at 25 Cromwell Street, in
Gloucester.
The murder charges cover a 16-year period to 1987.
She also is charged, jointly with named men, with two separate counts
of rape involving one girl, and of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
The Dursley Courthouse will be the focus of media attention for at
least a week.
Its small courtrooms have been refurbished at a cost of #17,000 to
cater for the hearing.
0 The court building was mothballed about two years ago as more and
more cases were being heard at a more modern premises in Stroud.
However, it was pressed into service for Mrs West's hearing to prevent
Stroud and Gloucester magistrates' courts being clogged up by the sudden
demands of international media attention.
Just over 50 people will be allowed in the main court room, where
Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Peter Badge will preside.
He faces the task of deciding whether the prosecution has established
that there is a case against Rosemary West which she should answer at a
Crown Court trial.
If Mrs West is committed, her trial is likely to be held at the Old
Bailey or at Winchester Crown Court in the autumn.
The Crown's legal team is headed by Mr Neil Butterfield QC, a leading
barrister on the Western Circuit, with junior Mr Andrew Chubb.
Junior London barrister Miss Sasha Wass will lead the defence case.
Legal aid rules mean her leader, Mr Richard Ferguson QC, will not be
present, although he has been supervising the case.
Miss Wass is being instructed by Gloucester-based solicitor Leo
Goatley, 39, who has repeatedly protested Mrs West's innocence.
Committal proceedings are covered by reporting restrictions and it
would be extremely unusual for these to be lifted. The restrictions mean
that the general public will know little of what happens inside the
court.
In an old-fashioned hearing such as this witnesses give evidence which
is written down as depositions.
In the Dursley hearing it is expected that much of the evidence will
be handed in a file to the examining magistrate, Mr Badge, and that only
a handful of witnesses will be called to give evidence and be
cross-examined.

For Victor, read Leon, super assassin. William Russell talks to Luc
Besson, whose new thriller starring Jean Reno revives the role Reno
played in the acclaimed Nikita.
LUC BESSON is short and plump. His cropped blond hair is fashionably
streaked and he knows that he looks good and could almost be the star of
one of his own flashy but empty, although very popular, thrillers like
Nikita or Subway, not to mention his windy philosophical tale about
dolphins, The Big Blue, all of which have been internationally popular.
His new film, Leon, stars the splendid Jean Reno, reviving a role he
played in Nikita, that of Victor, The Cleaner, a super professional
assassin who cleans up the mess left by other less professional killers.
Quentin Tarantino did Besson the honour of pinching the idea behind the
character for the role played by Harvey Keitel in Pulp Fiction who
cleans up the mess made by John Travolta when he blows somebody's brains
out by mistake in his car.
Nikita was such a success that Hollywood bought the rights and remade
it virtually frame by frame as The Assassin, a tribute Besson regards
with some scorn. Reinterpreting a script is one thing, copying it
wholesale another in his book. He admitted to having got a lot of money
for that, but with Leon, as Victor is now called, he has circumvented
the process. It is an English language film and the action is set in New
York.
''I started writing the film for Jean, but not as one for me to
direct,'' he said. ''He told me he had been so pleased with Victor that
he would like to make a movie as the character and I said -- OK, if I
have a month, I will write it for you. Then I had a month so I started
to write.
''The problem was I fell in love with the script and I called him. I
said the good news is I have found a good director for the film, but the
bad news is it is me. I was obliged to test to find the best actor for
the part. I said he was one of the best, but I had to see other people.
If at the end of the day he was the best, he would have it. He was sad,
but he knows me. In a way it is respect for him not to say I take you
because you are my friend. He was the best!''
The film is about how Leon, who has the emotional age of a 14 year
old, befriends Mathilda, a little girl much the same age who lives in
the flat next door after her family has been murdered by drug dealers.
It is a dazzling mixture of violence and charm as this unlikely couple
fall in love in the purest sense. One thing Besson was sure of -- there
were no other French actors who could have played Leon.
''If you compare with animals we have not so many actors who can play
lions physically, we have lots of those small Frenchy Parisian actors,''
he said. ''It is difficult to find a guy who is huge physically.''
On the choice of New York as the location for the film, he said it was
a question of finding the right city for what he had written. Nikita was
right for Paris, but not for Leon because it was impossible to be
anonymous in Paris. ''The building belongs to the concierge and she
knows everything,'' he said. ''In New York you can cross the street
naked at noon and nobody would care.'' Asked how he had signed up Gary
Oldman, who plays a drug-popping killer, he said it was ''by hazard''.
The pair met, went to a restaurant, and apparently fell in love at first
sight.
''We talked about the script and he said he thought the story was good
and started to play the role in the middle of the restaurant. We shook
hands at the end of the dinner and his agent called me the next day and
said he had heard Gary was making my movie. Was he?
''Sometimes you meet someone and you know it is going to be fine,
someone who likes the same things. It was very easy. He was like an
angel during the shooting.''
Besson admitted the film was violent but said it had not affected
Nathalie Portman who plays Mathilda. ''Most actors want to be actors to
forget themselves,'' he said. ''I was scared that I might find a young
girl in trouble in her head who would become involved in the part, but
she was very balanced. As soon as you said 'Cut' she played like every
kid. She did not care about the movie.''
He insisted that the relationship between Mathilda and Leon was pure.
''Nothing is sexual,'' he said. ''It is about love between two kids.
Some people say your movie is disgusting because you talk about sex. I
say where? It is not in my movie. They are both alone. He needs love and
so does she. I am not scared about their love. It is a good love.''
* Leon opens in Scotland on Friday.

TOXIC chemicals linked to male reproductive disorders could be finding
their way into Scotland's drinking water, the environmental group
Friends of the Earth has claimed.
A report for FoE by Dr Michael Warhurst warns that the chemicals --
alkyl phenol ethoxylates, or APEs -- which are used in industry as
detergents and as additives to some plastics, are ending up in rivers
across Britain.
The chemicals are said to have caused the feminisation of fish in
rivers and may be linked to falling sperm counts, testicular cancer, and
other male health problems, since when they degrade they create a
substance akin to the female hormone oestrogen.
FoE also claims that woollen mills may have used APEs to wash their
wool and discharged them into rivers.
An FoE spokesman said: ''No measurements of the levels of these
chemicals have been made in Scottish rivers. If the fish are
accumulating these compounds, those people who eat them will be exposed.
''There is particular concern over the potential effects on children
and the unborn since they naturally have very low levels of hormones in
their bodies.''
Dr Warhurst said: ''It is clear that these chemicals should have been
banned years ago. They are a remnant of 1950s environmental pollution
and their use should cease.''
The chief scientist at Clyde River Purification Board, Dr Andrew Haig,
said: ''At the moment we are not handling any monitoring of these
substances.''
The river purification board at present monitored only substances on
the so-called ''red list''.
''When the risks, or possible risks, of these substances have been
established by research we will certainly divert our analytical funding
from red-list monitoring to look at these other compounds,'' he said.
''We are not complacent. We are keeping a close watch on the
situation.''

<HEADLINE>Fears grow over skilled labour shortage in city</HEADLINE>

FEARS are growing that Glasgow will be unable to continue its success
in attracting companies to the city because the pool of available
skilled labour is drying up.
It is the ultimate irony for an area with one of Scotland's highest
travel-to-work unemployment rates, currently 9.5%.
However, direct action to overcome the threat is under way. Glasgow
Development Agency is determined that the city will continue to remain a
significant player in the ''call centre'' market, where thousands of
jobs have already been created or are in the pipeline.
Senior officials last night confirmed that a training programme was
being launched to ensure that Glasgow did not lose out, and could meet
all future recruitment demands of firms in the fast growing
communications-based industry.
In its first year alone, more than 1000 unemployed people will go
through crash courses designed to top up the labour pool capable of
meeting the job opportunities.
The courses will also ensure that the GDA cannot be accused of having
exaggerated the city's advantages during intensive behind-the-scenes
lobbying that won the relocations in the first place.
Many were gained, against stiff competition from as far afield as
Dublin and London, after the GDA had targeted firms. Its strong case for
inward investment was based not on financial incentives but on having an
available labour pool with the skills and expertise to move quickly into
the businesses.
However, it is understood some firms are now worried they might find
themselves in competition with each other for skilled staff -- and might
even be forced to improve wages, terms, and conditions which have tended
to be on a par with rivals.
Recent call centre announcements by the National Australian Group,
Abbey National Life, the TSB, BT, and the BBC, are worth almost 2000
jobs.
Similar ventures involving telephone sales or financial and insurances
services include British Airways, Mercury, Direct Line, and Britannia
Life, while several hundred jobs are destined for an Army and Pay
Personnel Centre relocated at Kentigern House.
Many of the jobs are of a similar nature, involving administration,
processing, clerical and secretarial duties -- or telephone-based
services in which substantial evidence exists that a Glasgow or West of
Scotland accent plays an important part in raising credibility with
customers.
Mr John McCann, the GDA inward investment executive leading the
campaign to attract call centres, denied there were any problems in
satisfying current demands for skilled labour from companies already
operating in the sector.
But the agency ''fully appreciates'' that if it is to attract even
more firms -- let alone meet likely expansion plans of those already
operating -- it must equip many more people with the necessary basic
skills to compete effectively for the jobs.
The crash courses, lasting six to eight weeks, will include a wide
range of skills, including communications, keyboard, telesales, and
presentation. Other elements embrace customer service and care,
confidence building, and social-interpersonal skills.
Training executive Denise Kerins acknowledged that it was inevitable
that a number of jobs in new call centres would be filled by people
already employed in the same field.
She said that would create vacancies, and added that the access
courses, funded through the GDA's training for work programme, would
ensure people were able to compete for jobs ''in any kind of call centre
environment''.

ALAN McManus will have nightmares after coming so close yesterday to
claiming the keys to a #45,000 Jaguar XJR at the Benson and Hedges
Masters. The title-holder had the Wembley Conference Centre crowd on the
edge of their seats during the sixth frame of his 5-3 second-round
victory over David Roe.
World No.6 McManus potted 13 reds and 13 blacks, and looked to have a
gilt-edged opportunity of recording the first maximum break of his
career. But with the run on 104, the Scot unluckily failed to achieve
position and potting the fourteenth red into a partially covered top
pocket using the rest was beyond him.
''It's the best chance of a 147 I've ever had,'' said McManus. ''I was
already thinking about picking the colour of the car. It's a real
sickener.''
Earlier, fellow-Scot John Higgins recovered from losing the opening
three frames to beat Malta's Tony Drago 5-3.
But when Drago, who like Higgins was making his Masters debut,
sprinted into a 3-0 lead after only 22 minutes play, there seemed to be
only one winner.
Drago compiled a 77 break in the first frame, an 89 in the third and a
132 total clearance in the second. He also had a golden opportunity to
snatch the fourth frame on the black after he had required two snookers
at one stage on the colours. Following a short safety exchange Higgins
sank the black for 1-3 and the momentum swung in his favour.

was beaten 6-5 by S Chong in the semi-finals.

THE scrapping of a military equipment watchdog department based in
Glasgow could cost the Ministry of Defence more money than it saves,
according to a document leaked to The Herald yesterday.
The document, circulated among senior MoD management, claims an audit
recommending the ''restructuring'' of the Assistant Directorate of
Standardisation -- the body which sets the rules for quality control --
had not considered the full financial and practical impact of the
proposal.
The 50-strong department is to be disbanded, and a smaller ''policy
cell'' established near Bristol. Defence Civil Service unions have
warned this could lead to shoddy standards in equipment manufacture and
maintenance, and endanger Servicemen's lives.
The executive summary admits that there are a number of operational
weaknesses in the department's existing structure; it also expresses
concern that recommendations made in 1989 and again in 1991 to tighten
control procedures have not been implemented.
It continues: ''We are concerned that the proposed restructuring plan
may not have a clear conception of how standardisation will be addressed
in future. It may also not have fully considered the implications of
fragmenting the process of producing or reviewing defence standards.
''The likely cost increases to other budget areas if they have to take
on work previously undertaken by the Assistant Directorate has not been
adequately considered. It is also highly doubtful whether changing the
way standardisation is addressed will produce net savings.''
The Defence Ministry sees future quality control being transferred
into the hands of industry, with some supervision from the
''down-sized'' policy cell. The unions involved and even some equipment
suppliers are doubtful whether such a self-regulating policy would work.
The standardisation department's dispersal is the subject of a union
inquiry into wasting of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money. The 50
jobs were part of a 200-post dispersal programme from England
implemented in the 1980s.
Most of these senior jobs are now being transferred back south with
little or no explanation in a direct reversal of that policy. Some of
the posts have been in Scotland for little more than five to 10 years.
At a time when the Defence Ministry is trying to slash #750m a year
from its budget, the relocation and other costs of moving staff will add
to expenditure.
Staff unions at Glasgow's Kentigern House, due to become the Army's
integrated pay, personnel, and records office from 1997, are awaiting a
consultation document which they expect will propose slashing hundreds
of jobs from the 700 promised two years ago.
Senior administrators are seeking a building somewhere in the city
centre to house 150 civil servants who will be temporarily decanted for
two years to make room for refurbishment of the custom-built Kentigern
complex.
It is understood that recent negotiations for a suitable site fell
through at the last minute, and that there is now pressure to find an
alternative to allow work to begin at the main office.

Sarajevo, Sunday
BOSNIA'S warring factions agreed to open roads across Sarajevo's
airport to civilians as the people of the besieged city marked the first
anniversary of a massacre that galvanised international will to
intensify peace efforts.
Muslims and Croats also agreed in Munich to appoint an international
mediator to strengthen their fragile confederation in Bosnia, a US
official said.
Commanders of the Muslim, Serb and Croat armies were due to meet
United Nations officials to discuss reinforcing a four-month ceasefire
that began on January 1.
The rivals were expected to discuss mapping of the front lines so that
UN peacekeepers could be deployed between them.
UN sources told Reuters that negotiators from the Muslim-led Bosnian
government and Serb forces besieging Sarajevo appeared to have resolved
differences which would allow two roads to open for civilian traffic
tomorrow.
The Serbs closed the roads to civilian traffic in July but had pledged
to reopen them under the latest truce pact.
They opened the roads to several UN aid agencies and the International
Committee of the Red Cross last week but have yet to allow commercial
traffic into Sarajevo, which relies on a humanitarian airlift for most
of its food supplies.
Citizens of Sarajevo thronged the market where 68 people died from the
impact of a mortar bomb in the worst single atrocity of the war.
The attack set in train peace initiatives which obliged Serbs, under
threat of Nato air strikes, to remove most of their tanks and siege guns
from around the city and after many months of mediation culminated in
the ceasefire.
Fighting is mainly confined to the northwestern Bihac pocket which
government troops are defending against rebel Muslims armed and aided by
Serbs.
Muslims and Serbs blamed each other for firing the fatal mortar bomb
and UN peacekeepers said their investigation was unable to determine
which side was responsible.
The parents of one victim laid a lone wreath at the Markale market but
no official ceremonies were held.--Reuter.

STEVE TONGUE on the football action from south of the Border
FIFA's refereeing clampdown, however erratically interpreted by
English officials, has made this a testing time of year for journalists.
How many synonyms is it possible to find for the words ''suspension''
and ''ban''?
With most teams having played around 30 league and cup matches, it
seems that just about every player that ever made a tackle has clocked
up enough disciplinary points to have earned at least one enforced
absence; others are already on their second; and players like Arsenal's
Ian Wright now have more points than their club.
Last week, Wright was banned for four matches and fined #1000 after
clocking up 41 points (Arsenal have a mere 33 in the Premiership),
causing manager George Graham to suggest a new evaluation of the system.
''I think the threshold for a first ban should be increased from 21
points,'' he said. ''There are around 50 players in the Premiership who
have passed that mark, because bookings are up about 60%.''
A cursory glance at the team news for the weekend matches confirmed
his point: mire than half the sides involved had at least one player
either starting a suspension or available again after having finished
one.
And all that was before another heated Saturday afternoon on which
four more players were sent off -- two of them, ironically, from
Arsenal.
Tony Adams' dismissal in the 3-1 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday
illustrated the growing gap between, on one side, the professionals and,
on the other, the referees who genuinely believe that they are doing
what they are supposed to do.
Adams believed that he had been the victim of a stray elbow and was
making the point to referee Keith Burge, graphically, by swinging his
arm. It happened to catch Wednesday's Mark Bright, who staggered back,
and off went Adams. Bright has offered to support him in any appeal.
John Hartson, Graham's #2.5m signing from Luton, an apparently
mild-mannered young man, followed later for a reckless challenge and,
so, there were two more bans for the beleagured Graham to contend with.
The two red cards overshadowed the return of Paul Merson, who started
a game for the first time since early November after six weeks of
rehabilitation from his drinking, gambling, and drugs problems.
Liverpool and Crystal Palace will also suffer suspensions after
players saw red. Phil Babb, the Republic of Ireland internationalist,
was dismissed in a 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest, where the visitors' 10
men equalised in the last minute. Ricky Newman, one of Palace's young
midfielders, went at Ipswich as his team held on for a 2-0 victory that
hoisted the Londoners into mid-table and heightened the predicament
facing the East Anglians.

President Ottavio Cinquanta of Italy said the matter would be discussed
before the next biennial congress of the organisation, in Jerusalem in

The suggestion was immediately welcomed by five-times European women's
champion Surya Bonaly of France. ''It is a good idea. In skating, a
career is short. We need the money now, not when we are 60,'' she said.

PRINCE Naseem Hamed, the young boxer from Sheffield who is already
European bantam and WBC International super bantam champion, could be
set for a cash bonanza in an all-British battle for the WBO
featherweight championship.
Unbeaten Hamed watched Steve Robinson of Wales make heavy weather of a
defence of his world featherweight title against Argentina's Domingo
Damigella in Cardiff on Saturday night, and said: ''Let's get it on.''
Promoter Frank Warren believes that a fight between quiet man Robinson
and the extrovert Hamed could overtake the landmarks set by the famous
Barry McGuigan-Eusebio Pedroza WBA featherweight contest at Loftus Road
in 1985 which captured a record television audience of 18.5m for a
boxing event in Britain. It also drew a gate of around 24,000.
''I'd be confident of winning a fight with Robinson. I've always been
confident, so that's nothing new,'' said Hamed.
Robinson countered: ''I'd be too strong for Naseem.''
The Welshman had a tougher job than expected in disposing of the
slippery and awkward Damigella in what was his sixth defence of the
title. Having been badly hurt in the opening round, the challenger
recovered to box quite skilfully on the retreat and frustrated Robinson
before going down by the judges' margins of 116-113 and 115-113 (twice).

STEPHEN Hendry moved into the quarter-final stage of the Benson and
Hedges Masters at Wembley last night.
The world snooker champion, seeking his fifth title of the season,
looked full of confidence during his 5-1 victory over Nigel Bond.
''I love playing here,'' said the Scot. ''The atmosphere is great and
I always put this tournament up with the UK and world championships on
my list of priorities.''
Bond made a 39 break in the first frame, but Hendry pounced with a
decisive 73 clearance to the pink which set the pattern.
Meanwhile, Alan McManus will have nightmares after having come close
to claiming the keys to a #45,000 Jaguar XJR at the event.
He had the audience on the edge of their seats during the sixth frame
of his 5-3 victory over David Roe.
McManus potted 13 reds and 13 blacks, and looked to have a great
chance of recording the first maximum break of his career. But with the

''It's the best chance of a 147 I've had,'' said McManus. ''I was

Another Scot, John Higgins, recovered from losing the opening three

DIVISIONS TWO AND THREE
THE unbeaten home records of the top two clubs in the second division
were ended on Saturday, with Berwick dropping two places to fourth
thnaks to a 2-1 defeat by Dumbarton. But the blow of losing 2-0 to
Stirling Albion may have more immediate consequences for Stenhousemuir.
They still lead the division, now by four points, but have lost what
had become an aura of invincibility. This was their first defeat on any
ground since October and, having already held St Johnstone at Perth,
they must have fancied their chances when the clubs meet again in the
cup tomorrow. Now the Saints will be a little less anxious about the
replay.
Stirling had keeper Mike Monaghan to thank for a string of saves. It
was against the run of play that Ian McInnes finished off a good move
after half an hour and substitute Willie Watters made the points safe.
For the second time this season, Dumbarton pulled off a comeback win
over Berwick. The Borderers' unbeaten home record looked safe when they
still led by Martin Neil's first half goal with 15 minutes left. Charlie
Gibson levelled matters and Jim Meechan stepped in with a last-minute
winner.
A Rowan Alexander header was enough to keep the points at home for
Morton against lowly Brechin, but a home defeat for East Fife dropped
them down a few places. John Cusack had volleyed them ahead early on but
Clyde hit back with an Ian Angus penalty, a goal from Martin O'Neill and
a header by Gordon Parks. Robert Scott maintained the Fifers' recent
record of self-inflicted wounds by being sent off.
Jim McQueen pulled off a string of saves against his old club as Queen
of the South won the relegation battle at Meadowbank.
Forfar still lead the third division after a 1-1 draw at Inverness.
David Bingham put them in front, but John Scott earned Caley Thistle a
point after the home side's Dave Brennan was sent off.
Ross County stayed second after a 1-1 draw at Montrose, where the home
side had a goal disallowed and missed a penalty, Innes McDonald the
offender. Both goals also came from spot kicks with Colin McGlashan
equalising Brian Grant's County score.
Danny Diver hit a hat trick against one of his former clubs, Arbroath,
in a 3-2 victory that took Alloa up to third. But Cowdenbeath lost
ground at Hampden where Ross Caven's goal for Queens Park was the only
score.

aimed at pushing, they said, Ecuadorean forces back into their country.
The armed conflict between the two countries is in its 11th day.

DIVISION ONE: By HUGH McKINLAY
DUNDEE got a ''Wee Flea'' in their ear in the 3-2 defeat from
Dunfermline at Dens Park -- and it didn't come from manager Jim Duffy.
Far from it. He praised them.
The reference to the mite who got under the first division leaders'
skin comes from the nickname of full back Derek Fleming. The Fifers'
very own ''Wee Flea'' not only scored his first goal after 19 games for
the club, but it came direct from a corner kick at that.
''The gaffer always encourages me to come forward, and also to take
in-swinging corner kicks from the right. But it was still a strange way
to get my first goal,'' he said afterwards.
It was the final straw for a brave Dundee side who had to fight for 80
minutes with only 10 men after keeper Michel Pageaud had been sent off
for bringing down Stewart Petrie. Fortunately for Pageaud and his club,
his goalkeeping usually is much better than his English. Roughly
translated, Pageaud reckoned afterwards he had got to the ball first.
Referee Ken Clark's red card spoke volumes for what he thought, and
substitute keeper Paul Mathers' first job was to get both hands twice to
Paul Smith's penalty kick. The first time he failed to stop it. The
second time was when he picked it out of the net.
Managers as a rule are difficult to please, so when the defeated Duffy
praised his men, and Bert Paton hit out at some of his below-Pars, there
were surreptitious checks of notes to confirm who had won what had been
a cracking match.
Duffy, whose men twice came back from being down through goals by Paul
Tosh and Gerry Britton, admitted individual mistakes had led to
Dunfermline's strikes by Smith again, and then Fleming. ''But when you
get 100% from your players, you cannot expect any more'' said Duffy.
''There were some quite incredible performances out there, Neil McCann
and Gerry Britton being cases in point.''
Over to Bert Paton: ''Of course, I'm pleased with the result. Everyone
in the league will be happy with it. But we can play much better than
that.''
Paton, of course, also was referring to the fact that his side, in
joint second place with Airdrie and Raith Rovers, now are only three
points off Dundee at the top.
Raith were another side who found an unhappy manager awaiting them in
the dressing room after their 2-1 win over Ayr United at Stark's Park --
a result that took their run to eight straight victories, seven in the
league.
''We're going ahead, and then still failing to kill off teams with a
second goal,'' said Jimmy Nicholl, whose injury meant he had to suffer
on the sidelines as his side's momentum ground to a halt.
Relegation-haunted Ayr certainly deserved their equaliser through
Vinnie Moore after manager Simon Stainrod had come off the bench to
direct play from the field. But he was livid when hesitation in front of
goal allowed Steve Crawford to hit the winner, adding to Davie
Sinclair's opener. The Ayr dressing room was another unhappy place
afterwards.
Airdrie manager Alex MacDonald, however, was quite content with his
side's 4-1 victory at Stranraer, a game which thankfully was nothing
like the sides' previous meeting at Broadwood, when four were sent off.
Alan Lawrence hit a superb double to add to strikes by Tony Smith and
Graham Hay.
It left Stranraer anchored at the foot of the table, a point adrift of
Ayr United and three behind a St Mirren side who cannot seem to make any
upwards progress. They visited Hamilton at Firhill, and goals by Gary
Clark and Peter Duffield -- his sixteenth of the season -- kept Accies
well out of the relegation fight, but again had St Mirren fans shouting
for the head of manager Jimmy Bone.
Clydebank are another side struggling to put three points on the
board, although at least they managed one against St Johnstone at
Kilbowie before having to face their Scottish Cup replay against Hearts
tomorrow.
The tired legs of Bankies, however, against a Saints side who just
could not put away their chances, does not bode well for success at
Tynecastle.

Gulf states met in Cairo yesterday to discuss security and nuclear
disarmament in a Middle East edging towards peace with Israel.
The ministers, from the countries which signed the Damascus
Declaration after the Gulf War in 1991, broke the Ramadan fast together
at the Egyptian foreign ministry and then sat down for a first formal
session of talks.

A SHORT leet of four candidates has been drawn up for the post of
general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, the
country's fifth biggest trade union.
The job carries a salary of #48,000 and the successful candidate will
be responsible for leading a union with nearly 49,000 members in
nursery, primary, secondary, further, and higher education.
The post became vacant when Mr Jim Martin, general secretary since
1988, announced in December he was leaving to take up a senior post with
Scottish Amicable.
The EIS executive initially selected 16 names from the list of
applicants and last Friday reached agreement on the four candidates to
go before the EIS council, the union's principal decision-making body
between its annual meetings.
They are full-time officials Mr Ronnie Smith and Mr Ian McKay, and
elected members Mr George MacBride and Mr Eric Young.

AN MP has called on the Government-funded Gaelic Television Committee
to explain the share dealing of one of its senior executives.
Mr Calum MacDonald, Labour MP for the Western Isles, said the Gaelic
quango, which has an annual budget of #8.7m, should make a full
statement on how its corporate affairs manager came to hold shares in
Scottish Television. The GTC is putting #2m a year into one of Scottish
Television's subsidiary companies.
The subsidiary, Scottish Television Enterprises, makes Gaelic
programmes which are then shown on Scottish and Grampian.
The potential conflict of interest arose after Mr Alasdair MacKay, GTC
corporate affairs manager, bought 700 shares in Scottish Television at
#4.25 each in December.
Mr MacKay, who is responsible for contracts on specific productions,
said that when he bought the shares in December he had had no business
dealings with Scottish Television.
He himself had brought up the issue of his shareholding at a meeting
of the Stornoway-based GTC on January 10 because he ''sensed'' there
could be a conflict of interest. ''We were going into negotiations with
STE at a later date and I was going to become involved in these business
dealings.''
Mr MacKay said he had bought the shares because he had his own
theories on how they would perform. ''However the share price went down
so that doesn't say much for my inclinations.''
Having been told of the potential conflict of interest the GTC
director, Mr John Angus MacKay, who is no relation, immediately advised
Mr MacKay to sell the shares which he did for #4.18 each, a loss of 7p
on each share.
Mr John MacKay went on to defend his namesake. He said: ''Alasdair
dabbles in shares all the time. In December he thought that Scottish
Television was going to be bought over.
''He wasn't involved in the dealings we had with Scottish Television
at the time. When it came up on January 10 I advised him to get rid of
them in case of any conflict of interest. That was it as far as we were
concerned.''
Mr MacDonald said: ''It appears there has been a conflict of interest
here and the GTC must ensure it never happens again.
''The GTC should make a full statement.''

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
By MICHAEL GRANT
IVAN Golac may be this country's most cosmopolitan football manager,
but his file on Huntly can hardly be the thickest of volumes.
Victory in a Scottish Cup replay with Clyde tomorrow night will pack
United off to Christie Park. Lying in wait will be a tight park, an
intimidating crowd, and Scotland's top non-league side. Accordingly,
Kenny Cameron and Bruce Martin were dispatched from the Tannadice
backroom team to see Huntly's 4-1 demolition of Keith.
Brian Thomson (2), Martin Stewart and Gary Whyte all netted to leave
the United contingent with plenty to report. For Huntly, it was merely
business as usual as they opened their defence of the Aberdeenshire Cup.
Cove, still reeling from an alleged attack on a referee by former
skipper Dave Morland, ended the week in more agreeable fashion with a
1-0 win at Peterhead thanks to Scott Buchan's goal.
Fraserburgh's Mike Stephen was red-carded against Deveronvale, but the
10 men still won through with goals from Scott Clark and Jim Geddes.
In the North Cup, Clach defender Gavin Dearie got his first goal in
eight years in their 2-2 draw at Lossiemouth. Philip Lamb also was on
target, while Iain Stewart hit a double to earn Lossiemouth a replay.
An Ian McDougall hat trick helped Brora Rangers brush aside Rothes
4-0, while highly-fancied youngster Andy Matheson broke Wick's hearts
with the only goal four minutes from time to blast Forres into the
semi-finals.
In the only first round replay, Caley Thistle's second team won 4-2
against keen rivals Elgin City. Alan Hercher hit a double with veteran
Billy Urquhart also on the mark alongside youngster David Buchanan.
In the only Highland League game, Fort William notched their fourth
consecutive win when they beat Nairn County 2-0.

THREE Scottish back bench Tory MPs have combined to put forward a
strong message about the positive stance the party must take in the
build-up to the next General Election and what it must do to win.
Mr George Kynoch (Kincardine and Deeside) and Mr Raymond Robertson
(Aberdeen South) have set out their positions in letters to their
respective constituency chairmen while Mr Phil Gallie (Ayr) weighed in
yesterday with comments to The Herald.
The tenor of their remarks is that the Tories in Scotland, and the
United Kingdom as a whole, should seek to build on their successes and,
as Mr Kynoch put it, stop fighting ''off the back foot''.
The loyalty of the three MPs and their obvious relish for the fight
ahead will be a boost to Mr Major at a time when his Commons majority is
looking increasingly vulnerable, and should provide a boost to party
morale north of the Border.
The MPs appear to feel that perhaps they have been hiding their light
under a bushel for too long and have lost the initiative to the
Opposition parties.
Mr Kynoch said that when he toured his constituency in 1992 he had
said he was fed up hearing people apologising about Tory policies, and
had suggested that there was a very positive story to tell.
His letter continues: ''I believe that to be as true now as it was
then. I believe that our lack of success in certain areas of Scotland
has been because all too often we hear candidates seeking to please too
many people too much of the time.
''This is the privilege of Opposition minority parties, not the party
of Government. We are a party which has successfully managed the economy
for the last 25 years, and which needs constantly to remind the
electorate of our abilities. This is a time to be positive and to adopt
a positive marketing line.''
The MP goes on to highlight a number of positive aspects of the
Scottish economy, notably the level of inward investment -- 350
companies choosing to invest #2500m in the last five years, creating
47,000 jobs.
''I believe strongly that 1995 is the year when at all levels the
party must go on the attack,'' he says. ''Our opponents have little
constructive to offer, other than high taxation and low service
delivery, but they will continue with their negative and emotional
carping.''
In his letter, Mr Robertson plays heavily on the Union card, but makes
clear his view that this alone will not be enough.
He says: ''To some in our party, it seems that to state this (the
importance of the Union) often is enough, and all else will fall into
place. That is dangerous thinking. Make no mistake, we have a fight on
our hands in persuading our fellow Scots that there is no contradiction
between being a Scot and a Tory, and to convince them that they quite
naturally complement each other. At the moment this is believed by far
too few.
''Our party's task in the dying years of this century is to win back a
lost generation of natural Scottish Conservatives who have deserted us.
John Major and Ian Lang are taking Scotland forward into the new
millenium which is prosperous and fair, where everyone has a part to
play, and where ambitions can be fulfilled. They are in the business of
building a proud, confident, and compassionate country.''
Mr Gallie also stressed the importance of the Union. ''Despite Labour
leaders' insistence that high taxation will not follow their election to
government, the evidence is ample in showing that in every area of
expenditure, apart from defence, Labour spokesmen and, more importantly,
the majority of back benchers, are committed to a massive public
expenditure increase.
''On law and order, where Conservatives have given greater powers to
the police -- stop and search and in the Criminal Justice Bill -- Labour
has opposed. Theirs are the policies of civil rights for the odd-ball
minority at the expense of protection of quality of life for the huge
majority of our citizens. Their hard words by spokesmen in the public
forum are not followed up in voting records.
''On Europe, Tories put British interests first and are criticised at
home and abroad for this. So be it, but if the electorate want to be
ruled from Brussels in totality let them vote Labour.''

DON'T be afraid. Open the door. Let us in. It may smack of wolves at
the door waiting to pounce. For some of the traditionalists, it is worse
than that. Women are at the door and demanding to be let in. What the
die-hards with their elbows on the bar don't seem to realise is that
women are already in, and now they want to share the ringside seats.
''We have to convince them that there is nothing to fear,'' says
Rosina McCrae. ''Stop fearing us. Let us in. That is what we have to
convince the brothers. With the help of the sisters they will ultimately
gain from a new system.''
She is determined to have her way, but says it is a battle of ideology
rather than a war of the sexes. Rosina McCrae will appear on many a page
in the coming months and years as the women of the Labour Party gear up
for the equality that is a foundation stone of the party philosophy.
''We have gone through hoops and jumped the hurdles and listened to
the promises. They told us: 'Stick with us, sisters, and socialism will
deliver.' Now we have to insist that those promises will be kept.''
They weren't kept, McCrae says, when Anne McGuire lost out to Bob
Gillespie who then lost to Jim Sillars in Govan, a sore that festers yet
in the ranks. They were not kept when she herself, Trish Godman, and
Irene Graham vied with Bill Millar for Janey Buchan's Euro seat and
failed to win the nomination.
''The men are sometimes unembarrassable. In the Euro ranks we have a
100% white male group. In Westminster only 13% of members are women, and
that's still twice as good as Scotland's record. When we provide almost
half of the party membership, you can bet we sense a trace of
unfairness.''
She is not at war with men, but she is in a battle for women. Rosina
McCrae, mother of two daughters and a son, a woman who made the tea for
her husband's party colleagues in Ayrshire, has come up through the
scrum and scuffle of local politics. A member of the Labour Scottish
executive, she is Central region co-ordinator of the Zero Tolerance
Campaign, the most powerful woman-protect awareness crusade so far
devised. She is also a prime mover in the Scottish Women's Caucus which
is determined to achieve a fair balance of representation.
No shrinking violet then, she means business.
''If the men's promises have failed us, we are forced to examine
mechanisms to increase our representation. Voluntarism has not worked.
When we get to selection committees we have proved that women can be as
good and as able as men.
''But men are on the committees. They have learned the language and
they can carve up their opponents. Women operate in a different way.
It's not that they are necessarily softer. They think differently and
they bring new skills.
''The Labour Party needs women for two very good reasons. It wants to
deliver for disadvantaged groups and it wants to deliver policies that
meet the needs of women. If the party had won more women over at the
last election, we could be in government today. In the marginals,
wherever there was a woman candidate, there was a measurable upward
swing. That speaks for itself.''
No argument there. But how to win the hearts of the brothers? They are
worried about the ranks of women set to take their seats in a quota
system of positive discrimination. In Midlothian, 15 women have been
selected for the same number of council seats. This will be
investigated, but the Women's Caucus is not hopeful that the rest of the
Scottish selections will be much different. Where is the next thrust
aimed?
''We gave the men painting-by-numbers guidelines and they couldn't
stick within them. One of these was to set a quota of between 30% and
50% on panels and women candidates were asked to identify their first
three choices of seat. It hasn't worked. So we need something more
radical. We want a constitutional amendment for 1998. Believe me, we are
determined we will have something firm in place for then.''
It may sound naive to ask why women are finding it so difficult to
crowbar their way in. The answer, however, shows the women's perspective
and their perceptions.
''They are afraid of what they don't know. It's an identity question
and a power question. No group gives up power willingly. They want to
keep a hold of their power base, and that is understandable. They also
promote people who actually resemble themselves. It is simple human
nature.
''With men running the system, they are on the committees, they
control the committees, they collect a load of titles and subscribe to a
value system that does not necessarily reflect what is actually needed.
A woman's experience as local playgroup chairman isn't counted. If she
runs a rape crisis centre, it's a hobby. She can organise battles for
the homeless, for the needy, for the disadvantaged, doing all the work
that the Labour Party is committed to do, but unless she is on the
committee system, it doesn't count.
''Our job is to persuade the brothers that this is the real work and
that it has value and it is what the Labour Party is really all about.
In fact, I actually joined the party after working with an
underprivileged group of men in Kilmarnock. It was their deprivation
that moved me into politics in the first place.''
Are men secretly scared of female domination? Britain's only woman
Prime Minister, Tory though she was, so dominated her Cabinet,
Parliament, and the country by dogma-driven force that the very nature
of society has changed beyond recognition. Is this what men fear?
''Possibly they do,'' McCrae concedes, ''But we are not control
freaks. If we are in the Labour Party we are there to counter the
excesses of Thatcherism and to bring back care and concern into our
national community. Men have nothing to fear from us.''
Watching from the sidelines, the battle may get rough and there will
be casualties as the Women's Caucus flexes its muscles. Definitively, a
caucus is a small but powerful committee of a political party whose
policy it directs and organises.
In the Labour Party, the women have not yet lived up to their name.
But they no doubt will.

* TONY Blair has put devolution to the top of the political agenda.
Scotland's desire for its own domestic parliament is well established.
But what do the English feel about it, and how keen are they on Labour's
plan to create assemblies in their own regions?
England is now broadly sympathetic to Scotland's case for its own
Parliament but, with the exception of the North, has no great desire for
regional assemblies of its own.
A recent opinion poll by Market &amp; Opinion Research International
(MORI) suggested that fears of an English backlash against Scottish
devolution have been exaggerated.
Most people prepared to give an opinion came out in favour of a
Scottish parliament with some powers over the levels of taxation.
The survey found that 39% of people in England were in favour and that
only 28% opposed the idea.
But the many who either were neutral (22%) or had no opinion (10%)
confirmed the impression that it was not a matter which aroused much
heat.
There was very little enthusiasm for the regional assemblies south of
the Border which Labour has promised as part of its package of
constitutional reform. In England as a whole more people (41%) were
against the idea than for it (33%).
Only in the North of England were the positions reversed. Here 39%
were in favour with 32% against. Opposition was most emphatic in Greater
London, with 46% against, and in the Midlands (45%). Again, many people
were neutral or had no opinion.
There was slightly less enthusiasm among the English for Welsh
devolution than for a Scottish parliament, with 35% in favour and 32%
against.
ANNE SIMPSON went on a tour of provincial England that began in
deepest Essex and ended in the gritty North-east. She found considerable
goodwill for Scotland's aspirations and growing anger about central
government and rampant quangos. She begins her three-day account of this
Journey Through Disaffection in the beautiful and ancient town of
Saffron Walden.
Disaffected
Little England
THAT blanket of heavy sedation which swaddles the British Sunday was
neatly tucked around Saffron Walden when we arrived. From Birmingham
onwards a raging downpour had besieged our journey but now at six
o'clock the rain here had worn itself to a drizzle which sparkled in the
lamps of High Street.
Silence hung like a safety curtain and we took it that Saffron Walden
was mutely enjoying high tea. Even within the lighted houses domesticity
moved on tiptoe: no television sounds, no noise of a closing door or
chatter of voices up and down a staircase. Not even the fretful bawl of
a teething infant, or winter cough. Yet these homes were so close to the
pavement you felt you could have leaned right over into them and settled
yourself nicely on the sofa. Oak-beamed, inside and out, and sometimes
decorated with that raised plasterwork called pargeting, the old houses
listed quaintly from exhaustion, bending towards us as if to eavesdrop
themselves on the passing gossip of strangers.
During that Sunday evening hardly anywhere could have been more
tranquil than this ancient market town, the gateway into the
north-western corner of Essex. From the high ground the
fifteenth-century church of St Mary the Virgin dominated the roof line,
its tall illuminated tower and spire appearing to spin in the inky sky.
For four centuries Saffron Walden prospered on the dye and the medicinal
and cooking properties of stamens from the saffron crocus. Then came the
wider trading which produced Butcher's Row, Fish Row, and Pig Street.
Such mercantile vigour is mainly remembered now through tourism and even
in the darkness the visitor is impressed by the curved beams everywhere,
the overhanging gables, the crooked walls washed pink, white, and green.
A harmonious place, then, and, crowned by that steeple, a God-fearing
enclave in heathen Britain. But inside our hotel the local paper
indicated a different story: Vandals on the rampage; tyres of 11 cars
slashed; pensioner's flower scheme wrecked; survey unveils pollution
problem; and -- most surprising of all -- a letter from a Conservative
Club member, deploring the club's decision to cancel a ''gentleman's
evening'' because of strident opposition from a moral minority: ''This
unseemly and disloyal fracas, splattered to as wide an audience as
possible, persuaded me that mischief is afoot . . . I am left wondering
if the likes of the police, working men's clubs, sports clubs and so
forth find 'gentleman's evenings' acceptable. Just who are these
self-appointed consciences of the Conservative Club to argue
otherwise?''
By 9pm we were strolling through the streets again to seek Saffron
Walden at play. Despite their welcoming hearths, the inns along Castle
Street and Bridge Street were empty. Only a barking dog challenged the
stillness. Either the town had gone to bed early because of a worsening
weather forecast or it was still broke from Christmas revelling. Then,
suddenly, bunches of youths approached the Market Square from opposite
ends. Not hostile but territorially rowdy, they climbed into their
fired-up Minis and Escorts, some donning crash helmets, and roared about
the town like frustrated gladiators getting in a bit of chariot
practice.
Were they driven simply by the furies of youth or, despite its
sleepiness, is rebellion in Saffron Walden's blood? This, after all, is
the place where the medieval local hero, Thomas Hickanthrift, fought a
giant armed only with a wagon wheel and an axle. Beneath the antiquarian
calm there was indeed the spirit of insurrection for slung across the
Tudor beams of the town hall in the square there was a banner blaring,
Save Our Post Office.
''They may tell us that the Post Office is now all right,'' said a
waitress back at our hotel, ''but who can believe this Government any
more? And, okay, it might be safe today, but for how long? It's the same
with education and the health service; we're being bullied into things
we don't want by people who don't care about local needs.''
Here it was, quango-mistrust, a lament which would become an
unmistakable refrain during this tour around the English regions where
secretive unelected trusts run hospitals and the Government's rough
wooing, renewed each year, seeks to persuade more schools to opt out of
local authority control.
Whether in a setting of rich, pastoral bliss or amid the battered,
hard-core verities of the North, this voice of England was loud and
irritable and sometimes at the end of its tether. But there were times
when its straightforward dislike of Westminster's centralism masked more
complicated seethings.
In England, over post-war generations, the belief that owning property
meant concrete self-advancement was a faith adhered to more devoutly
than religion itself. Now that home ownership offers no such financial
security it is as if the boot of the heretic has triumphed. In poorer
Scotland the nation's equilibrium has never wholly depended on anything
so privileged as the possession of bricks and mortar, but the damage
done by this aspect of the recession to the English psyche is profound.
The Englishman's invincible castle has been breached and for many that
outrage is all the more complex and unforgiving because it has happened
in the promised land of long-term Tory rule.
This wretched decline in property prices, the loss of confidence in
secure employment, the personal tragedies of mortgage failure and
repossession, the perception that an unaccountable elite was now calling
the shots, the feeling that vandalism was out of control and that the
provinces must gain clout against the push and shove of London . . .
these were the preoccupations in Essex, Derbyshire, the North-west and
the North-east. They must also have been the issues Tony Blair's Labour
had in mind when, in reaffirming its pledge to Scottish devolution, it
floated a belief in devolved assemblies for England, too.
But what did England feel about a Scottish assembly with taxation
powers? Did it think the UK would be grievously fractured by such a
concession? During eight days of intensive conversations with all manner
of folk not one person south of the Border felt threatened by such a
radical shake-up of the status quo. Nor was there any begrudgery about
the West Lothian Question, though, truth to tell, its dense nature was
considered best left to those posturing MPs whose only chance of
headlines is a bout of alarmism.
A Basildon man put it trenchantly: ''Any clown knows a sense of logic
will prevail when the assembly's up and running. So all this agonising
is just so much bluster. If the Scots want more control in running their
lives, let them have it. That's democracy. Why should the Conservatives
dictate to them when they're bloody well extinct up there anyway.''
This robust acceptance now of limited Home Rule for -- Scotland seemed
a measure of English people's own dissatisfaction with the Government.
People certainly wanted local government to have more muscle but the
Blair idea of a devolved England was hardly condered the solution. Its
proposals were too vague, too abstract. So much so that in the recent
MORI poll only the North of England showed moderate enthusiasm for the
idea.
Interestingly, the more northerly the direction of this journey, the
less Europhobia prevailed. On this issue the provinces, it seemed, were
leaving provincialism to London and the Home Counties, although anyone
stopping off at Brightlingsea might have detected an anti-Europe subtext
to the veal-truck ructions at the port. That fracas wasn't just about
animal cruelty in Brightlingsea's back yard. What drove the bourgeoisie
to swell the ranks of hunt-sabbers, and anarchists was a desire to
re-assert the cussed nature of Englishness against the impudence of
Europe. After all, the veal trail to Ernest Oliver's wharf was not a
sudden aberration. It was just one more manifestation of the ugliness
brought by freight traffic to a pretty little town. Brightlingsea, in
fact, has been a trading post ever since the Romans settled there and
acquired a taste for local oysters.
But in the iconography of England who is Essex Man today? And who is
Essex Gentleman? Six miles upstream from Brightlingsea there is
Camulodunum, the oldest recorded town in Britain, once ruled over by Old
King Cole and better known as Colchester. Here resided, also, that early
firebrand devolutionist, Boadicea or Boudicca, whose army massacred
70,000 Roman occupiers including those holed up in the temple built to
honour Emperor Claudius. Later Boadicea was herself defeated by the
Romans and took poison to avoid humiliation. But this was the
indisputable mother of all battles, Essex Woman, pagan war queen and
ancient forebear of Tracy. And Sharon.
Of course, the stereotyping of Essex Man is proof that the English
class system is alive and scoffing. Who it was who coined the phrase is
now a matter of smart dispute between those Tory pundits, Simon Heffer,
deputy editor of the Daily Telegraph, and MP Julian Critchley. But its
general snidery is aimed at yobs with money and given this, it seems
unfair to single Essex out when, by its own admission, the Conservative
Party has a flagrant spread of yobs on its back benches.
A native of Sheffield, John Cobley, town clerk and chief executive of
Colchester District Council, can bring a Yorkshireman's objectivity to
the subject. ''The idea always was a travesty, a bit of a nonsense
because there are hardly any native Essex people left here. What we have
is three types of Essex: estuarial Essex around the Thames with an
affinity to London; north Essex which feels a kinship with
Cambridgeshire, and mid-Essex which would like more say but is resigned
to its fate.''
Would Labour's proposal of regional government gain much support in
county? Colby thinks not, because the establishment in Cambridge of the
Government Office for the Eastern Region (Goer) should satisfy at least
some of the demands. ''Because of the decline in engineering, NHS
lay-offs, and cuts in the armed services, redundancy here in this
garrison town has been severe. But I can't see that a regional assembly
would achieve anything more than Goer.'' Cobley's attitude to Scottish
devolution is one of courteous non-interference. ''If that is what is
required, then let it be.''
But where was Essex Gentleman in all of this? The most unlikely Essex
Gentleman had been Tom Driberg, gossip-columnist, promiscuous
homosexual, alleged double-agent, and uncompromising socialist on the
left of the Labour Party. Driberg, eventually elevated to the title of
Lord Bradwell of Bradwell-Juxta-Mare in Essex, died in 1976. Over a
period of 30 years he contested many General Elections but never enjoyed
one so much as his first win at Maldon in the golden June of 1942.
According to his biographer Francis Wheen, the result surpassed even
Driberg's own immodest predictions: he trounced the 6226 votes of the
Conservative Government's candidate by almost twice that number. ''It
was an astonishing triumph. His victory statement repeated the leitmotif
of his campaign: 'I support Mr Churchill's leadership, as I am certain
all who voted for me do, but there must be drastic changes lower
down'.''
Today that old rallying cry is not without its relevance for Essex
Tories once again. Although Mr Major is no Churchill, they will not
contradict a Labour man who roots for change ''lower down''. Whether
that man would win their votes, as Driberg did so spectacularly, remains
the deepest conundrum.
If nonconformity should hold the answer, Steeple Bumpstead may be the
place. As at Saffron Walden the history of this unspoiled and lovely
village contradicts its beguiling calm. Sheltered by graceful poplars
and fat hedges of box, there is a sense of affluent decorum long sprung
from generous soil. But along Blois Road, in a field called Bloody
Pightle, a local man was burned to death in punishment for his
allegiance to the Reformation. Later nine other residents were martyred
at the stake for gathering together to read the New Testament. So, here,
was heritage red in tooth and claw. Even the name Steeple Bumpstead is
not entirely what it says, for the eleventh-century church tower, true
to its Norman vernacular, stops short of a steeple.
Stanley Drapkin, chairman of the parish council, believes there may
have been a spire imposed on it at one time but that it was probably
destroyed in a storm. Ancient legend blames a spell cast by a wizard.
More recent folklore likes to assert the steeple was ''shot off in the
war''. Inside the church there is a plaque dedicated to the memory of
that First World War heroine, Nurse Edith Cavell, who, during 1886, was
governess to the vicar's children. In 1915 she was shot by a German
firing squad for helping Allied soldiers to escape.
In fact, the only steeple evident among the thatched roofs and Tudor
chimneys belongs to the Congregational Church whose followers here
outnumber those of the Church of England. In 1966 the population of
Steeple Bumpstead had fallen to about 530, a disastrous figure, Stanley
Drapkin said, for mustering community spirit. Now the number is in the
region of 1500, sustained by a new residential estate and sheltered
housing plus a couple of little industrial enclaves for small businesses
of a clean nature.
Local historian, custodian of parish-pump affairs, and moderating
influence, Stanley Drapkin appeared to run Steeple Bumpstead with the
finesse of a benign imperial governor in a far-flung posting. And indeed
his earlier calling was in the colonial service, working in Malayia
until its independence in 1958.
A Mancunian in a Sherlock Holmes hat, he came to the village 32 years
ago, securing a power base by running the local post office for a time.
Not a busybody but a man who cares passionately about the value of small
communities, he balances off the factions in the village with the skill
of a consummate diplomat. For 30 years he has been the parish council's
unrivalled chairman. He led the campaign to restore Moot Hall, built as
an Elizabethan grammar and now the council's newly restored
headquarters.
''When I arrived rural and agricultural life was run in the old
ways,'' he said. ''I've seen these traditions evolve into something new
but not destroyed. Yet I think we now feel more suspicious of Whitehall
than ever I remember. We don't like all this power centred on London.
Politicians must be more accountable to their voters. Now when you write
to your MP about community issues like transport, education, and how we
should commemorate the victories in Europe and Japan, all that happens
is that the member plays the party game. Here we've worked hard to
welcome newcomers and make them feel they belong but it's vital we don't
get any bigger or the virtues of the village will be lost.''
If Steeple Bumpstead seems a model village, then Basildon is the
county's ''model'' new town whose concrete melancholy illustrates how
far we have sunk under the curse of dreary planning. In a sense the town
extends to Fenchurch Street station in London, the journey back and
forth, back and forth, passing over the glinting water of Limehouse and
through endless miserable tracts of commuterland where thousands of
passengers are pledged to useless vigils for late trains, cancelled
trains, trains so old they creak along on hardened arteries. In Scotland
we know little of such dingy tedium, and to arrive as a stranger in
Basildon in the rush hour is to wonder if the town enjoys any quality of
life at all.
But on market days the town centre is perky, defying architectural
brutalism. In the bar of the Towngate Theatre at lunchtime I asked some
young Turks (drape jackets, brazen ties, Portillo haircuts) whom they
considered the epitome of Essex Man: Alan Sugar, they answered:
hard-working, rich, and flash, enjoys himself and not afraid to show it.
''When you think about it,'' mused one, ''Essex Man could be a
northerner.''
At River Island in the Eastgate International Shopping Mall -- just
one more toxic pedestrian complex -- two assistants contemplated the
wardrobe priorites of Essex Woman: ''Well, it's not white stilettos any
longer,'' said the first. 'More high black boots wiv lacing, but still a
short skirt and a Wonderbra. Oh, and a small cotton top wiv a heart
embroidered on it.'' The second assistant interjected: ''Then there's
the younger ones, well, they'll go for anything tacky.''
So, Tracy and Sharon live, as they do everywhere, for a pay packet to
fund their tribal chic and a night out with the girls. ''They might get
a bit drunk and flirty,'' said the Towngate manager, ''but next morning
they're back at work, never thinking a thing about it.''
''It's rubbish, this Essex Man stuff,'' said Ernie Berry, selling US
jeep caps and camouflage jackets from his market stall. ''Some
comedian's idea of a joke. They say the Scots are mean, the Irish are
thick, and Essex Man is the oldest swinger in town. Well, in Basildon,
Billericay, and Brentford there's no such thing as Essex Man. We're all
East End Cockneys. It's just the snobs trying to put down the working
class but the working class don't give a damn.''
Across the road the shabby prefabs of Basildon District Volunteer
Carers' Centre hadn't managed to blight the camaraderie within. The
whiff of cleansing fluid played havoc with the nasal passages but the
real air of the place was one of convivial defiance against the odds. A
sign in the window pleaded: We need toe-cutters, chirophody for the
elderly.
''Put it this way, if the Scots really think they can manage
devolution, then there's no good reason to stop them,'' said organiser
Brenda Groves. ''As for down here, I just don't think we've got the
calibre of person to make it work in local government. The standard of
national politics is bad enough. To be honest, I probably won't vote in
the next General Election I'm so disgusted with the lot of them.''
That night the trip back to London took on the familiar dismal rhythm
of delay because of line failure and trains cancelled for lack of staff.
Only the passing tower blocks seemed more welcoming than before. Lights
were being switched on in cheery kitchens and little sitting rooms to
create those tidy commuter sanctuaries against the hassled world
outside. If there had been any doubt that this was a journey through
disaffection, it was banished now by one particular gobbet of graffiti.
Hurled against an empty platform notice board, the words in splayed,
black lettering read: Merry Xmas to the rude staff at Barking Station.
We were one month into 1995 and not even British Rail had summoned the
energy, or perhaps the heart, to wipe away that blast of exasperated
anger.
* ESSEX GENTLEMAN, Stanley Drapkin, chairman of Steeple Bumpstead
Parish Council, speaking at the council's newly refurbished quarters in
Elizabethan Moot Hall: ''If the Scots wish to have a form of devolved
government it is right that they should have it. Scots must decide. But
their devolved government would be very different from anything we might
seek and therefore it cannot be equated with regional government for
England. Scotland is an ancient nation with a separate history, legal
system and culture. It has a community spirit on a grander scale,
because it is based on Scotland's national history and achievement.
''England is totally different. Regional government here would merely
be another tier of costly administration, for which there would be no
passion, love, loyalty or even interest -- no more interest than existed
for the European Parliament. English tribalism is county-based.
''In my view more power should be devolved from Whitehall to county
councils. The people have a historic link with these, an affinity, a
bond of loyalty and pride. Some county councils' responsibilities could
be devolved to district councils, that is: social services which would
tie in well with housing. There are certain matters -- transport comes
to mind -- which might require a regional perspective by a national
grouping of county councils.
''East Anglia is a good example. But they would not need a new costly
layer of regional government with its own elected members -- instead
elected representatives from the county councils could be drawn into a
sort of super strategic and planning committee tailored to the region. I
feel very strongly that our future as a country depends on creating
solid foundations of independent, spirited communities with pride and
faith in themselves.''
* ESSEX MAN, Ernie Berry, stallholder in Basildon, speaking in the
city centre on market day: ''Don't tell me the recession's over. That's
a load of rubbish. When I lived in the East End of London where I was
born I was a member of the East Hackney Conservative Club but the Tories
will never get my vote again. I'll vote Labour although I think their
plans for devolution in England are daft. All right for the Scots,
because you know what you'd be getting. Here there's no understanding
about what it would entail because there's no demand for it.''
* ESSEX WOMAN, shopper in Eastgate International Mall, Basildon: ''I
suppose I'm Essex Woman. Basildon, it's not a bad place but I hate it. I
came here from Folkestone 19 years ago and I've never recovered. I took
early retirement working with the council and it really depressed me how
unintelligent the officials were. It's not just here but everywhere. If
the public knew they'd be horrified. So there's no way I'd want to that
lot to have devolved powers. Up in Scotland you'd probably get a better
bunch because as I understand it your education is superior. Good luck
then.''

<TEXT>
A FORMER director of security for the International Air Transport
Association has warned that proposals by the Department of Transport to
cut its aviation security unit, Transec, by 34 jobs are a ''highly
retrograde'' step.
Mr Rodney Wallis, who held the security post from 1980 to 1991, warned
that, although terrorist threats from some Middle East countries had
subsided, they could easily return.
The Labour Party's transport spokesman, Mr Michael Meacher, said he
would be raising the issue in the House of Commons today and claimed the
cut of 30% in security staff at Transec to save money would be an
''incalculable loss to public safety''.
He added that the cuts were ''a false economy which would undermine
public confidence in security''.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney personally approved the 30% cut in
task force personnel who set anti-terrorism standards for airports and
ports, according to a leaked letter.
Mr Meacher yesterday attacked Dr Mawhinney for reassuring the House
last week that he took security ''very seriously indeed'' when the issue
of safety in the Channel Tunnel was raised.
The Department of Transport did not deny the report, but claimed that
security would not be affected.
A spokeswoman said: ''These savings are part of a department-wide
exercise in improving efficiency. Transport security remains a high
priority and there is no slackening of determination to achieve and
maintain a high standard.''
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's industry spokesman, added: ''It strikes me
as completely irresponsible to cut back on safeguards which passengers
have come to expect and rely on. Although a couple of terrorist threats
have subsided, there are always others to take their place. It is
another example of the Tories confusing efficiency with cuts in staff.''
Mr Wilson added: ''It would make a lot more sense if the new airport
tax was specifically dedicated to security instead of just being another
means of raising revenue.''
The proposals were also attacked by Dr Jim Swire, spokesman for the
families of the British Lockerbie victims, who said that money was being
valued above human lives.
He said the cuts were ''an insult to the memory of those who died''
and warned they would significantly increase the risk of another
tragedy.
Tighter airport security was promised by the Government in 1989 when
it became clear the suitcase bomb which destroyed the PanAm flight 103
over Lockerbie had passed through Heathrow undetected and unaccompanied
by a passenger.
Dr Swire said: ''They are in flagrant breach of promises made by a
succession of Secretaries of State.'' He said that the head of Transec,
Mr Harry Ditmas, had written to him in 1993 saying that there was
''still a considerable way to go before aviation security in the UK can
be deemed to be at an acceptable level''.
The cuts will also affect Transec's ability to check security
facilities in foreign airports.
Mr Wallis said that during his term as director of security he had
constantly opposed the Government's position that its responsibility
ended the moment British registered aircraft left British air space.
He said: ''The level of attention that foreign governments pay to
security varies tremendously. If the British Government simply sits back
and says it is up to somebody else to do that, it is saying it knows and
is prepared to let British aircraft into unsecured areas -- and that is
quite unnacceptable.''
Mr Wallis added: ''There have been very few international incidents of
aircraft terrorism since Lockerbie. But there have been any number of
domestic incidents, particularly in Russia and China.''

US Senate Republican leaders said today that President Bill Clinton's

confirmation.
Abortion rights activists, meanwhile, announced a nationwide drive in
support of Dr Henry Foster, 61, whose confirmation prospects were
clouded by the disclosure he had performed abortions.
''Will it (the nomination) be in some difficulty? Yes,'' Senate
Majority leader Bob Dole of Kansas said on the NBC programme Meet the
Press.
Dole said he had not yet decided whether to oppose Foster, who said on
Friday he had performed ''fewer than a dozen'' abortions in his
Tennessee gynaecology practice.--Reuter.

FIFTEEN times more people live to 100 in Britain today compared to 40
years ago, a conference on caring for the aged will be told today. In
1991 the number of centenarians reached 4390 -- and is still climbing.
Mr Nick Bosanquet, professor of health studies at London University,
says that people over 80 will account for a third of the expected
increase in population by the year 2010. By then one person in 20 will
be over 80, compared with one in 33 today. The conference on the issue,
at London's Royal Society of Medicine, will hear that #1500m needs to be
spent in the immediate future on nursing and residential homes to care
for Britain's ageing population.

THE solicitor of jailed paratrooper Lee Clegg was yesterday
threatening legal action to prevent a TV ''mock trial'' about the case
being broadcast tonight.
Mr Simon McKay is demanding to see a video of BBC1's Panorama
programme -- The Trial of Private Clegg -- before it is screened.
He said: ''I have no objection to discussion and opinion on both sides
of the argument, and I have welcomed it. But I am gravely concerned
about the potential nature of the programme, given its sensitive timing,
and fear it could damage my client's case.''
He said Clegg knew about the programme. He is serving a life sentence
for the murder of teenage joyrider Karen Reilly, who was a passenger in
a stolen car which failed to stop at an Army checkpoint in west Belfast.
Mr McKay, speaking on behalf of the Clegg Committee which is
campaigning for his release, said it had tried to promote fair and
balanced debate about the case. But it had declined to participate in
the documentary.
The programme is expected to have barrister Michael Mansfield, QC,
making a case for the 26-year-old Bradford soldier being kept in prison,
while Sir Ivan Lawrence, QC, argues for his release.
At the end of the programme, presenter David Dimbleby will ask a
studio jury to deliver its verdict.
Mr McKay said that neither he nor Clegg had been consulted by the
''counsel for the defence'' and added: ''Whilst deferring to Sir Ivan's
experience and abilities, we find this feature of the documentary, with
respect, absurd.''
Panorama was responsible for the documentary, Lethal Force, which
highlighted the shooting incident in 1990 in which Karen Reilly died,
inferring it was part of a shoot-to-kill policy operated by Her
Majesty's forces in Northern Ireland.
Mr Mansfield and Sir Ivan will question witnesses to the shooting,
including people from the local community and supporters of Clegg.
The programme will look at the pressures facing soldiers in Northern
Ireland, their record of killing civilians, and ask if they should be
charged for murder on active service.
Clegg's mother, Mrs Wynne Johnson, was also invited to take part but
refused.
A spokesman for Panorama stressed that the programme was not a retrial
of Clegg.
''However, for the first time, a cross-section of the British public
will be asked whether it is right that Private Clegg should stay in jail
for the murder of Karen Reilly,'' he added.

THE artistic director of Perth Theatre is to leave the company after a
board decision to cut rehearsal time from three-and-a-half weeks to
two-and-a-half.
Mr Andrew McKinnon said yesterday he would not be seeking a
continuation of his five-year contract beyond the end of his third year
in April next year.
The theatre's general manager, Mr Paul McLennan, denied speculation
that there had been a row between Mr McKinnon and the theatre's board,
adding the move was ''not a resignation''.
However, he confirmed that Mr McKinnon was not prepared to work for a
longer period under the terms of cuts agreed by the board. The
disagreement was ''nothing to do with the choice of plays but the length
of rehearsal time'', he said.
Mr McKinnon said he was not in any position to disagree with the
board, in view of the theatre's ''sizeable deficit''.
He said: ''They were acting on my recommendation. There is no other
way of running the ship. The sums don't add up and three-and-a-half
weeks' rehearsal for productions would cost up to #70,000.
''There isn't another decision to make. Our ticket prices are already
the highest in Scotland, and #3 more than Dundee Rep.''
He said he was not prepared to commit himself long-term to the pattern
of work.
''Two-and-a-half weeks restricts the range of work you can do. The
conditions I would like to see for my work are not there and they were
there before,'' he said.
Perth Theatre is unique among Scotland's repertory theatre in having a
large subscription base of some 3600 people. It produces 10 plays and a
pantomime each year.
Many other theatres produce less work with a longer rehearsal period
for each. The theatre's board has clearly chosen not to reduce the
number of shows, fearing it would lose subscribers and guaranteed
income.
Mr McLennan denied that the cut was an indication of serious financial
problems.
He said: ''By comparison with other producing theatres in Scotland we
are still in a relatively healthy state.''
Mr McKinnon's statement described his time at Perth as ''fascinating
and stimulating'' and paid tribute to the staff and executive committee.
He said: ''Perth's planning schedules are such that it is necessary to
make clear my intentions a year in advance so that there can be a smooth
transfer to my successor.''
Mr Archie Martin, executive committee chairman, said Mr McKinnon's
decision had been accepted with regret.
He added: ''Mr McKinnon has prepared programmes which aim to reinforce
the loyalties of existing supporters and attract new subscriptions.''
Mr McKinnon trained in Perth in the 1970s and returned in the spring
of 1993.
He took control of the theatre in July of that year with the retiral
after 25 years of Miss Joan Knight. He had worked in theatres in
Nottingham, York, and Newcastle, and was latterly the director of the
Actor's Centre in London.

<HEADLINE>Labour leader promises social justice in attack on Tories Major has divided Britain, says Blair</HEADLINE>

LABOUR leader Tony Blair yesterday launched one of his strongest
attacks so far on the Prime Minister, accusing him of presiding over a
divided Britain.
The Prime Minister had said Labour's devolution plans were the biggest
threat to the United Kingdom since the Spanish Armada, but the real
threat was here and now -- social division on a scale that it shamed
Britain's standing in the world.
Mr Blair's comments, in which he also found time to defend the
proposed changes to Clause 4, suggest that tensions between the two main
parties already are building up in advance of the next General Election
which could, technically, be over two years away.
In London on Friday, Mr Major set out his stall for the next election,
concentrating on the key themes of Europe, Northern Ireland, and the
constitution. Mr Blair effectively did the same thing yesterday, playing
to what he would perceive to be his key strength -- social justice.
He told a Labour conference in Brighton: ''The Prime Minister can keep
his myths and his misrepresentation of our policies. The real threat to
national unity comes from the real policies that he and his party have
perpetrated upon this country for almost two decades.
''Yes, Britain is in danger of breaking up and it is the Tories who
are doing the breaking. It is not a Scottish parliament that makes
people scared to leave their homes at night, it is crime.
''It is not local democracy that wrecks whole towns and communities,
it is long-term unemployment. It is not our plans for reform of the
House of Lords that tear families apart, it is the bungled introduction
of the Child Support Agency.
''How can we feel pride in a society which has four million children
living below the poverty line? How can we possibly claim this is an
efficient society making full use of the talents at its disposal when 11
million people are on benefits, when Government pledged to break down
dependency has more than doubled it?''
He insisted that Labour's answer -- social justice -- was as relevant
to the comfortably off as to the poor, and it was essential for economic
success.
''Action on poverty is social justice, but so is fair treatment from
your bank manager. Help with your mortgage when you are made unemployed
-- that is social justice. But so is the right to know what is happening
to your pension fund. A minimum wage -- that is social justice. But so
is government doing what it can to help small businesses off the ground.
''Social justice is about an alliance of the poor and the comfortable
attacking vested interests which hold all of us back, in dealing with
poverty at the bottom and greed and excess at the top.''
On Clause 4, Mr Blair said modernising the party's aims and values was
a symbol of trust. ''It shows that we who ask for the right to change
our country have had the courage to change ourselves. More than that, it
allows us proudly to proclaim what our values and principles are.''
Meanwhile, Mr Blair was last night facing accusations of hypocrisy as
it emerged that the school to which he is sending his son refuses to
recognise trade unions for negotiating purposes.
Tory MPs reacted with delight at the news that the Oratory School in
London set its own pay levels without consulting teaching unions. They
saw it as fresh evidence of double standards after the Labour leader
decided to take advantage of Tory education reforms to send his son
Euan, 10, eight miles across London to a grant-maintained school.
The disclosure came as the Shadow Employment Secretary, Ms Harriet
Harman, whose son already attends the school, pledged that Labour would
give every worker the right to union representation.
The Oratory School became the first to exercise its right to opt out
of recognising national pay scales. Head teacher John MacIntosh claims
its teachers earn more than the national average.
''I myself am a member of two unions,'' he said. ''While we do not
recognise unions for the purposes of negotiations, unions are not banned
here. If a member of staff has a problem or a grievance, I will often
suggest the member of staff consult his or her union.''
Mr MacIntosh, who is a member of the Secondary Heads Association and
the National Association of Head Teachers, estimated about two-thirds of
the 85 teaching staff at the school were union members.
Dover MP David Shaw said: ''The whiff of hypocrisy is like the largest
stench one can possibly imagine. All the senior Labour politicians with
young children seem to be rushing to find schools which don't operate on
trade union lines.''
Ms Harman refused to comment. However, she had earlier told the
conference that Labour would introduce laws to ensure workers had a
right to join a union and to have that union recognised.
A spokesman for Mr Blair said he would not be withdrawing his
application for his son to join the school.

EXPATRIATE American novelist Patricia Highsmith, author of a string of
acclaimed suspense novels including Strangers on a Train, died in
Switzerland at the weekend, aged 74.
She had entered hospital in Locarno a few days earlier. No details
were disclosed but the novelist was believed to have been suffering from
leukemia.
Highsmith's works attracted critical acclaim and the admiration of
many writers, including Graham Greene.
Strangers on a Train (1950), which was filmed by Alfred Hitchcock, was
followed by a series of books featuring the character Tom Ripley, a
plausible psychopath, as her hero. Her last published book was Ripley
Under Water (1991).

LABOUR yesterday launched a fresh assault on executives' pay, claiming
that the wage gap between bosses and workers was higher in Britain than
in other countries.
Employment spokewoman Harriet Harman accused the Government of
defending excessively high pay and claimed the Tories were ''on the
side'' of the privileged.
She said BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance, embroiled in a row over pay
last week when he said it would be ''relaxing'' to work as a junior
doctor, was earning #180 an hour, compared to #1.80 for a security
guard.
''No wonder this country is divided between the super-rich and
everyone else,'' she told Labour's local government and youth conference
in Brighton.
''More successful countries than ours have a lower pay gap. In
manufacturing, chief executives get 10 times more in Japan than the
average in their industry, in Germany it is 11 times more but in Britain
it is 16 times more.''
Ms Harman said Labour planned to write to members of the Cabinet and
to heads of the privatised utilities asking what would be the lowest
wage they would work for.

A SINGLE jackpot winner will scoop #10.3m in the national lottery, the
organisers, Camelot, said.
Announcing the provisional results of Saturday night's draw, Camelot
said four others could expect to win #796,000 for matching five numbers
plus the bonus ball.
About 800,000 others will stake a claim in the #28m total payout.
The numbers 1, 7, 37, 38, 42, and 46 were drawn at Tintagel, Cornwall,
after ticket sales soared to #62m. The bonus number was 20.
A total of 487 people are expected to match five numbers and claim
#4087, with 27,456 matching four numbers for an expected #159 payout.
The #10 prize for three numbers will probably be won by 807,216 punters.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith called on the watchdog body,
Offlot, to investigate reports that an American shareholder in the
British game was at the centre of an investigation into bribery and
corruption.
Mr Smith said Offlot needed to ''double-check'' the conduct of an
American firm, GTECH, and the running of the British lottery.
But Camelot dismissed the reports and said GTECH was checked out
''thoroughly'', along with all other shareholders.
Mr Smith's call for an investigation into GTECH follows a newspaper
report claiming it was investigated by the FBI for alleged bribery and
corruption.
The report also says former Cabinet Minister Lord Moore is one of its
British directors.
The American company has been involved in bids to control several of
the state lotteries run in the United States.
A case involving a former GTECH employee accused of money-laundering
and fraud was thrown out of court in America last month after company
bosses were not called as witnesses, according to the report.
Mr Smith said: ''There has been no sign at all of any improprieties in
the running of the lottery here, but I think it is very important that
this matter is double-checked.''
A spokesperson for Camelot said: ''This particular case that was
reported on was not a case involving GTECH but a former employee. The
judge made it clear that GTECH was not being accused of any
wrongdoing.''

HUNDREDS of spectators watched spellbound as a hump-backed whale
reared out of the water yards from Greenock esplanade at the weekend.
The whale's antics attracted attention around noon on Saturday and
within a few hours the walkway was packed.
Previous sightings had been made near the Cloch lighthouse in Gourock
over the past two weeks but it was Greenock that enjoyed the best
display. At regular 30-minute intervals for five hours, the whale
wallowed and spouted water through its blowhole.
Nature groups had warned the public not to approach the giant mammal
by boat, but one animal organisation tried to approach it for a close
look.

AN attempt to preserve the boat-building tradition of the Western
Isles for posterity has had an unexpected result.
Mr John Murdo Macleod, 71, the last of a long line of Lewis
shipwrights, and his assistant Angus Smith, 36, received two orders in
one day for sgoths -- open wooden fishing skiffs -- at the Scottish
Boat, Caravan, Camping and Leisure Show in Glasgow's SECC, which
finished yesterday.
The pair were there to drum up charter business for their 33ft sgoth,
Sulaire, at a stand donated by the show organiser, Eventex.
The vessel's eight-month construction was recorded for a documentary
by an independent Stornoway television producer, Mr Sam Maynard. The
last full-size sgoth was built by Mr Macleod's grandfather in 1918.
However, on Thursday, the Stornoway boat builders found themselves
with another five months' work, building two more sgoths.
Mr Smith said: ''We did not expect it at all. It wasn't a business as
such, but we were hoping to make it into a business eventually. This
just brings it forward that much sooner.''
A #15,000 order for an 18ft sgoth, which will take about three months
to build, came from Islay. The second order, for a 13ft vessel costing
#5000, came from Edinburgh.
Both vessels will be used as pleasure boats.

WORDS such as commitment, character, and battling quality were
repeated many times in the smoke-filled media room at Rugby Park on
Saturday evening.
The speaker was Aberdeen manager Willie Miller, but the disappointing
aspect for the visiting supporters who trudged out of the trim Ayrshire
ground with only depression for company was that such utterances
certainly did not apply to their men.
Miller was trying to put his finger on the qualities that Aberdeen
lacked against Kilmarnock in a 3-1 defeat. However, since most of the
audience were hoping to return home before midnight, they were happy
that the manager confined himself to the most pressing point.
''Kilmarnock certainly won the battle,'' said Miller. ''They never
stopped. We had a good 15-minute start and got a break with a goal, but
then forgot what it was all about.''
But forgetting what it's all about appears to be a trait not uncommon
to Aberdeen's lot this season, to which their league position will bear
witness.
The ''good 15 minutes'' mentioned by Miller was mainly because it took
that amount of time for Kilmarnock to get going. But once in the groove
there really was only one team in the match with a zest for the job, and
as a result Aberdeen now are, in their leader's words, ''in a war
zone.''
But fear not, all you members of the red-and-white army; your
commander has fresh troops in waiting to bring into the struggle to
avoid the dreaded drop.
The trouble is that these new men have fresh, young faces and when
push comes to barge in the basement the question is: are youngsters
really ideal in such a situation? Miller is of the opinion that this is
so.
''I'll play players who will get us out of this situation,'' he said.
''When you are in the trenches you need people who will be big enough to
see you through.
''We have young players who have shown the right attitude, and they
will get their opportunity, but basically we must first sort out the
defence.''
Yes, Willie, the defence would be a good place to start. But while you
are there the midfield could do with a little attention. Oh, and don't
forget the striking department; it looked a little suspect at the
weekend.
In short, Aberdeen were something of a shambles and the people who
continue to mutter glibly that they are too big a club to take the drop
should go along and watch them at work. Perhaps then their belief may
alter.
Even the sight of Roy Aitken's grey locks glistening under the Rugby
Park floodlights when he came on as a substitute -- and was booked --
could not galvanise Aberdeen into performing to the standard expected of
them.
Something has to give -- or go -- at Pittodrie to break the lethargy
that seems to have settled within the club, and the sooner the better,
for if not . . .
On the other hand, there was a smile on the face of Steve Maskrey as
he clutched a bottle of bubbly as man of the match. The Kilmarnock
striker had been involved in all of his side's goals, scoring one and
helping to set up strikes by Tom Brown and Mark Roberts to answer an
opener by Stewart McKimmie.
However, he did have a message for club manager Alex Totten, who is
reputed to be searching for another striker. ''Perhaps he should just
keep his money in the bank,'' said Maskrey. He's got a point, Alex.

PHILANTHROPIST or just another over-inflated ego? There was a case to
be made for both viewpoints as that flawed genuis Romario was claiming
more than his customary share of the headlines in the week just past.
Giving generously on one hand to the street urchins who inhabit Rio,
arrogantly predicting the next that he will transform Flamengo into the
world's dominant club, Brazil's World Cup-winning striker remains a
highly complex character.
With masterly understatement, that gentleman of football, Bobby
Robson, who was eventually ousted from PSV Eindhoven by a vendetta from
the born-again Christian Romario, said he was the most difficult player
he had ever had in his charge.
Much more critical was Johan Cruyff, who, his patience finally
exhausted at the wayward star's antics, sold him off last month even
though the transfer has undoubtedly weakened Barcelona's challenge in
the Champions' Cup.
Announcing his new centre, which he will fund out of his own pocket
along with the government, Romario said it would provide the opportunity
for the hapless children who inhabit Rio's sewers to receive
professional sports training and a proper education.
Saying it will be named after his young son, Romario then displayed
the less appealing side of his nature.
''What happened in Barcelona belongs in a museum; I don't care about
what Cruyff had to say about me,'' he insisted. ''My future is with
Flamengo. We will be champions of Brazil for the next five, six years.
We will be the best side in South America and the world.
''This is no empty boast. I am now creating a team better than any
before -- full of quality and talent and marvellous for the world to
watch.
''I am the best player in the world. My record proves that I am. I
have won championships in Holland and Spain. I promised the people of
Brazil that I would bring back the World Cup from the USA and I did.''
* ALLEGATIONS of corruption have brought controversy to the
forthcoming elections to decide the presidency of Real Madrid.
Ramon Mendoza, currently occupying the post at the Bernabeu, has
admitted using the names of 120 deceased 'socios'(club members) among
his official list of supporters.
Mendoza's regime is already under severe criticism for the club's dire
financial plight although this season's improved results have eased the
pressure.
Nevertheless, his rival for the presidency, Florentino Perez, is ahead
in the opinion polls for the post which will be decided later this
month.
* ATHLETIC Bilbao has extended the contract of their emerging
international, Guerrero, until 2007. Interest has been intensifying on
the midfielder who has been at Bilbao since he was an eight-year-old.
* WELSHMAN John Toshack is being linked with the post at Deportivo la
Coruna which will become vacant at the end of the season when Arsenio
Inglesias departs.
* AJAX'S latest prodigy, Patrick Kluivert, has the best strike rate in
Europe. The 19-year-old, likened to Marco Van Basten, has scored 13
goals in 896 minutes of league football for the Amsterdam club -- one
every 69 minutes.
Drugs disgrace
THE German FA will today reveal the punishment to be imposed on Roland
Wolfarth, whose confession to drugs abuse has created yet another
scandal in the Bundesliga.
The veteran striker with VfL Bochum, who saw his best days with Bayern
Munich, admitted taking the banned steroid, Norefidrine, in order to
shed weight.
He was tested positive on January 5 at an indoor tournament, raising
fears that their widespread abuse in the Bundesliga despite a crackdown
initiated two seasons ago.
Wolfarth said in mitigation that he had gained 14lbs during the winter
break and had been threatened by his coach, Klaus Toppmoller, that he
would be fined #400 for every pound he was overweight when he reported
back for training when the season re-started last week.

TWO climbers who survived two nights in a snow hole near the summit of
Ben Nevis were discharged from hospital yesterday after issuing a
statement offering ''a million thanks'' to the mountain rescue team.
''We have never been so relieved as when we saw three men from the
team coming towards us. Thanks to the police and the RAF too,'' the
statement said.
Ms Zoe Green, 20, and Ms Iona Kim Roden, 22, both students at the
University of Central Lancashire, were rescued on Saturday. They
survived for almost 40 hours after digging a snow hole to shelter from
gale force winds and driving snow in sub-zero temperatures.
Accompanied by relatives they walked unaided from Belford Hospital in
Fort William yesterday. A spokesman said Ms Roden still had mild
frostbite in her feet while Ms Green was said to be ''fine''.
Ms Roden, of Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, and Ms Green, of
Pittsmoor, Sheffield, are members of the university union's climbing
club which sent a party of 15 to Lochaber last Saturday.
On Thursday, they decided to tackle Ben Nevis in separate parties. But
the two failed to return to their rendezvous at Glen Nevis youth hostel
that evening after getting stuck on an ice climb. Their colleagues
raised the alarm.
The two students, who were well equipped for winter climbing and had
been trained in survival techniques, dug a snow hole to shelter from the
winds and driving snow.
Three members of Lochaber mountain rescue team found them on Saturday
huddled in the snow hole on a steep slope near the summit.
An RAF helicopterflew them to hospital where they were treated for
exhaustion and hypothermia.

BRITAIN should introduce an early-release programme for convicted
terrorists as a means of keeping the faltering peace process on track in
Northern Ireland, a senior Scottish academic suggests today.
Mr Michael von Tangen Page, an expert on political violence and penal
policy in Northern Ireland and a member of the influential Department of
Peace Studies at Bradford University, says the selective release of
paramilitary prisoners could be ''pivotal'' to the continuation of the
five-month ceasefire by both sides.
In a briefing paper, which has been distributed to key members of all
of the main political parties in the UK, he argues that a carefully
phased release scheme would not only allow the Government to satisfy
some of the paramilitaries' demands for the return of their members, but
might also be linked to important concessions such as the handover or
destruction of arms caches.
The 24-page study says an unconditional amnesty for terrorist
prisoners would not be acceptable to either politicians or to the
relatives of victims. But international experience had shown that early
release gave the authorities the chance to be selective in choosing who
was to be freed and when.
Mr Von Tangen Page, orginally from Aberdeen, said last night: ''The
political motivation behind a terrorist's crime, together with the fact
that paramilitaries tend to be psychologically very different from other
criminals, justifies their alternative treatment.
''If the political problem which caused the individual to take up arms
in the first place is resolved, then the probability of re-offence is
minimal. It leaves the main remaining reason to detain prisoners as the
tariff or punishment period that has to be served.
''As the release of prisoners is one of the few concessions that the
authorities can make towards the paramilitaries, it elevates the
captives to a potentially pivotal position in the peace process.
''The fate of the Irish prisoners . . . is vital to the long-term
success of the current peace process. It is essential that the
politicians within Sinn Fein and those representing loyalist
paramilitary interests are able to be seen to secure some successes.''
He adds that any release scheme would also have to give the state the
right to recall prisoners if they re-offend, and must be sensitive as
far as possible to the feelings of victims or their relatives where the
perpetrators were involved in extreme violence.
This could be done easily in the case of short-term prisoners, but
would have to reflect the need for ''lifers'' to serve a substantial
part of their original sentences in the interests of justice being seen
to be done.
A precedent has already been set by Britain in the early release of
convicted members of the Official IRA after that organisation declared a
ceasefire in 1972. Some of that group were freed after serving only
seven years of life sentences. That ceasefire has never been broken.
The report admits that the instinct of the Conservative Party in
Britain, and of the Ulster Unionists, as well as the general public,
would be to punish rather than reward. But it was vital at least to
begin the process by adjusting the remission available to selected
prisoners.
It concludes: ''If the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom
wish to see the gun taken out of Irish politics for good, now is not the
time for small-mindedness. The failure to address the prisons' issue
soon could well produce the seeds of a new outbreak of violence.''

PARTICK Thistle manager John Lambie is holding all the aces in a
reluctant tug of war with Saturday's match-winner against Hibernian, Rod
McDonald.
The former Walsall player hit a priceless winner at Easter Road, which
takes the Firhill side to within touching distance of Aberdeen, Dundee
United, and Falkirk at the foot of the table.
McDonald wants to return to England to attend to family problems, but
with the eye of experience, Lambie spots the horrendous problems that
would accompany his departure.
''He is going nowhere and still has a year of his contract to run. He
has problems back home, but we all have problems,'' insisted Lambie.
McDonald's eye for a chance was perfectly illustrated on Saturday and
with Roddy Grant now out for 12 weeks with an eye injury, Thistle simply
couldn't cope without both.
It was Albert Craig who set up the sixty-ninth minute winner,
delivering a perfect through ball to leave the English striker to steer
the ball past Jim Leighton from 20 yards.
''It was good to get a win bonus, but the most important thing for us
was the three points. We have a great chance of staying up, with Dundee
United still to play twice,'' suggested McDonald.
The celebrations of the few hundred Thistle fans at full time seemed a
million miles away, as Hibs swarmed around the Partick penalty box in
the opening period.
Pat McGinlay signalled that he is back in the old Easter Road routine
when he sent an unstoppable volley past Nicky Walker in 18 minutes,
after Gregg Watson had headed out a Kevin McAllister cross.
But Tommy Turner preceded McDonald's strike when he headed an
equaliser in 34 minutes, after a thunderous Steve Pittman shot rebounded
off Leighton's bar.
The Edinburgh side were a strange mix, and it may be that in the short
term they will have to put their undoubted skills to one side and role
up their sleeves.
In last month's Edinburgh derby, they were outfought and defeated, the
same happened on Saturday, and even at Montrose in the Cup, the third
division team's industry produced vulnerable moments.
This new soft centre may have been introduced by Brian Hamilton's
departure to Hearts and, in fairness, Alex Miller would have cured the
problem had he been successful with his approach to Dundee United for
Jim McInally.
The stakes are high for Miller's men, for with so much inconsistency
around Hibs, the remaining, solitary UEFA Cup spot could be earned in
the next six weeks.
* BIRMINGHAM City manager Barry Fry has confirmed reports that his
goalkeeper, Ian Bennett, was offered #20,000 to throw the recent FA Cup
replay with Liverpool.
Fry said that two people masquerading as journalists had offered
Bennett the money at City's training ground five days before the Anfield
clash. ''A couple of people who said they were journalists from
Singapore said they had made Bennett the man of the match in the first
game and wanted to interview him and take a few pictures.
''The next minute, Ian comes up to me and tells me that the two men
had said there was #20,000 in their car for him if he threw the replay
at Anfield. I raced out into the car park to confront them, but they had
disappeared -- and then I immediately contacted the Football Association
to tell them of the approach.''
Bennett performed heroics in the replay at Anfield -- only being
beaten by a Jamie Redknapp shot which hit a post and rebounded into the
net off his head -- as Birmingham went out after a penalty shoot-out.''
FA Chief Executive Graham Kelly said the police had been informed
about the approach.

ANIMAL rights protesters staged a demonstration last night at the home
of a Tory MP who helped to block a Bill to ban livestock exports.
About 50 demonstrators were found at the Birtley home of Mr Peter
Atkinson, MP for Hexham, Northumberland, when police answered a 999
call. Mr Atkinson and his daughter were not at home.
Nine demonstrators climbed on to the roof, but after a peaceful
protest lasting 30 minutes came down. A police spokesman said minor
damage was caused but no-one was arrested.
He said the protest was over the part Mr Atkinson played in the
blocking of Carlisle Labour MP Eric Martlew's attempt to stop calves
being exported to spend the rest of their lives in foreign veal crates.
Mr Atkinson was shown on TV coverage of the parliamentary proceedings
reading out names of companies from the London telephone directory in a
time-wasting bid to block Mr Martlew's Private Member's Bill.
* A mother whose daughter was killed while protesting against live
animal exports said yesterday she was also willing to die for the cause.
Mrs Nancy Phipps said: ''I will go on campaigning and if it takes my
death, I will die with Jill.''
Mrs Phipps's husband Ben, 70, was charged with trespass on Saturday
during another protest at Coventry airport where his daughter Jill, 31,
died in an accident with a lorry carrying animals last Wednesday.

IF THERE is any one game this season which should be preserved as a
classic example of Scottish League football in the nineties,
Motherwell's collision with Celtic at Fir Park is the one. Everything
that we have come to expect about the premier division was on display.
There were the usual ingredients -- speed, agility, courage.
But, maybe if the tape is preserved for future generations, it will be
what was missing that will prove the real reminder of what has been lost
in the craving for victory.
The absence of subtlety, of intelligence, of craft, of football as we
knew it, was deeply depressing for anyone who hopes the old ball game
can be revived.
It was one of those days when the goals could have been removed and
the keepers sent home to watch the racing.
There was virtually no danger of anyone causing as much as a flutter
in the penalty area, other than the one time when Celtic's two tall
central defenders got too close to Motherwell's wee substitute and
literally paid the penalty, but even that can be tolerated if there is
some good midfield play to please the eye.
There was none of that, either. The contest in the middle of the park
was a bit like those Rugby League games where one man picks up the ball,
charges forward, is dumped, passes to another mate who charges forward
and is dumped. Then it is the turn of the other side. It may make good
entertainment for the RL fans, but it doesn't do a lot for those of us
who prefer a rather more cerebral style of ball game.
Perhaps it was all a result of two teams being too well-matched, but
that is a paltry excuse for such a display of juggernaut football.
Managers may wish to see better stuff -- indeed, Alex McLeish said as
much -- but their living depends on scorelines and I suppose it is not
entirely fair to castigate them for allowing their men to leave their
skills in the dressing-room.
It has become the custom in this division for the first 15 minutes of
most games to be a battle of wills and macho determination, followed by
a little less freneticism, and, eventually, something approaching
skilful exchanges. At Fir Park, the first 15 minutes went on for an
hour-and-a-half, if you see what I mean.
McLeish was 'ecstatic' -- his word -- about winning the three points
and, after a run of four matches without a win, was entitled to be
pleased.
He acknowledged that 'it was not much of a game', as did Celtic's
Tommy Burns, but admitted that he had been trying to get through to his
players that there are occasions when they have to 'dig' out victories.
His men did that.
Celtic dug in just as competitively but lost out with that penalty,
scored by Rob McKinnon late on. They didn't deserve to go down but
weren't worth a win, either. Their Dutch striker, Pierre van Hooydonk,
seemed transfixed by it all in the first half. As players hurtled around
lunging into tackles, pushing and shoving and body checking, Pierre must
have wondered if he had meandered into some kind of Gaelic ritual,
rather than the pass-the-ball modus operandi which has been his lot to
date.
In the second half, it was almost comical to watch him -- presumably
in frustration -- try to join in this battering-ram version of the game.
He is pretty hopeless at knocking people down without being caught. He
has a lot to learn about the quiet, wee foul on the blind side, the knee
in the back, the gentle dunt, and all the rest in the modern British
'dirty tricks' manual.
His shoves and bashes were out front and cost him fouls each time, not
to mention a booking. In that he was not alone. Three of his team-mates
were shown yellow cards, Tom Boyd, Brian O'Neil, and Peter Grant, while
Motherwell's two frontmen, Tommy Coyne and Dougie Arnott, also were
booked.
There will be people who will criticise referee Stuart Dougal but, in
the circumstances, I thought he did well enough. If he had been less
vigilant the game could have been worse, and that is saying plenty.
A defender had to be man-of-the-match and Brian Martin was it.
Typically, he had comforting words for the two Celtic men, Brian O'Neil
and Mark McNally, who sandwiched Paul McGrillen six minutes from time to
give away the penalty.
''Maybe, it was a bit of inexperience by them that caused the penalty,
but they are young and will have learned from that,'' he said.

A PAY increase for nurses of 2.5% will be funded by job losses and
increased workloads unless the Scottish Office promises to provide
enough money to cover the rise, Unison claims.
The Pay Review Body is expected to award nurses and midwives around
2.5% with an extra 0.5% for productivity. However, a study by Industrial
Relations Services showed that last year's rise of 3% was funded by
increased workloads, changes in skill-mix, and job cuts.
Mr Jim Devine of Unison said that Scotland's 70,000 nurses were also
alarmed by aspects of performance-related pay.

A UNION has warned that it will fight ''tooth and nail'' to prevent
substantial job losses at the Nobel's Explosives Company plant in
Ardeer, Ayrshire.
The warning, by the Transport and General Workers' Union, was given
yesterday as a management spokesman confirmed a review of the plant,
announced by parent company ICI last August, was complete.
The union fears the review could result in 200 of the 760-strong
workforce being cut.
ICI stated last summer it would have to reduce its explosives
division, because of a decline in the UK market, largely because of
changes in the coal industry.
Management said then that the restructuring would mean job losses,
although they could not say how many. They said in November that the
review, expected to take a few weeks to conduct, would not be completed
until the spring.
However, a management spokesman confirmed yesterday: ''I gather the
review is now complete. ICI Explosives expects to make an announcement
soon.''
Mr Allan Clements, general manager of ICI Explosives Europe, expressed
doubts in November about how operations could be brought to ''an
acceptable level of profitability''.
While he appreciated the continued uncertainty over results of the
review, he said it was important any decision should not be rushed and a
range of options thoroughly considered.
Mr Harry O'Neill, the union's district secretary, said yesterday:
''Our shop stewards' fear is a real one. It is so serious we have
already started our campaign to oppose redundancies.''
As well as being a manufacturing base, the Ardeer plant serves as
headquarters for the Nobel's Explosives Company, which has two smaller
plants, near Wigan and in North Wales, employing about 125 between them.
Under the restructuring plan announced in the summer, the firm's
affairs are being devolved to three business units and the position of
NEC managing director is being discontinued.
* The DIY retailer, B&amp;Q, is to create more than 2000 jobs as part of
an investment in new warehouse outlets and revamped superstores.
About 70% of the jobs, announced yesterday, will be filled by
part-time staff, working anything from eight to 30 hours a week.

NEW rules governing New rules governing the job protection rights of
part-time workers came into force today.
Now those working less than 16-hours a week will have the same rights
as full-timers in written contracts, notice of dismissal and
compensation for unfair dismissal, redundancy pay, maternity leave, and
time off for trade union duties.
The new legislation affects nearly six million workers throughout the
UK, about 87% of them women.
The Equal Opportunities Commission fought for a year to convince the
House of Lords that the treatment of part-timers was potentially
discriminatory -- because the vast majority are women.
Employment Secretary Michael Portillo finally announced changes
affecting part-timers' employment rights just before Christmas, which
became official today.
The Low Pay Unit in Scotland ran a campaign on part-timers' unfair
treatment, following the EOC success.
''We had thousands of responses'', said the LPU campaign organiser, Mr
Peter Hunter, ''but this is only one step. Part-timers across Europe
still have better conditions than British workers.''
The Low Pay Unit has already backed several people claiming unfair
treatment. Its campaign was helped by the public service union Unison,
which has a large number of part-timers as members.
''Obviously this Government decision is an important milestone,'' said
Ms Eileen Dinning, Unison's women's officer in Scotland. ''But some
employers will look for loopholes and we will continue to campaign for
the better rights already existing in the European Union.''

Earlier in the evening, Councillor Gould had lost out on a vote for
the Maxwell Park ward. It is understood someone had nominated him out of
mischief.
Elsewhere it has been a bad time for women aspirants.
Last night district councillor Margaret Sinclair lost Crookston to

THREE ''professional and determined'' robbers escaped with #250,000
worth of jewellery in a raid on the Queen's jewellers, Garrard's, in the
heart of London's West End yesterday.
But it was not until five hours later that police discovered the
thieves had fled from the jewellers in Regent Street.
A large section of the West End had been sealed off as more than 70
officers, some of them armed, surrounded the building. Buses and cars
were left abandoned in the middle of Regent Street as police laid siege
to the building.
The drama began at 10.25am when one of the thieves, dressed as a
policeman, followed two Garrard's security guards into the back entrance
of the jewellers.
Detective Chief Inspector Colin Harry, of the Flying Squad, based at
Barnes in south-west London, said the bogus policeman then let in two
other men.
The two security guards were blindfolded and tied up. They had been
about to take a bag of jewellery to unspecified ''continental clients''
in London.
The robbers snatched this bag and made off in a Volvo estate car.
Mr Harry said the raid took no more than 15 minutes.
Police were quickly on the scene and surrounded the building after the
security guards freed themselves and raised the alarm.
The thieves were still thought to be in the jewellers but five hours
passed before police discovered they were not there.
Mr Harry said they were very complex premises to search. ''The search
was thorough -- it had to be.''
Mr Harry said it was believed the thieves had arrived -- and escaped
-- in a blue/green Volvo 740 estate, registration number: L436 GUD.
Onlookers said the two security guards, who were wearing civilian
clothes, appeared to have been arrested by police who mistook them for
the robbers.
Shop assistant Daniel Filipovic, 21, from Finsbury Park, north London,
was walking to work when he was approached by a man with a bandage on
his head at the rear of Garrard's.The man was a security guard who told
him to ''run to a telephone box and fetch the police''.
Mr Filipovic said: ''By the time I got through police had arrived and
'arrested' him.
''They told me later that he was a security guard, even though he was
dressed casually in jeans.''
Mr Michael Bay, who works at a clothing shop opposite, saw a man --
believed to have been one of the guards -- emerge from the jewellers.
''I saw a man in his 40s come out with his hands up. He hit the deck
straightaway.
''He was led away by police. Officers with machine guns, sten guns,
and handguns were sprawled across the road in Regent Street.''
Mr Richard Jarvis, Garrard's managing director, said about #250,000
worth of jewellery was taken. It included two brooches among four or
five pieces.
He said it was a collection of jewellery for several international
clients which was going to be shown to them.
He said: ''I do not think that they knew what was in the bag -- they
could be very disappointed.''
The vaults had not been breached and their security systems had not
been broken.
Mr Jarvis said that they would be looking very hard at their security
procedures to ensure another raid like this could not take place.
''In the 30 years I have been with the company nothing has happened
like this before.''
He added: ''The value is not significantly high -- somewhere in the
region of #250,000. I think we did get off lightly.''
About 20% of the shops in the section of Regent Street sealed off
would have been open yesterday.
They are thought to have lost thousands of pounds in trade. Those
affected include Next and the Disney Store.
One shop manager said: ''They have probably lost around 10% of their
weekly takings.''

The prize, worth a total of #100,000 to the winner, exceeds the annual
budget for the entire festival, a small-scale midsummer event run by
part-time staff that buys in its administration.
The final, held in the Royal National Theatre at the South Bank
Centre, featured six companies which each had already won #25,000 in the
individual category awards for film, theatre, visual arts, music, opera,
and dance.
The total monies distributed by the Prudential Awards this year
exceeded #300,000.
Michael Tumelty was a member of the music panel for this year's
Prudential awards. His feature on the judging process will appear in The
Herald's arts page on Wednesday.

FROM a poll commissioned exclusively by The Herald, and carefully
conducted inside Ibrox on Saturday evening, it became clear that one out
of two managers involved in Rangers' game against Dundee United was
absolutely convinced the Ibrox side should have had two penalties. It
is, as yet, unclear what the other manager felt because no-one was quite
certain what he was saying.
It sounded like: ''Well, ya now . . . da boys, dey try har.''
Sometimes a poor sports hack just has to try to put all the words in
some kind of order and take a stab at making them sound good. A bit like
an opinion poll, really.
Fortunately, most of us don't have to resort to market research to
understand what is happening at the footy and it was patently obvious
the other day that a Rangers side functioning well below optimum were
not too perturbed at having to accept a draw while United, who looked
more purposeful than in many other matches this season, collected what
could be a valuable point as they struggle to free themselves from the
relegation quicksands.
Furthermore, it wasn't necessary to grill anyone to understand
foreigners played significant roles in the match. In fact, one of the
''outsiders,'' Jerren Nixon, took it upon himself to display the balance
and touch which often prompts his United manager, Ivan Golac, to make
the most preposterous pronouncements.
Nixon, you may recall is the winger from the Trinidad and Tobago
national side who, according to Golac, is worth at least #10m.
However, Golac admitted he was disappointed with Nixon's finishing
even though the 21-year-old scored the opening goal at Ibrox. A goal,
incidentally, which left Rangers' defence looking rather shame-faced.
Nixon drifted into Rangers' penalty box as United worked the ball down
to Maurice Malpas deep on the right in 23 minutes. The defender swung
the ball to the far post where David Hannah rose and headed into the
middle leaving Nixon, who had darted into a yard of space, to do little
more than nod and United were in front.
It was a simple goal and United's small band of supporters were
ecstatic, but not for long. Five minutes after having fallen behind,
Rangers engineered a goal of their own with Brian Laudrup playing the
telling pass through to David Robertson, who had surged down the left
channel.
The full back cut inside and thumped the ball into the net, the speed
of the ball deceiving keeper Kelham O'Hanlon. ''I'm not one for placing
the ball,'' Robertson said afterwards. ''I just try to hit it as hard as
I can.''
Robertson was mindful to mention the part played by Laudrup, who had
one of his quieter matches which was in no small part due to the
diligence of United's Dave Bowman. Golac remembered that Laudrup had
been outstanding when Rangers won 3-0 at Tannadice the last time the
sides met, and the manager was determined he would be watched more
closely.
However, in trying to tie Laudrup down, United left a great deal of
space for Robertson to use and he did so to good effect. In fact, he
might have had two penalties in the second half, once when he appeared
to be fouled inside the box by Sergio Gomes, United's Brazilian striker,
and, again, when he was brought down by Robbie Winters, a substitute for
Gomes in 70 minutes.
Both times the referee, Hugh Dallas, looked long and hard -- and both
times he allowed play to continue. Many referees might have given both,
but most would surely have awarded a penalty for the second incident.
Rangers' manager Walter Smith was not at all happy. ''I remember a
season or so ago that the Dundee United manager came to Ibrox and said
that if it had been any other ground his side would have had a
penalty,'' he said.
''I think he would say now that isn't the case. If this had been any
other ground other than Ibrox today we would have had two penalties.''
Smith spoke out even though he knows the clerk, who sits in a backroom
within SFA headquarters monitoring all utterances by football people,
will report his words to the hierarchy and a fine may well follow.
Often, however, a manager just has to have his say, no matter the
consequences, and Smith couldn't be prevented from questioning the
referee's decisions even though Saturday turned out to be not a bad day
for Rangers.
Even though they were held to a draw, the Ibrox side stretched their
lead at the top of the premier division from 14 points to 15 because
Hibernian lost at home to Partick Thistle.
Also, the Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist partnership was reunited with
the former starting the match and the latter taking over from Gordon
Durie 12 minutes from time.
Rangers are beginning to look more like the real thing and the
likelihood is that they will win their seventh successive championship
by a street.

A ROW over extra cash payments for councillors has broken around the
Scottish Local Government Minister, Mr Allan Stewart.
Hundreds of local authority councillors are to get double allowances
for a year if they are elected to new shadow authorities while still
serving on the old councils.
The decision, which is said to be outlined in a directive from Mr
Stewart, has angered Conservative councillors who described it as a
waste of public money.
Glasgow councillor John Young, honorary president of the Association
of Scottish Conservative Councillors, said he was ''surprised'' at the
scheme.
''I don't think the general public will be happy with this. They won't
view it with any enthusiasm or favour.
''There is the financial question to be addressed. I believe it will
cost around #14m and yet we are supposed to be strapped for cash.
''While councillors on the new shadow authorities are doing
preparatory work, I do not think it will be onerous.''
Bailie Bill Aitken, leader of the Conservative group on Glasgow
District Council, said the notion of two council allowances for some
councillors was wrong.
''As I see it, there will be a number of councillors earning double
income for what certainly will not be double work. It is difficult to
see how it can be justified.''
The current structure of local government in Scotland will be swept
away when new single-tier authorities take over on April 1, 1996.
Allowance levels vary according to the size of councils, but in
Glasgow councillors can qualify for up to #5800-a-year before
deductions. Under the new authorities that figure will rise to #6000.
Elections for the new councils take place on April 6 this year, and in
the interim period candidates who are returned as councillors will serve
on shadow authorities which will run side by side with the current
structure.
A large number of serving councillors are expected to be returned as
councillors of the shadow authorities in April, and have a dual role and
therefore double allowances for a year.
News of the doubling up was given to Labour councillors in Glasgow by
city treasurer Gordon Macdiarmid. He said: ''The decision is nothing to
do with us. It is purely a Government decision. We didn't want or ask
for reorganisation.''
Bailie Macdiarmid said he thought the payments would be justified by
the extra workload councillors would have to undertake to get the new
councils ready for operation.
Mr Stewart last night defended the position, saying: ''They will be
doing two jobs, so they will be entitled to two sets of allowances.''

SCOTLAND rugby scrum half Brian Redpath and his fiancee, Miss Gillian
Hall, were among those first on the scene when a mother and her two
young children were killed in a road accident in the Borders yesterday.
Mr Redpath and Miss Hall, a nurse at the Borders General Hospital,
were returning to Melrose after Saturday's international against Ireland
when they came across the victims' Vauxhall Astra.
The car had been almost obliterated by the force of the impact with an
articulated lorry on the A68 three miles south of Lauder.
''It was horrific,'' Mr Redpath, 23, said. ''We went out to see if
there was anything we could do for the injured. Others had stopped but I
think we were the first to the car. The woman was still alive and
Gillian tried to get her air ways clear.''
The couple then assisted a general practitioner called out from
Lauder.
''I was holding the oxygen bottle and my girlfriend the mask,'' the
Melrose player, clearly distraught, said. ''I have never seen anything
like it. I just wish we could have done more. It just puts everything
else, like rugby matches, into perspective.''
Ambulance paramedics and fire crews helped the rescue attempt but
their efforts were also in vain. Both children were killed instantly.
The woman and her young son and daughter are believed to be from
Midlothian. Police were withholding details until relatives had been
informed.
The lorry driver was unhurt but suffering from severe shock. Police
were hoping to interview him last night.
Accident investigation officers from Lothian and Borders Police were
later attempting to find out how it happened. The car was travelling
southwards on the A68 on a bridge section over the River Leader, as the
lorry from Batley, West Yorkshire, headed northwards.
The force of the impact was on the car's passenger side, after which
it appears to have careered around and crashed into the bridge parapet,
throwing a wheelbrace and other items into the river.
It was imposible not to be moved by the scattered wreckage littered
all around: a child's teddy bear, a smashed buggy, a Snow White tape,
and a mangled child safey seat still anchored to its fittings in the
rear of car.
Sub-officer Frank Preston, whose fire crew used cutting equipment to
release the casualties, said: ''I have seen many accidents in 25 years
but it is always worse when young kids are involved.''
Police have appealed for witnesses to the accident which occurred
shortly after 11am.

JOHN Major had an affair when he was in his early twenties with a
mother-of-two who was 13 years older than him, it was claimed yesterday
in Esquire magazine.
The article claimed that primary school teacher Jean Kierans told a
former colleague of Mr Major's that they had ''a very worthwhile and
satisfactory affair''.
Mrs Kierans was 33 when she moved to a flat across the road from Mr
Major's family in Brixton, south London, when he was 20 in 1963 -- and
seven years before he met his wife, Norma.
Mrs Kierans had separated from her husband, Terence, four years
before. He eventually emigrated to Australia.
She told Mr John Rennie, a retired banker who worked with Mr Major in
Nigeria in the mid 1960s, that her two children -- Kevin and Siobhan --
regarded the future Prime Minister as a surrogate father.
Esquire claimed the affair fizzled out soon after Mr Major won a seat
on Lambeth council in 1968.
Mr Rennie, who now lives in West Sussex, said he gathered at the time
that the relationship was winding down by mutual agreement.
Mrs Kierans, now 65 and living in Streatham, south London, would only
confirm to Esquire that she once knew Mr Major when they both lived in
Brixton.
The magazine quotes her as saying in a good-humoured way: ''I'm not
going to tell you anything. I'm a real meanie, aren't I? But I'm a nice
person and I'm not going to be rude to you or anything like that.''
Alongside the article is a small picture of grey-haired Mrs Kierans
pushing a supermarket trolley.
She has never remarried and is said to spend a lot of time in her
second home in the Pas de Calais in northern France.
Her daughter Siobhan, now 39, recently completed an anthropology
degree in Bristol and has done some work for the BBC. According to
Esquire, she normally votes Labour or Green but feels personally loyal
to Mr Major.
Her elder brother Kevin is an interior decorator living with his
American wife and their son in Washington state on the west coast of
America.
He told Esquire he would not talk about that period unless he was
paid.
Mr Major met his wife Norma in 1970. They were engaged in three weeks
and married six months later.
Mr Major was spending the day in his Huntingdon constituency.
Ms Kierans said yesterday at her flat in Streatham, south London, she
had no wish to talk publicly about her memories of the young future
Prime Minister.

FALKIRK acquired a timely boost for tonight's rearranged Tennents
Scottish Cup tie with Motherwell, securing a comprehensive victory over
Hearts.
It brought an end to a miserable few weeks for the Bairns, their first
win in three months arresting a slide down the premier division table.
But tonight's tie is not uppermost in Falkirk's minds, as goalkeeper
Tony Parks admitted: ''We want to do well in the cup but the match with
Dundee United on Saturday is more important.
''We got ourselves into a good position early in the season, then let
ourselves down by playing badly.
''We haven't been playing as a team but we got that back against
Hearts. We wanted to win more than they did -- we're in a position where
we can't afford to lose.''
In truth, Hearts were deeply disappointing in what was never a great
game. To call the first half mediocre would be generous.
However, after the break, Falkirk pressed the advantage they had
gained from a Steve Fulton headed goal from a corner after 30 minutes.
They looked the hungrier side and, as manager Jim Jefferies argued,
could have had more goals if only the second had come earlier.
Eddie May, Colin MacDonald, and Fulton all had opportunities to add to
the tally, but Falkirk had to settle for substitute Nicky Henderson's
strike three minutes from time.
''We've got something we can build on here,'' said Jefferies. ''And,
if we keep working hard as a team, we will do it.''
He agreed that the poor run had not always been a result of poor form.
''We've been missing chances and being punished but, against Hearts,
we were really fired up,'' he said.
Jefferies still hopes to strengthen his side before the end of the
season.
Joe Allen, of Port Vale, is a target, but the English first division
side are slipping into relegation trouble.
''We've made an offer,'' said Jefferies, ''but they want to hold on to
him because they are in a tricky situation. The picture might change if
they get a couple of wins.''
Allen is a proven goalscorer, thought not at present making the first
team.
''We don't have a natural scorer, as the Hearts match showed,'' said
Jefferies.
He, too, played down the importance of tonight's match. ''The most
important thing for us is to stay in the premier division, a run in the
cup would be an extra,'' he said.
The first attempt at playing the match ended just after half-time last
Tuesday because of a floodlight failure, but the spark seems to have
returned to Falkirk.

A BIRTHDAY goal for Romanian internationalist Gheorghe Hagi and a pair
of well-timed substitutions from Dutch coach Johan Cruyff helped
Barcelona to a 3-1 win over Sporting Gijon yesterday.
Hagi, celebrating his thirtieth birthday in front of 79,000 fans in
the Nou Camp stadium, was at the centre of almost every Barcelona move.
On 19 minutes he latched on to a deep cross from Bulgarian forward
Hristo Stoichkov to equalise for the Spanish champions after unfancied
Gijon had taken the lead in the tenth minute through ex-Real Madrid
player Jose Morales.
Cruyff's second-half substitutions secured the two points Barcelona
needed to stay in touch with league leaders Real Madrid. The Dutchman
brought on Javier Eschaich for Javier Eskursa, and eight minutes later
Eschaich, in his debut for the Catalans, gave them the lead.
With a quarter of an hour remaining, Stoichkov, whose differences with
Cruyff have been aired in public in recent days, was replaced by Ivan
Iglesias. Again the change payed dividends, Iglesias wrapping up the win
with a goal five minutes from time.
Elsewhere, Real Betis kept up their impressive form with a 1-0 home
win against bottom club Logrones. Polish internationalist Wojciech
Kowalczyk scored for the Seville club.

FEARING witchcraft, a team refused to go through the main entrance of
a stadium in Mwanza, western Tanzania. Instead, the Kenya Breweries
players entered by the spectator gates.
It worked. They won Saturday's East and Central African club
championship match against Tanzania's Young Africans 2-1.
* TEENAGE striker Patrick Kluivert took his goals total to 15 for the
season as he helped Ajax Amsterdam to a 3-1 victory over NAC Breda. John
van den Brom added a third before Frank Rijkaard conceded a penalty,
converted by Peter Remie.
Ajax lead the championship by three points from Roda JC Kerkrade, who
thrashed Vitesse Arnhem 5-0.

THE jockeying to become the last Lord Provost of Glasgow District
Council has developed into a two-horse race.
Bailies Alex Mosson and Tommy Dingwall were picked as the sole
candidates of two separate Labour factions at private meetings held late
last week.
Members of the 55-strong Labour group will decide which one is to
become Lord Provost when they meet on Wednesday.
The victor is virtually guaranteed to have his appointment ratified at
a special session of the full council to be called on Friday.
In traditional City Chambers fashion, both candidates refused to
comment in detail on their selection.
Bailie Dingwall, 64, is being backed by the Tribune Group which
elected current city leader Pat Lally. Mr Dingwall said: ''I would
rather wait and see if I am elected before I say anything.''
He is the convener of the council's powerful arts and culture
committee and the current deputy chairman of the council.
Bailie Mosson, 54, has been selected by a rival group of left-wing
councillors who support former council leader Jean McFadden. He is the
convener of the central area management committee and a former
vice-chairman of the Glasgow District Labour Party.
He would only say: ''If I am nominated I will accept that
nomination.''
Whoever wins will hold the post for little more than a year. From
April 1996 Glasgow District Council will be replaced by a separate
single-tier authority.
The post of Lord Provost fell vacant last month after the death in
office of Councillor James Shields.

FOOTBALL casuals brandishing knives, sticks, and coshes fought a
pitched battle at the weekend in the Gallowgate in Glasgow.
Forty-four men, mainly in their late teens and early to mid-twenties,
were arrested after the disturbance which happened on Saturday night.
They are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today in connection
with the incident.
The trouble flared about 6pm when the casuals, some wearing Dundee
United colours, clashed with others sporting Rangers scarves near the
Barrowland market.
The game at Ibrox ended in a 1-1 draw after Dundee United had taken
the lead in the 23rd minute. However, the Dundee United supporters had
not been at the game because their coach had been late in arriving in
Glasgow.
Instead, it is believed, the supporters had asked the driver to let
them off at Glasgow Cross where they went drinking.
It was an hour or so after the game had finished that the two rival
sets of supporters confronted each other.
Police said the first indication that trouble was brewing came from a
local publican at about 5.40pm. A spokesman said: ''We would describe
the incident as a large-scale disturbance.
''In years gone by you would get 50 arrests but nothing like this has
happened since the introduction of the Criminal Justice Scotland Act in
1980.''
One of the main aims of the Act was to introduce new powers to combat
disorderly conduct associated with sporting events. To that end it
became illegal to take drink into a football match, be drunk at a game,
or to take drink on to a hired coach.
Police said that three of the supporters involved in the running
battle had been slightly injured. They had recovered a number of weapons
including knives and coshes.
The spokesman added that they had also taken ''other bits and pieces
of a more dramatic nature'' but refused to say what they were. However,
it is understood that no guns were involved.
Police said the battle did not last long because there had been a
large police presence in the area to deal with fans coming back from
games. The officers had also been backed up by the Special Support Unit
which is designd to respond to crowd trouble.
The spokesman said: ''The fighting erupted at about 6.00pm and lasted
for about 10 minutes. We were away from the scene at 6.20pm.
''The Dundee United fans had reboarded the bus and we were able to
arrest them on it. It had not moved off.''

THE whiff of garlic and Gauloises is already in the air. The Scottish
selectors meet on Tuesday to choose the team which will take Scotland's
Five Nations' campaign to Paris on Saturday week. It may well prove to
be one of the briefest selectorial cabals on record.
''Same again Scotland'' read the headline when a newspaper scribe
intruded on a selection meeting of by-gone days and, mistaken for a
hotel waiter, was ordered to provide more of the same in the way of
thirst-quenching beverage.
After Saturday's victory over Ireland at Murrayfield and the
mould-breaking defeat of Canada, the current crop of Scottish selectors
will be sorely tempted to order more of the same so as not to upset a
winning combination.
In the immediate aftermath of Saturday's match, Scottish manager
Duncan Paterson was giving little away: ''We haven't even thought about
Paris yet, to be quite honest. Tonight is a night for celebration. We
will study the match video and then we'll pick the team.''
And, with a reference to the axe which scythed through the Scotland
side after last November's defeat by South Africa, he added with what
some took to be a smile: ''I can tell you, though, that there won't be
10 changes this time . . .''
The Scots have not won in Paris since 1969 and have never tasted
victory since the French moved their international ground from Stade
Colombes to the Parc des Princes. Never mind that England's 31-10
demolition job on France at the weekend will have resurrected Gallic
doubts and misgivings or that the Scotland skipper Gavin Hastings
seriously fancies his side's chances in gay Paris. France will still be
mighty hard to topple on their own patch.
The Scottish pack will, in all likelihood, and rightly, be reselected
en bloc.
Kenny Logan on the left wing possesses the kind of confidence in
abundance which, unleashed, can make French flair flop. Craig Joiner
over on the right flank is still an international tenderfoot and he will
find the volcanic atmosphere at Parc des Princes a severe test of nerve
and mettle.
Derrick Patterson provides more of a physical presence than Bryan
Redpath at scrum half but Redpath has done little wrong and the
selectors will probably stick with him.
Craig Chalmers is an enigma. The Scotland fly-half unleashed some
provocatively telling tactical punts against the Irish on Saturday but,
equally, others went awry. He was also, uncharacteristically, caught in
two minds -- both of them undecided -- when attempting a lame drop goal
which seemed to have been fashioned from the Kevin McKenzie drop-kicking
manual.
Meanwhile, and it's a big meanwhile, the selectors will want to look
again, and no doubt for the umpteenth time, at the Townsend-Jardine
partnership in the centre. Scott Hastings still burns with indignation
at his omission from the side after the Springbok defeat and Tony
Stanger's conversion to an international centre was given a major boost
with his match-winning display against Ireland A.
Additionally, Stanger would provide much the same physical presence as
Jardine -- but with more pace -- if the selectors remain, as they are,
thirled to the notion of playing a big man at inside centre. Stanger
allied to the electric pace of Townsend has much to commend it.
The Americans, big on sayings but little on the world rugby map, have
a maxim for every occasion. In the context of Tuesday's selectorial
deliberations ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' is the one which
springs to mind, and the selectors will probably agree.

THE influential rail and shipping union RMT, which sponsors leading
Shadow Cabinet members John Prescott and Robin Cook, is rejecting any
reform of Clause 4 of the Labour Party's constitution.
Confirmation of the decision, which is a blow to efforts by Labour
leader Tony Blair to modernise the party's image, will come in an
announcement today from Unity House, the headquarters of the 68,000
member National Union of Railwaymen, Maritime and Transport Workers, but
the decision was taken after an all-day meeting of the union's national
executive committee on Friday.
The union had asked its political sub-committee to draft an
appropriate response on the Clause 4 question. This was considered on
Friday, and the 19-strong national executive voted unanimously to reject
any attempt to weaken or modernise Clause 4 and its fourth paragraph
committing the Labour Party to ''common ownership of the means of
production''.
Scottish NEC member Alan Pottage said the view was that Mr Blair
should never have started off down the road of attempting to move the
party away from its core socialist principles.
''The whole debate about Clause 4 is unnecessary,'' he said. ''It is a
distraction at a time when we should be concentrating on attacking the
Conservative Government and promoting the case to keep railways under
public control.
''It's not about words on paper. It is the whole sentiment behind
them. The decision to change Clause 4 is about the Labour Party wanting
to dilute its commitment to socialism, which we are 100% behind
retaining.
''There are very few people objecting to Clause 4. We represent the
workers that have suffered through privatisation, sea workers and bus
workers who have to deal with poorer working conditions while directors
and managers receive fat bonuses.
''We are delighted that we are putting into practice the view of our
association and its membership in backing one of the most fundamental
core rules in our own rule book.''
News of the decision will give heart to the hard left of the Labour
Party who have been campaigning to save Clause 4, and will disappoint
the party leadership. In the battle to win over party activists towards
the cause of modernising the constitution, Mr Blair has been making use
of his deputy leader, Mr Prescott.
Now, as an RMT sponsored MP, Mr Prescott is to be asked to address a
meeting of the national executive late this month or early next. ''We
are looking forward to a robust debate,'' said Mr Pottage, who said that
although they had no power to instruct a sponsored MP on what line to
take on an issue, ''we expect the values and aspirations of our members
to be reflected.''
When contacted, Mr Prescott said that since there had been no official
comment from the union he was not prepared to comment.
Mr Pottage, a member of the same Edinburgh branch of the union as Mr
Robin Cook, said the MP for Livingston could also expect to be
questioned by the branch on his recent conversion to the Clause 4
modernisers' camp.
Mr Cook last night said he was not particularly surprised by the
union's decision, but he declined to comment. ''It really is not for me
to say. It is a matter for the union executive,'' he said. Asked whether
he thought the decision was significant, he said: ''Any decision that
commits trade union votes at the special conference is obviously
significant.''
A fierce debate on Clause 4 is expected at the party's Scottish
conference in Inverness next month.

SCOTTISH Office Minister Allan Stewart last night admitted being
involved in a heated confrontation with anti-motorway campaigners in
Glasgow.
The MP for Eastwood said that, at one point in the altercation
yesterday, he had picked up a pickaxe, fearing for the safety of himself
and companions, who included his son.
Meanwhile, Strathclyde Police last night confirmed they were
investigating an alleged assault on one of the protesters during Mr
Stewart's visit to Pollok Castle Woods, in his constituency.
The incidents happened yesterday afternoon, when the Minister arrived
without advance warning at a site in the woods, where workmen last week
felled a number of trees in preparation for the extension of the M77
through the South Side of Glasgow.
Mr Stewart was accompanied by his son, Gareth, two Conservative
candidates for seats in the new Eastwood unitary authority, Mr Richard
Cook and Mr Neil Deerey, and Mr Dan Pollard, the director of roads for
Wimpey Construction, which holds the #54m contract to develop the new
road.
In a statement issued late last night, the MP said: ''Shortly after
arrival, we were rushed by a group of about a dozen protesters. There
was a pickaxe at my feet.
''I freely admit that I was afraid for my own safety and that of my
companions and I picked it up to prevent anyone else doing so.
''We then endeavoured to return to the car, but our path was blocked
by a group of protesters. An exchange of views certainly took place and,
for a few moments, the situation was extremely unpleasant.''
Mr Lindsay Keenan, 30, from Linwood, a member of the Earth First!
protest group which has set up a camp at the site, claimed last night
that he had been pushed in the chest. He said he had fallen backwards
into other protesters, but had not been injured.
Mr Keenan said he had reported the matter to the police. They later
took statements from a large number of witnesses, including Mr Stewart,
who spoke to officers at Giffnock police station.
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said last night: ''We can confirm that
inquiries are under way following an allegation that a 30-year-old man
was threatened and assaulted at a protesters' camp in Pollok Park.''
He declined to confirm the identity of the alleged assailant, but said
a report would be sent to the procurator-fiscal.
Mr Stewart vigorously denied he had done anything illegal, and
asserted his right ''as an individual and MP to walk up and down paths
in my constituency''.
He said he had made the private visit ''in advance of anticipated
discussions this week with the Scottish Secretary about the motorway
extension''.
Mr Stewart, whose Ministerial portfolio does not include roads, said
he would be raising yesterday's events with Strathclyde's chief
constable, as he was unhappy at ''being unable to go about my lawful
business as the constituency MP''.
However, he said that after the confrontation, he had had a reasonable
discussion with a small group of protesters and had agreed to meet them
at a later date to hear their concerns in greater detail.
A spokesman for Wimpey said the company did not wish to comment on the
incident.

ULSTER Unionists yesterday stepped up their threat to pull the plug on
Mr Major's Government if it presses ahead with proposals for the future
of Northern Ireland.
Senior members of the party made it clear that if the framework
document being drawn up by the British and Irish Governments contained
proposals for all-Ireland bodies with executive powers -- as suggested
in leaks last week -- they would withdraw support for the Government.
Unionist leader James Molyneaux raised the stakes when he ordered
constituency parties to choose candidates in all Northern Ireland seats
where they do not have a sitting MP in preparation for a General
Election.
Mr David Trimble, UUP MP for Upper Bann, warned: ''If the
Conservatives move into a position of hostility to the Union by
endorsing all-Ireland political institutions, it will not be possible
for us to support them.''
Support from the nine Ulster Unionists has been vital to Mr Major in a
number of recent Commons votes.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said there
would be an election ''sooner rather than later'' if the Government
acted against what Unionists saw as the best interests of Northern
Ireland.
However, the threat of a snap General Election receded when a Labour
spokesman said it would be ''futile'' to table a motion of no confidence
in the Government. This would simply force the Euro-sceptics back into
the fold and the Government would win.
In addition, the Labour spokesman on Northern Ireland, Ms Mo Mowlam,
said that, while it pained her to say it, she would always put the Irish
peace process before traditional partisan politics. She said: ''We have
made it clear our support for the framework document. I have said
repeatedly that this is not a question of party politics. If they
continue to treat people on both sides properly and fairly there will
not be a chink between us.''
The snap election reports gathered ground over the weekend after the
discloure that Ms Mowlam and, indeed, party leader Tony Blair, had been
making overtures to the Unionists.
The Unionists believe Labour is reining back from its traditional
''united Ireland'' stance and is much closer to the long-standing
Conservative stance that in the end it will be for the people to decide.
The situation is highly sensitive, but the feeling at Westminster last
night was that the Unionists were firing a warning shot across Mr
Major's bows and would await developments.
They clearly have not been convinced by the reassurances given last
week in a television broadcast to the nation by the Prime Minister.
One senior Unionist figure was quoted as saying: ''In a few weeks we
will get the framework document published, and, if it contains offensive
sections about all-Ireland bodies with executive powers, then the
Government will have decided to have a direct confrontation with the
Unionists.''
However, Mr Maginnis said there was no attempt to blackmail the
Government and his party would behave honourably.
Mr Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said: ''It depends on
the extent to which the present Government meets one criterion we set at
the start of this parliament -- that it should act in the best interests
of the United Kingdom and Northern ireland particularly.
''We will stick to that policy. Over the next couple of years there
will be an election -- it could come sooner rather than later -- but we
are not in the business of blackmail. We made it clear we would behave
honourably -- we do not look at policies to see if we can horse-trade on
particular points.''
Ms Mowlam, he confirmed, had made communications with the Labour Party
''much easier''.
