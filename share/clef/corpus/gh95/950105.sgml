FORMER Labour Transport spokesman Peter Snape is set to make a
''large'' profit from the sale of shares in a privatised bus company,
the Commons was told yesterday. The disclosure was greeted with delight
by Tory MPs.
Mr Snape, MP for West Bromwich East, was mentioned when Tory Henry
Bellingham (Norfolk North-West) said that West Midlands Travel was about
to be floated on the stock market.
It was ''good news'' that all employees would receive free shares, Mr
Bellingham said.
To Tory cries of ''Oh'', he added: ''The directors -- who include
Peter Snape -- will make large profits on their share options.''
A smiling Mr Major said he hoped the flotation would be a great
success.
''I hope Mr Snape does very well out of it, because the privatisation
of the bus services has proved immensely successful for the users of the
bus services,'' he said.
Mr Snape, who became a non-executive director three years ago, was
reported to have rights to aquire 40,000 shares. Currently they are
valued at #1.60 each but could rise to #2 on flotation later this year,
making them worth about #80,000.

* WHEN Anniesland College opened its #60,000 state-of-the-art,
multimedia centre, it showed it meant business.
Mike Newton, managing director Apple UK, was drafted in to carry out
the official opening. And this was no low-tech, ribbon-cutting opening.
Under the conductor's baton of college principal Hugh Walker, the
Apple supremo pressed a mouse to start the equipment, supplied by his
company, blasting forth the computer-generated ''Anthem for
Anniesland'', later presented to him as a framed printout.
''The multimedia centre is a resource that is at the service of the
college and of business,'' says Hugh Walker. ''We now have the
facilities to allow students and business users to make their own CD
ROMs here. All the equipment allows users to learn in the mode that
suits them best.''
The college emphasises its new Apple power is not a tool for
computing. ''We have deliberately situated it within the field of
language and communication,'' says Jim Brady, centre manager. ''We are
keen for students and the business community to view the equipment as a
tool of, and vehicle for, learning.
''It opens up enormous possibilities and we will be delighted to
discuss them with any concern, large or small, which wants to know more
about multimedia.''
The last word goes to Mike Newton: ''Frankly, I was expecting to be
asked to cut a tape. I was delighted that such creative use was made of
the multimedia computers to open the facility.
''I shall keep the framed copy of the music in pride of place in my
office.''

* SO farewell, then, Maurice Saatchi and possibly Charles Saatchi.
Sidelined from the advertising company they founded. And now, Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi must find a new name. In sombre mood, we considered the options
yesterday over coffee in the Nerd House commissariat.
The Braces came up with Trouble &amp; Strife, but this did not seem to
have the positive resonance essential to a major agency. Ms Angelica
Banana-Skyne, the High Whitecraigs polymath, suggested Gravis ira regum
est semper plc (The anger of kings is always serious). But this seemed
cumbersome.
Our best effort was Sacky &amp; Sacky. Cruel but effective, no?
* To the Editor, The Innumerate Nerd.
Sir, -- As an independent salesperson in investment-related life
assurance products, I have started the New Year turning over a new leaf.
I have decided to tell potential marks . . . sorry, clients . . .
absolutely everything about any policy they may be considering, from the
obscure charges previously hidden in the small print to the amount of
commission I would make from the sale. My term for this is ''hard
disclosure''.
Look, I know that ''hard disclosure'' is now insisted upon by new laws
which, coincidentally, came into effect on January 1. But I had already
decided on a frank selling policy as my New Year resolution for 1995.
You must believe this. Don't snigger. Maybe the insurance regulators
heard about my New Year resolution back in June and decided to make it
official. I did talk about it one night in the pub.
But my problem is that the only thing clients really want to know
about, apart from the big final pay-off, is my commission. They put this
question in several ways. The least offensive is: ''That wouldn't be
your midnight-blue Porsche outside in the private parking space, would
it?''
The most offensive is: ''Look, squire, you seem to be doing all right.
What's in this for you, if you get my meaning?'' (Taps side of nose.) I
feel my professional integrity is being questioned just because I happen
to like Porsche engineering and Armani tailoring.
Here's the problem. Since I reopened my modest city-centre office on
Tuesday, and removed the Christmas lights from the cheese-plant, I have
sold absolutely zilch. Yet a score of potential clients have gone away
chuckling, trying to estimate my annual income on their pocket
calculators.
I wouldn't mind this so much if 80% of them didn't happen to be
neighbours, who had no intention of buying a policy in the first place.
Do you have any advice?
Despondent, Glasgow
Dear Despondent, -- Listen, I'm sure that things will settle down.
What you are experiencing is the income disclosure backlash. In your
years as an investment-related life assurance products salesperson, you
must have asked thousands of people how much money they had coming in.
You almost certainly wrote it down on a form.
And whether they bought a policy through you or not, you still have
this sensitive information in your filing cabinet. For all I know, you
might have sold it to a junk mail house.
All that's happening now is that these people are getting their own
back. They will tire of it eventually: but meanwhile, don't be too
surprised if your junk mail count mysteriously increases. As for the
Porsche -- trade downwards or park it elsewhere. As for the Armani suits
-- a coffee-stain on the left lapel might be helpful. As for the cheese
plant -- callers will empathise with you more if it goes blotchy and
yellowish, like theirs.
And yes -- I do believe that you had every intention of introducing
''hard disclosure'' before it became obligatory. You have no idea how
many investment-related life assurance products salespersons have
written to me to tell about their entirely voluntary New Year
resolutions.

MOLE Board's trainer Jim Old has been forced to shut down his yard
because of the effects of a virus.
He is yet to have a winner this season and hasn't sent out a runner
since Collier Bay finished fourth in a handicap hurdle at Cheltenham on
December 9.
All 42 inmates at his Wroughton stables have been infected by an
Equine Herpes virus (EHV1) and are likely to remain in their boxes until
the end of the month at least.
''We have had the virus many times,'' said Old, ''the worst in the 80s
which drove me nearly bankrupt.
''This season, everything was going wrong when we were running them so
we stopped to take stock.
''We've called in the vets, but they can't work miracles -- all they
do is charge you.
''Some of the horses are having a rest and some are doing gentle
exercise.
''We're using all sorts of herbal remedies to help them, but all we
can do is wait -- there is little else you can do.
''We'll have to start from scratch once it has passed. My first runner
back could be Mole Board in the Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham on January
28.''

THE SPECIAL unit set up to investigate possible Nazi war criminals
living in England and Wales may soon be disbanded, nearly a year after
its Scottish counterpart.
Funding for the London-based unit of police and historians ends in
March. It spent nearly three years and #5m on its investigations, but no
prosecutions have yet been forthcoming.
However, Commander Roy Ramm, of Scotland Yard's specialist operations,
said reports of its closure were totally untrue. ''Home Office funding
does end on March 31, but if further funds are required, they will be
subject of consideration by the Metropolitan Police in the new financial
year,'' he said.
Mr Ramm added that the future of the unit would not be determined
until the question of seven prosecutions, currently being considered by
the Crown Prosecution Service, was decided. A CPS spokesman said a final
decision on possible prosecutions would not be made until counsel's
advice, due before the end of the month, was scrutinised.
Mr Jon Mendelsohn, secretary of the all-party parliamentary war crimes
group, said he was optimistic that prosecutions would be forthcoming. He
said the #5m was ''incredible value for money,'' given the cost of
justice and the nature of the inquiries.
The Scottish and English units began investigations after the
controversial War Crimes Act in 1991. It allowed for people who were not
British citizens at the time to be charged with murders committed
abroad.
Six months ago, the Government said the English unit had reviewed 369
cases. Of those, 229 were rejected and 112 suspects had died. At that
stage, 28 people were being investigated, with 10 being considered for
prosecutions.
The Scottish unit, working under the direction of the Crown Office,
spent about #500,000 and visited 10 countries in pursuit of its
inquiries into 17 suspects. It was disbanded last February because of
insufficient evidence for criminal prosecutions.
This stands in contrast to the level of proof in civil cases. Retired
Edinburgh mining engineer Antony Gecas was branded a mass murderer by
Lord Milligan at the end of his unsuccessful libel case in 1992 against
Scottish Television for a programme on his war-time activities in
Lithuania.
Criminal trials abroad relying on evidence of 50-year-old documents
and elderly witnesses have had little success. Australia abandoned the
last of its trials a year ago without any convictions.
The Israeli supreme court dismissed the case of John Demjanjuk when
KGB files showed he was not the death camp guard Ivan the Terrible.

AT LEAST 50% of primary school heads are struggling with their new
role as managers of school budgets.
On-site marketing and budgetary control was introduced after the 1993
Education Act, but involved little training, Dr Robert Stratford, of
Southampton University, told delegates.
Of 120 primary school heads polled, 60% responded and of them half
declared themselves less than convinced with the way the fundamental
change was introduced. Forty per cent did not reply at all, possibly
because they were too busy trying to cope.
Mr Stratford suggested that perhaps those who had successfully made
the transition could be used to give advice and guidance to others.

THE number of business failures can be expected to fall again in this
new year, but the very large number of them in the past three or four
years has focused attention on the need for a ''rescue culture.''
However there are signs that the focus is in danger of being
misdirected.
For the most part companies ultimately fail because of failures by
their management: the management team does not address critical issues
quickly enough. But a belief has arisen that the cause of so many
business failures was neither the recession nor bad management, but a
failure of the insolvency procedures themselves.
Six weeks ago a conference was held in London on the Reform of
Insolvency Law and Company Rescues to discuss responses to a government
consultation paper on further changes in insolvency procedures.
These had included a 28-day moratorium to protect company voluntary
arrangements, introduced a week later in Kenneth Clarke's Budget
statement.
Other proposals in the consultation paper were that holders of a
floating charge, usually the bank, would have to give seven days' notice
of appointing a receiver, during which time the directors could file a
company voluntary arrangement (CVA).
Yet one of the main advantages of receivership is its flexibility and
its capacity for speedy action to safeguard assets. Requiring seven
days' notice of the appointment of a receiver would increase the risk of
assets being dissipated.
The consultation paper suggested that the new procedures should be
subject to a low level of monitoring by an independent party, who need
not to be an insolvency practitioner. This would be unlikely to prevent
the dissipation of assets.
It would take only one or two bad experiences of this sort to make the
procedure unworkable.
The paper asked for views on whether the right of a floating charge
holder should be removed and whether the Crown preference should be
removed. While the Crown preference might be safely removed, taking away
the rights of floating charge holders would undoubtedly change bank
lending policy. This would make finance less readily available and more
costly.
In the short term, as banks take steps to protect their position, it
could even result in an increase in the number of insolvencies.
The proposals are to be amended and re-issued for consultation, along
with a proposal from three academics for a system of automatically
swopping debt for equity. Although those working in the field regarded
their ideas as far too theoretical, it has attracted Kenneth Clarke's
attention.
Ironically, apart from the government, all parties at the conference
-- including insolvency practitioners, bankers, lawyers, the Institute
of Directors, and academics -- agreed that existing insolvency
procedures worked fairly well and needed only minor amendment.
The general view was that the proposals were fairly radical and were a
knee-jerk reaction to the recent high numbers of business failures.
An earlier attempt to legislate a rescue culture into existence was
the 1986 Insolvency Act. It attempted to replicate the American Chapter
11 procedure by introducing Administration Orders.
These turned out not to be widely used for a number of reasons, among
them cost and a lack of understanding, but principally because they were
no better than receivership.
Attempts to introduce American-style procedures are misguided because
they confuse exactly what it is we should be rescuing. It is not
necessarily the company that should be saved: it is the business, and
the jobs that go with the business.
Statistical evidence shows that fewer than 20% of businesses survive
the American Chapter 11 procedure, while about 50% of businesses emerge
from receiverships, covering up to 85% of the jobs involved.
One of the reasons is that the American procedure leaves the company
in the hands of the existing directors. If the cause of company failures
is poor management, is it wise to leave the company in the hands of that
management?
Under receivership the business and its assets are put under the
control of an independent party. Receivers try to sell the business as a
going concern to maximise the return to the creditors.
It is the survival of the business which matters, not the company. If
there is a viable business there, receivership is an efficient and
effective way to ensure its survival or alternatively to prevent it from
soaking up more creditors' money if it is not. The existing procedures
do not needlessly destroy sound, viable businesses.
The banks are too often criticised for failing to support companies,
largely because failures are public, whereas the banks are seldom
credited for helping companies to survive: because of the confidential
nature of these rescues they don't hit the headlines.
If we are to encourage a ''rescue culture'', we need a cultural change
rather than a legislative change. Directors and management teams need to
be encouraged to seek professional advice and assistance at an early
stage before problems become critical.
They need to be persuaded to seek help at the earliest possible stage
without being driven into a defensive posture which might lead them to
ignore or cover up deteriorating situations.
Perhaps keeping the cultural change required involves all of us, in
that we should give credit to managements who do seek much assistance
early. A rescue culture cannot be legislated into existence: like all
cultures, it has to be grown.

* WHISKY, often described as ''the water of life'', is reckoned to
improve with age and the same often goes for the real stuff -- H2O.
For pure Scottish water is often stored in its natural underground
vault for 30 to 50 years before it ends up in a bottle.
Sandy Scott, director of sales for Strathmore Mineral Water, says the
water his company draws from its 550ft-deep well on the outskirts of
Forfar is at least 30 years old.
''At present we are taking water from rocks about 370ft to 380ft
down,'' says Sandy, ''which means it is more than 30 years since it fell
as rain. It has spent all that time being purified.''
Sandy spent 20 years in the wine trade before starting to sell the
''natural stuff'' six years ago.
In that time there has been a tremendous upsurge in bottled-water
sales and Strathmore is now selling 1.7 million cases a year compared to
about 200,000 then.
Despite his lengthy spell in the wine trade Sandy can claim to have
his roots firmly in Scotland's natural asset as his father, James A B
Scott, was chief engineer of South-east of Scotland Water Board from
1957-70.
''During my youth I spent every weekend at reservoirs and filtration
plants, so I know something about water,'' he says.
The source of Strathmore Water is the Glen of Kirriemuir, and despite
Scotland's heavy rainfall Sandy points out that only about 3% of the
water which falls eventually reaches down to the level from which water
companies draw their pure supplies.
He is in no doubt why bottled-water sales have risen so dramatically.
''There is a growth in the mistrust of municipal supplies,'' he says.
''And there is also the fact that people drink bottled water while on
holiday, and the habit sticks when they come back.''

George Reynolds meets an
enthusiastic golf-club maker
IN the world of golf it is not unknown for people to turn their hobby
into a livelihood. That is just what Allan Askings has done in the
unlikely setting of Grantown-on-Spey.
He has done it not because of his prowess on the links (although he
does boast a respectable single-figure handicap) but because of his
enormous enthusiasm for golf, for golf clubs in general, and for woods
in particular.
In a small factory in Grantown's Strathspey Industrial Estate, Allan
and two others earn their living from the Highland Golf Company which is
dedicated to producing classic hand-finished woods.
These are clubs for the player who spurns the mass-produced metal
heads with carbon etc shafts. The Highlander Classic woods have
persimmon heads, face insert, base plate, steel shaft, and leather
grips.
The head arrives roughly shaped at Grantown-on-Spey and it takes two
weeks to turn it into a glistening wood which would grace any bag.
Each head is individually shaped and cut, then hand smoothed, stained,
and given three coats of paint.
''I have always had an interest in golf,'' says Edinburgh-born Allan.
''In the late 70s I went to Australia and as a manager for golf
professionals quickly learned all about golf club specification. Later I
ran a golf driving range and again learned quickly how to repair
clubs.''
On his return to Scotland five years ago his club repair knowledge was
widely called upon, and when he was offered the opportunity to buy the
wood-making equipment from the Wilson factory at Troon he decided to
turn his hobby into his living.
''It took nine months of trial and error to produce woods which I
would put on the market, but I am now one of only two manufacturers of
wood 'woods' in Scotland,'' he says.
The Highland Golf Company also produces presentation and personalised
putters with hickory shaft, persimmon head, and suede grip -- and is
linking up with other local industries, notably whisky, in joint
promotions of what Speyside has to offer.
Although the company makes metal woods with carbon shafts, and irons,
and continues to repair and renovate clubs, the cornerstone of the
business is wood.
So much so that Allan Askings already has approval in principle from
Highland Regional council to convert the two-acre site of the former
primary school at Duthil, one mile from Carr Bridge on the Grantown
road, into a wood-based craft centre.
''The scheme has the support of Highland Opportunities and Moray
Badenoch and Strathspey Enterprise,'' he says.
''It is a five/six year plan which could cost up to #200,000. The club
manufacturing will move from Grantown into a purpose-built workshop and
be the core activity at the new centre.
''Future phases would include a golf-themed museum, a shop, tearoom,
children's playground, putting green, and even a practice chipping area
complete with bunker.
''Speyside is extremely popular with visitors, both British and
overseas, who come to enjoy the peace and beauty of the Highlands, the
malt whisky trail, salmon fishing on the Spey, and the other
attractions.
''The multi-faceted wood-based craft centre will add to these
attractions, as well as providing employment and producing up to 50
classic individual woods a week.''

A new factory in Morayshire is
proving an early success and, says
Bill Mowat, the idea came in a flash
THE Northern Lights are burning brightly for Scots-born businessman
George Martin, who has just opened a new manufacturing plant in Forres,
Morayshire.
But it was pure chance which gave him the idea for the product of his
Highland Lighting Industries Ltd factory on the town's Greshop
Industrial Estate.
Dundee-born George, 54, spent most of his business life in the West
Midlands, running a Coventry-based general-engineering workshop. But as
the recession began to hit the area he knew he had to find a new product
to manufacture.
One day he drove his car for a service at a local garage and he
chatted to the mechanic who suggested: ''Why don't you consider making a
decent inspection lamp for our trade?''
He looked into the idea, checked out the available product-range, and
agreed that the garage hand had a point.
Now after 18 months designing and testing prototypes -- and an
investment of #80,000 -- his H L I business is up and running, while his
engineering business in Coventry has been put on the market.
Since the summer start-up the company's workforce has grown to nine.
He expects the current output of 700 lamps a week to rise quite sharply,
with employment likely to rise to 15 before too long and maybe to 20
within 12 months.
The lamp is manufactured to British Standards 5750 and meets the EC
9000 quality controls. The product is selling well to motor-factors'
outlets throughout the UK, with the first export order off to Europe
just recently and a major contract from America ''under negotiation''.
The inspection lamps are designed to run on low-voltage (12v or 24v)
specifications, which are now mandatory in most of Europe and will be
shortly within the UK.
Martin plumped on Forres as a manufacturing base as it is near his
house in Ballindalloch, Banffshire.
''After I had investigated the original suggestion I quickly found
that what I had been told made sense,'' he says. ''But a great deal of
effort went into the design and it was not finalised before field-trials
were held. Now I believe that the production specifications for the H L
I lamps are superior to any other on the market selling in the #20 to
#25 price range.''
With the sole exception of a small part, a German-made bulb-holder,
all the components are sourced from the UK, as is the 22ft of heavy-duty
cable supplied with each lamp.
Now with negotiations going on with a California-based distributor,
and with distribution networks in Britain and Europe, George is hoping
that, like his famous Beatles-producer namesake, he is heading for
worldwide success.

''As far as the national
landmarks to mark the
millennium are concerned, we
are, potentially, talking of
structures each carrying price
tags of #100m or more. Serious
money. Serious structures.''
THESE days Saturday evenings embody a tense new ritual. Millions up
and down the land now try to match the numbers on seven balls spat out
by the National Lottery's plastic wind tunnel with those on tickets
clutched expectantly in their hands.
But, even if a personal Lottery fortune continues to elude you, as it
does most of us, there are other ways to capture a -- shall we say, more
collective? -- slice of all this action.
You and your friends can come up with a scheme to mark the end of the
second millennium and the start of the third and, if it wins the support
of the Millennium Commission, your idea could end up with backing of up
to #50m, funded entirely from Lottery takings.
But you'd better be quick. First-round proposals are being accepted
right now. The Millennium Commission's deadline for receiving proposal
forms is March 31. Its deadline for firm applications is April 30.
The first grants could be paid out as early as this October. If you
miss these deadlines, your idea will not be considered until next year's
second application round.
Just before Christmas I participated in a small group discussion,
convened by Scottish Enterprise chairman Professor Donald MacKay,
exploring ways of marking the millennium which would produce real
economic benefits for this and succeeding generations of Scots.
Being creative to order is never easy. We thrashed around known
third-party schemes and a few pet hobby horses of our own. We surveyed
some wide blue sky. But, for a small sample of a nation said to be
thirled to dependency, we found spending up to #50m of other people's
money damnably difficult.
The rules laid down by the Millennium Commission compound those
difficulties. By the year 2000 the Commission, as one of five good
causes supported equally by the Lottery, could have between #1200m and
#1600m to spend.
It intends to allocate around half that total to a dozen or so major
capital projects across the United Kingdom, so-called national landmarks
for the twentyfirst century. It seems to interpret that word landmark
pretty literally. Its brochure is littered with references to site
visits, construction, and architectural quality, although there is also
the occasional reference to environmental projects.
As far as Stephen Dorrell, Michael Heseltine, the Earl of Dalkeith,
Simon Jenkins, and the other commissioners are concerned, we are clearly
talking bricks and mortar, steel and concrete, marble and glass, or some
such combination. Each chosen landmark will get between #10m and #50m in
Millennium Commission funding.
But only if the project would not have happened otherwise, through the
everyday expenditure of public money. And only if the project falls
outside the scope of the other four Lottery-supported good causes --
arts projects; sports projects; national heritage projects; and
charitable expenditure. And only if so-called partnership contributions
-- from the private or voluntary sectors, from local authorities,
Government programmes, Europe or wherever -- make up at least half the
total budget.
So, as far as the national landmarks to mark the millennium are
concerned, we are, potentially, talking of structures each carrying
price tags of #100m or more. Serious money. Serious structures.
The Commission also insists they enjoy public support, make a
substantial contribution to the life of the communities they are
designed to serve, look back over the past millennium or forward to the
next, and will be seen by future generations as marking a significant
moment in national or local history.
As if that wasn't a big enough task with which to tax the
post-Ne'erday grey matter, the Millennium Commission also intends to
support a wide range of smaller capital projects of more local
significance. The same general rules apply. But this time the
Commission's pound-for-pound support is limited to the range #100,000 up
to #15m. Again, first-round applications are invited now.
A number of Scottish landmark projects are already in the frame,
ranging from the reconstruction of the Forth-Clyde canal to the
replanting of parts of the old Caledonian pine forest. A new University
of the Highlands jostles with perennial favourites like a Scottish
national stadium, a national theatre, or even a national science centre,
the favoured centrepiece of the Glasgow Development Agency's preferred
plans for the site of the former Garden Festival.
The backers of the rival Tivoli-style gardens for that Clydeside site
are also targeting Millennium cash. And there is even a proposal to
build an entirely new -- and this time permanent -- Scottish garden on a
grand scale elsewhere in the Central Belt.
Sincere backers of many of these competing proposals will doubtless
argue that theirs offers powerful economic spin-offs -- as a major new
tourist attraction, as part of the burgeoning arts industry, or as
further underpinning of our national effort to educate future
generations more effectively than we have generations past.
In our small group there were passionate pleas to use the money to
help Scotland look forward with confidence, not backwards with our
unquenchable appetite for nostalgia. No monuments. Rather tools to help
us make a better fist of the twentyfirst century than we have of much of
the twentieth.
Some of us wondered whether the Commission's preferred structural
approach is the right one for a new millennium when the intangible
information superhighway may prove ultimately more potent than the
blacktop road network of today.
We toyed with ideas of linking every Scottish school, college and
university with fibre optic cable to better prepare this country for
that silicon future. But, truth to tell, we found it hard to come
together on a single project which would both meet the Commission's
stated criteria and contribute effectively to Scotland's future economic
prosperity.
I was struck, during our deliberations, by how little real public
debate there has been on how to celebrate the millennium and how to
spend the promised money. The Commission has held a series of
consultation meetings in 15 UK cities.
It says it has heard the views of more than 600 people from business,
local government, the cultural, educational and voluntary sectors, and
further consulted more than 80 public bodies and specialist
organisations.
But that hardly adds up to a wide-ranging public debate. So, rather
than shove one of my hobby horses down your throat, dear reader, let's
hear what you think. It is not too late for a really good idea, a
Lottery win for all Scots everywhere.

SCOTTISH cereal farmers could be on the verge of an unexpected capital
windfall, according to some sources.
This view is based on the fact that the European Union has now relaxed
the rules on set-aside, which allows farmers to transfer acres between
holdings within a tight set of regulations.
In the dairy farming sector, the advent of quotas over 10 years ago
has seen some farmers discover that their quota is now worth more than
the value of the farm. This is unlikely to be the situation in the
arable sector, but only time will tell.
Before anyone imagines that they might get rich fast, they should
consider the regulations very carefully. The Department of Agriculture
has just issued a publication laying out the do's and don'ts.
This makes it clear that any transfers must be made within a 20km
radius, or into a designated environmental target area -- which might
well include Nitrate Sensitive Areas, or land adjoining Sites of Special
Scientific Interest.
The options offered present obvious opportunities for the intensive
arable farmer to transfer his obligatory 12% set-aside further up the
hill to farmers who are content to take an easier life, but those
importing set-aside acres should bear in mind that they must up their
area by 3%.
Again, if the transfer is to a region with a lower reference yield --
as in an exchange between non-LFA and LFA -- an adjustment must be made
by the importer to increase the area.
The rules are fairly straight forward, but point out that transfers
must involve only one or two recipient parties. Specifically, if a
farmer decides to export only part of his set-aside, then it can only go
to one producer.
Again, should that farmer prefer to transfer all of his set-aside,
then it has to go to a maximum of two holdings. The Department are
demanding that farmers engaged in transfers provide full documentation
of the participants.
The rules relating to the 20km radius are similarly precise, in that
all measures must be calculated on a straight line basis, using the farm
house or steading as the axis, and that at least some part of the border
of the plot transferred must fall within the designated 20km.
Already, in the farming press, advertisements are appearing on behalf
of recognised quota brokers. However, according to Francis Mordaunt of
the consultancy firm David Anderson and Co., there are likely to be more
people seeking to import set-aside than to export.
He commented: ''There are inherent dangers in this scheme, in that
everything has to be absolutely watertight. Any mistakes could result in
individuals losing out on some, or even all, of their IACS payments.
Personally, having consulted with some of our leading clients, we will
not touch transfers with a barge pole.''
The NFU have been looking at the situation, and have prepared a
briefing, which concludes; ''Before entering into transfer agreement it
is essential that producers set out the terms of transfer in writing,
including compensation by the importer should any of the rules be
broken.''

* NOT many businesses are launched as a result of an industrial
dispute, but Mercat Tours is an exception.
Ten years ago history teacher Des Brogan found he had time on his
hands because of the Scotland-wide EIS dispute which disrupted teachers'
extra-curricular activities.
Before the dispute he had been taking his history pupils around
Edinburgh's Royal Mile and had been dismayed at the ''absolute
nonsense'' he overheard tourist guides tell their clients. He contacted
three history-teacher friends and they formed their own guide tour
company, Mercat Tours.
Des has no difficulty remembering when they launched the business:
''It was on July 1, 1985 the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme,''
he says.
''We didn't get a single customer for the first three days, and I was
over the moon when an old lady and her daughter turned up on the fourth
day for a tour.''
The two customers have grown to 20,000-plus and Mercat Tours now
operates all year round.
''At first we operated only in the summer but now we never stop,'' he
says. ''On New Year's Day we catered for nearly 200 people on two
separate tours.''
Des, who is principal history teacher at Holy Rood school in
Edinburgh, no longer takes tours himself but handles the administration
of the company while his colleague Alan Wilson, principal teacher at
James Gillespie High School, looks after the finances.
The other two history teachers originally involved have retired.
Mercat Tours uses either history graduates, or university students
studying history, as its guides.
''We have about 20 guides we can call on,'' says Des, ''and many are
former pupils of ours. They have all studied Scottish history and tell
people only actual facts. If they do not know the answer to a question
then they tell people where the answer can be found.''
Mercat now offers two separate tours, one of Edinburgh's Royal Mile
and the other an evening Ghost and Ghouls tour.
''The ghosts are certainly the most popular,'' says Des, ''During the
summer we run three of these tours each evening.''
Every nationality turns up on the tours, and Des can tell each
country's peak holiday period through the make-up of his parties.
''Just now we mostly have Australians and New Zealanders as this is
their holiday period at home,'' he says, ''while in April and May we
have a lot of French and Spanish, with the Americans turning up at the
height of our summer.''
No matter the nationality, the favourite ghost tale is that of Johnny
One Arm, who in the seventeenth century murdered a High Court judge in
Advocate's Close. The name is explained by the fact that Johnny's
executioner cut off the arm with which he had fired the gun.
Johnny is said to haunt the Close, and there have been reports of
gunfire being heard . . .

The founder of the Smiley car-parts operation
tells Jack Webster how he turned over a new
leaf and saw a boyhood dream come true
SCOTLAND'S latest bookseller, Bill Fleming, tells a good story from
those days of the early sixties when he was running his own Beat Scene
magazine and helping to organise pop concerts in Glasgow. A new group
was on the bill one night when he answered the backstage phone to
someone who wanted to speak to a John Lennon.
''I don't know anyone called John Lennon,'' said Bill. He's with a
group called The Beatles, said the voice.
''So I went to the dressing-room and said: 'Which one of you is John
Lennon?' Can you imagine it now!''
Bill Fleming has been learning fast ever since, all the way to the
heights of a multi-millionaire, as the man who created the Smiley chain
of fast-fit depots for motorists, 75 of them stretching from Inverness
to Crewe.
Two years ago, however, he sold out for many millions and pursued a
boyhood dream. As the working-class son of a joiner in Hamilton, Bill
left school at 16 and went to work as a labourer on the nearby estate of
the Duke of Hamilton.
''I got lost one day and suddenly found myself looking across the Avon
Gorge at an astonishing series of terraced gardens, with all kinds of
flowers and plants, including orchids,'' he told me.
''But what caught my eye most were the palm trees -- in Hamilton! I
had been born and brought up here and I didn't know this place existed.
Most people in Hamilton don't know of it even now. I thought I would
love to own something like that one day.''
WHAT Bill Fleming was seeing were the ancient gardens of Barncluith
House, the sixteenth-century mansion with its splendid tower dating well
before that. Never losing sight of his dream, he came to know the owners
during his rise to business fortune and made known his interest, if the
house ever came on the market.
Coinciding with the sale of his Smiley empire, he received a phone
call which gave him the first chance to buy his dream home of
Barncluith. He and his wife Sandra moved into the 12-acre estate and
Bill decided to devote himself to the restoration of the gardens.
From his splendid home, he could look back on a remarkable career
which first saw him falter in the exams to be a cost works accountant
before he started a business of his own, spotting an opening for that
magazine covering the Beat Scene.
It was a precarious life which took a turn for the better when he
received the one and only telegram of his life. It came from a man
called T V Shields, who was starting the pop pirate ship Radio Scotland
and wanted a magazine to go along with it.
''That was how I came to produce 242 Showbeat,'' he recalls. ''I was
making money, and had a West End flat and a white E-type Jaguar which
played Colonel Bogey on the horn! I was the kind of young man I wouldn't
want to know today.''
All that came to an end when the Government outlawed advertising on
the pirate ships and Bill Fleming withdrew to the respectability of the
Herald advertising department. By nature, however, he was a
self-employing man.
IT was back to magazines, this time to the self-explanatory What's On,
with Fleming anxious to extend that to something which would have been
new to Scotland -- a free weekly newspaper. His partner disagreed and
bought him out for #600.
The main phase of his career sprang from the fact that he had always
tinkered with motor cars. Settling for marriage and a steadier life, he
rented a small garage in Uddingston, doing repairs, running a taxi, and
acting as fitter for a tyre shop across the road.
When that shop went out of business, Fleming supplied the tyres
himself and tumbled on the idea of concentrating on specific items like
tyres and exhausts. Unknown to him another Scottish entrepreneur, Tom
Farmer of Edinburgh, had struck on exactly the same idea and was
starting to build up his Kwik-Fit chain.
When Fleming opened his third centre, on the Edinburgh road, it was
still known by its previous name of Smellie's. He decided to change the
smell to a smile -- and that was how the Smiley chain gained its name,
established in 1969 and growing over the next 20 years to a turnover of
#25m.
He resisted attempts of people such as Tom Farmer to buy him out but,
in 1989 he sold a third of his business for #3.25m to Continental AG of
Hanover, better known in Scotland as Uniroyal of Newbridge.
Three years later he sold the rest of Smiley's to the same company and
moved out of the headquarters, which were situated on the very site,
near Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary, from which Mary Queen of Scots
watched the Battle of Langside.
Moving out to his newly-acquired mansion, he was to discover that the
early owner of Barncluith, Sheriff Quentin Hamilton, was killed while
fighting for Mary at that same battle. Extending coincidence, Bill
Fleming also discovered that those magnificent gardens which so
intrigued him as a lad had once been rented to nurseryman John Naismith,
one of his own ancestors!
So he settled to the restoration of Barncluith, employed a leading
horticulturalist, but soon found that the itch of the entrepreneur was
calling him back to business.
How, though, does the creator of Smiley's become Scotland's latest
bookseller? Bill Fleming had been an avid reader long before he
published those early magazines. Now with millions to spare, he ran into
another of life's coincidences.
At Glasgow Airport one day he bumped into an old school friend, Mike
Miller, who said he was in the process of selling off Blackie, the
Bishopbriggs publisher, of which he was chairman. He was going into
business with two former employees of Collins the publishers, David
Geddes and Ron Grosset, who had started up in New Lanark.
''I said I might be interested in investing in such a company and
asked him to keep in touch,'' says Fleming. ''It so happened that Geddes
and Grosset had run into some bother with a book distributor in America
and had lost #400,000 as a result.
''But the business survived and when Mike Miller, who is an
accountant, felt it was organised and re-financed, I put money into it.
We moved into children's books and reference books and gained a good
tie-up with Time-Life. Geddes and Grosset will have produced between
nine and ten million books this past year, including a children's series
which has sold 2.5 million copies in the past 18 months.''
Bill Fleming suggested they should separate the publishing from the
distributing side, the latter becoming Bothwell Bridge Book Company, in
which he and his wife Sandra have a 50% stake.
But he wasn't finished yet. As a regular browser in bookshops, he had
always felt books were too expensive. On the one hand there were the
major stores, with their minimum price agreement, and on the other the
bargain shops which never seemed to have enough titles available.
Bill Fleming decided to strike between those two positions and, in
1994, launched his Tower Bookshop company, named after the main feature
of his Barncluith estate. Within months he has established three shops,
at Newton Mearns, Paisley, and Glasgow's Union Street.
It is a company kept within the Fleming family, with his wife Sandra
running the Newton Mearns bookshop and daughters Alison and Susan
working in the other two.
SURVEYING the Lanarkshire landscape from his office at Bothwell Bridge
he says: ''Altogether this is a nicer business than the motor trade.''
Not that he hasn't had his problems.
A decision to break the price agreement landed him in trouble with the
Publishers' Association. It was refusing to supply him so, in that
respect at least, he has now had to toe the line. But Fleming's
ingenuity has found ways of buying remaindered copies and re-prints, in
a bid to lower the price.
So is this the beginning of another huge enterprise, applying the kind
of business philosophy which will give us a Smiley's of the book world?
Bill Fleming leans back and laughs: ''I would like to spread to places
like Aberdeen, Dundee, and Edinburgh and to towns which are short of
bookshops like Airdrie, Coatbridge, and Falkirk. Scotland will do for a
start!''
Outwith books, he has invested his wealth in small, unquoted private
firms like the bicycle shop company Discount Bike World.
Away from it all, he drives around in his Mercedes and had his first
Californian holiday in September, visiting the Queen Mary at Long Beach.
All that and the home of his boyhood dreams -- out there among the palm
trees of sunny Hamilton.

WITH over 55% of the current wool clip sold, and steady demand, the
British Wool Marketing Board starts the new year well on sales target --
and confident of a sustained market.
Hopes are high for the two January sales, which usually produce strong
competition and good clearances. The Scottish sale next week is expected
to be particularly attractive to buyers, as it will offer the first
Blackface wool since the middle of November, when prices for these
grades ranged from 105p to 113p a kg.
Around 25 million kilos of an estimated total clip of 47 million kilos
has already been sold, and with world stockpiles falling -- and smaller
clips from all major producing countries -- the outlook for wool prices
is very encouraging.
In Australia, the effects of drought have produced lighter weight and
finer fleeces on a reduced sheep population, and it is estimated that
25% of this year's clip will be 19 micron, or finer.
The New Zealand clip, although coarser than Australian wool, will be
of a reduced weight, and there is likely to be demand for British wool
to fill the gap in equivalent qualities.
Meanwhile, China is firmly back in the market, and a sizeable order
for cross and Half-bred wools has had a bearing on recent British wool
sales, with prices for these types averaging 126p a kg.
Richard Netherwood, the Board's technical-marketing director, stated
yesterday: ''The outlook for 1995 is very promising. Demand for natural
fibres is good, and with limited supplies of British wool now available,
the Board can no longer be regarded as a stockholder.
''We are in our strongest marketing position for some time.''
Members of Dumfries and Stewartry Area NFU yesterday urged the Board
to become more efficient, and cut costs -- but they supported the way
the Board was operating at the present time.
They were told by NFU headquarters representative Alastair Nelson that
the future for wool at the present time was very good, and that trade
was bouyant. Two years ago, wool was 20% below what had been the average
figure, but now it was 37% over the average.
Area president Alan Campbell said the general feeling was that, while
the merchants could tighten things up and make themselves more
efficient, the Board was doing a good job.
Areas throughout the country had been asked to respond, by the end of
January, to a paper which the Department of Agriculture had put out to
review the Wool Board.
William Davidson, Moffat, said that basically it asked if they wanted
the Wool Board in its present form, and the payment system with the 50%
in advance, and the other 50% next year.
Members were being asked if they were happy with the Board at present,
any changes they wanted, and whether the Wool Growers should still be
tied to it. He added that marketing costs had come down from 33p per
kilo in 1990, to about 18p at present.

THE marketing campaign for the sale of the Government's remaining
stake in the English electricity generators, National Power and
PowerGen, begins formally next week and brokers are busy reviewing
prospects for the ''GenCos'' with the overall view being one of
optimism.
BZW has produced a circular with a clear buy message for both shares.
As the securities house, along with Kleinwort Benson, is the global
co-ordinator for the offer this is perhaps hardly surprising but other
brokers are unlikely to find much fault with the recommendation.
The actual offer will proceed next month and will follow the familiar
path, except it is planned to inject more competition into the process
to generate the best possible price for the Treasury.
At least 40% of the shares on offer will be available to small
investors, who will benefit from obtaining a discount to the
institutional price and payment spread over three instalments.
In advance of the sale, GenCo shares have underperformed the market
over the past month, which BZW feels is unjustified given the small
discount of their yield to the market average and the companies'
dividend outlook. National Power is expected to pay 18% more this year
and PowerGen 21% more.
Dividend paying ability will be enhanced by the proposed buyback of 8%
of their shares directly from the Government, subject to 1[1/2]%
clawback if retail demand is strong. The companies have confirmed their
dividend strategies, with National Power expecting its cover to be 2.5
times within two years and PowerGen going for between 2.5 and 2.7 times
''in the coming years''.
The GenCos can well afford to buy the shares given their strong net
cash positions, reflecting powerful cash flow and a fall in capital
spending.
National Power's spending is already down to the level of depreciation
and beyond the current year PowerGen's spending is likely to be below
depreciation. BZW believes both companies will have surplus cash over
all foreseeable investment needs of #700m in the period to 1997-98.
However, the securities house does not think the companies are merely
dividend cows. It projects annual growth in earnings per share of 10%,
through a combination of cost savings, new earnings streams from gas and
international operations, new generating plants coming on stream, lower
fuel costs and economic recovery boosting sales.
This is all very well but there is a major cloud on the horizon in the
shape of political risk. The Labour Party is pledged to be tougher on
the privatised utilities, through imposing an excess profits tax which
will undoubtedly be popular with the electorate.
BZW takes comfort from the absence of a specific reference to the
GenCos in Labour's policy statement in November, which did refer to
other utilities.
This appears to be clutching at straws but the key point is how
''excess profits'' are defined and it is possible the GenCos' profits
will not be seen as excessive, given current cost rates return of 8% at
the moment.
By the time the next election is called the GenCos will have further
developed their overseas businesses and may be able to point to the
success they are achieving for Britain in this field.
The other prong of a Labour attack would be through the electricity
regulator whose terms of reference could be altered to take more account
of consumers rather than shareholders who have done well out of all the
utilities.
However, the election could be two years away yet and is sufficiently
in the distance not to have much of an impact on the forthcoming sale
which will no doubt go off smoothly and the shares could show strength
once it is out of the way.
The part-paid shares could be an interesting if volatile short-term
investment given the gearing they will offer and their higher yield
until the final payment comes round.

EDINBURGH Investment Trust, one of the biggest in the UK with gross
assets of more than #1100m, has changed its sector classification to
reflect more accurately its portfolio.
Formerly classed as an ''International-General'' trust, EIT will now
be listed under the ''UK-General'' category of the Association of
Investment Trust Companies.
''We decided the time was ripe to formalise the change in our
investment policy as our performance was being compared with trusts that
had more than half their assets invested abroad,'' explained Ian Massie
of Dunedin, the company's fund managers.
For the past two or three years, EIT has held more than 80% of its
portfolio in the UK where it sees market conditions are best suited to
its aims. These are the achievement of capital growth at a higher rate
than the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index and dividend growth above the
rate of UK inflation.
''Our long-term strategy was that the domestic market offered the best
value and thus comparisons with international trusts were becoming
increasingly irrelevant,'' Mr Massie added. Until 1992, EIT had a rough
average of 40% of its assets abroad.
He also acknowleged that the FTSE weekly sub-division of investment
trust categories, which started only this year, played a part in the
decision as investors will now be given a more detailed breakdown of the
sector.
From being number two behind Foreign &amp; Colonial in the
''International-General'' sector, EIT will head the list of its new home
category.
With more than 89% of its portfolio in the UK, the company has no
trouble in meeting the 80% requirement of the association's listing and
the fund managers do not foresee any major changes in the future.
''We may well go completely domestic as far as assets are concerned
though the current foreign mix of 11% split between the US, Japan,
Europe and emerging markets suits us for the moment,'' Mr Massie added.
In its last results, EIT met its inflation target but failed to
achieve its hoped-for capital growth.
While a 3.4% increase in interim dividend to 3.05p was announced --
compared to the 2.2% inflation rate -- net asset value per share dipped
by 4.5% to 326.6p. The All-Share fell only 3.3%.
Gearing of more than 7% in equities and 12% in bonds was blamed for
the decline, as such a high level exaggerated the downward movements in
the trust's portfolio.
But equally this level of borrowing works in the opposite direction
when markets are turning upwards, a process Edinburgh is confident will
start sooner rather than later.

BRITAIN'S biggest building society, the Halifax, says there was a
small rise in house prices in December, according to its House Price
Index but the underlying trend remains broadly flat and is expected to
remain so for some months.
It bears out the findings of both the Nationwide and the Council Of
Mortgage Lenders with the latter, of which both the Halifax and
Nationwide are members, last week suggesting that it would be 1996
before any meaningful recovery in house prices can be expected.
However, next week sees publication of the final quarter Halifax
breakdown of house price movements and it will be interesting to see if
Scotland continues to buck the trend.
For the third quarter, reported in October, the Scottish house price
figures from the Halifax were reasonably encouraging with average prices
up by 0.7% and by 3.4% in the 12-month period. This contrasted with the
UK position which showed a static performance in the quarter and a
further fall of 0.7% for the year.
Moreover, further analysis indicated that in most of the principal
housing areas in Scotland -- Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen --
almost without exception, the majority of categories of houses had
increased in value over the 12 months to end-September. There was a
half-point increase in base rates in September and this was followed by
a further half-point hike in December to 6.25%.
The figures for Scotland for the last quarter of 1994 should show
whether this, along with Budget changes in income support and increased
taxes are having any adverse impact on the Scottish housing market since
the third quarter.
Meanwhile, the Halifax says that house prices in the UK rose by 0.3%
(seasonally adjusted) in December compared to a small fall of 0.1% in
November. On an annual basis, the rate of house price inflation is minus
0.2%.
The society expects house prices nationally to remain broadly at their
current level for some months given low levels of consumer confidence,
but they should show some small recovery later in 1995 in line with the
recovery in the UK economy as a whole.
From April this year tax relief on mortgage interest will be further
reduced to 15% and the additional restrictions on state support for
mortgage payments to people out of work recently imposed by the
Government will further delay any significant housing market recovery,
says the Halifax.

MERLONI Domestic Appliances, whose Merloni parent in Italy makes
Indesit and Scholtes white goods, has purchased New World Domestic
Appliances, a market leader in gas appliances in the UK, for #12.6m.
New World, which had been making losses in recent years, was acquired
from Blue Circle for clients of venture capital house Murray Johnstone
and turnaround specialists Horne Roberts in August 1994.
The end of 1994 saw the company trading profitably with a substantial
uplift in orders as a result of more efficient production from a
business with significantly reduced overheads.
Commenting on the sale, Murray Johnstone director Jonathan Diggines
said: ''The turnaround of New World was carefully planned well in
advance of August 1994. Following the purchase we achieved our plans for
increased efficiency faster than we had expected.
''The timing of the approach from Merloni was also unexpected. We were
prepared to sell to them because of their commitment to the New World
brand and to manufacture locally in Warrington.''

MOTORS and marketing group Inchcape yesterday said it had sold most of
its US insurance operations to Indianapolis-based Acordia for around
$50m.
The deal, rumoured on Wall Street on Tuesday, comprises the commercial
retail broking business and employee benefits activities of US
subsidiary Bain Hogg Robinson.
It was first mooted at the end of September, when the two firms also
revealed talks regarding a strategic global alliance. ''These
discussions are continuing,'' Inchcape said.
Inchcape bought Hogg Robinson in a #177m deal last May, merging it
with its own Bain Clarkson to create Bain Hogg, Britain's largest retail
insurance broker and the seventh-largest worldwide with #260m of total
revenue.
At the time, analysts thought a possible future flotation of the whole
operation to be on the cards. Inchcape had also long harboured an intent
to expand in the United States, where Hogg Robinson had a presence, but
the Acordia talks marked a change of direction from going it alone.
An Inchcape spokeswoman said the sale was the first step towards a
wider alliance expected to be announced in the first half of 1995,
involving a 50/50 joint venture to help both firms service sizeable
broking deals.
''The combination of Acordia and Bain Hogg Robinson creates a stronger
company in the United States. Acordia is one of the fastest-growing and
most dynamic brokers over there already. The alliance is still very much
on the cards,'' the spokeswoman said.
Acordia is involved in managed healthcare administration and
consultancy services as well as insurance broking, with total pro-forma
revenues of about $365m in 1993.
It is strong particularly in the South and Mid-West regions of the US
and in employee benefits, but has recently expanded in property and
casualty insurance by acquisition.
New York analysts do not expect the deal, which brings $60m of annual
broking revenue, to dilute Acordia's earnings.
Inchcape is the world's largest independent motor distributor, with
strong links with Japanese carmaker Toyota and strengths firmly in the
Far East and Europe. It is also strong in shipping, product marketing,
sourcing and testing and, via Bain Hogg, provides risk management and
insurance services to firms and individuals around the world. -- Reuter.

THE Bank of Spain yesterday took the bull by the horns with an
earlier-than-expected interest rate increase to pre-empt inflationary
pressures ahead.
The Bank rejected bids at yesterday's regular repurchase tender for
central bank certificates, calling a special auction later in the
morning where the rate was raised to 8% from 7.35%.
Markets reacted calmly to the move, but there was no conviction they
would not continue to be plagued by political jitters.
Elsewhere the dollar retreated having failed to break through a key
resistance point at DM1.5625 against the German currency. It continued
to exhibit a firm tone against the yen but was less fortunate against
sterling, falling to $1.5609.
Sterling's trade-weighted index gained 0.2 to 80.0. Against the German
mark the pound was almost one pfennig higher at DM2.4359.
UK official reserves data for December showing a higher-than-forecast
rise of $62m, had little impact.

AS the world moves towards globalisation and an international approach
to business co-operation, we in the legal profession in Scotland are
faced with a bizarre situation that prevents us from doing cross-border
business within the UK never mind the rest of the world.
We first encountered the problem three years ago when we opened a
London office. At that time we were advised that the situation would be
resolved within months. We are still waiting.
Basically, our London-based English lawyers cannot, strictly speaking,
be partners in our Scottish firm. We, like other practices, have had to
adopt what is essentially a device to create a separate associated
company with its own partners based in England.
While our Scottish and English offices operate effectively as one law
firm, legally they have to appear to present themselves as separate
firms accountable to the separate English and Scottish Law Societies.
Our English lawyers are treated in exactly the same way as our 20
Scottish-based partners, yet we cannot list them as partners and the
legal niceties of separate accounts and separate accountability have to
be observed.
We were forced to set up and maintain this artificial framework by the
absurdly outdated rules that currently govern the setting up of UK as
opposed to multi-national practices. I believe it is time that the
Scottish and English Law Societies recognised that no purpose is served
by perpetuating this increasingly artificial divide.
Like other firms, we wish to operate as a UK-wide practice offering
all of the services generally expected of a multi-centred firm, but
under the existing rules it is impossible for us (or any other Scottish
law firm) to project ourselves in this way. We have, in effect, two
firms under one roof and we have to tip-toe around the partnership
question.
Moreover, it is only a matter of time before we see pressure from the
other direction, as English firms seek to expand north of the border.
And, within the next five to 10 years, there is every possibility that a
significant percentage of major commercial transactions will be handled
by firms that can properly be described as UK firms. Where will that
leave us and firms like us?
At the moment we cannot have a UK firm. We have firms that operate
throughout the UK with a mixture of English and Scottish partners, and
that imposed separation does nothing to strengthen the image and
reputation that Scottish practices wish to establish for themselves both
in Britain and internationally.
The statutory framework is already in existence under the inelegantly
titled Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990.
However, there are problems posed by the Financial Services Act and
until these are addressed and resolved we cannot move forward.
The Government has, apparently, indicated that if the Scottish and
English Law Societies can agree mutually acceptable solutions, the
Secretary of State will give his blessing. To date, though, the two
representative bodies have only managed to establish a Protocol for
cross-border operation. As this Protocol relates only to dual-qualified
solicitors, it has relatively little impact on the problem as a whole.
While the Scottish Law Society is anxious to resolve the problem, our
English cousins seem to be hidebound by their own rules and have been
slow to respond. Could this be because of their defensiveness about
London as the legal capital of the UK?
Both societies (particularly the Scottish one) are fiercely
independent and presumably intend to remain so. It seems there is no
appetite, as we have seen in the accountancy profession, to have one
body in the UK overseeing the entire legal profession.
But it is my view that this issue should not be about independence or
the lack of it. Solving this anomalous situation presents no threat to
either's independence. We desperately need to see a harmonisation of
policies and a good dose of commercial common sense would go a long way
to bringing the two ''sides'' together. If we allow this farcical
situation to continue, it will have an increasingly detrimental effect
on our Scottish firms.
Scottish law firms are respected throughout the world and many of our
larger practices are keen to spread their wings. Why then, must we be so
curtailed in our desire to become part of the bigger picture? It is my
hope that we will see a solution to this problem as soon as possible in
1995.
Or must we waste another year observing rules that serve no purpose?
We are, after all, one country and that is how we should be perceived
internationally.
Dr Kenneth Chrystie, a Glasgow-based partner with McClure Naismith
Anderson &amp; Gardiner, was talking to Yvonne Wightman.

Scotland, says Alf Young, must make the most of
its chance to learn from a unique US success story
STEVE Spinelli feigns anger with his class. Prospective employers have
been on campus, interviewing candidates for first jobs paying a $38,000
starting salary. Fourteen jobs were on offer. Four students have
bothered to turn up.
''You're screwing up,'' says Spinelli. ''Let's prepare beyond the
obvious. Go get some interviews with employers.''
He reminds the class of their contract: ''Remember the deal is: You
get rich and I get famous.'' Spinelli is already rich. At 25 he was part
of the team which launched Jiffy Lube, a fast oil-change franchise which
quickly spread across the US.
Spinelli quickly turned franchisee and built up a chain of 47 Jiffy
Lube depots in Massachusetts and New York. Before he was 40 he had sold
out to Pennzoil for some $20m.
That harvest was enough to retire on. But now Spinelli is teaching
entrepreneurship full-time at Babson College, a small private campus in
the rich, leafy hinterland of Boston and working for his doctorate at
Imperial College in London.
The Babson approach -- it was recently ranked number one among
American business schools on entrepreneurship programs by Success
magazine, with Harvard coming ninth -- is one prong in Scottish
Enterprise's strategy to ignite enterprise in Scotland, boost the
business birth rate here, and generate an additional 25,000 new Scottish
businesses by the end of the century.
Last October Professor William Bygrave, director of the Centre for
Entrepreneurial Studies at Babson, was in Stirling at the invitation of
Scottish Enterprise to give staff from Scotland's business schools a
first taste of the Babson technique.
Next week in Aberdeen Bygrave will be back, with a larger Babson team,
including Spinelli, for a more extensive presentation of the Babson
approach to teaching entrepreneurship. After that, the Scottish schools
will be invited to tender for the opportunity to launch the first
Babson-style entrepreneurship courses in Scotland.
In November I spent a week on the Babson campus, to form my own views
on how effectively this approach can be transplanted from New England to
Old Scotland.
Let's get the starkest contrasts out of the way first. Babson is an
elite American school. Tuition and other fees can run up to $25,000 a
year. Some of the students Spinelli was upbraiding are already rich,
very rich. ''For some of our students, Babson is a polishing school
before they go back to run family businesses,'' says another Babson
faculty member, Bill Johnston.
About a quarter of the students come from outwith the US, primarily
from South America and the Pacific Rim. And they are among the richest
kids on the campus. Mink coats to class and Porsches in the car park
highlight the point.
Babson College is currently on the biggest fund-raising drive in its
history. Aided by one of its most illustrious alumni, Edsel B Ford,
vice-president of the Ford Motor Corporation, Babson is confident of
raising $80m. It is already more than halfway there.
The Babson culture is intensely entrepreneurial. Spinelli is typical
of many faculty members in having built and harvested a business of his
own before turning to teaching. Bill Bygrave, an English-born,
Oxford-educated physicist, co-founded a couple of successful start-up
companies before entering academe.
Bill Johnson worked at senior executive level with companies like
Westinghouse, living through takeovers by what he terms ''redcoat''
raiders like Hanson and Williams Holdings. Julian Lange was teaching at
Harvard when he was asked by two students to join them in a company
they'd formed to develop the world's first electronic spreadsheet. He
was CEO for five years until the business was sold on. Now he's back
teaching, or as he puts it: ''Putting something back.''
Ed Marram, another physicist who teaches part-time at Babson, still
runs Geo-Centers, a private hi-tech conultancy employing more than 500
people. And Les Charm, another part-timer, has had retail franchises in
the petcare, haircare, and cosmetics fields and is now a company doctor.
Some of them talk proudly of being pracademics, welding their
practical business experience to a more theoretical approach, and in the
process challenging conventional business school practice.
The classes I experienced were largely taught, interactively, through
detailed case studies. Jiffy Lube is in there, with a host of other
cases. Sometimes, at the end of a demanding two-and-a-half-hour session,
one of the entrepreneurs involved in a case will come on down from the
back of the room to compare his or her real-life experience with the
class's conclusions.
From day one, students at Babson are encouraged to be entrepreneurial
too. More than half come from entrepreneurial families. But as Bygrave
puts it: ''You win as much prestige here from starting a campus business
as you gain from success on the sports field.''
I watched a first-year undergraduate class decide which of three
short-leet options they would unite behind as the class campus business
for the following semester. Babson puts up $3000 each time. The business
is expected to make money and devote the surplus to some socially useful
project in the local community.
I watched my class decide among a campus tanning salon, a pizza
delivery service covering all 13 undergraduate dorms, and a cut-price
campus CD store. I know the Young Enterprise programme in Scottish
schools claims better penetration than equivalent programmes Stateside,
but these proposals were worked out to a level of marketing and
budgetary detail which would, I submit, be quite exceptional among
17-and-18-year-olds here.
I talked to other Babson undergraduates who had moved much further up
the entrepreneurial ladder. Dale Wood is probably exceptional, even by
Babson standards. He leads a trio of students who have raised $3m so far
for a venture capital fund. Dale had started a business recycling
building materials before he left high school.
Kevin McCurdy is a Canadian who has launched Americap, a mail order
business offering up-market baseball caps. Other Babson students I met
are running businesses in advertising, marketing, laundry services,
selling T-shirts, and providing transport links with Boston. Some campus
businesses are so successful they are sold on from one generation of
students to the next.
The Babson approach to teaching entrepreneurship can and does get
mixed up with more overtly political rhetoric. Even in America it is
still looked at somewhat askance by those schooled in the more
conventional MBA approach to the real business of business schools. What
Bill Bygrave rather scornfully calls: ''The classic MBA as asset
allocator approach.''
I certainly found my brief taste of the teaching experience at Babson
as rigorous and intellectually demanding as anything I've experienced in
education here. But to transplant it successfully to Scotland needs
local entrepreneurs as willing as the Steve Spinellis of this world to
put something back.
It also needs a body of Scottish case studies and business school
staff prepared to embrace a more interactive, less academicised
appproach to teaching. It will be fascinating to see if the transplant
takes or is rejected.

THE turmoil in world bond and money markets boosted demand for
financial derivatives and helped LIFFE, the London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange, to report record trading volumes
last year.
During 1994, LIFFE traded a record 153 million futures and options
contracts, an increase of 50% over 1993. The annual average daily volume
rose to just above 607,000 contracts representing an average daily
turnover of #132.7bn.
The 50% increase in LIFFE's trading volumes was well ahead of growth
seen in rival European futures exchanges. The MATIF in France rose by
20% and the DTB in Germany by 18%.
Commenting on the record annual volume, Daniel Hodson, LIFFE's chief
executive, said he felt ''very bullish'' about London as a financial
centre both in terms of its European and global position.
There was significant growth in many contracts. During 1994, Italian
lira and the German mark-denominated products showed the fastest growth,
followed by the sterling-denominated product sector.
LIFFE's long gilt futures grew by 61% and the short sterling futures
by 37%. The exchange's Equity index products, the FTSE-100 Index future
and options, now complemented by the FTSE-250 futures contract
introduced last February, grew by 36% and 39% respectively.
LIFFE attributed the growth to the liquidity of the London market
throughout the market upheavals in the first half of last year.
Derivatives are increasingly being used by corporations and the
financial community to manage their investment risks, particularly
interest rates and foreign exchange.
While there have been some well-publicised reports of corporate losses
-- such as those incurred by the consumer products group Proctor &amp;
Gamble in the US -- derivatives, if properly used, are not risky.
A recently published Bank of England report noted that by their very
nature derivatives tend to be more responsive than cash market products
to certain exposures.
The regulatory authorities in both the US and UK would like to limit
any potential adverse effects of derivatives on the financial markets as
a whole.

The TrailBlazers scheme is now halfway through its third year,
and as the search continues for six more role-model companies
between now and June, John Ker, head of Owner-Managed
Business Services at Ernst &amp; Young in Glasgow, looks back this
week and next at the first six TrailBlazers of the Month
July: Stirling
Management Centre
THE general belief among Scottish industry and commerce that training
is essential to success was reflected in the success of the first
monthly winner in year three of the award scheme.
Stirling Management Centre, the purpose-built conference and
management training venue situated on the campus of Stirling University,
won the award back in July on account of business performance and
marketing ability.
Success for the centre, which has set new quality standards for
management training, is naturally determined by achieving continual
increases in the number of people using the facilities, and the centre
has ensured access to a growing clientele by diversifying outwith the
main training season to target groups beyond its core sector of training
personnel, senior managers, and executives.
In reaching organisers of sports groups, travel groups, social events,
dinners, and cultural visits, the financial stability of the centre even
during low-season periods has been ensured.
One of the most impressive aspects of the centre was the fact that it
is completely customer responsive. In determining training priorities,
not only is there a move by an increasing proportion oflarger companies
to conduct training internally, but access to academic resources is
assuming greater importance. Stirling Management Centre has undoubtedly
made the most of some distinct advantages it has, not least its
location, over its many competitors.
August: The Lewis
Group
THERE was a real element of secrecy surrounding the success of the
August winner, the Glasgow-based Lewis Group.
Having found it impossible to acquire any off-the-shelf packages
capable of achieving the required functions, this debt services
specialist developed its own unique computer software system, which has
resulted in such competitive advantage that rather than marketing the
system throughout the industry it decided to keep it to itself.
The Account Tracker, which creates a mirror image of a ledger,
generating invoices, statements and monitoring receipts of payments, is
now regarded as potentially the best in the business.
But success has come also from a series of prudent company
acquisitions undertaken over the years, all of which allowed the company
to complement and build on existing services, and also through matching
the resources of personnel with identified areas of potential growth.
Under the guidance of the chairman, Larry Lewis, the dedicated
programme of acquisition, diversification, and investment in information
technology has resulted in the group expanding from its core debt
collection business into new areas, including sales ledger management,
telemarketing, investigations, revenue services for local authorities,
and parking enforcement.
September: William
Paton Ltd
As Scotland's only shoe and insole manufacturer, supplying laces,
braids and tapes to the footwear manufacturing industry and laces and
insoles to the retail trade, William Paton Ltd of Johnstone has seen
turnover increase by 25% over the past three years -- and this in the
face of growing imports, principally from the Far East.
The deployment of world-class manufacturing techniques led to a 90%
cut in work-in-progress as well as a reduction from eight days to half a
day in throughput time for insoles.
A #1.2m investment in up-dating equipment and machinery, together with
packaging redesign, has also contributed to new success.
Building exports is a key element in the company's strategy and sales
to France, Greece, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Indonesia have increased.
And one particularly rewarding order came from to China, the world's
biggest shoe manufacturer.
New company leadership has seen a long-term strategy being identified
that will stand the company in good stead, and there is now an evident
company belief that there is a great deal more to be achieved through
further innovation and continued improvement.
Next week John Ker looks back at the three last winners of 1994.

PAUL Latimer has two swimming targets this year -- qualification for
the US National Collegiate finals in March, and a first British cap at
the European Championships in August, thus proving that he has forgotten
the disappointment of missing last year's Commonwealth Games.
Latimer ''escaped'' from the Scottish team rejection when he took up a
scholarship at the University of Texas in September, and admits it has
been the perfect move.
''The whole set-up at Texas is excellent,'' the Edinburgh 18-year-old
stressed during a short break back in Scotland. ''Both the swimming and
my studies are working out well.
''I'm now looking forward to the second half of the college season,
and then I will be home in time for the European trials in Sheffield in
April.''
At home, he also has made a big change to his swimming routine. A
member of Warrender since he took up the sport, he made a stop-gap
decision to train with Aberdeen coach Eileen Adams over the past week.
''I needed a change, although I've not yet decided what I will do when
I come back in the summer,'' he explained.
Meanwhile, Scottish team members for the Eight Nations Tournament in
Edinburgh in April will benefit from a two-week training camp in
Lanzarote in March, planned as a replacement for the Scots' involvement
in the World Cup meets in Europe.
While acknowledging the need to assist the swimmers targeting this
year's European Championships in Vienna in August, and next year's
Olympics, national coach Jim Park admitted that the training camp idea
is part of a longer term strategy aimed at Scotland's build-up to the
next Commonwealth Games.
''We hope to introduce better fitness testing and monitoring
programmes, and having the whole group together at a training camp will
help us to produce better feedback for the club coaches,'' said Park.
* MARK Foster landed a 50 metres winning double for Britain yesterday
as the two-day World Cup short-course meeting in Hong Kong came to an
end.
Foster, winner of the 50m butterfly on Monday, repeated the feat in
the 50m free-style in 22.46 seconds after undergoing a course of
acupuncture treatment which helped to ease a back injury.
Meanwhile, Germany's Franziska van Almsick reached her target of four
World Cup wins, adding the 100 and 400m free-style to yesterday's
triumphs at 50 and 200m.
Compatriot Sandra Volker, who set a 50m back-stroke short-course world
record on Monday, won the 100m back-stroke as the German squad swept to
victory in 22 of the 34 events in the absence of fellow swimming giants
China, Australia, Russia and the United States.

Hugh Dougherty finds that
Glasgow's latest bistro
can boast an unusual patron
MARCO Giannasi, the man behind the rebirth of Glasgow's Battlefield
Rest as a continental bistro, is one head waiter who has kept the head.
For although his #160,000 virtual rebuilding of the city's most famous
tram shelter has demanded a cool business head, he has also kept ahead
in other ways.
''It's all over the head of St Mungo,'' he says, examining a sculpted
version of the city's patron saint's head.
''The Rest used to have a Glasgow Corporation crest on its gable wall,
with St Mungo, in full bishop's vestments, looking down on what are now
our kitchens.
''Sadly, the saint's head was broken before I took over the building,
but I'm now having a complete replica made of the whole corporation
crest and we'll be celebrating when St Mungo is complete once again.''
Marco reckons that making sure St Mungo keeps the head should be good
for business.
''Along with many diners who have come to us since we opened, there
has been a steady stream of tram fans and admirers of good
architecture,'' he says.
''Putting St Mungo back together again will attract even more
nostalgia seekers.
''And what better way to pray for the success of your business, than
to have the patron saint of the city looking down on it?''

BRIAN Hamilton last night made the rare journey from Hibernian to
Hearts, after having felt he was unwanted by the Easter Road club.
The 27-year-old midfield player's contract at Hibs ran out on November
30, five years after his move from St Mirren.
The shock transfer, which brings to seven the new players Tommy McLean
has brought to Hearts, looks certain to end up at a transfer tribunal
after the clubs failed to agree on a fee.
But the former Saints and Scotland Under-21 man was just delighted to
get away from Easter Road and enjoy a fresh start.
''I was surprised but very happy to hear of Hearts' interest and was
so pleased to get the chance of joining a big, ambitious club,'' said
Hamilton.
''I tried several times to speak to Hibs about a new deal but felt
continually that I was getting nowhere. I wasn't being excessive in my
demands but was virtually given two choices in the end -- take it or
leave it.
''I didn't want to start signing monthly contracts -- I've seen other
Hibs players go down that road and it does no-one any good.''
Now Hamilton, after having starred in Hibs' 4-0 win over Dundee United
on Saturday, kick-starts his career in Sunday's televised visit to
Motherwell.
In two weeks he will have faced the daunting prospect of meeting his
former team-mates in the rearranged ''New Year'' Edinburgh derby at
Tynecastle.
''The first match against Hibs will be difficult after I feel I had
won over their fans after a bad start,'' he added. ''I feel I am playing
well at the moment and my future now is with Hearts, and taking that
form into their team.''
Manager McLean feels Hamilton will add balance to his midfield and the
likely #250,000 deal means the player follows a select few who have made
the same precarious move.

Algiers, Wednesday
ALGERIA'S Interior Minister vowed today that his bloodstained country
would protect Britons from Muslim fundamentalists despite their threat
to kill foreigners if embassies in Algiers did not shut by Saturday.
''These threats are disinformation and show,'' Abderahmane Meziane
Cherif told reporters in Tunis, referring to a letter received by
Britain telling it to close its embassy or see Britons ''killed in cold
blood''.
Cherif, in whose country four French and Belgian Roman Catholic
priests were murdered only last week, was attending an Arab ministerial
meeting in Tunis.
In Bonn, Stern magazine said Algerian Islamic militants had sent
similar letters to the German and other Western embassies in Algiers.
Cherif's pledge echoed earlier ones by Algerian officials to guarantee
the security of foreigners -- promises which have not saved 76 from
being killed in the past 16 months, nor prevented the Christmas
hijacking of an Air France airliner in Algiers.
Despite the guarantees, several Western embassies have already pulled
out of Algeria while the British, French, US, and German embassies have
sharply reduced staff.
Their governments have also told nationals to get out of the north
African country unless their presence is vital.
The latest threat came from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), sources
said. In 1993 the GIA ordered foreigners to leave by December 1 or face
death, provoking an exodus of thousands of people, notably nationals of
France, the former colonial power.
In its latest warning, it ordered all diplomatic staff to leave
Algeria as quickly as possible, break all contacts with the country and
clear the embassy by January 7.
The GIA has been blamed by authorities for the murder of many of the
foreigners and much of the violence which erupted in January 1992 after
the army-backed authorities cancelled a General Election Islamists were
poised to win.
Algerian authorities acknowledge that more than 11,000 people have
been killed in the strife, while independent and foreign sources
estimate the death toll at up to 30,000.
A Western diplomat said that the death toll now was running at between
600 and 700 a week. Official figures often speak of between 70 and 100
being killed each week -- mostly fundamentalists.
Cherif insisted that what he termed ''terrorism'' was not a monopoly
of Algeria. ''It is a worldwide phenomenon . . . it is probably going to
spread to other countries.''
He pledged however: ''I can tell you that nobody will succeed in
bringing our country to its knees.''--Reuter.

SCOTTISH Life Assurance has announced lower bonus rates for 1994 on
its range of with profit endowment policies which means that payouts on
policies maturing on January 1, 1995, will be lower, though the return
is still well above inflation, writes CHRIS STONE.
A with-profit endowment policy taken out by a male aged 30 next
birthday at the outset with a monthly premium of #30 will receive a
payout of #5708 on a 10-year policy against #6105 a year ago,
representing a net return per annum of 8.9%.
Over 15 years the amount drops from #15,993 to #13,667, to give a
return of 11.5% a year, and over 20 years from #35,617 to #31,771 for a
13.2% net return. For a 25-year term, the policholder collects #59,687
against #63,252 previously, a return of 13% a year.

<HEADLINE>Scotland maintains its improved share of gross domestic product</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S share of UK gross domestic product (GDP) in 1993 maintained
the improvement recorded in 1992. For two years in a row, the gap with
England has been running at its narrowest level since 1984.
According to new data from the Central Statistical Office, provisional
estimates give Scotland an 8.7% share of UK GDP in 1993, the same
percentage as 1992, and well up on the 8.3% share recorded in both 1988
and 1989, when the gap with England was at its widest.
On an indexed per capita basis, Scottish GDP in 1993 was marginally
down on 1992. But so was the equivalent English figure.
With the UK per capita figure indexed at 100, Scottish GDP fell from
98.6 to 98.4 per head between 1992 and 1993. English per capita GDP fell
from 101.8 to 101.7 over the same period.
As the graph shows, the nadir of Scotland's per capita GDP performance
in 1988 and 1989 coincides with the much less marked peak in England's
performance.
Scotland's 1993 performance outstrips Northern Ireland, Wales and six
English regions. Only East Anglia and the South-east of England do
better than Scotland, on a per capita basis.
But, while Scotland's indexed GDP performance per head has improved
from 93.3 in 1989 to 98.4 in 1993, Greater London has declined from
126.7 to 124.7 over the same period and the rest of the South-east has
fallen from 113.5 to 110.5. East Anglia grew marginally from 100.9 to
101.7.
The figures appear to confirm other evidence that Scotland escaped
relatively lightly from the recession of the early 1990s. But, despite
the narrowing of the gap with England as a whole, per capita GDP in
Greater London is still 25% above the UK average, and marginally further
ahead of the Scottish average.
The 1993 regional accounts, published in the December edition of
Economic Trends, also include a sectoral breakdown for GDP by region.
Most English regions show construction output falling progressively in
1991, 1992, and 1993.
Output of mining and quarrying, including oil extraction, showed falls
in 1993 in Yorkshire &amp; Humberside and East Midlands, the heartlands of
the English coal industry. In Scotland, mining output grew quite
strongly in 1993, thanks almost certainly to increased oil activity.
The largest percentage increases in manufacturing output in 1993 were
enjoyed by two parts of the UK which score worst on the overall GDP
measures, Wales and Northern Ireland, up 11.6% and 8.2% respectively.
Scottish manaufacturing enjoyed a more modest 3.8% rise in output in
1993.
In total, Scottish GDP is provisionally estimated at #46.614 billion
and per capita GDP at #9104 in 1993.
That 8.7% share of UK GDP compares with an 8.8% share of population,
an 8% share of consumers' expenditure in 1992, an 8.7% share of personal
income in 1992, and an 8.8% share of household income in the same year.

WITH Phoneday arriving on April 16, many businesses in Scotland do not
yet appear to have grasped the importance of the event.
On that day -- Easter Sunday -- every geographical telephone code in
Britain will change, and callers using existing national codes such as
041 or 031 will not get through.
A straw poll of printers, covering commercial, jobbing and the High
Street 'quick print' operations, shows that the expected surge of
business for new brochures, price lists, letterheads, compliment slips,
and business cards has simply not yet materialised.
Jobbing printer Kevin Murphy has been automatically adding the
necessary extra digit to his customers phone and fax numbers for almost
a year, after a chance conversation with a BT engineer last March about
number changes in his home town of Helensburgh taught him the national
codes to become compulsory from April 16 were already in use.
He said: ''Although BT has been advertising that new codes could be
used alongside the existing one from last August, I discovered they were
operating from last March, so every time we have been asked to print or
reprint I have automatically changed the national code as well as the
new local number and killed two birds with one stone.''
But he adds that the initiative has always come from him, and not the
customer, and he has had to explain on numerous occasions when the
customer has complained that he has printed the wrong number.
''There is widespread ignorance of the change, and I predict a lot of
confusion unless BT steps up its advertising to tell people what the
changes mean,'' he said.
A similar number change, on Arran three years ago, is still causing
problems for island printer John Millar of the Arran Banner.
He said: ''When I mention the upcoming code change, everyone thinks
you are talking about the last change, when the island's exchanges went
digital and the old three-figure numbers for each village were converted
to six figures and a national code.
''They simply do not understand that the national codes are changing.
Not one customer has asked for the new code, I have had to take the
initiative and the subsequent hassle when they think I have mis-printed
their telephone or fax number.''
Leading Glasgow commercial printer John McCormick and Co., of Buchanan
Street, has found that even offering to change artwork free of charge
for customers has prompted little interest.
Mr David McCormick said: ''Six months ago we sent a circular round
3000 customers offering to alter artwork free of charge, but only a
handful responded to the offer.''
Like other printers contracted, his company has been making the
changes as and when business comes in for reprint, and has even found
that some customers needing printed material are unwilling to pay for
new artwork until nearer April when they will be forced to make the
change.
One printer, however, who is seeing the benefit of the change is Simon
Allen, of Prontaprint, in Inverness. He estimates that business is up by
15% as a result of the change, and is gearing up for a rush in March and
April.
''There is certainly some awareness of the change, but only about
one-in-three customers looking for letterheads are specifying the new
number.''
He faces additional problems in that many of his customers are small
export businesses or hotels which also print on their stationery the
dialling code from abroad, which is also changing.
Although BT and Mercury have been running advertisements and an
awareness campaign for some months to encourage customers to use the new
codes, BT directory inquiries are not helping customers make the
transition by still giving the existing national codes.
A BT spokesman said: ''Despite already spending millions on an
awareness campaign, our research shows that this initiative announced by
the telecommunications watchdog Oftel in 1992 to change the codes has
not sunk in to his many businesses.
''Half of all businesses have done nothing about it, and a third could
not quote their new phone number from April 16, while only one in six
were aware of the international code change.''
One business taking full advantage of the transition period to make
the various changes is the West of Scotland region of Wimpey Homes.
Administration and Finance manager Iain MacDougall said: ''As a large
user of headed notepaper and business cards, we have been automatically
changing the codes as we reprint, so there should be no need to destroy
out-of-date stationery in April.''
He estimates the extra quantifiable cost to his regional office of
Britain's leading housebuilder at less than #1000.
''But that is the tip of the iceberg, and relates only to typesetting
changes. What we will never be able to cost is the unproductive staff
time spent on reprogramming equipment such as memory telephones, fax
machines, and portable telephones.
''We have also had to remember that modems for data transmission and
alarm systems connected to the telephone network also need changing.''
This latter point is particularly important for anyone with an alarm
system connected to the telephone network, as failure to change the code
could mean the call to the police not getting through and insurance
companies refusing to meet claims under the insured's policy.
BT is offering a free helpline for users. Call 0800 01 01 01.

SHARES in Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator and the
Euro Disney theme park have risen strongly in recent months albeit from
a low base. Both companies are benefiting from the stock market's
perception that their internal problems have largely been solved.
Yesterday, Eurotunnel shares raced ahead 15p to 312p, further boosted
by a ''buy'' recommendation from City analysts at Salomon Brothers in
London. Michael Cohen of Salomon has been recommending the shares since
last November and believes they represent good value at up to 340p.
Increased demand for its service is also behind the share price
improvement at Euro Disney. The recent announcement of improved
attendance figures has increased demand for the shares which yesterday
gained 1p to 140p.
In the case of Eurotunnel, strong demand for the new Eurostar service
from London to Paris, has undoubtedly boosted sentiment.
Eurostar appears to have caught the imagination with people using the
service for business and pleasure. Indeed, many people have wanted to
book tickets only to find that the train is full. Unlike British Rail
there is no standing allowed on the EuroStar.
Yesterday, it was announced that Le Shuttle tourist service for cars
will now run 24 hours a day. There will be 40 departures a day compared
with 26 during the introductory service launched on December 22. During
the last two weeks of December, there were more than 12,000 reservations
made for Le Shuttle.
Eurotunnel said that by the end of December, 65,000 HGV's and 82,000
cars had travelled through the tunnel, as well as 700 EuroStar passenger
trains and 1200 railfreight trains. ''Their frequency and capacity will
continue to increase during the first quarter of 1995, building up to
the peak summer period'' said Eurotunnel.
Fears that the cross Channel ferry services will suffer a decline in
business with trains travelling through the Channel Tunnel prompted a
14p fall in the shares of P &amp; O to 596p.
In the near future, Eurotunnel is expected to publish a favourable
progress report on trading volume in the first two months of EuroStar's
operation. Strong demand may enable Eurotunnel to meet the 1994 revenue
forecast of #35m. However, Le Shuttle is not out of the woods yet. Its
revenues must finance #8000m of debt.
As recently as mid-October last year, Eurotunnel shares touched a low
of 221p, with many in the City doubting the viability of the project.
However, by 1996, Le Shuttle should be carrying half the car and coach
passengers currently crossing the Channel by ferry.
Rumours earlier last year that Euro Disney might close prompted many
potential customers to stay away between March and May. However, once
the company's refinancing was completed in June, customer numbers
started to improve, although the total for the financial year was still
down 10% at 8.8 million. However, many of those customers who have
visited the park will return again, which is a good base on which to
build.
Its financial crisis behind it, Euro Disney is now concentrating on
boosting customer numbers. Entry prices are to be cut by about 20% from
April.
The company expects to attract at least the extra 700,000 visitors
needed to compensate for the lower priced tickets. The new entry price
for the high season from April 1, 1995, and October 1, 1995, is #23. The
off-peak price starting on 2 October will be #18.
Advertising campaigns have been tailored for each of its large
European markets and a new #71.6m attraction, Space Mountain, is due to
open in June, which will give visitors the impression of being fired
from a cannon.
Although the company now appears to be well on the recovery track, it
faces tough competition from rival parks planned for Spain and Germany.
This makes growth prospects less attractive than those of Eurotunnel and
as such Eurotunnel's shares are the more attractive of the two.

POTENTIAL employees at a Scottish forestry firm will find that a
wasteful childhood spent climbing trees is a distinct advantage at a job
interview.
Ramsay MacDonell and Company, based in Forres, Morayshire, is sending
its staff up trees to collect pine cones -- which they then sell on to
other firms for use as pot-pourri or Christmas tree decorations.
The company only recently branched out into the unusual business
venture and now everyone taking a job has to be able to scale 100-ft
pine trees.
''There's no point in applying for a job with us if you haven't got a
head for heights,'' said Mr MacDonell.
''My lads have got a strong climbing instinct in them and are
self-assured.
They like the thrill of climbing and having an element of danger but
they need to be sensible, because a mistake made up a tree can prove
fatal.''
''And I get a kick because we are making sure nothing is going to
waste -- it is quite a green scheme.''
Mr MacDonell has been in forestry since leaving school and employs 15
people who work mainly on private Highland estates. Part of that work
involves gathering cones to extract seeds for future plantations.
In the past, the spent cones were dumped but Moray, Badenoch, and
Strathspey Enterprise suggested the artificial Christmas tree venture.
He now sends scores of consignments to Christmas tree manufacturers in
the south.
In the manufacturing process cones are fixed to plastic branches and
are painted various colours on non-natural effect trees.
''I won't go into details because I don't want to encourage
competitors, but let's just say I'm not complaining at the returns,''
said Mr MacDonell.
''We are dealing with several major companies, mainly in England and
Wales.''
The foresters use mountain-climbing gear to scale Scots Pine, Sitka
Spruce, and Douglas and Noble Firs in their quest for cones.
The saplings are transplanted to estates, while the cones are boxed up
and transported south to begin their new lease of life as decorations.

* ALTHOUGH the area codes are being changed by adding an extra '1' to
each code, so that Glasgow changes from '041' to '0141', Edinburgh from
'031' to '0131' and Stirling from '0786' to '01786', five English cities
are getting completely new codes.
Oftel, which is behind the initiative, says this is necessary because
of the demand for additional numbers due to rapidly developing business
activity in Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester and Bristol, along
with an exceptional demand from new communications operators and cable
TV companies for blocks of additional numbers in these cities.
Consequently, subscribers in these cities will fall into line with
other major cities such as Glasgow and Manchester and have a new four
digit national code followed by a seven digit local number.

PAUL Latimer has two swimming targets this year -- qualification for
the US National Collegiate finals in March, and a first British cap at
the European Championships in August, thus proving that he has forgotten
the disappointment of missing last year's Commonwealth Games.
Latimer ''escaped'' from the Scottish team rejection when he took up a
scholarship at the University of Texas in September, and admits it has
been the perfect move.
''The whole set-up at Texas is excellent,'' the Edinburgh 18-year-old
stressed during a short break back in Scotland. ''Both the swimming and
my studies are working out well.
''I'm now looking forward to the second half of the college season,
and then I will be home in time for the European trials in Sheffield in
April.''
At home, he also has made a big change to his swimming routine. A
member of Warrender since he took up the sport, he made a stop-gap
decision to train with Aberdeen coach Eileen Adams over the past week.
''I needed a change, although I've not yet decided what I will do when
I come back in the summer,'' he explained.
Meanwhile, Scottish team members for the Eight Nations Tournament in
Edinburgh in April will benefit from a two-week training camp in
Lanzarote in March, planned as a replacement for the Scots' involvement
in the World Cup meets in Europe.
While acknowledging the need to assist the swimmers targeting this
year's European Championships in Vienna in August, and next year's
Olympics, national coach Jim Park admitted that the training camp idea
is part of a longer term strategy aimed at Scotland's build-up to the
next Commonwealth Games.
''We hope to introduce better fitness testing and monitoring
programmes, and having the whole group together at a training camp will
help us to produce better feedback for the club coaches,'' said Park.
* MARK Foster landed a 50 metres winning double for Britain yesterday
as the two-day World Cup short-course meeting in Hong Kong came to an
end.
Foster, winner of the 50m butterfly on Monday, repeated the feat in
the 50m free-style in 22.46 seconds after undergoing a course of
acupuncture treatment which helped to ease a back injury.
Meanwhile, Germany's Franziska van Almsick reached her target of four
World Cup wins, adding the 100 and 400m free-style to yesterday's
triumphs at 50 and 200m.
Compatriot Sandra Volker, who set a 50m back-stroke short-course world
record on Monday, won the 100m back-stroke as the German squad swept to
victory in 22 of the 34 events in the absence of fellow swimming giants
China, Australia, Russia and the United States.

FORMER Great Britain rugby league winger, Barry Ledger, banned from
playing for six months after having tested positive for cannabis, is
considering his future in the game.
The 32-year-old Swinton star was suspended by the league's board of
directors yesterday after a two-hour hearing in Leeds -- a decision that
has ruled him out for the remainder of this season.
He had tested positive after the second division game against
Ryedale-York on November 6, and was banned on November 29 pending the
analysis of a B sample. The results came out yesterday.
A statement issued by the league said: ''Mr Ledger's B sample was
found to contain a banned substance (cannabis) as defined in the RFL's
Doping Control Regulations. The board is determined to reinforce rugby
league's image as a drugs-free sport. The ban will take effect from
November 29 last year.''
Ledger said he thought the ban was a little harsh and when asked
whether he would carry on playing next season, he added: ''I'll have to
think about that.''
Ledger is the second league player to test positive for cannabis. The
other case involved Bradford's New Zealand international Dave Watson,
who was banned for three months in 1992 while playing for Halifax.
Doncaster full-back Jamie Bloemo also was banned for two years for
taking anabolic steroids.

FORT William and Kingussie meet at An Aird on Saturday in what is
virtually the north first division shinty championship decider, although
Fort William still have six of their 14 matches to play.
Kingussie, who will have just three more games left after Saturday,
have to tackle their biggest game of the season so far without the
touchline guidance of team manager Ian Ross, who is in hospital in
Inverness for a hip-replacement operation. National coach Donnie Grant
will take over on Saturday, and could well be confirmed early next week
as caretaker for the three months or so while Ross recuperates.
Fort William's main problem on Saturday could stem from the fact that
they have played just one match in the past seven weeks, on December 17,
when Kingussie also had their last outing.
Both teams have lost just once in the league and neither should have
any difficulty motivating their players for this one. Both have declared
full squads, with Fort William's Adam Robertson due to return from a
festive break on the Continent tomorrow in time for the game.
Kingussie have all 15 of their first-team pool available, although
club captain Dallas Young may well have to sit this one out. Fort, by
contrast, have used no fewer than 24 players in their league campaign as
they continue their policy of blooding youngsters for the future.
Saturday's game is no place for experimentation, however, and novices
will be confined to the touchline, where they will be expected to
continue their education.
In the south, Oban Camanachd's match with Glasgow Mid Argyll at
Mossfield Park, Oban, is just as crucial. Camanachd have been
front-runners in the title race since their astonishing lapse against
Ballachulish in the first game of the season, but they go into
Saturday's game without ace marksman David McCuish, who is suspended,
and Duncan Morrison, who is unavailable due to holiday commitments.
The title race in the south could not be more competitive. If
Camanachd lose at the weekend, Mid Argyll and Kyles could still match
their total of 23 points, with Glenorchy still capable of reaching 25.
All four teams are still serious contenders for a championship which the
Oban side have dominated for the past few seasons.
Kyles meanwhile face a hazardous trip to Inveraray, whose form has
been disappointing all season. Much better was expected of them and they
could just give some indication of their potential in this one, as
shinty players far and wide re-emerge from the various excesses of their
festive break, weather permitting.

ALAN Wells captain of England A's cricket team last night defended his
decision to hold back leg spinner Ian Salisbury for more than three
hours in Bombay.
Salisbury, the squad's senior spinner, grew more impatient as fellow
slow bowlers Richard Stemp and Paul Weekes wheeled away through a long
hot afternoon, the second of this opening four-day match.
And when he was finally thrown the ball deep into the final session,
Salisbury responded by taking two for 25 from a magical 10 overs.
He got Amol Muzumdar, India's latest batting discovery, for 68 and by
the close India Youth were 152 for five in reply to England A's 283.
This is a crucial tour for Salisbury, 25 this month and keen to regain
the Test place he lost following last winter's tour of the West Indies.
He has certainly started well, and in the last hour could have added a
couple more wickets. Most importantly, the ball which defeated classy
Muzumdar -- a sharp leg-break edged to slip -- showed Salisbury has the
armoury to do damage at the highest level.
Salisbury shrugged off the day's talking point, and Wells, also
Salisbury's captain at Sussex, refused to concede it was an issue.
He said: ''Ian likes to bowl when the ball is a little bit older
anyway -- being held back was no reflection on him at all. Stemp and
Weekes put pressure on the batsmen and whenever things are going your
way you are loathed to change it.''
Stemp and Weekes could have taken more than just one wicket apiece
given better luck.

CAPTAIN Hansie Cronje hit his fourth Test century and wicketkeeper
Dave Richardson struck an unbeaten 70 to give South Africa the upper
hand over New Zealand in the third and final Test at Cape Town
yesterday.
South Africa extended their overnight 152 for three to 381 for seven
in reply to New Zealand's first innings of 288 at the close on the third
day.
With a lead of 93, three wickets left, and two days to go, the South
Africans are well placed to press for victory in the deciding game of
the series, which is level 1-1.
Cronje, resuming in the morning on 11, reached his hundred with a
single off left-arm spinner Matthew Hart and receiveda standing ovation
from a crowd of 15,230.
Just when he seemed certain to survive until tea, he mistimed an
on-drive against Hart and was caught by Chris Pringle for 112.
In the morning session, John Commins (27) failed to reach the pitch of
a Hart delivery and pushed an attempted off-drive to Ken Rutherford at
short extra cover, and Jonty Rhodes was bowled for 18.
Cronje then put on 46 for the sixth wicket with Brian McMillan, the
stand ending when the all-rounder fell lbw to Chris Pringle for 18.
Cronje, whose three previous centuries led to test victories over Sri
Lanka, India and Australia, added 54 with Richardson for the seventh
wicket before the captain's dismissal just before tea.
Scores:
New Zealand 288; South Africa 381 for seven (J Cronje 112, D
Richardson 70 n.o., G Kirsten 64, R Steyn 38).

team.
Coulthard secured the drive ahead of the 1992 Formula One world
champion and said: ''I have always been a great fan of Nigel. He is
still a fantastic driver and has always shown 110% effort and commitment
throughout his career.''
The 23-year-old Scot and team-mate Damon Hill start testing the FW16
Williams car, powered by the three-litre V-10 Renault engine, at Estoril
in Portugal next week. The new FW17 Williams car will be unveiled in the

ONE of Scotland's little-known world champions, Raymond Johnson of
East Kilbride, has been asked to hand back the bicycle which he hoped
would take him to his third title in a row later this year. Johnson
retained his age-group title at the World Biathlon Championships in
Tasmania last November and finished second senior in the amateur field.
Competing in a sport dominated by professionals, self-employed window
cleaner Johnson spent more than #6000 last year and counted himself
lucky when a sponsorship deal with an Ayrshire cycle head-gear company
gained him a new light-weight cycle frame worth #350. But his backing
company went out of business, leaving the cycle supplied unpaid and now
Johnson has been asked to send back the merchandise.

PHIL Tufnell put the brake on Australia's bid for a historic victory
at the SCG this morning. But, tightly though spinner Tufnell bowled,
England could not get the early breakthrough they needed to boost their
hopes of a series-reviving victory.
At lunch, the Michael Slater-Mark Taylor partnership remained
unbroken, with Slater having reached his century in the last over before
the break and Taylor on 94. The runs, however, had come slowly and
Australia at that point needed 243 to win.
The nearest England came to a wicket was when Slater sliced Tufnell to
wide mid-off after 55 minutes play on the final day of the third Test.
John Crawley, turning and running towards the boundary, just about got
underneath a horrible, swirling chance but laid no more than fingertips
to the ball.
Australia, having been set 449 for victory, were then 157 without loss
-- and Slater had escaped on 74. His wild shot was brought about by
frustration at Tufnell's accuracy, the slow left-armer having conceded
just six runs from his first seven overs.
With first Darren Gough and then Devon Malcolm also giving little
away, Australia added only 21 runs to their overnight 139 during the
first hour.
England, 2-0 down in the series, needed a victory to keep alives their
faint hopes of regaining the Ashes. And Australia, despite yesterday's
flying start from Slater and Taylor, would happily settle for a draw if
their tilt at establising a record fourth innings victory total lost
momentum.
With showers forecast, the bookmakers were heavily favouring a draw
when play began, but their odds against Australia creating history had
dropped to 7-2 overnight while an England victory was rated at 4-1.
Among those watching the action was Neil Fairbrother, who arrived in
Sydney this morning. England's fourth new face of the tour is likely to
be considered for Saturday's World Series Cup match against Zimbabwe in
Brisbane.
Slater survived a close lbw call -- and Australia's luck held again
when Taylor might have been run out. Having pulled Angus Fraser to deep
mid-wicket, the left-hander went for a third as Malcolm picked up and
threw to the non-striker's end.
Graham Gooch whipped off the bails, but umpire Darrell Hair did not
bother to call for a TV replay, believing Taylor, on 78, had made his
ground. In fact, television evidence suggested he might have finished
short of safety.
Hair was involved in a similar controversy during England's World
Series Cup defeat by Zimbabwe at the SCG on December 15. On that
occasion, he gave opener Grant Flower the benefit of the doubt -- and TV
replays showed he should not have done. Flower, 26 at the time, went on
to make 84 crucial runs.
Earlier, Mike Atherton had been unrepentant last night over a decision
that almost certainly cost Graeme Hick his maiden Ashes century. Four
years ago to the day, Atherton celebrated at the SCG after reaching
three figures against Australia for the first and, so far, only time in
his career.
But with this series at a point of no return, England's captain took
the clinical decision to declare on the same ground when Hick was just
two runs away from a coveted hundred. ''He was aware of the situation,''
insisted Atherton.
Hick has dreamed of scoring a Test century against Australia since he
was dropped for under-achieving during the 1993 Ashes series in England.
Last night, however, he refused to make any comment as he left the SCG
-- and Atherton was in no mood to explain the chain of events which left
Hick looking crestfallen.
England's skipper, stung by criticism after last week's heavy second
Test defeat in Melbourne, has all but cut off relations with the media
outside of his official obligations.
''I give Press conferences before and after a Test,'' he said when
asked to expand on his declaration thinking. ''I don't give a stuff what
you lot write. I don't care what you lot think about my decision.''
Without the benefit of information from the horse's mouth, it is only
possible to guess at what was going through Atherton's mind.
He was apparently aiming to declare at around 3pm with an overall lead
of 450. In the event, he called halt at 2.57pm when England were 448
ahead.

PETER Shilton's future as Plymouth manager was still on the rocks last
night after he failed to meet a cash demand.
The former England keeper had been given until late in the afternoon
to pay the outstanding amount of a tax demand of #50,000 stemming from
his signing-on fee from Derby two years ago -- or face the sack.
Shilton, who won a record 125 caps for England, failed to provide the
outstanding money and was suspended on full pay.
Former Ipswich and Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Steve McCall has
been appointed temporary player-manager.
The suspension means Shilton will not be in charge when Plymouth visit
one of his former clubs, Nottingham Forest, for an FA Cup, third round
tie on Saturday.
Plymouth chairman Dan McCauley confirmed: ''The outstanding money has
not been forthcoming.'' And asked if the 45-year-old Shilton eventually
would be reinstated, McCauley said: ''I would say it would be very
difficult for him to do that.
''We are not keen on change because change means risk, but his
financial problems have not helped.''
McCauley, a Devon-based millionaire, added: ''Peter Shilton has been
suspended on full pay. In the meantime we will be meeting our solicitors
and then probably we will meet Mr Shilton again.
''We have got to take legal advice and we have got to hold interviews
with Peter Shilton. But we took advice from a specialist in employment
law. What we have done is right.''
Shilton, who had arrived 15 minutes late for a scheduled meeting with
the board, emerged after six minutes to reveal he had been suspended.
He added: ''I have asked the chairman under what terms of my contract
he has the right to do that.''
The Inland Revenue will be at Plymouth's regular monthly board meeting
this afternoon.
Meanwhile, former England Under-21 midfielder McCall admitted he had
been surprised by his caretaker role.
He said: ''I feel a bit awkward but what has happened is between Peter
Shilton and the board, and I have been asked to get on with the team
selection and proceed with that.''
McCall was Shilton's second signing -- joining the Devon club from
Wednesday for #25,000. The 34-year-old, voted Plymouth's Player of the
Year for the past two seasons, hopes that Shilton's temporary assistant
manager, Ian Bowyer, will also assist him.
He said he would also be aiming to talk to Shilton's 17-year-old son
Sam, a left-winger who has already made his debut for Plymouth.

BRIAN Hamilton last night made the rare journey from Hibernian to
Hearts, after having felt he was unwanted by the Easter Road club.
The 27-year-old midfield player's contract at Hibs ran out on November
30, five years after his move from St Mirren.
The shock transfer, which brings to seven the new players Tommy McLean
has brought to Hearts, looks certain to end up at a transfer tribunal
after the clubs failed to agree on a fee.
But the former Saints and Scotland Under-21 man was just delighted to
get away from Easter Road and enjoy a fresh start.
''I was surprised but very happy to hear of Hearts' interest and was
so pleased to get the chance of joining a big, ambitious club,'' said
Hamilton.
''I tried several times to speak to Hibs about a new deal but felt
continually that I was getting nowhere. I wasn't being excessive in my
demands but was virtually given two choices in the end -- take it or
leave it.
''I didn't want to start signing monthly contracts -- I've seen other
Hibs players go down that road and it does no-one any good.''
Now Hamilton, after having starred in Hibs' 4-0 win over Dundee United
on Saturday, kick-starts his career in Sunday's televised visit to
Motherwell.
In two weeks he will have faced the daunting prospect of meeting his
former team-mates in the rearranged ''New Year'' Edinburgh derby at
Tynecastle.
''The first match against Hibs will be difficult after I feel I had
won over their fans after a bad start,'' he added. ''I feel I am playing
well at the moment and my future now is with Hearts, and taking that
form into their team.''
Manager McLean feels Hamilton will add balance to his midfield and the
likely #250,000 deal means the player follows a select few who have made
the same precarious move.

Rangers 1, Celtic 1.
ANOTHER step towards a seventh successive premier division
championship was taken by Rangers last night, but other than that, the
Ibrox side had little about which to celebrate. Much was expected of
them and, frankly, they failed to deliver while Celtic, patched up and
fresh-faced in various positions, stole the show in the second half.
With a shade more good fortune, Tommy Burns' side would have scored
more than once, but while a second goal would have given them three
points, it might also have taken the shine off Paul Byrne's second-half
strike which was quite stunning.
The Irishman, who scored in his last first team appearance, also
against Rangers at Hampden back in October, equalised the goal scored in
the first half by Ian Ferguson -- his first of the season -- who
probably believed his team-mates would go and secure maximum points. But
Celtic had other ideas. They resumed with greater zest and skill, and as
the second half progressed they grew in confidence.
It was only in the closing minutes of the match that Rangers, who had
too many players out of sync, came back into the match, but by then
their supporters had started to drift away, bemoaning the performance.
The fans had anticipated a comfortable win because of Celtic's youthful
look which was forced because of their injury problems.
One Rangers fan in the back of the main stand couldn't stand the
pressure, and in his anxiety to shout at his team, he let go of his
teeth. His wallies ended up about three rows in front.
Celtic's fans held on to their teeth and their credibility, and were,
in fact, the happier of the two sets of supporters. They had probably
arrived at Ibrox expecting another defeat, but left for home much more
confident about what Burns is trying to achieve.
However, Ferguson's goal was the only notable event of the first half
in which Brian Laudrup played only on the fringes. It was as though he
kept looking in and deciding against taking part in what he saw going
on.
Rangers will have to do without him in the next couple of matches
while he is on international duty with Denmark, and Walter Smith can
only hope Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist regain fitness quickly.
Celtic's problems were evident as they lined up with Stuart Gray in a
defence which also had Tommy Boyd in the centre. Mike Galloway, who had
not featured in the first team for a month, was at right full back.
Also Byrne was in, and the tiny figure of Brian McLaughlin was there,
but could barely be seen on Celtic's left flank. Even though they were
unfamiliar in appearance, Celtic didn't waste any time in introducing
themselves to Rangers, and in particular Gordon Durie and David
Robertson.
First Brian O'Neil clattered into Durie and was fortunate to escape
punishment, and then Galloway body-checked Robertson, who was trying a
wall pass with Pieter Huistra.
Galloway was booked and a minute later, O'Neil selected another
target, this time Charlie Miller, and left him on the ground. The Celtic
player was cautioned, but he and his defensive colleagues had made it
clear they would not be passed easily.
However, Laudrup demonstrated he can pass defenders almost as though
he has a divine right to do so, and after he had skipped away from
Galloway, he tried to chip Pat Bonner from an acute angle. The ball
sailed narrowly wide, perhaps a reminder that the Dane is, after all, a
mortal.
Laudrup should have found the net in 25 minutes, though, after Durie's
pass had been deflected by O'Neil, but he slid the ball wide of Bonner's
right-hand post.
The keeper was exposed again in 38 minutes when McCall's high ball
dropped just inside Celtic's box, and Miller managed to jab out a leg
and touch the ball on.
Gray seemed to hesitate as the ball flew to the right of Bonner's
goal, but Ferguson was alert and his shot was low and true.
A silence fell over Celtic's supporters, and just before half time
when McLaughlin hit his shot from the edge of Rangers' penalty area over
the bar and high into the Copeland Road stand, their hearts sank. The
Ibrox regulars were in full voice, anticipating their team would go for
the jugular in the second half.
Miller, who had taken a heavy knock in the first half, didn't
re-appear after the break and Rangers resumed with Ian Durrant in
midfield, yet another example of their strength in depth.
Still, it was Celtic who made the running with Phil O'Donnell, a
surprising inclusion in their side since he had been labouring because
of injury, being denied only by the speed of Robertson, who managed to
block a shot after the Celtic player had run through a sparsely
populated Rangers defence.
A few minutes later O'Donnell tried again, this time with a header,
but the ball carried too far and dropped on to the roof of Colin Scott's
net.
Celtic were growing in confidence and pinning Rangers in their own
territory where they were behaving in a most erratic manner, with the
ball being swiped at wildly. It was inevitable that Celtic would take
advantage, and they did in 59 minutes.
John Collins collected the ball on Celtic's left and saw Byrne
arriving at speed towards the far post. Collins' ball was delivered with
stunning accuracy, and Byrne's finishing shot from just inside the box
was equally brilliant.
The goal gave them even greater belief, and Celtic began to dominate
the match, getting to most balls first, leaving Rangers' players lunging
at spaces.
Celtic's midfield players were enjoying the freedom but just when it
looked as though they would engineer a second breakthrough, Laudrup
burst forward.
The Dane caught Celtic's defence short and picked out Durie running to
his left. The ball was played perfectly, but Durie shot straight at
Bonner.
At the other end Andy Walker had a go but knocked the ball into the
side netting.
In the closing minutes Rangers almost stole the points when Laudrup
weaved his way into the box, but Bonner denied him and also Durrant, who
tried to score from the rebound.
RANGERS -- Scott, McCall, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Boli, Huistra,
Ferguson, Durie, Miller, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Brown, Durrant,
Thomson.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Boyd, Gray, O'Neil, Galloway, O'Donnell, Byrne,
McStay, McLaughlin, Walker, Collins. Substitutes -- Nicholas, Hay,
Marshall.
Referee -- J McCluskey (Stewarton).

CELTIC seem to be specialising in draws this season, but they might be
entitled to look upon their 1-1 result at Ibrox as a small triumph given
the youthful nature of their line-up, and immediately after the match,
manager Tommy Burns dedicated the result to his central defender Tony
Mowbray, writes James Traynor.
The Englishman's wife, Bernadette, died on New Year's Day after a long
illness, and Burns said the defender had considered playing for the club
against Rangers.
''It has been a humbling experience for all of us to watch Tony over
the past nine months,'' Celtic's manager said. ''His has been a story of
courage and dedication to his wife. I've never met anyone like him. He's
an incredible man.''
Mowbray's loss puts the often ridiculous hold football can have on
people into proper perspective, but so long as life goes on so, too,
will the ball continue to bounce, and Burns had to talk about the match.
''We didn't play well in the first half, and I can't explain why we
did much better in the second,'' he said.
''We told the midfield players at half time to take more control of
the game and we told the wee fellah (Brian McLaughlin) on the left to
come in and do more than play on the fringes.''
The players responded and Celtic could have won at Ibrox where Burns'
young players like McLaughlin and Stuart Gray may have grown up. ''These
boys had to find out what playing in Old Firm games is all about, and I
thought they did very well,'' said Burns.
''These players are saying, 'we are in the team and we are here to
stay for more than one or two games.' They are making it hard to be left
out.
''However, it was only a draw and we have had too many of those
already. We need firepower like Rangers who will be able to call on
players like Hateley and McCoist.''
Burns disclosed that he had thought about playing Chris Hay instead of
Paul Byrne, but chose the Irishman because ''he tends to do well against
Rangers.'' He did, too, scoring the equalising goal and he said: ''I
enjoy playing against Rangers. Maybe it's the crowd, I don't really
know, but it brings out the best in me.''
Rangers' manager Walter Smith was less enthusiastic about the game,
but he was content with the point which puts his side 11 clear of
second-placed Motherwell.
''Celtic were the better team in the second half and I am disappointed
in the way my team played,'' he said.
''We didn't really get to grips with the game until the last 10 or 15
minutes of the second half.''

THE finest assembly of top teams ever to attend an invitation curling
bonspiel in Scotland will take to the ice tonight at the Stakis Masters
in Perth.
As well as all Scotland's top teams, six Swiss rinks headed up by 1992
world champion Markus Eggler will arrive in Edinburgh ready to compete
for the #7500 prize money, with the top team on Sunday grabbing a #3000
pot.
Last year's champions David Smith and his local team will face sterner
opponents this time round, and they meet Edinburgh's Alan Westwood in
the opening game tonight. Smith is fresh from winning the Veriset Trophy
in Engelberg last month.
The Masters event oozes talent. Also competing are Hammy McMillan and
his Stranraer team, the newly crowned European champions, and the 1991
European champions from Fussen, Germany, Roland Jentsch and his team,
who meet Murrayfield's Peter de Boer in their opening match tonight.
Other Swiss strength is exemplified by Patrick Hurlimann, runner-up at
the world championships in 1989, and Winterthur's Dieter Wuest, bronze
medalist in the 1993 world championships.
The event opens in Perth tonight with a Calcutta -- an auctioning-off
of teams to the highest bidders. Draw:
S Byers (Lockerbie) v G McPherson (Galleon, Kilmarnock); J Dunn
(Stirling) v D Wuest (Switzerland); J Kenny (Kinross) v G Muirhead
(Kinross); P de Boer (Murrayfield) v R Jentsch (Germany); J Muir
(Hamilton) v K Prentice (Kelso); D Smith (Perth) v A Westwood (Gogar
Park); C Hamilton (Livingston) v I Powell (Brora); B Binnie (Letham
Grange) v P Hurlimann (Switzerland); H McMillan (Stranraer) v D Stark
(Forfar); T Brewster (Lockerbie) v R Stockli (Switzerland); Y Renggli
(Switzerland) v S Macnee (Murrayfield); R Gray (Forest Hills) v N Joss
(Aberdeen); N Carrera (Switzerland) v A MacDougall (Greenacres); W Smith

TRAINER John Hill has always been a keen supporter of the all-weather
and his Master Millfield can win the Bird In Hand Handicap over seven
furlongs today at Lingfield, the day's sole surviving meeting.
The son of Prince Rupert had a busy December but appeared to thrive on
racing, winning his first race and going on to complete a hat trick.
He began by taking a maiden auction over course and distance, before
going on to land a pair of nurseries on the Fibresand at Wolverhampton.
On his latest start, his colours were lowered as he went down by
three-and-a-half lengths to Neville Callaghan's Battleship Bruce.
However, Battleship Bruce has gone on to win again and is clearly a
fair horse in this grade, so that effort was anything but a disgrace.
Master Millfield has to shoulder top-weight of 9st 13lb, but talented
apprentice Seb Sanders claims a useful 5lb allowance, and he should be
able to resume winning ways.
Sanders can complete a double, courtesy of Hillsdown Boy in the Many
Hands Limited Stakes over a mile-and-a-quarter.
Simon Dow does very well at this course, and his five-year-old showed
fair form when successful in an amateur riders' handicap over course and
distance in November.
He then improved on that effort when successful in a minor event --
also over course and distance -- and is clearly suited by 10 furlongs on
Equitrack.
Hugh Collingridge's Ballyranter enjoyed a good run towards the end of
1994, and should give the selection the most to do.
Ron Boss and reigning champion Frankie Dettori teamed up to win with
Birequest at Lingfield yesterday, and the combination can repeat the
trick with Fahema in the Stitch In Time Claiming Stakes.

THE US Golf Tour's 1995 programme begins today at the breathtakingly
upmarket La Costa Resort and Spa, north of San Diego, with the Mercedes
championship. The event used to be known as the Tournament of Champions
-- and if that title still existed, it would this time have been
seriously devalued.
To start with, not one winner of last year's four major titles is in
the exclusive field of 30 -- neither Nick Price, the Open and US PGA
Champion and World No.1, nor Jose Maria Olazabal, the Masters Champion,
nor Ernie Els, the US Open Champion. Greg Norman, No.2 in the world, and
David Frost also are not competing.
Since Price won five times on the 1994 tour, Olazabal, fifth on the
global rankings, did so twice, and the three others once each, a huge
hole was punched in the entry for a $1m tournament which used to command
an almost obligatory attendance from those who had qualified for it.
In some ways these absences are a reflection of the odd condition
which the US Tour developed during last season. As has been pointed out
-- among other things and quite gleefully -- for the first time in
modern times, a native-born American has failed to win any of the most
coveted titles.
America's leading players have tended to talk down this surprising
embarrassment. ''It's not a player's country of birth that matters,''
they insist, ''it's who he is and how well he played in gaining his
victory.'' The tone of voice employed is not always entirely convincing.
They are sensitive to the situation, all right. Their attempt to
diminish their anxieties may derive from the fact that since their major
sports -- baseball, gridiron football, ice hockey, and basketball -- are
almost exclusively indigenous, they are not used to the partisan and
passionate support aroused by such international sports as football,
rugby, and cricket.
The decline extended to the tour itself. The first American on the
official money list, Mark McCumber, finished third behind Price and
Norman. Moreover, McCumber is all of 43 years old, Price will be 38 this
month, and Norman is in his fortieth year -- practically in the shadow
of their first brush with the mid-life crisis.
Of the first 15 on the list, three have had their fortieth birthdays
-- Hale Irwin, indeed, is within sight of his fiftieth -- and their
average age is almost 36. That figure would have been reduced a little,
as Olazabal, aged 28, was technically in seventh place but, ironically,
could not be included, for he is not a member of the US Tour.
The only Americans under 30 were Mike Springer (twelfth), Bob Estes
(thirteenth), and, at 24 the group's youngest member, Phil Mickelson,
who was fourteenth. It does seem as if something of a generation gap is
opening up in America -- but then it also has begun to work through on
the European Tour.
At any rate, when Nick Faldo arrives in Tucson later this month to
renew a more prolonged acquaintance with the US Tour than he has had for
several seasons, he will find the gravy jug filled quite high enough for
him to dip his bread to a satisfying depth.
Over the next 10 months 43 official tournaments will be played, a
figure which may be increased if money earned in the Open Championship
at St Andrews is approved as official. When eight non-counting events
are added, the total prize money will amount to $59.5m -- rich pickings
indeed.
Meanwhile, that extraordinary sports phenomenon of the age, the Senior
Tour, goes from strength to strength, with 38 official and six
unofficial tournaments offering a total of $33.3m, and the Nike Tour,
much more modest but still a useful preparatory school for the two
institutions of further education, has 30 tournaments worth $6.1m.

PAT Rafter, Australia's rising star, booked a quarter-final date with
Dutch fourth seed Richard Krajicek by removing compatriot Jamie Morgan
from the Australian men's hard-court championship in Adelaide yesterday.
Rafter, aiming to rise into the world's top 10 in 1995 from his
current twenty-first position, beat Morgan 7-6, 6-3, having already
accounted for Todd Woodbridge in the first round.
The 22-year-old from Queensland, seeded fifth, has just started
working with Ivan Lendl's former coach, Tony Roche, and is already
feeling the benefit. ''I've been working on my ground-strokes with Tony
and I believe that I can see the difference,'' he said.
Krajicek beat another Australian, Richard Fromberg, 7-5, 7-5, while
Germany's Hendrik Dreekmann, first-round conqueror of second seed Wayne
Ferreira, continued his good run with a three-set win over fellow
countryman Carl-Uwe Steeb.

PROSPECTS for the weekend's meetings appear to be mixed, with the
Newton Chase meeting at Haydock looking a good bet to go ahead. The cold
weather has still taken its toll, with only the all-weather card at
Lingfield today surviving the frost which claimed the meetings at
Nottingham and Sedgefield after inspections yesterday morning.
Following the loss of yesterday's scheduled Lingfield jumping fixture,
the total of meetings wiped out by the weather this season is 23 -- 10
of them this week.
At Haydock, clerk of the course Major Philip Arkwright inspected the
course yesterday and the prospects are much better for Saturday's
meeting.
But Sandown Park could not have raced yesterday, according to Andrew
Cooper, clerk of the course and manager at the Esher track, and worse
weather could be on the way.
Snow has been forecast, and that is the threat also to Uttoxeter
tomorrow. Towcester, which had been hopeful about tomorrow, will inspect
at 9am today, as the course was still frozen, but hopes are high for
Warwick on Saturday.

BORIS Becker marked his first appearance for Germany in more than two
years yesterday with 15 aces to steer his country into the Hopman Cup
semi-finals in Perth, Australia.
The world No.3 outclassed Austria's Horst Skoff 6-3, 6-4 after
compatriot Anke Huber had paved the way to a comfortable victory with a
routine 6-1, 6-2 win over Judith Wiesner.
Becker, absent from Germany's Davis Cup squad in recent times, then
made a lighthearted foray into the world of mixed doubles in the final
rubber, clowning around with the ball-boys and attempting to tip the
umpire from his chair.
He was content with his first serious singles of the year. ''Serving
15 aces makes it difficult for my opponent to break me and puts pressure
on him,'' he said.
''I came here to have as many matches as possible . . . it's the first
tournament of the year and you want a good start going into 1995.''
His only doubt concerned the electronic line-calling system. It was
his first experience of the innovation and he is not convinced that it
represents the way forward for tennis.
''It was confusing at the beginning and took me about 25 minutes to
get used to. To be honest I'd rather talk to a human being . . . I hope
they don't have it at all tournaments,'' added Becker.
Germany will meet France in the semi-final. France were handed a
golden opportunity when Wimbledon champion and world No.3 Conchita
Martinez suffered an unexpected 7-6, 7-5 defeat to Julie Halard in the
opening singles.
Jean-Philippe Fleurian, the inspiration behind his country's
first-round win over the Netherlands, was again equal to the task as he
swept aside Alberto Costa 7-5, 6-1 to seal the tie. Quarter-final
results:
Germany 2, Austria 1 (German players first) -- Anke Huber beat Judith
Wiesner 6-1, 6-2; Boris Becker beat Horst Skoff 6-3, 6-4; Huber and
Becker lost to Wiesner and Skoff 7-5, 4-6 (match decided 5-7 in
tie-break after two sets).
France 3, Spain 0 (French names first) -- Julie Halard beat Conchita
Martinez 7-6 (7-5), 7-5; Jean-Philippe Fleurian beat Alberto Costa 7-5,
6-1; Halard and Fleurian beat Martinez and Costa 6-0, 6-0.
* ROSS Matheson and Miles Maclagan both failed to qualify for the
$50,000 ATP Challenger Tournament in Wellington, New Zealand, yesterday.
Matheson, seeded No.4, lost his opening match 6-3, 6-7, 6-4 to American
Kip Brady while Maclagan, the No.7 seed, beat New Zealand's Craig Green
6-0, 6-3 but then went down 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 to New Zealander Glen Wilson.
The Scots pair now head to Auckland in a bid to qualify for a second
challenger event before the Australian Open qualifying in Melbourne.
Jonathan Pankhurst secured his place in the British National
16-and-under championship at Nottingham in March when he won the second
qualifying event at the Buckinghamshire Indoor Tennis Centre yesterday.
The 15-year-old from Kingussie, runner-up in the first qualifying
tournament in Liverpool last month, beat Berkshire's Simon Parker 6-2,
6-2 in the final.
Thistle's Lyndsay Reilly lost 6-0, 6-4 to Durham's Joanne Cunliffe in
the semi-final of the girls' qualifier at Corby.

WHILE Chris Eubank, the World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight
champion, has been constantly criticised for taking the easy option in
most defences of the title, no such charge can be made against fellow
Englishman Nigel Benn, holder of the World Boxing Council's version of
the championship.
And yesterday Benn announced that his next defence -- his seventh --
would be against the hard-hitting Gerald McClellan, of America, at the
London Arena on Saturday, February 25.
It will be the first contest for McClellan at his new weight. The
27-year-old fighter from Detroit relinquished the WBC middleweight crown
after winning consecutive defences in 30, 97 and 83 seconds, the last
one against former champion Julian Jackson in Las Vegas last May.
McClellan has 29 knock-outs or stoppages in his 31 wins -- including
14 in a row -- and undoubtedly will be the toughest opponent Benn has
ever faced.
Of course, the man is not indestructible -- the boxing record books
are strewn with sad tales of those who thought they were. When he won
the title by dethroning Julian Jackson in Las Vegas in May, 1993, on the
same bill that Lennox Lewis beat Tony Tucker for the heavyweight crown,
he was knocked flat by the then champion.
It was, however, the worst thing Jackson could have done, for
McClellan hauled himself off the canvas and pounded the champion to
defeat.
Indeed, McClellan is no stranger to London, and on his other
appearance there, in November, 1991, he showed all his power in taming
John ''The Beast'' Mugabi inside the first round to win the WBO version
of the middleweight title.
I saw the Mugabi destruction, and McClellan's first fight with
Jackson, and was amazed by the sheer power and aggression of the man.
Benn must hope that he doesn't carry that kind of power into the higher
division.
One thing is certain. British fight fans are going to see an
explosive, genuine world title fight at the London Arena. Benn, perhaps
unwisely, has already stated that too many people are scared of
McClellan and that he would be going out to fight, rather than box, the
challenger. It all may not last long, but it will certainly be worth
watching.
Promoter Frank Warren said: ''It will be explosive -- the hardest
fight Benn has had in his career.''
The 31-year-old champion left last night for his training camp in
Tenerife.
On the same bill, Jamacian Mike McCallum defends his WBC
light-heavyweight championship against an opponent still to be named,
and Crawford Ashley defends the British light-heavyweight title against
Maurice Core or Mark Prince.

SCOTLAND'S Laura Hamilton scored two convincing victories to reach
today's semi-finals of the under-16 event at the British Junior Open
Squash Championships at Lamb's Club in London, writes Elspeth Burnside.
The Southport-based No.2 seed beat Cheryl Beaumont, from Yorkshire
9-6, 9-3, 9-2 in the third round, and then trounced Emily Morgans
(Northampton) 9-3, 9-2, 9-1 in the quarter-finals.
She now meet Lincoln's Tanya Bailey, the No.3 seed, for a place in the

Also in the under-19 championship, Kent's Chris Tomlinson, effectively
top seed after the late withdrawal of holder Ahmed Barada of Egypt,
cruised into the semi-finals.
Tomlinson defeated Malaysia's Kenneth Low 9-1, 9-2, 9-5 in 28 minutes
at Lamb's Club and today plays Northumbria's John Dale for a place in
the final.
Dale fought back against Yorkshire's Lee Beachill to win 9-7, 3-9,
8-10, 9-4, 9-2 in 63 minutes.
Iain Higgins of Essex plays Germany's Markus Coppitz in the other
semi-final. Results:
Girls under 19. Third round -- S Shabana (Egypt) beat L McKenna
(Edinburgh Sports Club) 9-6, 9-4, 9-2. Under 16. Third round -- L
Hamilton (Southport) beat C Beaumont (Yorkshire) 9-6, 9-3, 9-2; N Clark

CATHERINA McKiernan, whose status as newly-crowned European
cross-country champion was put in perspective last weekend by a
27-second thrashing from teenage Kenyan Rose Cheruiyot, has changed her
racing plans in the build-up to the World Cross Country championships at
Durham in March.
Ireland's McKiernan, runner-up for the world title for the past three
years, is just one of several athletes to withdraw from Northern
Ireland's biggest athletics event of the year, the World Cross
Challenge, at Mallusk, near Belfast, on Saturday.
The women's race yesterday was down to seven qualified athletes,
leaving angry organisers frantically trying to replace the defectors in
order that the event retains its place on the World Cross calendar.
Attempts to enlist Scots Liz McColgan and Vikki McPherson have drawn a
blank. McColgan withdrew from Durham with a virus, while McPherson,
ninth in that race on Hogmanay, has accountancy exams next week, and
cannot compete.
McKiernan, desperate to improve on three successive silvers, said: ''I
am going to train for two weeks. It's not a question of tiredness.''
Her next race will be another in the IAAF World Cross series, in
Seville on January 22, and a fortnight later, at Tourcoing. In both she
will face Commonwealth Games team captain McPherson, who is hoping for a
fourth successive year in the British team at the world championships.
Cheruiyot and fellow Kenyan Ismael Kirui, last Saturday's men's
winner, are in action at Mallusk, as are six Scots -- Robert Quinn,
Adrian Callan, Graeme Wight, Sue Ridley, Marlene Gemmell and Helene
Diamantides.
* CONTROVERSIAL Chinese coach Ma Junren has lost 16 of his top women
distance runners after disputes over prize money and his stern
discipline, according to a report in an official newspaper yesterday.
Ma, whose runners broke a string of world records in autumn 1993, has
only three athletes left at his training camp in Liaoning Province, said
the Beijing Youth Daily.
They reported a mass exodus, led by Wang Junxia, who set world records
at 3000 and 10,000m in 1993.
Ma is said to have in his posession three Mercedes cars won by his
athletes, and to have spent $824,000 on his training centre out of total
winnings by his athletes of $1.18m.
The walkout followed a fruitless meeting with Ma, which centred on his
distribution of their prize money. They complained they had received
only a portion. Many athletes were reduced to tears, and began secretly
leaving the camp next day.
Ma's seven top male atheletes left following the Asian Games in
October after a dispute over prize money and donations.
* WINNERS of Scottish Universities' titles at the Indoor Championships
three weeks on Saturday qualify to represent the varsities in a match
against Loughbrough and Birmingham, plus teams from Irish Universities
and the Midland AAA.
Entry forms for the universities event, at the Kelvin Hall, are
available from Iain Cosgrove, 25 Burns Drive, Johnstone. PA5 0HA.

DANCING in the streets may have been de rigeur in Scotland's principal
cities this Hogmanay, but on the other side of Europe a Glasgow sound
system was providing the soundtrack for a street party which was an
altogether-braver operation.
The Desert Storm mobile rave joined forces with Nottingham's Full On
Dance Squad to show solidarity with the people of Tuzla, in recognition
of the city's stand against the ethnic nationalism that has swept
through much of the rest of Bosnia. The sound system travelled to Tuzla
with Workers Aid for Bosnia, a charity which openly supports the fragile
democracy in the city, making a 13-day overland journey from Calais.
Christmas Day had been spent in a car park in the former Yugoslavian
holiday resort of Split. A DIY nightclub had been constructed and a
party provided for refugees, NGO personnel and UN soldiers.
But New Year's Eve in Tuzla was the real goal, and an evening in a
local venue had been scheduled. When the Glasgow team arrived, however,
they were told that it had been cancelled because of fear of bombing.
Undeterred, Desert Storm decided that if the people couldn't come to the
music the music would have to go the people, and set up the PA and
lights on the back of an open-topped 17-ton truck.
The mobile rave set off from the Hotel Tuzla, where UN personnel are
separated from real life in the city in art-deco splendour. While the
sound system was still warming up, the hotel management came out to
complain. However, when the music was turned down as they requested, the
local police intervened, insisting that it be turned up.
With the latest underground house music pumping out of the
loudspeakers and lasers, and strobe lights mixing with tracer fire in
the misty night air, the truck set off for the centre of town. No-one
knew how this cultural invasion would be received, but smiles and waves
from windows slowly gave way to a presence on the otherwise-deserted
streets. The mobile party played Pied Piper to the people of Tuzla,
young and old, as it wound its way through the town. Some were content
to follow behind, others climbed on board to watch the live mixing of
the DJs.
The first stop was made outside the town hall in the cobbled old town,
the flashing blue light of a police car adding to the show as the driver
jumped out and joined the dancing throng.
At a high-rise housing estate further on, a crowd of 100 gathered
within minutes, the smoke machine was turned on, and the square became
an arena of throbbing colour, in stark contrast to the austere housing
all around.
Another housing scheme brought forth an even larger crowd -- including
a Bosnian soldier who fired off a volley from his AK47 to welcome the
New Year as he stood silhouetted against the lights. His ''friendly
fire'' was not unique, but attracted the attention of some less
sympathetic policemen. By then it was 5am and the music was wound down
and the crowd dispersed.
None the less, there was a feeling among the Desert Storm ''posse''
that the mission to entertain had been a success on the streets of Tuzla
-- as well as an ironic appreciation that such an undertaking would have
been illegal on British streets because of the measures in the new
Criminal Justice Act.

Elizabeth Clark tunes in to a composer committed to changing the world
through his music, and is prepared
to be confrontational and controversial to achieve this
THERE now follows a party political broadcast by Steve Martland of the
Music Lovers' Party. ''The world could not exist without music. It's
important to do something you think can change the world. Music does
that -- it affects our imagination and how we see the world.
''Music plays some part in every person's life and, until the people
who make things happen in society recognise that, nothing will change.''
With every utterance, it is clear that Martland takes his music very
seriously and nothing, but nothing, will stand in his way. His music is
confrontational, his words are outspoken and his actions often nothing
short of outrageous. Later this month, Scotland will get the chance to
see this upfront character in the flesh when he brings his own band to
Edinburgh and Glasgow for two spectacular showdowns.
The role of the composer in society is something to which Martland has
given a lot of thought. Not wishing to appear to inhabit an ivory tower
of composition, he is heavily involved in music education. Suggesting
that the music teaching which takes place in schools puts children off,
he has sought other ways to get young people involved.
''I don't ever talk about classical music. There are all sorts of
approaches about how you get kids to write music but, by and large, it's
just to say to them that they're all composers now and they can do
something. It works out brilliantly in the pieces they come out with.''
It was while working on one of these education projects that Martland
first met John Stanley -- then an A-level music student more interested
in techno and dance music than anything remotely classical. However,
with a little gentle persuasion and a lot of encouragement, Stanley has
already, at the tender age of 19, made his mark on the contemporary
scene.
In fact, the Scottish concerts will include a performance of Stanley's
hypnotic piece for two marimbas, Spire, first performed at last summer's
Meltdown Festival at London's South Bank Centre. Martland is
enthusiastic: ''It was written while he was at school and it's a
terrific piece.''
Rebelling against the established institution of the symphony
orchestra, he decided it was not performances and commissions, but doing
exactly what he wanted that mattered. The obvious route to this was to
form his own Steve Martland Band.
He explains: ''No-one else was doing my music, hence the band. Bach
and Mozart did it -- it's an honourable tradition. In fact it's more of
an orthodoxy than the orchestras who commission composers to write
things for them, but they're cultural elitists and don't see it that
way.''
Selected from a diverse group of musicians, the members are all
classically trained but practice in jazz, rock, folk and pop. Totally
committed to the band, their mentor is particularly proud: ''I'm
amazingly lucky to have this group of people who are interested in my
music and want to play it and talk about it.''
Is there a danger, however, of an in-house band becoming too
introverted? ''It's an on-going ensemble dedicated to new music around a
certain aesthetic. We'd like to do more music by other composers and
contribute something to British musical life.''
The concerts in Edinburgh and Glasgow will feature a selection of
Martland hits including the impressive four-movement Dance Works,
written for the London Contemporary Dance Theatre. Rich, imaginative and
intended to be performed with striking dynamic contrasts, it will shock,
surprise and ultimately satisfy any fan of new music.
Also featured is his 1992 string quartet Patrol, which will be
performed by new music peer-group The Smith Quartet. A large-scale
composition, it accommodates both sides of Martland's musical mind:
rhythmic dynamism and eerie lyricism. Is this his most eclectic piece?
''I'm not in favour of artificial fusions of styles -- you must find a
personal style like nobody else's.''
Martland's band and the Smith Quartet will join forces for the finale
-- a mouthwatering and undoubtedly noisy rendition of a track by the
group Madness. It is tempting to speculate that it might be the manic
ska of One Step Beyond.
Martland is eagerly anticipating the Edinburgh and Glasgow
appearances. ''I want people to come to my concerts who might never have
heard of me, but think this sounds like an interesting night, or might
have heard of me and want to hear the next thing.'' Accept the
invitation and marvel at a musical maverick.

ANXIOUS Fife Flyers chiefs are locked in talks in a bid to secure a
new defenceman before this weekend's tough, on-the-road ice hockey
double-header, and the loss of Canadian Ryan Kummu has been a blow to
their title hopes.
American Lee Saunders played in the 9-2 victory over Canadian tourists
McGill on Monday and he may continue to trial, at league champions
Cardiff Devils on Saturday and at Milton Keynes 24 hours later,
depending on his club, Lee Valley, giving him the nod.
Flyers are also talking to other players at home and abroad.
Team manager Stewart Saunders -- no relation -- said: ''Lee did well
against McGill and he knows our situation. If Lee Valley give him his
release for the weekend and he plays well, then we may sign him.''
Meanwhile Kummu still has a swollen jaw following surgery on Christmas
Day after having received a puck in the face at a training session.
The team manager added: ''We don't know how long he will be out. He
will not be rushed back into action.''
Once again fixture organisers have deprived Scots fans of premier
division action this weekend. Edinburgh Racers also are away from home,
visiting Basingstoke on Saturday and Bracknell on Sunday.
Marksman Danuse Bauba scored four goals as Paisley Pirates beat
tourists McGill 8-4 in a challenge last night.

SCOTTISH athletics faces severe budget restrictions in the current
year. Although grant aid from the Scottish Sports Council has been
increased to #117,000, that falls some #100,000 short of projected
expenditure by the various commissions, writes Doug Gillon.
The World Mountain Racing Cup, to be staged in Edinburgh, needs
#45,000 in sponsorship, despite the promise of an extra #15,000 from the
SSC. And a track international Scotland is due to host, against Turkey,
Israel, and Wales, will cost #26,000.
Despite that, the road running and cross-country commission has agreed
to take on the Celtic Nations event for the fourth successive year.
Ireland, due to host this year's event, in Dublin, declined because of
financial problems.
Irvine Development Corporation again have agreed to support the match,
while Tayside Region will under-write the national championships, in
Perth.
A team of 80 will go to the Inter-county championships a week on
Saturday, at a cost of #3500. The contingent of 40 will go to the
women's Inter-league match at Leeds largely at their own expense.
''I would not describe it as a crisis,'' said Bob Greenoak, secretary
of the Scottish Athletics Federation, ''but the individual branches of
the sport must decide on their priorities.'' The budget meeting is later
this month.
* THE British Athletic Federation's management board will discuss
tomorrow the composition of a panel to hear Diane Modahl's appeal
against a four-year ban for drug-taking. A BAF disciplinary hearing
found the former Commonwealth 800m champion guilty three weeks ago.
Modahl, who declared immediately afterwards that she would fight on to
clear her name, insists: ''I have never taken any banned substance.''
* THE former European 400m champion, Grit Breuer, eligible to run
again this August after a three-year doping ban, plans to compete at
next year's Atlanta Olympics.
* COLIN Jackson, who won all of his hurdles races last year, launches
his 1995 campaign for Britain in the McDonald's International against
Russia at Birmingham's national indoor arena on January 28. Tony Jarrett
and John Regis have also been confirmed for the team, which will be
named in full next week.

HAVING been left somewhat high and dry by Scottish Television, Susan
Maxwell, former co-host of NB and co-presenter of Trial by Night, has
flown off to LA to join Faith Liddle, much-loved press officer for the
Edinburgh Fringe who packed it all in, packed her bags and took to the
road for a year out after last summer's arts bonanza.
The girls are taking a trans-American car trip. A Thelma and Louise
odyssey of self-discovery, perchance? ''Sure, as long as I get to kiss
Brad Pitt,'' says Maxwell.
With no firm plans they're heading wherever their mood takes them, but
the offices of Playboy are not on the route. Despite her celeb (albeit
minor league) status, Maxwell is not following in the footsteps of the
likes of Marilyn Monroe, Madonna and Kim Basinger by baring all in the
pursuit of fame.
Okay, Hugh Hefner hasn't exactly been down on bended knee but Maxwell
has had calls to be a centrefold. Before leaving Caledonian shores she
knocked back entreaties from Bigwig magazine to grace their centre
spread in her birthday suit.
Maxwell deliberated, awhile, then decided she didn't want her career
to plunge down that path. ''They said I could cover up bits of me with
some fruit or something, but I assured them they would end up with more
fruit than flesh.''
Lyn McNicol, editor of the music mag, reckons Maxwell took the
cowardly option.
''For the last issue the staff of Bigwig posed for the centrefold, to
show up people like Susan, Lulu and Janice Forsyth who were all too
chicken to do it.'' John Coletta, lead singer with The Humpff Family was
brave enough to strip off for the first issue, although a
strategically-placed bible protected his modesty somewhat.
The shoe retailers Schuh are sponsoring the centrefold for the next
six issues and McNicol is searching for male contenders. ''We're
desperately looking for a bloke of some stature,'' she says, adding
coyly. ''I mean fame-wise of course. It's tastefully done, they just
have to have the balls to do it.''
Zig and Zag were apparently game but were ruled out on the grounds
that ''they have no bottoms'' while Fish agreed in principle but
obviously couldn't quite grasp the centrefold concept. ''He wanted to do
it with his clothes on,'' sighs McNicol.
In true Hefner style, McNicol insists posing nude is a worthy artistic
statement. ''Roger Moore appeared on the Des O'Connor show recently and
said that he had always regretted not having done was a centrefold
spread,'' she points out.
''We promptly invited him to pose for us but his agent phoned back and
said he wouldn't even waste his breath relaying the offer to him.''
Potential exhibitionists ''of some stature'' can volunteer their
sevices to McNicol at the Bigwig office on 041 204 3929.
THE festive season may be over, but the Arts Dairy has a belated
parlour game suggestion, inspired by the nefarious acquisiton of a
highly-confidential fax from the Scot FM news offices, which sets out
guidleines for news coverage in the event of the Queen Mother's death --
an event which is regularly anticipated in the media with all the
certainty of tomorrow's sunrise.
The ''Scot FM Obituary Procedure'' begins somewhat irreverantly with
''unless the Queen Mum keels over suddenly in public,'' and goes on to
gravely warn broadcasters of songs which would be unsuitable at this
time. The station's executives reckon Killer Queen should be avoided at
all costs. The Arts Diary suggests that The Smith's The Queen is Dead
should also be given the cold shoulder on the grounds that it is
offensive to the monarchy. Worst of all however would be Grandma by the
St Winifred's School Choir. On the grounds that it is crap.
FOLLOWING the success of their Arts Conference earlier this year, BBC
Scotland's Music and Arts Department is hosting an open day on January
12. The event is aimed at arts administrators, press officers and
artistic directors and hopes to enlighten the local arts populace about
the Beeb's strategies for arts coverage.
The year has see much coming and going of staff, most notably Donny
O'Rourke's surprising departure, and the open day intends to clarify
who's who within the department -- this week at least -- and encourage
the arts community to punt much-needed programme ideas. Anyone wishing
to attend should contact Shirley Whiteside on 041-339-8844.

THE world's largest Burns Supper will this year celebrate its 10th
birthday when 1000 people will gather on Saturday, January 14, at the
Hospitality Inn, Glasgow, for the West Sound Radio's Burns Supper.
The 1000 will come, quite literally, ''frae a' the airts'' including
Russia, the United States and Japan.
''We did not intend it ever to be this way when we started,'' admitted
the man behind it all, West Sound manager Joe Campbell.
''I suppose I can only say that it was like Topsy. From the very
beginning it just grew.''
This year's Burns Supper will have author and columnist Jack Webster,
of the Herald, proposing the Immortal Memory. The Toast to the Lasses
will be by Buff Hardie, of Scotland the What, with the reply by Mamie
Magnusson.
The line-up of artistes taking part includes Kenneth McKellar and
soprano Isobel Buchanan with readings by Tom Fleming.
The 1000 guests, each paying #40 a head to be present, will include
many who have attended every one of the West Sound Burns Suppers since
they were inaugurated in 1986.
Busloads arrive from all over Scotland and the North of England. The
event is an established international highlight for Burns enthusiasts,
and far ahead as the largest estimated half a million Burns Suppers the
Burns Federation say are now probably held throughout the world.
''It is all quite staggering that our Burns Supper is the largest,''
said Joe Campbell. ''Looking back, we decided in 1985 that West Sound,
being in the heart of Burns Country, should hold its own special Burns
Supper in 1986 to mark the bicentenary of the first edition of the
Kilmarnock edition of Burns's poems being published by John Wilson and
Sons in Kilmarnock in 1786.
''We thought we could hold it in an Ayr hotel and that we might
attract some 200 people.''
Moira Anderson was invited to take part. She suggested that John
Cairney could toast the Immortal Memory. He was joined by Andy Stewart
in what rapidly became a roll call of stars wanting to take part.
Eventually, outgrowing any Ayrshire hotel in size, the event was held
in the Hospitality Inn with 1000 guests and it has been located there
ever since.
''Over the years, our speakers have ranged from politicians like
Edward Heath, John Smith, and Malcolm Rifkind, to the hostage Tom
Sutherland who came very soon after his release in the Lebanon.
''Johnnie Walker whisky have been with us as main sponsors since Day
One. Other particularly supportive sponsors have included Aviall
Caledonian Engine Services, the International Aero engine maintaince
firm based at Prestwick.''
The West Sound event succeeds in combining quality with its quantity
throughout.
In 1990, when a group of 40 Russians Burns enthusiasts flew in from
Moscow, the result was an invitation which resulted in Joe Campbell
taking out the singers and entertainers to present a Burns Supper in the
Kremlin.
The gathering, which he chaired, was a Burns Supper for 800 people
held in the Palace of Congresses, the first social event to be held in
that building. Haggis was brought out from Scotland.
Things have not stopped there. This year, the West Sound singers and
entertainers will again be on the move. They have been invited out to
Denver, Colorado, where on January 28 the former Lebanon hostage Tom
Sutherland has organised a Burns Supper for the St Andrews Society of
Colorado. It will be attended by 750 guests.
''We are delighted at the way our Burns Supper is now recognised,''
said Joe Campbell. ''But I personally feel even greater pleasure at the
way in which I feel that each year in addition to entertaining
established Burns afficionados, we are also introducing the poems and
songs to more and more young people.
''To be at one of these suppers, to see these young people sit in
absolute total silence as they listen, totally caught up, is a
phenomenon of which I am totally proud.
''This year too we look forward to seeing The Young Burnsian of the
Year Award, a West Sound trophy given to the Burns Federation, presented
to the young violinist Gillian Risi, of Dundee, by our chairman Bill
Mowat.
''People of all ages, of all nationalities, some in corporate groups,
some in Burns clubs, but very many simply private individuals come
together in a way that richly encourages us.''

AS the NYOS stepped on to the stage for last night's concert, anxiety
overcame my excitement as I considered the future of this fabulous
outfit. At present Scotland has an enviable music education system but
Government-proposed cuts in provision and staffing stand to threaten the
existence of this and every other youth orchestra in the country.
On this occasion NYOS were under the reliable baton of Bramwell Tovey.
Sadly reliability doesn't drive a youth orchestra. They need the energy
and dynamism of, dare I say it, a more youthful conductor. None the
less, in a rich programme of R. Strauss, Dvorak, Elgar, and Brahms, they
played intelligently and with complete conviction.
Elgar's sumptuous Sea Pictures fared the best, atmospheric and
wholesome from mezzo-soprano Jane Irwin. Maturity of expression emerged
in the subtle backdrop from the orchestra.
Brahms's First Symphony suffered at the hands of Tovey; lacking
cohesion but not without some terrific playing, especially from the wind
section, oboist Andrew Dickie featuring in a handful of impressive
solos.
An orchestra of this calibre and of vital importance to young
musicians must not be disbanded. Go and give them your support tonight
in Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, kick off 7.30pm.

CATHERINE Munroe adopted Paul when he was 10. ''I had never heard of
attachment disorder until a year ago, despite being mum for six years to
a son who obviously has it,'' she said.
She is a lioness of a woman, whose blonde mane belies the ferocity of
her protective maternal instinct. Paul is one of these deeply disordered
children. He looks very attractive and can charm visitors and strangers
with aplomb, but when people get close to him, he becomes a monster.
Catherine and her husband knew something of his history and that he
had been abused both physically and sexually by both parents, but were
not prepared for the awful can of worms inside his soul which was
revealed in violent temper tantrums which could go on for hours, in
verbal abuse and inappropriate sexual behaviour, usually unleashed on
Catherine when she was alone with him.
''They learn very early to manipulate. For example, they can spend all
day being horrible to mother and when father gets home behave perfectly
well so that he cannot see a problem and thinks it is mother's fault,''
she added.
Despite enormous understanding and patience not only by Catherine and
Neil but by schools and teachers, Paul eventually had to go to a
residential school. Even they could not cope and he was sent to a
residential school in England. When he was 15 they thought he should
return to normal life, but by that time mainstream school was out of the
question. He is now attending college while living at home with
Catherine and has already gained a number of Scotvec certificates.
He has expressed an ambition to be an ambulance driver -- a choice
which Catherine is keen to encourage, because he has demonstrated that
he has a cool head in an emergency and she feels this could be a
positive way to use the adrenalin surge he needs. The alternative could
well be trying to capture the same buzz from crime.
''He now has the choice. I know he is aware of being drawn in
different directions, but I have given him the possibility of living a
useful life which his original background denied him,'' said Catherine.
It is not yet a happy ending, and to get even this far the price has
been high. Catherine and Neil separated within two years of adopting
Paul.
Catherine, Paul and Neil Munroe are pseudonyms

Only in the past year has attachment disorder been recognised as a
specific problem affecting a small group of children with severe
difficulties. In the worst cases they cannot form any lasting, loving
relationships, they fail to develop a conscience, and cannot bring
themselves to trust anyone. Some will habitually tell 'crazy' lies, some
are preoccupied with fire, blood and gore, some chatter incessantly and
nonsensically. Many of them have been taken into care and then adopted
and it is their adoptive parents who now know most about the disorder
and are pleading for it to be recognised and tackled by the
professionals.
Jennifer Cunningham reports.
THEY behave outrageously, they will not look you in the eye, they make
no distinction between truth and lies, they manipulate situations to set
one parent against the other, they turn the ordinary, stable lives of
their families into a chaos of violence and distrust to the point where
they separate loving partners.
In spite of everything, again and again their parents go the extra
mile to support them, not because they are their own flesh and blood,
but because they have taken them on with all their faults and will do
whatever they can to bring forth the beloved but frightened inner child
of whom they have had only the briefest glimpses.
''Adoptive parents do not give up easily,'' says Beth Gibb, Glasgow
co-ordinator for Parent to Parent Information on Adoption Services. The
long-established support group for adoptive parents has found that,
despite the bank of experience they can now draw on, the problems are
becoming more intractable.
Slowly it has become clear that many of the children who have been
adopted in recent years suffered severe neglect or abuse at the baby and
toddler stage. Nowadays, children only become free for adoption after
every possible means of keeping them with their natural parents has been
attempted. The final breakdown follows compulsory care -- and those
measures are not taken lightly.
Some of these children find it almost impossible to live with any
family, however caring, kind, generous and loving. It is as if they need
to have it proved to them that, no matter how awful they are, they will
still be loved.
Only recently has the day-to-day hell they create come to be known as
attachment disorder. It is caused in the first three years of life when
an infant is totally dependent on adults to meet his needs for food,
warmth, shelter, and nurturing, and the trust he has in them, on which
his very life depends, has been broken. He has learned that his survival
depends on never giving anyone that kind of trust again.
Sometimes apparently successful adoptions come to grief in later
years, with adolescence the inevitable danger time. Often, 13 and
14-year-old boys pose the biggest problems, but girls can also have
severe difficulties. It now affects so many families that Catherine
Munroe and Beth Gibb have recently set up a support group for parents
with children with attachment disorder through PPIAS, the support
network for adoptive parents.
It is well-known that there are few babies under the age of two
available for adoption. Beth and Catherine believe that any child who is
adopted at more than a few weeks old can suffer from attachment disorder
and it is found not only in children who have been abused, but also in
those who have not had their needs met and even in those well cared for
but who have suffered a lot of pain, for example with chronic ear
infections.
''These children want to be in control. They won't be cuddled, for
example, unless it is on their terms, not the adult's. They feel that if
they can be in control, maybe they can stop further abuse from
happening,'' says Beth.
Catherine adds: ''They have a complete lack of conscience. In normal
children conscience develops between the ages of two and ten and they go
through the stage of saying they will not do something they know to be
wrong because 'my mother will kill me'. All that changes if your mother
has very nearly killed you. They have survived the worst possible thing
that could happen to them and so no consequences of their actions can be
worse than what they have already gone through.''
It is tempting to label them ''children from hell'', but that is
exactly where most of them did come from. They had the misfortune to be
born to inadequate, drunken, drug-taking, or just vicious parents --
whose neglect and abuse came to light too late.
Attachment disorder is now recognised in the US. In the UK, most of
the expertise has been built up by parents who, in despair at the lack
of understanding and help from social workers, have found support from
each other. They are now moving on to offering practical steps for
parents to take. There is now an attachment and bonding centre in Ohio
and another in Colorado to which a few British parents have gone in
desperation.
In the UK, adoptive parents are still struggling to convince social
workers and psychologists that this is a recognised syndrome.
One of the manifestations of the disorder is ''crazy lying'', which
will inevitably be found out, but often not before it has brought in a
whole range of authorities and their attendant bureaucracies.
There are children who have recognised that they can use accusations
of abuse as a weapon. In the present climate, the authorities act
swiftly and parents find they have to defend themselves against false
accusations.
So isolated do some of these parents feel that they have now formed a
support group among themselves. One says: ''Adoptive parents are warned
to expect some bed-wetting and possibly some hoarding of food in the
early days, but you expect to be able to get through these.
''What people do not tell you when you adopt is that you can end up
paying fines for children who commit offences, or if they are taken into
residential care you may have to pay the cost of that until they are 18,
or that you can end up in court falsely accused of abusing your
children.''

SO it wasn't the Waltons. If you want the truth about the taut
emotional lines of families flung together over the holiday, pass the
wine bottle and listen to women talking. Women talk to make connections,
men to pass the time. The party in the dregs of the festive days is
filled with the sound of men's voices making small talk. Minimalist
stuff. How was it for you? Fine, fine! Quiet! You know!
Susie, in remorse and a lovely hat, dispenses with all the drivel
about the warmth of the holiday hearth to tell it as it was: ''The telly
was dry as bones, the turkey was worse. There was so much tension about
the house was quivering.'' So is she.
The floppy brim does not quite hide the exhaustion ingrained like
mascara rings round her eyes. She may look as if somebody's whacked her.
But she did it to herself. As we all do. Too many expectations, too much
effort. If a cynic is a frustrated romantic, Christmas and Hogmanay goes
some way to explain the transition. That, and age probably.
It is a truism that as you get older parties get smaller and start
earlier and earlier: okay it's ten past eight -- when are these people
going to go home. Not, you understand, that the rules about what
constitutes a good thrash have ever been clearly explained. On the other
hand, rotten bashes are easy to define and impossible to forget.
If you are three, the main battle is to avoid bursting into tears
before the cake is cut. Add three or so decades and the main battle is
to avoid bursting into tears before the second cousin of an acquaintance
who appeared from nowhere, bearing a bottle of Tio Pepe, weaves off
half-cut into the dawn light. The very light that causes small children
to spring ferociously to life.
There are some general tips on how to be the life and soul of the
party. It is absolutely vital not to go around putting cans in a black
bin bag, ask people to sign a petition, or screen a video of yourself
giving birth. As the pink tinge of morning touches the sky, though,
these may be considered necessary devices to decant stragglers and
ensure two minutes kip before small children spot the dawn.
In between the two ages, somewhere around student level, there seems
to be a level of destruction which is acceptable even if not advisable.
Such parties conform to a strict pattern. You cannot start a party until
after the pubs shut. There is always the unknown guest who tags along
promising to break back into his secure accommodation before parents
return. The intense, interesting-looking man turns out to be a sullen
former mercenary, nursing a can of Red Stripe and deep paranoia, in the
corner. But I thought he was with you?
Then, you had to step carefully over people having sex on the stairs.
Somebody, usually the very one who was drinking pints of Southern
Comfort and blackcurrant, will be sick into the Hush-Puppies handily
parked in the hall cupboard. At five thirty, the Young Conservative whom
nobody will admit to having brought will still be trying to mount the
china dalmation on the stair landing.
Nowadays, thankfully, most terrible parties are full of couples. They
will not, therefore, have sex on the stairs, or at all to listen to the
confiding talk which grows more expansive by the glass. Of home-made
punch.
There will inevitably be a Bernard, with a silly voice, who believes,
with the benefit of no evidence whatsoever, that he would have cramped
Oscar Wilde's style: '' . . . did I see you at Gavin and Shirl's
barbecue last summer . . . woof, woof, did you see that little cracker .
. . or was it the yacht club?'' Not in a year of Januaries mate, you
think, but never ever say. Because the protocol of awful parties insists
that you must polish up your grimace to a rictus of a smile. Even when
somebody spills tandoori on the silk skirt. Even when an impeccably
styled, exquisite, playing kissy-kissy round the room, wafts your way
and stares pointedly at the tandoori stain on the silk skirt.
Or you become wedged beside the hi-fi, Phil Collins moaning in one
ear, the other assaulted by one of those fortunate women with total
recall who gives an animated account of any argument, playing both
parts: ''So she told me that she had said to him, and he just said to me
. . .'' It is, you will discover, possible to warm to Phil Collins.
Truly.
Still, hope and parties spring eternal. There's always next year.

<RECORDNO>980517074</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SOLDIER who ripped out two of a 16-month-old boy's toenails was
yesterday described by a judge as a sadist.
Michael Pikesley, 25, was jailed at Exeter Crown Court after being
convicted last month of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on
the boy.
Pikesley, of Honiton, Devon, a private in the Coldstream Guards, was
jailed for six years for that offence by Judge Graham Neville.
He was also given a four-month term, to run consecutively, for
breaching a two-year conditional discharge imposed for causing bodily
harm to the same child when he previously had been looking after him
when he was six months old.
Pikesley, who committed the latest offence days after coming home on
leave from Bosnia over Christmas 1993, sat with his head in his hands
after sentence was passed. It will mean his dismissal from the Army.
The judge said that on the most recent occasion, Pikesley had pulled
out two of the boy's toenails ''with something like a pair of pliers''.
He added: ''The only purpose of doing that was to inflict extreme pain
on that baby.''
The child must have been in agony, the judge said.
Defence counsel Richard Rains said a loss of temper was the only
sensible explanation he could offer.
But the judge said: ''That was not temper at all. That was sadism, the
desire to hurt other human beings. I have got to protect children from
sadism.''
During the trial, the court heard that Pikesley was looking after the
child while the mother was at work.
He claimed he had found the child with the nails hanging off and had
removed them before bathing and bandaging them.

THE Braer oil spill disaster, which struck Shetland two years ago
today, has so far cost #39m in compensation, it was revealed yesterday.
Islanders still have another year to submit claims to the
International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund.
The largest proportion has gone to the islands' salmon farmers who
have received almost #21m. Fish processing claims amount to #3m and the
fish catching industry has so far received around #5.25m.
Other pay-outs include approved claims for damage to property caused
by the oil spill which come to just under #6m; farming accounts for just
under #1m; voluntary services and clean-up costs #200,000; and tourism
has so far received #77,000.
At this time last year, the fund had approved around #20.3m in claims.
A spokesman for the fund, which has moved its office from Shetland to
Aberdeen, said yesterday that claims were still coming in, mainly for
damaged property.
Islanders are continuing their campaign for action to make the
Shetland coastline safer.
Dr Jonathan Wills, vice-chairman of Shetland Islands' Council marine
operations committee, said: ''Two years after the Braer, we still don't
have a salvage tug based in Shetland or permanent radar.
''We've had two radar surveys which have shown there is a problem, as
we always said.
''These are British waters, not just Shetland waters, and it is the
responsibility of the British Government to safeguard the interests of
the fishermen, tourism and everyone. They are not doing it and I'm not
very impressed.''

FORMER fugitive Ronnie Knight is hoping to make a fortune from a film
about his life story -- sums considerably more than his share from the
proceeds from the Shoreditch raid which allowed him to live the good
life on Spain's Costa del Crime for almost 11 years.
This time, he has told friends, the money will be legitimate and it
will enable him to have a happy retirement, living wherever he wants.
Knight, now aged 60, is hoping that film moguls will jump at the
chance and provide him with much more than a pension once he is released
from prison, almost certainly before he reaches his 65th birthday.
Ronnie Knight has worked out that at most he will have to serve only
four more years.
He has already considered who should play the starring role. According
to sources he believes the best actors to portray him are Ian McShane,
star of Lovejoy, or Roger Daltrey, from McVicar.

HAVING given up a luxury villa overlooking the Mediterranean for the
more basic facilities of a prison cell, Ronnie Knight has been playing
his cards close to his chest and keeping to himself his reasons for
finally surrendering to British justice.
The fact that he had spent all of the money he received from the
proceeds of the biggest ever-cash robbery in British criminal history of
its day, plus the fact that his 89-year-old mother, Nellie, was
suffering from the latter stages of Parkinson's disease, seemed
sufficient reasons for him finally to give himself up.
Knight was not prepared to offer any explanation as to why he should
have been paid so handsomely, upwards of #300,000, from the proceeds of
the robbery when he was not one of those directly involved in the armed
raid.
In the dock of Court 16 at the Old Bailey was a man whose past had
finally caught up with him.
The pallor of a category ''A'' prisoner was in direct contrast to his
suntan of May last year when, full of Rupert Murdoch Champagne and
bravado, he stepped down the stairs of a Lear jet into the arms of
Scotland Yard flying squad detectives.
Knight was arguably Britain's most notorious fugitive.
Yesterday as he began his seven-year sentence for his role in handling
money from the #6m raid at the Security Express headquarters in
Shoreditch, east London, in 1963, he looked anything but the tabloid's
portrait of a swashbuckling figure who had snubbed his nose at justice
and for the past 11 years had enjoyed the Dolce Vita on the Costa del
Sol.
He remained expressionless as sentence was passed. That too was in
direct contrast to the smiles of the Scottish officers from the
Metropolitan Police flying squad who had been on his tail for all of
these years and at long last reckoned they had got a good result.
Certainly Knight was getting fed up with his role as an exile in
Spain, especially when the money dried up. Unquestionably he did want to
see his mother at least one more time before she died in her nursing
home.
His 1987 marriage to former barmaid Sue Haylock from Cambridgeshire,
attended in Spain by a lot of burly men in ill-fitting suits, was also
turning sour now that the money had gone.
However, former associates back in the UK reckoned there had to be one
other overwhelming reason why Knight should decide to return to Britain
to face the music.
One theory going the rounds last night was that he had made many
enemies. It was reckoned that he had become a target and successful
''hits'' on others by UK gangsters in Spain had finally persuaded him
that perhaps now was the time for him to return home.
Detectives who had been hard on his tail smiled when asked if when
Knight arrived at Luton Airport he seemed to be a worried man. They
replied: ''You better ask him that.''
Detective Superintendent Iain Malone, from Twynholme, near Castle
Douglas, commented: ''Certainly he has aged considerably since he
arrived in this country last May.''

THE Scottish detective leading the investigation in the 12-year-long
inquiry into the #6m Security Express raid said last night that four
fugitives remained at large and the hunt would continue until they had
been brought to justice.
Detective Superintendent Iain Lawson, of Scotland Yard's Flying Squad,
said: ''They know who they are.
''The Flying Squad will continue the operation until they are all
accounted for,'' Mr Lawson, originally from Twynholme, near Castle
Douglas, added.
The seven-year jail term passed on Knight for his role in the armed
raid -- during which one guard was forced to hand over a key to a money
vault after petrol was poured over his trousers and a match set alight
-- was in line with previous sentences delivered in the case, he said.
In particular, it was linked with a nine-year sentence passed on
gangster Freddie Foreman, a former associate of the Kray twins, four
years ago.
He had been put aboard a plane to Britain by Spanish police following
a fracas.
Sentencing Knight yesterday, the Old Bailey judge allowed him two
years off his sentence because he had returned voluntarily to the UK and
because, unlike Foreman, he had admitted a charge of receiving money
from the robbery.
The outstanding warrants are understood to concern Knight's wife
Susan; Mr Clifford Saxe; Mr John Mason; and Mr Ronald Everitt.Three of
them were mentioned in court yesterday.
Mr Lawson said yesterday that it had been rumoured for some time that
Knight wanted to return to Britain to face the music, but the police
were never prepared at any stage to come to any kind of deal.
There was no doubt that all money he had received from the robbery had
now gone, he added.
He was delighted with the outcome of the hearing.
Superintendent Reid McGeorge, originally from Ayr, who had been
involved in the investigation from the outset, also was delighted with
the outcome.

Hooglapara
IT WAS a big day for Mr Ali yesterday. A small, bony fragile man, he
was being visited by very important people who had come to see his fish
pond.
The village had turned out in force, the women shimmering in orange,
yellow, scarlet, and green saris, small boys dodging the attentions of
the village policeman who kept giving them a clip behind the ear.
The visitors found the day hot. Mr Ali, however, was cold. He was
wearing a crimson short-sleeved woollen pullover above his blue checked
lunghi and yellow shirt. He shook everybody's hand and, since he did not
speak English, was clearly bemused by all the fuss.
The point was that Mr Ali, a poor Bangladeshi farmer, is a success
story in which Britain's overseas aid programme has played its part.
That was why Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Britain's High
Commissioner in Bangladesh, Mr David Fowler, were watching his family
net the pool for fish in this remote provincial village.
They had come from the North West Fisheries extension farm at
Parbatipur where farmers are taught how to breed fish in pools, using
specially imported carp from the Yangtze river in China, and how to grow
rice and cultivate fish in the same paddy field. It is an ecologically
friendly combination.
Mr Ali spent two years at the project learning how to operate his
pond, which he has run on his own for a year. It means he is a
prosperous man in a village where a farmer expects to earn some #80 a
year. The project is run by the Bangladesh Government but 87% of the
funding comes from Britain.
Mr Hurd, who had flown by helicopter to Parbatipur from the capital
Dhaka, was deeply impressed. He was seeing the unglamorous,
non-televisual side of Britain's aid programme. It is aid which does
good on the ground, not aid which applies a sticking plaster for a day
or two while the crisis subsides and until the world's media move on.
CNN will never come here.
His next visit was to the village of Gobindapur, where he saw a
programme run by an organisation called Brac which, with British help,
teaches village women family planning methods and how to rear poultry
and cultivate silkworms.
It was a day for meeting people who spend their lives on the edge of
survival. A drought, a flood, a lost crop, will result in destitution:
but they cope with great good humour and the visit was clearly a
red-letter day.
In stark contrast, Mr Hurd took the helicopter back to Dhaka to open
the new British Council offices. It was as if he had come from the
Middle Ages to a world of computers, books, and air conditioning. The
council helps some 800 Bangladeshis who have won scholarships to Britain
to train their English language skills.
Since the country won independence nearly 25 years ago, Britain has
provided #700m in aid, of which #55m was spent in 1993. Bangladesh is
the second largest recipient of British aid.
Mr Hurd said he had been impressed by the country's economic progress.
''It contradicts to a considerable extent the image Bangladesh still has
abroad,'' he said.
''On my visit to the villages in the north-west, I found a sense of
community and progress which was rather moving. I am very glad we have
such a large British aid programme. I am not talking of emergency aid,
although that will be necessary from time to time, but the kind which
can help people make the best of their lives.''
However he had a warning for his hosts. Bangladesh is in the throes of
political crisis. The three opposition parties have resigned from
Parliament in a bid to force the resignation of Prime Minister Khalida
Zia and an early General Election. A stalemate exists which could lead
to civil unrest.
''It is not for a visitor from Britain to say what the solution will
be,'' Mr Hurd said. ''We are committed to supporting the government of a
parliamentary democracy, but as friends of Bangladesh, we hope very much
that an agreement can be reached to end the political difficulties so
that progress, including the safeguarding of democracy, can proceed.''
His advice was clear, if diplomatically put. The squabbling
politically elite must put their house in order if the advances the
country has so painfully made are not to be lost.
If Parbatipur, Hooglapara, and Gobindapur seem a world away from
Dhaka, they seem even further from Coatbridge. However that is where two
of the ODA officials, Neil MacPherson and Joe Reid, went to school, as
did one of Mr Hurd's detectives, Gerry Mannion. They discovered this
fact on a dusty track outside Gobindapur. The old boys' network of St
Patrick's High School is almost as extensive as that of Eton within the
Foreign Service.

THE 12-year tale of Ronnie Knight at times bore all the hallmarks of a
Carry On farce starring his ex-wife actress Barbara Windsor. It came to
an end yesterday in the sombre surroundings of Court 16 at the Old
Bailey. JAMES McKILLOP reports.
RONNIE Knight, the fugitive who fled British justice to enjoy life in
the sun on the Costa Del Sol only to return last year in champagne style
courtesy of the tabloid press, was jailed for seven years yesterday for
his role in the 1983 Security Express robbery.
The criminal who fled to the area of Spain dubbed the Costa del Crime
admitted handling #314,813 from the #6m proceeds of the raid. At the
time it was the biggest cash robbery in the country but has since been
overtaken by the #25m gold bullion Brinks Mat raid at Heathrow.
Knight's plea of not guilty to taking part in the robbery was accepted
by the court and will remain on file.
Two of his brothers had previously been sentenced for their part in
the robbery -- one was given a 22-year sentence.
Knight had fled to Spain on the arrest of his brother, John. There he
remained, immune from extradition, until May last year when he
voluntarily returned to this country and surrendered to police.
He arrived at Luton airport in a Lear jet from Granada, hired by
Rupert Murdoch's Sun newspaper and Sky television. He had drunk
champagne all the way.
According to counsel, and police who had been hunting him, he had by
this stage also run out of money -- apart from a share in a villa
purchased before the robbery took place. His second wife was neither
offering him support or succour, the court was told.
Yesterday an Old Bailey judge heard that Knight had used the
accountant of his former wife, Barbara Windsor, to spirit proceeds from
the raid out of the country.
However, the prosecution was at pains to emphasise that the actress,
who now appears in the television soap Eastenders, had no knowledge of
what was going on. At relevant times she was appearing in a Scarborough
theatre.
Knight, 60, immaculate in grey double-breasted suit, remained
unemotional throughout the proceedings. His sun tan had long since been
replaced by prison pallor.
Defence counsel Mr Richard Ferguson, QC, said that Knight was far from
the swashbuckling figure basking in the sun as had been portrayed by the
tabloids.
He had, he said, aged dramatically since his return to the United
Kingdom and was prepared for a prison sentence at a time most people of
his age would be looking forward to an old age pension.
Knight's marriage to Barbara Windsor broke up soon after he fled the
country. In Spain he married his girlfriend, Susan Haylock, herself now
a fugitive from British justice after allegedly siphoning money from the
robbery out of the country.
Knight had ''benefited by an enormous amount of money and not one
penny of it has been recovered,'' said Judge Gerald Gordon. Although not
actually a robber himself, Knight had been ''very deeply involved''.
The judge did not make any compensation order against Knight after
hearing he had no money left but said it was open to Security Express to
take civil proceedings.
More than once during his voluntary exile Knight had said he was
prepared to come back and face questioning to clear his name. He did not
get round to it until last year.
Until his plea yesterday, he had always maintained he was innocent of
all charges and claimed to be shocked when two of his brothers and
others were jailed in 1985 for their part in the robbery and its
aftermath.
Mr Michael Worsley, QC, prosecuting, said that after consultation ''at
a very high level'' with the Crown Prosecution Service it was decided
that the plea should be accepted. The charge of robbery was ordered to
remain on the file.
The raid was ''ruthlessly'' executed on the security depot in Curtain
Road, Shoreditch, East London, over the 1983 Easter weekend, he said. A
guard was threatened with being turned into a human torch unless he told
the robbers where to find keys to the vault.
After he fled to Spain, Ronnie Knight telephoned Barbara Windsor and
told her where he was. She asked: ''What on earth are you doing in Spain
-- or words to that effect,'' counsel said. Knight had replied: ''The
Old Bill just arrested my brother John and they are after me.''
Ms Windsor, who is appearing in pantomime in Basingstoke, Hampshire,
declined to comment on events at the Old Bailey.

Grozny, Wednesday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin, under pressure at home and abroad, ordered
Russia's air force to stop bombing the shattered Chechen capital Grozny
from midnight tonight to prevent further civilian deaths.
Yeltsin's press service said he made the decision after talks with
Government leaders and took account of appeals from ordinary people and
MPs who have protested against the bloodshed in breakaway Chechnya.
The decision was taken ''on the basis of the materials the president
has received . . . and guided by the desire to prevent an increase in
the number of victims among the civilian population'', the press service
said.
It did not mention halting other use of force in Chechnya, where
Russia has thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks.
Fighters loyal to rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev have so far defied all
attempts to seize Grozny. They fought off another attack this morning in
which they said bombs hit the centre and northern outskirts of Grozny.
Despite the renewed bombing today, rebels remained in control of the
shattered city centre. Chechen fighters moved freely, heading for new
defensive positions or searching burnt-out Russian APCs for weapons or
valuables.
Yeltsin's decision to stop the bombing reflected widespread discontent
in Russia and growing concern abroad over his dispatch of troops into
Chechnya on December 11 to crush the tiny southern region's bid for
independence.
France urged fellow European Union countries to demand that Yeltsin
account for his actions. Germany accused Russia yesterday of violating
human rights by using excessive force.
In Vienna, an official at the Organisation of Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said the body's permanent council would
meet on Monday to discuss how to help stop the fighting.
''We have a right to demand explanations at the OCSE. I have contacted
our 14 partners of the European Union so that we turn to Russia and ask
Russia to give an explanation,'' said French Foreign Minister Alain
Juppe in Paris.
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani warned Russia that the
conflict would mar its ties with Muslim countries and ''fan the flames
of hatred and vengeance''.
A Russian Foreign Ministry official, Nikolai Spasski, hit back, saying
the situation in Chechnya was an internal problem and not a subject for
talks with other countries.
Air raids, which have caused many civilian casualties in Grozny, have
aroused the fiercest criticism. They have continued despite Yeltsin's
December 27 pledge to halt them.
The raids have prompted fears that Yeltsin is struggling to assert his
authority and that Russia's reforms are in danger.
''It is not only the fate of Chechnya alone, but the fate of all
Russia which is being decided in Grozny,'' Russian human rights
commissioner Sergei Kovalyov told reporters.
Hundreds of people are feared dead since Russia stepped up the
fighting on Saturday by launching a tank-led assault on Grozny. Much of
the city's population of 400,000 has fled and many buildings have been
destroyed.
Russia today flew reinforcements to regions bordering Chechnya. Sergei
Yushenkov, head of a parliamentary defence committee, quoted Ingushi
vice-president Boris Agapov as saying Russia was building up paratroop
units.
''A new storming of Grozny is expected on January 5 to 6,'' he quoted
Agapov as saying. Ingushetia has expressed sympathy with Chechnya's
struggle against Moscow.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Yegorov, in charge of
co-ordinating operations against Chechnya, said Grozny would fall
tomorrow and Russia would install a temporary administration.
Attacks on Yeltsin had increased today before he announced the halt to
bombing. Leading liberal MP Grigory Yavlinsky urged him to quit.
''For us, it has become clear that now neither Boris Yeltsin nor his
Ministers in uniform can regulate the conflict in Chechnya. There is
only one way out -- in the name of the future of our country, he should
resign,'' he said.
Two military leaders criticised the Chechnya operation. Deputy Defence
Minister Boris Gromov and General Alexander Lebed, who have attacked the
Chechnya campaign, said the crisis should be solved by talks and not
force.--Reuter.

ONE thousand police officers were on stand-by early today around the
harbour which has been the scene of two nights of violence by animal
rights protesters.
Sussex officers were joined by police from London, Hampshire and Kent
at Shoreham Harbour in West Sussex in an attempt to prevent further
disturbances.
On the past two nights, lorries loaded with sheep and calves have been
forced to turn away by hundreds of protesters opposed to live animal
exports.
They leapt on to trucks, smashing lights and hurling stones through
windscreens.
Demonstrators, including children, threw themselves in front of
lorries to stop the animals being loaded on to a ferry to France.
Port chief Philip Lacey said Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave
should either give the port proper backing or introduce a ban on live
exports.
''The police are doing everything they can and they need support now
from the highest possible level,'' he said.
The Farmers' Union of Wales had demanded tougher police protection for
the consignment of livestock, due at the harbour early today, after
sending a dossier on the damage to Home Secretary Michael Howard.
Two lorries were extensively damaged and drivers were too scared to
get out of their cabs.
''Drivers saw rods deliberately thrust into the sides of lorries and
some sheep were injured,'' said FUW official Gwilym Thomas. ''We believe
it was an attempt to bloody the sheep for publicity.''
The animal welfare group Compassion in World Farming said it was
appalled by the violence and would not put members of its staff at risk
again.

Since his goose-pimple-inducing humour
first hit the press 14 years ago, he has
been a syndication sensation. But now
the shy American cartoonist is drying his
scratchy pen. Stephen McGinty reports:
IF American cartoonist Gary Larson could have picked his guard of
honour, after he completed his final sketch from The Far Side, it would
have included cows in horn-rimmed spectacles. And joining the
short-sighted Jerseys, in standing tribute to 14 years of deranged
designs, would be crew-cutted nerds and idiots, scientists in gleaming
lab-coats, chickens in ten-gallon hats and enough fleas and insects to
lift up a laboratory.
After proceeding through the guard, he would be stood on by a pair of
just-married elephants, providing his own last laugh.
Despite the use of the past tense, Larson isn't dead -- though he
might as well be. His final Far Side cartoon appeared on Sunday, exactly
14 years after the first bizarre sketch struck an instant high note in
the San Franciso Chronicle. In the years between Larson became a
syndicated sensation.
Until this week The Far Side appeared daily in more than 1,900
newspapers and publications around the world and the laughs rubbed off
on to T-shirts, posters, mugs and calendars. But the joke was wearing
thin for the comedian. Larson took a 14-month break in 1990 and then
announced his retirement in October last year.
He said he was retiring ''out of a fear that if I continue for many
more years my work will begin to suffer or at least ease into the
graveyard of mediocre cartoons''. Up to now, Larson's look at the world
has been anything but mediocre. In his one-panel wit he has used a
collection of talking animals to mirror and mock the antics of humans,
and regularly punctured received wisdom with a tickling stick.
Classics include his contribution to the scientific debate about the
extinction of dinosaurs -- in which a surly huddle of tyrannosauri
furtively pass round cigarettes.
Or a couple quietly walking down a pavement while a clown with a
custard pie waits behind the corner. The caption reads: ''When clowns go
bad.''
Or a giant child lying on a runway while a pilot sits on his/her neck,
saying: ''Let's get this baby in the air.''
Or a cow in a cloak bearing down on a middle-aged couple who are
fending her off with a steak. The caption: ''Thwarting the vampcow.''
Many people hated the surreal Larson style and were either baffled or
outraged by his strange and menacing characters who represented, for
them, the lowest form of humour. They were wrong, of course, as Larson
pointed out in a cartoon. Humour in its lowest form is amoebas playing
tig.
The Far Side's style was always stuck in the fifties -- a period when
women had beehive hairdos and horn-rimmed spectacles, men wore hats, and
little Larson was born. He grew to work in a record store where
disillusionment drove him to doodle a series of visual gags called
''Nature's Way''.
Before his career took off, he was employed by the local Humane
Society whose officers were unaware that he had run over a dog on the
way to the interview.
A shy character who rarely grants interviews, signs autographs or
appears in photographs, Larson grew up obsessed with animals. As a child
he collected frogs and salamanders and, as an adult, he kept snakes,
horned toads, a stuffed wart hog's head and a framed shark's jaw in his
small Seattle flat. He earned a degree in communication at Washington
State University, a point his confused critics find unbelievable.
The Far Side was created when Stan Arnold of the San Francisco
Chronicle saw Nature's Way. The cartoon had been dumped by a Seattle
paper after it ran next to the children's crossword and steadily
collected complaints. Arnold loved the humour but not the name, and so
retitled it. It was a success because Larson's deranged ideas created a
cartoon with bite which had been missing, outside of political cartoons,
for years.
Today his collected cartoons regularly reach the best-sellers list and
he was even hired by the US government to design a national savings
campaign. Larson greeting cards have almost replaced paper among
teenagers. What better way to say you care than a card of one
grasshopper offering another a doughnut, with the caption: ''Oh, good
heavens, no, Gladys -- not for me . . . I ate my young just an hour
ago.''
Larson has always attracted critics. The associates of Dr Jane
Goodall, the celebrated primatologist, threatened legal action over a
cartoon in which a female ape picked at her mate's back. The caption
was: ''Well, well -- another blonde hair . . . Conducting a little more
'research' with that Jane Gooddall tramp?'' But when Goodall finally saw
it, she loved it!
Scientists have often formed Larson's home support. His cartoons are
regularly stuck up in labs, and in 1989 the Committee of Evolutionary
Biology at the University of Chicago named a chewing lice after him. The
Strigiphilus Garylarsoni is now a recognised species found only in Owls.
Larson included a photograph of the parasite in his tenth anniversary
book -- The PreHistory Of The Far Side.
The cartoonist's honourable decision to rest on his now-formidable
reputation and retire is a blow to those whose daily levelling comes
from a peek into The Far Side. Publication of his collected cartoons
will continue for a couple of years by drawing from his backlog, but it
simply can't compare to the buzz of the new.
In a rare interview with the Washington Post, Larson talked about his
cartoons and his early success. He said: ''There is a certain
frightening aspect to it. In my cartoon you might suddenly reveal
something about yourself that you never thought about. Maybe this is too
much of a look inside myself . . . I have a sense of not wanting to
really give myself over to (success); a sense that it could all suddenly
turn to smoke or I'm going to hear my mother's voice in the distance
saying, 'Gaaaaary, time for school!' and there I am, 12 years old.''

BT's decision to create the Great Clyde Divide -- with two Glasgow
phone books -- prompts JOHN LINKLATER to give the company an earful
IT IS distressing that anyone should want to spoil as unrivalled a
read as the Glasgow Phone Book. It has an amazing cast of characters and
rarely gets bogged down in plot. Many are its jokes and witticisms, from
GUMMERS Andrew, BDS, Dental Surgeon, Eglinton St., to CID L, Ashtree Ct,
Old Kilpatrick, rivalling the celebrated DUCK Dr Donald, Kilmarnock, for
so long a sparkling protagonist of the Ayrshire directory. Now British
Telecom wants to rip the Glasgow book in two.
That has been the tedious boast of every exhibitionist He-man who ever
wanted to demonstrate the power of his forearms. Now the muscle-bound,
profit-larded corporation has decreed that, from next month, the Glasgow
book will have residential numbers divided into separate volumes for
north and south of the River Clyde. It is part of an insidious strategy
to force people out of the phone book and devote it exclusively to
business.
The tactic was clear with the previous division of business and
residential numbers. Glasgow was a guinea pig for that experiment, which
BT says has been a great success. Its people must be the only people,
then, who have not spent hours before making a call anguishing over
whether to seek the number of the local minister or priest in the
business or domestic sections.
Someone should do a survey on the number of self-employed, home-based
businesses sent into oblivion.
You don't have to be abnormally given to irritability to abandon the
desire to make any phone call at all when confronted by the increasingly
compartmentalised, sub-divided and apparent random arrangements of the
present generation of phone books.
But the division of a city, by imposing an arbitary line through its
community of subscribers, is not just an added complication, testing
local geographical knowledge to an unreasonable degree when even
experienced taxi drivers can look blank when you announce your address.
It is more than that. It is a highly emotive matter.
Walls have come throughout Europe. BT has erected a new set of
arbitrary barricades. The River Clyde united Glasgow. It was the central
artery that carried the life-blood of the city. Now BT will use it to
sever the corporate body of the city, and ruin the book as surely as if
Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit was republished in two parts, featuring
characters beginning A-L and Mac-Z.
The practical justification is tenuous. BT says phone books have
become too large. They cannot be posted through letter-boxes (and until
they invent the pocket book version of your local street that will
obviously remain the case). It is said that the elderly and the disabled
are unable to use bulky phone books, but the north-south solution will
enfeeble us all with its unnecessary complexity.
There is a sinister side to the strategy. As a simple commercial
gambit, we are being forced to seek the assistance of directory
enquiries at 25 pence a shot, and the enticement is transparent with the
reduction since September of the former 45 pence charge, more than amply
subsidised by the 4.6 per cent increase in rental charges (a full two
per cent above the rate of inflation) announced on Tuesday. Rip the book
up and profits are assured.
So are increased sales of directories. BT claims that Glasgow
subscribers will not suffer. When the Glasgow North and Glasgow South
directories are published next month the business section will be found
in both, and residential numbers will be divided. Any subscriber is
entitled to claim a free copy of the companion voume, plus one directory
for an adjoining area, Clyde Valley, Clyde Coast, Lomond &amp; Argyll or
Central Scotland &amp; Trossachs. However, businesses dealing regularly with
the West of Scotland will find it an expensive business to equip
themselves with the necessary directories, each selling at #7.50, #6.50
paperback.
BT is currently producing more new directories than most publishing
houses create fresh titles. The current set for the United Kingdom
comprises 124 individual directories, plus 29 for the London Residential
and London Community books. Only a city with as little sense of
self-identity as London would have submitted to such a carve-up. Now a
nationwide exercise will ravage every city in the country, with Glasgow
the first to be bi-sected in Scotland, with Edinburgh and Aberdeen under
review. Phone books are revised every 18 months. Now they will be
sub-divided every year and half.
The proliferation is already creating total fragmentation. Liverpool
has been divided into five separate directories: North and South,
Warrington, Wirral and St Helens. The St Helens directory is a
ridiculously skimpy 124 pages. Sometimes these divisions, like splitting
Blackpool and Preston, serve local identities, but more often this orgy
of sub-division seems to play into the hands of rampant English
parochialism.
The High Peak phone book in the North West sounds like a feeble
fiction. The Havering book and the Barking Area book are mildly
inhibiting. Other books just sound like firms of lawyers: Hitchin,
Stevenage &amp; Letchworth, or Bexley, Dortford &amp; Woolwich.
If you were a bibliophile and could not resist the temptation to add
the complete set of UK phone directores to your library shelves, it
would cost #1147.50, which makes it the most expensive complete works on
the market. For many businesses, particularly those in the
communications industry, this is not a luxury but a necessity.
The trouble is, as is pointed out by Mary Gallagher -- telephone
supervisor of our own switchboard at The Herald -- there is no
up-to-date directory of the directories. The phone book index was last
revised in 1991, and it is becoming increasingly impossible to guess
which exchange has gone into which new directory.
The logical progression of this confusion is to drive the phone book
into extinction. Computerisation is inevitable and, once the CD-Rom
takes over, the invitation to subscribers will be for those who still
want the traditional phone book to compile their own as a community
initiative.
They have been doing that on the island of Colonsay for the last 15
years, published as a practical and tourist initiative by the Colonsay
Hotel.
This year's edition of the Colonsay and Oronsay Telephone Directory
lists 76 numbers, not bad going from a total population of under 100. It
is the size of a pocket diary, is coloured green, and would not divide
readily into two sections, although its 26 business numbers are in the
Non-Yellow Pages. This strange appellation was adopted when British
Telecom threatened breach of copyright.
The pocket directory is clearly the phone book of the future.
Evidently, BT believes that most subscribers would be better with a
personalised directory, or a bank of pre-set buttons on a digital phone.
A great compendium is being threatened, the only book in which we all
got an equal mention, and our equal dues.

Home Secretary Michael Howard finds himself back in the dock over
prison riots and escapes, and if his skills as a barrister should fail
in his defence his experience as a political Houdini could come into
play, as Geoffrey Parkhouse reports
HERE he is again, Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, starting the new
year as he finished the last, with increasing demands for his
resignation. He has endured convicted IRA terrorists not only hiding
their Semtex explosives in jail, but also escaping from it.
That was just a searing lowlight of Howard's 1994. He also survived
revolts in the Lords, one of them led by Viscount Whitelaw, no less, on
his legislation, much amended. This year, so far, three dangerous
criminals have escaped from Parkhurst Prison, and two days of riots have
been permitted in Everthorpe jail on Humberside.
Alleged mass murderer Frederick West, some of whose victims may be
under the M8 in Glasgow even now, was allowed enough time to himself in
Winson Green prison, Birmingham, to end his life on New Year's Day. What
is to be done about his wife, charged with him?
Howard said yesterday: ''If my policies were found to be responsible
for any such event, or if I failed to implement anything I should have
implemented, then I would, of course, resign without hesitation.'' A
characteristic barrister's response by this Welsh-born QC, of whom his
Tory enemies used to say: ''Is this just another slick silk on the
make?''
Mr Howard's apparent offer of resignation is an immediate challenge to
his new Labour Shadow, Jack Straw. If Mr Straw can find a flaw in this
careful statement and find something, anything, that Mr Howard failed to
implement, the Home Secretary's scalp can be his.
It is a difficult task. Mr Howard covers his tracks assiduously. The
buck for what befalls the prison service south of the Border technically
stops on the Home Secretary's desk. But there is now a kind of
go-between buck stage and it goes under the name of the #170,000-a-year
Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service.
When things go wrong, who should be fired: Howard or Lewis? The gun is
loaded, but where to point it? It is a situation that infuriates MPs on
all sides, particularly Tories who face the wrath of their constituency
organisations who would like to believe again that they are on top of
law and order.
Veteran Liberal Democrat Alan Beith yesterday spoke for many when he
articulated this irritation: ''Whatever goes wrong, these two men at the
top appear to be unscathed. I don't think the public is going to allow
that to continue.'' Inspector of prisons, Judge Steven Tummin,
acknowledged what he called ''a crisis of confidence among prison
staff''.
If true, there is something wrong with Mr Howard's policy, and for
this he is responsible. Will the Prime Minister sack him? No. Will he
move him in an early reshuffle? No. Is he one of the Cabinet
right-wingers, famously described by Mr Major as ''bastards'' (Peter
Lilley, Michael Portillo, John Redwood)? No. Mr Howard is too clever to
pick up such derogatory labels.
He remains vital to Mr Major as a political balancing element in his
cabinet. Discovered as an ultra-able minister of state by Margaret
Thatcher, the kind she could trust to get difficult legislation through
like water privatisation, he has worked himself up the pole with
considerable effort.
He is a Eurosceptic, but not too overtly. He is of the right, but not
so to challenge Mr Major for the soul of the Conservative Party. He is
awfully careful not get himself projected as one who has the answer to
where the Tory Party goes next. Mr Major needs him and trusts him.
No Home Secretary of any party could last longer than a week if he was
obliged to resign over a prison escape, or a police villainy. Viscount
Whitelaw survived as Home Secretary under Thatcher, even after a man had
broken into the Queen's bedroom in Buckingham Palace when she, herself,
was occupying the bed.
But Whitelaw had to account to the Commons for the incident and there
was no suggestion that the buck was not on his desk. He got away with it
with his dexterity, and by letting it be known that he had offered his
resignation to Thatcher and that it had been refused.
Mr Howard has not thought it necessary so far even to contemplate
offering his resignation to Mr Major, and this is what irks people,
particularly those who envy his legalistic ability to shuffle off blame.
His public persona grates on the nerves despite the fact that in private
he is the least arrogant person you could meet.
Furthermore, he is married to the stunningly beautiful ex-model Sandra
Paul. The marital combination makes them attractive guests at any dinner
table. But . . . but . . . there is something about Michael Howard that
appears to demand that we accept his intellect and abilities rather than
his political acumen.
At the Despatch Box in the Commons, he fails to thrill. He emanates
the feeling that he only quit the legal profession to go into politics
to administrate. Vision is something to be eschewed; give him a case and
he will argue it.
For example, or, as he would say, phonetically, for exampel, in that
irritating Llanelli lilt, his 1993 speech to the Tory Party conference
in which he articulated outrageously right-wing views on law'n'order.
The conference mood was right-wing, so he tapped into it.
It was, I guess, his way of showing that he has the common touch. He
does not. His brilliance has brought him up via Cambridge University
without experience of such a common thing as the common touch. What can
an unemployed university graduate say about a man who states in a
verbatim interview in October 1989: ''There were also certainly times
when I thought that I would probably have to be content with a career at
the bar.''
He should be so lucky to have the choice at that time. This fingers
his flaw as a politician and may curtail his career ambitions for the
very top. He expects us, with his every utterance on radio or TV, or in
the Commons, to believe that his abilities and his judgment are
inviolate. The best he can tell us when things go wrong is this
(yesterday): ''I think the important thing is to find out exactly what
happened and if things did go wrong, and if people did not behave as
they should, we must find out who is responsible.''
Home Secretary, Parliament awaits your answer. Who is responsible, if
not you?

THE Lord Provost of Edinburgh has responded to an international appeal
to support the rights of the Chechen people to independence, it emerged
yesterday.
In response to a plea from the Mayor of Vilnius, Edinburgh's twin city
in Lithuania, Mr Irons wrote to the Russian ambassador in London last
month saying he was distressed by the events in Chechnya.
He asked Mr Anatoly Adamishin for confirmation that the Russian
Government recognised the rights of Chechnya to remain an independent
state: ''If you do not believe they have the right to independence,
perhaps you would be kind enough to let me know why,'' Mr Irons wrote.
In response, Mr Irons received a fact sheet from the press office of
the Russian Embassy in London which argued that Chechnya remained a
constituent subject of the Russian Federation and that the rebel rulers
had brought it to the brink of economic and political collapse.
It added that the Russian population, totalling 300,000, had been
subjected to criminal terror.
The document claimed that the Chechen republic had been converted into
a self-styled centre of terrorism which President Dudayev's regime used
for its own gain.
Mr Irons also wrote to the Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, after
the appeal from Vilnius, asking whether the UK recognised Chechnya as an
independent state.
Mr Hurd's reply, at the beginning of last month, pointed out that the
experience of the Chechen republic was not comparable to that of
Lithuania. Its incorporation into the former Soviet Union had never been
recognised by the international community.
Chechnya, in contrast, is an integral part of the Russian Federation.
A unilateral declaration of independence had never received any form of
international recognition.
At that stage, Mr Hurd claimed President Yeltsin's troops had
exercised restraint and the UK continued to support pleas for a
peaceful, negotiated settlement, achieved without further violence.
Yesterday, however, Mr Hurd, who is visiting Bangladesh, called for an
end to the fighting in Chechnya, but said the rebel republic had no
right to secede from Russia.
Mr Hurd told BBC radio that three things were needed to end the
crisis.
''First of all, that the fighting should come to an end and that there
should be the minimum of civilian casualties.
''Second, that there should be humanitarian relief because obviously a
lot of people are suffering; and the aid agencies, the International Red
Cross, should be allowed to do their job in helping.
''And thirdly, there should be a political agreement not taking
Chechnya out of Russia -- it is part of the Russian Federation -- but
enabling there to be an agreement so that inside the Russian Federation,
Russians and Chechens understand what the autonomy means.''
Mr Hurd said the European Union had already expressed its concern and
anxiety to the Russian Government, but he refused to be drawn on whether
Moscow had the right to use force.
''I don't want to add to what I have said,'' he concluded.
In Washington, Government officials and other experts feared that the
Russian crackdown on Chechnya was a serious mistake that had isolated Mr
Yeltsin, raised new fears of anarchy in his country, and could have
far-reaching implications for US policy.
Analysts were divided on whether the crisis could bring down the
weakened leader. However even normally sympathetic US officials
acknowledged concerns that Mr Yeltsin may be moving from a democratic
agenda.

THE Berlin Wall fell in a single day. The Czechs and Slovaks
negotiated an amicable settlement for mutual independence within six
months. However, something as constitutionally timid as the Labour
Party's devolution plans apparently needs two and a half years after an
election to be brought to fruition.
Given that we might still be up to two and a half years from a General
Election, this means that, on Labour's latest timetable, Scotland would
be lucky to see a parliament this side of the millennium.
Not much of an ambition for a party which has been formally committed
to devolution for more than two decades, and which some three years ago
assured the Scottish people that our parliament would be along ''in a
tick''.
Messrs Blair and Robertson will pardon me if, now that the Christmas
spirit is wearing off, I'm beginning to detect not so much a tick or a
cross -- but an old-fashioned double-cross from New Labour.
Almost three months ago, I replied to a series of questions from
George Robertson about the SNP project for Scottish independence within
Europe. Not unreasonably, I took the opportunity to ask him, in turn, 20
questions about the devolution proposals which Labour supposedly have
been toiling over for some six years within the Constitutional
Convention.
I've asked the same questions again several times since, but was still
no closer to receiving any answers until this week when the true nature
of Labour's timetable for devolution started to slip out.
Until now, all Labour have been prepared to say is that they intended
to legislate for devolution in the first year of a Labour government.
However, last weekend Tony Blair seemed to imply that they envisaged the
parliament being up and running within a year.
This was enough for the Sunday Mail to declare triumphantly that
''Blair firmed up Labour's pledge even further by saying that a Scottish
parliament would be a reality within a year of Labour taking power at
Westminster.''
So far so good but, before you could say ''David Blunkett'', the
Labour position started to change. By yesterday morning George Robertson
had expanded the timescale by a factor of two and a half.
This question of the timetable is only the first of the 20 that I had
asked Labour about devolution. The problems that it is causing suggest
it may be some time before they attempt an answer to the other 19.
One of those is the fairly innocent enquiry of where Labour's Scottish
spokesperson would see his own political future if an assembly were
established.
It is well known, of course, that most of Labour's big names in
Scotland wouldn't touch the assembly with a barge pole which is, in
itself, a reasonable indication of the B-League status that Labour have
mapped out for their assembly.
Until now, George Robertson has offered a resolute ''don't know'' as
his answer. In contrast, his predecessor Donald Dewar has preferred to
suggest that he would be ''too old'' for an assembly.
Hitherto, Donald's response has been thought to be rather puzzling and
-- but now that we know about the delayed timescale Labour have in mind,
perhaps we will all grow old waiting for them to deliver on their
commitments to Scotland.
Labour's convolution on devolution should lead Scotland to a firm
conclusion. No Westminster party -- not Labour and certainly not the
Tories -- can be trusted to deliver on the Scottish question.
The only circumstances in which a Westminster parliament would be
likely to yield devolution is if they were attempting to head off a move
to Scottish independence.
For the past six years, Labour have escaped with relatively little
examination of their Scottish commitments. Under constant electoral
pressure from the SNP, they have presented devolution as their
number-one priority north of the Border. Down south it was an issue that
dare not speak its name.
Now all that is changed. In his desperation to talk about anything
which will have Labour and not the Government on the defensive, the
Prime Minister has embarked on a bid of flag waving in middle England.
''Devolution is revolution'' is the Major refrain, and already the
correspondence columns of the quality English press are filling up with
the ''disgusted of Hemel Hempstead'' who think the Scots could be in
danger of stealing a march.
The point is, Labour are now under pressure on the constitution and,
as recent experience indicates, the natural reaction of the Blairite
Labour Party is to get out of the kitchen when the political heat is
turned up.
The Prime Minister's anti-Scottish, and indeed his anti-European
rhetoric, won't cut much ice in Bathgate, but it will put Labour on the
spot in Basildon.
Labour will now find the Scottish rhetoric examined and compared with
their southern agenda, the national case for a parliament which they
have been arguing north of the Border will now be contrasted with the
woolly decentralist proposition they have been venturing south of the
Border.
Something will have to give and, if it is not to be their obligations
to Scotland, the political winds from the north had better be clear,
unmistakable and sustained. Otherwise Scotland will soon join Clause 4
in the dustbin of New Labour history.

Scotland's poor are the losers as first claims are made for a slice of
the National Lottery cake. Charities have been thrown into chaos by a
decision to delay their allocations
DAVID SIEFF, chairman of the National Lottery Charities Board: ''It is
an opportunity to help the most disadvantaged, who at the moment are
difficult to reach and often missed, both by the welfare state and the
voluntary sector.'' (November 1994).
This bold statement, reminiscent of that celebrated lager ad which
promised to penetrate those parts not reached by other brews, held out a
glittering promise to the 700,000 community groups in Britain. These are
the unsung heroes of our society, the women and men, mostly unpaid, who
care for the mad, the bad, the sad, the hungry, the homeless, and those
simply too poor to have a decent life. It was a statement clearly
designed to warm the cockles of the heart of anyone comtemplating the
purchase of their first lottery ticket.
Yesterday the first claims for a slice of the lottery cake were being
made by arts, sports and heritage groups, the other three groups chosen
to benefit. Their begging bowls are big. Almost first in was the Royal
Opera House, hoping for #50m for the redevelopment of its theatre in
London's Covent Garden. Meanwhile community groups in Glasgow hoping for
a few thousand to help run creches for lone parents, hostels for the
homeless and lunch clubs for poor pensioners have been told they can't
apply until the end of the year.
Damien Killeen, director of Strathclyde Poverty Alliance, is dismayed:
''It is the poorest who put the most in and are most dependent on games
of chance like the lottery to help them face their financial problems.
The commitment to ensure that they get help from the proceeds is welcome
but it's depressing to hear that the mechanism for enabling the poorest
communities to benefit is the last to be put in place. Meanwhile, those
who are seeking support for heritage, sports and arts projects are
already being catered for.''
For many of the community groups he represents, 1995 promises to be an
extremely rough year. Lucy Pratt, policy analyst with the Scottish
Council for Voluntary Organisations, says there is already anecdotal
evidence that giving to charity, particularly can collections, has
declined since the first lottery tickets went on sale in November, even
though charities will receive only 5p from each ticket. In the Irish
Republic, giving to charity declined for five years after the start of
its lottery. In a survey almost 25% said they gave less to charities
since its introduction.
And there's a special problem in Scotland this year. Many charities
who serve the needy work alongside local authorities and model their
structures on them. Local government reorganisation will force massive
restructuring costs on them. Take One Plus, the organisation which
supports lone parents in Strathclyde, runs creches, a drama group,
training courses, confidence-building courses and the like. Director
John Findlay says: ''Our revenue comes from local authorities and the
European Social Fund. If we are going to get support from the new
unitary authorities we have to set up bases in their areas. The costs
are going to be enormous.'' So far the Scottish Office has indicated
that such charities are expected to meet these costs themselves.
Bashir Maan, chairman of Strathclyde Community Relations Council,
which is in the same position, says: ''It is disappointing that lottery
money isn't available now to help groups like ours cope with the
change.'' By the time it is available in spring 1996, some may have
perished.
Why are the charities being left behind when their needs are the most
acute? The basic problem is that the charitable sector has no
pre-existing body capable of organising the distribution of the cash,
expected to exceed #100m in the first year and rise steadily thereafter.
The arts, for better or worse, have the Arts Councils of Scotland,
England and Wales, sport has the Sports Councils and heritage has the
National Heritage Memorial Fund.
Sieff was appointed to chair the new Charities Board only last May and
the 16 board members, all part-timers, were announced last July. The
chief executive wasn't appointed until December. Sieff has indicated
that he thinks these appointments are about a year too late. ''Because
there was such a delay in making appointments, the operation of the
board and how it's going to run have not yet been decided,'' says Lucy
Pratt.
In fact, a couple of key decisions have been made: the Scottish
committee, consisting of three board members (including ex-Lothian chief
executive, Graham Bowie) will have the power to decide Scottish
applications and they will get a decent slice of the cash on offer, at
least 10%. Also, community projects for deprived people will get clear
priority over charities concerned with the heritage, arts or sport,
which could apply to the other lottery fairy-godmothers for funds. In
addition, unlike the other bodies, the Charities Board can provide
revenue as well as capital costs.
But much remains to be decided: the size of grants, the balance
between large and small charities, the vetting of applications and the
evaluation of what has been given, to name but a few. In England,
charities must register with the Charities Commissioners. In Scotland,
the only indication of charitable status is registration with the Inland
Revenue.
Ted Matthews, former director of Edinburgh Voluntary Organisations
Council, says: ''People will be creeping north to get registered through
the Inland Revenue here, when they couldn't register with the Charities
Commission.'' Rooting out bogus applications is therefore a major
preoccupation.
Also, if the board wants to reach those small local helping hands, run
from people's front rooms without paid staff, they have to work out how
to do it. Bodies like Strathclyde Poverty Alliance could help but
Killeen says nobody has contacted him. And if the Scottish committee is
to control the flow of funds to Scottish-based projects, what will be
the function of the three ''UK members'' of the board? Lastly, should
the board give 100% grants, or should the percentage be limited so that
the lottery money can be used to lever funds out of the private sector
and other grant-giving bodies?
The board is about to embark on a major consultation exercise to try
to decide some of these questions. ''They have a hell of a job to arrive
at a set of ground rules and consult as to how valid they are,'' says
Matthews. Meanwhile they have been under enormous public pressure from
cash-strapped charities and, I understand, considerable
behind-the-scenes pressure from the Home Secretary to start doling out
the cash building up in their deposit account. The Home Office initially
demanded a ''fast-track system'' for applications so that cash could
start to roll. The board refused.
Ted Matthews defends the delay: ''There are some sly characters in the
voluntary sector. There has to be a lot of thought about how to vet
applications.'' Lucy Pratt of SCVO agrees: ''We'd rather it took longer
and was done properly and fairly, rather than rushing cash perhaps into
the wrong hands.''
But it's easy to understand the frustration of someone struggling to
run a homeless shelter or a drop-in service for old people living alone
when they see the Royal Opera House and the like so far ahead of them in
the queue. One put it like this: ''It's as if the Tories had said to
some whiz kid, how can we take more money from the poor and give it to
the rich without anyone making a fuss and he'd come back a few days
later with a big smile and a piece of paper with two words on it:
National Lottery.''

Kuala Lumpur, Wednesday
BRITAIN and Malaysia agree that Malaysia should open up its booming
financial sector to foreigners but differ on the timing, Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke said today.
''We are pleased with the response from Malaysian Ministers on
liberalising the financial sector although we differed on the pace and
timing of such liberalisation,'' he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Clarke, accompanied by senior financiers from London, is on a
five-day official visit. He leaves tomorrow for Thailand and will go on
to Vietnam.
His visit to the former British colony follows one in October by Mr
Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, which broke the ice
between the two countries after Malaysia lifted a seven-month ban on
British business in state contracts.
''The differences between the both of us have ended,'' Mr Clarke said.
''Both governments are anxious to be as business-friendly as ever.''
The Chancellor said Britain wanted Malaysia to open up its financial
sector to foreign participation, particularly banking and
stockbroking.--Reuter.

The Rev Ronald Christie attacks Flower of Scotland as too martial,
strident, and arrogant for a national anthem (December 29). God isn't in
it, he adds, as if the mention of God in a song makes it above reproach.
There are some pleas to God in songs which are arrogant and
sacrilegious. Send her victorious -- over whom? There is an answer in a
later verse, ''Rebellious Scots to crush''.
And another song tells God that His duty is to make England mighty and
mightier yet. Where is the meekness that shall inherit the earth?
Flower of Scotland is about repelling an aggressor, and whether it is
''proud Edward's army'' or Nazi hordes, defence of the realm is a solemn
duty. A man of the cloth should be careful not to appear to be
descending from the pulpit to the political pit. Is he a Majorite?

I was angered to read the Rev Ronald Christie's comments on the use of
Flower of Scotland as a national anthem. He claims it is ''too martial,
too strident, and too arrogant''. The National Anthem is all this and
more. Is Mr Christie aware of the line ''Rebellious Scots to crush'' in
the popularised second verse?
I would rather sing Flower of Scotland than the first verse of a song
that reminds me of the attempted genocide of our people.

The Prime Minister has said the issue of Scottish devolution
''certainly would need a referendum'' (December 31). Why doesn't he
arrange one now?
The issues are now clear cut; the Government's Taking Stock is
completed; the details of the Opposition's proposals are being
finalised. Given his parlous majority, Mr Major is unlikely to have an
overcrowded parliamentary programme before the General Election and he
could expect Opposition support in legislating for a Scottish
referendum.
If Mr Major genuinely believes the case against devolution is so
overwhelming as to merit such phrases as ''teenage madness'', ''not
thought through'', and ''one of the most dangerous propositions ever put
before the British nation'', then surely he can have nothing to fear in
putting the choice to the Scottish people during this Parliament.

I was pleased to see that at last someone, ie Ray McCall, realises
what a good Prime Minister we have in John Major (December 28).
It's a pity he didn't also mention that John Major has got inflation
under control, is managing to maintain adult employment levels at around
90% (very good considering the present world economic climate), is
improving health service efficiency, has given us freedom of choice in
education, and is slowly switching from incentive-killing direct
taxation to VAT-based indirect taxation where the essentials of life,
with the exception of fuel, are zero rated.
As Harold Macmillan said many years ago, ''We've never had it so
good.''

December 28.
At the last UK General Election 629,552 (21.5%) voted SNP and got
three MPs, Labour polled 1,142,866 votes (39%) and elected 49 MPs. I
find it astonishing that Labour MP John Maxton can actually defend such
a fraud (December 28).
Conservative MP Phil Gallie took court action to try to prevent
Alloway village being transferred from its marginal constituency to a
neighbouring seat with a huge Labour majority. Mr Gallie was, in fact,
recognising that the Boundary Commission had effectively decided to
disenfranchise the Tory voters of Alloway for life -- their votes in
future would count for nothing.
In the outdated UK the value of a citizen's vote depends upon where
the citizen lives rather than what the citizen actually thinks.

Recently, good news broke for land speculators -- 20,000 acres of
Central Scotland is on offer in one lot from British Coal Properties
(North). The last to hear were the 50 tenant farmers on the land
concerned.
Incredibly, millionaire Cabinet Minister Michael Heseltine has
authorised a total of 150,000 acres of former coal board land across the
UK to go under the hammer to the highest bidders in the minimum of lots.
Only other millionaires need apply!
The Scottish block, though scattered over several central-belt
counties, could create one of the biggest estates by far in those parts.
Out the DTI window went Tory policies about promoting wider property
ownership.
While degraded Highland shooting estates often sell in huge blocks,
records show few, if any, estates in Central Scotland over 12,000 acres,
the exceptions being public utilities.
In 1970 the National Coal Board held 49,000 acres in Scotland. Surely
the tenants who farm the bulk of this land should have first refusal on
the disposal of such a valuable asset by its successor?
Not so, it seems, and this goes to the heart of the festering sore
which British governments refuse to tackle, namely that Scotland has the
most concentrated pattern of land ownership in Europe. A mere 1723
landowners control 63% of Scotland, according to 1970 figures, lack of
up-to-date public data being yet another scandal.
In the central belt, counties affected by the British Coal sale, a
mere 173 individuals own 43.3% of land in blocks of over 1000 acres. So
what does Heseltine do? He gives the nod to the creation of a brand-new
monster private estate.
With all the recurring ills of ''landlord-ridden'' Scotland, 50 tenant
farmers become the latest victims of remote decisions made in a
Treasury-backed scam which would gladden Michael Portillo's heart.
It is a prime interest of Scots to break the shackles of being
''tenants in our own land'', so the laws of Scotland must be made to
prevent land sales of this sort to any purchaser who has no intention of
personally working a family business therefrom.
Who believes that any British political party has the gumption?

The decision by both BBC and STV to abandon traditional musical
programmes to bring in the New Year will no doubt please some and
disappoint many.
In the current relentless search for ratings, people and traditions
are savagely sacrificed to be replaced by dreary, doleful pop groups
who'd neither inspire nor contribute much more than a passing fashion
whim to our culture.
Perhaps those who make such major decisions would ponder two points.
First, there are thousands of young Scots who study hard all year to
acquire skills in singing, dancing, and music, many becoming fine
musicians. Such application ensures a steady flow of talent to our
society, and will no doubt be perpetuated by successive generations.
Such skills ought to be encouraged by the broadcasting moguls, not
ignored.
Secondly, the BBC is particularly guilty in both radio and television
programming of being powered by rampant feminism and blatant ageism,
forgetting that its funding comes from a public, old as well as young,
and this ought to be better reflected in its output.
Surely it is not too much to expect our broadcasters, and their
watchdog quangos, to maintain a bit of tradition, and not abandon it.

I was fascinated by the article explaining the careful thinking behind
the enormously successful Glasgow's Miles Better campaign (December 30).
It is seldom that an organisation, especially a public one, targets
its objectives so effectively. Accordingly I share Dr Kelly's
reservations about complacency and repeating the old campaign now that
the original aims have been satisfied.
We can surely advance on past achievements. With prejudices
justifiably softened over any adverse image, I think there are currently
excellent chances available for Scotland to prosper, for example, by
becoming a key European financial centre alongside Frankfurt and London.
Public facilities funded from private wealth would surely follow the
economic improvement.
Self-confidence is so very important.

How refreshing it was to read Bob Crampsey's sympathetic and balanced
article on the sad state of English cricket as demonstrated by the
humiliation suffered in the Second Test at Melbourne (December 30).
His criticism was constructive and his advice sound and it was without
the sadistic satisfaction and gleeful gloating indulged in by so many of
our fellow Scots.
I am deeply saddened by the Anglophobic sentiments of those who
delight in the troubles of our test team.
I feel sure the thousands of cricket enthusiasts north of the Border
share my feelings and are every bit as concerned about what is happening
in Australia as any lover of the game in England.
For the generation of Scots who were schoolboys in the years
immediately after the Second World War, (Sir) Len Hutton, Cyril
Washbrook, Denis Compton, Jim Laker, and Alec Bedser were cricketing
heroes. The fact that they were English was never considered and made
not the slightest difference to our admiration for them.
I look forward to changes which will bring about a much needed revival
in England's (Britain's) cricketing fortunes. The talent is there, if
properly nurtured, and some of it could well be in Scotland.

OF all the newspapers in all the world the one that has come into my
ken called itself The Dollar Dumpling. How is it that all the hotter
stories end up here?
Dumpling is a suety sort of name for a paper. It sounds more like a
secondary title that weary readers might attach to their regular read.
Publishers prefer something swift and far-seeing for a banner. Sentinel,
say, or Argus would be more like it. Dollar could have achieved the
alliteration it seemed to crave with Dispatch. Yet it plumped for
Dumpling.
It seemed like fun, if not a lot of it, to find out why.
How the Dumpling landed on my plate was from NEWSPLAN, a scholarly
list of old newspapers held in Scottish libraries and hailed in last
Thursday's sermon. Lo, between an entry for (eh?) A Diurnall of Some
Passages and Affairs (dated 1652) and Forfar's Donside Piper and Herald
lay the paper called a pudding.
According to the library survey, the only copy of it in all the world
is to be found in the Central Library of Dunfermline.
Here and there the pages have been carefully patched. They could have
been kept smooth by ironing. Certainly they do not show the wear and
tear of having been on the street since 1893.
Otherwise it could be any old rag. Local news, sport, and business
bits are all there. Advertisements fill the front page. There are some
stray paragraphs of foreign tidings. There is gossip. Oddly, a leer of
sex lurks between some lines.
Such shining sixpences of intelligence are crammed into the very first
issue of the Dumpling. Its last edition is much the same. In fact the
ingredients stayed consistent all the way through. For The Dollar
Dumpling died with the going down of the sun on the day it was born.
What survives from it includes probably the crankiest and most candid
editorial in the history of newspapers.
Like posher and more pretentious journals, the Dumpling kicks off with
a prospectus. But instead of promising plain speaking and high thinking
this paper brags about all the important stuff its columns will fail to
contain. ''We have no intention (the editor intones) of discussing Home
Rule, Female Franchise, the Domestic Policy of the Japanese, or the
correct size of beer mats.''
So what does that leave?
We exist for one object (thunders the editorial) and ONE ONLY.
It is to make money and that as largely and as quickly as is possible.
We shall therefore make it our constant endeavour to give the least
possible value for the highest price . . .
Such apparent bright truthfulness disguised the devious purpose of the
Dumpling. Its only aim was to advertise a grand bazaar and fancy fair in
Dollar's Institute Hall. Its four crammed pages contain no other actual
fact or hard piece of information. The newspaper that NEWSPLAN solemnly
seeks to have preserved as part of the national heritage was not a
newspaper at all.
What it and the bazaar were about was raising the readies for a new
clubhouse and green for Dollar bowlers.
To this end the Dumpling made mince of everybody and anything, even
cricket.
On its back page it purports to report a match between a Dollar second
XI and an All-England squad of 22 players. A high point of the encounter
(won by guess who?) came when Slasher, a local ace batsman, struck the
ball so far that the long-leg fielder on the Saxon side had to take the
first train to Alloa to recover it.
Also included in the paper's less than chaste pages is a cod
advertisement for a Victorian escort agency that supplied ''bosom
friends to well-to-do bachelors and widowers''. As for its really sexy
items, this new year is too young for them to be related here.
However regrettable was the Dumpling's disregard for truth and beauty,
it delivered what it said it would. Although at tuppence a time it died
after one issue, yet it still lives.
Mack White, secretary of Dollar Bowling Club, yesterday confirmed that
the clubhouse, since much extended and improved, that the non-newspaper
helped to build remains in use.
To begin with, as the club's minute-book records, it was a wooden hut
with a tin roof, an open verandah, and a Gents privy that, like the
balcony, was an outside feature. Serious journalism has few monuments so
noble.
(Incidently, the NEWSPLAN library survey also lists a publication
called the -- eh? -- Aberdeen New Shaver. In recycled old papers could
lie a whole new column career of sorts.)

THE prospect of a potentially violent confrontation between Ayr Road
Route protesters and Wimpey, the firm which will build the #53.6m
motorway project, receded yesterday.
The company announced it was unlikely that any of its staff would
visit the Glasgow site on Monday, the project's nominal start date.
Mr Iain McConnell, the firm's director of corporate relations, said
Wimpey still was finalising details of the motorway extension's design
and were hoping for further meetings with protesters and community
groups over the final blueprint for the 11km road, which will link the
M77 at Dumbreck to the A77 at Malletsheugh.
Possible alterations could involve landscaping work in addition to the
proposed planting of 165,000 trees, minor changes to the road's
direction and the provision of additional children's playing facilities
to replace those affected by the motorway extension, which is expected
to take two years to complete.
Earth First! activists, who have established a fortified encampment in
the road's path in Pollok Estate, yesterday called a press conference to
unveil their preparations for stopping the building work.
Mr Robert Hutton, a spokesman for the direct action environmental
group, said it would continue with plans to mass ''hundreds of
activists'' at the site regardless of the predicted absence of Wimpey
personnel.

January 3.
The Herald is to be commended for providing a verbatim report of the
devolution section of the Prime Minister's recent interview. It alone of
at least five quality newspapers did so (December 31).
While ''correspondent reports'' with selective quotations are no doubt
a practical necessity for most news coverage, verbatim reports serve a
particular use in clarifying items of significant political relevance.
For example, following his promotion to leader of the Labour Party, Mr
Blair gave his commitment to legislate on devolution within the first
year of a Labour government.
The absence of a commitment to convert this legislation subsequently
into an actual Scottish parliament caused some to doubt his intentions,
but others assumed a parliament to be implicit in his commitment.
The BBC Scotland radio news (December 31) went further and assumed it
meant ''to establish a Scottish parliament within a year of taking
office''.
Pre-election policy commitments may not mean much in post-election
terms but they form a necessary basis for electoral assessments. It
seems extraordinary that three interpretations of Mr Blair's commitment
appear to coexist.
Greater newspaper use of verbatim reporting might in this case have
reduced these to a single interpretation and also avoided the suspicion
of deliberate Labour obfuscation.

HOUSE prices rose by less than a percentage point last year and may do
something nearly similar this year, according to the findings of the
largest building societies. That looks like good news for first-time
buyers, but existing owner-occupiers may not be best pleased: we are now
into the fifth year in which house prices generally have either fallen
or, more or less, stood still. Since the housing market is the main
place for British savings, its stagnation is not a matter of academic
interest only. It is, for example, one of the main reasons for many
people not enjoying the feel-good factor thought to be essential to any
recovery in the Government's political fortunes. It is not only that for
many their main asset has had its value frozen for a few years but the
actual market is very slow to move (although there is considerable
variation between places, and Scotland generally has had a much happier
experience than England).
If we are in a genuinely low-inflation economy, house prices will not
soar the way they used to even when the market has come more into
balance between sellers and buyers. One reason for the near price
standstill was the way in which inflationary expectations led to many
huge premiums for houses bought in the late 1980s. These expectations
have been dashed, and the victims have been paying for it. At least they
have had the advantage of nearly three years of low interest rates in
which they ought to have been able to reduce their outstanding capital
balances somewhat. That advantage is now in the process of being
reversed, with analysts disagreeing only on the timing of the next
increase. These movements are actually making home ownership expensive,
with mortgage payments being dear in real terms. Even without that
change, the cost of mortgages will effectively rise from April as the
Chancellor's relentless reduction of mortgage tax relief comes into
effect. Messrs Lamont and Clarke between them have almost eliminated the
privilege conferred on house buyers by Mr Roy Jenkins in 1969 when he
ended tax relief on all borrowing other than mortgages.
Of course it will all right itself in time. House prices are bound to
rise a bit more than has been the rule these past few years because even
low inflation affects the cost of new building which in turn has a
knock-on effect for most of the housing stock which is second-hand. That
effect may be mitigated by the impact of demographic change which will
affect demand for all housing, though hardly for better housing. An
ageing population may need fewer houses (it could just as easily want
many more ''second'' houses) but will want them to be better. Many will
still trade up, at least making for a more liquid market, if not for one
where prices roar ahead as they did in the three main inflationary
upsurges since 1945. The only caveat to all this remains the success of
the Government's anti-inflationary strategy. If it is abandoned by this,
or a different, administration house prices will soar again and suck
scarce investment back into bricks and mortar. That would not be
socially desirable, though it might be very popular.

AFTER three years it looks as if the Government has decided to call it
a day and will suspend the attempt to investigate those suspected of
crimes against humanity during the Second World War. The effort cost #5m
and funds will be exhausted by the end of the financial year. The work
involved has yielded no prosecutions. Those who protested against the
whole notion of investigation and eventual prosecution, encapsulated in
the 1990 War Crimes Act, will feel vindicated, although it is thought
that possibly three cases might have come to trial, and indeed these may
still be pursued. Many who supported the original effort will feel
frustrated: some have already expressed the view that the UK will seem
like a safe haven for such criminals, which is, in effect, what it was
before 1990.
The money spent was not wasted. The crimes involved, mostly against
Jews and others murdered in huge numbers in special extermination camps,
were of such enormity that every effort had to be made to bring the
surviving killers to justice. Apart from anything else the
investigations, no matter how late in the day, would have sent a signal
to more contemporary criminals that their atrocious behaviour would not
be ignored in times of peace. It would have seemed too cynical to have
ignored the call for justice even though it meant introducing
retrospective legislation.
It is the passage of time which, more than anything, has prevented the
investigations being successful. Prosecutions demanded the collection
and assessment of documentary evidence, often from central and eastern
Europe, where its own survival has been arbitrary as different regimes
have succeeded each other and had different attitudes to archival
remains. In addition, the direct, and vital, testimony of eye witnesses
has often been lacking. The fact is that witnesses are now old: it is
half a century since the end of the war in Europe. Since many of the
Nazi victims were children, some survivors would not be too old to
remember those responsible for their suffering, but the certainty of
identification would not have existed, as the Israelis found in the
Demaniuk case. Time massively changes a man's appearance as well as
playing tricks of memory on us all. The fit of documentary evidence and
individual memory (in the absence of confession) had to be precise to
meet the needs of such horrendous happenings, such horrendous
accusations. That precision has simply not been capable of achievement.
For these reasons the decision not to pursue matters further is
understandable. It alters nothing about the nature of the crimes or the
evil of those responsible for them, but merely confirms the facts of
ageing and mortality.

SO, it's only five days into 1995 and your New Year resolve is fraying
at the edges. Let Tommy Graham, MP, be your inspiration.
The portly Labour MP for various bits of Renfrewshire is four stones
less portly than he was six months ago. Tommy's road to Damascus,
weight-wise, came last summer when he was on holiday in the Highlands.
He was peching and wheezing on the slightest incline and was getting
thoroughly fed-up being overtaken by old age pensioners.
A diet of fruit and vitamin drinks and willpower saw him shed the four
stones. Over the festive season he managed to limit his weight increase
to 5lbs.
Mr Graham sensibly refuses to reveal what he weighed at his peak. His
target is to lose another four stones by next Christmas, when he hopes
Santa will bring him a bicycle and he can begin some serious exercise.
* MR GRAHAM was recently visiting some of his Linwood constituents
whose homes had been flooded. One lady by the name of Lily related that
she had been rescued by some nice polis in a rowing boat. ''I'd been to
the fortune-teller two weeks before and she told me I would be going on
a boat trip,'' Lily told him. ''But she never said the trip would be up
my own street.''
Arthur's seat
STILL on the subject of New Year resolutions, we hear of a Hogmanay
incident in a front room in downtown Giffnock. A new arrival is
introduced as ''Arthur from across the road''.
At this point a chap who had been sitting quietly imbibing, leaps to
his feet and confronts the newcomer: ''So you're Arthur. Just when I'm
settling down with my Herald I'm told Arthur's decorating the lounge, or
Arthur's painting the garage, or Arthur's digging the garden.
''Arthur's always doing something. Arthur, I've got a New Year
resolution for you. Just sit on your backside of an evening and give the
rest of us the chance to do the same.''
Outbreak of red tape
AS the NHS continues to make its way to hell on a handcart, one of the
great obsessions of the new trust hospitals is something called quality
assurance.
We are in receipt of a memo from a Mr Alan MacDonald, director of
nursing and quality assurance at the Angus NHS Trust. He informs the
trust staff: ''Our intention is to move more and more towards developing
multidisciplinary clinical audits; indeed this is the expectation from
the management executive as confirmed in their recent document Guidance
on the Development of Clinical Audit.
''It is therefore most important that when a clinical audit is being
prepared by nursing, medical or professions allied to medicine that
consideration is given to other disciplines and, if appropriate, a joint
approach should be developed.
''For non-clinical audits -- eg catering contract monitoring -- a
reporting system is being developed . . .''
What all this has to do with actually making people better or, indeed,
ensuring that their bedpans are removed in a quality manner is anybody's
guess. We do know that a ward sister has been taken off her duties at
Stracathro Hospital, Brechin, to become standards and audit project
officer for the Angus unit. She will be working closely with the
in-service education manager, nursing, and with the Unit Steering Group
for Quality Assurance.
The Angus NHS TRUST quality people have even come up with their own
slogan: ''Remember -- Quality is everybodys business''. No apostrophe in
everybodys. We hope the quality of their medicine is better than the
quality of their punctuation.
Dear green place
WE fear the following may be apocryphal, but anyway there's nothing
wrong with a bit of urban mythology. The scene is Easterhouse, where the
building site of a new sports facility has been subjected to extensive
pilfering.
Shortly afterwards, during a visit to a household in the area, a
member of one of the caring professions notices that the family has been
blessed with new carpeting. Closer inspection reveals that almost the
entire floor area of the house, and a wall or two, is covered in
Astroturf. Very hard-wearing, points out the proud tenant, and an ideal
playing surface for the weans.
Gift-horse in
the mouthpiece
A READER is on about British Telecom's PremierLine service, the Haud
Me Back qualities of which she feels all of you out there should know
about. One of the PremierLine features is the Talking Point.
This is a sort of hot-air miles whereby for every #1 of chat, BT
awards one Talking Point which, when saved in sufficient quantities, can
be exchanged for valuable gifts.
Our correspondent says: ''Although we are fairly high domestic users,
we estimate it will be at least the year 2002 before we have saved
enough for a toaster, costing 2680 Talking Points. Perhaps we should set
our sights lower and aim for a set of six notelets which will take us
only a year-and-a-half to earn.''
Still, it's nice to talk.

BARBARA Windsor said last night she felt totally betrayed when she was
told that Ronnie Knight had hidden robbery proceeds in her account.
She learned only recently that hundreds of thousands of pounds had
passed through one of her accounts before Knight fled to Spain.
''I can't believe that the man I loved and spent 21 years married to
would do this to me,'' she said. ''I could have gone to jail. I feel
totally betrayed.''
Even after he fled to Spain with a new girlfriend and spent thousands
refurbishing their villa, Miss Windsor believed his new wealth came not
from the robbery, but a nightclub and restaurant venture.
She said it was last summer when police told her that her accounts had
been used.
''I told them that I was the most useless bird on God's earth when it
came to money, and that all my finances were dealt with by my
accountant. I have never even opened my bank statements.''
Over six months, #264,000 was banked with her accountants. Knight told
them it came from property deals, she said.
After Knight was sentenced to seven years, Miss Windsor said: ''He's
had a right result, hasn't he? He'll be out in a couple of years.''
The actress had previously stood by her husband at an Old Bailey
murder trial in 1980.
He was then acquitted of the murder of Alfredo ''Italian Tony''
Zomparelli, who had killed Knight's brother, David in a pub brawl.
Knight had been accused of paying a hitman #1000, but was cleared after
Ms Windsor had given evidence.

AN oil tanker was allowed to drift away from her station early
yesterday after her power failed.
The Norissia, operated by Shell Expro, encountered problems while
loading oil from a buoy 100 miles east of Aberdeen. The buoy is a moored
floating structure which sits more than a mile away from the Kittiwake
platform.
Power is required to keep a tanker on station. Because wind and tide
would take the vessel away from the platform, a decision was taken
detach her from the buoy to prevent any damage.
A line was attached to a support vessel until her power was restored
an hour later. A Shell Expro spokesman said an investigation was under
way.
The company also indicated that production would restart this weekend
from the Brent Alpha platform after storm damage to its pipeline on
January 1.

Industrial Correspondent ROY ROGERS reports from the British
Psychological Society's conference at Warwick University
EQUAL opportunities legislation and the emergence of the so-called
''new man'' have done little to reduce sex discrimination in employment,
it was claimed yesterday.
Dr Tuvia Melamed, of the University of Central Lancashire, told the
British Psychological Society's occupational psychology conference at
Warwick University that his research showed that on average women still
received only 75% of male pay rates.
A representative sample of almost 500 men and women managers across a
variety of industries produced an average salary of #18,000 for men and
#13,500 for women.
Try as he might to explain the continuing differential, including
personality characteristics, human attributes, career choices and labour
market economic forces, he concluded that more than 25% of the gender
gap in career success was attibuted to sex discrimination.
Equal oportunities legislation had no teeth and was seen as a
''politically correct facade.'' The ''new man'' image he saw as a myth.
He suggested that perhaps maternity and paternity leave entitlements
should be equalised to allow either parent to spend the first three
months at home with a new infant, as was the case in his native Israel.
He added, however, that a mere handful of men out of a 1.5m Israeli
workforce had availed themselves of that opportunity.
He also produced evidence suggesting that the very factors that speed
a man's career could actually hinder a woman's.
Men were more likely to be successful if extrovert and
''independent-dominant'' and their marriage and parenthood served as
signals of responsibility and stability. The reverse was more likely to
be the case for women.
His advice was for women to concentrate more on eduction and training
and for men to brush up their golfing skills in order to improve their
standing with their boss.
A separate study demonstrated the efforts being made by police forces
to recruit and promote more women officers with little apparent success.
Authors Penny Dick, of Teesside Business School, and Rashmi Biswas, of
Sheffield Hallam University, reported a ''massive positive response''
from forces keen to research equal opportunities.
They found that male-dominated departments such as CID and
female-dominated ones such as Family Protection Units, tended to be
stereotypes that discouraged females from applying to male-dominated
areas and vice versa.
In addition, female officers tended to develop male-like
characteristics of putting the job before everything else, including
families.
One force had an 11% proportion of female officers although these were
predominantly constables and none held a rank above superintendent.

FOLDING rear seats in most cars are not strong enough to hold back
luggage in a crash, says a Consumers' Association report today.
The Government should force car manufacturers to strengthen the design
of rear seat backs, adds the report in Which? magazine.
Drivers would be wise to keep rear seat belts fastened to help contain
luggage even when there are no back seat passengers, the report says.
Heavy luggage should be tied down if possible.
''It is all too easy for the luggage to break through and injure
passengers or crush them between the seat belt and the broken seat
back,'' said Which? researcher James Roberts.
''Motor manufacturers must change their designs so all passengers are
adequately protected. Rear seats needn't pose a danger, but because of
inadequate standards passengers are still being put at risk.''
Which? says even rear seats in new cars are not good enough.
Researchers found that the back seats in the Rover 416 estate could
release in a crash, needlessly putting passengers at risk, adds the
report.

* Even Socks, President Clinton's family cat, is not safe from the

Representative Dan Burton of Indiana attacked the cat's fan-mail

PUB violence is on the increase with participants using any available
weapon from pork pies to pool cues.
Brewers are now taking a more serious look at the causes of violence
and how it might be eradicated, Phil Leather and Rosie Dickson of
Nottingham University told delegates.
In the past publicans tended not to reveal the extent of violence on
their premises for fear of attracting the displeasure of the breweries,
the police and licensing authorities and scaring off custom.
Breweries are now becoming far more aware of the problem and
supportive of their managers with psychologists being brought in to
help.
Improved training for managers and greater availability of back-up
staff together with further investigation of pub layout and decor were
seen as the way forward.

A FRIENDLY football match ended with a convicted killer butting an
opponent in the face.
Norman Lawson, 35, fouled a player on the other team then butted him
when he got up, knocking him down again.
Lawson's victim had two chipped teeth, a cut inside his mouth, and a
bleeding nose.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday Sheriff Gordon Shiach advised
Lawson, of Alan Breck Gardens, Clermiston, Edinburgh, to get a solicitor
to represent him.
He had noticed that Lawson's last previous conviction was at the High
Court in March 23, 1988, for culpable homicide, although he was
admonished by the judge.
Lawson admitted assaulting Neil Hardie at Saughton Park, Edinburgh, on
last July by butting him on the face in a match between Gyle Centre
staff and Safeway shop staff.
Sheriff Shiach said it was ''a fairly serious assault on the football
ground''. He deferred sentence for reports until January 25 and released
Lawson on bail.

A MAN appeared in court yesterday accused of killing a friend by
dangerous driving.
Mr John Friel, 25, died and his 19-year-old girlfriend, Ms Michelle
O'Neill, was seriously injured in a crash near their home in Clydebank
in the early hours of Monday.
It is alleged at Dumbarton Sheriff Court they were travelling in a car
said to have been driven by Mr Robert Lamont, 24.
The court heard the vehicle went out of control, bounced off a
pedestrian barrier and ploughed into a lamppost in Glasgow Road,
Clydebank.
Mr Lamont, of Plean Street, Scotstoun, Glasgow, faced nine charges.
These included stealing the car, causing the death of Mr Friel by
driving carelessly and at excessive speed, driving while disqualified,
refusing to provide a specimen of breath, refusing to provide a specimen
of blood, and three breaches of bail.
Mr Friel's solicitor, Mr Liam Robertson, made no plea or declaration
and the accused was remanded in custody for further inquiry.

<TEXT>
GAMBLER Donald Brown did not have much luck when it came to bank
robbery, a court heard yesterday.
In fact, when gambling, he did not have much luck either.
Brown spent #7500 compensation which he was awarded for an industrial
injury to his knee, then fell into the clutches of loan sharks, the High
Court in Glasgow was told.
He borrowed #500 which soon became a debt of #6000, and as well as
beating him up several times, the loan sharks took his television, video
and golf clubs.
Reduced to selling golf balls which he found on his local course,
Brown, a 37-year-old bachelor, decided robbery was the answer to his
problems.
His defence counsel, Mr John Morris, told the court that at first
Brown thought of robbing his local bookie, which to some degree had
brought about his downfall. But because he liked the staff he decided to
rob a bank.
Armed with an air pistol, he held up staff in a Paisley bank, dropping
the gun in the process.
Unknown to him, in the haul of cash was a concealed dye pack timed to
explode outside the bank.
When it erupted in a cloud of smoke, Brown dropped the money in panic
and fled covered in red dye.
Brown yesterday admitted robbing staff at the Bank of Scotland in
Causeyside Street, Paisley, of #3190 on May 5 last year.
Mr Morris told the court, however, that Brown's misfortunes didn't end
there.
The court heard that for five months the accused had lived in fear of
police calling at his home in Johnston Place, Paisley, because during
fits of remorse he had told a number of people about the raid.
Mr Morris said that Brown felt ''immense relief'' when police
eventually arrested him.
He said that Brown, a ''compulsive gambler since he was in short
trousers,'' had never been in trouble before, and until suffering a knee
injury had always worked.
Earlier, Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, told the court that Brown
was arrested as a result of confidential information given to police.
He told how Brown, his face in a mask, burst into the bank, told staff
to get down, threatened to fire shots through the bandit screen, and
ordered one of them to fill up a bag with money.
He ran from the bank pursued by two staff, and after the hidden dye
bomb went off, dropped the money.
Jailing him for five years, Lord Allanbridge told Brown that he was
limiting the sentence in view of the special circumstances of his case.

Washington, Wednesday
THE Republicans took over Congress today and immediately set to work
to reform its institutional habits and to launch their ''Contract with
America''. Newt Gingrich, the combative party leader from Georgia, was
elected Speaker of the House by 228 to 202.
He delivered a notably moderate speech to the new house. ''I know I'm
a partisan figure, but I hope we can have a real dialogue.''
What Democrats consider the real Gingrich was also on show.
A television interview with his mother, to be broadcast tomorrow,
revealed that he had described Hillary Clinton as a bitch. Mr Gingrich
denounced the network for broadcasting his mother's revelation; he did
not apologise for making the comment.
To the defeated Democrats, it appears the barbarians have conquered
Washington.
In the Senate, the Republicans want to start by eliminating 100 or so
government programmes entirely, cutting the budget by $400bn over the
next five years.
There are about 3600 programmes, so losing 100 is not so dramatic as
it sounds, and even $400bn will still leave an annual deficit of $100bn.
The Republicans propose to balance the federal budget by 2002, and
even the proposed cuts are less that half what is needed.
On the House side, Mr Gingrich has prepared a long and detailed list
of measures, many of them introduced today even as the new members
struggle to get their phones working and move into their new offices.
The House will propose that in future Congress must abide by civil
rights laws, on such matters as discrimination in employment. Previous
efforts to get Congress to obey the laws it imposed on everyone else
have been defeated, by the Republican party.
The House will also limit the powers of committee chairmen, a reform
that will increase the power of the Speaker. It will be asked to make a
rule that taxes may be increased only on a three-fifths vote.
More substantial reforms will be introduced in the next few days,
including a balanced-budget amendment and a proposal to allow the
President a ''line-item veto'', meaning that he will be able to strike
individual items from spending bills without vetoing the whole measure.
Mr Clinton, like all his predecessors, of both parties, has long
supported the line-item veto.
The Republicans will also aim for a tax cut and an attack on
government bureaucracy.

Washington, Wednesday
THE Republicans took over Congress today and immediately set to work
to reform its institutional habits and to launch their ''Contract with
America''. Newt Gingrich, the combative party leader from Georgia, was
elected Speaker of the House by 228 to 202.
He gave the tone of the occasion, demonstrating that he intends to
continue the in-your-face aggressiveness that has led him to victory.
A television interview with his mother shows her quoting the Speaker
calling Hillary Clinton a bitch, and he has invited the right-wing radio
talk-show hosts whose stock-in-trade is slander and smear to set up in
offices near his own.
To the defeated Democrats, it appears that the barbarians have
conquered Washington. Some of them, starting with their Whip, David
Bonior, will fight fire with fire, and will echo Mr Gingrich's
confrontational style. Unless the two men suddenly change, there will be
some very nasty moments in the new Congress.
Other Democrats will hope that the Republicans will self-destruct, but
for the next few week, at least, what the Democrats think or say will
not matter much. All attention will be on the Republicans.
In the Senate, they want to start by eliminating 100 or so Government
programmes, cutting the budget by $400bn (#266bn) over five years. There
are about 3600 programmes, so losing 100 is not so dramatic as it
sounds, and even $400 billion will still leave an annual deficit of
$100bn.
The Republicans propose to balance the federal budget by 2002, but
even the proposed cuts are less than half of what is needed.
On the House side, Mr Gingrich has prepared a long list of measures,
many introduced today even as new members struggle to make their phones
work.
The House will propose that in future Congress must abide by civil
rights laws on such matters as discrimination in employment. Previous
efforts to make Congress obey the laws it imposed on everyone else have
been defeated -- by the Republican party.
The House will also limit the powers of committee chairmen, a reform
that will increase the power of the Speaker. It will be asked to make a
rule that taxes may only be increased on a three-fifths vote. No doubt
the Democrats will oppose it, unsuccessfully, but they will be able to
reverse the rule when they next win the House.
More substantial reforms will be introduced in the next few days,
including a balanced-budget amendment and a proposal to allow the
president a line-item veto, meaning that he will be able to strike
individual items from spending Bills without vetoing the whole measure.
Mr Clinton, like all his predecessors of both parties, has long
supported this.
The balanced budget amendment will no doubt pass the House by January
19, Mr Gingrich's target date, but may get stuck in the Senate.
Then the Republicans will set to work with other, more substantial
measures, including a tax cut and an attack on Government bureaucracy.

THE BBC has settled an action raised by a housing group just weeks
before the case was due to go to court.
It has apologised to Borders-based Waverley Housing over a documentary
which dealt with the sale of housing in the Borders area by Scottish
Homes.
The corporation also paid undisclosed damages to the individuals
involved in the action -- Waverley Management chairman George Burt,
general manager Robert Johnson and finance director Stephen Scott. The
legal costs of both companies and the three men were also paid by the
BBC.
In March 1992, Scottish Homes sold 1191 houses to the
tenant-controlled Waverley Housing Trust for more than #5m.
Waverley had complained that the Focal Point programme alleged
collusion between Waverley Housing Trust, Waverley Housing Management
Limited and the Scottish Office.
Yesterday the BBC said that if any inference could have been drawn
from the programme that there was a secret agreement for a fraudulent
purpose they wished to make it clear that no such inference was
intended.
The BBC also accepted that the management company and the trust had
been created in a manner designed to prevent the possibility of any
individual becoming rich, and in particular the three men named in the
programme.

<HEADLINE>Anger as gallery snubs John Knox. Artist's descendant protests over city's refusal to show work.</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE great-great-great-grand-nephew of one of Glasgow's most eminent
artists, John Knox, has accused Glasgow District Council's department of
Museums and Art Galleries of being more interested in showing exhibits
from abroad than in mounting exhibitions of Scottish work.
Mr Michael Stewart, a descendant of the Paisley-born artist, said
yesterday that he was disappointed that the city's art galleries
department had refused to mount an exhibition this year of Knox's work
to mark the 150th anniversary of his death on January 5, 1845.
''I had hoped to find greater recognition of Knox's work in the
Glasgow Art Galleries -- particularly at Kelvingrove where his brother
lived in the house that became the original art gallery.
''I have been pleading to the gallery management for some time for a
150th anniversary exhibition, but after failing to get replies to a
number of letters and phone calls, I was most disappointed in finally
getting a refusal,'' Mr Stewart said.
He added he was also angry at being charged more than #300 by the
department to have photographs taken of five of Knox's works given to
the gallery by Mr Stewart's great- great-aunt.
A spokesman for Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries said that ''a
definitive exhibition'' of Knox's work had been mounted in 1974, ''so it
is a case of having done something in the past''.
He added that the department now planned four to five years ahead and
it would be hard to squeeze in something like a Knox exhibition.
He said that as Mr Stewart had requested colour prints, rather than
the colour transparencies the gallery dealt with, the department had
employed a photographer to take the pictures requested, but nevertheless
a special price had been negotiated.
It is claimed that since the exhibition of Knox's work 20 years ago
more information and previously unknown works have been discovered.
Ms Elspeth King, the director of the Smith Art Gallery and Museum in
Stirling, said that Knox had become known as one of Scotland's first and
most prominent painters of panoramas -- an early form of cinemascope
which allowed members of the general public to see views of battles,
cities and landscapes.
These panoramas, some of them on thousands of square feet of canvas,
were mounted in wooden rotundas, the most famous being in Queen Street
in Glasgow and on The Mound in Edinburgh, and then toured round the
country. Advertisements for these works were carried in the newspapers
of the day and members of the public were charged one shilling for
admission.
All of his panoramas are believed to have been destroyed although
sketches remain. The paintings which hang in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery
and People's Palace in Glasgow may be scaled-down versions of his
panorama works.
Although best known for his landscapes of Glasgow, the Clyde and other
West of Scotland scenery, Knox was originally a portrait painter. He was
a pupil of Alexander Nasmyth and his own pupils included Horatio
McCulloch and Daniel Macnee.
Ms King said: ''He is a major figure in the history of Scottish art.
You could not look at art history in Scotland without assessing the
contribution of John Knox.''
A former Keeper of Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Mr Roger Billcliffe who
now runs his own gallery in Glasgow, said he believed that an exhibition
of Knox's work would have proved very popular. ''These are the kind of
pictures that the general public are very comfortable with,'' he said.
The director of the Fine Art Society in London, Mr Simon Edsor
assessed Knox as ''a good, hugely competent landscape painter but not an
originator in any particular way -- better than a journeyman but not a
leader.''
He added: ''I would have thought that such an exhibition would be very
successful. Many less distinguished painters have been honoured with
exhibitions. I would have thought that John Knox should have one.
''The right place to have it is Glasgow because he was a Glasgow
painter. Rather than fiddle around with bits and pieces of foreign
things, the major duty of a major city art gallery is to honour its
sons.''

<HEADLINE>North Uist hospital confirms outbreak of killer bacteria</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980517120</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE killer 0157 strain of E Coli bacteria has been found at Lochmaddy
Hospital in the Western Isles, it was confirmed last night.
Environmental health officers now are trying to pinpoint the source of
the outbreak in North Uist.
Dairy products at the hospital and samples from patients and staff
have been taken for analysis.
Mr Bryan Barrett, Western Isles assistant environmental health
director, said: ''Our initial tests have shown no further outbreaks at
the hospital. But tests will go on to try and find the source.''
Early preventive measures by staff seem to have contained the outbreak
and now the hospital is open as usual.
Two elderly patients were isolated in the 25-bed hospital last week
after E Coli was suspected. New admissions also were stopped.
One of the patients, a woman, has since died. But her death was not
caused by E Coli although tests carried out in Aberdeen have found that
the bacteria was present.
The bacteria, which lodges in the gut and bowel, has been held
responsible for many recent cases of food poisoning. Elderly patients
are particularly vulnerable.
Meat and dairy products are the usual source and a main symptom is
acute diarrhoea, known as haemorrhagic colitis.
Several elderly patients died following outbreaks in Lanarkshire and
Lothian.
At Hartwood Hospital, Lanarkshire, the outbreak was traced to a local
dairy farm.
However, there is still no clue as to the source of the North Uist
outbreak.
Mr Brian Liddle, general manager of Western Isles' Health Unit, said:
''We can confirm it was the 0157 strain that was identified.
''The environmental health authorities and the Department of Health
are informed and they now making inquiries into the cause of the
outbreak.''
Mr Liddle paid tribute to his staff's quick reactions to news of the
possible outbreak which he said prevented further infection.

THE Lomond Castle Hotel, ravaged by fire in a #4m insurance fraud
attempt, could be turned into luxury homes.
Edinburgh-based developers James Clydesdale Associates have applied to
build 21 luxury flats and townhouses on the site. The flats would have
balconies with views from Arden out over the islands to Ben Lomond.
The hotel, was bought at auction by Dunalastair Estates early last
year. Its former owner, Glasgow businessman Ahmed Maqbool, was jailed
for three years for fraud at the High Court in Edinburgh in 1990.
The plan has been criticised by Loch Lomond-side conservationist Mrs
Hannah Stirling, who received an MBE in the New Year's Honours List.
Mrs Stirling, President of the Friends of Loch Lomond, fears the
development could become a haven for water sports enthusiasts and will
add to mounting concerns about safety on the loch.
''We cannot afford that extra pressure at a time when work is being
done to introduce by-laws to control water sports,'' she said. ''I am
fearful that this development will destroy the peace and tranquillity of
Loch Lomond.''
There is another plan to build nearly 300 houses at Balloch and Mrs
Stirling warned that Loch Lomond could become ''another Lake Geneva''
which is bounded by ''masses of concrete''.
The Lomond Castle proposals will be discussed by Dumbarton District
Council planning committee next month.
* An application for a travel lodge and leisure complex in the grounds
of the hotel has been lodged with the council by Mr Donald Wilkie, 35,
formerly of Tullichewan Caravan Park at Balloch.

SOLDIER John Norris was so deeply affected by searching for bodies
after the Lockerbie disaster that he began having nightmares, took drugs
to keep him awake at night and left the Army, a court was told
yesterday.
The former Royal Highland Fusilier was shown leniency by a judge at
the High Court in Glasgow when he admitted possessing amphetamine and
cannabis resin.
Lord Allanbridge fined Norris, 30, now of Reay Street, Inverness,
#200.
Defending advocate Allan Nicol told the court: ''The horror of
Lockerbie proved a harrowing experience for Norris and he could not stop
the nightmares which followed.
''His only escape from the terrible dreams was to stay awake and he
took to taking drugs, and left the Army.''
In the dock with Norris was John McLeod, 36, who admitted being
concerned in the supply of cannabis resin at his house at Kirkwall
Street, Greenock on September 10.
McLeod also admitted possessing amphetamine and a double-barrelled,
sawn-off shotgun.
Norris admitted possessing amphetamine and cannabis resin in McLeod's
house and at his former home at Dee Street, Greenock.
The judge, who was told McLeod had previous convictions, jailed him
for three years and six months.
Mr Iain Bonomy, QC, prosecuting, said police raided Mcleod's home and
found various small quantities of drugs worth several hundred pounds
hidden all over the house.
Police also found a shotgun and several 12-bore cartridges.
Norris had amphetamine in a camera film container hidden in his
underwear, some cannabis resin and #265 in cash.
Mr Nicol said that, since the offence, Norris had moved with his wife
and and two children to Inverness, and was now off drugs. He had left
the Army in 1989 after serving six years.
Mr William Dunlop, defending, said McLeod only bought drugs for
friends and acquaintances and his dealing was at the lower end of the
scale.
The shotgun belonged to a relative, who had got into trouble with the
police and had been forced on him.

THE Government is to give careful consideration to the way in which
Highland Regional Council formulated its planning blueprint for the
Black Isle before it allows the council to adopt it.
As The Herald exclusively revealed last month, the Scottish Office
made an unprecedented, last-minute intervention to prevent the council
adopting the plan. The move was welcomed by local residents campaigning
against the plan which they believe will damage the rural quality of the
area.
Last summer, the council faced stinging criticism from a Scottish
Office inquiry reporter over what he believed was a history of
ineffective planning controls over housing on the Black Isle.
The proposed Black Isle plan, the council's planning blueprint for the
next 10 years, would mean a continuation of these lenient controls in
order to help ease the housing congestion in Inverness.
Local MP Charles Kennedy recently asked the Government what the
official thinking on the plan now was. Scottish Office Local Government
Minister Allan Stewart replied that Scots Secretary Ian Lang had to
consider the adoption of a local plan within 28 days.
''He may extend this period if he considers it necessary,'' Mr Stewart
stated. ''In the case of the revised Black Isle Local Plan, the period
has been extended to allow more time to consider whether the plan's
policies and proposals raise issues of more than local importance.
''I cannot say, at this stage, when a final decision will be
announced, but every effort will be made to do so at the earliest
opportunity. I can also assure the Honourable Member that full and
careful consideration will be given to the manner in which this matter
has been handled by Highland Regional Council, and the objections
received, before a decision is reached.''
Mr Kennedy said last night that he was encouraged by the substance of
Mr Stewart's reply. ''It seems clear that the alarm bells have started
ringing within the Scottish Office that all is not well, both over
aspects of the plan's content and the way in which it has been
handled.''

AN ELDERLY couple and their handicapped daughter were lucky to be
alive after a gas explosion almost ripped their Inverness council house
apart yesterday morning. The Health and Safety Executive will begin an
investigation today.
Firemen described it as a miraculous escape and the local MP, Sir
Russell Johnston, said that he would be looking for a full explanation
from British Gas given that this had happened following reports that the
company had been cutting back on their safety expenditure.
''We should know what happened, why it happened and who was
responsible as soon as possible. When something like this happens
everyone with gas gets worried.''
Mr Jimmy Ross, 82, a retired painter, went to the kitchen to make
toast just after 8.30am when the cooker exploded blowing out a window
and the front and rear walls of the house, which is in Bruce Gardens.
Afterwards it looked as though the house was being torn apart, but Mr
Ross was left with only flash burns.
His wife Jessie and their daughter were still in their bedroom when
the blast occurred and suffered only minor injuries. All three were
taken to Raigmore Hospital for treatment but only Mr Ross was detained.
Mr Mike MacDougall, an Inverness joiner, was walking past the house in
the quiet residential part of the Highland capital when he heard the
blast. Then he saw Mr Ross appear at his front window. ''He seemed quite
calm and told me there had been a gas explosion. I could see that the
front wall had been blown away from the roof and it looked in danger of
collapsing.
''I told him to stay where he was and I would get him out. I went
round to the back of the house where there was more structural damage.
The kitchen door was jammed but I managed to break it down and get in.
Mr Ross was still in his pyjamas and had singed hair and slight burns.
His wife and daughter also appeared.''
Mr Tom Deans of British Gas's public affairs office in Edinburgh told
The Herald: ''We are not really involved although obviously we will be
helping the Health and Safety Executive in its inquiry. Basically we
supply the gas but it would be up to the local council to maintain the
equipment.''
A spokesman for Inverness District Council's architects' department
confirmed that the council was responsible for maintaining the gas
heating system but not the cooker. That was the responsibility of the
tenant. He said that a decision would be made later as to whether it
would be economically sensible to the rebuild house.

THE fire which gutted part of Parliament Buildings in Belfast was most
likely caused by an electrical fault, it was revealed last night.
Forensic experts have traced the start of the blaze to wiring behind
the Speaker's Chair in the Commons Chamber.
And they have found no evidence of arson, sources close to the
investigation said.
Last night's disclosure that the blaze was an accident came as the
Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, announced the setting up
of an independent inquiry into Monday's fire, which has left a
restoration bill expected to be around #1.5m.
There were no fire alarms or sprinkler system in operation.
Sir Patrick has asked Sir Reginald Doyle, a former Chief Inspector of
Fire Services in Great Britain, to examine fire safety precautions and
firefighting arrangements at the Stormont building, the former Northern
Ireland Parliament.
The Ulster Secretary said: ''Given the understandable public concern
about Parliament Buildings, I have decided to seek an independent strand
of advice which will take account of all the circumstances relating to
the recent fire.''
The Goverment is already under pressure by some Unionist MPs over the
lack of proper fire safety precautions in many of its buildings.
throughout Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick said he was concerned about the fears expressed.
''Government takes most seriously its reponsibilities to all who work
in Crown buildings or have occasion to use them. Safety has always been
a predominant consideration in the construction and maintenance of these
buildings and will continue to be so.''
Nobody was inside Parliament Buildings at the time of the blaze. Staff
were still on Christmas holidays and so too were workmen involved in
refurbishment.
It is understood some of them have been questioned as part of the
investigation into the cause of the fire.
It is still not clear if that part of the building -- which has been
used for talks between senior civil servants, Sinn Fein and loyalist
representatives -- will be open when the sides resume their exploratory
dialogue later this month.

THE SCOTTISH rail network is now under greater threat than it was at
the time of the Beeching cuts in the early 1960s, Inverness, Nairn and
Lochaber MP Sir Russell Johnston warned yesterday.
Sir Russell was speaking at a news conference in Inverness along with
his fellow Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy whose Ross, Cromarty, and
Skye constituency is immediately to the north of Inverness.
Sir Russell said that he had taken part in the anti-Beeching campaign
which had been fought on an all-party basis. He was now looking to the
Labour Party, the Scottish National Party, and the Liberal Democrat MPs
to join forces to fight again.
''First and foremost of the issues this year will be the future of our
rail services. The threat to the Fort William sleepers, the Mallaig
steam train, and motorail are all dire warnings of what is to come.
''A lot of people don't seem to have caught on to what is going to
happen to motorail, but it is quite appalling. All motorail services in
the UK will be terminated in May unless the Government can be swayed by
a scream of protest.
''We are meeting Roger Salmon, director of franchising, in 10 days
time to press the case. He is the person who has recommended not only
the cut in the subsidy to the Fort William sleeper service, but also the
complete abolition of motorail.''
Sir Russell added: ''Some may say that only 20,000 cars a year use the
services, but that is 20,000 extra cars that will be decanted on to the
roads instead. That in itself is environmentally barbaric. But it is
also so out of step with what is happening elsewhere in Europe.''
Charles Kennedy agreed. ''Thomas Cook's European rail timetable
reveals that at the moment there are no fewer than 247 international and
304 internal motorail routes in Europe, and from May 1995 Britain will
have none. Now what kind of policy incoherence when you have just built
a channel tunnel.''
Neither of the MPs believed that the Inverness services would remain
unaffected despite Mr Salmon's assurance.
The most likely outcome would be that services would be routed through
Aberdeen and the service from Perth through the Central Highlands would
be lost.
Mr Kennedy said that it was time that Scottish Tory MPs realised that
their constiuents would lose services as well.

<TEXT>
A LABOUR group yesterday faced a ''jobs for the boys'' row when it
filled a vacant councillor's post.
It had previously been accused of driving a colleague from the seat,
the Collydean/Balgeddie ward of Glenrothes.
Kirkcaldy District Council voted to co-opt Mr Bill Kay, a 60-year-old
businessman and the secretary of the Labour party's north Glenrothes
branch.
SNP members demanded that no-one should be appointed to represent the
ward until the elections for the shadow Fife unitary authority in April.
Councillor Wilma Jones had resigned the seat amid complaints that
colleagues had made life ''unbearable'' for her because she supported
the successful battle for compensation by a dismissed worker.
Because of local government reform, the Scottish Secretary has ruled
that no by-elections should be held before the formation of the new
unitary authorities, which means councils can simply appoint a
replacement.
In May Mr Kay lost the Leslie/Collydean regional council seat,
previously held by Labour with a 473 majority, to the SNP.
His co-option to the council was moved at a full meeting yesterday by
administration leader, Councillor Christine May and Councillor Jim
Lewis, who said the area needed to be represented by someone with Mr
Kay's qualities.
The SNP opposed the move. Mr Peter Grant described it as ''jobs for
the boys'' and said the seat should be left vacant until April.
He claimed the blame for the vacancy lay fairly and squarely with
Labour, accusing it of hounding Councillor Jones out.
SNP group leader, Mr David Alexander, said Mr Kay did not live in
Glenrothes and had polled the lowest vote of any Kirkcaldy district
Labour candidate at the regional elections.
He accused Labour of behaving like a quango, adding ''it's the
clearest case of jobs for the boys I have ever seen''.
Councillor May said Mr Kay was well qualified to sit as a councillor.
Mr Kay said later he would build on what Mrs Jones had done.
He said he would seek to ensure a ''smooth transition'' of public
housing from Glenrothes Development Corporation to Kirkcaldy District
Council, which is bidding to become the new landlord when the
corporation is wound up.

TALKS are taking place this week with about 60 staff at Bristow
Helicopters' Aberdeen base who are likely to lose their jobs.
The Herald revealed last November that large scale redundancies were
likely and in December staff were told that there would be job losses on
a selective basis -- not necessarily last in first out -- brought about
because of a 30% downturn in business.
Captain Tony Jones, the company's Scottish general manager, said
yesterday that throughout this week members of staff who were on a
provisional list for ''unfortunate executive action'' were being talked
to.
He said this was to allow discussion of their positions, to see if
there was any way they could be retained, and to determine if the
management's decision making process was adequate.
It allowed a breathing space to work out a final list of those who
would lose their jobs which would be completed before the end of this
month. Captain Jones said that to give any indication of the numbers
likely to lose their jobs would be to prejudge the outcome of the
discussions and would be unfair. However, The Herald believes it to be
about 60.
''A substantial number of people have eased the situation for us by
volunteering for redundancy,'' added Captain Jones.
Bristow Helicopters employs about 575 of its 1000 UK workforce in
Aberdeen and employs 2000 worldwide. Changes in oilfield work patterns
and a reduction in drilling operations has led to a decline in
helicopter work.

DEMAND for National Lottery cash topped the #1 billion mark within
hours of administrators opening for business yesterday.
The vast bulk of the cash is wanted by sports groups -- but arts
organisations also have asked for around #100m.
The amount being asked for is over 10 times more than the #96.5m
raised for good causes by the lottery in its first six weeks.
More than 50 applications for lottery aid were delivered to the Arts
Council, the Sports Council, the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the
Millennium Fund yesterday -- the first day bids could be officially
lodged.
All four groups expect to be inundated with applications in the coming
weeks.
The Scottish Arts Council received a small number of applications in
yesterday's mail.
However, a spokeswoman said: ''We have been advising potential
applicants to take their time and send in well-thought-out bids. They
appear to be heeding that.''
Funds also will be distributed in Scotland by the Scottish Sports
Council.
Officials in England said that the applications related to a wide
range of large and small projects.
Probably the most high-profile bid was made by the Royal Opera House,
which wants about #50m from the Arts Council for the redevelopment of
its theatre in Covent Garden, London.
Several major organisations, including the Tate Gallery and Sheffield
City Council, have plans to make huge bids for project funding.
Charities will have to wait for several weeks before they can lodge
bids because the National Lottery Charities Board is not yet ready to
receive applications.
The delay has angered Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith, who says
Home Secretary Michael Howard has been to slow to appoint the board's
chief executive and issue policy directions.

Mr Michael Fay, 28, and Mr Raymond Henfrey, 25, were accused of killing
Mr Kenneth Syme, 48, by throwing him from the window of a third-floor
tenement. Mr McGuire, of Watchmeal Crescent, Faifley, Dunbartonshire,
was also charged with assaulting Mr Syme by punching and kicking him.
The offences are alleged to have taken place at Mr McGuire's address,
which he shares with Mr Fay. Mr Henfrey, of Lennox Drive, Faifley, was
also charged with three breaches of bail. The body of Mr Syme, of
Fuller's Gate, Faifley, was found by a nine-year-old child on New Year's
Day.

<TEXT>
THE Post Office was criticised last night after it was revealed that
compensation for parcels lost during delivery had been drastically cut.
Parcelforce, the package-carrying arm, has cut one level of
compensation from #5000 to #500 and halved another from #1000 to #500.
The Post Office Users' National Council said the change was introduced
quietly late last year. Its officials said they had not been told of the
change, and learned of it through a report in an internal Post Office
newspaper.
The Post Office said the changes had been made to bring Parcelforce's
levels of compensation into line with rival private firms.
The secretary of the users' council, Mr Ken Hall, said: ''We are
unhappy about the changes and unhappy that we weren't told. They are
under no legal obligation to let us know, but it is something we would
have expected to be told about. We have made representations to the Post
Office and outlined our dissatisfaction, but nothing has changed.''
The cut from #5000 to #500 was for lost packages in the Datapost 10-12
hour service. That of #1000 to #500 was in the Parcelforce 24-48 hour
service.
A Post Office spokesman confirmed that the cuts outlined by the
council were correct.
''We told 30,000 contractors of the changes and have not had one
complaint,'' he said.
Parcelforce loses money and is having an uphill struggle against
rivals such as TNT, White Arrow, and Red Star.
Late last year it announced the loss of 1000 jobs after losing a key
contact -- with publisher Reader's Digest -- to White Arrow.
The Post Office says that Parcelforce's troubles have not been eased
by the failure of the Government's privatisation plans last year.
It says Parcelforce needs greater commercial freedom to fight
competition and introduce the latest technology.

<RECORDNO>980517132</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom was yesterday challenged to drop rises in telephone
rental charges -- or face the consequences of pensioners losing a
lifeline.
Labour MP George Foulkes, chairman of the all-party pensioners' group,
warned that thousands of old people could be left isolated and
vulnerable because they could not afford a telephone.
BT caused outrage by announcing that line rentals were to rise by 4.6%
-- almost twice the rate of inflation and the maximum permitted by the
industry watchdog.
Pensioners' groups fear the charge, adding #1.10 to quarterly bills,
could hit hardest those who can least afford it.
They stepped up pressure for line rentals to be scrapped and the cost
transferred to ordinary call charges.
Mr Foulkes said: ''The telephone is a lifeline for many old people. It
is the only way they can keep in touch with relatives and the emergency
services.
''Many hundreds and perhaps even thousands could now forego a
telephone because of the rental cost and risk death as well because they
have cut their link with the outside world and the emergency services.''
Mr Foulkes said the problem was made worse by standing charges on
electricity and gas which combine with phone rental to account for more
than 10% of many old people's income.

<RECORDNO>980517133</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EXPLORATORY drilling for oil and gas under Windsor Castle was given
the go-ahead yesterday.
The Queen has consented to the controversial scheme, which would
involve drilling a borehole 300-400 metres deep in Windsor Home Park,
600 metres south-east of the castle.
An application by Canuk Exploration was assisted by a recommendation
by Berkshire County Council officers that temporary planning permission
be granted for initial drilling.
In a report to Berkshire councillors on the development control and
waste regulation committee, which approved the scheme, the county's
environment officer said: ''The site is located in an area where noise,
general disturbance and visual impact would be minimal.''
The royal borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, and the Council for the
Protection of Rural England objected to the proposal, arguing that
drilling would be inappropriate on an environmentally sensitive and
historic site situated in green belt parkland.
The county council report said there was approximately a one-in-eight
chance of discovering oil and gas.
The State, and not the Queen, would stand to gain most from any find.
Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the council decision.
There were protests from councillors in the Windsor area. County
councillor John Maisie said there had been letters from as far afield as
Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil and Israel, protesting at the
effect of drilling for oil.
''The Castle and Home Park must surely be at the very heart of our
national heritage, with over four million people visiting it,'' he said.
As the application was approved with a show of hands, there were cries
of ''shame on you'' from a number of councillors.
Earlier the committee had been told the council had recieved no
letters of protest from members of the public.
Planning officer Mark Balchin said the drilling would be carried out
over an eight-week period, but the rig was only likely to be in place
for 14 days.
Afterwards, the hole was expected to be plugged with cement and the
site reinstated as grassland.

LACK of resources and manpower, caused mainly by the flooding crisis
in Strathclyde, led to a big reduction in the number of drivers being
breath-tested over the festive period.
A senior police source admitted yesterday that resources had been
strained because of the flooding in the west of Scotland last month as
well as the scale of the force's recent Operation Turnkey, which stopped
cars suspected of transporting stolen goods.
The number of drivers found to be over the limit on Scotland's roads
over the festive fortnight was down by seven on the previous year, but
6276 fewer drivers were breathalysed. This was due entirely to the
figures in Strathclyde, where 24,280 drivers were tested compared to
32,716 for the previous year.
In spite of the decline in the number of tests, Scottish police
yesterday hailed their anti-drink driving campaign as a success, saying
there was a downward trend in positive and refused tests. Yet 2.3% of
those who took a breath-test were over the legal alcohol limit compared
to 2.1% over the same period last year.
Yesterday Mr Ian Mackinnon, Strathclyde's assistant chief constable,
said the campaign had successfully reduced the number of drink-drivers
on the road.
''If you go back to when we first ran the campaign (in 1986), positive
tests were running at almost 19% -- we have brought that down
steadily,'' he said.
Mr Mackinnon acknowledged that fewer people had been stopped in
1994-95 -- 47,566 as compared to 53,862 in 1993-94 -- but he said that
positive tests were down all the same.
The Roads Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said he was
''extremely disappointed'' by the percentage rise in the number of
drink-drivers who failed or refused a breath-test.
''The police have continued to mount a substantial drink-drive
campaign over the festive season with over 47,000 breath-tests carried
out and they have my full support in this.
''Motorists must realise that their chances of being caught if they
drink-drive are now substantial, not only over the festive period but
throughout the year,'' he said.
Mr Neil Grieg, the AA's roads and environment officer in Scotland,
said the problem seemed to be that the police were now coming up against
a hard core of drinkers who refused to pay heed to anti-drink driving
campaigns.
An official of the RAC said it was extremely difficult to compare one
year to the next when the number of tests varied.
''Looking at it on the surface I suppose any decrease in positive
tests is encouraging,'' she said. ''But it is disappointing that they
didn't give it the priority that it needs.''
In Dumfries and Galloway, 3.5% of all drivers tested were positive as
compared to 4.2% for the same period the year before. Central region was
down from 52 to 49 while Northern Constabulary reported disappointing
results with two more positive tests than last year.
* A record 400 motorists -- including at least six police officers --
will face Christmas drink-drive charges in Northern Ireland.
They were caught in an RUC offensive in the run-up to New Year. Two
were stopped on their way to work in 8am road checks.
Chief Superintendent Eugene Kearney, head of the RUC traffic branch,
confirmed: ''It's inevitable that in a campaign of this scale some
police officers will be tested.
''If found over the limit they will face the full consequences.
''I don't have a great deal of sympathy for anyone, irrespective of
their occupation or profession, who is caught drinking and driving. It's
irresponsible and unacceptable and they are posing a great threat to
road safety.''

DRASTIC cuts in drinking water lead levels could cost the Government
nearly #13bn in the next 15 years. The anti-pollution proposals
announced by the European Commission include an 80% reduction in the
maximum permitted levels of lead -- from 50 microgrammes a litre to 10
microgrammes. If approved by EU governments, the move would mean huge
changes throughout the country with most of the improvements involving
modernising water pipes in private houses. Just who foots the bill is
not clear, but the estimated total cost in the 12 member states is put
at about #40bn.

POLICE yesterday named two elderly women who died within hours of each
other in separate house fires, both involving electric fires.
They were Miss Johnan Reid, 92, of South Trinity Road, Trinity,
Edinburgh, and Mrs Isabella Adams, 74, of Forthview Crescent, Currie, on
the outskirts of the city.
Miss Reid, who walked with the aid of a Zimmer, is believed to have
knocked over an electric fire in her living-room and been unable to get
up again.
It is thought that Mrs Adams may have taken ill in her living-room and
fallen over her fire.
The fire in Miss Reid's home was discovered by police when they went
there after a friend informed them that she was not answering her
telephone.
Before firemen arrived, an officer broke into the bungalow, but was
beaten back by thick smoke.
Mrs Adams was found lying over the electric fire by her husband,
Thomas, who had to be admitted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary suffering
from shock and the effects of smoke.
Police said that there was nothing suspicious about either of the
fires, but that reports on the two incidents would be submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.

THE ''caring, sharing'' Co-op was yesterday branded Britain's most
expensive supermarket.
Consumer watchdogs say the stores group, set up 150 years ago as a
workers' alternative to greedy and unscrupulous traders, now charges the
most for groceries.
The discount store chain Kwik Save, whose prices for a basket of goods
have dropped 50p in the past year, was named the cheapest supermarket
chain.
In a survey the Consumers' Association Which? magazine examined prices
at nine major supermarket chains.
Researchers visited 48 branches across 11 areas in Scotland and
England.
The average cost of the basket of 32 branded goods, including Andrex
toilet rolls, Heinz tomato soup, and Whiskas cat food was #27.07. This
was just 3p up from the same time last year.
The Co-op's price for the same goods was #28.70: an increase of #1.17.
The Co-op has 2500 stores nationwide, including more than 160 in
Scotland.
The basket of goods at Kwik Save was #3.31 cheaper than the Co-op at
#25.39.
When comparing own-brand goods, the Co-op still fared poorly with the
second most expensive prices.
Among average supermarket prices, Lyons filter coffee has increased
the most, by 62p, while the biggest reduction was in Heineken lager --
down 34p.
The Co-op said the survey did not accurately represent its pricing
policy.
A spokesman said: ''We operate convenience stores, supermarkets, and
large out-of-town superstores. Prices in our convenience stores may be
slightly higher, but we think people are prepared to pay more at these
sites.
''Prices at our larger supermarkets will be competitively priced with
other big supermarket groups like Sainsbury and Tesco.''
0 The shopping basket prices for branded goods were: Kwik Save --
#25.39; Asda -- #25.89; Morrisons -- #26.20; Sainsbury's -- #27.16;
Tesco -- #27.21; Safeway -- #27.23; Gateway -- #27.52; Waitrose --
#28.47; Co-op -- #28.70.
* The Co-op was formed in Rochdale, Lancashire, in 1844, by a group of
26 working men who decided to fight traders charging high prices for
goods.

PRINCE William took a step on the road of responsibility yesterday by
leading a photocall during his skiing holiday with his father and
brother Harry.
The 12-year-old Prince, watched by his approving father from a window,
brought together his brother and cousins for a rare picture of four of
the Queen's grandchildren outside their hotel at Klosters in
Switzterland.
But his hopes of getting things over briskly were upset by the
paparazzi, hot on the scent of pictures of his father kissing their
chaperone outside a restaurant.
With the price rising to more than #50,000, speculation was rife about
the exact nature of the kiss allegedly between Prince Charles and Tiggy
Legge-Bourke, 29.
William, who now takes an active part in discussing media relations
with his father, was said to be ''very disappointed'' at this latest
example of the problems of being a member of the modern royal family.
Commander Richard Aylard, Prince Charles's private secretary, told
reporters that William had felt the photocall went well but now had no
enthusiasm for further co-operation during the holiday.
Miss Legge-Bourke accompanies William and Harry and also acts as diary
organiser for Prince Charles. Her official title is personal assistant
to Commander Aylard.
Commander Aylard said any question of impropriety was ludicrous. ''It
is a normal, polite, social thing to do. The Prince kisses lots of
people,'' Commander Aylard said.

EMPLOYMENT prospects for graduates are improving but recruitment is
not keeping pace with the numbers leaving higher education, the
Association of Graduate Recruiters reports today.
The mixed news for students, graduates and employers comes in the
association's graduate salaries and vacancies survey, which gives trends
in pay and recruitment in the last year and forecasts from companies for
the next 12 months.
The association represents employers from industry, commerce, and the
public sector who provide a large proportion of graduate vacancies in
the UK.
The main findings about graduate vacancies and recruitment show:
* A 2.3% increase in recruitment last year over 1993.
* A mixed pattern of recruitment, with 40% of employers cutting back
and 11% reporting no change.
* A recruitment shortfall, despite rising graduate output. Many
employers are still finding difficulty filling vacancies in engineering,
science, and management trainee posts.
* A 10.3% increase in demand for graduates, when actual recruitment
and shortfall in recruitment last year are compared with actual
recruitment in 1993.
* Optimistic forecasts for vacancies in the medium term. More than 80%
of employers are optimistic about graduate vacancies and intend to
maintain or increase current levels.
Despite rapid increases in the number of graduates, some employers
face recruitment difficulties. Kate Orebi Gann, the association's
chairman and recruitment manager for Marks and Spencer, says:
''Employers receive 100 or more applications for each vacancy but they
are still having some trouble finding the right graduate for the job.''
The survey also shows that the average graduate starting salary last
year was #13,500, 0.7% higher than the increase in average earnings over
the previous year.
Average graduate salaries are forecast to rise to #14,000 this year.
Meanwhile, women are losing the struggle to close the pay gap on men,
and the Government appears quite happy to see it happen, according to
Labour's Scottish employment spokesman, Mr John McFall.
He claimed yesterday that a survey by the Manchester School of
Management showed that while the gap between male and female earnings
had closed slightly in the rest of the European Union since 1980, it had
actually widened in the UK.
For manual jobs, women's earnings are between 67% and 84% of men's
average earnings. For non-manual occupations, women's earnings range
between 55% and 58% of male colleagues.
''This trend shows just how important Labour's policies on employment
protection, such as signing up for the Social Chapter and establishing a
minimum wage are,'' he commented.

THE Scott Inquiry into whether government Ministers connived in arming
Saddam Hussein before the Gulf War, could hang over the Prime Minister
for almost another year. Ministers, such as Chancellor Kenneth Clarke,
with their careers at stake, were hoping for a result this spring.
However, Lord Justice Scott has informed Whitehall that he needs more
time to get to the bottom of the matter, which caused an Old Bailey
trial to be aborted and put the liberty of directors of Matrix Churchill
engineers at stake.
Mr Clarke has said that if the inquiry finds fault in his conduct as
Home Secretary at the time, he will resign.
The political futures of Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell and Mr
William Waldegrave, ex-Foreign Office and now Minister of Agriculture,
are also on the line. The core of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry is
whether such Ministers misused their power to withold vital evidence.
Lord Scott is said to be keen to establish that Parliament should not
be in recess when his findings are published. He wants to take more
written evidence and study thousands of complicated papers before he
produces his report, now scheduled for October.
He has so far interviewed 166 witnesses in public, including Baroness
Thatcher, and 54 other politicians over the last 12 months. There have
been nearly 500 hours of public hearings. He is determined to identify
and pinpoint responsibility despite political embarrassment.
Matrix Churchill directors faced up to seven years in jail before
former Trade and Industry Minister Alan Clark's testimony at the Old
Bailey that he knew that their machinery could be used for military
purposes. Despite this, export of the machinery was authorised.
The trial judge and MPs on all sides were outraged by the possibility
that Ministers ''gagging'' certificates on evidence might have brought
about a miscarriage of justice. Labour has accused the Government of
being prepared to let innocent men go to jail rather than admit to
authorising their conduct.

A LABOUR MP has demanded the Government takes action on the future of
the derelict Gartcosh steelworks in Lanarkshire.
In a letter to the Prime Minister, Monklands West MP Tom Clarke has
called upon the Government either to back a paper recycling plant,
mooted six years ago, or to ensure the site is returned to Scottish
Enterprise for industrial development.
''In an area where unemployment, poverty and social deprivation stand
at unacceptably high levels, my constituents are entitled to expect
action rather than lethargy, concern instead of indifference,'' said Mr
Clarke.
He was joined in his demand for action by three of the 560 former
workers at the Gartcosh plant: Mr George Cole, a former engineer; Mr
George Greechan, a former crane-driver; and Mr Charlie Blades, a former
plumber.
Mr Greechan said: ''It is the young people who have never had a job
that I feel sorry for. They do not know what it is to work.''
A consortium led by North British Newsprint planned to invest #240m in
a paper recycling plant. However, market conditions have prevented its
launch, and only 30 people are employed in a small-scale paper recycling
operation on the site.
Mr Clarke said: ''If it does not get off the ground it is the
responsibility of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for
Scotland.''
Mr Christopher Wilkins, chairman of North British Newsprint, said:
''In principle I wish to develop Gartcosh as a newsprint recycling mill
but I accept that if that cannot be then it would be correct for us to
sell it to Scottish Enterprise to do something else with it.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''There has been no formal
approach made to the Government through the Scottish Office for grant
support. Any approach by the company for financial support would be
given careful consideration.''

A SCOTS teenager was recovering at home yesterday after a meningitis
scare.
Donna Nixon, 18, of Dumbuie Avenue, Silverton, Dumbarton, has been
fighting the bacterial form of the virus, meningococcal meningitis.
It can cause septicaemia or blood poisoning, but doctors say there is
no question of an outbreak in the area of the disease which has claimed
lives in England.
Donna, a student at North Glasgow College, Springburn, became ill a
week before Christmas. It began with what looked like a rash and she was
later taken to Ruchill Hospital and treated at the infectious diseases
unit.
When her condition deteriorated she was transferred to the Western
Infirmary, Glasgow. She recovered quickly and was back home on December
23.
Her family has been offered a course of antibiotics and college
classmates have been told they are not at risk.
Dr David Sloan, public health medicine consultant for the Argyll and
Clyde Health Board, said Donna's speedy recovery was ''gratifying'.
He added: ''The septicaemic form of the virus can kill up to 25% of
those who fall victim to it. This patient was obviously very fit and
resilient.
''Other teenagers with this virus have taken up to three weeks to
recover and a 16-year-old Paisley teenager died from the virus last
year.''
* Yesterday, the families of two girls who died of meningitis after an
outbreak at a village school in Rottingdean, East Sussex, hugged and
wept with each other as the first victim, Emma Harris, was buried.
Her classmate and best friend Alexandra Yates died on Tuesday night
after a 10-day fight against the disease.
Five-year-old Emma died on Boxing Day. She fell ill shortly after
opening her Christmas presents.
Emma's coffin was buried within sight of Rottingdean Church of England
school which she had attended for just one term.
As the white coffin was lowered into the grave, Emma's parents, David
and Sally, and Alexandra's parents, Alan and Elizabeth, hugged each
other in a show of strength.
Health officials, still mystified as to why the outbreak hit the
school, will take swabs from all 220 pupils when they return there next
week.

SNP LEADER Alex Salmond is planning to disrupt this year's annual
general meeting of British Gas. He is organising a group of disgruntled
shareholders to challenge the direction the company is taking and the
policies of the board.
Mr Salmond has been in touch with the British Gas company secretary,
John Jackson, and has established that he needs 100 shareholders with an
average paid-up sum per member of #100 to put down a written motion.
He is planning meetings over the next few weeks with what he describes
as ''other dissident shareholders'' to discuss the exact wording of what
is likely to turn into a motion of censure.
The SNP leader told The Herald yesterday: ''Correspondence with
British Gas has made it clear that 100 shareholders are required to
mount a formal challenge to the policies and direction of the present
British Gas senior management team.
''The year l994 has been a fiasco for the company, and I am confident
that the target of 100 shareholders can easily be met in time for the
agm (scheduled for May 31). It is clear that our attack will focus on
the widespread concern that exists over the actions of the board in
1994.
''Whether the motion should be narrowly drawn or range over the whole
spectrum of the company's failings in 1994 -- executive pay rises, a
two-tier price structure, staff pay cuts, cuts in maintenance
expenditure, the elimination of the Scottish management tier, closure of
showrooms and payment facilities -- there is clearly a groundswell of
opposition that can be tapped.''
Mr Salmond, who holds about 100 shares in British Gas, last year led a
union-backed demonstration at the agm which attracted considerable
support, but this year he believes the opportunity exists to present a
broader and more organised challenge to the people who, he claims are
''leading the company to disaster.''
He said: ''There is huge disquiet among shareholders and customers and
the best way to unite the dissident groupings is probably through a
specific motion at the agm. I have already received dozens of proxy
offers following a television broadcast last year.
''Realistically, the likelihood is that the chairman will be sitting
at the agm with the bulk of institutional proxies safely in his pocket,
but we can hope to give both him and chief executive Cedric Brown a run
for their money in 1995.''
A British Gas spokesman said last night: ''Mr Salmond is acting within
his rights and is entitled, like any other shareholder, to submit a
motion provided it is within the requirements of the Companies Act.
''What we would say is that we are going through a period of enormous
change and reorganisation. This inevitably leads to some stresses and
strains and that is what we are experiencing. But we are committed to
giving our customers a high-quality, good-value service and are
determined to continue to do so.''

TERESA Gorman, the Tory MP, will fight a threat to prosecute her for
allegedly breaching planning laws by renovating her fifteenth century
home.
Thurrock Council's planning committee will today consider what action
to take over 33 reported breaches of rules governing changes to listed
buildings.
Planners claim that the Billericay MP has turned her previously
decaying Grade II listed Tudor farmhouse at Orsett, Essex, into a
''pseudo-medieval'' building without seeking permission.
In a report circulated with the committee's agenda just before
Christmas, the chief planning officer, Mr Peter Shelley, recommended
that the Labour-controlled authority prosecute Mrs Gorman and her
husband, Jim.
The maximum sentence for altering a listed building without consent is
six months in prison and a #250,000 fine.
Mrs Gorman, one of the rebel MPs expelled from the parliamentary Tory
Party for opposing the Government over Europe, accused the council of
conducting a ''trial by media'' against her.
''The first I knew of this agenda was when I read it in the press and
I was never given an opportunity to consider it prior to its being
released to the media,'' she said last night.
''The fact that the agenda was given to the press before I had sight
of it and whilst I was abroad appears to me to constitute a trial by
media.
''I am appalled by what has happened and wish to make it clear that I
fully intend to challenge these allegations and the manner in which the
agenda was released.''
The council wants the building returned to the state in which the
Gormans bought it in 1992 and maintains that their ''history replacement
therapy'' has seen Tudor features demolished, windows, doors, and a
porch added, fake timbers attached, and partitions removed.
Mrs Gorman will be out of the country until the weekend.

BRITAIN'S best-known children's hospital has gratefully accepted a #5m
donation from businessman Octav Botnar, exiled since being accused of
taking part in a huge fraud.
Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital Fund yesterday announced that
Mr Botnar, the founder and head of Nissan UK, has donated the money, the
largest sum ever given by an individual.
In 1989, Nissan UK donated #8m to the hospital, which established the
Camelia Botnar pathology laboratories, named in memory of Mr Botnar's
daughter.
Romanian-born Mr Botnar has remained in Switzerland since he was
accused of masterminding evasion of #55m corporation tax.
He also faces a #65m tax bill on the dividends from his Nissan UK
shares.
Sir Anthony Tippet, chief executive of Great Ormond Street Hospital
Trust, said: ''It is difficult to find words which do justice to the
scale of Mr Botnar's generosity.''
A spokesman for Mr Botnar said yesterday's donation had no connection
with any of the funds in dispute.
The multi-millionaire businessman still fully intended to return to
Britain to deal with the allegations against him, but his health had not
been good, he said.

A STOCKY softly-spoken Scot is one of the three Parkhurst escapees.
All have been described as ''extremely dangerous'' by police.
Andrew Rodger, 44, is believed to be originally from Ayrshire, but
moved to Ilford in East London some years ago.
Strathclyde police have been contacted by Hampshire police about the
escape, although there is nothing to suggest that Rodger, jailed for
life for the murder of a swimming pool attendant, would attempt to
return to Scotland.
Rodger was sentenced to life in November 1987 at the Central Criminal
Court in London after he bludgeoned to death the 54-year-old pool
attendant with a crowbar after he was caught stealing from a vending
machine.
Hampshire police say Rodger is 5ft 7in, very stocky, and has retained
his Scottish accent.
Keith Rose, a computer company director, was jailed for life in 1991
for murdering Mrs Juliet Rowe, wife of the head of a grocery chain, at
her home in Devon in 1981 in a bungled kidnap attempt.
Matthew Williams, a student, was jailed for life after admitting 11
charges including arson, theft and conspiracy to cause explosions.
Liverpool Crown Court heard that Williams's hero was Hitler. He
planned to turn the earth into a desert by combining the common cold
virus with rabies, the court heard.
Rose is 6ft tall, with a long grey, extremely unkempt beard. Williams,
is 6ft 1in, with short black hair, slight build, and speaks with a
Merseyside accent.

<TEXT>
HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley yesterday defended pay rises
averaging 6.6% for NHS trust chief executives while other public-sector
workers had increases pegged to 1.5%.
Mrs Bottomley said NHS managers had a difficult job to do in seeing
through a ''real transformation in services,'' which had led to a more
efficient NHS.
She claimed there were problems in making comparisons between the pay
of health service managers and other workers.
The survey by Income Data Services, published yesterday, contrasts the
pay rises given to NHS trust chief executives and other health service
workers.
The highest-earning chief executive -- at Central Manchester
Healthcare -- received #112,000 in 1993/94, a rise of 15.5%.
A further four trust chiefs were paid #90,000 or more.
The analysis of the accounts from 130 NHS trusts nationwide covering
the financial year ending March 31, also found enormous variations
around the average 6.6% rise -- ranging from cuts in pay of 4.1% to an
increase of 27.8%.
Shadow Health Secretary Margaret Beckett said: ''The pay and
conditions of people who deliver the services are being squeezed and the
pay and conditions of those at the very top are burgeoning way out of
expectation.
''No one is against people who have considerable responsibility being
fairly paid but what we are seeing here is the ethics of private
business being brought into what was a public service.''
The money could be used to employ thousands of extra nurses, Mrs
Beckett said on BBC Radio 4.
Christine Hancock, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
said: ''The big issue in this for nurses is fairness. Nurses cannot be
expected to accept a virtual pay freeze as signalled by the Chancellor
when they see pay rises of more than 6% for their chief executives.''

TWO climbers were flown to hospital by a rescue helicopter yesterday
after being swept down a Scottish mountain by an avalanche.
The incident follows a general warning of avalanche danger on
Scotland's mountains as freezing weather and gales were followed
yesterday by slightly milder conditions.
Both climbers survived the accident on 3000ft Meal a Chrasgaidh, 25
miles north west of Dingwall.
However, one is believed to have suffered severe spinal injuries. His
companion was only slightly injured.
RAF Kinloss and Dundonnel Mountain rescue teams, assisted by a Sea
King helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth and search and rescue dogs, headed
for the mountain near Ullapool in Wester Ross as darkness fell.
Early reports suggested that both men had been swept several hundred
feet down the mountain and were found by companions.
The helicopter flew them to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. No
condition report was available on the more seriously injured man last
night.
The Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) again warned
yesterday that there will be a ''considerable'' risk of avalanche today
because a thaw at all levels overnight will have produced a wet and
unstable snowpack.
Mr Blyth Wright, co-ordinator of the SAIS, advised climbers to keep to
ridges and buttresses, which are usually protected from avalanches.
He added: ''Climbers can go on to the mountains even in quite bad
condtions but they must make a careful route choice and should be
prepared to alter their route according to the conditions.''
* A man's body was discovered frozen in a block of ice. The man, aged
55 to 60, was found on the frozen Sussex Downs, near Brighton
racecourse, in a water course which had formed on an old track.
Water had frozen around the body, indicating he could have been there
from 24 to 72 hours. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances.
Meanwhile, a former headmaster had a lucky escape after spending
9[1/2] hours in a ditch in sub-zero temperatures when his van crashed.
Driver Gordon Hurst, 61, is in Pontefract General Infirmary Hospital,
West Yorkshire, recovering from hypothermia.

ISRAELI undercover forces shot dead four Palestinians in the West Bank
village of Beit Liqia yesterday.
The army said soldiers operating in the area near Ramallah were shot
at from a vehicle and one soldier was slightly wounded. The Israeli
force returned fire and killed all four Palestinians in the car.
At the scene four bodies covered with jackets lay in pools of blood
beside a white Subaru car riddled with bullet holes. Dozens of Israeli
soldiers in full-battle gear scoured the darkened village.
Israel Radio said the four dead were militants of George Habash's
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine which opposes the
Israel-PLO peace deal.
The incident appeared to be part of a increasingly tough campaign by
Israel against Palestinian militants opposed to peace talks.
The deaths brought to seven the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank this week.
On Monday, soldiers killed three Palestinians in two separate
incidents. In each case the army said Israeli troops were fired on first
by guerrillas.
Israel and the PLO signed an interim peace deal in September 1993 that
so far has resulted in Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank town of Jericho.
The violence and a growing controversy over expansion of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have strained relations
between the sides and complicated negotiations on implementing further
stages of the peace deal.
Israelis and Palestinians also exchanged gunshots yesterday at the
Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. As many as four
Palestinians, including two PLO police, were reported wounded.
Israel said the clashes were initiated by a PLO officer.

A FORMER assistant prison governor yesterday admitted taking bribes
from a prisoner as inducements to grant him parole. Trevor Phipps, 49,
who had worked at Leyhill Open Prison, near Bristol, was said to have
accepted air tickets to America, paid hotel accommodation for himself
and his wife and free accommodation with meals and theatre tickets in
London.
His lawyer said at Bristol Crown Court his guilty plea was not an
admission about the alleged trip to America. The prisoner, Benham
Nodjoumi, 49, admitted corruptly giving a bribe. The hearing was
adjourned for pre-sentence reports.

AN 82-year-old woman and her three-year-old great-grandson were in
hospital last night after being hurled off their feet when a kitchen
range blew apart in her cottage.
Mrs Jane Young, of East High Street, Greenlaw, Berwickshire, and the
boy, Michael Elliott, were thrown across the kitchen.
A senior fire officer described it as a ''mini-explosion''.
It happened soon after the range, which provided hot water from a
back-boiler, was re-lit for the first time in several days.
Both escaped serious injury, but were taken to Borders General
Hospital.
Mrs Young was treated for cuts and shock and was detained in a
''stable'' condition.
The boy, who received minor burns, was transferred to the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh where he was said to be ''quite
comfortable''.
The accident happened when Mrs Young returned to her own home after
bringing in the New Year with members of her family, including
grand-daughter Mrs Lisa Elliott, who is Michael's mother, and her
husband David.
Only Mrs Young and Michael were in the kitchen at the time.
The blast is thought to have been caused by a lack of water in the
boiler after the pipes froze while the cottage was empty.
Assistant Divisional Officer David Mercer, of Lothian and Borders fire
service, said: ''It was one of the old-fashioned types of cast-iron
kitchen range with a back-boiler and there was no water coming in.
''It should be a warning to people to check that the water is flowing
before they light these things after being away from home during
severely cold weather.''
He said there was no fire and no structural damage.
''There were no bits of metal flying about, thankfully,'' he said.

AS President Boris Yeltsin halted the bombing of Grozny his chief
spokesman said yesterday that he was ''deeply upset'' by criticism of
his deployment of the military in Chechnya.
''There is a huge wave of criticism of the president in the media.
This is to a great extent unjustified,'' Vyacheslav Kostikov told
independent NTV television. ''Boris Nikolayevich was not ready for such
a reception. I know that he is very deeply upset by this.''
In Washington, the State Department said that the United States has
urged Russia to ask the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in
Europe to help resolve the crisis.

THE governor of high-security Parkhurst jail was told prisoners had a
master key in their possession two days before three dangerous inmates
used it to make their escape, according to prison officers. They said
they told Mr John Marriott they believed prisoners had a copy of the
key, but he failed to take any action.
As this latest row emerged, to add to other recent security blunders
and riots, Home Secretary Michael Howard resisted calls for his
resignation. He pledged to quit ''without hesitation'' if policy
failures were found to be at fault, but said people should get away from
generalisations and find out exactly what went wrong.
In the latest incidents, two murderers and an arsonist, all serving
life sentences, escaped from Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight and rioting
flared for two nights running at Humberside's Everthorpe prison. These
followed the suicide of alleged serial killer Frederick West in his cell
at Winson Green Prison, Birmingham.
The Prison Service admitted its own inefficiency was to blame for the
escape from the jail regarded as Britain's Alcatraz because of its
island site and high-risk inmates.
News that a key was used added to the embarrassment of the service,
which promised to step up security at the prison after failure to
''follow basic security procedures''.
The three escapees had up to two hours or more to get away after
letting themselves out of a gymnasium, unlocking a workshop, and
assembling a ladder to scale a 25ft high wall.
As 200 police continued a land, sea and air search around the island,
fears grew that the men may have caught a ferry to the mainland,
confident that Parkhurst's ''very relaxed regime'' would give them time
before being reported missing.
Mr Neil Mason, spokesman for the Prison Officers Association at
Parkhurst, said: ''Most of the gates work off one key and somehow they
managed to get hold of a copy of the key. This should never, ever
happen.''
Mr Terry McLaren, a member of the national executive committee of the
POA, said: ''The governor of Parkhurst was informed two days before the
escape that there was a strong possibility there had been a compromise
of the keys.
''Officers picked up the intelligence that the prisoners may have
copies of keys and passed the information on. We found it extraordinary
that direct action was not taken.
''Now we are seeing a situation of changing the locks after the horse
has bolted.''
Police warned the public not to approach the violent and dangerous
escapees.
They are: Matthew Williams, 25, jailed for conspiracy to cause
explosions, arson, and administering poison; Keith Rose, 45, who shot
dead the wife of a supermarket tycoon during a bungled kidnap attempt;
and Andrew Rodger, 44, a Scot who beat a man to death.
The escapees had gone to the gymnasium where a fitness session started
at 6pm on Tuesday night, and had apparently slipped away using their key
to unlock a rear door, according to Mr Mason.
''They used the same key to open the gate to a building called the
vocational training workshop. It was an ingenious escape and obviously
very well planned.
''In the workshop they put together sections of metal which they had
made earlier and then hidden. The sections formed a ladder which was
long enough to get them over the wall.
''All the prisoners think it is hilarious and they have been really
taunting the officers about it this morning.''
Mr Mclaren said a dog handler who had patrolled the prison wall where
the three made their escape had been replaced by cameras four months
ago. ''It is ridiculous,'' he said. ''Prisoners are not frightened of
security cameras: they are frightened of dogs.''
In the other incident, two nights of rioting by about 200 prisoners at
Everthorpe jail, prisons Minister Michael Forsyth said the cause was a
clampdown on drugs and security procedures.
The Minister toured the Humberside prison near Hull as clearing up
operations were under way. He said: ''Talking to the prison officers,
and indeed some of the prisoners involved, it appears that in part it
has been a reaction to measures taken in the prison.''
He said, for example, prisoners objected to spyholes being uncovered
and they had rebelled against Governor Roy Smith's tougher line on
drugs.
Police said everything which could be broken was smashed: tables,
chairs, snooker tables, windows, doors, and cast iron staircases.
As opposition MPs stepped up their demands for Mr Howard and prison
service director-general Derek Lewis to go, the Home Secretary pledged a
full inquiry as part of a nationwide review of jail security led by
General Sir John Learmont, ordered after last month's damning report on
the IRA breakout from Whitemoor prison.
Under intense political pressure, Mr Howard yesterday broke a
three-day silence on the matter. He insisted overcrowding had not been a
factor in any of the incidents, but he went on: ''If my policies were
found to be responsible for any such event, or if I had failed to
implement anything I should have implemented, then of course I would
resign without hesitation.''
He denied passing the buck to Mr Lewis or trying to evade his ultimate
responsibility.
0 The admission from the Prison Service over its own inefficiency in
the escape came as it was disclosed that Judge Stephen Tumim, the
Inspector of Prisons, found defects in security when he visited
Parkhurst last year.
He inspected the jail after his investigation at Whitemoor Prison. He
told the BBC: ''I found serious security defects on a broad front. My
comments were passed to the Director General of Prisons who said
something would be done right away. I assume some action was taken but
it has not been effective.''
In a statement about the breakout, the Prison Service said: ''It is
likely that this could only have occurred because of a failure to follow
basic security procedures.''
Major building work to up-grade physical security at the prison was
currently under way but would not be completed until 1998.
Last night prison locks were being changed.
Mr Richard Tilt, the new director of security, was heading for the
prison to investigate the causes of the escape.
Mr Howard told ITN: ''We are absolutely determined to leave no stone
unturned in finding out what happened and to put it right.''
For Labour, Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said: ''Michael Howard
must now get a grip of his responsibilities. He must acknowledge that he
is the man responsible for the service and answerable for it. He must
stop passing the buck to Mr Lewis and start to follow the example of
some, at least, of his Ministerial colleagues.
''Mr Howard's job is now on the line.''
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman, said:
''Whatever goes on the two men at the top (Howard and Lewis) seem to be
unscathed. I do not think the public is going to allow that to
continue.''

MON Dieu! Sacre bleu! It didn't do much for entente cordiale when some
of Aberdeen's senior citizen ambassadors to their twin city of
Clermont-Ferrand called their hosts ''bloody Froggies.''
Although it appears that only Aberdonians heard that insult, the
behaviour of some of the party on the Aberdeen District
Council-subsidised trip was bad enough to prompt one of the party to
write to the hotel manager to apologise.
''Several members of our party were poor ambassadors for the City of
Aberdeen,'' Mrs Marjory Skinner wrote.
''Please do not think we are all so bad mannered and greedy. People
like this are found all over the world and, unfortunately, there
appeared to be too many in our party.''
The behaviour of the Aberdonians on the trip to ''widen horizons,
encourage international friendship and enhance the image of the city
overseas'' apparently included smuggling out food from the breakfast
buffet.
Mrs Skinner's name was drawn out of the hat for an ''unforgettable
holiday as ambassadors for Aberdeen'' which was ten-fold oversubscribed.
She thoroughly enjoyed her #260 11-day holiday but has highlighted
some of the ''hic-coughs'' in a letter to the council's international
committee to be considered next week as part of a report on the October
trip.
A sprightly 62-year-old who swims and plays tennis, and one of the
youngest in the 51-strong party, even Mrs Skinner found some of the
itinerary a little demanding.
They spent an afternoon in Clermont-Ferrand with fellow senior
citizens. Given that there were no interpreters and only Mrs Skinner and
one other could speak enough French to converse there was little
exchange of European ideas.
Mrs Skinner also found a three-hour walk around the old quarter
extremely tiring.
She does say in her letter that some aspects of the holiday were a
huge success but she was embarrassed at the behaviour of some
travellers.
''Frankly I was ashamed of the behaviour of some,'' she wrote. ''Why
they came on this type of holiday puzzles me. It does not help entente
cordiale when one said in a loud voice . . . 'these bloody Froggies.'
This was in the crowded foyer of the hotel.''
Aberdeen District's International Officer Ms Alison Cameron says in
her report that most of the English-speaking members of the city of
Clermont-Ferrand authorities were actually in Aberdeen at the time of
the trip for a French Week which explained the difficulty with
English-speaking couriers.
She also says there was evidence ''of a certain lack of adaptability
on the part of some participants.''
