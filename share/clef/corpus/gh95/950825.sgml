Ross Finlay goes by the Clyde Valley with a Peugeot 605.
AS a car to grab the headlines the Peugeot 605 in two-litre form does
not have much going for it. Despite a facelift at the start of this
year, its appearance offers no grand surprises. And since the same car
is also available in a fancy specification with three-litre V6 engine
and electronic suspension control, the base-model two-litre is not going
to set the heather on fire with its performance or technology. The
curious thing is that the #16,845 two-litre SLi which starts the range
is actually a very appealing car -- quiet, roomy and mature.
The 605 is one of those big French saloons whose modest level of sales
here makes you wonder if it can really be worth while going to all the
trouble of engineering a right-hand drive conversion. Of course, in
their home market the French manufacturers can hardly ignore the
executive sector, and the 605 has fair enough overall sales, beyond the
200,000 mark since it was introduced in 1990.
During my time with the 605, I used it to meet up with last Sunday's
RSAC Veteran, Vintage and Classic Car Run in the Clyde Valley. Even if
it is hardly in the same class for elegance as the Rolls-Royces, the
1912 De Dion Bouton or the beautifully turned-out 1937 MG SA Tickford,
among the many fine cars taking part, I thought it looked very much the
part of the gentleman's carriage. One thing it did have, denied to the
older cars, was a #900 extra-cost option in the form of
air-conditioning. In the sweltering weather, that was a much appreciated
feature, even if the system's typical habit of dreeping quietly
underneath when left parked for a while takes a little getting used to.
As part of Peugeot's carefully planned ''family look'', the 605
appears very like the smaller 405, and it may have been a subliminal
appreciation of that fact which made me, once or twice, drive it as if
it actually were a 405. That is, I sometimes started off on a
three-point turn which turned out to need more twizzles than that, and I
have to admit to the odd kerb being nicked by the nearside rear tyre at
left turns in towns.
The 605's proper place in the executive class is shown by the
remarkable amount of passenger room it offers. Setting the front seat
just as I like it, well reclined, I could not, with fingers spread out
behind me, touch both the back of the driver's seat and the front of the
back seat, which is a very unusual thing indeed. There is really good
lounging room in the rear, as well as a generous luggage boot.
There is evidence that this is a car designed in the 1980s in the look
of the cloth-trimmed interior, which has some more angular touches than
you see in newer designs. Equipment levels are fair on the SLi, although
it is obviously the more expensive cars in the range which score best
here.
A smallish -- for the overall size of the car -- but quite perky
135bhp engine takes this 605 to 60mph in just under 11 seconds, provides
leisured mid-range performance unless you rev it hard, and offers
big-car fuel consumption returns like 43mpg at 56mph, 35 at 75 and 24mpg
around town. While a slightly under-engined executive saloon is often
the recipe for strained behaviour on the road, the SLi has really low
levels of mechanical, wind and road-surface noise.
As well as that, the French engineers have pulled off their usual
trick with the non-electronic suspension. The two-litre is well balanced
on corners, and the ride quality is top class. No explosive performance,
then, but a smooth, quiet, roomy and comfortable saloon with fine road
manners and discreetly stylish lines.

HE promises that it will not change the world. Actually he's quite
right. But going against the trend of recent years, director/writer
James Bachman has let the Footlights Revue be funny again.
Combining a guest appearance from Jesus H Christ with English lessons
and a series of film shorts, the team presented a profile of the seven
deadly sins. But there was most audience sympathy for their take off of
Take That -- guilt perhaps.
Though the two (token?) females were a little disappointing, Matthew
Holness and Robert Webb's performances in particular held hints that the
Footlights may be starting to springboard some decent comic talent once
again. Like in the good old days, right?

Bonn, Thursday,
GERMAN Social Democrat women politicians want a new law to achieve
what decades of feminism have failed to do -- get men to do their share
of the washing and ironing.
''It's not fair that women do 35 hours of work a week in the
household, but men only 19.5 hours,'' SPD sex equality spokeswoman Ulla
Schmidt told the daily mass-circulation paper Bild.
''That's why the law on families needs to make it clearer that men
have to do their share of the cleaning, ironing, washing-up, and taking
care of the children.''
SPD MP Jella Teuchner said she would help to try to change the law.
''It should be automatic in a good partnership that a man and a woman
share the housework, but unfortunately the reality isn't usually like
that.''
Schmidt suggested that a formulation could be taken over from East
German law (almost entirely discarded in German unification) which said:
''Both spouses do their share in caring for and educating the children
and in running the household.''
But she did not go on to say if East German men had been any more
co-operative about helping their wives and partners than men in the
west.--Reuter.

THE Herald revealed last September that the Government's target date
for a privatised West Coast train operating company would be put back
''if the market response was low''.
It was a clear acknowledgement that investors were reluctant to come
forward because of the massive private sector input required to
modernise the line.
However, Transport Minister John Watts yesterday denied Labour claims
that the sale has been dropped because the #1 billion needed for
upgrading has proved difficult to raise.
He confirmed investment was needed, but insisted the two issues were
not linked.
A Department of Transport spokesman said Opraf had always made it
clear that the West Coast franchise was closely linked with the
upgrading, but added: ''It is not true that Railtrack has failed to
raise #1 billion -- they haven't even attempted to raise #1 billion.''
Last night, the failure to attract potential bidders had rail industry
experts declaring that a coach and horse was being driven through
Government privatisation targets.
It also comes within weeks of Scottish Chambers of Commerce declaring
the private sector would be able to fund and operate many rail
upgradings.
* The fastest InterCity West Coast journey time from Glasgow to London
Euston is four hours, 59 minutes.
InterCity East Coast's quickest train, from Edinburgh to London King's
Cross, is four hours, 10 minutes.
With typical West Coast times of five hours, 15 minutes it is possible
to travel from Glasgow and link with certain Edinburgh trains and still
arrive in London faster.
InterCity West coast runs seven trains -- each way -- on
Monday-Fridays; East Coast has 17 trains running, each way, on the same
days.
Both charge identical main fares, and InterCity East Coast makes no
extra charge to passengers from Glasgow boarding its trains in
Edinburgh.
The cheapest return fare -- at #34 -- is Superapex, which must be
booked at least 14 days in advance. It is available on selected trains
and capacity controlled.
Other typical fares are:
#46 -- Apex; #60 -- Superadvance; #60 -- Supersaver; #72 -- Saver; #82
-- Apex First; #95 -- Leisure First. Both train operators have First
Class and Standard Class return fares -- at about #190 and #130
respectively.

GREG Norman, the two-time Open champion, was involved in a heated
rules controversy during the opening round at the World Series of golf
in Akron, Ohio, yesterday.
He stormed out of Firestone Country Club after his round and was
planning to quit the tournament until US Tour commissioner Tim Finchem
talked him out of it.
Norman had been upset by an incident on the seventh green, where he
accused Mark McCumber, with whom he was playing, of tapping down a spike
mark, which is against the rules. McCumber denied doing so, saying he
was trying to pick up an insect on his line.
Norman discussed the incident with rules official Mike Shea, but as it
was one player's word against another's, McCumber was given the benefit
of the doubt. Norman, reportedly, was furious and refused to sign
McCumber's scorecard, leaving Shea to sign it. The Australian left the
course in a hurry.
McCumber shot a two-under-par 68, two off the pace, while Norman
carded a 73.
Due to the small 47-man field, the pairings were redone for the second
round, so Norman will not be playing with McCumber today.

<HEADLINE>RANGERS' MANAGER DETERMINED TO REMAIN A LEADER IN THE IBROX CHAMPIONS' LEAGUE. I'll be here for a while yet, says relaxed Smith</HEADLINE>

'The frustrations
and pressures can
be severe, but I
enjoy this job and I
intend to continue
doing so for a good number of years.'
THE madness and the pressures which had grown to almost crushing
severity had subsided, and Walter Smith was left alone in his office at
the top of the Ibrox staircase -- still intact despite the traumas of
another Champions' League qualifying tie, and still manager of the small
empire known as Rangers.
Indeed, Smith said last night that he intends to occupy the manager's
office for some considerable time.
He knows the delightful prospect of Champions' League football for the
second time in his term as manager will silence the whispers which
transmitted questions about his ability to cope, but more importantly,
he is relishing the challenge of mixing it again with Europe's best
coaches.
''What does the Champions League mean to me personally?'' Smith
repeated the question, and then straightened up in his chair allowing a
few seconds of silence to stretch like an eternity. He wanted his reply
to have the desired effect.
''Everything,'' he said eventually in a steady and measured tone.
''The Champions' League means everything to me, and it gives a club
something special. Even the morning after they had qualified, I could
sense the players' excitement about being in the competition again.''
He was talking about more than money, of course, because playing
against the best helps bring out qualities in others, as Rangers
discovered three seasons ago when they stood on the threshold of the
Champions' Cup final itself.
A dramatic improvement will be required if Rangers are to go so close
this season, but at least the 1-0 aggregate win over Anorthosis
Famagusta has eased considerable pressures on manager and players alike.
They can breathe again now that the debilitating fear of failure which
could have brought change at Ibrox has been dispersed. The unfurling of
the premier-division championship flag at Ibrox tomorrow will be
celebrated in raucous style.
Smith was aware there would have been loud demands for his resignation
if failure had called for a third successive year, and David Murray
would have been under pressure to act. But now Smith can afford to
relax, which is more than the managers of five other clubs who were in
the second-seeded group of eight along with Rangers, can do. Only his
side, Panathinaikos, and Grasshoppers Zurich managed to overcome
so-called inferior opposition.
IFK Gothenburg, for instance -- the team which destroyed Manchester
United in a Champions' League match last season -- failed to qualify and
Smith said: ''It isn't easy. We had to live for six weeks with the
thought of two legs of the preliminary tie, and our entire pre-season
was geared to getting through. The tension was great at times.
''The frustrating part is that it is our work here which allows the
fans to set their sights so high, but I accept that while they don't
expect us to do it every year, it might have been stretching it a bit
much to go three years without playing in the Champions' League.''
However, he pointed out that chairman Murray had never sat him down
and gone over the possible consequences had the club's Doomsday Scenario
been visited upon them again. But it is not necessary for anyone to tell
Smith what Rangers need.
''I have been here nine years and I know what we need. I also realise
I am not going to win in terms of pleasing everybody or meeting all
expectations,'' he said.
''Fortunately, the chairman doesn't burden me with financial aspects
of the club and that way, I can always try to do or ask for what I
consider to be the best for the club. But sometimes the people who
criticise don't bother to ask why I may have made a particular decision,
not that it bothers me especially.''
He is happy to be judged on his record, and he remains unperturbed
even when it is suggested some of the signings Rangers have made were
the work of Murray and not the manager. It is an allegation he dismisses
wearily.
''The chairman has asked on many occasions what might happen if he
were to bring in a player and then find the team were not successful. He
would be giving his manager an excuse for failure,'' Smith explained
although he acknowledged that chairmen must be involved in financial
details of big-money transfers.
''I am going into my fifth season here as manager, and every player
who has come to Ibrox during that time, and even before, when Graeme
Souness was in charge, has been as a result of a decision taken by the
men in charge of the teams.''
Smith disguises well the burdens which inevitably come to rest on the
shoulders of anyone managing one of the top clubs in Britain --
Manchester United's Alex Ferguson is another of those who become victims
of their own successes -- and it was typical that he should describe the
trauma of pre-qualifying thus: ''The other night was not one of those
times when the job is enjoyable. No, I couldn't honestly say that was a
pleasant experience, but now we may be able to relax. If a football club
can't relax, it can't play properly.
''However, we are over that difficult part. There is much we can look
forward to. The frustrations and pressures can be severe, but I enjoy
this job and I intend to continue doing so for a good number of years
yet.''
Of course everything will depend on results and on his work in the
transfer market, which is another source of worry because of the vast
amounts Rangers pay out. ''And remember, it isn't just the fee itself.
These contracts have to be serviced,'' Smith said, ''but a club like
ours needs the quality only big money can bring in, and you can't balk
at spending huge sums.
''However, I do worry when that kind of money is being spent, but so
far I have been let down by only one player.''
He wouldn't say, but it can be taken for granted that the player was
Basile Boli, who has come and gone from Ibrox in a short space of time.
You win some, and you lose some.
Smith has emerged from a difficult period which could have had a
profoundly adverse effect on his career, but there he was yesterday,
addressing the press just like always, and looking ahead. He will work
on knowing that whatever he does, it will be scrutinised and he will be
judged. But that's the downside of success.
People always demand more.

TENNENTS, the new sponsors of Scottish domestic rugby, yesterday
unveiled their plans for the season at a presentation at Murrayfield
attended by senior SRU officials and representatives from most of the
102 clubs who will compete in the championship.
The three-year sponsorship deal, reckoned to be worth around #1m, will
mean #2000 for every club participating in the premiership and national
league plus handsome cash awards for every team in the SRU Tennents 1556
Cup, Shield, and Bowl competitions.
The cup winners will receive #15,000, the shield victors #2500, and
the bowl winners #1500. All three finals will be played at Murrayfield
on Saturday, May 11.
Tennents sponsorship manager Scott Menneer said yesterday that the
brewers -- who have a proven track record in the field of sport and
music sponsorship -- would seek to make finals day at Murrayfield a
''festival of rugby.''

THERE are still those around who will be pessimistic about the
ambitions Rangers will take with them into the Champions' League next
month, probably the same people who had written off the Ibrox men before
their match in Cyprus.
However, when the draw is made today for Europe's most prestigious
club competition, the Ibrox players and manager Walter Smith fear no
one.
Indeed, yesterday, Smith agreed with those of his players who had
maintained before the game against Anorthosis that the preliminary round
was always liable to be more difficult than the group games which lay
ahead as a reward.
Said Smith: ''The opposition is obviously of a higher level when you
go into the Champions' League and all of us know that, but the pressures
are less.
''In the league situation, you find that clubs are more inclined to
attack whether they are at home or away.
''We tasted this before three years ago, and we enjoyed it then. I
think it will be the same this time. I don't care who we are drawn with
in the group.''
Smith also believes that he has a squad potentially powerful enough to
threaten the glamorous names who will go into the draw in Geneva today.
''What we have is a squad of players who can do as well for us as the
squad did three years ago,'' he admitted. ''But we still do not have the
team unit which we had when we went into the Champions' League for the
first time.
0
''Now we have to allow the lads who have joined us over the summer a
little time to adjust. It is a matter of games.''
Smith would always be the last man to make excuses and he avoided
reference in his post mortem to the absence of the influential Brian
Laudrup and the early exit of Paul Gascoigne in Cyprus.
#6m of creative talent was missing, and yet Rangers still went
through, and there indications that Gordan Petric will slot in
comfortably at the back in the Rangers' manager's preferred formation.
And while the biggest names of all may have been missing, local hero
Charlie Miller confirmed everything that has been forecast for him from
the Ibrox back-room staff. He grasped the opportunity in Cyprus to
demonstrate that he has the talent to match anyone at the club.
The emergence of Miller emphasises the strength-in-depth Rangers have
at their disposal. Once again, Smith maintained that his priority each
season is to try to win the title. To do so, he needs a pool of players
who will be able to operate on all fronts -- at home and in Europe for
Rangers, and at international level too.
But while the premier division must always be in his sights, Smith
also recognises that the money which can be made in Europe is essential
to the continued growth of Rangers as a club.
It will not be good news for those who wish to compete with the Ibrox
side that they now will be several million pounds richer before
Christmas arrives thanks to the massive sponsorship, the television
fees, and the sell-out gates.
On a personal level, Smith would like to see an end to the preliminary
round games which saw only three of the eight seeded sides go through --
Rangers, Grasshoppers of Zurich, and the Greek side Panathanaikos.
Smith said: ''I honestly believe it would be better if all 24 teams
who are in the European Cup go into a League situation right away. It
would be fairer and it would remove the tensions which surround these
opening games.''
If that were to happen, then the move towards a European Super League
would be one step closer, and that is where Rangers' real ambitions must
lie.

IAN BROADLEY assesses Rangers' possible opponents.
IS THERE life after Baggio? How Juventus cope without their
inspirational attacker, now with AC Milan, will answer whether the
Italian champions can justify their favourites' status for Europe's
ultimate prize.
The Turin club, which no longer enjoys the backing of Fiat,
nevertheless were able to speculate #10m on acquiring the Sampdoria trio
of Attilio Lombardo, Pietro Vierchowod, and Vladimir Jugovic.
Lombardo will miss the early rounds of the Champions' League with a
broken leg sustained in a pre-season game, so Juve may have to wait for
a return on their investment.
Still, they will represent one of the two main threats to the
ambitions of a Rangers side rated at 10-1 to go all the way.
The other most certainly is defending champions Ajax. While Frank
Rijkaard has retired and Clarence Seedorf has taken Internazionale's
millions, there is abounding confidence within the Amsterdam club that
they can retain the title.
The UEFA Cup holders, Borussia Dortmund, have invested as much as
Rangers in the transfer market. Their latest capture is the defender,
Jurgen Kohler, the last German star to leave Italy. However, they no
longer have the Dane Flemming Polvsen, who has been forced to retire
prematurely through injury.
With others of the quality of sweeper Matthias Sammer, midfielder
Andreas Moller, and striker Karl-Heinz Riedle, there is a definite
chance of adding to their European honours.
The financial restrictions imposed on Real Madrid to reduce their
massive debts may ultimately curb their progress.
Former holders Steaua Bucharest are back once more along with the
stolid Russians, Dynamo Kiev, who disposed of Aalborg without difficulty
in the preliminary round.
Ferencvaros ousted Anderlecht to hint at a return to their golden era,
must pose a threat. But can Blackburn Rovers do the same under new
management?

* IT was a bit of a bummer for poor Von Meder. A man with an entire
career structure built on being a President Kennedy soundalike. And
suddenly his act was posthumous. Problems quite like that they haven't
got, agree US and UK stand-up stars Will Durst and Simon Fanshawe. But
both men also earn a living baiting the political classes, and both are
now faced with a similar dilemma.
Durst describes himself to me as a yellow dog Democrat. ''Which means
if they put up a yellow dog as the Democratic candidate against any
Republican, the dog gets my vote.'' And now his favoured candidate has
made it to the White House he has to figure out how to deal with that in
an act where no politician normally gets given anything resembling a
quarter.
Meanwhile Fanshawe, self-confessed and loudly proclaimed Blairite, has
been figuring out how to attack the people's party without drawing
unacceptable levels of blood. For Fanshawe the equation became
relatively simple after he decided that Blair's left-wing critics were
as fair game as the rightwards variety.
Durst admits to life getting a lot easier last November when the
Republicans won control of both Congress and the Senate. ''It may have
been a bad night for the American people but at last I had something to
rail against again. And Newt Gingrich has been a gift. Loud, brash, and
gaining the highest disapproval ratings since polling began.
''He's good for business in my line of work.''
Arguably Durst has been the luckier -- eight years of Reagan, then
little Ross Perot as an extra helping of manna from the humour heavens.
Fanshawe, more of a political activist, says that all 12 years of
Thatcher jokes tell a comic is that if he wants to make a difference to
the system he might as well hand out leaflets on street corners.
And what, if anything, becomes off limits? Durst says he got criticism
for attacks on Reagan's stupidity because people thought he was
bad-mouthing Alzheimer sufferers. But how can you not question how a guy
living on a different planet gets to be a two-term President? And what
if, I ask our Simon, just for the sake of idle argument, a senior member
of the Cabinet was found to be gay? What would a right-on gay rights
campaigner, such as his good self, make of that on stage?
''I'd say I wanted to embrace him, to share welfare benefits with him,
have his puppies.'' Mmmmm.
* THE Kirov were coming. And the Festival staff were not fazed. Kirov
may have more of everything, including prima donnas and a 275- strong
cast list, but we are talking a well-oiled Festival machine here, primed
to anticipate any crisis and every little thespian whim. Except one.
Nobody figured that they would need or run out of eyelash glue. And
nobody, not even the highest class of interpreter, could figure out how
to ask for it, never mind where to find it. But lo, it was found. And
the cast fluttered afresh. And presumably not a dry eye in the house.
* AS those of us who remember the Traverse Theatre in previous
incarnations will testify, the female loos in the current establishment
are a very considerable improvement on the former more primitive
arrangements.
But I have to report a current flaw in the facilities. There is a
condom machine.
And on the front of it someone has thoughtfully appended a couple of
stickers advertising a 24-hour breakdown service. Purely in the public
interest I rang the number concerned. It is in Dundee. It belongs to a
man calling himself Alan Jones. And several calls later I can still only
raise an answering machine.
Whereas I deduce any condom user with a 3am crisis would probably
appreciate a more immediate, not to say adjacent, source of repair.
* IT is late in the afternoon of the great pipe band saga. Thousands
of skirlers have made their way down the Royal Mile. And by this hour
Festival press officer Morag Burnett, whose open window is in the same
vicinity, is thinking that if she ever hears another drone it will be
far too soon.
But hark. It is a lone piper. And is he not playing the Symphony from
the New World? And is not Dvorak this year's featured composer? See
Embra bagpipers.
Awfy cultured.
* IT has been the week of the big breakfast. Or the little breakfast
with big ambitions, the fourth early-morning Funding For The Arts
seminar organised by prospective Tory candidate and professional
lobbyist Struan Stevenson.
This year it comes up trumps. It is able to answer the one question
being hotly debated in the creative community all over Scotland. Does
new Arts Minister Lord Lindsay really look like Robert Redford? The jury
is still out. But female delegates were unanimous that the latest blond
bombshell in New St Andrews House would not be turned away on a dark
night.
* PETER SELLARS may have left town, but his influence lingers on. One
shop in Chambers Street now proudly sports a new sales poster: I Looked
In the Window, And Then I Saw The Books.

Atlantic City,
THE long wait is almost over for Glasgow's Gary Jacobs, and the former
undefeated welterweight champion of Europe is in the best shape of his
life for his biggest challenge, a 12-round contest against America's
Pernell Whitaker for the championship of the world in Atlantic City
tomorrow night.
The hard training has been done and all that remains is the waiting
until what Gary says is ''my date with destiny.''
The last time I spoke with 31-year-old Pernell ''Sweet Pea'' Whitaker,
regarded by many as the world's best pound-for-pound boxer, he told me:
''I love going 12 rounds. I don't go in there to knock anybody out. I
know I'm a good puncher, but punchers don't win fights. Smart fighters
win fights.
''I go in there to be an artist and to use various ways to win. I am a
master of the sport.''
Nobody can deny that last part, because the man who holds the WBC
version of the welter title has also won world titles at three other
weights. And he does take a real pride in his work, preferring to outwit
and confuse an opponent over the full distance.
When I next speak with the champion today, I will be able to assure
him that tomorrow night he will face a man who is equally prepared and
equipped to go the 12 rounds and who believes his destiny is to become
champion of the world.
''I took a few days to get acclimatised,'' said the Scot. ''But I soon
settled down and have thoroughly enjoyed working here. The sparring has
been great and I have never been fitter. In fact, I'm jumping out of my
skin.''
His manager Mickey Duff, who has been associated with former world
champions such as John Conteh, John H Stracey, Charlie Magri, Jim Watt,
Maurice Hope, and Lloyd Honeyghan said: ''Of all the fighters I have
been involved with, I have never seen anybody train like Gary. He is in
unbelievable condition.''
Whitaker said: ''Scotland should be proud of Gary Jacobs. He deserves
this chance of winning a world title, because he has worked his way into
the No.1 contender's position. But I don't see him winning.
''Every fight is a personal challenge for me. Everybody is always
looking for the one person to test Pernell Whitaker's chin. But I know
I'm the best defensive fighter in the world.''
Jacobs is an 8-1 underdog and the American camp are dismissing his
chances and looking beyond this contest, with Whitaker already being
lined up to fight the great Julio Cesar Chavez again.

IT'S a fair bet that the cast of Odds On Theatre Company will have
lost a pound or two by the end of the festival -- and I'm not talking
cash. In the sweaty confines of the Pleasance Attic, my most despised
fringe venue, their lavish costumes have them sweltering away.
So, their spirited performances are all the more commendable,
particularly Andy Mackay as the central character Alexei, who, on the
night I caught the show, was bravely battling against a chesty fever but
was still managing to exude great dynamism and charm.
Stephen Sharkey's adaptation of the Dostoevsky short story is a
colourful romp, although it flags quite seriosuly towards the end.
However, he does effectively convey the glamour and the passion of the
gaming tables. Tantalising stuff.

NOTHING foggy about this, it's crisp, clear comedy from the highly
accomplished Rejects Revenge, who seem to specialise in spoofs on
English buffoonery.
This is a densely-plotted silly tale about a cursed pearl stolen from
an Egyptian tomb which satirises the conventions of courtroom dramas,
lampoons Victorian detective mysteries and manages to replicate the
stunts of adventure yarns in the Indianna Jones vein -- some very
inventive miming has you convinced that the cast are crawling along the
top of a train, ducking for tunnels. The ever-twisting plot even manages
to make it to the Wild West at one stage. Too many puns for my liking
but rollicking good fun and exuberant peformances.

I REALLY want to describe this as ''grown-up dance''. It knows what
it's doing, but it still likes to take risks. It has poise, knows the
difference between silly-refreshing and silly-plain-boring, and above
all, it understands music. You can sit back and watch without feeling
anxious or embarrassed. ''Accomplished'' isn't the half of it.
The man behind the dance is Mark Baldwin. Excuse me while I holler
with delight -- he's just been appointed choreographer-in-residence with
Scottish Ballet. This programme -- performed by some of the finest
dancers in this country -- is a taster of his talents. Vespers (to
Monteverdi) is a new work that exemplifies his superb musicality, his
eye for telling detail and his elegant control over structure and line.
All this, and a sense of humour . . .
Truly excellent, both in content and performance.

AMERICANS are famed for unloading their life stories within minutes of
meeting, and Jim Salestrom is no exception. He talks about his brothers,
his wife and children (who arrive later and chat, mid-song, about their
day), his author friends, and their home environs in Colorado complete
with seasonal weather statistics.
Oh, and between chatting, he also sings, in a pleasant, slightly John
Denverish style. He has played with Denver. In fact, that might even be
Denver backing Salestrom's guitar on the karaoke-like backing tape
(which gets very silly during a phantom piano solo). The songs,
likewise, are pleasant, praising Colorado's special pine trees and the
Shores of Edinburgh (eh?) until John Prine's mirthful Let's Talk Dirty
in Hawaiian allows a pent-up giggle to escape.

WILL Carling and his England squad negotiators have reached agreement
with Twickenham officials for a new promotional deal that will bring
each player #40,000 next season.
The Rugby Football Union cannot yet announce the full sum available to
the squad, nor the sponsor, but RFU secretary Tony Hallett said in a
statement: ''An urgent review of the competitive structure is expressly
sought by the players and this on-going discussion will be undertaken
through the RFU with the Five Nations, the National Clubs Association,
and other interested parties.''
Meanwhile, world officials gathered behind closed doors in a Paris
hotel yesterday for a crucial meeting of the International Board
expected to end amateurism in the sport.
Twenty delegates, two from each of the eight leading rugby union
nations and one each from Argentina, Canada, Italy and Japan, started
their talks in an atmosphere of secrecy.
Hotel staff were asked to keep the media away and IB press officers
insisted that no information would leak before a news conference on
Sunday. A spokeswoman said that even the agenda of the meeting,
scheduled to last until tomorrow, was ''private and secret''.
Scottish Rugby Union chief executive Bill Hogg said yesterday that the
general committee of the Union would meet on Sunday night once IB
representives Freddie McLeod and Allan Hosie had returned from Paris.
''This is such an important issue that it was felt better to report to
the Union before any comments were made to the media by our
representatives. We will make clear our position, in light of whatever
the IB decides, at a news conference at Murrayfield on Monday.''
Irrespective of what the IB decides in Paris, the SRU, alone of the
Home Unions, has already announced that it is ready to embrace
professionalism, place its international players under contract, and pay
them through a trust fund.
McLeod told The Herald last week that it was crucial that the Board
come up with concrete proposals to end the amateurism sham and that if
it did not, then its very future would be in doubt.
* DODDIE Weir, Melrose's Scotland international forward, will miss
almost half of his club's premier first-division league programme
because of a leg operation. A calcium growth has had to be removed from
a bone.
''He could be out for about six weeks,'' Stuart Henderson, the Melrose
secretary, explained yesterday. By the time Weir is fit, Melrose would
have played at least six of their 14 league matches.

GENIAL John quietly mourns the loss of his youthful radicalism at the
same time as he celebrates the intestinal gaseous with which men are
sometimes blessed. He has a neat line in laddish absurdism and a
disarming propensity for slow stares into the ether.
He idly wonders whether the ALF will ever truly usurp the IRA as a
hate-object in British hearts and minds. He plays James Brown's Sex
Machine on the bodhran, gets a bit angry on the accordion, and
impersonates Billy Bragg on guitar. John never imposes narrative
cohesion on any of these thoughts and activities, but that doesn't stop
him being very funny.

INVESTIGATIONS by the Jockey Club have been completed into allegations
that two racehorses owned in Scotland ran in ''flapping'' races at
unlicensed tracks in the Borders, it was confirmed yesterday.
It had been claimed that Pretty Average, a 20-1 winner at Thirsk on
July 29, had won three times at flapping meetings under the name of
Short and Sweet.
The inquiry by security officers of the Jockey Club also covered
allegations that Blue Faulds, which raced over hurdles last season, had
been successful at Hawick in a flapping race as Hotspur.
Patricia Hamilton, of Ashgill, Larkhall, the registered owner of
Pretty Average, has been interviewed as has her friend, Jim McDonald,
said to be connected with both horses. Basil Richmond, the trainer of
Pretty Average, and Fergus Jestin, the permit-holder who ran Blue
Faulds, have been interviewed and investigators have had an opportunity
to see both horses. If the allegations are proved correct the
connections of both could be warned off.

AFTER a three-year absence from the stage, the spiky satirical
socialist returns with a practical, witty demonstration of how the Tory
Government's water-privatisation policy has turned a life-giving
essential into a stock-market commodity. Simon's informative, too. Did
you know 40% of the world has no access to clean water, and that global
demand for the stuff doubles every 21 years?
His binary theory of party-politics is an interesting one as well, a
deft lampoon of leaders who insist that every problem only has two
solutions, ours (which is right) and theirs (which is wrong). Aye, you
don't have to be a Simon Fanshawe fan to acknowledge that Simon sure is
sharp.

YOU can't blame South Africa's Market Theatre Company for wanting to
make a switch from the kind of political theatre with which it made its
name in the days of apartheid. Changed times need changed responses. And
if a new political climate has freed it up to go in other theatrical
directions, then so be it.
But you surely can blame the company for producing such a thin piece
of work as Take the Floor, written by Susan Pam-Grant and DJ Grant
presumably on a rainy afternoon.
It's a Strictly Ballroom with geeks, lonely-hearts with two left feet
who seek solace and company on the dance floor. It's worth no more than
a five-minute sketch and, trying to get by for 90 minutes on charm
alone, its coy appeal proves far too fragile.

DILLIE Keane, Adele Anderson and Marilyn Cutts -- collectively known
as Fascinating Aida -- are so good at what they do that it's quite
irritating. Their specialisms are satirical but poignant songs on themes
relating to the plight of the 90s woman. But the satire isn't as sharp
as it probably once was, and what it does all sound, in fact, is rather
jolly.
Maybe that's why the show went down so well with a middle-aged,
middle-class audience: it's all quite safe, but in a daring kind of a
way. You don't get many Morningside amateur singing groups admitting to,
let alone performing, the Herpes Tango.
The best items on the FA bill were the less obviously funny:
Anderson's bluesy torch song, Jealousy, and Cutts' resigned,
matter-of-fact Let's Go to a Hotel.

WEST Indies' spearhead Curtly Ambrose, refreshed after resting from
the fifth Test, returned to haunt England's batsmen, striking a double
blow in the final session at The Oval yesterday.
With England's innings progressing satisfactorily on 192 for three,
the tall Antiguan removed Graham Thorpe and the debutant Alan Wells with
successive deliveries.
It was a jolt from which England will do well to recover in this
innings, particularly as Thorpe, who had delighted a capacity first day
crowd on his home ground, had done much to revive England's innings with
his invaluable 74 from 177 balls.
The unfortunate Wells, in only his first match, after a long wait on
the verge of Test cricket, went first ball. It wasn't an easy ball to
play, as it rose from just short of a length and Wells could only play
it into the hands of Sherwin Campbell at short square leg.
Earlier, umpire Ramaswamy had spoken to Courtney Walsh and his captain
with regard to intimidatory bowling. Walsh clearly seemed upset as he
appeared to grab his sun hat from the umpire at the end of the over.
However, no official complaint was made to the international match
referee.
It took England's third wicket partnership of 89 between John Crawley
and Thorpe to check the early initiative that the tourists had seized in
the morning session after England chose to bat.
Their immediate task was to hold the innings together, after the loss
of both opening batsmen with 60 on the board, and then to rebuild a
respectable total.
It had seemed to be shaping well until Atherton departed shortly
before lunch. Crawley laboured hard for his runs, but Thorpe was
certainly more fluent.
The West Indies, having made two changes in the team from Nottingham
-- Ambrose replacing the leg-spinner Dhanraj, and Carl Hooper returning
for Keith Arthurton -- grabbed the first England wicket in only the
third over when Jason Gallian edged to first slip where Hooper took the
catch despite being distracted by a diving wicket keeper.
Gallian was one of three changes in the England side, the other two
being Wells and fast bowler Devon Malcolm.
Atherton, after having been given a life on 11, looked as solid as
ever, until the Windies struck a psychological blow, dismissing the
England captain just two overs before lunch. It was a similar dismissal
to that of Gallian, but off a thicker edge.
Crawley crawled to his third Test 50 in just under four hours before
being caught at extra cover from the first ball he received after tea.
England were 149 for three, and then Ambrose returned to the attack so
effectively to reduce England further. Scoreboard:

STAND-UPS Alan Francis and Mike Hayley have crafted themselves a
symmetrical two-hander with a serial-killer theme and a heap of
Brit-farce dramatic staples. Identical twin-brothers; mistaken
identities; unanswered messages on answering-machines. Plus a talking
parrot which says the wrong thing at the wrong time, only for this to
transpire -- if you're still with me -- to be the right time.
Coincidences and outlandish plot-twists abound, and while the ropey
dramatic canon established by Brian Rix should justly be derided,
Jeffrey Dahmer's two Fringe henchmen get away it with by virtue of their
energetic likeability.

A WORLD premiere, an orchestral oddity, a concert hall rarity, and a
concerto for trombone by Rimsky-Korsakov -- wild programming by any
standard but this was for Bedfordshire's second Youth Orchestra, average
age between 11 and 15.
Amazingly they coped. The premiere, Night Dance by Russell Keable, had
all round secure playing with something for everyone to do, the timbre
of the work out of the Ealing Studios school. Soloist Nick Allen then
bounced through that Trombone Concerto with a frothy rum-ti-tum, to be
followed by a rather uneven Philadelphia Symphony.
It was second-half conductor Michael Rose though who produced the big
sparkle in a thoroughly atmospheric Night on the Bear Mountain, trumped
by a humorous and exhilarating account of the eccentrically named
Symphony 5[1/2] by Don Gillis. Wonderful stuff.

ABERDEEN, famous for its Britain in Bloom successes, was treated to a
different Flower yesterday when Zimbabwe Test skipper Andy Flower
brightened up a rain-affected day with a brilliant batting display.
His brisk 69 allowed MCC skipper Paul Parker to make a challenging
declaration after four hours had been lost to the weather.
Flower stroked six boundaries and two towering 6s, the first of them a
mighty blow over extra cover off Greig Williamson. The Clydesdale bowler
retreated to the safety of the pavilion shortly afterwards, but not
before he enjoyed one moment of success when he sent Tony Hobson's
stumps tumbling.
Scotland struck again through Stuart Kennedy, who had Carl Rogers
caught behind for a duck.
Flower's knock was eventually brought to an end when he top-edged
Keith Sheridan to Dougie Lockhart. It was the second time the Poloc
left-arm spinner had claimed the Test star's scalp, following on a
similar success on Scotland's pre-season tour of Zimbabwe last year.
Parker's declaration, with MCC still 148 runs adrift, left openers
Iain Philip and Neil MacRae an awkward four-over spell to negotiate
before the close.
Philip must now decide what will make a sporting game of it today.
Scoreboard:
Scotland 281 and 11 for no wicket, MCC 133 for three decl (A Flower
69, T Hobson 28). Scotland lead by 159 runs.

cancellation for safety reasons. Two bomb attacks in a month, thought to
be by Algerian Muslims, have killed seven people in central Paris.
Planet Hollywood shareholders including Sylvester Stallone, Arnold

inauguration on September 3. Whoopi Goldberg, Cindy Crawford, and Gerard

SCOTLAND'S Dale Reid can take advantage of absentee Laura Davies and
reclaim her Tour record in the 54 holes Ford Stimoral Danish Open, which
begins today at Vejle.
Two weeks ago at St Pierre Davies equalled Reid's Tour record of 21
victories but, with Davies in Quebec for this week's du Maurier Classic,
Reid can take her first title since 1991.
With most of the leading players in Canada, Reid is the only member of
the last European Solheim Cup side in the field of 88.
It is a good week also for Myra McKinlay the former Curtis Cup player
from Scotland. Currently ninety-fourth in the table, McKinlay's
immediate aim is to climb into the leading 80 who will avoid having to
attend the Tour qualifying school at La Manga in November.

PETER Haining, Scotland's world lightweight sculling champion, won a
tight semi-final yesterday at the world championships in Tampere,
Finland, to stay on course for a record-breaking third title today.
In the second semi-final, Haining went out into an early lead and
looked like qualifying comfortably by the halfway mark, when he had
clear water over the rest of the field. However, in the second half of
the race three scullers, from Finland, Denmark, and the Czech Republic,
found themselves in a scrap for the other two qualifying places and all
closed up on Haining as the finish line approached. ''I wasn't
flustered,'' Haining said afterwards. ''I knew exactly how many strokes
were left to the line, but I stuck in a couple of big ones just to make
sure.''
This scramble for the line meant that Haining's semi-final was a good
three seconds faster than the other, which was won by Ireland's Niall
O'Toole, so, like last year, the stage is set for a showdown between
these two today.
Earlier, Britain's Olympic and World champion pair, Steve Redgrave and
Matthew Pincent, cruised into their final, while the coxless four with
Jonny and Greg Searle aboard, won their semi-final, beating world
champions Italy and reigning Olympic champions Australia in the process.
These British finalists may well be joined by the lightweight coxless
four early today. Their semi-final was postponed yesterday following a
severe hour-long thunderstorm and downpour at the course.

IF Bernard Gallacher wanted to see a Welshman at the top of the
leaderboard when he arrived at the Volvo German Open in Stuttgart
yesterday, then he was granted his wish. But it is Paul Affleck, not Ian
Woosnam, who heads the #650,000 tournament after an opening
seven-under-par 64.
It equalled the 29-year-old's lowest round on the European tour and
the Chester-based player finished the day one ahead of Scotland's Paul
Lawrie -- another man not involved in the final scramble for Ryder Cup
places.
Affleck is two in front of a group which includes Cup hopefuls Darren
Clarke of Northern Ireland, Swede Jesper Parnevik, and Spaniard Jose
Rivero.
Woosnam, who, like Parnevik, is playing the last qualifying event at
the request of European captain Gallacher, is still thinking of
switching to a broomhandle putter after a 69 left him five adrift. He
was four under with four to play but missed from six feet and under two
feet, both for bogeys.
Woosnam must finish in the top three for a cup place. Parnevik has to
be first or second.
Lawrie currently lies a lowly 129th in the Order of Merit and unless
the 26-year-old from Aberdeen, joint sixth in the 1993 Open, improves on
that in the two remaining months of the season he will have to go back
to the tour qualifying school.
In a bid to prevent that happening, he switched to Nick Faldo's coach
David Leadbetter last month. ''I just felt he was the best and I wanted
the best,'' he said. ''I'm not worried about how much it costs.''
On a day of low scoring, defending champion Colin Montgomerie could
only match Woosnam's 69. Leading scores (British or Irish unless
stated):
64 -- P Affleck.
65 -- P Lawrie.
66 -- J Rivero (Spain), J Parnevik (Sweden), M McLean, P Eales, D
Williams, D Clarke.
67 -- J Coceres (Argentina), T Levet (France), G Brand Jr, M James, R
Rafferty, A Oldcorn, F Lindgren (Sweden), O Rojahn (Norway), M
Mackenzie, S Struver (Germany), J Sandelin (Sweden), A Sorensen
(Denmark), E Simsek (Germany), P Moloney (Australia), D J Russell, C
Cevaer (France), P Quirici (Switzerland), D Carter.
Other scores included: 68 -- S Torrance, D Gilford, P Walton. 69 -- G
Orr, I Woosnam, B Lane, C Montgomerie. 70 -- B Langer (Germany), M
Miller, D Robertson. 71 -- H Clark, M A Jimenez (Spain). 72 -- A Hunter,
S McAllister. 73 -- R Drummond. 75 -- C Cassells.
* BILL McColl battled through high winds to score a second-round of 70
in the #65,000 Coca-Cola Open, a European Challenge Tour event, at the
East Sussex National course yesterday. The 38-year-old from Dundee, now
club pro at Thorpe Hall in Essex, qualified him for last two rounds with
three strokes to spare on 144.
Also through is Scotland's Raymond Russell (72, 75 - 147), but two
other Scots, William Guy (73, 82) and Lee Vannet (76, 78) both failed.

DAVID Harte, the skipper of Ireland's Dream of Erin, looked set for a
comfortable victory in the second leg of the Teacher's Round Britain
Challenge. Harte had rounded the final mark, Hamilton Rock buoy and was
less than two hours from the Rothesay finish late yesterday evening.
He had re-opened a 20-mile lead over the second placed Welsh crew on
Pride of Cardiff skippered by Richard Tudor.
Despite 20-25 knot breezes, Tudor found a calm close to Ailsa Craig
and was parked for more than an hour. This allowed Harte to rebuild the
lead which Tudor halved during the course of yesterday.
Scotland's John Fitzgerald, skipping Glendronach, also made
significant inroads yesterday, rising another two places to challenge
third-placed Vivian Cherry's Spirit of London Docklands.

NEW YORK: Life magazine photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt, who took the
famous VJ Day picture of a sailor kissing a woman in Times Square, has
died at 96 in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The photo of a uniformed
sailor kissing a nurse was revived recently for celebrations marking the
Allied forces victory over Japan 50 years ago. Other notable pictures he
took during his more than 60-year career were the actress Marlene
Dietrich posing in a tuxedo and Mussolini shaking hands with a youthful
Hitler in pre-war Europe.

order to extradite him to Italy. It then released him. Bonn's Justice
Ministry said its extradition request was being sent to Buenos Aires
immediately. Italy is seeking Priebke, who is 81, for his role in the
Ardeatine Caves massacre of 335 civilians in 1944 near Nazi-occupied
Rome, Italy's worst wartime atrocity. Priebke has lived in Argentina
since 1948. He has admitted having taken part in the massacre but said
he was following orders.

Seattle
A BOY of nine who was left in charge of his little sister shot her
dead with their father's hunting rifle when she refused to go to her
room.
Prosecutors in Oregon have charged Brandon Roses with the juvenile
equivalent of murder over the objection of his parents, who insist he
did not mean to kill five-year-old Charolette.
''A nine-year-old cannot even comprehend taking somebody's life on
purpose,'' said Brandon's mother, Laurel Roses.
But prosecutors contend that Brandon, now 10, killed his sister in a
fit of anger.
A hearing continues today to determine if Brandon should be removed
from his home for at least 30 days for a psychiatric evaluation. His
family wants him to stay home or with an aunt while he gets counselling.
The family has been seeing a therapist recommended by their church.
Mrs Roses testified yesterday that she left Brandon in charge of his
sister and six-year-old brother on June 23.
Brandon became annoyed with Charolette and told her to go to her room,
but she refused. He then took the empty rifle from his father's closet
and loaded it with shells that he found in one of his brother's lockers.
Mrs Roses wept as she confirmed prosecutors' account of the killing.
Brandon, seated at the defence table with his father, often looked
bewildered, but smiled occasionally at family members and friends who
packed the courtroom.
''This is a real sensitive little boy, and they're just destroying his
life,'' said Brandon's grandfather, Ramon House. ''The little boy knows
he disobeyed his parents. He feels real bad about it.''
But Detective Craig Roberts testified that Brandon's teacher said he
had become defiant and confrontational over minor issues in the months
before the shooting. ''The family was an accident waiting to happen,''
Roberts recalled the teacher as saying.--AP.

Papeete
THE crew of Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior II, flagship of a protest
flotilla sailing to France's South Pacific nuclear test site, vowed
today to defy the French military in a bid to stop blasts going ahead at
the small coral island of Mururoa.
But authorities in French Polynesia warned the environment group that
the 12-mile exclusion zone around Mururoa atoll must be respected and
that, if pushed, the military will again take control of the Rainbow
Warrior.
''We will try to be as soft as possible of course, and to manage the
situation without endangering the lives of people on the boats,'' said
Delphin Graeff, a senior spokesman for French Polynesia's High
Commission in Tahiti.
''But at a point we will have to stop it. If they don't stop
themselves, you have to take control of the boat,'' Graeff said in the
Tahitian capital, Papeete.
Earlier in the day, after arriving in Tahiti from Fiji, the crew of
the Rainbow Warrior, including veterans of some of Greenpeace's most
daring protests, said they would again challenge the French military at
sea.
Last month, the ship was stormed by French commandos firing tear gas
after it entered the exclusion zone around Mururoa, which lies 750 miles
southeast of Tahiti.
''Greenpeace has gone inside the exclusion zone for the last 20 years
and we certainly are not going to stop now,'' anti-nuclear campaigner
Stephanie Mills told an on-board news conference after the ship docked
in Papeete.
Rainbow Warrior's British captain Jon Castle, who was involved in
Greenpeace's daring campaign to scuttle Shell Oil's aborted attempt to
sink a disused North Sea oil platform, said he was ''prepared for
anything'' after the last confrontation off Mururoa.--Reuter.

Warsaw
ONE Pole in a hundred earns their living exclusively from crime and
the number of crimes is rising steadily, the Interior Ministry said
today.
''For some 300,000 people crime is the sole source of income, and
about one million people are engaged in crimial activity on a regular
basis,'' Deputy Interior Minister Jerzy Zimowski told a news conference.
He said crimes rose sharply in Poland, which has a population of 38
million, after the fall of communism in 1989 when police lost many of
their powers and the country opened to the outside world.
''In 1989-1990 the number of crimes jumped by 60%, stabilised for
three years at the level of about 870,00, and then started to rise
steadily to reach some 900,000 last year,'' Zimowski said.
A serious reason for concern was a rapid growth of organised and
economic crime, including drug trafficking, car thefts, smuggling, and
banking frauds.
''This is the most dangerous phenomenon because the police have no
experience in fighting it,'' Zimowski said.
The government has approved a package of anti-crime laws allowing
police to mount sting operations, providing for better protection of
witnesses, and imposing stiffer jail terms on those convicted of
organised crime.--Reuter.

ZAIRE halted its expulsion of Rwandan refugees today and kept troops
out of camps as an agreement on voluntary repatriations by the UN was
negotiated.
United Nations officials said they had no reports of Zairean troops
entering any refugee camp in eastern Zaire for the first time since the
forced mass expulsions began on Saturday of thousands of refugees from
last year's civil war in Rwanda.
Governors of North and South Kivu regions bordering on Rwanda and
Burundi told the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that the
expulsions were suspended before talks in the Zairean capital Kinshasa.
Zairean troops had dumped 15,000 refugees on the border with Rwanda
since Saturday, prompting an estimated 133,000 to flee their camps for
hills and villages to escape the sweep.
After the suspension, 34 refugees were trucked back to their camp near
the town of Bukavu from the border with Rwanda. UNHCR spokesman Chris
Bowers said he hoped the suspension would continue on Friday and UNHCR
was seeking assurances from the Zaire government that the expulsions had
stopped for good.
In Kinshasa, the government signalled it would approve the the UN
programme for voluntary repatriation.
''The international community has examined the announcement by which
the UNHCR says it is ready to take over the ongoing repatriations, on
the initiative of the Zaire government. The government and the president
take note of this announcement with satisfaction,'' Foreign Minister
Gerard Kamanda said in a statement.
''We are going to discuss the transformation of the operation from one
of forcing the refugees back to one of voluntary repatriation,'' a
government spokesman said.
UN officials said they had the capacity to truck 5000 people daily to
Rwanda. ''We understand there are a considerable number of refugees who
want to go home,'' Bowers said.
More than a million refugees, all Hutus, fled to Zaire from Rwanda to
escape civil war last year before the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic
Front seized power from the Hutu government.
Many fear they will be killed in reprisal for the genocide of up to
one million Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops and militiamen, who
escaped to Zaire along with civilians.
UN officials said they had received letters from several camp leaders
saying people wanted to go home voluntarily if they were escorted by
UNHCR rather than be left at the mercy of Zairean troops, who have been
looting and beating them.
UNHCR field officer Lino Bordin said UNHCR trucks were expected to
take people out of the vast Kibumba and Kitale camps on Friday and the
Mugunga and Lake Vere camps on Saturday.
Kibumba camp leader Jean-Baptiste Sibomana told Reuters that the camp
leaders had written to UNHCR: ''We accept a mass repatriation under
UNHCR and that our people want to go back.''--Reuter.

Islamabad
MEN armed with crude bombs and clubs, smashed cars, televisions, and
computers and scattered papers in an attack on the BBC's office in the
Pakistani capital Islamabad today.
The gang of young thugs shouted the slogans of a militant Sunni Muslim
group and beat up two BBC correspondents, although no-one was seriously
hurt.
''They were ferocious, smashing everything in the office. No-one dared
stop them,'' said Zafar Abbas, the BBC's Urdu-language correspondent in
Pakistan.
Chief correspondent Daniel Lak, a Canadian, locked himself and his
five-year-old daughter Kate in a washroom after the raiders beat and
threatened him.
Lak's wife Rosemary Parker grabbed their 20-month-old son Robert and
jumped several feet off a balcony before running to a neighbour's house.
After ransacking the office the raiders threw a firebomb that set
carpets and household items ablaze.
No-one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but the men
shouted slogans in favour of the jailed leader of a militant Sunni group
which has been blamed for dozens of attacks against Pakistan's minority
Shiite Muslims.
One of its leaders had earlier threatened to hold demonstrations
outside the BBC office to protest against a BBC documentary.
The BBC said intimidation of its staff could not be condoned and urged
the Pakistani government to provide protection.
Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto later condemned the attack as
an ''act of extreme cowardice by a handful of misguided elements'' and
promised full protection to the BBC staff.
She said those responsible deserved ''the severest punishment for this
shameful act'' and ordered the Islamabad authorities to investigate and
catch the attackers immediately.
* Airline security guards shot dead two men on a domestic flight in
Pakistan today after they attacked and seriously wounded a member of
parliament of the ruling Pakistan People's Party.
National Assembly member Chaudhry Mohammad Ilyas was on a domestic
flight from Islamabad to his home town of Faisalabad in the Punjab.
The attackers, armed with a razor and scissors, started trying to cut
Ilyas's throat when they were shot.--AP/Reuter.

ANDREW Coltart, on his US Tour debut, plunged to a disappointing
opening round of 79, nine over par over the Firestone course, at the $2m
World Series of golf in Akron, Ohio, yesterday.
He was equal last, but in good company with US Masters champion Ben
Crenshaw.
''I didn't hit too many good drives, or second shots, or hole any
putts,'' was the way the Scot summed up his performance. ''It's a tough
course and I haven't played well for a while.''
He lipped out with a five-foot birdie chance at the first, then
bogeyed the par-5 second, the easiest hole on the course. The
25-year-old qualified to play by winning the Australian PGA championship
last November.
American Jim Gallagher shot a four-under-par 66 to lead the 47-man
field by one from Payne Stewart. Holder Jose Maria Olazabal was on 68, a
score he described as ''a miracle'' after missing many fairways. Leading
scores (Americans unless stated):
66 -- J Gallagher. 67 -- P Stewart. 68 -- W Austin, F Couples, T
Lehman, M McCumber, J M Olazabal (Spain), T Tryba. 69 -- M Calcavecchia,
P Mickelson.
Other scores included: 71 -- N Faldo (England), V Singh (Fiji), C
Pavin. 72 -- N Price (Zimbabwe), S Elkington (Australia). 73 -- W Riley
(Australia), G Norman (Australia). 78 -- J Daly. 79 -- B Crenshaw, A
Coltart (Scotland).
* BRIAN Barnes, in his first tournament since developing a leg ailment
following victory in the British Seniors' Open, shot a 74 to be seven
behind leader Brian Huggett in the Collingtree Seniors at Northampton.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
67 -- B Huggett. 68 -- P Butler. 69 -- M Gregson. 70 -- F Abreu
(Spain), J Morgan.
Other scores included: 72 -- D Dalziel 74 -- B Barnes, D Huish.
* COLIN Gillies, the Scottish Professional champion, shared top prize
on four-under-par 66 at the McDonald Pro-am yesterday with John Wither
-- who eagled the fourth and fourteenth -- and Stuart Kerr. Leading
scores:
66 -- J Wither (Paisley), S Kerr (Renfrew), C Gillies (Falkirk). 67 --
K Stables (Montrose), F Mann (Musselburgh), G Weir (Braid Hills). 68 --
D Thomson (Kings Links), B Dees (Praytis Farm Park), P Smith (Deeside),
S Henderson (Kings Links), C Everett (Caldwell), G Harvey (Grangemouth).

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Friendly Assurance has announced a big increase in premium
income this year as a result of a direct marketing campaign and more
generous rules for tax-free investments in friendly societies.
Scottish Friendly said its regular premium income had risen 24% to
#735,000 in the year to date, while new single premium business was up
56% to #488,000.
Marketing manager Harry Gibb said most of the improvement was due to a
direct marketing campaign through press advertisements launched two
years ago, which now brought in a third of all sales.
But he said the raising of the monthly limit for individuals investing
in friendly society tax exempt plans from #18 to #25 in May had also
helped.
Glasgow-based Scottish Friendly is one of the five largest friendly
societies in the UK, even though it is tiny when compared with the
country's main life assurance companies.
But Scottish Friendly noted that its own business is thriving at a
time when many of the industry majors are suffering setbacks.

WIRE and wire rope manufacturer Bridon is making a #21.2m rights issue
to fund the acquisition of a German company, Shalkeisel, and to help pay
for future expansion.
The terms are two new shares for every seven already held at 135p
each.
Chairman John Clayton said the acquisition of Shalkeisel for #5.9m
would significantly boost Bridon's manufacture, distribution and
servicing of steel wire rope for the industrial sectors of mining, deep
water mooring, bridge structures and offshore energy.
''It represents a major step in the development of the group
internationally,'' he added.
He said the rest of the funds from the rights issue would be kept to
one side for further possible acquisitions.
Bridon of Doncaster, once known as British Ropes, increased pre-tax
profits marginally to #3.5m compared with #3.3m in the fist half of last
year.
The interim dividend has been raised from 1.25p to 1.375p.

<TEXT>
JOBS are likely to be lost at the top-secret West Freugh air base,
near Stranraer, once a cost-cutting review is completed next month.
The base is one of the main employers in the Galloway area, which has
a high unemployment rate. Details of the jobs to be cut from the 200
people employed by Serco, the main contractor at West Freugh, are
expected by September 15.
Serco has been told by the range owners, the Defence Evaluation and
Research Agency, that it wants a cutback of 25% in costs at West Freugh
and the jobs cut is one of the options being looked at.
The air base is used for aircraft and air weapons testing on land and
sea and is just one of the many Government establishments facing
cost-cutting exercises brought about by cuts in the Ministry of Defence
budget and the falling demand for such services.
A spokesperson for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency said:
''The reduction in the requirements for testing of air capability
services has meant that contractors must make savings.
''We have asked Serco to make savings of 25% and how they do it is up
to them. But it is generally accepted that some jobs will go at the
base. However, the workers will know by September 15 who is going to be
affected, as the review will have been finished by then.''
She added: ''This has been brought about by the downturn in the
requirements by the Ministry for the range, which is used for testing
airborne requirements and surface-to-air missiles.''
* Meanwhile, the rundown of the top-secret weapons testing range at
Dundrennan, near Kirkcudbright, is going ahead and 30 of the 120 jobs
will have gone by the end of the year.
The Ministry of Defence announced last year that the firing range,
covering 4500 acres, is to close by the end of 1997, with only a
skeleton force of six remaining.
However, there are hopes that the Army may use the range for exercises
and defence chiefs are looking at various options.

A GLIMPSE of better times in the commercial property market was

from ''a wide range of businesses''.
Industrial and office space was leasing well and rent levels had
stabilised, said chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs. ''As coporate expansion plans
resume, we can expect good growth in rents for quality, well-located
properties.
''However, it will take time for market improvements to be translated
into significant earnings growth.''
UK property investment market activity had remained quiet, though
demand for industrial and office space had continued to make progress,
added the company.
For the six months to June 30 taxable profits were #32.8m against
#33.3m in the corresponding period last year.
The interim dividend stays at 3.1p after earnings of 4.9p compared
with 4.7p.

<TEXT>
LANARKSHIRE Development Agency (LDA) said yesterday it will spend
#12.1m on linking the Eurocentral railway freight terminal near Mossend
to the M8 motorway with a special interchange and link road.
Construction of the interchange and a two-mile-long link road will
start in late 1996 after work on a #125m upgrade of the M8 in North
Lanarkshire -- funded by the Scottish Office -- gets under way.
Eurocentral, which was opened in July last year, is the Scottish
terminal for freight trains running through the Channel Tunnel to
different parts of Europe. An industrial park has been established
alongside it.
Eurocentral currently exports 2500 tonnes of goods per week on trains
to France, Italy, Spain and the Benelux states, and aims to become the
main interface for road and rail transport in Scotland.
''A direct link between Eurocentral and the national road network is
fundamental to the development's success as a world class industrial
park,'' said LDA chief executive Archie Bethel after expenditure on the
motorway link was approved.

The trade mission includes representatives of seven Scottish companies
and Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University.
The university hopes to promote its courses in public administration

Scottish exports to Taiwan amounted to #58m in 1993, the last year for

RENTOKIL yesterday continued its remarkable record of hefty pre-tax
profit increases with a 23.1% rise to #99.2m halfway through the year.
The environmental-to-security services group has been lifting profits
consistently by at least a fifth every year over the last decade as it
expanded out of its traditional pest control business.
For the latest half-year to June 30, Rentokil's profits improved from
#80.6m in the corresponding period last year.
Chief executive Clive Thompson said there had been particularly good
performances achieved by its security, communications, medical services
and tropical plant businesses.
In Europe, improved economic conditions had shown through in these
results, he said. Across the group worldwide turnover had increased by
12.3% to #401m.
The interim dividend is 1.23p compared with 1p, while earnings per
share for the group, based at East Grinstead in West Sussex, were up
22.8% to 6.51p from 5.3p.

<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976715830</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATE ferry consortium is facing opposition over its plans to
introduce a new route linking Jura to mainland Argyll.
Construction of ferry terminals at Keills, eight miles south of
Tayvallich by Lochgilphead, and Lagg Bay, near Craighouse on Jura, are
being opposed by Argyll and Bute District Council planning officials
following objections from Historic Scotland, Strathclyde Regional
Council, Scottish Natural Heritage, the Nature Conservancy for Scotland,
and local residents.
The Islay and Jura Ferry Company Ltd had planned to introduce the new
service as an alternative competitive crossing to the Caledonian
MacBrayne operations from Kennacraig across the Sound of Jura.
Following environmental assessments, numerous objections were
received. These included complaints that the siting of the mainland
terminal in a regional scenic area would have an adverse environmental
impact and would irreversibly damage important archaeological features
in the area.
According to the Nature Conservancy Council, the proposed terminal at
Keills would be within the proposed West Tayvallich Peninsula SSSI (Site
of Special Scientific Interest) and would therefore have a significant
effect on the geology of the area.
Residents objected to the need for road widening to the site, which
would ''adversely affect the botanical interests of the surrounding
land'' and ''have a detrimental effect on the quality of life in
Tayvallich due to the increased levels of through traffic''.
According to Argyll and Bute District Council's director of planning,
Mr George Harper, the site at Keills encompasses the Knapdale national
scenic area.
He added: ''The proposed ferry terminal raises significant landscape
impact and infrastructure concerns and has not been significantly
justified in terms of locational or operational need or economic
benefit.''
Similar objections were lodged to the ferry site at Lagg Bay, Jura.
The harbour there has been designated an ancient monument within a
national scenic area.
The district council's planning and building control committee is
expected to uphold the objections and refuse the application when it
meets next Thursday.

CHRISTIAN Salvesen has clinched #14m of new distribution business in
Europe over the last six months, signing large contracts in Holland,
Portugal and Italy.
Chief executive Chris Masters said this achievement reflected the fall
of internal barriers within the the European Union and growing
recognition of the expertise of UK companies in running trans-national
distribution chains.
Christian Salvesen's latest contract is with Galbani, a leading
Italian manufacturer of cheese and prepared meat products.
The Edinburgh-based distribution and specialist plant hire company
will manage a temperature-controlled warehouse near Milan which
distributes Galbani products throughout northern Italy.
Other large distribution contracts have been signed recently with the
Dutch dairy products firm Frico Domo, the Dutch division of United
Biscuits and Ford's spare parts business in Portugal.
Mr Masters said the expansion of distribution business appeared set to
continue.
''The enquiry rate for new business -- particularly in continental
Europe and particularly from manufacturers -- is very strong at the
moment,'' he said.
Christian Salvesen's overall performance this year was in line with
expectations and he was ''quietly confident''.
On the plant hire side, the summer heatwave had brought a surge in
demand for cooling equipment, he noted.
Christian Salvesen made a pre-tax profit of #104m on turnover of #646m
in the financial year to March.

THE farmer's ambition is to continue working the land and caring for
livestock, not to become a park-keeper, Mrs Christine Thomson, of West
Park, near Grandtully in Perthshire, told Scottish Office Agriculture
Minister The Earl of Lindsay yesterday.
The minister, on a visit to farms in the Breadalbane Environmentally
Sensitive Area scheme, indicated his agreement. It was important to help
farmers and people living in small rural communities to retain their
independence, he said.
''I think the extreme example would be if the landscape became a theme
park and you became franchise holders rather than farmers,'' he added.
It was important to support farmers carrying out farming activities.
If agriculture could not provide a sufficient job base there should be
encouragement for other small associated crafts and industries. ''We
want to be very careful about the rural situation.''
Brothers John and Donald Thomson, who farm West Park and Pinacree
Farms with their families, employing five people, have been enthusiastic
supporters of the ESA scheme, modifying their farming operations to meet
environmental objectives. While they are happy to show sympathy for the
environment, they emphasised that there also had to be understanding
from the Agriculture Department that the farming operation was intended
to provide a living for the farmer. ''We have to live as well as
conserve,'' said Mrs Thomson.
Lord Lindsay assured the Thomsons and neighbouring farmers at
yesterday's hillside meeting that there was a renewed emphasis on
partnership and on balancing the needs of the farmer with those of the
environment in which he was farming. ''We are now clever enough to
realise that these are one entity.''
The Scottish ESA system had advantages over its English counterpart,
he said. There was a ceiling on payments and a requirement that the
entire holding be managed in the interest of the environment. This meant
that many more farmers could become involved rather than have some
large-scale applicants getting six-figure grants and using up most of
the available money.
He forecast that in 10-20 years most public money allocated to support
farming would be directed at enterprises like West Park which were
maintaining the landscape and providing woodlands and mixed land use.
Under the ESA scheme in Scotland a farmer is paid #2000 a year as an
incentive to join and can qualify for a further #4000 to finance the
enhancement of conservation areas. In some cases, the minister was told,
farmers found they had to use their own money to top up the grants for
projects such as fencing or replacing dry-stane dykes.
''I am in favour of the ESAs but there are some points I am very much
against,'' said John Thomson. ''There is one bit where we used to winter
cattle. When you went out to feed them, hundreds of small birds came
down to feed too. All their natural sources of food were frozen solid.
Now these cattle are housed to protect the grazing but what happens to
the small birds?
''Sometimes I feel the ESA decisions are made in June when the sun is
shining. They should come up and see conditions here when the snow is on
the ground.''

ENTERPRISE Oil finally closed the book on its #1600m attempt to
takeover fellow oil independent Lasmo when yesterday it sold its 9.8%
stake to raise #166.4m.
The 94.6 million shares were sold to Cazenove and SBC Warburg at 176p,
who placed them in the market to boost turnover in the stock to 245
million shares.
Enterprise originally acquired the stake at 168.3p in a market raid at
the end of June last year, and subsequently wrote their value down to
150p.
It managed to gain acceptances for only 32.8% of the Lasmo equity, its
bid having failed partly because of the complexity of the all-paper
offer with there being no cash alternative.
The disposal had been expected for several months.
By the close, Lasmo shares had slipped 2p to 182p, while Enterprise
were 6p better at 182p.
Enterprise will use the money for general group development, with
expenditure this year expected to amount to over #320m.

THE Confederation of British Industry expects UK interest rates to
rise by a further half-point this year to dampen down any residual
inflation threat despite yesterday's reduction in German interest rates,
writes CHRIS STONE.
At the same time, it is forecasting that growth in manufacturing
output will be almost halved to 2.2% from the 4.3% predicted in May.
However, the 4% growth expected in 1996 is broadly similar to the
previous forecast. The reduction for 1995 reflects recent CBI survey
evidence and the lower than anticipated out-turn in the first half of
the year.
Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser, said: ''Our central
forecast suggests that the UK economic outlook remains sound -- the
slight hesitancy in the pace of growth in early 1995 is likely to prove
short lived.
''Continued strong competitive pressures, in the retail sector in
particular, mean we consider that a further half-point rise in interest
rates should prove sufficient to bring underlying inflation within
hailing distance of the Government's 2.5% target at the end of 1996.''
The CBI does not consider that the German move on interest rates makes
any difference to its forecasts, which assumes UK base rates will peak
and stabilise at 7.25% by the final quarter of 1995.
GDP growth this year is expected to be 2.9%, down from the 3.3%
forecast in May, while the figure of 2.8% for 1996 remains unchanged.
Overseas demand for British manufactured goods is still at a healthy
level, but is less buoyant in August than at any time this year,
according to the accompanying CBI monthly trends inquiry, which also
shows that manufacturers reported a very slight improvement in overall
demand in the month.
Manufacturers' output expectations rose, with firms expecting marked
increases over the coming four months.
More firms expect to increase prices in the next four months rather
than reduce them, although the August balance of 13% is lower than
indicated in July, and the expected rate of price increase is at its
lowest recorded level since mid-1994. Six out of 10 companies expect
prices to remain unchanged over the next four months.
Among other findings of the monthly survey, companies still consider
the current level of finished stocks to be more than adequate, although
a little less so than last month. The positive balance of 13%, however,
remains the highest recorded in a monthly survey since May 1994.
In its forecasts, the CBI says that consumer spending was weaker than
expected in the first half of 1995, and is now expected to rise by 1.6%
this year.
Growth of 2.7% is expected in 1996, supported by a lower savings
ratio, higher real take-home pay, and benefits to consumers from planned
banks/building society mergers and from maturing Tessas.
Commenting on survey findings, the CBI's associate director of
economic analysis, Sudhir Junankar, said: ''The manufacturing recovery
seems to be slowing, reflecting less buoyant demand conditions in
overseas markets and subdued domestic orders.
''The survey suggests that manufacturers' stocks of finished products
have risen since the middle of the year, and also that companies'
expectations of output growth over the coming months have now moderated,
when compared with monthly surveys earlier in the year.''
The outlook for factory gate price inflation is regarded as being
''more encouraging'' than at any time over the past year. ''With
competitive pressures in the home and overseas markets remaining strong,
the peak in manufacturers' price expectations may well have been
passed,'' said Mr Junankar.

THE importance of the mightily-hyped launch of Windows 95 by
Microsoft, goes far beyond its impact on the world's largest software
company and its head Bill Gates -- now dubbed the world's richest man.
It is no exaggeration to say that this year's powerful rally on Wall
Street has occurred in anticipation of the product's success. The rally
has been fuelled by the technology sector, which these days is dominated
by computer software and hardware companies.
The NASDAQ index which, being angled towards smaller companies has a
disproportionate number of computer stocks within it, has risen 38% this
year against 19% for the Dow Jones Industrial. Microsoft shares are up
69%.
Given the domination of Microsoft in computer operating systems, there
is a lot of hope riding on the success of Windows 95 on behalf of other
software companies which have eagerly developed programs to use in
conjunction with the new Windows. Hardware manufacturers, too, are
expecting a lift in sales as people gear up to use the more demanding
program, which requires a lot more memory.
All the hype has whipped up a heady feeling among investors, which
leaves them open to disappointment should Windows 95 not prove the
overwhelming success it has been cracked up to be. Microsoft itself has
been keen to downplay the overblown forecasts in the stock market, which
is already discounting huge sales.
Optimists believe the majority of the world's 100 million personal
computer users will move over to what is being perceived as the new
industry standard. Microsoft suggests a take-up between 10% and 25% of
the 80 million machines now capable of running the system.
The pattern of earlier Microsoft releases has been for an initial
surge of sales to be followed by a sharp fall to lower but steadier
levels. In recognition of the likely repetition of this, Microsoft will
account for a third of sales, not as they are made but over an 18 month
period to smooth the impact.
The danger is that the depressed state of consumer confidence in most
markets will result in more people than expected deferring purchase or
not buying at all. Then the technology stocks will look very exposed and
a sharp correction will be inevitable.
This in itself will pull Wall Street as a whole lower. If it happens
to coincide with a quckening in the US economy, which some experts
consider likely, there is the possibility of a tumble of several hundred
points.
Other markets have not followed the US so strongly upward -- the
FTSE-100 index has only just reached its early 1994 high, while the Dow
Jones has been posting new highs for months -- but would inevitably
suffer from a hefty fall across the water.
A 1987-style crash is unlikely as economic conditions are not the
same, but a couple of hundred points off the UK index could follow.
At least there is no chance of Windows 95 being a flop. Microsoft's
sheer domination of the market and the huge marketing effort behind the
$1000m launch precludes this. To quote two examples, some 250 million
retail displays have been set up around the world and manufacturers of
80% of the world's personal computers have agreed to factory-install the
program in their product.
Industry observers believe Windows 95 will put such pressure on IBM's
operating system that it will be withdrawn within months, leaving just
Apple Macintosh as the only rival.
It has vociferous supporters but a small share of the market, so
Microsoft would be a virtual monopoly supplier.
This prospect has naturally attracted the US anti-trust authorities
and revelations coming from hearings, such as alleged intimidation of
rivals, show that Mr Gates is a ruthless competitor and not merely a
computer freak who just happens to have a head for business.
The major case against Microsoft relating to terms for the licensing
of Windows to computer manufacturers was settled last year, but a
potentially more damaging one followed. This threatened yesterday's
launch, prompting complaints of harassment by Microsoft.
The case concerns incorporation of easy access to Microsoft Network,
the group's own on-line information service, through Windows 95. Other
network providers like CompuServe argued that this gave Microsoft an
unfair advantage.
Fortunately the US Justice Department said it could not finish its
investigation by the time of the launch.
Long term, Microsoft needs to diversify into computer services such as
home banking and shopping to keep its momentum going, but there is a lot
of difference between dominance in basic operating systems to achieving
monopolistic market share in services where many existing companies are
already battle-hardened by competitive pressure.
So the ''evil empire'' of Microsoft conjured up by Apple Mac
enthusiasts looks somewhat over-exaggerated.

DEPARTMENT store Jenners revealed this week that sales have been hit
by the heat-wave which has prevailed during this year's Edinburgh
Festival.
Although Princes Street and its gardens have been packed, consumers
have preferred to soak up the sun rather than spend.
Paul Walker, assistant director of the Confederation of British
Industry Scotland, believes the hot spell has hit not only High Street
retailers, but also art galleries, museums, theatres, and cinemas.
Leading Scottish window company CR Smith and carpet-maker Stoddard
Sekers have also suffered a downturn in sales as a result of the
uncharacteristically good weather.
Jenners usually reaps rich rewards when domestic and overseas visitors
converge on the capital for the Festival.
Company secretary Stanley Reid said: ''The Festival seems very busy
this year.
''There are a lot of people in town but the fine weather is tending to
keep them out in the gardens and out on the streets and trade is not up
to expectations.''
Jenners, which is currently undergoing a #2.25m exterior
refurbishment, believes it is suffering because of the difficulties it
has in cooling its 100-year-old store.
Mr Walker said High Street retailers, museums, art galleries and other
visitor attractions were all finding people were staying outdoors.
He added: ''People have been outside enjoying the sun and they haven't
been driven indoors as is usually the case.''
Mr Walker believes the anecdotal evidence of the negative impact of
the sun on some parts of the retail sector may be reflected in
forthcoming CBI distributive trade surveys.
Attendances at Filmhouse, an independent cinema in Edinburgh's Lothian
Road, were down 25% during the couple of months preceding the start of
the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival, which has attracted cinema-goers
in spite of the weather.
The heatwave has made life tough for CR Smith, which is based in
Cowdenbeath, Fife.
Chairman Gerard Eadie said: ''We taper off in the month of July and
usually come back with a bang in August but this year it has been lower.
''This weather is a bad thing. It is putting people off spending.''
Stoddard Sekers, which is based in Elderslie, near Paisley, was down
about 20% in sales terms during July.
Chief executive Ralph Ellis said: ''We almost saw a situation where
demand fell over the cliff in July. We are quite convinced that the
weather had an impact.''

MINK, once bred for their fur, are threatening to wipe out entire
seabird colonies on some west coast islands, a leading marine researcher
has claimed.
Crofters and farmers are also so concerned at the threat to wildlife,
poultry, and fish stocks, that they have mobilised an army of trappers
in a bid to be rid of the menace.
Large numbers of mink have already caused widespread devastation from
Campbeltown, on the tip of Kintyre, to most of the Argyllshire mainland.
The only islands, so far, to be ''mink free'' are Coll, Tiree, Colonsay,
and Gigha.
Ms Kirsten MacCallum, a development officer with the Oban-based
Farming Forestry Wildlife Advisory Group (FFWAG), has just completed a
year-long study into the scale of the problem.
Her findings from questionnaires sent out to the farming community,
show the problem is widespread in many areas, and acute in some. She
says more money will have to be found if the slaughter is to be halted.
The report supports concerns expressed by Dr Clive Craik, of
Dunstaffnage Marine Research Laboratory, who has been monitoring the
steadily rising population for several years, and claims that entire
seabird colonies on some islands could be threatened with extinction if
the mink are not stopped.
The animals, which escaped from captivity or were released from farms
where they were once bred for their pelts, are known to be ''surplus
killers''.
In a typical killing spree, a single mink can wipe out a hen run with
a hundred birds in a single visit, leaving all the carcasses behind.
Young birds in nests of ground-breeding seabirds have little chance of
survival.
Islanders on Lismore, concerned at the mink threat, attended a packed
public meeting this week to learn trapping techniques.
The nearby island of Kerrera is now free of mink after islander Gregor
MacGregor trapped 50 of the animals in the past few months.
FFWAG is to distribute thousands of leaflets to crofters, farmers, and
fish farmers, outlining measures which can help to control numbers.
Ms MacCallum said: ''The mink is a very bold creature which is not
scared of humans. It can swim up to three miles to reach the islands.
''The worst effects, so far, have been on seabird colonies, and that
is our main concern.''
She believes trapping and humane disposal is the most effective way of
controlling the mink and said 40 had been caught on the island of Luing.
If they had been left to run free, they would have wiped out vast
numbers of seabirds.
She added that the group received funding to employ a trapper during
the breeding season, earlier this year, around Loch Etive and Loch
Feochan, where bird colonies had been seriously affected. As a direct
result, common terns successfully bred there again for the first time in
eight years.

THE Bundesbank's decision to slice half-a-point off Germany's key
Lombard and discount interest rates was followed by cuts in other
European centres to help boost the flagging pace of recovery.
In Britain it is widely interpreted as further strengthening the arm
of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in his determination to keep interest rates
on hold against the wishes of Bank of England Governor Eddie George,
though the Governor has perhaps not been quite so emphatic as he once
was.
There is no serious suggestion as yet that UK rates could actually
follow Germany down. And indeed, the CBI is probably out on a limb in
predicting, despite the Bundesbank's move, that UK base rates will
actually rise by half-a-point to 7[1/2]% by the year-end, to put the
Government's inflation target back on course.
The CBI's own surveys indicate a slowing in the rate of economic
growth this year and the construction and housing markets continue to
suffer, but the employers' body is sticking to its forecasts.
In share markets, news of the drop in rates provided some cheer on an
otherwise uninspiring day, on the basis that it should at least mean no
rise in UK rates. The FTSE-100 made up some of the ground lost earlier,
but still only managed to inch ahead by just 4.1 points to 3520.0 at the
close.
On the foreign exchange market, sterling initially gained almost two
pfennigs against the German mark as one of the main beneficiaries of the
German rate cut, but by the finish after a seesaw day it was down at
2.2803, compared to an overnight of 2.848. It closed higher against the
dollar at 1.5437, against a previous figure of 1.5415.
The dollar had also tumbled against the German unit after early
strength following US data showing an unexpected 1.7% drop in US durable
goods in July and a 10,000 rise in weekly jobless claims.
Markets had been expecting the Bundesbank to reduce rates, but
analysts were split as to when action would be taken. The Bundesbank
likes, or appears to like, wrongfooting markets, but this was not the
case this time.
On Wednesday, there was a sharp fall in the Bundesbank's money market
repo rate. This followed an unexpected contraction, revealed on Tuesday,
in the main German money supply in July.
The Central Bank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, had also commented that
lower rates could not be ruled out. So it all added up to a change in
rates and any speculation merely centred on the timing.
The Bundesbank said yesterday that weak money supply was the main
reason for its half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates to 3.50%
and 5.50% respectively.

WEIR Group offset a poor first-half performance by its main UK
factories with good results from its US acquisition EnviroTech
Pumpsystems.
The Glasgow-based manufacturer of specialist pumps and valves
announced a 9% rise in pre-tax profits to #20.2m during the six months
to June 30.
But chairman Lord Weir said that without EnviroTech's vital
contribution, group profits would have been below last year's first-half
level of #18.5m.
Two large Weir Group companies based in the UK which account for
nearly 30% of group sales had a particularly difficult half-year due to
keen competition for contracts in the water, oil and power generation
sectors.
Weir Pumps, which has factories in Glasgow and Manchester, and
Strachan &amp; Henshaw, which manufactures fuel-handling equipment in
Bristol, turned away from some potential contracts because the margins
were so thin.
''We are not going to compete for business at rotten prices,'' Lord
Weir said -- defending the group's policy of insisting on reasonable
margins.
He said Weir Pumps had been hit by falling prices for power station
equipment in the Far East, cost-cutting in the offshore oil sector and
lower-than-expected orders from UK water companies.
Strachan &amp; Henshaw lost major contracts for coal-handling equipment to
state-owned Italian companies, which were undercutting the market with
the aid of subsidies, he added.
Weir Group turnover leapt 40% to #298.4m as thriving EnviroTech,
purchased for #135m in September 1994, made its first contribution to
first-half results.
Lord Weir said the US company, which manufactures equipment for the
mining and metal processing industries, had benefited from an upturn in
world metal prices.
EnviroTech has brought two key long-term benefits to Weir Group.
It has diversified the group's manufacturing base, bringing in a new
product range, and has opened up new overseas markets that will help to
insulate the group against an economic downturn in any one region.
Lord Weir welcomed the fact that the UK had lost its position as Weir
Group's main market during the first six months of this year, overtaken
by expanding sales in the Americas and the Far East.
North and South America provided 32% of the #300m of new orders
received during the period, followed by Asia and the Middle East with
28%. The UK was relegated to third place with 27%.
''I think it is a much better balance for our business than we have
had in the past,'' Lord Weir said.
As a sign of confidence the interim dividend was lifted 7% to 2.20p
per share from 2.06p, despite a fall in earnings per share to 7.3p from
8.1p.

GERMAN chemicals giant BASF should decide before the year-end what its
plans are for the Boots pharmaceuticals division which it acquired
earlier this year for #850m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
Chairman Dr Jurgen Strube said yesterday that a provision of DM300m
(#136m) had been made for reorganisation costs but added that the
Nottingham-based operations would continue as the research and
development centre for drugs treating the central nervous system.
He added that he could confirm that the UK was attractive for
manufacturing.
The Boots obesity drug Sibutramin is being registered in both the UK
and US this year and is expected to be a major contributor to the
group's pharmaceuticals division which is aiming for an overall 1%
market share in both Europe and the US.
He also ruled out a bid for Fisons which is the subject of a #1700m
takeover attempt by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, adding that BASF will not make
any major acquisitions this year.
In the first six months, group pre-tax profits jumped 196% to DM2025m
(#920m), helped by the combination of sharply higher selling prices and
an overall increase of 9% in volume.
An optimistic Dr Strube said that an ''economic downturn was not to be
feared for this year and next'' even if growth rates will be at reduced
levels. He added that consumer confidence in Germany has been improving
recently.
Group sales were 10.9% greater at DM25.6bn (#11.8bn) with those of the
UK subsidiary 48% better at #581m of which perhaps #50m was due to the
Boots acquisition.
The tapes operations are now breaking even but there is too much
over-capacity in the industry to make really adequate returns.
In plastics and fibres, the group said sales rose nearly 24%. But
fibre growth was modest due to dollar turbulence, while better prices in
PVC and Polyolefine helped plastics.
The mark's appreciation hampered exports in dyes and speciality
chemicals, hurting both sales and profits. Textile and leather chemicals
were particularly affected by the currency's rise.
The company also said the sales decline in consumer products continued
in the second quarter.
Information systems were particularly affected by exchange rate moves.
The price rises already applied should bring improvement in the second
half, BASF said.

AWAY from all this hysterical hype about Microsoft's new Windows 95
operating system, those of us who belong to the embattled enclave of
Apple Mac users have other concerns.
Virgin stores have recently stopped stocking software for the Mac
minority who perversely have, for years, been able to enjoy many of the
features Bill Gates is now bringing to the long-suffering mainstream of
computer users.
Of all the pieces of software I've purchased for our Mac, one of the
biggest hits with the kids has been the Sim family of programmes, which
challenge you to design and run cities from scratch. You design the road
and utility systems, designate industrial zones, open up areas for
housing and commercial development, and invest in schools, hospitals,
and public transport networks.
You decide on tax levels and how resources should be allocated. Get it
all right and the place, like Topsy, just grows and grows, as people
flood in. Get it wrong and your fledgling metropolis becomes stunted,
crime-ridden, a place from which more and more people flee.
Watching your kids argue over how much they should spend on the local
police or fire services, where to site the factories, whether to raise
local taxes even higher, is a real eye-opener. This is civic education
with an entertaining but purposeful bite. I've sometimes thought that
every would-be politician, local and national, should undergo a
compulsory extended course on Sim City, before they are let loose on
real people.
But just imagine, for a moment, that a Sim-style programme existed to
allow you to design the entire Scottish economy on screen, from scratch.
What industries would you include in your mix to maximise the overall
impact on jobs, orders, output, incomes -- the key ingredients which
make the difference between feeling good or feeling bad about Scotland
plc?
Would you brim over with nostalgia and opt for bustling shipyards and
red-hot steel mills? Or would you lure a phalanx of electronic Mr
Gates's to locate their global headquarters along the M8?
The priorities policy makers place on encouraging this sector or that,
their fiscal treatment of the products of different industries, the
balance they strike between encouraging inward investment and
stimulating indigenous development -- all these real decisions do impact
materially on the economy as a whole.
There is a perception, in current Government rhetoric, that the future
lies with sunrise industries. If you had to sketch an industrial policy
for an administration which claims not to have one, out of its actions
over the past 16 years, you might conclude that it is pinning its hopes,
as far as the Scottish economy is concerned, on the following mix.
Privatise everything you can get away with. Keep the labour market
more deregulated than our European neighbours. Preach the gospel of
individual entrepreneurial enterprise. And keep your fingers crossed the
teams at Locate in Scotland can continue to persuade enough overseas
firms to open up new plants here to employ an acceptable proportion of
those who haven't the drive or the nous to start up businesses of their
own.
In terms of both investment and jobs, LIS's main successes in recent
years have been in the electronics sector. Last year, thanks to a couple
of chunky semiconductor investments, no less than 78% of all planned
investment and 42% of all promised jobs lured here by LIS, came from
companies working with silicon technology. But do these industries --
dismissed by their critics as footloose screwdriver plants -- have a
significant contribution to make to the domestic Scottish economy?
The electrical and instrument engineering sector has certainly been
the star performer in Scottish manufacturing output in recent years.
Between the first quarter of 1992 and the first quarter of this year
output grew by a remarkable 79%, as more and more computers and chips
tumbled from the production lines. It is also our biggest exporter.
But it has long been acknowledged that the vast majority of the
components which go to make up the computers assembled here are
imported. That is the nub of the screwdriver plant charge. Some recent
analysis in the Government's own Scottish Economic Bulletin confirms
that picture.
The problem is that a sector which imports most of its components
cannot, by definition, add as much value to the host economy as one
which sources most of its raw material ingredients locally.
That point was made forcibly yesterday by one of the biggest companies
in one of Scotland's oldest industries, whisky. Allied Distillers
commissioned the Fraser of Allander Institute to go through its books,
assess its impact on the wider Scottish economy, and compare that impact
with other industrial sectors, like electronics.
The results have surprised even the authors. Unlike electronics, the
whisky industry sources most of what it needs to produce a dram right
here in Scotland. While Allied's whisky operations generate 3.39 jobs in
the wider Scottish economy for every direct job, the computer industry
manages just 1.33. In terms of incomes, the multiplier effect in the
whisky industry is 3.1 against 1.51 in computers. Whisky also
outperforms sectors like finance, pharmaceuticals, and paper products.
Of course there is a political agenda here. The Scotch whisky industry
feels itself hard done by, in fiscal terms, when 67% of the price of a
bottle is accounted for by tax and duties. It has long been campaigning
for equal tax treatment with other alcoholic drinks.
Then just when it thought it was getting its message through to the
Treasury, the Chancellor slapped another duty increase on last December
to make up for revenue lost by abandoning the second stage of VAT on
domestic fuel. As a result, UK sales of Scotch have been hit and Mr
Clarke's tax take from excise duties on spirits is down too.
The new Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, says he is open to
sensible suggestions for improving the Scottish economy. Once he has
digested the Allied Distillers report he might profitably chew the
Chancellor's ear about a fiscal inequality which is clearly depressing
the performance of an industry whose beneficial impact, pound for pound,
on the wider Scottish economy far outstrips some of its more glamorous
neighbours.

SHARPLY contrasting with the losses from rival Cordiant, advertising
group WPP has reported higher profits and a positive outlook.
Profits were at the top end of expectations with a 38% increase to
#48.5m for the six months to June and the interim dividend is raised 16%
to 0.445p. WPP shares gained 5p to 145p.
Chief executive Martin Sorrell said underlying revenue trends were
strengthening and the group was well on course to achieve its target of
operating margins of 10%.
Mr Sorrell has a strong incentive to achieve this, as even his revived
remuneration package could net him #28m over five years if demanding
targets are met.
The more generous original proposals were dropped after opposition
from institutions, which still cast 26% of the votes against the new
terms.
Margins reached 8.3% in the first half -- a percentage point up on a
year earlier -- and are expected to reach 9% over the year, with the
second half traditionally stronger.
Revenue growth is also improving, moving from 4% in the 1994 first
half to 6% in the second, and now 8%. Next year will see the benefit of
the Olympic Games and the US presidential election. Any Government
action to boost consumer spending would be to WPP's advantage as
advertising activity would rise.
The UK performed better than predicted, showing 12% revenue growth in
the six months, but it accounts for only a fifth of the total.
Some 40% comes from the US, where revenue rose 5%. The continent saw
6.6% growth and the rest of the world 11.5%.

IT has been a week for schools. We have the business of the heir to
the heir to the throne going off to his secondary school, that is, Eton.
In a quite ludicrous statement from the chairman of the Press Complaints
Commission it has been established that Prince William is ''just an
ordinary schoolboy, except that he is a prince''. Whit? Ordinary
schoolboy? He's going to bloody Eton. This makes him about as ordinary
as the Beast of Bodmin.
But what are ordinary schoolchildren anyway and what are ordinary
schools? The Prime Minister wants to change the ordinary in schools, as
well he might, for schools are not doing very well. He wants all schools
to opt out of local authority control. This way lies madness.
Speaking as a one-time teacher I can tell you about the madness. To
get promotion the dominie had to think up something bizarre enough to
require his presence for the rest of his teaching life on a working
party rather than in front of a class.
Wee slips of weemenfolk who had not quite managed to get enough
Highers to enter a university and trained as primary teachers instead
became powerful authorities and invented such surreal lacunae as, say,
the Initial Teaching Alphabet. Many an intelligent and creative boy and
girl to this day spells in tongues as a result.
But Mr Major wants all this to change. He wants to set out a new era
with a strong emphasis on getting teaching right and on discipline in
schools. From a chap who couldn't pass an O-level in circus tricks this
is surely a little rich but we let it pass. From a chap whose party has
overseen a drop in every academic standard -- apart from the sheer
invention of ersatz degrees and other spurious qualifications from what
might as well be nursery schools, it is not merely rich: it is opulent
enough for a Saudi Sultan. And just as corrupt.
Yet, yer Urban V here suspects that Major has glimpsed a change, a bit
late, but glimpsed it anyway. For schools are growing more conscious of
how horribly ineffective they have become. Witness the return of the
notion of school uniform.
There has been an astonishing return to school uniform in Glasgow
schools I have noted. Not of course in the sump schools where school
uniform consists of retina-shattering bright leisure-wear off the back
of a lorry and enough diamond stud earrings to weigh the little ones'
heads down to the ground.
But normal schools are back with the uniform. I never saw such
advertising for it just before the school hols broke up. (As a dominie I
used to loathe those ads for ''Back to Skool'': put a depression on you
it did.) Yet school uniform was, and remains, a good idea.
For a start it is cheap; a lot cheaper than Nike tops and Levi 501s.
It identifies each child when they should be at school in the first
place. It stops poorer kids getting a showing-up because other children
can afford more. It makes them feel, as well as look, like children.
It's nice.
But not always. But the other day I stood perspiring in the heat of a
lunchtime outside of my South Side club, watching the brats and
bratettes skipping merrily down the road. They were from all sort of
local schools, and they were all in school uniform. It was the middle of
a heatwave.
The first thing I noted was something I had not seen, or anway not
outside of the posh fee-paying shops, since I was a boy at school
myself, back in the 1950s. The girls were sporting grey socks. Grey
worsted knee socks, the ones I damn-near used to wear myself, which had
garters which left a red ring underneath your knee for the next five
years. I suddenly felt that fifties sense of blackened gloom. The girls
were wearing thick voluminous skirts of hodden grey, the boys grey
flannels, too big for them. Suddenly I was in the world of parish suits
and big hobnail boots and the Green Lady with the bone comb for nits and
Gentian voilet ointment for the impetigo.
There were two bursts of thought there. One was why they couldn't have
the children in dresses and lightweight shorts or drill trousers instead
of this implacable grey. The other was the greyness. The greyness of Mr
Major himself and the greyness of his education ideas. For black is
dramatic and white is virginal, and one is the absence of light and the
other the fullness of it. But grey is in between. Meaning grey can't
make up its mind. Neither can this Government and neither, if you ask
me, can education. And it's all awfully dull, just like the colour.

I WOULD like to congratulate The Herald on the publication of the
article by Brian Wilson, MP, on Down's syndrome and special children
(August 22). It was an excellent article, written sensitively, and
conveyed the real meaning of the word ''choice'' in the whole ''life''
issue.
I do not speak from a position of ignorance. I have had the privilege
of years of teaching children with Down's syndrome as well as those with
more profound and complex learning difficulties.
I have witnessed their successes and the happiness they can bring to
all around them. Every child is special, and it is with horror and
regret that I watch the growing trend towards a ''search and destroy''
mentality which is increasingly budget-led.
We have failed, as a society, if the only answer we can give to a
woman carrying a baby with a disability is ''we can't help you
financially, or with respite care, or with appropriate education and
post school provision, but we can terminate your baby's life''.
Brian Wilson's article, plus the recently published success of Clare
Henderson, a pupil with Down's syndrome at Taylor High School, New
Stevenson, prove that the right to life, irrespective of age, gender,
race, or ability, is at the heart of a caring society.
The recent articles by Stewart Lamont and Ruth Wishart on this basic
human right, pale into insignificance.

WHERE does one begin to reply to Ruth Wishart's article on euthanasia?
First of all the hysteria and muddied waters appear to come from her.
The only reason that she chose to mention the fanatical pro-lifers in
America was to tar all pro-lifers with the same brush -- a common
strategy employed by people lacking in logical argument.
One-sided reporting does no good to assist in debates on issues
affecting the sanctity of life. It might sell papers and encourage
correspondence but apart from these factors it remains sterile.
With a bit of research the author could have found out that the vast
majority of pro-lifers are as much against the use of extraordinary
treatment as they are against euthanasia in all its forms.
They also seek alternatives to suffering, particularly in supporting
the promotion of palliative care and the hospice movement.

CONGRATULATIONS are in order for The Herald Essay, An enigmatic
existence, by Emeritus Professor E M McGirr (August 19). Articles of
this quality enhance your own reputation, enrich your readers, and
encourage us to buy The Herald yet again.
With admirable scholarship, the professor sensitively traced the
unfolding and conflicting understandings of the nature of human life
beginning with Ancient Greece. For readers' evaluation, he respectfully
described opposing theories and practices and he offered us an insight
into the mystery of which each of us is the very personification.
Rightly did he assert the limitations of the unaided intellect and the
inadequacy of the materialism, pragmatism, and empiricism which flow
from it. He turned to Shakespeare -- There are more things in heaven and
earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy -- to place due
emphasis on first principles, spiritual truths and the ethics derived
therefrom. Professor McGirr's essay enlarged the mind.
What, however, is to be made of Ruth Wishart's article, Euthanasia
waters muddied by hypocrisy (August 21)? Human life was, here, at the
mercy of the closed mind. The professor's discourse was not Ruth
Wishart's way. Her clear intention was not to explore an issue, not to
persuade.
The conclusion was the thing and it mattered not if opponents were
derided, if views at odds with hers were undermined by caricature.
First principles were not even a last resort; spiritual truths were
not to be encountered; ethics was no more than the expression of
individualism.
Bio-ethics has for some time been the plaything of Ruth Wishart and
her views are yellowing at the edges. She has a duty to your readers to
update, broaden and deepen her knowledge of this subject if she intends
to raise her treatment of it above that of the radio phone-in.

THANK YOU for Ruth Wishart's article on euthanasia.
We all have to face the fact that we can now inflict survival upon
people who would, properly, have died if nature -- or God -- had been
left in charge.
We are wrong to do this. We are wrong to heed those ethically
insensitive people who appear to believe that survival is a sufficient
condition for the good life. Life is not necessarily worth living.

WITH reference to your report on August 19 about the new director of
housing for East Ayrshire District Council, I have to say that the
headline would have been more appropriate in one of the more salacious
tabloids than in a serious newspaper.
Quite what you were trying to convey, apart from upsetting John
Hillis's family, was difficult to discern from the article. No mention
at all of his talents or abilities -- just dirt-raking from the past.
As leader of the Conservative group in the present Kilmarnock and
Loudoun District Council, it has been my pleasure to work with Mr
Hillis, the director of housing. He is an excellent officer who has
carried out his duties in an extremely satisfactory and competent manner
to the satisfaction so far as I am aware of all parties represented on
the present council.
It therefore came as no surprise to learn that he had been apppointed
to the post in the new authority.
I am not a member of East Ayrshire, did not attend the interviews, and
therefore can make no comment on the comparative merits of those on the
short leet and in particular the present housing manager in Cumnock.
What I can say is that as director in Kilmarnock, Mr Hillis currently
holds a much senior and more responsible position than that particular
candidate and all other things being equal one would expect him to be
successful.
Finally Mr Phil Gallie's comments were unhelpful, and I do wish he had
contacted me before shooting from the hip.

I AM concerned regarding the potentially damaging impression given by
your report (August 19) in respect of the recruitment process in East
Ayrshire Council since all applications are treated equally and fairly
and appointments are made on merit as required by law.
The comments attributed to Mr Phil Gallie, MP, and an anonymous
Cumnock and Doon Valley District Council employee are particularly
regrettable. They take no account of the spirit of the Rehabilitation of
Offenders Act, 1974, a piece of legislation which carried all-party
support.
I straightforwardly refute the suggestion that there could be any
question of ''previous loyalties'' having been a consideration.
The case covered by your report was the subject of considerable media
attention both at the time and again when the officer was re-appointed
as director in another district council. The facts therefore have been
well-known for some time, both to local councillors and to employees in
the housing function within the area.
Over the past few years, the officer concerned has had an exemplary
record in a senior local authority position and has repaid in full the
trust subsequently placed in him by that district council.
In making this new appointment, East Ayrshire Council acted no
differently from any other of its appointments and after a rigorous
selection process appointed simply the best candidate to the job.

I AM sure I am not alone in being astonished by the narrow (simple?)
mindedness of Matthew Smith's letter (August 23).
Family values: what are they? It's all very well for Mr Smith to wave
his hands in the air and repeat the incantation but I think I can
confidently state that he cannot define this set of mystical rules.
It does, however, strongly suggest Mr Smith's own family background. I
should be rather surprised if he was not brought up in a ''nuclear
family'' where Daddy worked and Mummy looked after the house. Perhaps
that has served to blinker him.
Maybe he really cannot see that for huge numbers of people (myself
included) the world has never been and will probably never be like that.
He cannot seriously expect everyone to conform to this simple-minded and
impractical goal. I find it difficult even to contemplate the state of
affairs.
It may interest him to learn of a young lady of my acquaintance who is
a single mother. I hope he will consider for a moment how she came to be
in the situation. This girl was left by her fiance when he discovered
she had become pregnant despite his assurances that if she did, they
would simply bring their wedding forward.
She is now living off the state with her child through no fault of her
own. She is not alone in that. I defy Mr Smith to find a single parent
who chose to ''burden'' the state in this way.
It should also be noted that I know a few women with small children
and this lady is by far the best mother.
Who is Mr Smith to judge that, as he asserts in his letter, only the
well-off should have the right to have children anyway? His contribution
to the debate has been a worthy one. He has offered a prime example in
himself of the lack of reason of those who ''take the moral high
ground''.
I suggest that their argument be put from the mind of all reasonable
and intelligent people as inconsistent with observation.

SIMON FRASER, heir to the Lovat Fraser estate, plans to put sadness
behind him this year when he sets off on a working adventure in Chile.
The 18-year-old's recent family sorrow seemed distant yesterday when
he carried out one of his first duties as the new Lord Lovat. He was
back on home territory in the town of Beauly for the local charity
launch of the Cancer Relief MacMillan Fund's UK-wide ''biggest-ever
coffee morning''.
He will take over the estate of his grandfather on his 25th birthday.
The late Lord Lovat died at home in March, aged 84.
The new Lord Lovat's father, Master of Lovat Simon Fraser, suffered a
heart attack at a drag hunt in the castle grounds last year his uncle,
Andrew, was gored by a buffalo on an African hunting trip.
Lord Lovat said he believed he was adapting to his new role as head of
the family.
He added: 'The demands will be great but I believe I can adapt. This
is only my third official function and, so far, I really do enjoy it.''
He declined to answer questions on the sale of Beaufort Castle and the
family estate.
He said he had been encouraged to take off to South America after
success in school exams.
The Chief of Clan Fraser gained two Bs and a C in his A-level exams
and said he relished the prospect of travel before going on to
university next year.
Reluctant to divulge much more about his future plans, he was equally
coy about a girl friend who attended yesterday's event.
Welcoming Lord Lovat to the fundraising launch, Macmillan's Highlands
and Islands fundraising manager Casia Zajac said the aim was to break
the Guinness world record for the largest-ever coffee morning on
September 29.
Last year, the charity raised #1m, with 433,544 people participating
in the United Kingdom.

THE letter from Frank O'Hare, in which he describes the late Alison
Hargreaves as an ass, does absolutely nothing for women's rights but
says a lot about Mr O'Hare.
Does he not understand that some women have goals in life that they
wish to reach, albeit that those goals may be to the detriment of their
lives? Does he think that Lisa Clayton on her round-the-world sea voyage
did not have family who cared for and thought about her safety?
Ms Clayton was lucky -- this time; she achieved her goal and returned
home. Ms Clayton is and Ms Hargreaves was lucky to have the support of
their families in their personal quests.
I am of the opinion that Mr O'Hare thinks it is quite in order for the
Damon Hills and the David Coulthards of this world to participate in the
male world of motorsport, and for the ''men of the mountains'' to carry
on climbing, but the opposition of a female whose rightful place is at
home cooking, cleaning, caring for children, and generally running after
a self-opinionated person like Mr Hare, is just too much. Thank goodness
times have changed!

IT'S a long time since I wrote one of my anti-Festival polemics. In
the mid-term of the years I've spent domiciled in Edinburgh I took a
great scunner to its Grande Bouffe of invasive culture and began
rejecting it; partly because after 12 or 13 seasons of reviewing Fringe,
television, and film festival events (only grown-up critics get to do
the official Festival) I was suffering from sensory overload, and partly
because the three weeks of each August grew ever more crowded with
neo-festivals and sub-fringes and brought out the worst in locals and
visitors alike.
Including me. Excellence apart, the annual epidemic of quasi-cultural
mugging made me very bad tempered as I fought my way through streets
clogged with raging exhibitionists and impersonate impresarios who
sought to sell me their stock of high, low, or merely mediocre art. But
nothing caused the red mist to descend more thickly than the visiting
artist or the out-of-town journalist who, each Festival, casually
interpreted the character of my adopted city to the rest of the world,
and got it wrong.
The culprit in 1981 was the self-regarding actor/writer Colin Welland,
who compared Edinburgh to ''a stiff old maid in a massive stone skirt in
the folds of which her population live out their obedient,
toe-the-line-lives . . .'' Except, of course, when kindly emissaries
from the great engine-rooms of international art (like himself) expanded
the population's narrow minds and roused their dull spirits with gifts
of cultural enlightenment.
The culprit in 1982 was the geologically challenged Charlotte Du Cann,
who called Edinburgh ''a solid town, its heart hewn of granite'' (so
much for volcanic basalt and Craigleith sandstone) and opined: ''Though
at Festival time it may appear merry and metropolitan, its soul is
sober.''
Such hand-me-down platitudes: Edinburgh as the Knoxian Brigadoon,
animated only once a year by the magic of its Festival enchanters. Even
worse were the resident lickspittles who held the view (overheard at the
opening of the new National Gallery of Modern Art) that the city was
''only worth living in during the Festival''. Tar and feathers were too
good for such quislings.
I still hold the view that Edinburgh is only worth living in because
it doesn't have a festival(s) for 49 weeks of the year, but recently
I've begun to recover some zip for the event(s). This is partly because
the city itself is less embarrassed. Since the Festival Theatre was
completed and opened there are no ''hole-in-the-ground but still no
opera house'' stories to write; the new Traverse complex is a bold
success and the city's environmental set pieces are noticeably less
squalid. You can also eat imaginatively and variously in Edinburgh, even
if the visiting foodies who compile restaurant guides for London
newspapers are too easily beguiled by the voguish.
But the main reason, I think, that I'm learning again to enjoy August
in the city is that we locals feel less colonised, and less patronised.
I notice a subtle shift in the metropolitan manner of filing copy and
biting sound; Edinburgh is no longer the ''stiff old maid'' with a heart
''hewn from granite'' but the European city which mounts the largest
international arts festival in the world, unsusceptible to condescension
and civic psychoanalysis.
Some of this new respect has been earned by Edinburgh itself, some of
it is politically correct. The gurus and groupies of the metrocentric
arts establishment have begun to sense that Scotland is a tense,
prickly, complex little country and Edinburgh is a city which can't be
described in stale cliches and can't be judged by surface impressions.
It was a common accusation, for example, that the city goes en fete
grudgingly, resenting each hydra head -- Fringe, film, television, book,
jazz -- which sprouts to choke the pavements and jam the traffic. But in
fact the Festival and its progeny get more local support than any other
festival in Europe; and as both official and Fringe programmes beef up
the domestic input they reach that elusive constituency for whom culture
starts and stops with Fringe Sunday and free fireworks. The ''junior''
who washed my hair last week said she'd never been to anything before
but she planned to get tickets for the Citizens' production of
Trainspotting because she'd read the book.
But as the cultural convulsion heaves into another record year of
ticket sales, helped by this spellbinding summer, the usual question
recurs: is it all getting out of hand? The festive statisticians proudly
proffer the figure of 8517; that's how many people are performing in
Edinburgh this year, most of them assuming special privileges of
tolerance, co-operation, and appreciation as the birthright of the
''creative'' -- however opportunistic or tacky their shows.
The ''stiff old maid'' strains at her stays, unable to satisfy her
suitors, unequipped to supply enough Edinburgh bednights. The hotels
charge what they like, risking the defection of 1200-odd delegates to
the television festival to Glasgow, with their accountants on their
heels. Does it really make sense to serve every course of this feast of
festivals in the one sitting?
The argument has always been that each fete feeds off the others; that
the film festival wouldn't pay without the Fringe and the book festival
wouldn't happen without the official Festival. Time-serving apologists
for Edinburgh believe ''people won't come'' if they can't have the lot;
which is code for not getting the hot names in literature unless they
are enticed by the hot names in drama, music, dance, or film.
I can't believe this is true; or if it was once true I can't believe
that Edinburgh's redeemed reputation -- its international distinction as
urban masterpiece and cultural powerhouse -- isn't sufficient in its
appeal. The idea that ''people won't come'' belongs, surely, to the
outmoded cringe mentality of some of its natives.
The film festival in Cannes isn't underpinned by dance programmes; the
Salzburg music festival doesn't do books; there ain't no jazz and all
that at the Venice Biennale. Let Edinburgh's extrovert side unravel all
its festivals and festoon the year with them, put on a public face from
spring to autumn. Then we locals will have more to celebrate than the
cold sensuality of its private identity and introverted winter soul.

THE report of the Whyte and Mackay cricket final at Hamilton Crescent,
Glasgow, on Sunday is a gross distortion of the facts.
The match was played throughout the afternoon and early evening
without a hint of trouble. Late in the Drumpellier innings a group of
thugs who had been drinking heavily all day became involved in scuffling
and unacceptable behaviour.
No Drumpellier fans were involved at any time and we had around 200 at
the match. I am also certain that no real West of Scotland fans were
involved.
The police took action and removed the group leaders and the game was
concluded without further incident.
The suggestions in all the Monday papers that scuffling and running
battles took place throughout the day is entirely false. The great
majority of the crowd enjoyed an excellent match played by both sides in
a keen competitive spirit and it is a shame that such over-the-top
reporting suggesting otherwise should occupy so much front-page
coverage.
I am sure I speak for the West of Scotland Club, their supporters, and
our own in saying that we wish to be divorced from all this trouble and
can categorically state that no supporter of this club was involved.

THERE is never a dull moment at Dundee Sheriff Court. Like yesterday
when lawyer Tom Anderson made a bit of history with a plea on behalf of
a client who was destined to be banged up in Perth prison.
Mr Anderson told Sheriff Alexander Bolland that his client should be
spared the ordeal of incarceration because he suffered from a
psychiatric condition. What was the condition, asked Sheriff Bolland.
Agoraphobia, the lawyer replied. Having given due consideration to
this unusual plea, the good sheriff concluded that the client's
unfortunate condition would not be unduly worsened by a wee spell in
prison.
And there's more
THAT loveable London duo the Jamesons, who have brought their skills
north of the Border to broadcast to the nation on Radio 2 of a late
evening, have been dipping into the Edinburgh Festival. Ellen, Mrs
Jameson, took quite a strict line during an interview with dancer Mark
Morris.
How, she asked, could he square the athleticism of his artistic form
with smoking and drinking. Mr Morris said he could see no contradiction.
Mrs Jameson pursued the point at which Mr Morris declared that not
only did he drink and smoke but also he was ''a sodomite''. And he
didn't see how it affected his art. This information seemed to bring
that aspect of the conversation to an end.

THE Japanese are into football in a big way these days. Ian Smith of
Edinburgh sends us a copy of World Soccer Graphic, a glossy colour
publication catering for this latest Nipponese enthusiasm.
The mag has a special feature on Scottish football, complete with a
map pinpointing where the teams in our premier division are to be found.
We will not quibble with the little misprint where they refer to
Glasgow's third team as Patrick Thistle.
The Jap map also tells us that Edinburgh has only one premier team,
Hibernian. They more than make up for this by informing us that there is
a team based on the Hebridean isle of Tiree by the name of Hearts of
Middleton.
* It was only minutes after speculation appeared in the public prints
of a bid by Glasgow Indian businessmen to take over Maryhill's very own
premier division football team that the Diary had phone calls from fans
asking if it were true that the club's name was to be changed to
Chippati Thistle.

Uniform response
THE Diary has been causing fear and apprehension in the ranks of
Scotland's traffic cops -- for which we are deeply sorry. Honestly,
officer.
It began with our story earlier this month in which we reported that
an RAF fighter jet's automatic weapons system had locked on to a polis
radar speed device in the Borders and the results could have been
disastrous if the aircraft had been carrying live ammo.
Sir William Sutherland, Lothian and Borders chief constable, has
written to us saying: ''We now know that the incident did not occur and,
indeed, that it is technically impossible.'' This differs from the
information which the Diary had to hand when we ran the story but we are
perfectly willing to accept the chief constable's version since he is a
very nice man and has a lot of braid on his uniform.
Sir William is even more upset with the tabloid newspapers who
followed up the Diary story with headings such as ''Top Guns Zap Car
Cops''. Scotland's traffic cops can now go about their duties in an
easier frame of mind.
Trouble brewing
FEVERISH activities in the run-up to tomorrow's wedding of the Lady of
Traquair, Catherine Maxwell Stuart at Traquair House, include a crisis
not often encountered in the normal run of prenuptial angst.
Traquair, the oldest continually inhabited stately home in Scotland,
also has the country's smallest commercial brewery, set up by
Catherine's late father Peter in the brew house that used to cater for
the family servants and estate workers. But the run of hot weather has
been playing havoc with a special wedding brew of beer laid down for the
300 guests, who will tomorrow pack Traquair's tiny Roman Catholic
domestic chapel and a large marquee in the courtyard outside.
To keep the fermentation stable, the beer barrels are being constantly
hosed down and, thanks to the rescue operation and yesterday's dip in
temperatures, it now looks as though the brew will survive in prime
condition for the big day.
Catherine is marrying 38-year-old John Grey, a London design
consultant who plans to rebase to the Borders where Catherine and her
mother Flora devote themselves to making Traquair one of the region's
top tourist attractions. Tomorrow, however, the tourists will have to go
elsewhere. The house is closed for the afternoon.

AS a parent of a 10 and a seven-year-old may I reply to M T Kennedy's
letter (August 18) by saying that, of course, children use the pavement
for cycling with the approval of their parents, but they don't use it as
a race-track.
The eight-year-old son of a friend was stopped recently when riding on
the road and told by the police that he should be on the pavement until
such times as he had passed his Cycling Proficiency Test.
I do not encourage my children to ride on the road. There are enough
dangers for children these days without adding ''boy racers'' and other
motorists who race up my avenue daily.
I encourage my children to be responsible when riding, looking out for
people and dismounting if in busy areas and crossing very busy broads.
One local policeman confirmed my views and said he would not expect
his daughter to ride on the road and assured me his colleagues would
take the same line.
Surely responsible children riding on pavements with pedestrians is
preferable to young children riding bikes on roads where there are many
more cars and more accidents likely to happen.

AS a pedestrian, I object to the risk of injury caused by cyclists
riding at high speed on the pavement. However, as a cyclist I object to
the risk of death caused by drivers passing me at high speed with inches
to spare.
There have been some improvements recently but cycle lanes are still
conspicuous by their absence. Those who choose to cycle rather than
drive have to share main roads with drivers whose aggressive attitude to
cyclists is in marked contrast to that displayed in the rest of Europe.
Of course as a driver I object to pedestrians and cyclists who seem to
have a death wish when negotiating traffic. In short, understanding each
other's difficulties might be more productive than some of the one-sided
views which have appeared in print.

I WOULD be delighted to be able to visit Arduaine gardens and judge
the state (August 21), as for many years my sister and I have been
regular visitors and have much appreciated the beauty.
Unfortunately, when we went to visit this year we discovered that we
could no longer walk our dog round the gardens. Previously she had been
a welcome visitor as long as she was on her lead.
Under the National Trust dogs are no longer allowed in the gardens. As
the car-parking available is totally without shade, this meant that
after travelling from Glasgow we had to turn round without being able to
make our annual spring visit.

OUT of all the predictable and predicted catastrophes besetting rail
privatisation, the collapse of the West Coast Main Line private funding
initiative is the least unexpected.
The West Coast Main Line fiasco is qualitatively different from the
other recent stories which have restored rail privatisation to its
proper place on the political agenda and in public contempt. This is not
just one of 25 fragments for franchising. It is -- sorry was -- the
cornerstone of Tory boasts about introducing private capital into the
railway network.
It is not just the grand, and utterly improbable, scheme to upgrade
the West Coast Main Line using private money which staggered into
oblivion yesterday. It was also the wider Private Finance Initiative, on
which Tory promises of widespread infrastructural renewal -- railways
and roads, schools and hospitals -- have been based.
The inescapable fact is that private capital is averse to risk. If
they can put their money in with an assured prospect of reasonable
return, then they will play ball. Better still if, as with the
privatised utilities, they are assured the prospect of an unreasonable
return.
But the Tories are determined that public-private partnership can take
place only on the basis of forcing the private sector into an operating,
as well as investment, role.
When nip comes to tuck, they are not really interested in the
successful public operation of a railway line which has been modernised
with a substantial input of private investment. That reeks of
partnership and common sense. The political goals are private ownership
and private operation.
As a result, potential investors in the West Coast Main Line are not
only required to put their money in and then look for that reasonable
return. They are also to be compelled to run a railway service, which
few of them have any interest or expertise in doing.
In these circumstances, the private investors are bound to ask some
very basic questions. How long will they have the right to run this
railway? What's the competition like? What guarantees are there of
ongoing subsidy at a level necessary to make profitable operation
likely? The answers are, from their point of view, hopeless. In terms of
recouping investment, the seven-year franchise period is a mere blink in
time. There can be no guarantees of continuing subsidy, because it is
not in the gift of this or any other Government to commit its
successors.
Perhaps most intractable of all, there is the fact that public money
has recently upgraded the East Coast Main Line which now has trains
whizzing back and forward between London and Glasgow, as well as
Edinburgh. How can the West Coast Main Line, in its present reduced
circumstances and with the prospect of several years of major capital
works ahead, be assured of competing effectively? The root of the
problem lies in the Tory determination to fragment the railways. As long
as both the East and West Coast Main Lines were part of InterCity and it
was part of British Rail, it made perfect sense to phase modernisation
of two lines which complemented one another.
Having seen East Coast Main Line upgrading successfully completed, we
should now be well into the same process on the west -- utilising, if
necessary, a proportion of private investment. Seven years ago,
InterCity had a #700m scheme -- track, signalling, and trains -- to do
the same job in the west. That plan was kicked into touch. One
consultant's report followed another. Then privatisation came along and
it was decreed that East and West Coast Main Lines should be separate
private companies, locked in bitter competition. Another separate
entity, Railtrack, tore up all the reports and decided to introduce
satellite signalling, which is incompatible with existing trains.
As a result, the cost of upgrading is now #1billion, exclusive of new
rolling-stock. The idea of the private sector taking the brunt of that
package was a fantasy. Seven years have been wasted. Responsibility is
now hopelessly fragmented and we are back to square one. The losers in
all of this are passengers and communities which depend on the West
Coast Main Line. There has been no shortage of warnings that service
will continue to decline, unless there is major investment in track and
signalling. The fact that the route operates as well as it does is a
tribute to the Herculean efforts of the people who work on it.
It should never be forgotten that InterCity, before the Tories
destroyed it for the maddest and baddest of reasons, was a profitable
network. Within it, east subsidised west, south subsidised north and day
subsidised night. Abolition of internal cross-subsidy has so far led to
abolition of Motorail, three sleepers a night and overnight passenger
seating, but there is much more to follow.
InterCity is now only a marketing name. Instead of being profitable,
every one of its former parts is dependent on subsidy under the new
charging system. It is easy to identify the victims of rail
privatisation -- taxpayers, passengers, communities, and the railway
manufacturing industry which is heading rapidly for extinction because
nobody is in a position to order new trains.
The only consolation is that, day by day, the whole thing is
unravelling -- in plenty of time for those responsible to pay the
political price of their handiwork. But, in the meantime, now that the
mirage of private investment has disappeared, what is to be done about
the West Coast Main Line?

THE best thing that can be said about the initiative launched
yesterday by our Education Minister Raymond Robertson to encourage local
authority schools to embrace the opting-out ideal is that it will not
involve coercion. Mr Robertson emphasised that there would be no
compulsion, something which John Major is not ruling out south of the
Border. In Scotland self-governing status -- under which
parent-dominated boards of management-run schools, funded directly by
the Scottish Office -- remains all but an ideal.
Because of the lead times involved in attaining self-governing status
-- about 18 months -- it seems that Dornoch Academy will be joined by
only one other school, St Mary's Episcopalian primary in Dunblane, as
the baubles in the opting-out crown this side of the General Election.
That in itself will probably be enough to put off any parents aspiring
to a seat on a board of management, given that Labour's policy in
Scotland -- as far as we can tell -- is to return such schools to local
authority control.   Uncertainty is the key and it is already playing
its part, as the Scottish School Board Association has confirmed. It has
had 15 inquiries from its members since it told them about the
opting-out options. But there is little comfort for the Government in
this, because those parents requesting more information have done so out
of concern for education after local government reform. This has been
the problem all along for the Government. Not one opting-out ballot has
taken place because parents want to manage their children's school --
the reason for the legislation. Over the years parents have seized on it
to block local authority plans for their children's schools, whether
closure or a change in status. The only exceptions have been the bizarre
and utterly misguided attempt to establish a Muslim primary in Glasgow,
and the Renfrewshire Tory plot to opt Paisley Grammar out. Both failed,
as have all other reactive self-governing campaigns with the exception
of Dornoch and St Mary's. And it is no use Mr Robertson looking to
England as the way ahead. There, opting out has slowed to a trickle.
Only a fraction of the Government's predicted figures has been met.
Wisely, Mr Robertson has chosen not to set targets. The consequences
would be too embarrassing.

LONG anticipated but highly welcome, the cut in German interest rates,
a half-percentage point, arrived yesterday. It may not have had an
immediate galvanic effect on markets but its significance is not to be
denied. The bank noted that various factors had allowed it to change its
stance, and these were valid enough, but an underlying consideration was
the relatively high cost of money keeping the mark far too highly valued
for the comfort of German industry. Germanys is a great exporting
economy, but cheaper sterling and far cheaper lire were great for the
competing British and Italian engineering industries (the latter being a
particularly keen competitor in areas the Germans used to dominate, like
the surprisingly large market for sophisticated machinery in the EU's
large wine-making industry).
The change will weaken the mark and so help German exporters
everywhere. It will certainly make it somewhat harder for British
exporters to sell into the German market, our best, but the main
significance of the change from the British point of view is that it
further reduces the pressures on the Chancellor to raise UK interest
rates, though the CBI, like the Bank of England, still expects a further
small increase, especially if the Chancellor chooses to reduce income
tax in November. In fact the actual published data have continued to
confound the pessimists' case for another UK rate hike, even a very
small one, which is all that is being asked for now. It could probably
be avoided altogether, though it remains to be seen whether the cash
which Lloyds Bank used to buy out savers and borrowers alike at the
Cheltenham and Gloucester building society, and is now in their hands,
is more spent than saved.
Of course there remains the risk that cheaper money generally, the
building society payouts (with Abbey's National Provincial and the
Halifax Leeds cash still in the pipeline), and tax cuts as well, will
all come together at once and produce the sort of short-term flash which
could be so damaging. But there are good reasons on the other side
including the stagnant housing market, the large pool of unemployed, and
the deflationary sentiment so prevalent. The Chancellor will want to be
careful but there is no doubt that his room for manoeuvre has been
widened by Frankfurt.

<HEADLINE>Ombudsman critical of Scottish officials. MP demands names after verdict on M8 public inquiry</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>8</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976715866</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Scottish Office officials were found guilty yesterday by the
Parliamentary Ombudsman of ''significant maladministration'' in handling
part of the public inquiry for the M8 extension near Edinburgh, the
biggest design and build contract in Britain, which cost #39m.
The findings have led to Edinburgh Central MP Alistair Darling taking
the unprecedented step of calling for a ban on those officials taking
part in an inquiry into plans for a second road bridge across the Forth.
Mr Darling said he would be writing to Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth to find out the names of those involved in the inquiry, held
three years ago. He claimed they were involved in deception and had had
their credibility severely undermined.
He added that Scottish Office Roads Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton had serious questions to answer on what role he played
in events. Lord James said last night he believed Mr Darling's comments
to be ''over the top''.
The 25-page Ombudsman's report states that the Government withheld
significant information from a local amenity group involved in the
inquiry.
In one example cited, a senior Scottish Office project manager wrote a
note on possible traffic levels caused by a second Forth road bridge
plan but advised it would be time-consuming and not very constructive to
seek the views of ''unelected pressure groups'' in addition to the local
councils, police, and enterprise companies whom they were asked to
consult.
He added that the amenity group, the Cockburn Association, which
protested about the plans, should be kept in the dark.
Mr Darling registered a complaint with the Parliamentary Ombudsman on
behalf of the association on the grounds that the Scottish Office had
withheld information from the public local inquiry into the proposed
route for the M8 extension.
The association said that, if it had had that information, which
centred on plans for a second road bridge across the Forth, it would
have sought a postponement of the inquiry so that it could examine the
details.
Mr Terry Levinthal, secretary of the association, accepted it was now
too late to stop the road opening and admitted his group would receive
only satisfaction from the Ombudsman's findings.
Mr Levinthal said: ''We are glad that the Ombudsman has recognised
that the Scottish Office were not very forthcoming with important and
necessary information at the inquiry and were verging on unacceptable
secrecy.''
Mr Darling, a long-time campaigner against the second Forth road
bridge, described the Ombudsman's report as a ''damning indictment'' of
the way in which Scottish Office officials conducted themselves during
the inquiry.
''The Ombudsman has found that Scottish Office officials and Ministers
deliberately suppressed information with regard to the proposed second
Forth road bridge, in order to keep the Cockburn Association in the
dark,'' said Mr Darling.
The report states that the publication of the Scottish Office
consultative document on the possibility of a second bridge across the
Forth was issued only three weeks after the end of the inquiry.
It was the Cockburn Association's view that the proposals contained in
this document would have seriously affected the case justifying the M8
extension and that this document was deliberately concealed.
The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint from the association about
alleged wilful concealment but stated she had ''serious misgivings''
about the reasons given by the Scottish Office for not disclosing
information about the bridge plans.
Mr Darling said: ''I shall be writing to Scots Secretary Michael
Forsyth to find out the names of officials and Ministers who were party
to this deception and to explain what action is to be taken against
them.
''The Ombudsman's report has uncovered a quite scandalous situation
where officials and Ministers were quite prepared to conceal information
in order to get their way.
''The public will be appalled that officials and Ministers were
prepared to withhold information at a public inquiry. The report is a
damning indictment in the way in which the Scottish Office is run.''
Mr Darling went on to say there was a cohort of builders in the
Scottish Office whose ideas had not moved since the 1960s. He said there
was no legal action that could be taken against those involved but felt
the public should be given details of who was prepared to suppress
crucial information.
Lord James Douglas Hamilton last night hit back at the criticism but
admitted that the report did criticise the department on one detailed
point relating to consultation and that was being addressed urgently.
Regarding consultation on a second bridge over the Forth, he said he
felt the Scottish Office action had been altogether appropriate.

THERE is an unpleasant odour of political horse-trading hovering
around the trial, sentencing, and expulsion of US human rights activist
Harry Wu from China. This involves some high-flown policies and people,
including President Clinton's faltering China policy, China's attempts
to prevent US recognition of Taiwan, and the possible visit of Hillary
Clinton to the UN women's conference in Beijing next week. This is a
heavy load to put on the fragile shoulders of Mr Wu and none of it
should be allowed to disguise the courage and determination which he has
shown in the cause of human rights in China over many years. He had
helped BBC TV make a documentary about the sale of organs from executed
Chinese prisoners.
In a taped interrogation after his arrest he spoke of errors in the
documentary, but the comments hardly seemed voluntary. Thereafter Mr Wu
became a bargaining pawn between the Chinese Government, which was
incensed at the private visit to the United States of Taiwan's President
Lee Teng-hui, and the United States Government which promised to be
tough on Chinese ''dictators'' but which would rather like Mrs Clinton
to visit the Beijing women's conference.   The speed with which Mr Wu
found himself on trial, sentenced to 15 years in jail, and then expelled
is not as baffling as it seems. The trial and sentence had been
accompanied by strong hints from China that the prisoner could be let
free and banished from China at any time. China dealt quickly with Mr Wu
because it wanted to bargain him away in return for a concession from
the US, quite apart from removing an embarrassment. In general terms the
Chinese want Sino-US relations to improve. They want to stop what they
see as a process which will lead to US recognition of the Taiwanese
enemy, and as a down-payment they are prepared to allow Mr Wu to be used
as a promissory note. It is all pretty sordid stuff and we should not
allow it to deflect us from the recognition that Mr Wu is not a foreign
spy but a warrior for human rights in a uniquely difficult and dangerous
field. It is good that he has been released, but not good enough to
allow Mrs Clinton to go to Beijing.

MORE than 40% of islanders who responded to a survey about Sunday
ferries to Lewis and Harris are in favour of their introduction.
Almost 30% said they were for full-scale liberalisation, with shops
and other weekday services in the strongly-Presbyterian islands also
being available on Sundays.
Mr Colin Paterson, chief executive of ferry operator Caledonian
MacBrayne, hailed the results of the survey as ''quite amazing''. He
said CalMac's board would now have to consider the findings.
However, the secretary of the local Lord's Day Observance Society
dismissed the survey, conducted by the Stornoway Gazette and published
yesterday, as ''the rantings of the local press''.
The paper printed a survey form two weeks ago soon after the
introduction of the new Ullapool-to-Stornoway ferry, the Isle of Lewis.
It followed calls for Sunday ferries to be introduced and a comment by
Mr Paterson that he thought ferries could sail to Stornoway on Sundays
by 1997.
Two weeks ago, Mr Calum Maclean, the branch secretary of the LDOS,
dismissed the survey at the annual rally of the society in Stornoway,
and repeated this yesterday, without commenting further.
The Rev Murdo Alex Macleod, of Stornoway Free Church, and the current
Free Church moderator, also would not comment. ''I was away and did not
see the questionnaire nor the results. It would not be fair to
comment,'' he said.
Mr Paterson said ''buses run on Lewis on Sundays, so why not
ferries?''
Of the 275 forms returned and accepted, there were 18 from people who
did not live on Lewis or Harris, and Stornoway Gazette editor Fred
Silver said it showed there was an unexpectedly small gap between those
in favour and those against.

Music
IN the absence of an early nineteenth-century piano on which to
perform Schubert, a Bosendorfer is the next best thing -- at least if
Andras Schiff is playing it and if it is as good as the one on which he
gave the first of his late-night Schubert recitals on Wednesday.
In the big G major Sonata, one of the three great, late works he has
chosen for his series, and in the flowing allegretto from the A minor
Sonata he added as encore, it sounded beautiful, full yet clear in tone,
warm enough to radiate a space as large as the Usher Hall, delicate
enough to create an illusion of intimacy. In left-hand detail, and in
filigree decoration at the top of the keyboard, it responded to
everything Schubert -- and Schiff -- asked of it.
This was important, because it is in exactly those areas of the piano
that Schubert produced some of his most magical effects, and in which
Schiff himself excels. Yet there was nothing that seemed over-prepared
about the performance. Though Schiff was clearly in full command of the
structure of the music, and knew how vital the inclusion of Schubert's
repeated sections were to its spacious overall design, he presented the
sonata with that sense of inquiry that is essential to all great
Schubert playing.
The policies, modulations, and changes of direction thus conveyed a
constant feeling of surprise combined with a sense of unerring progress.
Since these elements lie at the heart of Schubert's piano music Schiff's
was a performance of the utmost perception, captivating in its rhythmic
inflections, rippling runs, subtle balances, soft harmonic messages, yet
aware -- through those sudden awesome swings from hushed pianissimo to
thundering fortissimo -- of the abysses that always lie alongside
Schubert's most limpid streams.

THE latest news last night was all bad for the Press Association, the
UK's national news agency, and it was casting an air of gloom and
despondency in its new London offices.
The PA had just learned that two major newspaper groups -- the Express
and the Mirror -- were discontinuing their contracts and setting up
business with arch rivals UK News, set up two years ago largely to serve
evening newspapers.
At a stroke, 11 newspaper titles, including the Daily Record and the
Sunday Mail, have decided to do without the PA service, established 127
years ago as a co-operative largely for regional and Scottish daily
newspapers.
The subsequent loss of income to PA will be serious. Indeed, last
night there was concern in the new Victoria offices of the news agency
-- most of them moved in only on Monday -- that other daily newspapers
might follow the lead.
PA would not comment on whether this latest development could lead to
job losses.
As a consequence of yesterday's announcement, six daily titles -- the
Daily Express, Daily Record, Daily Mirror, the Independent, Daily Star,
and the Sporting Life -- will switch allegiance. So too will five
Sundays -- the Sunday Mail, Sunday Mirror, Sunday Express, Independent
on Sunday, and the People.
0
Employees at the Leicester headquarters of UK News were jubilant.
They were told that, by January, the service will be expanded to a
seven-day, around-the- clock operation and new bureaux will be created
in London and Glasgow.
However, it is believed that the London operation will employ only
seven specialist journalists and key jobs such as defence might not be
included.
No-one would say how many journalists would be employed by the agency
in Glasgow. However, it seemed likely that it would be based in the
Daily Record's offices.
Mr Charles Wilson, a former editor of The Herald, the Sunday Standard,
the Evening Times, the Times of London, and now an executive with the
Mirror Group, will join the board of UK News.
Last night, he said: ''To prosper in an increasingly aggressive
market-place -- provided it does not dull the competitive edge of their
core products -- newspaper companies can work together to open up
opportunities for new revenue and profit-generating activities.''
Another Mirror group executive Pat Pilton, who will also join the
board of UK News, said that any newspaper joining the UK News operation
in future could look forward to a 40% reduction on the bill currently

The Press Association was clearly unhappy about the development. It
would say only that it looked forward to the day when the Daily Record
and the Daily Express rejoined the fold.

Music
NORMALLY, if you want to hear larger-format chamber compositions --
involving five or six players -- opportunities will be provided by an
existing string quartet who augment their forces with guest players for
the occasion. In many such cases, however authoritative the guest
players, there is an ad-hoc feel to the ensemble, and the music can
suffer.
It was precisely to address this issue that the Raphael Ensemble was
formed 13-years ago; and the advantages of having a permanent five or
six-strong group of musicians, as familiar with their idiom as a
full-time string quartet, were immediately evident yesterday in their
performance of Dvorak's String Sextet.
The consummate technical and musical ease with which the Raphael
Ensemble slipped into the rich, subdued opening of the piece could only
have been achieved by a group of musicians intimately familiar with each
other's playing styles.
Every aspect of their superb performance confirmed their expertise:
the extraordinary rhythmic intensity of the climax of the first
movement, the amiably grumpy tread of the second, the group virtuosity
and panache with which the third movement was dispensed, and the
dazzling playing in the coda of the finale which, as much as anything
else, was a brilliant display of the plumage of this remarkable sextet.
Equally assuredly, they gave a persuasive performance of Bruckner's
String Quintet, although -- for this listener -- it would take more than
even the Raphael Ensemble's expert performance to convince of its
intrinsic merit.

NORMAN Kennedy has contributed, tellingly, to this series before, but
as part of a team. So it was interesting to hear him with the microphone
to himself. An hour of solo unaccompanied singing can be a daunting
prospect.
However, Kennedy is as clued-up on his songs' backgrounds as he is
unfussily adept at singing them, and his introductions -- essentially a
continuation of the story-telling tradition and told with humorous
relish for all his dryly-implied reluctance -- made the time pass all
the more quickly.
A weaver to trade and resident in Vermont, he has kept his rich Doric
brogue by singing to himself as he works. He learned these songs orally
and sings with both a strong sense of rhythm and a feeling for melodies
which hints at some of his sources being fiddlers.
But before his audience got completely carried away with romantic
rural field-research notions, he confessed to sourcing one verse of
Plooman Laddies Are A' The Go while walking down Regent Street during
London's rush hour.

CONSTRUCTION work is at last about to begin on the long-awaited
shopping centre in Buchanan Street in the heart of Glasgow, it was
announced yesterday. The #150m development, on the site beside the Royal
Concert Hall, will be Scotland's biggest city-centre shopping scheme and
is expected to create about 1300 jobs.
As well as a John Lewis department store, the centre will feature a
number of smaller retail units and parking for 2000 cars. It is
scheduled for completion in early 1999, coinciding with Glasgow's Year
as City of Architecture and Design. To reflect the city's
ever-strengthening association with the arts, the development will be
named the Buchanan Galleries.
It is at least seven years since proposals for a shopping centre on
the 10-acre site were first put forward. The revised scheme, which won
full planning consent from Glasgow District Council at the end of June,
is being developed by a joint venture partnership between AMP Asset
Management and Slough Estates. The developers announced yesterday that
they expected work to begin within the next few weeks.
The John Lewis Partnership already has department stores in Edinburgh
and Aberdeen but the Glasgow one will be its biggest in Scotland,
occupying 300,000sq ft of floor space in the 600,000sq ft multi-level
development. The John Lewis store is expected to employ between 600 and
700 staff.
District council leader Councillor Pat Lally said yesterday that the
development would be ''a real boost'' to Glasgow, giving shoppers an
even wider choice of retail outlets in the city centre. ''The design of
the scheme complements the Royal Concert Hall very well and the real
plus is that this whole area of Glasgow will be rejuvenated on the
strength of this prestigious new development,'' he said.
Mr Sandy Cook, director of the AMP/Slough Estates Partnership, said:
''The Buchanan Galleries will serve an estimated 3m shoppers and its
location, in the heart of the city beside bus, train, and underground
stations, will ensure that shoppers are very focused on the city centre.
The remaining demolition will begin shortly and site works will commence
before the end of the year.''
Mr Luke Mayhew, director of research and expansion at the John Lewis
Partnership, said: ''With the Buchanan Galleries, Glasgow's city centre
looks set to become one of the most exciting retail destinations in
Britain.''
For Slough Estates, group managing director Roger Carey said:
''Through our Bredero Properties subsidiary, we have been working
towards the Buchanan Galleries for a number of years. We look forward to
getting the construction work off the ground during the next few
weeks.''
Mr John Whalley, AMP's property investments director, said: ''It is
tremendous to be involved with such a high-profile development which is
sure to capture the imagination of any retailer interested in having a
presence in Scotland.''

THE substitution of Maria del Mar Bonet for the indisposed Chavela
Vargas in the Festival programme may be depriving audiences of the
chance to see a legendary figure from Latin America but there is a
strong case to be made that the replacement concert fits more neatly
into Brian McMaster's carefully assembled music programme.
Her first show tonight occupies the slot that is the home of the long
survey of the Grieg-Duncan collection of folk songs from the North-east
of Scotland, give or take half an hour. For those for whom the
preservation and performance of Scotland's oral tradition is a political
question, the example of Maria del Mar Bonet is a potent one.
She was born in Majorca and moved to Barcelona in her late teens where
she began to perform a repertoire of Mallorcan folk songs as well as her
own compositions. Her immediate popularity with the public only added to
her unpopularity with the Franco regime. In 1968 the censors prohibited
her performance of Que volen aquesta gent? (What do these people
expect?) and her second album was withdrawn from the shops.
Bonet responded by committing herself entirely to working in Catalan,
the banned language, and her repertoire became increasingly political,
including her own songs about life under military oppression.
In time that line has softened, more due to commercial realities and
invitations to collaborate than the change of government in Spain. She
is a renowned interpreter of the songs of Mikis Theodorakis of Greece
and work by Stevie Wonder, George Gershwin, Brazilian Milton Nascimento,
and even The Rolling Stones have featured in her concerts and on her
albums.
However, it is as an interpreter of the music of the Mediterranean
that Bonet is most authoritative, including Turkish tunes, Arab songs
from North Africa, and her popularity and commercial success have
continued to grow during and since Spain's transition to democracy. It
is that repertoire, and particularly the songs on her latest recording,
Salmaia, that will form the concert tonight and on Sunday.
Not only does her career prefigure the recent vogue for world and
ethnic music, but her collaborations with others have been agenda
setting in a world where artistic boundaries are crumbling (most evident
in this Festival in the Sellars/Adams I Was Looking At The Ceiling And
Then I Saw The Sky). Fellow Catalan Miro -- featured artist at the
Festival two years ago -- painted the cover art for her eponymous album
of her own songs and her music is a mainstay of the repertoire of the
Spanish National Dance Company.
Acclaimed Valencian choreographer Nacho Duato began making work to her
music while a dancer with the Netherlands Dance Theatre. When he left
the company to direct -- and revitalise -- the Spanish national company,
he brought with him works like Arenal (seen in Glasgow on the company's
last tour) and a piece based on the title track of her award-winning
1984 album, Jardi Tancat (Walled Garden).
Just as Duato's choreography is demonstrably Spanish, but
international and sophisticated, so Bonet's music has transcended its
folk roots while remaining faithful to her original militant enthusiasm.
On the other hand -- and particularly given the Mediterranean climate
being enjoyed by Festival-goers -- it will be feasible just to relax and
wallow in the authentic Balearic beat.
* Maria del Mar Bonet is at the Festival Theatre tonight at 10.30 and
on Sunday at 8pm.

WEST of Scotland Cricket Club has banned a number of people who its
committee claims were responsible for fighting and disrupting the
Scottish Cup final at Hamilton Crescent in Glasgow on Sunday evening.
Three people were arrested and charged with breach of the peace after
police were called to break up fighting in which innocent spectators
were injured. One young woman required hospital treatment.
In a statement yesterday from the club's solicitors, Brunton Miller,
the club exonerated members of its own club and Drumpellier, the
Coatbridge visitors, who beat West of Scotland in the final.
West of Scotland claimed that the trouble arose among groups of
spectators who were not members of either club.
In its statement, the club said: ''West of Scotland Cricket Club
wishes to express its regret at the appalling behaviour of certain
sections of the crowd attending Sunday's Scottish Cup Final at Hamilton
Crescent and to express its profuse apologies to the innocent spectators
who were injured.
''It is regretted that these ugly scenes marred an otherwise thrilling
cup final contested by both sides in the true spirit of the game.
''West of Scotland's investigations to date indicate that no members
of West or Drumpellier were involved in the violence which broke out and
it is believed that the trouble arose from clashes between a group of
West 'supporters' and a group of young men who were not involved with
either club and appeared to be present for reasons that had nothing to
do with cricket.
''West of Scotland Cricket Club will not tolerate such unacceptable
behaviour and has forthwith banned everyone it believes to have been
involved in the trouble from attending any future games at Hamilton
Crescent.''

THE source of an anonymous donation of #80,000 to help the Glasgow
drugs recovery group, Calton Athletic, was revealed yesterday as the
Robertson Trust, a charitable body created by the Robertson whisky
family of Berwick.
Calton Athletic is using the money to fund a team of 12 to deliver the
message in schools that drugs can kill and create misery. Recovering
addicts have voluntarily been speaking in schools for several years in
an effort to deglamorize the drugs culture but the work was limited
because of lack of funds.
One friend of Calton Athletic, Robbie Coltrane, who is in Glasgow to
work on the Cracker series, said yesterday: ''The money could not be
better spent. Calton's addicts have been through the hell of addiction
and back and the kids will listen to them.''
The recovery group's founder, Mr David Bryce, said: ''The project is
exciting because the work is being done by former addicts and not
figures of authority. That is crucial in making an impact on pupils.
''We are grateful to the Robertson Trust for showing faith in us.''
He added: ''While we struggled for cash, hundreds or even thousands of
Glasgow youngsters drifted into drug addiction. There are now 10,000
injecting drug addicts and deaths are increasing.
On current harm reduction tactics, including clean needle exchanges
and methadone substitution programmes, run by Greater Glasgow Health
Board, Mr Bryce said: ''The message we will be giving the kids is that
there is no safe way to take drugs.''

Opera
WHAT a scorcher. There have been some crack bands on the stage of the
Usher Hall in the first week and a half of this year's Edinburgh
Festival, and there are more to follow in the second half. But, frankly,
they are all going to have to go some to hold a candle to the blazing
performance produced last night by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra
under conductor Donald Runnicles, and a cast of starry soloists in a
night of extracts from Wagner's Ring cycle.
''This is gonna be a good one,'' said one of the players before the
concert. He didn't know the half of it; it may have sounded good to them
from the inside. From the outside it was pretty awesome. There has been
the odd night during the RSNO's regular winter season when they've been
flying and I've commented, on such occasions, that they would hold their
own against any band in the world. That's exactly what they did last
night.
First off was Act Two, Scene Three from Siegfried, with German tenor
Heinz Kruse in the title role, awakening the Valkyrie, Brunnhilde.
Kruse, a wee man with a big voice, was a heldentenor (heroic tenor) to
the life: a bright, hard-voiced tenor with a real edge, cutting across
the vast orchestral accompaniment.
British soprano Jane Eaglen, whom we have seen many times in Scotland
in recent years, and getting better and stronger all the time, here
appeared fully matured as Brunnhilde, soaring effortlessly over the
orchestra.
Only in the second half, which comprised a complete performance of Act
Three of Gotterdammerung -- The Twilight of the Gods -- did we realise
her full potential. Her voice now marries the full power of the Wagner
heroic soprano with all the lyricism we know she possesses. Eaglen's
Brunnhilde never bellowed or brayed. Her relentless momentum towards the
final immolation scene, in which she was overpowering, was gripping.
Last night she gave the performance of her life.
And the lead singers were backed by a superlative cast: three real
stars as the Rhinemaidens -- Janice Watson, Susan Chilcott, and Jane
Owen (the first doubling as Gutrune) -- with Philip Joll as Gunther and
John Tranter (rather yawing) as a villainous Hagen.
I've run hot and cold about conductor Donald Runnicles, but he
presided last night over a performance that was packed with subtleties:
of pace, of texture, and above all, of emotional sway.
As principal trumpeter John Gracie signalled the start of the great
climax in Siegfried's Funeral March, and the augmented battalion of RSNO
brass cut loose, you could see the audience being pinned to their seats.
The orchestra was incandescent. Full stop. Some national asset, eh?

A WITNESS told a court that his head was used to ''chap at the door''
of Largs police station by the constable who had detained him.
Mr Clive Hamilton, 25, was giving evidence at the trial of three
policemen charged with assaulting him early on June 26 in 1993.
Constable James Yair, 33, currently stationed at Ayr, denies
repeatedly striking Mr Hamilton's head against the bonnet of a car, and
later banging his head against the police station door.
Constable Ian Sutherland, from Largs, denies striking Mr Hamilton with
his elbow while he was being charged in the police station.
Assault charges against Constable Colin Davidson of Saltcoats were
dropped during the prosecution case.
Mr Hamilton claimed that, while he was waiting with friends outside
Flannigan's bar in Largs at closing time, Mr Yair was one of four
plainclothes policemen who emerged from a car following an exchange of
words.
Mr Yair, he said, grabbed him by the neck and pinned him across the
front of their car, pushing his face into the bonnet while he handcuffed
him.
He was taken to Largs police station and Mr Yair tried to go in by a
locked side entrance. The policeman knocked first, he said, then: ''My
head was used to chap the police station door.''
Inside, Mr Yair held him chin down to the charge bar, he claimed.
A second constable, he alleged, told him: ''You're Clive Hamilton.
We've been looking for you for ages,'' and continued: ''You like to give
it out. Let's see how you take it.''
Then, said Mr Hamilton: ''He punched us on the side of the face.''
He asked for help from the bar officer, Ian Sutherland, who, he
claimed: ''came round the charge bar, stood beside me, and elbowed me
twice on the side of the face.''
At no time did Mr Yair produce an identity card, claimed Mr Hamilton.
He denied making any obscene gesture to the four casually dressed men as
they drove by in their unmarked Ford Escort, or swearing at them both
before and after they emerged from the car.
The court heard that, following a trial in March last year, Mr
Hamilton had been cleared of breach of the peace and police assault
charges in connection with the incident.
The trial continues.

Washington
BEIJING'S sudden release of Harry Wu, the Chinese dissident who is now
an American citizen, has greatly relieved the White House and the State
Department. It means that despite all the harsh words from Beijing, the
crisis in relations between the two countries has eased.
The president must now decide whether Hillary Clinton should go to
Beijing for the big UN conference on women next month. There was not
much chance that she would as long as Mr Wu was imprisoned.
His release, after first being sentenced to 15 years, makes her trip
to Beijing much more likely.
Harry Wu spent years in prison in China after the ''democracy wall'
episode in the mid-80s, and was then expelled. He became an American
citizen and returned clandestinely to China to help make films on prison
conditions. He was caught on the latest of these expeditions this
summer.
The Americans demanded his release, and China evidently concluded that
it should comply. He was put on a plane for San Francisco this morning.
There are more serious issues between China and the United States.
China is once again threatening Taiwan, for the first time in over 20
years. This is perhaps because Deng Xiao-ping, who was 91 two days ago,
is in his dotage and no longer able to restrain the military.
The perennial crisis in the Straits of Formosa ended when President
Nixon went to Beijing in 1972 and agreed that there was only one China,
a decision that led to the recognition of Beijing and, finally, the
exchange of ambassadors. Now the issue has re-emerged. Taiwan is hinting
that it might proclaim its independence, and China is staging naval
exercises in the straits.
The Americans continue to object to China's abuse of human rights, and
also to its failure to live up to promises to abide by international
rules on copyright, and its continuing failure to open its markets to
American goods.
Against the backdrop of mutual distrust, arguments have flared over
human rights and arms control.
As China sees it, Washington has blocked its entry to the World Trade
Organisation, and complained about sales of arms and nuclear technology
while carrying on its own lucrative arms trade, and also encouraged
anti-Beijing activists in Tibet, Taiwan, and China.

APPLAUSE is as the beating of a gadfly's wing. An audience's
approbration is like dust on the lowermost hem of Genius's shining
raiment (ie, not strictly necessary). These draconian truths are held to
be self-evident by Simon Munnery, formerly an assistant to Alan Parker
Urban Warrior, and now spokesman for the League Against Tedium. The
League Against Tedium is armed with a microphone which fires
laughter-bullets and a jacket that lights up. Cluub Zarathustra is thus
a rigorous exercise in anti-comedy.
In short, if Edgar Allen Poe and Eric Cantona had decided to script a
TV show that was a cross between The Prisoner and Vic Reeves's Big Night
Out, it might be like this. Are you brave enough to endure it?

DELIGHTFULLY described as a black and white comedy this clever little
drama from Zimbabwe's Rooftop Promotions is terrific fun.
Predicated on the play-within-a-play premise of a contemporaneous
version of Strindberg's Miss Julie, exploring racial tensions as well as
class conflict by having Miss Julie as a white ''Rhodie'' and Jean as a
black factory worker, it is an ingenious piece of writing by Steve
Chifuniyse, brilliantly performed by its three-strong cast.
Helge Skoog plays an expat' Swedish director, hilariously interrupting
his actors with patronising advice, wearily watching as they abandon the
text to begin a witty, clever verbal-war about racism, Georgina Godwin
arrogantly contemptuous and Daves Guzha magnificently fiery.

Chris Dobson examines how the counterfeit industry in China can flood
the market with pirate copies of software, such as the acclaimed Windows
95, even before official launch
IGNORE all the ballyhoo surrounding The Rolling Stones ''starting up''
Bill Gates's $1000m marketing campaign for the global launch of Windows
95 -- you can already buy pirated versions for as little as #1.60 in
southern China.
The problem has been traced back to when trial versions of the
upgraded software were made available in a Beta format and given to 1000
dealers in the region at the start of the year to gather feedback to
improve the final product before today's celebrity launch in Seattle.
Pirate copies of Windows 95 hit the streets in Hong Kong almost
immediately, priced at #2.50 for a cartridge, and from #4 to #8 for
CD-Roms, compared with about #65 for the soon-to-be released official
software.
Bootleg versions then emerged on the market across the border in
Guangzhou, in Southern China, which has become notorious as a
manufacturing centre for counterfeit computer software programmes,
CD-Roms and music tapes.
Amanda Young, product manager of Microsoft Hong Kong Ltd, which is
running the official sales programme for Windows 95, said counterfeiting
had become a big problem and that the company was taking it very
seriously.
''At Microsoft Hong Kong we are putting more money and effort than
ever into our anti-piracy efforts,'' Ms Young said. ''This is to protect
not only our market but also to prevent trans-shipment of illegal
products out of the region and into other markets.
''No company wants to invest millions of dollars in product
development and marketing only to have their product stolen from them,
and that, really, is what we're talking about -- theft.''
Valerie Colbourn, vice-president of Business Software Alliance (BSA),
a non-profit trade organisation which counters software piracy around
the world, has already sent a letter to Hong Kong's Customs and Excise
department to demand more manpower to protect Windows 95.
''We are stepping up our enforcement activity in China and in Hong
Kong,'' said Ms Colbourn. ''We are also stepping up our marketing side
and explaining to people why buying a pirated copy is a bad deal.
''We tested 10 pirated versions last week from China and from Hong
Kong and they all had viruses.''
On top of that, Ms Colbourn said the counterfeit versions of the test
product did not come with licence agreements, registration cards or
manuals, and anyone who installed the software could not go to Microsoft
for any kind of technical support if it went wrong.
She said BSA calculated last year that the Asia region alone was
responsible for one-third of the #10 billion losses world-wide due to
counterfeited software.
''This is just an example of the general piracy market,'' Ms Colbourn
said. ''There is a fairly widespread availability of counterfeit CD-Roms
in China which had cyrillic markings on them -- the old Silk Road is
back in action. It is an organised, multi-billion dollar operation.''
But software pirates and their customers face a threat from the very
product they are ripping off, because a function of Windows 95 allows
the company to track down illegal users.
BSA has also sent a private investigation team into China posing as
prospective buyers for laser disc factories to gather information which
will be presented later this month when Chinese and US officials meet in
Beijing to discuss the implementation of the Sino-American Copyright
Agreement.
Ronny Tsang, head of Hong Kong customs' Intellectual Property
Investigation Bureau, said his department had been focusing on Windows
95 since they discovered the first fake versions at the start of the
year.
In a recent raid, officers from the bureau seized 25 pirated copies of
the software at a busy computer complex in Shamshuipo, close to a
tourist shopping district, while his Chinese counterparts have also
confiscated versions in operations in Shanghai, Qingdao and Guangzhou.

Jackson, Wyoming
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton today welcomed China's decision to release
human-rights activist Harry Wu.
White House spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said: ''This action removes an
obstacle to improving relations between the United States and China.''
Wu's arrest on June 19 was a serious impediment to First Lady Hillary
Clinton's serving as honorary chair of a UN women's conference in
Beijing early in next month.
She has made clear her desire to attend but ran into opposition from
within the State Department and some in the White House National
Security Council because of the poor state of Sino-US relations.
Opponents to the trip do not want Washington to appear to be giving in
to the Chinese, particularly after Beijing recalled its ambassador to
the United States when Clinton granted an visa to Taiwan's President Lee
Teng-hui to visit his former university. Wu's arrest added to the
hand-wringing over whether Mrs Clinton should go.
Senate majority leader Bob Dole welcomed Wu's release but said that
Mrs Clinton should still boycott the conference.
''Let us remember that the quick show trial and sentencing of Harry Wu
-- based on a forced confession -- is the most recent and vivid example
of China's continued human rights violations,'' Dole said.
''The US delegation's presence at the conference -- a propaganda
showcase for China -- would make it appear to Beijing that we are
conducting business as usual, the wrong message to send to the
leadership in Beijing.''
Terzano, talking at the Jackson Hole Golf and Tennis club where
Clinton has played often on his Rocky Mountain holiday, said Wu was only
one of a number of considerations that would determine whether Mrs
Clinton should make the trip.
''There are many considerations and you should not portray this as the
only consideration or the top consideration,'' she said.
There were none the less strong indications that Mrs Clinton would
indeed go. The White House was expected to delay an announcement for a
couple of days to avoid a direct link between the trip and Wu's release.
One opportunity for an announcement would come on Saturday when the
Clintons attend ceremonies on the 75th anniversary of the constitutional
amendment granting women the right to vote.
According to contingency plans, the trip would last from September 2
to 8 and also include a stop in Mongolia. Clinton himself has made clear
that if Mrs Clinton went, it would be only to attend the conference and
that she would not be meeting any Chinese government officials.
A few minutes before Wu's release, Madeleine Albright, US ambassador
to the United Nations, denied at a State Department briefing that there
had been a deal with the Chinese whereby Wu would be released to clear
the way for Mrs Clinton's Beijing trip.

Beijing
HARRY WU knows well China's gulag and has devoted his life to
publicising the secretive labour camps even at the risk of death.
Wu, 58, was expelled after being convicted of the capital charge of
espionage.
He spent 19 years being shuttled through the country's sprawling gulag
in the 1960s and 1970s after his initial detention in a radical campaign
against rightists, or those with a bourgeois background.
He was sentenced to education through labour from 1961 to 1964 for
trying to cross the border after he graduated from the Beijing College
of Geology.
Wu, the son of a former bank manager in Shanghai, has said he was
sentenced to life imprisonment for his ''poor attitude'' or refusal to
admit his guilt in 1960 and laboured in state farms, coal mines, and
chemical factories.
In 1985, he won permission to leave China as a visiting scholar to the
University of California. He became a US citizen and launched a crusade
against China's labour camp system.
He returned to China several times between 1991 and 1994 to gather
information on human rights abuses in prisons. The fruits of those trips
were documentaries shown on the US network CBS and by the BBC, shot
surreptitiously after gaining entry to labour camps
Wu returned to China in 1994 to help to make a documentary for the BBC
on the alleged sale of organs from executed prisoners for
transplantation.
His arrest in June as he crossed into China to seek more documentation
won enormous publicity.--Reuter.

THE organisers of Ayr Flower Show moved the show until late August to
assist growers, and were punished by the rain gods yesterday.
The end to the drought, however, did not deter thousands of early
visitors to the show, third biggest in Britain, which continues today
and tomorrow at Rozelle Park.
Councillor Tom Burnett, chairman of the flower show committee, said:
''We have seen entries this year rise to 4000. It is clear that
Scotland's gardeners have triumphed despite difficult growing conditions
this summer and this is reflected in the number and quality of entries
received.
''The change in dates from the beginning to the end of August has also
contributed with entrants having a little more time to bring their
flowers and vegetables to peak condition as a result.
''We are confident that all these factors will produce a show which is
both record breaking and memorable.''
The show also features bands, demonstrations, childrens' attractions,
and a trade section offering plants and equipment.

THE TINKLING wafting round the interior of Glasgow's SECC wasn't the
public address system but the sound of crashing cliches. As Intersection
pulled out from the kerb after a three-year spell in the design
department, 5000 science fiction fans descended on the big red shed,
with scarcely an anorak in sight. Sci-fi aficionados wear their
dress-sense proudly on their sleeve, and this season it seems much more
mythical.
Anoraks are an old idea. Sci-fi style now involves flowing red cloaks,
ruffled shirts, and cobra-head canes; Army ponchos and thigh-length
boots, slinky silver wedding dresses, pirate hats, and Cybermen suits,
for the best in 21st-century fashion. Though on sale, laser guns as side
arms were tightly controlled, as printed under the Warnings and
Admonitions section of the convention guide.
''If you have a costume which includes a weapon of some sort (sword,
gun, laser blaster, then you will have to leave it outside the
convention or you will be requested to leave.'' This is the 53rd World
Science Fiction Convention, and experience has taught them an argument
over L Ron Hubbard could turn nasty if a ray gun is involved.
At the press desk I meet my first type-cast fan. ''Can I have a press
ribbon to go with my other ribbons?'' meekly requested a giant bearded
American, a flourish of coloured ribbons already cascading down the ski
slope of his belly. ''Sure, I'll sell you mine later.'' He walks away
happy. But there is no press ribbon -- just a little paper badge -- and
no ray gun or red cloak either.
To the media science fiction fans were born with red-concentric
circles on their chest -- a target for every barbed comment and cheap
joke. But the subject itself has never been more sexy, particularly on
television, where programmes like The X-Files and Star Trek: The Next
Generation attract universal followings. A man who can see both sides is
author Terry Pratchett.
''People keep banging on about sci-fi fans, but these people are on
holiday -- and on holiday you slob around in an old T-shirt and jeans.
What people just do not appreciate is that on Tuesday these people will
be back at work programming computers and teaching your kids.''
Takushi Nakamura might be a little late for his lectures on Tuesday.
The professor in computer science at Osaka University flew 12,000 miles
to attend the convention. ''I'm a fan of hard technological science
fiction. It's what I love,'' he explained. His friend Charles Adachi is
a fellow fan who was tickled pink when British Airways screened Captain
Scarlett on their flight from Tokyo.
The creator of Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlett, Gerry Anderson, is
just one of a number of Guests Of Honour at Intersection. His talk will
be one of 300 panels spread over the next five days including: Why was
Scotty Scottish? and How to Suppress Fannish Feminism? Rhona Sheffield
might make that one, unless, of course, she passes a powerful magnet.
She and her husband Mike are standing in the Moat House hotel wearing
over 300 badges between them.
''We just collect 'em,'' she explains. ''Mike makes his own as well.''
Mike also makes communication satellites. He talks about a launch last
month at Cape Canaveral which was delayed five weeks after woodpeckers
chipped holes in the fuel tanks' foam insulation.
Space remains his final frontier: ''I would space travel in a
heartbeat if I could, but I just don't know if enough people really
understand the benefits of space research for there to be commercial
flights in my lifetime. I do hope so.''
In the fan-fair which sprawls through the exhibition centre's giant
Hall 4, children are taking another approach to reaching orbit. Giant
inflatable bouncy castles have been erected to entice visitors to the
stands of the cities competing to play host to Worldcon 1998. An
inflatable flying saucer hovers at a little above head height, at one
stall, tempting some fans to try and nut it.
Microsoft -- who else? -- is covering the whole convention on the
Internet and has erected a giant computer screen. Three dozen empty
seats sit in front of it. Social issues, as well as scientific, are
embraced, with Glasgow's Gay Science Fiction Society -- encouraging safe
sex with free condoms -- and at another stall raffled prizes will help
to fund The Samaritans.
In the dealers' room you can buy the entire cast of Star Trek and Star
Wars, Princess Lia costs #25 for a life-size cardboard cut-out. How did
a women that small go up against the empire?
Glaswegian fan Akeel Ahmed didn't need to pay, not for such an
expensive cast. Three years' worth of weekends and a few fellow trekkies
helped him make a 90-minute Star Trek movie. ''It was to inspire a new
generation of fans,'' he says.
A few hours before Craig Charles began filming links as part of
Channel 4's Sci-Fi weekend, author Iain Banks was standing high up on
the steps, clutching a beer and watching the fans mill. Asked about
sci-fi's recent popularity, he said, laughing: ''There is a movement in
sci-fi that feels that it was all so much more fun when the subject was
a total pariah. I think I know how they feel.''

While supporting the principle of care in the community, Sam Galbraith
claims that some patients discharged into society are little more than
prisoners
TO SAY community care is in crisis would be an overstatement. But it
certainly is in serious trouble. The initial high expectation of looking
after people close to their friends and relatives has given way to the
depressing realisation that we have got some of it wrong.
No-one argues with the principle of community care, indeed everyone
supports it. I well remember the elderly patients who were sent into the
acute surgical wards with false diagnoses. Everyone knew they were
social admissions. They were inappropriately placed in hospital.
I also remember going to hospitals for the young, chronic sick and
those with learning disabilities and seeing people who should never have
been there. They were admitted early in life, established in a pattern,
and never got out.
So too with mental illness, although I think to a lesser degree. Many
of their social admissions were handled much better than any current
care in the community.
The move to change all that was soundly based. Alas, it seems to be
going wrong. A growing number of those involved in community care are of
the opinion that, while it is right for the majority of patients, it is
not right for everyone being targeted.
We have now come full circle and, instead of having some people
inappropriately placed in hospitals, we now have some inappropriately
placed in the community.
There is as yet no great overwhelming body of objective knowledge to
support this. There is the current report of the Government's own
advisory committee and some independent organisations. But most of the
concern is generated by the growing body of anecdotal evidence
suggesting that all is not well.
That's one of the problems with community care. It's not being
evaluated properly. It's accepted by too many people that it is ''a good
thing'' and therefore must be pushed irrespective of the consequences.
No-one is allowed to challenge the great new credo.
Recently, when I was having explained to me a great new community-care
masterplan, I asked how its success was to be evaluated. I asked simple
questions like by what criteria success might be judged.
I was staggered to find that no such research was to be undertaken.
There was much shuffling of feet and coughing, but no answers. It seems
community care is ''good'' and, as such, therefore, all its actions must
be good. No questions asked, no objective assessment needed.
There is, of course, the perennial funding problem. It costs much less
to keep a person in hospital than in the community. Is that extra money
available? I doubt it.
People therefore end up either paying for part of their care or just
not having it. These people are lost in the community and, a bit like
the old institutions, ''out of sight, out of mind''. Who cares?
But it's not just the funding issue which bothers me. I think it's now
time to challenge the fundamental principle that community care is the
best form of treatment for all those who are either now getting it or
will get it in the future. Yes, it's right for the majority but the
number for whom it is inappropriate is much greater than we think.
If we are not careful, we will have closed down all our beds and by
the time we realise what has happened it will be too late. There will be
no beds left to look after those who need them. Patients will be
inappropriately placed in the community.
The cases of patients with mental illness have recently been much
publicised. But let's also look at those with learning difficulties. We
are all agreed that for the majority of such people care in the
community is the best option. We are also agreed that those with severe
medical problems have to be looked after in hospital.
But there is also another group that falls into neither category who
are to be placed in the community, but for whom it is not the best
choice. These are people for whom the ordinary community environment is
a hostile place. They have difficulty relating to it and coping with it.
Placing them in a house in Partick is not right. Rather than moulding
them to the environment, they need the environment moulded to them.
Such people need their own community. We need to give them
independent, good conditions within an enclosed environment, an
environment suited to them and not to some theoretical model of
community care. If we continue to place such individuals in the
community, then we will simply have taken them out of institutions and
placed them in community prisons.
Community care is supposed to be about the individual and how best to
look after him or her. In most cases it is. But there is also another
driving force influencing the process and distorting care. It is bed and
hospital closures. Once again we have got ourselves into the position in
care in which a good idea is taken over by administrative and financial
imperatives and begins to lose its way.
It is now time to call a halt, for us to stand back and see just where
we are. No more closing beds and driving people into the community until
we are sure it's right.
We need to evaluate properly what is happening. We can't leave it up
to the occasional report or the good work of charities and other
independent organisations. The Government and the health boards have a
major role to play. Only once we have done this should we move forward.
If we don't get it right this time, we're in danger of blighting the
lives of many, many people. This would be a tragedy because community
care, properly given and properly funded, means that many who were stuck
in institutions can now lead a life of some quality. It's worth waiting
to get it right.

Bearsden.

IF JUST one member of Highland Regional Council had voted differently
in January 1993, the chances are that the Government would not even be
able to offer Dornoch Academy as an example of a self-governing school
in Scotland today, although there are more than 1000 south of the
Border.
But Raymond Robertson's drive for schools to attain self-governing
status was well received in the Royal Burgh on the east coast of
Sutherland yesterday, where they believe opting out has worked and could
work elsewhere. They agree, however, that it could have been very
different.
Dornoch's school board, backed by most local parents, had been
campaigning to have the school upgraded from a two-year to a four-year
secondary. The community had never really recovered from the decision of
the old Sutherland County Council in 1967 to downgrade the Academy from
a six-year school, leaving Golspie as the seat of senior secondary
education in the county. Bora was also downgraded.
As a result, since 1973 pupils from Bonar Bridge and Dornoch have
completed the first two years of secondary school in Dornoch and then
have been bused the 11 miles to Golspie. But in December 1992, Highland
region's education committee voted by 17 to 10 to support the upgrading
to four years, not least because at that time Dornoch with a capacity
for 250 only had 83 pupils, while Golspie was close to its 700 capacity
at 640.
The following month, however, in a robust debate, the full regional
council reversed the decision by 24 votes to 23, with many councillors
believing there were other priorities for educational spending. A second
attempt just more than a month later produced an even larger margin, 27
to 19 as councillors became irritated that Dornoch was refusing to
accept the democratic will of the council.
The greater public debate was to get even more bitter with the
granting of self-governing status to Dornoch. Parental opinion became
utterly polarised between Golspie and Dornoch, suggesting that the
Scottish Education Department had totally underestimated the depth of
feeling left by the 1967 decision. While relations between Dornoch
parents and Highland Regional Council deteriorated into a slanging
match.
Yesterday, as news of Mr Robertson's initiative filtered north, Mrs
Jennifer Cameron, spokeswoman for Dornoch's board of management, was
enthusiastic, but agreed it could have been very different. ''If the
council had given us the four-year upgrading, we would not have opted
out. We made it very clear right from the start the only reason we
wanted away from local government control was because it was the only
way to keep our children in Dornoch.''
To an extent Dornoch is still fighting that battle today. It has only
48 pupils in S1 and S2, about 65% of the total it could expect from its
two feeder primaries at Bonar Bridge and Dornoch, the remainder taking
up Highland region's offer to go to either Tain Royal Academy, just
eight miles away across the Dornoch Bridge, or Golspie.
But things look set to change soon as the Scottish Office is widely
expected to give Dornoch permission to add an S3 in time for next year,
and to go on upgrading. This would mean that pupils currently in their
second year in Dornoch would be the first able to complete their full
six years in Dornoch for more than 20 years.
Jennifer Cameron is convinced this is the key: ''We know because we
have talked to parents, and they make it clear they want to send their
children to Dornoch, but not until they can avoid the trauma of sending
them away at the end of S2. We are currently going through our
consultation procedures for upgrading and there will be a ballot this
term.''
Despite the early difficulties she is now a passionate devotee of
self-government: ''We have had 18 months now. It has been good. We are
delighted with it, and wouldn't want to change back. It works, it is as
simple as that.
''The most tangible thing is financial flexibility. It is not that we
get any more money than anybody else, it is just that we are able to
make very good use of it. We have complete control. The best example is
that we saved #10,000 on the electricity bill just because we have more
careful usage of the existing heating system. Now we have got all that
money to buy more books and computers. We save money on the telephone
system, by getting rid of an expensive system and buying a cheap one.
There are lots of examples like that.
''Lots of schools have been in touch with us, not just those who are
facing closure or the like, schools across the board. And so it makes
sense to set up a unit in the way Mr Robertson has suggested. The more
information the better.''
Mrs Cameron said that one thing the Dornoch parents did not expect was
the hostility from elsewhere, describing it, with heavy irony, as a
character-building experience.
''I didn't know people could be so nasty, although it was only a few.
But it has been very difficult for us. We did it for the children in our
community so it was a terrific shock to find so much attention focused
on us and we didn't have much idea how to deal with it. But we have
learned.
''We have nothing to hide. But there will always be people who are
opposed to us, to what we are doing because it is a Tory policy. We
didn't opt out because it was a Tory policy, that is a burden we have to
carry.''
It is unlikely that Mr Robertson's new unit will spend much time
explaining this last point.

EXPANDING the current output of Gaelic TV is vital in helping to
reverse the centuries-old decline of the language, a news conference was
told yesterday.
The claim was made by Mr Roy Maciver, chairman of CTG (Comataidh
Telebhisein Gaidhlig) when he presented the annual report in Glasgow of
the committee which oversees the expenditure of the Gaelic Television
Fund.
Mr Maciver said Gaelic still was in a fragile state -- the last Census
in 1991 identified about 60,000 Gaelic speakers in Scotland.
TV had a major role to play in improving the language's future
prospects, he said.
Market research by System Three (Scotland) had shown that most viewers
felt that having Gaelic programmes on TV was helping the survival of the
language, which the same viewers considered an important part of
Scotland's heritage.
However, Mr Maciver said the 1994-95 financial year had not been one
of uninterrupted progress. The Government had reduced CTG's annual
budget from #9.5m to #8.74m.
Mr Maciver said: ''This caused severe disruption to our development
and production schedules. A particularly disappointing effect of the
funding cutback was that we were unable with the reduced cash at our
disposal to meet our target of investing 25% of our total production
budget in programmes made by independent producers.
''The inevitable result has been that independent production companies
have been receiving fewer funded commissions from broadcasters.''
Some of the Gaelic independents have been vocal recently in
criticising CTG for cutting the number of commissions to them.
Mr Maciver said he was aware of the view that Gaelic programmes should
be concentrated on a single channel.
''This would have a number of advantages. For instance, it would
enable us to plan a proper programme schedule which would provide Gaelic
speakers with a balance between news, current affairs, documentaries,
drama, and music, which is currently difficult to achieve.
''But such an approach would have its down side too. We feel that it
would almost certainly result in our losing many viewers, who, while not
Gaelic speaking, are in the habit of tuning in to the programmes which
we finance.
''And, despite progress of recent years, Gaelic is still in so fragile
a state that, for the moment anyway, we need to reach out to this wider
audience as effectively as possible.''
0 On Gaelic TV's contribution to the economy of the Highlands, Mr
Maciver said: ''Several hundred people are now working on Gaelic TV as
producers, directors, technicians, and the like. This will continue to
be the case.''

IT'S 9.30 on a Wednesday morning and Jane Root, chairperson of this
year's Edinburgh International Television Festival, answers your phone
call in her London office. ''Wait a minute,'' she says. ''Let me just
turn the television down.'' It's 9.30am and this woman is watching
television? In her office? This surely is above and beyond the call of
duty.
The fact is that Jane Root is a media junkie. She buys newspapers and
magazines like there's no tomorrow; she watches television all night
till the picture of the Queen comes up. And what she doesn't catch on
the night, she videos and watches the next day. At 9.30am. In her
office.
So how does a former Guardian journalist and now joint managing
director of Wall To Wall Television, a reasonably successful independent
production company, get to sit in the Big Chair at the EITF?
''Well, I think it's a pretty secret process -- a bit like choosing
the Pope,'' she says. ''The festival's executive (10 of the biggest
movers and shakers in the business) get together and they discuss the
thing. I think there's an informal kind of arrangement to share the
chair around; one year it will be someone from the BBC, the next someone
from ITV, and the next someone from the independent sector.
''And then they ring you up and take you out for a drink. Of course,
they don't tell you that they want to make you chairperson. They just
say they want to talk about you being involved in the festival. So I
thought they were just going to ask me to conduct some kind of little
session. Then, when they ask you to chair the whole thing they say
'Don't worry, there's not much work involved in it,' and you believe
them because you're so flattered.''
There is, in fact, a power of work involved. It is not an easy chair.
You have to arrange speakers, themes, speeches . . . the whole
enchilada.
The EITF is probably the most important annual talking shop for
television people in Britain. It is where, after all, in 1993 the dying
Dennis Potter, through his keynote speech in the McTaggart Lecture, made
his blistering attack on the new Birtian Broadcasting Corporation,
likening the director-general to a Dalek, and then going on to savage
Rupert Murdoch.
Potter is, of course, an impossible act to follow even two years later
but the often outspoken Janet Street-Porter, now away from the
straitjacket of mainstream television, might manage to raise a few
hackles in the television establishment with this year's McTaggart. The
former head of BBC youth and entertainments features (and now MD of the
Mirror Group's Live TV cable channel) has chosen as her theme Talent v
Television, which presumably will pose the question: ''Can the creative
side and the business side of television work happily together?''
Well, can they? Jane Root comments: ''I think they can, but Janet
Street-Porter is quite right to open up the question for argument. In
the past 10 years we have seen television become massively centralised.
It used to be a much gentler, more straightforward place where
creativity and television as a culture were regarded more highly.
''I think it has become much more efficient -- and that is good -- but
at the same time there is a real sense that sometimes talent and
creativity get left behind.''
Root's own London-based independent, Wall To Wall, recently expanded
into Scotland. Through it's Glasgow offshoot it made the recent Friday
evening leisure pursuits show, The Big Country, which, is now scheduled
for a second series. In addition, the Scottish end is chasing contracts
for several current affairs programmes and documentaries.
''The thing that we were delighted about in Scotland was that there
were so many talented people up here,'' says Root.
And the downside to working in Scotland? ''I suppose that there's
still quite a lot of work that people in Scotland -- and companies like
ours -- need to do to get national broadcasters, particularly the BBC,
to commission network programmes from outside London. It's still quite a
struggle,'' she explains.
''You want to get a Scottish flavour to everything from current
affairs to cooking and gardening. It isn't easy,'' she adds.
Among the other highlights of the festival, which starts today and
runs until Monday, will be a keynote address by Time Warner's Michael
Fuchs, chairman of both the American entertainment conglomerate's giant
pay-TV network, Home Box Office, and the Warner Music group; and the
long-awaited lecture from Phil Redmond, creator of Grange Hill and
Brookside (he was due to speak at last year's event but had to pull out
through illness).
There will also be discussions about the BBC, political correctness in
TV, and the pros and cons of televising criminal trials. Drama will
feature strongly in this year's sessions with an examination of the
phenomenon of hospital drama and a discussion with comedy scriptwriters
Marks and Gran, and movie directors Antonia Bird and Jon Amiel about
their Hollywood experiences.

THERE are always the purists at the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival
who believe that the quality of the event is somehow adversely affected
by the inclusion of movies made, not for cinema release, but for the
television screen.
These are often the same people who consider the highlight of the
festival to be the latest batch of obscure Guatemalan shorts. Die Hard
fans they ain't. But nowhere in the programme does it say: ''Feature
films only. TV film-makers need not apply.'' It is a celebration, not
just of the cinema, but of the art of making movies.
This is perhaps why our own BBC Scotland has made such an impact at
this year's festival. It has contributed more in 1995 than ever before.
And its entries have been of quite exceptional quality.
Pride of place must go to Small Faces, Gillies Mackinnon's bravely
unfashionable homage to the violent Glasgow of the late 1960s. While the
youth of every other city in Britain wandered about in kaftans and wore
flowers in their hair, Glasgow moved to the beat of a different and
altogether more sinister drum.
It was the age of razor gangs who guarded their respective territories
jealously and thought nothing of slashing and stabbing and then gloating
as the innocence of youth bled in to the gutters.
Mackinnon's movie (a low-budget feature film destined for the cinema
screen, purists take note) has the air of inevitable tragedy coursing
through its veins. There are three young brothers and you know that one
of them is set to be the victim of the film's menacing backdrop. It is
not a whodunnit; it is a who-will-it-be.
They are the MacLeans. Bobby (Steven Duffy) is 18 and not very bright.
He wakes up screaming in the night; he has a violent temper. He reckons
he's a hard man and runs with the local gang to prove it. Then there's
Alan (Joseph McFadden), a gentler, more thoughtful, sensitive lad who
wants to avoid the violence and go to art school. Finally, there's Lex
(Iain Robertson) who's just 13 and torn between his elder siblings. He's
impressionable; he's just a boy. He could go either way.
The boys live with their widowed mother in a South Side tenement.
Their young lives become inextricably linked with the mindless gang
which runs the neighbourhood, led by a sociopathic wideboy, Charlie
Sloan (Garry Sweeney). Involvement is unavoidable as a vicious war
erupts with a rival mob led by Malky Thomson (Kevin McKidd).
The performances from the young actors who play the MacLeans are
remarkable (though what comedian decided to call the wee man Lex
MacLean?), more so when you consider their relative inexperience before
the camera. Mackinnon, with a script from his screenwriting brother
Billy who also produced, has made a very personal, achingly evocative
film about his home town. Bleak, violent, but ultimately uplifting. No
mean feat from no mean city.
Lighten up and cut to Glasgow almost 30 years later. Written and
directed by David Kane, Ruffian Hearts (a TV-movie this time) is a
cheerful and very human film about loving relationships. Of how they
come about, often by chance, occasionally by sheer necessity. Of how
they work and sometimes don't work.
It centres on the lives of eight people, a largely disparate group of
losers and winners whose common denominator is the search for emotional
attachment. Kane's strength is not only in the story (which is charming,
witty, unsentimental, and actually quite thought-provoking) but also in
his characterisations. The people here are often wacky, a bit off-beam,
maybe even a little larger than life, but they remain consumately
believable, well within the realms of possibility.
Ruffian Hearts stars Vicki Mason, Maureen Beattie, Clive Russell, Ewan
Bremner, Peter Mullan, Paul Blair, Bronagh Gallagher, Jenny McCrindle,
and Billy McElhaney. They are all good. A credit to the script.
Finally, there is the latest batch of Tartan Shorts -- the best in the
BBC Scotland/Scottish Film Production Fund project's brief history to
date. Diversity would appear to be the wise order of the day. Each one
is wonderfully different from the other -- and that's surely what a
showcase of talent should be about.
Dancing is a touching little drama from writer-director Stevan Rimkus
about the dying of the light. Sylvia Syms stars as a lonely old woman,
scheduled for the hospice, who has little left in life but her memories
of an earlier romance and her ability to control her own destiny.
The Pen, though essentially a sophisticated comedy sketch, is a witty
piece of social observation. Bill Paterson is a man en route for an
important job interview who boards a train having lost his ballpoint. He
needs it (to fill out his job application) and vainly attempts to borrow
a pen from his fellow passengers. Desperate measures are required as
frustration sets in. Simple yet effective.
And then there is Fridge, written and directed by Peter Mullan in
stark black and white. It is a hard, uncompromising short film which
employs the language of the gutter. For that is where it is set. A
little boy, playing in a tenement back court, gets locked in a discarded
fridge. It is left to a pair of jakies -- hopeless winos -- to rescue
him.
Somehow, in between the verbal abuse and the slugs of Eldorado, they
find the resolve to maintain their efforts. Fridge is probably the
strongest of this potent trio of Tartan Shorts. Mullan is the James
Kelman of Scottish film -- and that is intended as a compliment.
* Small Faces premieres at 8.15 tonight at the Film House. Ruffian
Hearts (6.15pm Saturday at the Film House). Tartan Shorts will be
screened on BBC Scotland early in the New Year.

<HEADLINE>American claims discrimination over failure to win Radio Scotland announcer post. BBC puts accent on voice timbre</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>12</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976715899</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE BBC yesterday denied racially discriminating against an American
who applied for a job as a presentation announcer.
However, it admitted it might be very wary about hiring Scots with
''home-town'' accents from the likes of Aberdeen and Fife.
It also revealed that listeners and viewers complain about announcers
with mid-Atlantic accents and others who cannot pronounce Scottish
placenames.
Mr Paul Vizzini, of East Bowhouse Head, Irvine, claimed he was
racially discriminated against when he unsuccessfully applied for a job
because he had a non-Scottish accent.
At an industrial tribunal in Glasgow yesterday, which Mr Vizzini did
not attend, the BBC denied discrimination.
Mr Ian Aldridge, senior presentation announcer for BBC Radio Scotland,
told the tribunal that he was given 126 audio tapes submitted by
applicants for the presentation announcer vacancies.
He separated these into three piles labelled as: ''Certainly Not;
Possible; Probable''.
The ''Certainly Not'' pile was rejected immediately and he listened
again to the other two piles and then drew up a shortlist for interview
along with his boss, Mr Peter Gourd, head of presentation.
Mr Aldridge told the tribunal the BBC received complaints from
listeners complaining about announcers with American accents and also
other announcers who could not pronounce Scottish placenames.
When asked why he put Mr Vizzini's application in the ''Certainly
Not'' pile, Mr Aldridge stated: ''I though he had no aptitude at all. He
couldn't even read aloud.
''I look for a voice's timbre and for someone who has no articulatory
problems as well as the ability to read out aloud fluently.''
After his rejection, Mr Vizzini wrote to the BBC and asked for a
critique on his audio performance.
Mr Aldridge told the tribunal that he advised Mr Vizzini he should be
looking for a career other than in broadcasting.
He added: ''It is always very difficult giving people a critique of
their voice. Criticising the voice is a very personal thing.
''I try to be as kind as possible but there is really no point in
leading people along.''
Mr Aldridge also told the tribunal that the tapes he listened to had
only the person's name on them and that he had no idea of their race,
colour, nationality or educational background when he made his
selection, which was based on the voice alone.
He said that if everything else was equal between two candidates for a
post, except that one had a Scottish accent, then he would probably hire
the Scot.
However, he said this situation had never arisen in his 17 years
experience of presentation announcing.
Mr Aldridge also pointed out that a Scottish accent could discriminate
against being employed and cited examples of local accents in Aberdeen
and Fife. He said: ''We would be very wary of that simply from the point
of view of clarity.''
Of the three successful candidates for the presentation announcer
vacancies, two were Scottish and the third, Graham Anderson, was
described as having a ''mid-Atlantic and mixture of Irish'' voice.
The tribunal heard that a listener from Edinburgh, had written
complaining about Mr Anderson's accent and asked instead for ''a decent
Scottish voice''.
The tribunal will issue a written decision later.

IT'S all right for athletes to train hard and compete internationally
for gold medals -- but chefs? Surely they should be watching the pots in
their own kitchens, not travelling the world to create elaborate
sculptures in sugar and butter which no-one will eat. The Scottish
Culinary Olympics team captain, Bruce Sangster, in Glasgow for the first
working-together session of the new team who are preparing to compete in
Berlin in 1996, argues differently.
''Everyone seems to imagine that we're on some sort of ego trip and
that all we worry about is how the food looks. But this isn't just a
spectator sport, the food has to taste good too. What we're aiming to do
is work as a team to improve the image of Scotland's culinary profile
internationally,'' Sangster says.
It's 8.30 on a sweltering August evening and the 15-strong team of
chefs are just over the first two hurdles (soup and starter courses).
They are cooking for 150 in the kitchens of Abbey National House in
Glasgow for the first Olympics fund-raising dinner and the main course
of North Sea Cod is next.
Sangster's cool evaporates when he discovers that they are 10 portions
short, and he rushes off to cook another batch.
It's the sort of mistake which would lose many marks in a competition.
Other disasters-on-the-night have been a brand of cheap piping-bags used
for the mashed potatoes which kept bursting; running out of sesame seeds
for coating the quail breasts; and the logistics of working in three
different kitchens -- plus the heat.
But overcoming the obstacles are what Sangster hopes will shape the
team, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and provide the incentive
to win. They have a year to sort things out before Berlin next
September.
''When it comes to this kind of competition the going can get very
tough,'' he says. ''There's five hours of preparation in a glass-fronted
kitchen with judges and public watching our every move. We have to
produce our menu for 150 customers during a service which starts at
11.30am and ends at 2pm.
''What the judges are looking for is not just perfect presentation,
but knife skills, good textures, crispness and crunch as well as
streamlined techniques,'' he says.
While it's true that the Culinary Olympics in its original form was
all show and no tasting, the rules have changed. Now they must cook for
quality and taste. Even cold buffet competitions must now be accompanied
by a tasting plate for the judges.
Sangster, regrets, however, that large hotels no longer support the
decorative art of food sculpture in their restaurants. Carving ice and
butter and blowing hot sugar, as you would blow molten glass, is an
art-form kept alive by a small band of professionals. They do not see it
as a waste of time, since it improves their practical skills of
manipulation and concentration.
Previous Olympic competitors, and past medal winners, chosen for the
main chef's team include Willie Pyke, Compass Catering; Tom McConnell,
from Carlin Maggie's in Kinross; Willie Deans, Scottish Chef of the
Year, Billy Gibb and Graham Buchan. Sponsored by Scottish Enterprise,
Scobie and McIntosh and Falcon Catering, the team's manager is Tony
Jackson, group executive chef of Macdonald Hotels, who is responsible
for all the practical and financial aspects of taking an Olympic team
abroad.
If negotiations go according to plan, this could be the first Olympics
in which the Scottish team will be able to compete as a country rather
than a region. The Scots' request for recognition as a nation is at
present being considered by the World Association of Cooks' Societies
(WACS) and the negotiators -- the Federation of Chefs' Scotland -- are
hoping for a favourable decision before September 1996.
All that remains is for the six-chef team, and their valued back-up
support team, to get into a winning mode. The next time they will work
together will be at the Burrell Collection next month for another
fund-raising, training-session dinner when hopefully the temperature
will be a lot cooler.

<HEADLINE>Churches appeal for a 'just peace' in Bosnia</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>12</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976715901</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN appeal for a ''genuine and just'' peace in Bosnia was made
yesterday by the major Scottish churches and the Muslim community.
The move by the Kirk, the Roman Catholic and Episcopal churches, and
Dr Bashir Maan of the Islamic Centre in Glasgow emerged from a meeting
at the city's Central Mosque.
The meeting agreed that the United Nations' humanitarian and
peace-building agencies must maintain a presence in former Yugoslavia
and that efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement should be stepped
up. The Government was called on to relay this appeal to the UN.
Dr Mann and the Rev Maxwell Craig, general secretary to Action of
Churches Together in Scotland, issued a statement which also called for
reconsideration of the mandate governing UN military operations ''to
ensure that all defenceless citizens are defended''.
The appeal was issued as presbyterian and reformed churches in
Scotland prepared for next week's conference in Edinburgh of the
European area council of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
Nationalism and ethnic cleansing in Europe are among the major issues
on the agenda for the conference, which will include delegates from
former communist bloc countries who are participating in the alliance's
debates for the first time since the fall of the Berlin wall.
Other subjects covered by the conference will include Jewish-Christian
relations in Europe and church issues in Ireland. France's continuation
of nuclear weapon testing is expected to be a late addition to the
agenda.
''Some of the topics reflect many of the major preoccupations in
Europe,'' the Rev Hugh Davidson, convener of the organising committee,
said yesterday at a news conference.
It is eight years since the European members of the alliance met and
Mr Davidson said the enormous and unexpected changes in Europe since
then were bound to influence the mood and content of debates.
Members of the Bosnian National Youth Theatre, who are appearing in
the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, are to be guests of Lothian Regional
Council and the Demarco Foundation at special receptions being held
today and on Sunday.

*SUMMER. It's the time of year when sunny days can tempt even the most
committed, dyed in the wool, couch potatoes to try a little outdoor
exercise.
And with acres of beautiful countryside to explore in Scotland, once
tempted off the sun-lounger, walking is the easiest, most natural form
of exercise to take.
What to wear on your feet for anything but a stroll in the park with
the dog then becomes a consideration, and while training shoes will
suffice on easy terrain and dry weather, anything more adventurous
really requires something more specialised.
A glance in any outdoor shop window these days reveals a dazzling
array of colourful boots -- rather daunting for a first-time buyer who
isn't sure what to look for. Shop staff can be helpful if you go to the
right place, but before venturing over the threshold it's worth arming
yourself with a little knowledge.
That way you can make a more informed decision about a purchase which
will cost you anything up to #100 or more, and you are less likely to be
cajoled into buying a Rolls Royce when a mini will do the job just as
well.
Ten years or so ago, the choice was more limited. If you bought a pair
of walking boots they would be leather, and most likely very rigid,
requiring a ''breaking-in'' period which generally meant sore feet for a
couple of months until the leather became pliable.
Nowadays it's very different. Footwear technology has advanced in
leaps and bounds, and the old plates of meat don't need to be subjected
to a leather coffin assault course.
The era of the fabric boot is with us. Walk into the shop, try a pair
on and it's almost like wearing your favourite slippers. Comfort
straight out of the box is virtually guaranteed, provided you take a
little time over your purchase and get the fit right.
Remember -- walking around on the shop floor is not the same as coping
with a rough track on a hillside. But with that proviso, you'll be
unlucky if you get much trouble from a pair of modern, lightweight
fabric boots.
''Lightweight'' is a key word here, for these boots are just that --
not like lead weights on the end of your legs, just a little heavier
than a pair of everyday city shoes. And in most ranges there are models
specifically for ladies, and sometimes children, too, although parents
will be understandably reluctant to pay a fairly high price for a pair
of boots likely to be outgrown in less than a year.
When fabric boots first came out they leaked like tea bags and were
suitable only for the driest of walking conditions. Consumer demand
changed all that, and you can now buy boots that will keep your feet dry
and warm even in wet weather, thanks to materials like Gore-Tex,
Sympatex, and Aquafoil.
These are ''breathable'' membranes built into the boot construction to
allow moisture from the feet to permeate outwards while keeping water
out. Not all boots have them, and the ones that do are more expensive;
but if you're thinking of taking up walking on a regular basis then the
additional expenditure is worth it.
There's nothing worse than soaking wet feet to spoil a good walk. I
should know, I've suffered from the condition often enough in the past!
Fabric boots are generally constructed from a mixture of suede leather
and woven nylon -- frequently branded Cordura. Even though they may look
remarkably similar, under the surface there are differences, apart from
the inclusion or not of one of the membranes mentioned.
Some boots have a ''firmer'', more supportive feel to them, with a
harder toe-box and rigid sole unit -- better for rougher terrain and
mountain walking. Other models are much more malleable, but while these
may feel easier to wear, bear in mind the purpose to which they will be
put.
Look for a boot with ankle support for the mountains and check the
sole and heel pattern -- do the cleats look deep enough to prevent
slippage on wet grass and muddy paths? Interior padding is another
feature which varies from model to model.
The best advice is to try on several pairs before making a decision.
Take a pair of walking socks to the shop with you, or get the shop to
provide a pair when you are trying on the boots.
Thoroughly inspect the boot construction. Do they look well made? Pull
and prod them about a bit. Test the rigidity of the sole by bending it;
press the toe-box to see how firm it is; look at the eyelets holding the
laces; check that the sole unit is securely bonded to the upper.
All this may take a little time, but in the end it's worth it. And if
the sales assistant seems edgy about the treatment you're meting out, go
somewhere else. Your feet are worth looking after, and you want value
for money from your purchase.
Two more things to bear in mind. Even if your chosen boot has a
membrane, manufacturers usually recommend proofing the suede and fabric
areas with a spray-on or liquid proofing agent for complete
waterproofness.
Finally, fabric boots are not suitable for mountain walking in winter,
when something more robust is required -- leather or plastic.
Popular brand names to look out for among others are: Berghaus
(Scarpa), Karrimor, Line 7, Meindl, Salomon, Merrell and Hi-Tec.

A RESTRAINED but moving service was held in Glasgow yesterday to
remember Mr Neil Golightly, the Scottish aid worker killed in Bosnia
last week.
Colleagues who had travelled from the Balkan republic were among 300
mourners at Broomhill Church to hear tributes to a young man who, the
Rev Bill Ferguson said, died paying ''the penalty of love'' for his
fellow people.
Those at the short ceremony included the aid worker's former
classmates from Glasgow Academy and Strathclyde University, his parents,
Harry, 69, and Helen, 56, of Broomhill, and his sister Karen, 32, who
lives in Aberdeen.
Mr Golightly, 34, was one of two Britons killed when their convoy
truck carrying food parcels ran off a treacherous mountain track high
above Sarajevo on August 14.
Initial Unicef intelligence reported that the lorry, from Phoenix Aid,
the Guildford-based charity of which Mr Golightly was co-founder, spun
out of control on Mount Igman when trying to accelerate to avoid sniper
fire.
However, Phoenix Aid workers who had been in Bosnia with Mr Golightly
said yesterday they believed the vehicle had been travelling without its
lights on to avoid snipers and had crashed in heavy rain on a stretch of
road damaged by shelling.
Mr Golightly, a bachelor, had worked in the former Yugoslavia since
October, 1993, first with Unicef then with his own charity after giving
up his job as a manager for Black and Decker in London.
Unafraid of those with political or military power, he had died
performing work which had become his life's mission, said Mr Ferguson.
He added: ''Television pictures remind us of how grim life is in the
former Yugoslavia and yet, in the last few years, Neil Golightly had
never felt as alive as he did there.
''The work he was involved in brought him into daily contact with a
kind of fear most of us will never encounter. Yet Neil Golightly in no
way saw himself as being any other than an ordinary bloke. There was
nothing gung-ho about him. But many people whose lives were touched by
him came to see that he was an extraordinary young man.''
Mr Golightly had been an active sportsman and ran Strathclyde
University rugby club while studying there. Although he had moved away
from Scotland, he remained close to his family and his greatest pleasure
was to visit his sister and her two daughters, Jennifer, 10, and
Christine, eight, in Aberdeen.
A close friend described him as a kind man who would always be
remembered smiling.
Mr Ferguson made special mention of five aid workers from Phoenix Aid
who had been with Mr Golightly in Bosnia and had come back to Britain
for the service.
In lieu of flowers, Mr Golightly's parents invited the congregation to
make a donation to the group, which will return to Bosnia next week.
One worker said Mr Golightly had been constantly aware of the risks
involved, and described him as ''a pretty fearless, driven guy''.
The funeral of Mr Golightly, a convert to Islam, will be held today at
Glasgow Central Mosque at 2pm.

THE UN and international community must do more to protect aid
organisations in the war zones of the former Yugoslavia, Mr George
Foulkes, Labour's overseas development spokesman, said yesterday, writes
David Steele. The Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley MP was speaking
after the publication of a survey of the principal aid organisations
working in the area. He intends sending copies to the Government, UN,
and European Union with an urgent request to act on its recommendations.
Mr Foulkes said the survey clearly demonstrated that the aid
organisations felt vulnerable and called on the international community
to remember what the soldiers were sent in to do in the first place.

Sarajevo
THE long-awaited withdrawal of British troops from the besieged Muslim
enclave of Gorazde was delayed today because of obstruction by Bosnian
government authorities.
Plans to pull out the 170 men from the Royal Welch Fusiliers by the
end of this month after an arduous six-month operation are unlikely to
succeed, UN officials said.
''We are now 24 hours behind schedule because the government
authorities have not granted us clearance to move,'' said Lieutenant
Colonel Chris Vernon.
''The Bosnians are not physically blocking us, but we don't want to
get to the point where that happens. We want authorisation to move at
both the Sarajevo and the local levels.''
''Contractual'' disputes are common between the UN mission and
Bosnia's warring parties, who regard the organisation as a source of
cash and in-kind contributions.
Although the Bosnian Serbs granted permission for the withdrawal on
Wednesday, problems with the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government
emerged.
The Bosnians are afraid that the departure of peacekeeping troops from
Gorazde gives an indication that the enclave has been abandoned and that
it might persuade Bosnian Serbs to attack.
However, a team of 20 UN Military Observers, together with forward air
controllers will move into the enclave as part of a new plan to protect
the 65,000-strong population with Nato air strikes.
A British convoy of ''low-loader'' flat-bed trucks arrived in Gorazde
to bring out Saxon armoured vehicles.
A second convoy of trucks also arrived to collect equipment and
military stores.
But Lt Col Vernon said they would not attempt to leave the enclave
until clearance was received from the Bosnian authorities.
The UN and the Army were confident that agreement would be reached
''fairly swiftly'' with the Bosnians.
The United States announced it was to resume its peace offensive in
the former Yugoslavia following the death of envoy Robert Frasure.
President Bill Clinton ordered his new negotiating team to return to
Europe on Sunday.
They are expected to meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Paris
before a meeting of the five-nation Contact Group on Tuesday. They will
then travel on to the former Yugoslavia.
British officials believe the peace initiative has only until
mid-September to succeed because the increasingly bad winter weather
will make it much more difficult to reach agreement.
The American plan involves an exchange of territory, the lifting of
sanctions on Serbia for recognition of the states of Bosnia and Croatia,
and the threat of extensive military action if agreements are violated.
In Belgrade, Russian peace envoy Alexander Zotov said he was
optimistic about prospects for peace after meeting Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic.
''I am rather encouraged. I would say that I am leaving this place
rather more optimistic than I was going out of Sarajevo,'' he said.

LORD White, millionaire chairman of Hanson industries and flamboyant
socialite, has died in hospital in Los Angeles.
Lord White, 72, had been fighting for his life in UCLA hospital for
several weeks after collapsing on a flight to America. He had suffered
from lung trouble for some time before falling ill.
His wife, Victoria, 32, was at his bedside when he died.
Lord White, the suave escort of some of the world's most beautiful
women, was the sort of swashbuckling, audacious and daring entrepreneur
adored by Margaret Thatcher.
He was instinctively a shrewd striker of deals, and one of the most
feared corporate predators the world has seen.
It was his extraordinary association and friendship with
fellow-Yorkshireman Lord Hanson in building an industrial conglomerate
employing 80,000 people and worth #10bn, and their reputation as
''corporate raiders'' which led him to world prominence.
But he started his rise to fame with just #3000 in his pocket when he
went to New York in 1973, appalled by Edward Heath's ''ghastly stop-go
policies''. He was soon to be dealing in billions as co-founder of the
Hanson empire.
Lord ''Gordy'' White of Hull, three times married, amassed a personal
fortune estimated between #70m and #100m. Baroness Thatcher made him a
knight in 1979 and a life peer in her resignation honours list.
Lord Hanson paid tribute to his close friend describing him as ''the
architect of the success of Hanson plc''.
He went on: ''He was the leading 'takeover' expert in the world and I
met no businessman, in the USA or UK, with his instinct for opportunity.
He saw challenges which the rest had either missed or just not worked
out.''

GUNMAN John Hemphill, who shot and murdered his ex-girlfriend after
she tried to free herself from him, was jailed for life yesterday.
Miss Sally Cannon, 20, was controlled by Hemphill, 30, after she
became hooked on drugs. She needed him to feed her habit, the High Court
in Glasgow was told.
Miss Cannon abandoned plans to go to college and left home to live
with Hemphill at Kelburn Terrace, Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire.
Her grief-stricken father, Mr John Cannon, 51, told how she turned
from being ''bright and lively'' into a frightened teenager without
hope.
Mr Cannon said: ''He gave her a life of hell and finally murdered her
when she tried to get away from him.''
After Miss Cannon was found shot in the hallway outside her flat,
Hemphill, of Highholm Street, Port Glasgow, cynically visited her
father.
Mr Cannon said: ''He presented me with a posy of flowers and a
sympathy card. But I knew he had killed my daughter. He couldn't look me
in the eye.
''He didn't fool me, or the police, nor thankfully the jury. At least
Sally's life of misery and hell are over now and she is at peace.''
Hemphill was found guilty after a six-day trial of shooting Miss
Cannon three times.
Pathologist Dr Marie Cassidy said Miss Cannon was shot in the mouth
and after staggering upstairs at her home for help was again shot twice
in the back of the head at close range.
After Hemphill was found guilty on Wednesday, he caused uproar in
court and had to be dragged screaming and shouting from the dock by
police.
His brother Christopher Hemphill, 24, who claimed in evidence that he
was with him at the time of the murder, dashed from the courthouse.
Lord Cowie delayed sentencing Hemphill until yesterday.
Hemphill stood silently as the judge passed sentence and then swore at
detectives who had painstakenly built up the evidence that convicted
him.
The judge was told Hemphill had a list of previous convictions for
various offences, including drugs and violence.
Lord Cowie said he had considered making a recommendation as to the
length of time Hemphill should serve in prison but had decided against
it.
A senior detective said: ''This was a good conviction by a jury.
Hemphill is an extremely evil, heartless, and ruthless man.''
Miss Cannon is believed to have been the first woman to have been
murdered by shooting in Scotland.

THE housing charity Shelter Scotland clashed with the Government
yesterday over the conclusions to be drawn from an analysis of
homelessness totals.
Shelter accused Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson of
complacency over his reaction to the figures, while the Minister said
the Scottish Office was giving a high priority to tackling homelessness.
Mr Robertson said the virtual halt in the rise in applications to
councils to be housed was encouraging. He also noted that the numbers in
priority need had fallen and said they had to build on this progress.
However, Shelter said the fact that applications had stabilised at
record levels was nothing to be proud of. Last year alone, more than
43,000 families and single people had applied for help.
Ms Tricia Marwick, Shelter's public affairs officer, claimed the
Minister was showing ''a remarkable degree of complacency about record
homelessness''.
The statistical bulletin on the operation of the Homeless Persons
legislation in Scotland shows that Glasgow, with 14% of all households
in Scotland, accounted for 32% of applicants assessed as homeless or
potentially homeless. The overall total for Scotland was 30,900.

IN A SCENE reminiscent of the ''beer and sandwiches'' visits by trade
union leaders to Downing Street, a smiling STUC delegation yesterday sat
in St Andrew's House exchanging pleasantries with Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth.
As has happened so often in recent weeks, the press corps pinched
themselves at the new virtual reality of life at the Scottish Office and
recalled that the politician who once purged Scottish public life of
people tainted by trade union involvement was now cosying up to his
former enemies.
Mr Forsyth gave the STUC delegation fully two hours of his ministerial
time, allowed them to set the agenda, and then gave a cautious welcome
to 16 of their 24 proposals, including the beefing up of the Scottish
Economic Council, a greater trade union role in training, and his
intervention in rows over the privatisation of the National Engineering
Laboratory at East Kilbride and the threat to the Tate &amp; Lyle refinery
at Greenock.
With Labour nationally declaring an end to the special, privileged
relationship with the unions, yesterday's meeting was a clear indication
that the movement will seek influence wherever it must. For Mr Forsyth,
the show of cordiality was the most significant landmark yet in his
campaign to re-invent himself as a consensus politician.
Among the areas in which he rejected the delegation's pleas were on
the creation of a Scottish Parliament and a Scottish Investment Bank,
initiatives for women and ethnic majorities, greater workplace
democracy, the scrapping of the new water authorities, and hopes for a
more generous public spending round next year, on which he could offer
them cold comfort.
Nevertheless, the Scottish Secretary was upbeat. ''We have had a most
constructive discussion on a wide range of subjects,'' he said, beside
by a beaming STUC general secretary Campbell Christie, who said that
while they had agreed to differ on a number of key issues the
discussions had been cordial and fruitful.
The delegation welcomed the assurance that water and sewerage
reorganisation was not a step towards privatisation, and agreed to
rethink their hostility to private-sector finance for public sector
projects, which remained a worry for them if the implied pay-off was
private operation of hospitals and prisons.
On the beefing up and democratisation of the Scottish Economic
Council, Mr Forsyth said: ''I consider it of vital importance that our
economic and industrial policy should be properly informed by a wide
range of interests and I warmly welcomed the STUC's suggestion.''
On training, he said: ''We need to ensure that our education and
training system supports lifelong learning and to encourage employers to
invest in the skills development of their staff. There is a joint task
here for Government, employers, employees, and trade unions.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson welcomed yesterday's
meeting, saying that it was right for the STUC to seek to influence the
Government in the same way that he had meetings with the CBI. ''The more
we talk in Scotland, the more it is obvious that a new constitutional
settlement is required,'' he said.

A JUDGE yesterday showed mercy to a husband whose wife of 32 years has
been in a coma since he assaulted her six months ago.
Lord Caplan admonished George Sutherland, an unemployed lorry driver,
and told him he did not wish to add to the distress he was already
suffering at the tragic consequences of a relatively minor attack.
The judge was told Sutherland is visiting his wife in hospital every
day.
Sutherland, 50, of Balmwell Avenue, Edinburgh, admitted grabbing and
shaking his 49-year-old wife Christine in their home on February 11 this
year, causing her to fall over a table and strike her head against a
wall.
Mr Scott Brady, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh that
Mrs Sutherland was a hospital worker with a history of heavy drinking.
After the assault, she had a large lump on top of her head but went to
work next day, where she collapsed with what appeared to be a slight
stroke. She refused medical treatment and was taken home.
At about 11pm on February 12, her husband made a 999 call, saying his
wife had suffered a stroke. He later cancelled the ambulance, explaining
that she appeared to be drunk rather than ill.
Another ambulance was called at 3.30am, when she collapsed in a
bedroom. Sutherland told ambulancemen he had hit his wife the previous
night.
She was operated on at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary but is still in a
coma. Doctors took the view that because of brain damage she was in a
persistent vegetative state and unlikely to recover.
Mr Brady said her condition had resulted from the injury caused by her
husband but if she had taken the medical treatment offered at her work
and possibly later when Mr Sutherland first called an ambulance, her
condition might not have been so serious.
The Advocate-depute added that Mrs Sutherland had been drinking vodka
during the day following the incident.
Mr John Beckett, defence counsel, said it was an utterly tragic case
in which the ultimate consequences greatly outweighed the circumstances
of the offence.
Lord Caplan, who stressed that any assault on a woman must be regarded
as serious, deribed it as ''a tragic incident''.
He told the accused: ''You are a man married for 32 years with no
previous convictions and now, at this stage of your life, you find
yourself in the High Court.
''For a relatively minor assault, the consequences have been very
serious. Part of that is the fault of your wife in not taking medical
treatment.''

THE much publicised take-over bid for Partick Thistle Football Club
was shaping up to be less a game of two halves than a one-sided affair
yesterday.
The group of Asian businessmen behind the move repeated their claim
that they had been in touch with the Glasgow club with a serious offer
to buy but the Thistle chairman, Mr Jim Oliver, insisted no businessmen
had approached him.
He said he planned to be at the club's helm for another four years at
least and, to underline his relaxed attitude, the club's majority
shareholder left Glasgow for a long weekend golfing break yesterday
seemingly unimpressed by reports that a firm offer would be made on
Monday.
The consortium behind the takeover, fronted by Glasgow restaurater Mr
Charan Gill and involving Mr Maq Rasul, the owner of the Global video
chain, was due to meet at an undisclosed location in Glasgow last night
to discuss tactics.
It was also confirmed that Glasgow Hillhead Labour MP, Mr George
Galloway, who is said to have acted as go-between for the parties, will
meet Mr Gill today.
Various valuations up to around #2m have been given for Partick
Thistle and the latest Price Waterhouse financial review of Scottish
Clubs, published yesterday, reveals Thistle made a profit of #394,000
last year and had a turnover of #1.7m.
That an approach of sorts had been made was confirmed by Thistle
director Bob McCamley. He said: ''It was mentioned about four or five
weeks ago that somebody wanted to buy the club. It never came up again
and didn't make it to board room level.''
Mr McCamley said: ''The true position is that we know nothing about
it. You must ask if this is a serious bid or someone looking for free
publicity. If you are serious you don't divulge it to the press without
doing any business.''
Mr Rasul refused to comment on whether he was leading the take-over
bid or whether he would become chairman if it succeeded. Mr Gill said
the consortium's intentions were serious.
''Mr Oliver says he has had no approaches, direct or otherwise, from
any businessmen and I would agree with that. However, George Galloway
had a meeting with him and they have talked money,'' he said. ''Terms
were discussed and I wouldn't expect the first meeting to go beyond
that.
''The whole thing is at a very very early stage and perhaps it
shouldn't have been made public so early.''
Mr Gill said his business partners were interested only in outright
ownership of Thistle. ''We wouldn't be interested in just investing in
it.''
He said the attempt to buy the club was not just a financial
proposition but also an attempt to put something back into the
community. ''Partick Thistle is very interesting to us. It is
non-sectarian and that is important. The club is not disliked by anybody
and a lot of people have a soft spot for it.''
Football is increasingly popular amongst Asian youngsters in Scotland.
Coincidentally the first Asian amateur football league, albeit only
five-a-side, is due to kick off in Edinburgh tonight.
Mr Anton Chaudhry, an Edinburgh businessman and one of the organisers
of the league, said a buy-out of Partick Thistle would be popular
amongst the Asian community.
''Just like Scots' kids, football is number one for Asian youngsters.
For my generation, parents wanted you to be a doctor or a lawyer. If you
told your parents you wanted to be a footballer they would have said;
'Are you crazy.'
''Today's youngsters have been brought up here and don't have the same
ties to the culture their parents were brought up in.''
Rangers, for instance, have an 18-year-old Asian, Jas Juttle, on their
books. The Glasgow youngster plays in the reserves.
Across the city, Celtic are also recognising the potential in the
community. Club spokesman Peter McLean said Celtic were involved in
discussions with Glasgow City Council and hoped to set up coaching
classes for Asian youngsters.

A FORMER Army major demoted a sea captain to lance corporal, during an
industrial tribunal in Inverness, yesterday.
The tribunal was told by ex-officer Ronald Sampson, 59, that harbour
master Captain Alex Madden, 55, gave him a ''lance corporal's excuse''
in reply to criticism.
When asked: ''What is that?''
Mr Sampson, now chief executive of Scrabster Harbour Trust, at Thurso,
and one-time chief executive with Falkland Islands Government, replied:
''A weak excuse.''
Mr Madden, a former tanker skipper who is said to have ruled the
Caithness port ''with a rod of iron'', is claiming unfair dismissal from
his #25,000-a-year job. He said he was shocked when Mr Sampson told him
he was not up to performance and would have to resign or be sacked. The
chief executive has denied giving this ultimatum.
Yesterday, Mr Madden agreed that he ''called a spade, a spade'' but
denied being heavy-handed with harbour customers.
However, trust lawyer, Mr Andrew Gibb, said: ''You were like a bull in
a china shop, where harbour business was concerned. You did your own
thing and to hell with everyone else.''
Referring to a confrontation with fishing boat agent Jim Cowie, 45, at
the harbour, Mr Gibb claimed he offended the agent by entering his
office, ''swearing and blinding'', while he was speaking to a skipper.
Mr Madden, now of Culduthel Road, Inverness, replied: ''That sort of
language is quite normal in a fishing port.''
He said he had ''a good, open, modern business relationship'' with the
former trust chairman, Mr John Henderson, who resigned to make an
unsuccessful bid for the new post of chief executive.
Asked by his lawyer, Mr Victor Tough, how he got on with the new
chairman, local laird Geoffrey Minter, 53, he replied: ''It was a more
formal arrangement.''
The tribunal will give its decision later.

<HEADLINE>Farmer fined for cruelty to sheep</HEADLINE>

A CALLOUS sheep farmer who starved some of his flock to death in
freezing weather was fined #1000 yesterday.
He was also described as a liar by the sheriff, who heard that most of
the sheep had severe eye infections and some had bloody pus pouring from
eye sockets.
William McCabe had 145 sheep on his elderly father's property at Myers
Farm, Winchburgh, West Lothian, when SSPCA inspectors arrived in January
last year.
Yesterday, Inspector Jim Cormack gave a harrowing account of the
dreadful condition of the animals.
Four were lying dead in a barn waiting for the knackers lorry to
arrive. About 100 lumbered round the field after him looking for food.
One was completely blind and two were so weak from lack of nourishment
they had to be destroyed immediately.
The inspector said: ''There was a pussy, bloody substance coming from
their eyes. Most of the wool was missing from the body. They should have
been destroyed weeks earlier.''
Mr Cormack also found about 30 sheep in a nearby byre which were in a
slightly better condition. However, he added: ''I would not describe
them as healthy. They were better but not in a healthy condition.''
He told how there was little food on the farm to feed the suffering
animals. ''There was very little feed. About half a bag of concentrated
cereal, six bales of hay, and a couple of dozen round bales of straw.''
McCabe, 40, of Glendevon Park, Winchburgh, denied a charge of wantonly
causing unnecessary suffering.
He told the court the sheep were owned by his wife, Elizabeth, and his
brother was taking care of feeding them. He also claimed he had
inspected the sheep four days earlier and the previous night and found
nothing wrong.
Sheriff Brian Donald found McCabe guilty and told him: ''I simply
don't believe your evidence. It was a series of prevarications and
downright lies.''

THE former Partick Thistle favourite and Scotland player Jimmy
Davidson has been diagnosed as suffering from lung cancer.
Davidson, 69, is to start radio-therapy sessions in a Glasgow
hospital.
His wife, Anna, who is partlydisabled, meanwhile has admitted: ''We
are living near the poverty line and finding it hard to make ends
meet.''
The secretary of Partick, which Davidson served in two capacities for
almost 30 years, is to call on the directors, management, and
supporters' clubs to try to help him.
Davidson, a half-back, who played in Scotland's first World Cup
finals, in Switzerland in 1954, stayed loyal for 16 seasons to Partick.
He turned down offers to move from Firhill to bigger clubs such as
Celtic, Aberdeen, and Newcastle United.
After he ended his playing career in the Highland League with
Inverness Caley, he returned to Firhill and was the Maryhill club's
groundsman for another 13 years.
Earlier this year, before cancer was diagnosed by doctors at Ayr
County Hospital, the Davidsons discovered they had suddenly fallen into
the ''poverty trap''.
The couple, who live in Colthart Drive, Muirkirk, Ayrshire, had #32
per week cut from their weekly income, when Mrs Davidson, 60, reached
pensionable age.
Her #71 weekly invalidity allowance, awarded 13 years earlier when
arthritis forced her to give up her job as a traffic warden in Glasgow,
was replaced by her pension of #39. Her husband gets a total of #90 in
pensions.
Yesterday, she said: ''Our income seems low enough but we have been
told that it is too high for us to get a rebate on the #40 weekly rent
for our council house.''
Davidson, a Lanarkshire miner's son and wartime 14-year-old Bevin Boy
in the pits, earned an average wage of only about #10 per week.
The former Thistle captain, who was capped nine times for Scotland,
said: ''It was a shock to be told I had cancer because I have always
been a fit man. I can do no more than hope for the best.
''But I do worry about where the extra money will come from when I
soon have to go to hospital.''
There is a benevolent fund for former professional footballers who
have hit hard times but it is blocked to older players like Davidson.
Tony Higgins, of the Scottish Professional Footballers Association
explained: ''The fund was established in 1980 and unfortunately payments
cannot legally be made to ex-players whose careers ended before that
year.''
There could, however, be a glimmer of hope.
Mr Robert Reid, 60, secretary to Partick Thistle, said: ''I will make
certain that our board of directors, the club's management and our
federation of seven supporters clubs are all informed of the
situation.''
He added: ''Jimmy was a big, big name here and I was a great admirer
of his play. I have many happy memories of him playing here.''

<TEXT>
A POLICEMAN called to investigate a burglary spent over two hours on
the victim's phone making calls to expensive sex chat lines, a jury
heard yesterday.
A neighbour noticed Constable Paul Hoffman because he was on the phone
for so long, said Alexander Cranbrook, prosecuting, at Southwark Crown
Court.
Mr Hoffman, 36, denies three specimen charges of fraudulently using
telecommunication systems with intent to avoid payment.
Mr Cranbrook said that, in July last year, Mr Hoffman, then stationed
at Shepherd's Bush in west London, was sent to investigate two
burglaries at flats.
The occupant of one flat, Miss Georgina Chignell, had not yet arrived
home. The prosecution allege the officer made nine calls from her flat
to 0898 sex chat lines, then widely advertised in the London area.
It was only two weeks later, when her phone bill arrived and was much
higher than usual, that Miss Chignell realised someone had misused her
phone.
The itemised bill showed the calls had been made to the sex lines
during the time Mr Hoffman had been at the premises.
A neighbour living opposite, who had been preparing his supper when
police arrived, noticed an officer on the phone in Miss Chignell's home.
His attention was drawn to him because he was on the phone for so
long.
Mr Cranbrook told the jury: ''The Crown says that police officer was
this defendant and he was on the phone for so long because he was using
her phone without permission to call those numbers.''
Miss Chignell told the court she had moved into the flat only at the
start of the year and no-one else had a key.
She had arrived home at midnight to discover she had been burgled and
her home was ransacked.
She phoned the police and the next day Mr Hoffman came round and gave
her ''very professional and very helpful advice'' about security and
arranged for her to see crime prevention officers.
The case continues.

<HEADLINE>Experts not asked about Brent Spar</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976715923</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS with the greatest knowledge of conditions at the proposed
dumping site for the Brent Spar oil platform were not consulted about
the plans, it has emerged.
Based at the Scottish Association for Marine Science (Sams), at
Dunstaffnage, near Oban, they take no position on the proposed dumping
but claim that published research omits three extremely important
factors which could have a bearing on the environmental effects, and
want these to be included in the debate over Brent Spar's future.
The platform is at present in a fjord in Norway and, despite claims
that there are plans to dump it next summer, a Shell spokeswoman said
that there was still no decision on what would be done with it.
According to Dr John Gordon, research fellow at Sams: ''We have
studied the Rockall Trough since 1973 but were surprised we were not
asked our views on the proposed dumping of the Spar in this area. The
consultants' report prepared for Shell was sent to us after the event
but it has very little about fish in it. Yet, there is a developing sea
fishery in this area, with catches being landed at west coast ports.
''These fish are to be found at a variety of depths and to say that
there is a cut-off point at 1500 metres is just not correct.''
The proposal, which drew international condemnation following a
high-profile campaign by environmental group Greenpeace, was to dump the
platform on the North Feni Ridge, on the edge of the Rockall Trough, at
a depth of 2400 metres. However, according to Dr Gordon, it also ignored
strong seabed currents which could carry pollutants and there were
questions as to where these would end up.
A Scottish Office spokeswoman said: ''Our position remains unchanged
and we are convinced the impact on fisheries and the marine environment
of dumping the Brent Spar at sea would have been negligible.''

MANAGEMENT at the Asda superstore at Newton Mearns, near Glasgow, are
hopeful that normal service will be resumed today, two days after the
store was banned from selling alcohol because of a licensing blunder.
The ban was imposed by Eastwood licensing officials at midday on
Wednesday after Strathclyde Police reported the store had failed to
declare that a new manager had taken over at the store.
Under the Scottish licensing Act, liquor can be sold by retailers or
by individuals nominated by them who are responsible for the day-to-day
running of the store.
However, if the person is replaced, the licence must be transferred to
the new person within eight weeks of the change.
The blunder means that shoppers are unable to buy alcohol at the store
in Mearns Shopping Centre. However, management at the store are hopeful
that normal service will be resumed some time today.
Ms Jenny Cropper, Asda's public relations manager in Scotland, said
yesterday that the error resulted from a ''a bit of a blip in the
system''. She apologised for any inconvenience suffered by customers.
Mrs Anne Leonard, clerk of the licensing board with Eastwood District
Council, said: ''Business at the store will be back to normal as soon as
I receive a report from police confirming that the applicant for the
drinks licence is fit and proper to hold a licence.
She added: ''This type of error does happen from time to time. Asda
will not be the first business to fall into this trap and it probably
won't be the last.''
Almost two weeks ago, puzzled Asda shoppers in Irvine were left
wandering around the store for almost 20 minutes after staff walked out
because of a misunderstanding over the store's early closing time on a
bank holiday.

SCOTTISH Education Minister Raymond Robertson's crusade to encourage
schools to opt out of local government control got off to a bad start on
its launch yesterday when the headteacher of the last school at which he
taught -- Dumbarton Academy in Strathclyde region -- said neither he nor
his parent body supported self-governing status.
Mr Robertson, ''an unashamed fan of self-governing schools,'' will
visit the secondary today at the beginning of a two-month tour of
Scottish schools to find out why parents and heads are unenthusiastic
about opting out.
At present, only one of Scotland's 2400-plus local authority schools
-- Dornoch Academy in Sutherland -- has opted out.
Dumbarton Academy head Jim MacKenzie said yesterday that, if the
Minister asks him about opting out today, he will tell him about the
resources he receives from the local authority and his lack of
confidence about such levels of support continuing under self-governing
status.
There could be further embarrassment for the Minister if he asks about
another Tory flagship education policy, school boards. Dumbarton Academy
is among the 25% of Scottish schools which do not have a school board.
The board was disestablished two years ago because there were not
enough nominations to fill the parents' places. However, the school,
which has a roll of 820 pupils and 70 adult returners, has a strong,
supportive parent teacher association.
Mr MacKenzie said: ''When the last board existed, parents expressed no
interest whatsoever in opting out. That would be my view too.
''As a head of four years' standing, I have had a tremendous amount of
invaluable advice from colleagues in the local authority directorate. To
imagine me on my own with no-one to turn to for advice would be slightly
more traumatic.
''We receive tremendous support from the local authority. We have a
very strong learning support department, a very high level of technology
in the school, a large orchestra and band, and a creche for the children
of adult returners.
''A worry for all heads is whether funding at these levels would be
maintained.''
Mr Robertson's push, which has the backing of Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth, includes the establishment of ''one-stop shops'' to
give parents and school boards information about the benefits of opting
out.
Mr Robertson said there would be no compulsion in the drive to opt
out. Both he and Mr Forsyth ''passionately believe in parental choice
but we are disappointed that schools have not decided to take the choice
that is in their best interests.''
He blamed vested interests in the Scottish education establishment for
misleading parents about opting out, as well as a lack of advice,
support, and ''hand-holding''.
''I think parents are frightened. They do not understand or appreciate
the advantages of opting out. They think it is a bureaucratic nightmare,
as it probably is, but you would never embark on it on your own.''
Labour spokesperson on Scottish education, Maria Fyfe, who has said
that her party would bring any opted out school under local authority
control, was the subject of an emotional attack from Mr Robertson.
On the parental choice issue, he asked: ''How dare she decide that
Scottish parents are not up to it?''
Mrs Fyfe replied last night: ''It is Scottish parents who have said no
to opting out. Does Raymond Robertson intend to keep asking them until
they say yes?''
Mr Robertson said the Scottish Office would look at all the issues
raised by the Prime Minister yesterday -- when he announced the
intention to set a new agenda for education -- including closing
''failing'' schools.
However, he said that putting ''hit squads'' involving retired
inspectors and business people into ''failing'' schools to decide if
they should close or survive seemed to be a ''peculiarly English
solution''.
The Minister said: ''I would hesitate to say that any school was
failing.'' Certain departments and teachers were failing within schools
but there would be Scottish solutions to Scottish problems.
However, he was happy about standards generally. ''We are getting
better examination results. There is no evidence that our standards are
declining.''
Mr Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the biggest teachers' union, the
Educational Institute of Scotland, said: ''Opting out is unloved and
unwanted by the people of Scotland. It is a tired old policy which has
run out of steam in England and never gained a head of steam in
Scotland.''
Mrs Judith Gillespie, convener of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council,
said: ''People are not merely overlooking opting out or being
misinformed about it. The Tories must learn that parents have made a
positive choice not to go down the opting-out road.''
Mrs Ann Hill, president of the Scottish School Boards' Association,
said the drive was the wrong way forward: ''There is an interest in
opting out but it is deep down somewhere and it is because of
uncertainty about what will happen to education under local government
reform.''

<HEADLINE>Lottery may 'make the poor poorer'</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976715926</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE National Lottery's promise of untold wealth could be making the
poor poorer, two public health experts warned today.
Mr Martin McKee and Mr Franco Sassi, from the health services research
unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the
lottery widened inequalities of income because the poor spent a much
higher proportion of their incomes on the lottery than other social
groups.
Writing in the British Medical Journal, Mr McKee, a reader in public
health medicine, and Mr Sassi, a health economist, said research in
America showed the poor spent more of their income on lottery tickets
than the middle class and sales increased with rising unemployment.
There is an urgent need for more research into the impact of the
lottery in Britain, they write: ''Anything that makes poor people in
Britain even poorer, especially if they do not derive benefits in kind,
becomes an important public health issue.''
Mr McKee and Mr Sassi noted that many believed the lottery would widen
inequalities and drew attention to a comment by the Economist that
lotteries tended to gather money from the poor to be spent on the
amusements of the rich.
They claimed there was ''systematic evidence'' of bias in lottery fund
allocations favouring the wealthiest electoral wards.
Other potential health consequences included the reduction in
donations to medical charities and the social effects of relaxing
controls on gambling.
However, a spokeswoman for Camelot, the lottery organisers, said:
''We've researched this issue very carefully and our research shows that
all sections of society are playing in more or less equal numbers.
''There isn't one socio-economic group paying at the expense of any
other.''
A Heritage Department spokesman said it was ''nonsense'' to suggest
that lottery allocations favoured the rich.

PENAL experts and opposition politicians yesterday joined forces to
pour scorn on a plan to send young offenders to an Army ''glasshouse''
prison, for a taste of tough military discipline.
The Prison Service has confirmed it is holding talks with the Ministry
of Defence over the possibility of sending young offenders to a military
prison.
While the location of the prison is not yet certain, the Military
Corrective Training Centre, in Colchester, Essex, is understood to be
under consideration.
The scheme would go beyond the Government's plans to introduce
American-style ''boot'' camps for young offenders and Mr Paul Cavadino,
chairman of the Penal Affairs Consortium, described the ''glasshouse''
proposal as ludicrous.
''Drills, parades, and inspections may produce better soldiers but all
the evidence shows that such regimes do nothing to reduce further crime
by young offenders,'' he said.
A letter written by Defence Secretary Michael Portillo to Home
Secretary Michael Howard and leaked to the press said: ''The proposal
has much to commend it and I shall certainly give it all possible
backing.''
0 Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said the proposal was a gimmick
designed to earn Mr Howard a warm welcome at the Conservative Party
conference.
''It sounds like yet another wheeze from a desperate politician and
one about which even his own colleagues are sceptical,'' he said.
Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark said: ''The Army should not be
regarded as either a probation office or a depository for the
difficulties of society in general.''
Mr Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National
Association of Probation Officers, said soldiers sent to the camp came
from a disciplined background, in contrast, young offenders would be
unwilling conscripts: ''There will be massive problems of discipline
from day one.''
Liberty, formerly the National Council for Civil Liberties, said it
would consider taking the issue to the European Commission on Human
Rights.
The Scottish Prison Service said yesterday it had no plans to follow
suit, although it would watch the English experience with interest.

LABOUR'S deputy leader, Mr John Prescott, yesterday apologised to Home
Secretary Michael Howard's son, Nick, for suggesting that he kept quiet
about the mix-up when an article by him criticising Mr Tony Blair
mistakenly was attributed to former shadow Cabinet member Bryan Gould.
The stinging attack on Mr Blair's leadership by Nick Howard, 19,
appeared under Mr Gould's name in the London Evening Standard after
apparent confusion over faxes in the newspaper's office. It added weight
to other criticism of Mr Blair's style, embarrassed the Labour party,
and infuriated Mr Gould when he learned of the error.
Mr Prescott said it was inconceivable Mr Howard had not told
Conservative Central Office about the error and accused Tory party
chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney of perpetuating the lie about Mr Gould's
criticism.
Mr Howard's lawyers demanded an apology, insisting that their client,
who had been on holiday with his family in France while waiting to go to
university, had acted promptly to correct the mistake once he learned
what had happened.
The extraordinary episode in which Mr Howard's unsolicited faxed
article was printed as a commissioned piece the Standard was expecting
from Mr Gould did blur the fact that, although Mr Gould praised Mr
Blair, the article included considerable criticism.
In an interview in this weekend's New Statesman and Society magazine,
Mr Gould insists that his enthusiasm for Mr Blair is genuine and says:
''I think Tony, by virtue of his general image and rhetoric, is a more
convincing exponent of almost anything than John Smith or Neil Kinnock
was.''
He adds: ''But this should encourage his advisers to give him his head
more and allow him to be bolder in terms of substance. It's a pity they
can't put into his mouth words of more substance than they have done.''

<HEADLINE>Report will increase pressure for review of taxation on whisky. The dram performs best for economy</HEADLINE>

THE Scotch whisky industry brings much more significant benefits, in
terms of jobs and incomes, to the wider Scottish economy than sectors
like computers, finance, and pharmaceuticals, according to a new report
commissioned by Allied Distillers.
The findings will bring new pressure to bear on the Government to
re-examine what the whisky industry regards as highly discriminatory
taxation of its products.
Allied, one of the three biggest producers of Scotch, asked the Fraser
of Allander Institute to examine its books and independently assess its
impact on the Scottish economy. Allied also asked the institute to
compare that impact with those of other industrial sectors.
The results surprised even the report's author, Mr Jim Stevens, a
seasoned observer of the Scottish industrial scene.
He concludes that whisky employs more than three times as many people,
directly and indirectly, as the computer industry, and more than four
times as many as pharmaceuticals.
On incomes, the report concludes that every extra #1 spent by Allied
on the incomes of its own staff, generates an additional #3.12 in
incomes among the employees of its suppliers. The equivalent multiplier
in electronics is less than half that, at #1.51.
The key difference between whisky and the other sectors is the very
low level of imports used in the distilling and bottling process.
Allied -- and by inference the entire Scotch whisky sector -- fits Mr
Stevens's definition of an industry which brings maximum benefit to the
Scottish economy, as one which both maximises the goods and services it
sources locally, and exports as much of its finished goods as possible.
Of Allied Distillers' total annual expenditure of #153.5m in 1994, 83%
of the #40m primary production spend was made in Scotland. Of the #52m
spent on blending, bottling, and transport, 80% was spent in Scotland.
Only in the #50m administration and sales and marketing budget, does the
Scottish percentage fall dramatically, to 26%.
Every label and packing case Allied uses is sourced from Scottish
suppliers, as are more than 70% of bottles and more than 60% of maize
and wheat. At the other end of the chain, 96% of the 8,500,000 cases of
Scotch whisky Allied produces each year are exported.
Using Allied's own detailed expenditure data and the Government's
input-output statistics, Mr Stevens calculated what he calls each
sector's economic impact factor, the ratio of percentage of product
exported to the percentage of raw materials and other services imported.
Allied's whisky operations emerge with an economic impact factor of
263.2, compared with 214.1 for pharmaceuticals, 105.8 for computers,
102.1 for oil and petrochemicals, 86.1 for banking and finance, 81.8 for
printing and publishing, and 75 for all industrial sectors.
Mr Stevens said the report's findings formed a message which UK and
European policy makers should heed.
Allied's sales and marketing director, Mr Paul Hick, complained of
''insufficient understanding'' in Government circles of his industry's
contribution to the Scots economy.
The findings were seized on by the SNP's business spokesman, Mr Fergus
Ewing, who issued a statement saying ''the dram scam must end now''.
He added: ''Successive Chancellors have shown themselves to be stone
deaf to the industry, resulting in whisky being the most heavily taxed
commodity in the UK.
''To the Government, whisky is just a cash cow. The SNP, and only the
SNP, support a 10% cut in excise duty.''

FEARS are growing that the Osprey, the world's first offshore wave
power station, will not survive the waves that are expected in the north
this weekend as the tail-end of Hurricane Felix heads towards Scotland.
The #4m structure, which was launched on the Clyde in a blaze of
publicity at the beginning of the month, is already sitting on the
seabed about 300 metres offshore from Dounreay.
This follows damage caused over the past two weeks. Osprey's insurers,
London Marine Markets, are currently examining the structure to see if
it is worth saving.
Already the turbines have been removed as a precaution and bits of the
bodywork are continuing to fall off. According to local reports, holes
have appeared above the water line and cracks have been found on welds
below the surface, while some metal panels have come loose and are
flapping about in the water.
The damage was sustained either in transit from the Clyde or on
arrival in the Pentland Firth, a period marked by unusually calm weather
with light winds blowing from the south, leaving the Osprey sheltered.
However, the wind is now expected to swing to the north or north-west,
force six, which would leave Osprey to face the Pentland's notorious
swell. It was hoped that the 75ft structure might be moved to Loch
Eriboll, the sea loch to the west of Dounreay, which served as a naval
anchorage during the Second World War.
Mr Alan Thompson, managing director of the Inverness-based Applied
Research Technology, which developed the Osprey, remained confident that
it would eventually produce electricity. He said: ''We are not
disheartened. We are reviewing the problem at the moment and I do not
want to say any more about it now.''
He ruled out any claim against the builders, the UIE yard at
Clydebank, as he was ''quite happy'' with the workmanship.
The project, which attracted #400,000 of public funding from Europe
and the local enterprise network, has had problems from the start.
Osprey was a day late in leaving the Clyde because one of the tugs
broke down, then it emerged that HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate
had reservations about siting it off Dounreay because of the continued
problems of radioactive contamination at the plant.
The site had been chosen because of the power of the waves in the
firth and because it could feed 275kw into the national grid through the
power lines which were formerly used by Dounreay's reactor, now closed
down.

A DOCTOR has been accused of stealing controlled drugs, including
opium-based diamorphine and Cyclimorph, while working in a Dalbeattie
practice.
Dr Colin Malone, 32, of Rounall Avenue, Dalbeattie, had his case
continued without plea for three weeks at Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court
yesterday.
He is alleged to have pretended to four pharmacists that he required
quantities of diamorphine, Cyclimorph, and pethidine for use in
connection with the treatment of patients in the course of his business
in a doctor's practice at Millisle Clinic, Dalbeattie.
The charge further alleges that he induced the pharmacists at
Blackwood's Pharmacy, High Street, Dalbeattie to supply him with the
controlled drugs and thereafter appropriated them for his own use and
stole them.
The offence is alleged to have taken place between January 1 and April
29 this year.
The schedule attached to the charge alleges that he was supplied with
130 injections of diamorphine, ranging from 5mg to 30mg on 23 occasions
between January 4 and April 29.
He is also alleged to have received 130 injections of Cyclimorph on 26
occasions between the same dates.
In addition, he is accused of receiving 120 injections of pethidine,
ranging between 50 and 100mg,on 11 occasions.

AN Aberdeenshire delivery driver yesterday admitted sending hoax
letter bombs and letters containing death threats to an MP in a campaign
to run the English out of Scotland.
Defence counsel Bill Dunlop told the High Court in Stirling that Kevin
Paton, 27, of Charles Gardens, Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, would now plead
guilty to conspiring with another man -- whom the court was earlier told
was Dublin-based Scottish activist Adam Busby -- to further the cause of
a group called Flame by sending hoax explosive devices and threatening
letters.
Paton admitted taking part in the campaign between April 1 and April
30 last year.
He also admitted posting the devices, which the court earlier heard
were very good imitations of letter bombs, to a series of targets.
Among those who received them were Mr Malcolm Dickson, a Dundee
University lecturer, and Mr Derek Roxborough, 59, a former resident of
Tyneside, who had lived in Wester Ross for 26 years. Both had written to
newspapers criticising a wave of anti-English sentiment that swept
Scotland in 1993 and 1994 which was blamed on the activities of two
groups -- Scottish Watch and Settler Watch.
Also targeted was Mr Terry Penny, a former Grampian regional
councillor, who had proposed a motion urging police to act against
illegal activities by anti-English groups.
Exchange and Mart Magazine in Poole, Dorset, and York-based developers
Persimmon Homes also received fake bombs.
Paton also admitted posting letters to various newspapers, political
parties, and to the Press Association warning Mr Tony Worthington,
Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, that he had 30 days to leave
Scotland or die.
The court heard that the letters and the hoax letter bombs had been
forwarded to Paton by Mr Busby in Dublin.
Paton admitted the plot had been intended to drive English residents
out of Scotland, intimidate people who spoke out against extreme
anti-English views, coerce advertisers not to advertise Scottish
properties for sale south of the Border, and was an attempt to cause
disruption, fear, and alarm.
The plea, which was accepted by the Crown, clears him of involvement
with allegations of the hoax bombing of Aberdeen Sheriff Court and of
involvement with the Scottish National Liberation Army.
After formally finding him guilty, the judge, Lord McCluskey, released
him on bail until today.
During the trial, the jury heard that police who raided Paton's home
found a black balaclava and shirts emblazoned with pro-IRA slogans.
Paton's co-accused, Mr Terence Webber, maintains his plea of not
guilty to involvement in a conspiracy to further the case of Flame and
the Scottish National Liberation Army by making threats, mailing the
fake letter bombs, and placing a hoax bomb outside Aberdeen Sheriff
Court.
His counsel, Mr James Reilly, told the jury that Mr Webber would not
be giving evidence and no evidence would be led on his behalf.
Mr Webber has lodged a special defence of incrimination, saying that
if the offences were committed they were committed by two men not in
court -- Mr Busby and Mr Darrin Brown.
Earlier yesterday , the court was told that letters from Mr Busby were
found in an Aberdeen flat where Mr Brown was said to have built a hoax
bomb later planted outside the town's sheriff court.
Police who raided the flat in Union Grove, Aberdeen, also found two
posters.
One was headed Scottish National Liberation Army and showed a man in
uniform holding an automatic rifle and a rocket launcher.
It also bore the saltire, a lion rampant, and the words ''all peaceful
means have failed''.
The poster and some of the nine letters purportedly signed by Mr Busby
gave the same Dublin address. The second poster was headed Fianna Na
Th'Alba and showed a hooded figure in military uniform holding an
automatic weapon set against a map of Scotland.
The court heard that the letters signed ''Adam Busby'' began ''Dear
Terry''.
Two other letters were addressed to Mr Darrin Brown and signed ''Terry
Webber''.
Detective Constable Macolm Stewart said the one of letters began
''Hello Darrin, ya young thug'' and ended with ''Fianna na th'Alba''.
The other was signed, ''For Scotland, Terry Webber''.
The text of the letters was not revealed.
Mr Stewart said the letters were all found in a plastic bag in the
kitchen of the flat after police burst down the door in a raid the
morning after the bomb alert on September 8 last year.
The bag also contained two photographs -- one showing Mr Brown wearing
a camouflage jacket pictured in hill country, and the other showing an
automatic rifle laid on top of a camouflage jacket with a maroon beret
and a badge.
The jury has been told that the whereabouts of Mr Brown are not now
known.
Lord McCluskey is expected to begin his charge to the jury today after
Mr Webber's counsel and the Advocate-depute Michael O'Grady have
finished their speeches.

ELDERLY people with lung cancer are being denied treatment which could
relieve their symptoms and prolong their lives, a team of doctors have
claimed.
The doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton, Surrey, found
after trials that cancer victims aged over 70 responded to chemotherapy
as well, and in some cases better, than younger patients.
They reported their findings in a letter to The Lancet.
In seven out of eight recent lung cancer chemotherapy trials, patients
over 75 were excluded, the doctors said.
Team leader Dr Ian Smith said there was no longer any justification
for denying chemotherapy treatment on the basis of age.

HOLLYWOOD came to the West End of Edinburgh yesterday when Steve
Martin, the American comedian and actor, launched a charm offensive
against the Scottish media in the Caledonian Hotel.
Martin was last in Edinburgh 25 years ago playing his banjo in a
coffee house in Lothian Road. ''I was 21, and when I got off the train I
found the streets were full of people laughing and drinking and
puking,'' he said. ''I thought -- 'This place is incredible.' But it was
the night of the Scotland and Wales rugby game. I had assumed this
behaviour went on all the time. But the next night -- dead.''
He has returned because A Simple Twist of Fate, directed by Gillies
Mackinnon, which he wrote and stars in, received its British premiere at
the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival. Set in the present day in the
American South it is based on George Eliot's novel, Silas Marner. Why
had he chosen the book? ''I had come to the decision I wanted to do a
movie driven by plot. You can add comedy and flights of fancy because
the subject drives you along. I read the book, analysed it, and
reorganised it a bit -- but that is what we do in the movies.''
The critical reception has been mixed, but Martin charmed the premiere
audience with an impromptu 10-minute comedy spot after the screening.
Yesterday he turned his attention to the media, rashly laying claim, as
visiting Americans always do, to Scottish ancestry. ''I am part
Scottish,'' he said to explain why he felt so at home.
Which part was Scottish?
''I don't know,'' he confessed. ''It is in the mix there -- English,
Scottish, and Irish. I guess there is something in my genes because I
like Scottish music. I have played it for years.''
Such as?
''Mary Black'' he said.
''But she's Irish,'' he was told.
''Well, I like Scottish and Irish music,'' he said hastily.
But if Martin was making the usual suspect protestations about his
origins, the Scottish media were asking the same old questions, like
whether he had yet tried haggis?
''There are certain foods I will not eat, no matter how good they are
or what they look like,'' he said. ''It is based on what they are called
and I guess even squid is included. Haggis is a vegetable dish, right?''
He was told what it contained.
''I don't eat meat,'' he said firmly.
He said he did not think of roles in terms of what people expected him
to do, but of what appealed to him. ''It has never bothered me what
people think,'' he added. ''I choose the subject, start writing or
reading a script, decide on the basis of liking it, and go on from
there. If something is good it will be accepted. The hard part is making
it good.''
The plot involves a dispute between a teenage girl's poor adoptive
parent, played by Martin, and her wealthy natural parent, played by
Gabriel Byrne, over who should have custody.
He said there had been a lot of controversy in America about adoption
and he thought it a very relevant, human story. As to the accuracy of
the court hearing, the film's climax, at which the judgment of Solomon
has to be made, he hedged his bets. ''It could be accurate,'' he said.
''There were a lot of trials like that. One occurred after the screen
play was done which was virtually identical. I believe the foster
parents won and got to keep the child, but a year later she decided to
go back to her natural parents.''
He said he had no idea whether he was an actor or a comedian. He just
did what he did. ''I think films like Father of the Bride and Parenthood
were highly dramatic so in my mind I have been doing drama,'' he added.
''The Jerk, on the other hand, was comedy.''
He has just made a Sergeant Bilko film, having been reluctant for a
long time to take on a role Phil Silvers made his own, but he had liked
the people he would be working with -- Dan Ackroyd and Jonathan Lynn
among them -- and it had all came together. He did not make films just
to fund other films. Every one he had done he had wanted to do.
Apart from Bilko, what else was on its way? There was Father of the
Bride 2, he said. In it his daughter gets pregnant, he felt he was
getting older, dyed his hair, exercised in the gym, and made love to
Diane Keaton, who played his wife, on the kitchen floor.
''She starts feeling funny and thinks it is the menopause, but it
turns out she is pregnant and she and our daughter have their babies on
the same day,'' he added.

SCOTTISHPOWER fears a European or US company could steal Manweb from
under its nose if its hostile bid for the electricity distributor is
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, industry sources
revealed yesterday.
It is believed to be concerned that regulator Professor Stephen
Littlechild will err on the side of caution and recommend a monopolies
inquiry into its #1000m bid for the Chester-based company.
Manweb, which has described ScottishPower's offer as ''mean'', made no
great play of its wish for independence in its defence document,
published on Monday. Industry insiders say this omission is tantamount
to putting up a ''for sale'' sign or issuing a prospectus.
If ScottishPower's offer were removed from the table for three months
during an MMC probe, Manweb might be receptive to a higher bid from a
''white knight'' from Europe or the US.
After ScottishPower had done all the groundwork, a rival would be able
to step in and clinch the deal at a slightly higher price.
A bid by a major Continental European utility would be considered
exclusively by Brussels, not the MMC, provided its turnover, added to
that of Manweb, exceeded 5000 million ecu (#4100m).
Unlike the UK authorities, the European Commission would not look at
public interest questions such as pricing policy. It would be likely to
judge the bid only on its potential impact on competition -- a situation
which would give a European utility what could be considered an unfair
advantage over ScottishPower.
The EC could clear the bid within a month. Alternatively, it could
instigate second-stage proceedings, which would take up to three months.
If Southern Co of the US has its hostile bid for South Western
Electricity cleared and ScottishPower's offer for Manweb is referred,
the way would appear to be clear for another cash-rich US company to bid
for Manweb.
There is a feeling that ScottishPower's bid could be in more danger of
referral than Southern's, or the agreed offer by Hanson for Eastern
Group, because it involves two UK electricity companies.
However, there would appear to be little rationale for singling out
ScottishPower for referral.
Chief executive Ian Robinson, who sees no grounds for an MMC referral,
said yesterday: ''We only want to be judged on a level playing field.''
Even if a white knight did scupper ScottishPower's offer, the
Glasgow-based utility would be able to offload the substantial
shareholding it has built up in Manweb at a premium. ScottishPower
currently owns 14.9% of Manweb.
The first deadline for Manweb shareholders to accept ScottishPower's
offer comes on Tuesday. An announcement regarding the level of
acceptances secured is expected the following day.
With ScottishPower's shares having advanced strongly, the value of its
shares-plus-cash offer has risen from 945p to 977p since the bid was
announced on July 24.
Manweb shares, unchanged at 887p yesterday, continue to trade well
below the value of ScottishPower's 915p cash alternative.
After the Office of Fair Trading has considered Professor
Littlechild's views, it will make a recommendation on whether
ScottishPower's bid should be referred.
President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang is expected to announce the
decision within the next two weeks.

WEST of Scotland households face increased water bills of 15% next
year and up to 40% on average the following year.
The admission by Mr John Jameson, the chairman of the area's new water
authority provoked an immediate, and warning response from the head of
the Scottish watchdog body.
An estimated 1.2 million households could now face at least five years
of sustained increases in water and sewerage charges.
Mr Jameson's statement came the day after the new East of Scotland
Water Authority said it planned to fund a #300m spending gap between
existing budgets and the cost of new projects through a combination of
private finance and increased charges.
The chairman of the Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers' Council, Mr
Dick Douglas, said the new water authorities would ''have a hard job''
justifying the level of increased charges currently being considered.
''It seems they want to give their own impression on the state of the
Scottish water industry that they are inheriting. It is all part of the
softening-up process and I await their justification for these charges
with interest,'' said Mr Douglas.
The issue has also provoked a strong response from the public.
Yesterday the police had to clear the public from the inaugural meeting
of the West of Scotland Water Authority board because of rowdy protests
over the removal of water and sewerage services from local authority
control.
After one member of the Hands off Scottish Water Campaign accused the
board of behaving like members of a ''quasi-masonic'' cult, another
protester shouted: ''We're not here to do as we're told. We are here to
let you know what we think.'' Mr Jameson adjourned the meeting and
called for the police to eject the public.
The leader of the Labour administration of Strathclyde Regional
Council, Councillor Robert Gould, said the increases were the result of
local government reorganisation and taking water services out of local
authority control.
He predicted ''tremendous hardship'' for people who had no financial
flexibility.
Councillor Des McNulty, chairman of Strathclyde region's
reorganisation committee and the councillor responsible for organising
the council's water referendum, said: ''What we are seeing now is the
price of the Government's inaction in terms of water investment for the
past 16 to 17 years.''
After the protest yesterday, Councillor Christopher Mason, the leader
of Strathclyde's Liberal Democrat group, told Mr Jameson he had ''no
right to treat members of the public in this way.''
He added: ''If this new quango wants to hold meetings like this, which
abuse all democratic traditions, it should hire a hotel room and not the
promises of Strathclyde Regional Council.''
Mr Jameson said he was saddened that members of the public had been
debarred due to the actions of those ''whose only agenda was to
disrupt''.
He told a reconvened meeting that the prime objective of the new
authority, which takes over control of water and sewerage services from
Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway Regional councils next April, was
to provide a high quality service to the West of Scotland ''at the
lowest possible cost''.
However, planned spending of #100m on improved water and sewerage
treatment plants in the first year would rise to #180m by 2001. This
would create a spending package in excess of #600m in the first five
years of the new authority's existence.
Mr Jameson said the capital expenditure was necessary to meet strict
Government and EU requirements and the authority had to produce a budget
to meet these spending needs by the end of October.
Funding shortfalls would be met through a combination of private
finance and increased water charges.
Mr Jameson said he expected initial water and sewerage charge
increases to be between 10% and 15%, with a peak being reached after
five years, but increases would be likely to continue for 10 years.
The proposed level of increase is well above the 9% rise in this
year's water charges in Strathclyde and the standstill on charges in
Dumfries and Galloway.
Calculations by The Herald reveal that an increase of 15% would lead
to water and sewerage charges for a Council Tax Band D household rising
from an average of #95 in Dumfries and Galloway and Strathclyde to
approximately #109 in 1996/97, and with sustained rises to #135 by 1998.
Mr Jameson said he hoped the board would find a number of ways to
mitigate the increase and keep charge increases proportionally below the
level of expenditure.
These strategies would include private marketing of the water
authority's services to Third World countries and the selling of water
to countries such as Spain.
Councillor McNulty said: ''The cost to the consumer would have been
much less if the Government had allowed Strathclyde region to invest in
water and sewerage at a much earlier stage.''
He said the Government's private finance initiative for the new water
authorities had been shown, in a report by the Chemical Bank for
Strathclyde region, to cost more than 50% than the standard methods of
local authority finance borrowing in the public sector.
''The increased financial imposition on the consumer in the West of
Scotland is because of the Government's political preference for private
finance. If local government had continued to control water services it
would have been able to borrow this money at 50% less than the private
institutions that the new authorities will have to go to.
''South of the Border, the private companies in the water industry
have basically been investing not in water but in paying huge dividends
to shareholders and substantial salaries to directors.
''We are not going to have that in Scotland. But we are going to have
a situation where the water industry and sewerage requirements of the
people in the West of Scotland are not going to be met in the cheapest
possible way,'' he said.
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, said: ''The new
water quangos have now admitted that water bills are set to soar. This
confirms what Labour have been saying all along.''
The Scottish National Party's vice-president, Angus East MP Andrew
Welsh, said: ''The costly quangoisation is propelling a 'tap tax' on
Scots who will bitterly resent paying for quangos they did not
support.''
Meanwhile the leader of England's water chiefs was accused last night
of ''double standards'' as the controversy over drought compensation
intensified.
Mr Nicholas Hood, head of the Water Services Association trade body
and of Wessex Water, came under fire after failing to urge all water
companies to follow his firm's lead and compensate customers banned from
using hosepipes.
Shadow Consumer Minister Nigel Griffiths said Mr Hood was letting
consumers down badly by not putting pressure on his counterparts at the
other nine major water firms.
The attack was launched as Environment Secretary John Gummer called
for an urgent report on water resources and the adequacy of the measures
being taken.

THE Royal Scottish National Orchestra is to collect #50,000 next
spring for staging four concerts to mark ''the passing'' of Glasgow
District Council.
Opposition members tried to block the expenditure yesterday when the
commission was approved by the council's finance committee.
The orchestra receives #150,000 from the council in an annual grant.
SNP councillor Ken Gibson told the committee: ''Labour talks of the
pressure to increase the council tax and here they are planning to give
the Royal SNO extra help.''
He said it was highly unlikely that ordinary members of the public
would approve of such a project. The city, he said, was fast acquiring
the image of ''fur coats and no knickers''.
He added: ''If the orchestra is short of money then it should come to
the council in the normal way rather than us cooking up this wheeze of
special concerts.''
Councillor John Young, Tory leader, said he was puzzled at how a
Labour administration could justify the project. ''The Labour Party in
Scotland was against any change in local government -- why are you now
wanting to celebrate it?''
Labour councillor Gordon Macdiarmid, the city treasurer, said the
concerts would mark the transition as the new authority assumed power
next spring from the district council.
Blocks of tickets, he said, would be bought using public funds and the
seats made available to local people who could not normally attend such
concerts. ''I think it's an excellent idea,'' he said. A move to take
''no action'' by four opposition councillors was voted down
overwhelmingly by the ruling Labour bloc.

A ''despicable'' lawyer who preyed on elderly clients and used
#300,000 of their money for himself, has been struck off by the Scottish
Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal.
Fife solicitor David Hoey took nearly #100,000 from one of his
victims, a 91-year-old woman, and the tribunal described the case as one
of the most deplorable ever to come before it.
In a separate case, the tribunal also struck off Banffshire solicitor
Robert Sneddon for embezzling #15,000 which a client had left in his
will for cancer charities.
In a written decision issued yesterday, the tribunal said that Mr
Hoey, of Ernsdyke, Links Road, Leven, Fife, had been a partner in the
Leven-based firm of Smith and Grant.
In one case, he travelled to a hospice to execute the will of a
71-year-old client a few days before she died. The residue of the
woman's estate was left to a cousin who did not exist, the money was
paid into a bank account in Mr Hoey's name and #19,700 was defrauded
from the woman's estate.
The 91-year-old woman executed a power of attorney in Mr Hoey's
favour, and between August 1990 and February 1992, he used #23,500 of
her money for his own benefit.
Between November 1990 and March 1993, he used #76,647 of the woman's
cash for what the tribunal described as ''personal speculative property
transactions''.
In all, eight elderly clients were cheated out of sums ranging from
nearly #100,000 to #7500.
The tribunal said that the solicitor had defrauded numerous clients by
creating fictitious beneficiaries when framing and having wills
executed, and repeatedly using the money for his own ends.
''This tribunal always finds dishonesty on the part of a solicitor to
be a serious matter, but in this case Mr Hoey's conduct was particularly
despicable.
''The circumstances are some of the most deplorable to have ever come
before this tribunal and, unhesitatingly, the tribunal directs that the
name of Mr Hoey be struck off the roll (of practising solicitors).''
In the case of Mr Sneddon, the discipline tribunal said he had
practiced on his own at Mid Street, Keith, and Fife Street, Dufftown,
both Grampian, until the firm was taken over in March last year, shortly
before Mr Sneddon went for treatment at an alcohol rehabilitation
programme.
A client who died in 1976 had left a will stipulating that after
payment of several small legacies the rest of his estate was to be
divided between the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation and the Cancer
Research Campaign.
However, no payment was made to either charity and the money was kept
on the firm's books.
Some years later, in 1988 and 1989, Mr Sneddon, of Island Bank Road,
Inverness, withdrew the cash, totalling #15,645, claiming that it was to
cover fees.
The tribunal said that Mr Sneddon had embezzled the money and the
claim about fees was a sham to cover up what he had done. The matter
came to light only after his firm was taken over.
A Crown Office spokesman confirmed yesterday that the cases of both Mr
Hoey and Mr Sneddon were the subject of criminal investigations.

A FEUD between two neighbouring families on a Scottish housing estate
dubbed ''The Bronx'' led to the erection of a ''Berlin Wall'' between
them.
Police at Elgin, Moray, are investigating a number of alleged assaults
and have confiscated a banner with the words ''No. 56. The Family from
Hell''. Council workmen yesterday removed a barbed-wire barrier erected
by one tenant.
The families involved have been neighbours in Newmill Road, Elgin, for
three years, but now one is demanding to be rehoused by Moray District
Council.
Rosemary Jones, of 60 Newmill Road, where the banner was shown and
from whose garden fence the barbed-wire was taken, said yesterday: ''The
situation is unbearable and we are under a lot of stress.''
In council house at number 56 next door, neighbour Mrs Simpson said:
''It is in the hands of the police and the council now, so they can sort
it out.''
Moray District Council's area housing officer, Mr Martin Armstrong, is
trying to bring the Joneses and the Simpsons together to sort out their
differences.
He said: ''This is part of a long-running dispute, but we are hopeful
we can find some common ground here. We are offering the families
mediation, and we are waiting to see the result of the police inquiry
into the situation.''
Mrs Jones said yesterday: ''The only way to get peace and happiness
back into our lives is to get out of here.''
Police are investigating an alleged street brawl involving the
daughters of the warring families, and on another occasion the mothers
are alleged to have fought outside the local corner shop, but so far
no-one has been charged.

A MANHUNT was under way last night for a prisoner with Aids who
escaped from a hospital.
Mark Hearne, 29, apparently walked out of St Mary's Hospital on the
Isle of Wight after his prison guard was withdrawn when officers
received medical advice that he was not mobile.
He was serving a five-year sentence for robbery. Police said he was
considered to be a danger to the public.
The hunt for Hearne spread to the mainland after a taxi driver
reported taking him to Ryde Pier.
Hearne was serving his sentence at Camp Hill jail on the island.
He was admitted to hospital for treatment last Friday and disappeared
yesterday.
Hearne, who is from the Brighton area, was due to be released in
December next year.
Hearne is 6ft 4ins tall and has a distinctive Mexican style moustache.
He is said to be extremely slim and has close cropped black hair and a
tattoo with the name Robert on his right arm.
Earlier this year there was a massive manhunt on the island when three
prisoners serving life sentences went over the wall of the top security
Parkhurst jail.
They were caught after five days on the run when they were spotted
walking down the road by an off duty prison officer.

AN RAF base came to a halt in silent tribute yesterday as a Hercules
aircraft brought home the bodies of four soldiers killed in a helicopter
crash.
Work halted at RAF Lyneham, Wiltshire, base of the Hercules transport
fleet, as the aircraft taxied to the front of the terminal building
after a flight from Split in former Yugoslavia.
The men died on Sunday when their Lynx helicopter crashed into the sea
five miles off the Croatian coast at Ploce while on a training flight.
Comforted by an army chaplain, a small group of relatives hugged each
other as they watched the arrival of the Hercules.
Flag-draped coffins were slow-marched from the rear of the aircraft by
comrades from the Army Air Corps.
Each coffin was covered in the Union Jack and bore the Air Corps beret
and the soldier's bayonet scabbard and medals.
The men who died were part of the 24 Air Mobile Brigade contingent
with the UN Rapid Reaction Forces.
A board of inquiry has been set up into the crash, the cause of which
is as yet unknown.
Those who died were Sergeant Martin Charles Osborne, 30, married with
two children, from Wattisham, Suffolk; Ian David MacDonald, 29, married
and stationed at Gutersloh, Germany; and Air Troopers Roger Willingale,
22, from Eastbourne, Sussex, and Graham Shane Witherstone, from
Scunthorpe, south Humberside.
Air Trooper Ian Braine was the sole survivor of the crash. He swam
clear of the wreckage and was picked up uninjured by a fisherman.

POLICE are treating as attempted murder a fire in which a man was
trapped early yesterday morning.
Firefighters discovered Mr David Meiklejohn, thought to be in his 20s
and homeless, when they were called to a fire at a vacant building in
Aberdalgie Road, Easterhouse.
Mr Meiklejohn was taken to the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, and is being
treated for smoke inhalation in the intensive care unit. His condition
was described as stable last night.
He told police he had been chased into the building by three men.
It is thought the men then set the building on fire.

After years of unsuccessful attempts to modernise the West Coast main
line MURRAY HUGHES Editor of Railway Gazette sees little hope for the
future.
TODAY special trains bound for Dundee will leave London Euston at
11.35 and King's Cross at 12.04. They will streak north to Dundee as
part of commemorations marking the one hundredth anniversary of the
legendary railway races to the north -- in 1895 rival companies on the
east and west coast routes were fighting a bitter duel for supremacy in
the Anglo-Scottish business.
Were it a real race, my money would go on the east coast. Its
streamlined, IC225 trains run at 125mph through flatter terrain and are
less than 10 years old, while the track and signalling was settled up
during electrification in 1984-91.
The west coast train, in contrast, will clatter along on
infrastructure last modernised in the 1960s and 1970s where speed cannot
exceed 110mph. Electric locomotives power steadily over the famous
climbs of Shap and Beattock, but the west coast is handicapped by sharp
curves and complex junctions.
The Government's postponement of the InterCity west coast franchise is
a heavy blow to those who have campaigned for a rapid start to upgrading
of this tired railway. As passengers know only too well, renewal of
track, trains and signalling is running late.
Since the 1960s railway managers have sought three times to put new
trains on Britain's busiest long-distance rail corridor. Great hopes
were vested in the APT of the late 1970s with its tilting coaches and
other innovative technology. But after making only three trips with
fare-paying passengers in 1981, it was deemed too unreliable for
front-line InterCity-service. By 1986 APT had gone to the scrapheap.
With it perished hopes for London-Glasgow journey times of four hours,
for interest had shifted to the east coast, where electrification
brought the fastest London-Edinburgh timing under four hours in 1991.
West coast managers looked again at their railway in the late 1980s.
Their review culminated in a plan to spend #750m on upgraded track and a
fleet of 32 new IC250 trains able to run at 155mph. Sadly, like APT,
IC250 was still-born.
Then came privatisation.
The Railways Act of 1993 dismantled British Rail so completely that it
is hard not to see a malicious intent. British Rail had its faults, but
they pale into insignificance when compared with the dragon unleashed by
former Transport Secretary John MacGregor.
Rail privatisation might have worked with a less complex and more
logical structure. But the Govermment, buoyed by the success of other
privatisations, dismissed advice from railway professionals.
It charged ahead with its own ideas based on unbridled market
principles and the separation of infrastructure and operations to permit
competition between franchised passenger train companies.
Since then the icons have come tumbling down -- open access for new
operators has been postponed, freedom to charge market prices has been
replaced by Government fare caps, and any entrepreneurial spirit among
railway managers is outweighed by three new thriving bureaucracies: the
Office for Passenger Rail Franchising, the Rail Regulator, and
Railtrack, the infrastructure company which the Government wants to
float before the next election.
Yet deepest of all the flaws in the privatisation structure was the
failure to build in a mechanism to channel investment into Britain's
railways. Nowhere is this more true than on the West Coast main line.
The theory goes like this. The franchisee undertakes to pay for new
trains, leased from the yet-to-be-sold rolling stock companies, and for
better track and modern signalling, which it pays Railtrack to provide
through higher access charges. The better services and faster journey
times allow higher fares to be charged, and enough income is generated
for the franchisee to make a profit, too.
The reality is somewhat different. The fledgling Railtrack, with no
track record of managing investment projects, brought in private sector
consultants to see what needed to be done to the west coast route. They
suggested a Core Investment Programme with a price tag of #1000m. This
will buy a revolutionary radio-based signalling system that would
eliminate many lineside signals and so bring important savings in
maintenance -- and it is this that will fund the work.
The real problem is that the Core Investment Programme does not bring
higher speeds, does not iron out the curves and offers no new trains. It
would just make the service more reliable.
So where do the trains and the faster journey times come from?
According to Railtrack, ''a choice of market-driven investment options .
. . can readily be made after negotiation with the Franchising Director
and the prospective franchisees.'' In other words the franchisee would
pay for what the customers want most, but potential franchisees have
just been told not to bother to apply.
What will happen now? The best to be hoped for is that Railtrack
implement its Core Investment Programme without serious delay. Nine
companies have been asked to tender for the signalling work, and bids go
in next month.
Railtrack then hopes to shortlist three companies before making a
further assessment. Two will be asked to build prototype equipment and
prove that it works. By then it could be early 1997.
After that comes the difficult process of safety validation. At best,
installation could start in 2001 with the first equipment going live in
2003.
However the supplier is expected to assume much of the development
cost, and who pays for what and when is far from clear. The technical
risks are considerable, and the complexity of the west coast route
handling 2000 trains a day is daunting. Given that the future
franchisee's wishes will also have to be accommodated, even 2003 may be
optimistic.
Long before then there will be a General Election. A change in
Government could see a transport policy favouring railways, with money
switched from road building to rail investment.

A NEW book on international pop group Wet, Wet, Wet was banned
yesterday by a Scottish judge.
The 10,000 copies of the book entitled Wet, Wet, Wet -- A Sweet Little
Mystery, by Brian Beacom, will not now go on the shelves because of an
alleged breach of the group's trademark, which is registered as Wet,
Wet, Wet.
At the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Lord Sutherland granted interim
interdict to the pop group associate company Bravado Merchandising
Services, of St John's Wood, London, banning Edinburgh publishers
Mainstream from selling or distributing the biography of the showbiz
life of the pop group.
Mr Calum MacNeill, advocate for Bravado, complained that the company
was the registered owner of the trade mark Wet, Wet, Wet and it should
not have been used on the book cover or dust jacket of what was
described as an unauthorised biography.
Mr MacNeill said Bravado acted on the group's behalf in matters
relating to merchandising.
It intended to publish a book on the group in December 1995 and sales
of the biography would harm sales and affect royalties and the public
might be confused.
He said the Wet Wet Wet sign on the book used by Mainstream, the book
publishers, was identical to the pop group's trade mark ''Wet, Wet,
Wet'' which was registered in 1989.
Mr Stephen Woolman, advocate for Mainstream publishers, argued that
the use of the words Wet, Wet, Wet were not an infringment of a trade
mark in this case because the wording was on a book and not on something
like a tee-shirt.
He told the court that, if the ban was imposed in the meantime, the
10,000 copies of the book already printed would have to be shelved,
leading to a #60,000 loss.
He said the books also bore a large sticker with the words
''Unauthorised biography'' so that the public would not be confused with
the new authorised publication due out in December. He said arrangements
could be made to change the dustcover on the book.
However, the judge Lord Sutherland, who was shown a copy of the
unauthorised biography pointed out that the words Wet, Wet, Wet were on
the spine of the book as well as on the dust cover.
Mr Woolman told the court that Mainstream was first approached in 1993
by the group's manager Elliot Davies and the author Brian Beacom, a
journalist on The Herald's sister paper, the Evening Times. On December
16, 1994, the publishers entered into a contract with Mr Beacom to write
a book about the group and sold the serialisation rights to the Evening
Times.
It appeared in the paper in four instalments beginning on July 9 this
year, accompanied by the proposed dust jacket. He said the publishers
were not using the name Wet, Wet, Wet as a trademark. It was used in the
title to indicate the subject matter of the book. The other book on the
pop group due out in December was in pictorial form and could not be
confused with the present biography.
Lord Sutherland granted interim interdict to Bravado Merchandising
Services of London on behalf of Wet, Wet, Wet, temporarily banning the
sale or distribution of the book.
The judge said the balance of convenience favoured his granting the
court order to Bravado, who could have an arguable claim at any full
hearing of the case in the future.
''I do consider that an arguable case has been made out. It is quite
clear that this particular book cover has reference to this particular
pop group and may well be a contravention of their trade mark
registration.''
The balance of convenience in granting the interim interdict favoured
Bravado because it proposed to publish its book in December and the
number of copies sold might be affected by the present publication.

EIGHT people were rescued from a Largs-based yacht which ran aground
on rocks 150 yards off Turnberry Point on the Ayrshire coast last night.
Four on board the Belle Elaine were landed by coastguards at Troon and
the remainder were lifted off by a Royal Navy helicopter rescue
helicopter from Prestwick. All eight were reported uninjured.
Clyde coastguards received a Mayday signal at 10.35pm and called out
lifeboats from Troon and Girvan and the rescue helicopter. A number of
local boats were also involved in the operation.
A coastguard spokesman said conditions were ''not very good'', with
winds force five or six.

ANOTHER Scottish Labour council yesterday found itself at the centre
of serious allegations over the way a senior appointment was handled.
A formal complaint about the way the post of social work director for
the new North Lanarkshire authority was filled has been lodged with the
Staff Commission.
It could lead to the embattled commission asking the Scottish
Secretary -- for the first time -- to order the council to rerun the
procedure.
Commission chairman Robert Peggie and his team have been under
pressure from Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch to crack
down on councils perceived to have acted improperly in filling top
posts.
North Lanarkshire, of which Monklands district is a part, insisted it
had acted in ''a fair, proper and objective manner''. However, public
service union Unison said the appointments procedure was ''manifestly
unfair''.
The complaint has been made by Mr Ian Gilmour, social work depute
director with Strathclyde region, who applied for the North Lanarkshire
post.
It eventually went to Mr David McKendrick, a divisional manager in
Strathclyde's social work department. The new director will be forced to
retire on age grounds a few months after the council becomes fully
operational next April.
Mr Gilmour's complaint centres on the fact that Councillor James
Coyle, who sat on the selection committee, is a junior member of Mr
Gilmour's staff at Strathclyde.
Mr Coyle is a member of Motherwell District Council and of the North
Lanarkshire authority.
In a letter to the commission, Unison's head of local government
employees in Scotland, Mr Mark Irvine, says the participation on the
selection panel of a junior member of his staff placed Mr Gilmour in ''a
completely invidious position''. He goes on: ''My purpose in writing is
to advise the Staff Commission that Unison supports Mr Gilmour's
complaint and to confirm our view that, in relation to this particular
post, the appointments process has not operated in a fair and
even-handed manner.''
Mr Andrew Cowe, North Lanarkshire's new chief executive, said the
council would co-operate fully with the commission but insisted that, at
the time the appointment was made, the membership of its selection
committee complied fully with all statutory requirements.
If the commission decides to act, it could ask North Lanarkshire to
rerun the procedure. If it refused, its next move would likely be to ask
the Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to step in.

THE bizarre scenario in which rail passengers could choose to travel
between Scotland and London on a West Coast main line in the public
sector -- or an East Coast main line in private hands -- looms ever
closer.
Labour's celebrations over the news that the West Coast line will not
now be sold before this side of a General Election continued loud and
long yesterday.
However, it was muted when asked, should power be won, it if could
possibly permit the flagship cross-border artery -- East Coast InterCity
-- to stay in private hands while an ageing West Coast line competed for
business under State control.
Labour was equally muted when asked to explain how it would finance
the #600m to #1bn modernisation works desperately needed for the West
Coast line.
Several of its Scottish MPs also struggled to say what a Labour
Government would do if they found -- as rail industry experts predict --
that at least 40% of the UK network was sold and in private hands by the
next election, due in 1997 at the latest.
They merely repeated the party's declared commitment to a
publicly-owned railway. Not one even hinted that a re-nationalisation of
the railways would be ordered. Indeed, they could not even bring
themselves to use the word.
One MP, who asked not to be named, argued that it made sense not to
say what the party would do because the future of rail privatisation was
''unravelling by the day''.
He added that Labour's declared policy of a publicly-owned, integrated
railway was a clear message.
It would only be admitting defeat in the campaign to halt the sell-off
by talking about returning everything to State control: ''The railways
have not gone yet, and there is no reason for us to suggest that they
will.''
One other reason was cited for not pledging to renationalise any bits
that are sold: the Tories would ''hang some absurd spending commitments
around our necks, and we're not falling into that trap''.
However, Labour's Scottish transport spokesman Henry McLeish at least
offered some insight into the party's plans, although his comments
raised more questions that answers.
However, his response -- including a statement that a Labour
Government would seek a public-private partnership for the billion-pound
refurbishment programme for the West Coast main line -- certainly did
not satisfy the Railway Development Society (Scotland) or Scottish
Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, for different reasons.
Mr Ken Sutherland, the pressure group's secretary, said: ''It is time
it gave a forthright commitment to renationalise, and provided a clear
framework for investment. It would be an electoral winner because many
people have no stomach for what the Government is trying to do to the
railways.''
However, Lord James last night accused Labour of ''double standards''
and lacking policies on rail privatisation.
He demanded Labour explain fully where they stand. Would they
re-nationalise? How would they encourage more passengers and freight?
And would they invest in the railways with more taxpayers' money?
Potential bidders for the West Coast franchise, the largest of the 25
passenger franchises up for sale, have privately told the Government
they are not prepared to bid until arrangements for financing the line's
track and signalling modernisation are in place.
Mr McLeish said yesterday that the core of the problem was the
Government's Private Finance Initiative, designed to involve private
finance in public projects.
Potential investors had been scared off by the confusion and chaos
surrounding the Government's relentless drive to privatise the line
despite doubts over who meets refurbishment costs.
However, the MP signalled that a Labour Government would hope to
reassess PFI in the hope that private sector investment for major
infrastructure projects could be attracted.
Mr McLeish said it was possible to create the right conditions in
which private capital for public works would be available.
The Tories had got it wrong because they expected the private sector
to take all risks on the West Coast line. The train operator would not
only be expected to help fund the upgrading, but to meet the increased
access charges which would follow from Railtrack, which is responsible
for infrastructure.
He said risk control was crucial, and hinted a Labour Government would
help share the risks by using public money which was currently going on
privatisation.
Mr McLeish estimated the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, in
charge of the sell-offs, was already subsidising train operating
franchises to the tune of #2 billion-a-year.
Mr McLeish said Labour was committed to modernise the West Coast main
line, described by the current Government as the backbone of the UK
network.
The party's Treasury team expects to produce a transport policy
document in November. It is unlikely to spell out specific instances
where investment will be guaranteed, although firm indications of how to
generate that investment will be offered.
Mr McLeish said: ''Our stated policy is for a public-owned,
publicly-accountable railway, and in the 18-20 months to go before an
election we will campaign to stop privatisation.
''The challenge facing a Labour Government will be to overcome the
mess that is inherited. Some 95 bits of the railway network are being
sold, but I believe only a handful of the 25 train operators will be in
the private sector by the election. That is one issue which has to be
looked at.''
Meanwhile, it has been learned the Government plans to bring forward
the sale of two rail routes to save face over postponing disposal of the
West Coast line.
It is thought the Government will bring forward the sales of South
Eastern lines from London to Margate, Dover and Hastings -- and one
other route, the tiny Chiltern lines, from mid-1996 to the end of this
year.
